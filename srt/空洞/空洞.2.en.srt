1
00:01:41,526 --> 00:01:44,465
(I asked you to give my phone back...)

2
00:01:44,465 --> 00:01:47,265
I asked you to give my phone back, but why did you send a weird photo?

3
00:01:55,276 --> 00:01:58,176
By the way, I've seen this Da Bin girl.

4
00:02:14,525 --> 00:02:16,555
After six years of construction,

5
00:02:16,555 --> 00:02:19,365
Deokpung-daero, the East Sea Route, is finally open.

6
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:22,765
The construction began in 2014.

7
00:02:22,765 --> 00:02:26,765
This is the second longest route after Jangmun Highway.

8
00:02:26,835 --> 00:02:31,175
Just the section above the water is no less than 18km long.

9
00:02:31,876 --> 00:02:34,346
The Road Traffic Authority will allow vehicles...

10
00:02:34,346 --> 00:02:36,045
to drive on this route freely for a month...

11
00:02:36,045 --> 00:02:37,645
starting August 10 as their plan.

12
00:02:37,645 --> 00:02:39,585
- Hello? - We need to meet.

13
00:02:40,485 --> 00:02:41,656
Let's meet and talk.

14
00:02:41,855 --> 00:02:43,256
Are you going to give me back my phone?

15
00:02:43,585 --> 00:02:45,955
If you really saw Da Bin,

16
00:02:46,726 --> 00:02:48,025
I'm willing to buy you 100 phones.

17
00:02:48,025 --> 00:02:49,425
But if you're lying,

18
00:02:50,865 --> 00:02:52,166
you're going to pay for it.

19
00:02:59,365 --> 00:03:00,906
I have a lot to say too.

20
00:03:02,006 --> 00:03:03,105
Let's meet tomorrow.

21
00:03:12,386 --> 00:03:13,955
And about your flyer...

22
00:03:14,585 --> 00:03:16,485
I think you got the date wrong.

23
00:03:16,816 --> 00:03:19,055
It's August right now, but it says September.

24
00:03:20,055 --> 00:03:21,055
You should check.

25
00:03:29,066 --> 00:03:30,096
It's...

26
00:03:33,136 --> 00:03:34,536
What does she mean it's August?

27
00:03:46,886 --> 00:03:49,115
Do you think you can use the bathroom by yourself?

28
00:03:49,216 --> 00:03:51,525
Yes. I'm feeling much better thanks to everyone.

29
00:03:52,256 --> 00:03:54,555
Where can I get some water?

30
00:03:55,126 --> 00:03:58,395
Turn right, and it's at the end of the hallway.

31
00:03:59,226 --> 00:04:03,036
In emergency cases, press the bell over there.

32
00:04:03,036 --> 00:04:04,735
Okay. Thank you.

33
00:04:04,865 --> 00:04:09,175
(Complete Rest)

34
00:04:15,175 --> 00:04:16,346
Ms. Kwak Song Ja?

35
00:04:18,986 --> 00:04:20,116
Who are you?

36
00:04:29,126 --> 00:04:31,496
(Episode 2)

37
00:05:20,475 --> 00:05:23,176
I've been waiting for an hour. Please pick up.

38
00:05:25,816 --> 00:05:28,655
(My Daughter)

39
00:05:38,996 --> 00:05:40,196
Your call cannot be connected.

40
00:05:40,196 --> 00:05:42,196
You'll be redirected to voice mail.

41
00:05:46,405 --> 00:05:47,475
Darn it.

42
00:06:22,936 --> 00:06:24,645
Was there a woman looking for her phone?

43
00:06:24,645 --> 00:06:25,806
No.

44
00:06:35,785 --> 00:06:37,926
(Mr. Park Ho Young)

45
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:41,126
- Yes? - Could you come to the station?

46
00:06:42,056 --> 00:06:43,196
Ma'am.

47
00:06:44,296 --> 00:06:46,725
I'm sorry, but could you move to another spot?

48
00:06:48,165 --> 00:06:49,366
I'm sorry.

49
00:06:59,306 --> 00:07:00,946
I'm certain this is the place.

50
00:07:01,816 --> 00:07:03,746
He should at least pick up the phone.

51
00:07:04,446 --> 00:07:05,986
Gosh, what a scammer.

52
00:07:06,585 --> 00:07:07,856
Darn it.

53
00:07:18,126 --> 00:07:20,465
(Missing Child)

54
00:07:22,996 --> 00:07:27,636
(Date of Disappearance: September 6, 2020, around 8pm)

55
00:07:27,636 --> 00:07:29,606
(Date of Disappearance: August 6, 2020, around 8pm)

56
00:07:33,876 --> 00:07:35,446
Even though he's a scammer,

57
00:07:37,446 --> 00:07:38,585
her daughter is innocent.

58
00:07:48,895 --> 00:07:50,155
Have you still not gotten your phone back?

59
00:07:50,325 --> 00:07:52,866
I even sent him a threatening message.

60
00:07:52,996 --> 00:07:55,136
Hey, don't get me started.

61
00:07:55,196 --> 00:07:57,296
I got stood up for three hours today.

62
00:07:57,606 --> 00:07:58,636
Gosh.

63
00:07:59,066 --> 00:08:00,465
Just terminate the number.

64
00:08:00,765 --> 00:08:02,075
The moment he inserts a new SIM card,

65
00:08:02,075 --> 00:08:03,575
the phone company will know right away.

66
00:08:04,075 --> 00:08:05,446
I should still get back my phone.

67
00:08:05,876 --> 00:08:08,275
I actually terminated my number just a while ago.

68
00:08:09,975 --> 00:08:12,686
Hey, Mom can finally eat whatever she wants again, right?

69
00:08:13,686 --> 00:08:15,415
I bought her favourite.

70
00:08:15,686 --> 00:08:17,316
What is it? I'm starving.

71
00:08:17,626 --> 00:08:18,686
Dumplings.

72
00:08:18,886 --> 00:08:20,626
- They must be tasty. - Can she have them, though?

73
00:08:21,056 --> 00:08:23,056
- I'll ask the doctor. - Okay.

74
00:08:30,265 --> 00:08:32,435
What? Did she move her room?

75
00:08:45,716 --> 00:08:48,015
Did Ms. Kwak Song Ja in Room 35 change the room?

76
00:08:48,315 --> 00:08:50,055
She was discharged.

77
00:08:51,326 --> 00:08:52,326
What?

78
00:08:53,326 --> 00:08:54,956
We were surprised too.

79
00:08:54,956 --> 00:08:56,226
She didn't discuss it with us,

80
00:08:56,226 --> 00:08:57,866
and the professor didn't say anything either.

81
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,165
But she went to the Administration Department...

82
00:08:59,165 --> 00:09:00,695
and signed the discharge forms herself.

83
00:09:01,366 --> 00:09:04,096
What's going on? Did she not say anything to you?

84
00:09:06,006 --> 00:09:07,636
Focus. Call her right now.

85
00:09:13,145 --> 00:09:14,376
I have...

86
00:09:16,315 --> 00:09:17,445
her phone.

87
00:09:19,246 --> 00:09:20,515
Does that mean you can't reach her?

88
00:09:27,456 --> 00:09:28,456
Mom.

89
00:09:29,956 --> 00:09:31,096
Mom!

90
00:09:36,096 --> 00:09:37,165
Mom.

91
00:09:50,616 --> 00:09:52,386
Ma'am, did my mom stop by today?

92
00:09:52,386 --> 00:09:53,645
No, she didn't. Why?

93
00:10:09,295 --> 00:10:11,866
- Ma'am, have you seen my mom? - No, I haven't.

94
00:10:17,275 --> 00:10:19,545
About that bike that delivered the parcel...

95
00:10:20,076 --> 00:10:21,175
Did you track it?

96
00:10:21,445 --> 00:10:23,076
It's not that easy to track.

97
00:10:23,145 --> 00:10:26,545
The license plate is tiny, and the CCTV footage was too grainy.

98
00:10:26,685 --> 00:10:29,716
It's not easy to identify the number, but we have.

99
00:10:30,856 --> 00:10:32,555
We looked through the black boxes of all the vehicles...

100
00:10:32,555 --> 00:10:33,655
that drove on the same road as that bike.

101
00:10:33,886 --> 00:10:35,956
And miraculously, we found the number.

102
00:10:36,356 --> 00:10:38,425
This is the suspect's information.

103
00:10:38,925 --> 00:10:40,165
(Workplace: Quick Brothers, Sungjin Labour Force)

104
00:10:40,165 --> 00:10:43,265
What's odd is that he's not demanding a ransom.

105
00:10:43,596 --> 00:10:46,035
That means there must be resentment.

106
00:10:47,366 --> 00:10:48,535
Do you know him?

107
00:10:48,706 --> 00:10:51,645
No. Not at all.

108
00:10:54,746 --> 00:10:56,775
He may have an accomplice.

109
00:11:00,116 --> 00:11:01,716
But it's just too strange.

110
00:11:01,716 --> 00:11:03,116
(Trustworthy Police, Safe Country)

111
00:11:03,116 --> 00:11:06,356
If he was a stranger, it wouldn't have been easy...

112
00:11:06,356 --> 00:11:09,055
to leave the premises with the girl among all those people.

113
00:11:24,035 --> 00:11:26,106
Even if you trip over, you won't break your legs.

114
00:11:40,756 --> 00:11:43,126
- Ma'am. - Mr. Kim.

115
00:11:47,096 --> 00:11:50,035
Did anyone meet Da Bin other than me and my wife?

116
00:11:50,136 --> 00:11:51,765
I doubt it.

117
00:11:52,035 --> 00:11:54,265
You know she comes and goes with the kindergarten bus.

118
00:11:54,265 --> 00:11:55,405
What about you?

119
00:11:57,275 --> 00:11:58,976
Where were you, and what were you doing...

120
00:11:59,076 --> 00:12:00,645
on the day Da Bin disappeared?

121
00:12:04,346 --> 00:12:07,645
Mr. Kim. I know it's tough...

122
00:12:07,645 --> 00:12:09,785
Whether it's the CCTV footage or event pictures,

123
00:12:09,785 --> 00:12:11,015
anything is okay.

124
00:12:11,555 --> 00:12:13,586
Please give me all data related to Da Bin.

125
00:12:14,293 --> 00:12:16,064
Pictures and profiles of all teachers too.

126
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:19,474
Every one of them, please. I beg you.

127
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,574
Wait here.

128
00:12:53,133 --> 00:12:54,434
Who is it?

129
00:12:55,803 --> 00:12:58,314
Police. Here's the search warrant.

130
00:13:01,684 --> 00:13:02,783
- 2 in the bedroom over there. - Yes, sir.

131
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:03,944
1 in the balcony.

132
00:13:07,283 --> 00:13:08,883
Are you here because of Da Bin?

133
00:13:08,883 --> 00:13:11,084
I've already said everything about her.

134
00:13:14,053 --> 00:13:15,163
Hey. Over here.

135
00:13:15,724 --> 00:13:16,864
Well...

136
00:13:19,734 --> 00:13:21,133
- Get out of the way. - But...

137
00:13:25,173 --> 00:13:28,074
There's nothing in here.

138
00:13:29,503 --> 00:13:32,673
- Move aside. - No. Wait.

139
00:13:42,684 --> 00:13:45,324
I don't know what happened to Da Bin.

140
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:48,094
I'm serious.

141
00:13:48,964 --> 00:13:51,094
- You need to come with us. - My goodness.

142
00:13:52,334 --> 00:13:54,434
I don't know what happened to her.

143
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:57,903
They were throwing out expensive clothes after 1 or 2 uses.

144
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,773
I took them because they were a waste.

145
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,474
I don't know what happened to Da Bin.

146
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:04,574
Then where did you suddenly get that much money?

147
00:14:04,574 --> 00:14:07,043
I told you already!

148
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:08,883
I got paid back from the borrower.

149
00:14:08,883 --> 00:14:10,944
This is crazy.

150
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:13,184
What were you going to do with all her clothes?

151
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:16,053
I sold them in the secondhand store.

152
00:14:16,153 --> 00:14:18,293
I don't know. I don't remember anything.

153
00:14:20,153 --> 00:14:21,224
I verified where the money came from.

154
00:14:21,224 --> 00:14:22,293
Do I have to say even things like that?

155
00:14:22,293 --> 00:14:23,623
Is everything she said true?

156
00:14:23,793 --> 00:14:26,334
Yes. Her testimony is consistent.

157
00:14:26,834 --> 00:14:28,234
We've confirmed the truth.

158
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:33,033
She's a petty thief, but not a kidnapper?

159
00:14:33,503 --> 00:14:34,974
My goodness.

160
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,474
What about the delivery guy?

161
00:14:37,173 --> 00:14:38,614
That sneaky punk.

162
00:14:39,013 --> 00:14:40,574
Detective Kang is in an ambush.

163
00:14:41,373 --> 00:14:42,913
(Missing Child)

164
00:14:47,913 --> 00:14:49,053
(Personnel record)

165
00:15:21,824 --> 00:15:23,253
Only if there was a witness...

166

(Contact)

167
00:15:42,704 --> 00:15:45,173
Your call cannot be connected.

168
00:16:00,623 --> 00:16:01,923
Mom.

169
00:16:04,623 --> 00:16:06,734
Mom. Where are you?

170
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:12,974
What if you pass out again while staying alone?

171
00:16:27,883 --> 00:16:29,854
(Where are you? Pick up the phone.)

172
00:16:29,854 --> 00:16:31,224
Why didn't you keep your promise?

173
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:33,094
Do you know what it's like to lose a child?

174
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,224
Seriously.

175
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:39,064
He's the one who didn't keep his promise.

176
00:16:49,173 --> 00:16:52,513
Look. You're the one that didn't keep your promise.

177
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:54,114
Everything you say is a lie.

178
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:56,283
You didn't show up!

179
00:16:56,283 --> 00:16:58,684
I waited three hours for you there.

180
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,814
If you can't trust me, ask the employees there.

181
00:17:01,283 --> 00:17:04,153
Were you really there in the café at noon?

182
00:17:04,153 --> 00:17:06,624
From 12pm to 3pm, I ordered 1 juice and waited.

183
00:17:06,624 --> 00:17:08,224
I had to leave because I felt uncomfortable.

184
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:13,964
I waited over two hours in that café.

185
00:17:14,093 --> 00:17:15,763
It's impossible that we didn't see each other...

186
00:17:15,763 --> 00:17:17,434
in such a small space when we were there for hours.

187
00:17:18,773 --> 00:17:23,603
How can you make such lie over a missing child? How?

188
00:17:23,603 --> 00:17:25,313
I can't believe you.

189
00:17:26,174 --> 00:17:29,184
I knew you were a fraud, but I still went for the child.

190
00:17:29,283 --> 00:17:30,283
I even put up the flyer...

191
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:32,553
you sent me on the bulletin at the café!

192
00:17:32,654 --> 00:17:34,853
And you got the date wrong, so I even fixed that for you.

193
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:35,884
Don't you think you're a bit too rude?

194
00:17:35,884 --> 00:17:37,724
Why do you keep talking about the date?

195
00:17:38,184 --> 00:17:40,394
I can sue you for a scam!

196
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:42,363
You stop lying, for goodness' sake!

197
00:17:57,204 --> 00:18:00,273
This is over. I'm never picking up his calls again.

198
00:18:00,974 --> 00:18:02,513
I got the number terminated.

199
00:18:07,113 --> 00:18:09,353
How is he calling with the terminated number?

200
00:18:12,753 --> 00:18:16,164
(Police)

201
00:18:45,154 --> 00:18:48,924
(Mr. Park Ho Young)

202
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,134
Hello?

203
00:18:55,763 --> 00:18:57,704
Is the suspect you arrested the culprit?

204
00:18:57,704 --> 00:18:59,303
Have you found Kim Da Bin's body?

205
00:18:59,303 --> 00:19:00,434
What's his motive?

206
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:05,313
Sir. I only delivered the parcel.

207
00:19:05,573 --> 00:19:08,343
Then why did you run away like you were guilty?

208
00:19:08,343 --> 00:19:11,613
Seriously. Because you were chasing me.

209
00:19:11,954 --> 00:19:14,454
I was scared because you were chasing me, so I ran.

210
00:19:14,783 --> 00:19:18,124
I went crazy when I saw the news.

211
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,494
- Have you confirmed it? - Wait.

212
00:19:26,494 --> 00:19:27,793
Are you sure the victim is dead?

213
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:31,003
We'll have a briefing when we get the result.

214
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,273
- When will you get the result? - Any possibility of an accomplice?

215
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:35,174
- Mr. Kim! - How are you sure?

216
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,603
- Excuse me. - Officer!

217
00:19:37,603 --> 00:19:39,374
- How are the parents? - Officer!

218
00:19:39,374 --> 00:19:41,573
(Violent Crimes Team Three)

219
00:19:46,484 --> 00:19:49,083
Mr. Kim. Mr. Kim!

220
00:19:49,184 --> 00:19:52,353
I just went to the address I got!

221
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:54,353
There was a box!

222
00:19:54,353 --> 00:19:56,063
It's true!

223
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:58,934
- Is doing my work a sin? - Die!

224
00:19:59,194 --> 00:20:00,863
I will kill you.

225
00:20:00,863 --> 00:20:02,904
- I didn't do it. - What is it?

226
00:20:02,904 --> 00:20:04,704
What did you do to my daughter?

227
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:06,103
Get out.

228
00:20:06,103 --> 00:20:08,003
- I'm going to kill him myself! - Please calm down.

229
00:20:08,704 --> 00:20:10,343
- What are you doing? - Let go!

230
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:12,144
Let me go.

231
00:20:27,553 --> 00:20:29,563
What are you doing? I thought you quit smoking.

232
00:20:31,394 --> 00:20:33,634
It's not easy to quit smoking doing this job.

233
00:20:34,694 --> 00:20:37,404
- What about Mr. Kim? - I barely sent him home.

234
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,134
He couldn't even control his body.

235
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:42,103
Maybe I should've sent him to the hospital.

236
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:45,714
Oh, and I don't think it's the delivery guy.

237
00:20:46,714 --> 00:20:47,714
- Right? - Yes.

238
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:50,144
He has no motive.

239
00:20:50,644 --> 00:20:53,484
That means the culprit is somebody else.

240
00:20:56,124 --> 00:20:58,384
Let's wait for the component analysis result first.

241
00:20:59,394 --> 00:21:01,694
- Sure. - Goodness.

242
00:21:13,603 --> 00:21:15,174
If you're not going to behave, go home.

243
00:21:15,303 --> 00:21:17,974
I'm going to see Mom playing the violin.

244
00:21:19,343 --> 00:21:20,714
Then you need to stay quiet.

245
00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:22,684
You scared everyone. Look what you've done.

246
00:21:51,613 --> 00:21:52,683
Hello? This is Kim Seo Jin.

247
00:21:52,883 --> 00:21:54,583
We just got the result of the analysis.

248
00:21:59,153 --> 00:22:00,192
The result says...

249
00:22:01,222 --> 00:22:02,292
they do not match.

250
00:22:07,532 --> 00:22:08,603
Hello?

251
00:22:11,762 --> 00:22:13,002
Hello? Mr. Kim.

252
00:22:15,202 --> 00:22:17,143
Then what will happen to the investigation?

253
00:22:18,772 --> 00:22:22,542
The delivery man has a solid alibi at the time...

254
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,442
of Da Bin's disappearance.

255
00:22:24,942 --> 00:22:27,653
He'll be indicted for abetting the abandonment of a dead body.

256
00:22:28,623 --> 00:22:29,823
Abandoning a dead body?

257
00:22:32,722 --> 00:22:34,393
Do you really think...

258
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:38,685
Da Bin and Hyun Chae are dead?

259
00:22:39,133 --> 00:22:42,363
Considering how we still haven't found them,

260
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:44,032
I'd say the chance is very low.

261
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:46,732
I understand how you feel, Mr. Kim.

262
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:51,103
But in this situation, we'll be able to catch the culprit faster...

263
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:53,012
if we find their bodies.

264
00:22:53,613 --> 00:22:55,183
Let's see how the investigation goes.

265
00:22:55,212 --> 00:22:56,542
Please tell me.

266
00:23:01,853 --> 00:23:03,423
What can I do?

267
00:23:05,052 --> 00:23:06,093
I don't even know...

268
00:23:07,522 --> 00:23:08,563
whether my wife...

269
00:23:10,462 --> 00:23:13,292
and my daughter are dead or alive.

270
00:23:14,633 --> 00:23:16,232
How could a useless man like me do anything?

271
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:22,442
Mr. Kim.

272
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:25,512
You need to do what you can do.

273
00:23:25,542 --> 00:23:27,143
Everything already has happened.

274
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,813
If I can't turn back the time, must I accept the reality?

275
00:23:35,722 --> 00:23:37,022
I can't do that.

276
00:24:19,393 --> 00:24:20,593
Is anybody there?

277
00:24:24,633 --> 00:24:26,202
Is anyone around?

278
00:25:22,992 --> 00:25:24,792
(Message from Mr. Seo)

279
00:25:24,792 --> 00:25:28,732
Mr. Kim, there's a written report regarding Mountain Hill's materials.

280
00:25:37,843 --> 00:25:40,012
Hello? Da Bin...

281
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:42,913
- She's with you, right? - Do you want to see her?

282
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:45,583
Let me talk to her.

283
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,512
I want to hear...

284
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:49,722
her voice.

285
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:53,623
Please! I beg you. I'll give you everything you want.

286
00:25:53,992 --> 00:25:56,063
Please let me talk to her!

287
00:25:56,423 --> 00:25:58,022
I will give you all the money you want.

288
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:00,133
Please just send her back home in one piece.

289
00:26:00,133 --> 00:26:02,532
- I beg you. - Please!

290
00:26:03,002 --> 00:26:04,333
- She will go back home tomorrow. - Please...

291
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:08,073
- Hello? - Finally.

292
00:26:08,472 --> 00:26:10,942
You picked up my phone, right? Please give it back.

293
00:26:11,173 --> 00:26:12,313
Who is this?

294
00:26:12,313 --> 00:26:14,942
I'm the owner of the phone you're using right now.

295
00:26:14,942 --> 00:26:17,643
- You called the wrong number. - Could you lower the volume?

296
00:26:17,683 --> 00:26:19,353
It will approach Korea.

297
00:26:19,353 --> 00:26:21,653
Hello? I did call the right number.

298
00:26:21,653 --> 00:26:23,222
That's my phone.

299
00:26:23,222 --> 00:26:25,492
(Call Record)

300
00:26:25,492 --> 00:26:26,853
Who is this?

301
00:26:27,022 --> 00:26:29,462
I'm the owner of the phone you're using right now.

302
00:26:29,522 --> 00:26:31,063
Typhoon Chamsae is moving north...

303
00:26:31,093 --> 00:26:33,032
- from Okinawa as of now... - Ma'am!

304
00:26:33,032 --> 00:26:35,163
(Call Record)

305
00:26:35,163 --> 00:26:38,462
A typhoon warning will be issued on the eastern coast.

306
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:41,232
Typhoon Chamsae is moving north...

307
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:43,873
from Okinawa as of now, August 8. In the afternoon of August 9...

308
00:26:44,143 --> 00:26:45,673
Who is this?

309
00:26:46,212 --> 00:26:48,782
Typhoon Chamsae is moving north...

310
00:26:48,782 --> 00:26:50,113
from Okinawa as of now, August 8.

311
00:26:50,183 --> 00:26:51,542
In the afternoon of August 9,

312
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:54,853
- it will approach Korea. - Ma'am! Could you lower the volume?

313
00:27:01,752 --> 00:27:02,863
May I ask you a question?

314
00:27:03,563 --> 00:27:06,433
Was there a woman who came alone after 12pm the day before yesterday?

315
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,933
I'm not sure. I can't remember because we had too many customers.

316
00:27:12,502 --> 00:27:14,702
Then by any chance,

317
00:27:14,702 --> 00:27:18,242
is there a bulletin or anything that's used to put up flyers?

318
00:27:42,532 --> 00:27:43,802
Have I gone insane?

319
00:27:45,573 --> 00:27:46,633
Fine.

320
00:27:47,573 --> 00:27:49,042
That's the least I can do.

321
00:27:57,613 --> 00:28:00,252
(Missing Child)

322
00:28:02,052 --> 00:28:05,423
I even put up the flyer you sent me on the bulletin at the café!

323
00:28:05,653 --> 00:28:08,252
And you got the date wrong, so I even fixed that for you.

324
00:28:08,292 --> 00:28:09,522
Don't you think you're a bit too rude?

325
00:28:12,063 --> 00:28:13,063
(Date of Disappearance: August 6, 2020, around 8pm)

326
00:28:13,063 --> 00:28:14,593
And about your flyer...

327
00:28:15,192 --> 00:28:17,133
I think you got the date wrong.

328
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:19,472
It's August right now, but it says September.

329
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:21,633
You should check.

330
00:28:23,972 --> 00:28:26,042
Your call cannot be connected. You'll be redirected to voice mail.

331
00:28:27,813 --> 00:28:30,242
This is Kim Seo Jin. Give me a call.

332
00:28:31,913 --> 00:28:33,113
Please, I ask of you.

333
00:28:40,353 --> 00:28:41,423
Is this the hospital?

334
00:28:41,752 --> 00:28:43,522
I'm Ms. Kwak Song Ja's guardian.

335
00:28:44,323 --> 00:28:46,833
Did you receive any calls today?

336
00:28:50,202 --> 00:28:51,262
I see.

337
00:28:52,972 --> 00:28:54,173
All right.

338
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:07,452
Ae Ri.

339
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,123
- You're here. - Didn't you go out to work today?

340
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:16,762
I didn't know when Mom would come, so I stayed home today.

341
00:29:18,093 --> 00:29:19,093
Have you eaten?

342
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:22,732
Did you report her as missing?

343
00:29:23,363 --> 00:29:26,603
I did, but the police can't do much either.

344
00:29:30,972 --> 00:29:33,012
I shouldn't have met that scammer back then.

345
00:29:34,913 --> 00:29:36,542
I should've gone to see Mom.

346
00:29:38,952 --> 00:29:40,683
I want to turn back the time.

347
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:44,653
No matter how much I think about it, he sounds completely absurd.

348
00:29:45,952 --> 00:29:48,353
He kept insisting he was there to meet me.

349
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:49,823
I couldn't believe it.

350
00:29:52,863 --> 00:29:55,802
Anyway, there was something really weird.

351
00:29:56,502 --> 00:29:57,603
What's weird?

352
00:29:58,833 --> 00:30:00,472
I got that number terminated,

353
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:04,073
but he keeps calling me with that number.

354
00:30:05,873 --> 00:30:09,113
That sounds like an urban legend. I guess you got confused. Forget it.

355
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,083
Are you going to work tomorrow?

356
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:16,752
I already took two days off.

357
00:30:17,383 --> 00:30:19,552
Geon Wook filled in for me yesterday, though.

358
00:30:20,623 --> 00:30:23,992
He ignored my calls all day long. Man, Im Geon Wook.

359
00:30:24,593 --> 00:30:26,863
He'd do anything you say.

360
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:09,173
Geon Wook.

361
00:31:11,343 --> 00:31:12,742
Hey, Geon Wook.

362
00:31:13,212 --> 00:31:15,173
Come on out, Geon Wook. Open the door.

363
00:31:16,512 --> 00:31:17,583
Geon Wook!

364
00:31:31,363 --> 00:31:32,762
Geon Wook.

365
00:31:39,903 --> 00:31:41,603
If I catch you, I'll kill you.

366
00:31:48,173 --> 00:31:49,913
Hey, long time no see.

367
00:32:14,002 --> 00:32:15,433
- Please spare my life. - Hey!

368
00:32:16,542 --> 00:32:18,603
Please let me... Spare my life.

369
00:32:22,012 --> 00:32:23,782
- Hey, man. Enough. - That's enough.

370
00:32:24,843 --> 00:32:27,683
- This little punk has no manners. - This punk!

371
00:32:28,183 --> 00:32:30,282
Why did you ignore our calls and went out of touch?

372
00:32:30,923 --> 00:32:32,353
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

373
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:34,423
- Darn it, you punk. - Please let me live.

374
00:32:35,552 --> 00:32:37,563
I really don't have any money.

375
00:32:37,792 --> 00:32:40,232
Even if you looked everywhere, I haven't got a penny.

376
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:41,792
I'm so sorry.

377
00:32:42,903 --> 00:32:44,563
Then you'll pay me back with your body.

378
00:32:44,702 --> 00:32:46,373
Let's see. Your heart.

379
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:49,002
Your liver. Okay?

380
00:32:49,942 --> 00:32:52,573
And if we took your eyeballs, that might just cover the interest.

381
00:32:53,442 --> 00:32:56,683
The interest will snowball as the days go by. You got that?

382
00:32:56,843 --> 00:32:59,452
- I'm sorry. - Do you understand?

383
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,653
- Make sure you do your part. - I'm sorry.

384
00:33:05,353 --> 00:33:08,153
Where did you get the nerve to ignore my calls?

385
00:33:08,752 --> 00:33:11,363
Is he asking me to end his life or what?

386
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:14,393

388
00:33:43,663 --> 00:33:45,163

389
00:33:45,163 --> 00:33:46,962
What's today's date?

390
00:33:49,502 --> 00:33:51,863
- Are you kidding me? - Are you living...

391
00:33:52,772 --> 00:33:53,873
in August right now?

392
00:33:53,873 --> 00:33:56,002
Look at your calendar. Why are you asking me?

393
00:33:56,002 --> 00:33:57,073
Is it August?

394
00:33:57,073 --> 00:33:59,343
It's Thursday, August 13, 2020.

395
00:34:00,143 --> 00:34:01,313
Happy now?

396
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:05,012
Wait! Wait, don't hang up. Please don't do that.

397
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,583
I might sound like a lunatic,

398
00:34:12,382 --> 00:34:14,253
but please save my wife and my daughter.

399
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:16,963
You're the only one who can do that.

400
00:34:19,833 --> 00:34:21,132

401

I mean it. It's September here.

403

Hey.

404
00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:38,713
My life is already as difficult as it can be.

405
00:34:39,413 --> 00:34:41,253
You really need to stop this, okay?

406
00:34:41,253 --> 00:34:44,083
Please trust me. I live in your future right now.

407
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:45,722

You must be doing a lot of work while Director Kim is away.

437

I'm just doing my job. I'll do everything to make sure...

everything flows smoothly once he returns from his break.

439
00:38:04,807 --> 00:38:07,517
Good. Everything we do is done by people.

440
00:38:08,378 --> 00:38:11,748
His well-being is more important than how long he'll be off work.

We need to let the man live first, of course.

All right. Keep up the good work.

You activated this number, right?

Yes, is there a problem?

447

Hey, Geon Wook.

454
00:39:58,827 --> 00:40:01,157
Does Ms. Han Ae Ri live here?

455
00:40:02,327 --> 00:40:04,498
- She doesn't live here. - Excuse me.

456
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:06,837
Have you been living here for a long time?

457
00:40:07,337 --> 00:40:09,938
No, I moved in a month ago.

458
00:40:10,568 --> 00:40:12,238
Could it be the former tenant?

459
00:40:12,393 --> 00:40:13,823
Was her name Han Ae Ri?

460
00:40:14,123 --> 00:40:16,063
I'm not sure,

461
00:40:16,323 --> 00:40:18,193
but I heard she lived here for a long time.

462
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,464
She went to the school over there.

463
00:40:21,734 --> 00:40:24,104
School? I see.

464
00:40:25,734 --> 00:40:26,974
Hey, Ae Ri.

465
00:40:28,034 --> 00:40:32,003
Well... I think we can find your mom.

466
00:40:34,614 --> 00:40:35,614
Really?

467
00:40:35,914 --> 00:40:36,943
Yes.

468
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:39,484
I didn't tell you sooner...

469
00:40:39,484 --> 00:40:41,854
because I was unsure and didn't want you to have false hope.

470
00:40:43,123 --> 00:40:44,224
But I'm positive.

471
00:40:44,883 --> 00:40:46,554
How? Tell me right now.

472
00:40:49,563 --> 00:40:53,393
I know a friend from work who's extremely tech-savvy.

473
00:40:53,734 --> 00:40:55,864
He can get into any website.

474
00:40:56,433 --> 00:40:58,433
I asked him if he could hack into the health insurance site,

475
00:40:58,433 --> 00:40:59,734
and he said yes.

476
00:41:20,087 --> 00:41:21,816
I heard you're looking for Han Ae Ri, our former student.

477
00:41:23,024 --> 00:41:25,534
I'm sorry, but where are you from again?

478
00:41:26,094 --> 00:41:27,094

I was her homeroom teacher, but I'm not sure...

482
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:36,503
if she's still using this number.

(Han Ae Ri)

484
00:41:40,844 --> 00:41:43,114
This number didn't work.

485
00:41:43,114 --> 00:41:45,114
Is there any other way I could reach her?

486
00:41:47,284 --> 00:41:49,354
She had a close friend,

487
00:41:49,753 --> 00:41:51,984
but I'm not sure if they're still in touch.

488
00:41:51,984 --> 00:41:54,294

Hey, what happened to your face?

493
00:42:18,143 --> 00:42:20,484
It's nothing. I fell off the bike.

494
00:42:20,484 --> 00:42:22,114
You should've been more careful.

495
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:24,424
Did you bring them?

496
00:42:26,323 --> 00:42:29,594
Are you sure? Can he really find my mom?

497
00:42:29,893 --> 00:42:33,393
If she visited another hospital, he can find out which one it was.

498
00:42:33,393 --> 00:42:35,534
If he's lucky, he could even find out where she's staying.

499
00:42:36,063 --> 00:42:38,364
She needs to go to a hospital for her medication anyway.

500
00:42:39,703 --> 00:42:40,873
You're sure, right?

501
00:42:41,404 --> 00:42:43,443
He can find her hospital records, right?

502
00:42:44,503 --> 00:42:46,614
If he finds the name of the hospital she visited,

503
00:42:46,844 --> 00:42:48,743
could he also find out where she is right now?

504
00:42:49,383 --> 00:42:50,914
He'll try his best.

505
00:42:52,083 --> 00:42:53,583
Give me them.

00:42:55,253 --> 00:42:56,753

00:45:30,103 --> 00:45:31,603
I'm going to kill you.

538
00:45:38,914 --> 00:45:40,313
I've filed your report.

539
00:45:40,514 --> 00:45:43,083
We'll call you after he's up for wanted.

540
00:45:48,453 --> 00:45:49,524
Will I be able...

541
00:45:50,624 --> 00:45:52,063
to get the money back?

542
00:45:54,593 --> 00:45:58,004
Well... There's no guarantee.

543
00:47:34,994 --> 00:47:38,333
(Winning numbers for the 2nd week of August)

544
00:47:38,933 --> 00:47:41,274
I'm currently living a month ahead of you.

545
00:47:44,174 --> 00:47:45,744
(My Daughter)

546
00:47:45,744 --> 00:47:47,144
These are the winning numbers for the week's lottery.

547
00:47:47,213 --> 00:47:51,343
1, 28, 35, 41, 43, and 44.

548
00:48:01,294 --> 00:48:04,264
The person you have reached is unavailable.

549
00:48:04,563 --> 00:48:06,963
Please leave a message after the tone.

550
00:48:11,733 --> 00:48:12,733
Hey!

551
00:48:15,073 --> 00:48:16,244
Are you serious?

552
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:19,544
Are you really from the future?

553
00:48:20,343 --> 00:48:21,674
After her disappearance on the ninth,

554
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:24,284
part of Kim's body was sent to her family.

555
00:48:24,384 --> 00:48:27,113
Meanwhile, the police believe that it's highly likely...

556
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:28,613
that she is dead...

557
00:48:28,853 --> 00:48:30,483
and are having trouble with the investigation.

558
00:48:30,953 --> 00:48:32,953
The deliveryman, who was the key suspect,

559
00:48:32,953 --> 00:48:34,624
and the kidnapper's DNA was not...

560
00:48:39,494 --> 00:48:41,794
(Lottery winning numbers, Han Ae Ri...)

561
00:48:55,014 --> 00:48:57,813
If you're really from the future, please help me.

562
00:48:57,813 --> 00:48:59,884
My mom is very ill and needs surgery.

563
00:48:59,884 --> 00:49:02,183
But she disappeared, and my friend ran away with the money.

564
00:49:02,183 --> 00:49:04,054
His name is Im Geon Wook born on October 23, 1995.

565
00:49:04,054 --> 00:49:06,093
Please find this scumbag who ran away...

566
00:49:06,093 --> 00:49:07,853
with my mom's hospital money. Please help me find my mom.

567
00:49:07,853 --> 00:49:09,693
First voicemail.

568
00:49:10,093 --> 00:49:13,863
Hey! Are you really from the future?

569
00:49:15,593 --> 00:49:17,134
If you are,

570
00:49:18,463 --> 00:49:19,874
please...

571
00:49:20,534 --> 00:49:22,644
find my mom!

572
00:49:23,244 --> 00:49:25,644
Please find my money!

573
00:49:26,174 --> 00:49:27,473
Then I'll believe you.

574
00:49:28,544 --> 00:49:31,144
I'll believe that you're from the future.

575
00:49:45,624 --> 00:49:46,664
Hello?

576
00:49:47,193 --> 00:49:49,433
This is Kim Seo Jin. I got your voicemail.

577
00:49:49,863 --> 00:49:52,504
First, we should find that guy, Im Geon Wook.

578
00:49:53,134 --> 00:49:55,534
Did he steal your mom's hospital money?

579
00:49:56,904 --> 00:49:58,804
I had saved up that money for the past five years...

580
00:50:00,014 --> 00:50:01,343
and lost it in just five minutes.

581
00:50:01,573 --> 00:50:02,644
I see.

582
00:50:04,244 --> 00:50:05,914
I'll find him at all costs.

583
00:50:06,554 --> 00:50:07,583
Your mother too.

584
00:50:07,884 --> 00:50:10,284
If you do, I'll believe you.

585
00:50:12,953 --> 00:50:14,994
That you live in the future.

586
00:50:17,463 --> 00:50:19,124
And your request.

587
00:50:26,274 --> 00:50:29,304
Your call cannot be connected. You'll be redirected to voice mail.

588
00:50:29,343 --> 00:50:31,703
Your call will be charged after the beep.

589
00:50:32,374 --> 00:50:34,244
(Call ended)

590
00:50:53,294 --> 00:50:56,664
(Ministry of Justice)

591
00:51:13,353 --> 00:51:15,054
How did she get in here?

592
00:51:15,213 --> 00:51:17,353
- Can't you see the yellow tag? - What?

593
00:51:17,583 --> 00:51:19,083
It's a murder. She's a murderer.

594
00:51:19,083 --> 00:51:20,723
My goodness. Crazy witch.

595
00:51:21,193 --> 00:51:23,223
Who did she kill? Her husband?

596
00:51:23,794 --> 00:51:25,664
It was either the man who killed her mom...

597
00:51:25,664 --> 00:51:27,534
or she stabbed someone for money.

598
00:51:27,534 --> 00:51:31,534
Anyway, don't get near a murderer.

599
00:52:09,304 --> 00:52:10,674
We got the arrest...

600
00:52:10,674 --> 00:52:12,404
and sent the delivery guy to the detention center.

601
00:52:13,644 --> 00:52:16,884
But we don't know who gave him the parcel.

602
00:52:18,744 --> 00:52:19,913
I know it's frustrating,

603
00:52:20,913 --> 00:52:23,623
but we are doing our best.

604
00:52:25,823 --> 00:52:28,923
I have a favour.

605
00:52:35,264 --> 00:52:37,464
About Im Geon Wook's whereabouts you asked.

606
00:52:38,534 --> 00:52:40,934
You should go to Jungdong Prison.

607
00:52:40,934 --> 00:52:43,444
(Jungdong Prison)

608
00:52:43,573 --> 00:52:45,843
(Meeting Room)

609
00:53:08,034 --> 00:53:11,063
The meeting time is from 30 minutes to an hour.

610
00:53:24,843 --> 00:53:26,044
We finally met.

611
00:53:28,184 --> 00:53:29,524
Who are you?

612
00:53:35,153 --> 00:53:36,563
19 years ago,

613
00:53:38,163 --> 00:53:41,163
I almost got killed.

614
00:53:43,534 --> 00:53:45,264
Luckily, I survived,

615
00:53:45,903 --> 00:53:47,373
but I also lost a lot of things.

616
00:53:48,534 --> 00:53:50,504
What's already happened can't be undone.

617
00:53:52,804 --> 00:53:54,244
That's what I thought.

618
00:53:55,313 --> 00:53:56,544
I had to think that way...

619
00:53:58,413 --> 00:53:59,954
to endure it.

620
00:54:01,254 --> 00:54:02,284
But...

621
00:54:04,554 --> 00:54:06,024
I was wrong.

622
00:54:10,363 --> 00:54:11,494
It can be undone.

623
00:54:12,423 --> 00:54:14,194
You are going to save my life,

624
00:54:15,893 --> 00:54:17,534
and I'm going to save yours.

625
00:54:25,673 --> 00:54:26,944
(Han Ae Ri)

626
00:54:30,113 --> 00:54:31,913
- Hello? - Han Ae Ri.

627
00:54:32,444 --> 00:54:34,613
I've found that man.

628
00:54:35,184 --> 00:54:36,524
Where is that punk now?

629
00:54:36,754 --> 00:54:39,484
Before I tell you, promise me one thing.

630
00:55:19,363 --> 00:55:20,563
I found Im Geon Wook.

631
00:55:21,034 --> 00:55:22,833
My friends saw him at an internet café in Changam-dong.

632
00:55:26,264 --> 00:55:29,843
Hello? What's that reaction? Are you listening?

633
00:55:31,343 --> 00:55:32,573
I already knew.

634
00:55:33,143 --> 00:55:35,214
What? Who told you?

635
00:55:35,944 --> 00:55:37,184
I'll tell you later.

636
00:55:53,764 --> 00:55:58,063
(My Daughter)

637
00:56:03,843 --> 00:56:06,544
On the night of August 17, you and Im Geon Wook...

638
00:56:07,143 --> 00:56:08,744
will meet in Changam-dong.

639
00:56:10,343 --> 00:56:11,484
And you will kill him...

640
00:56:13,153 --> 00:56:15,383
by negligence.

641
00:56:20,353 --> 00:56:21,853
In the world I live in, a month later,

642
00:56:21,853 --> 00:56:23,423
you are imprisoned.

643
00:56:23,823 --> 00:56:26,734
Don't do anything stupid.

644
00:56:27,294 --> 00:56:28,593
I'll get your money back too.

645
00:56:30,163 --> 00:56:31,204
Are you listening?

646
00:56:31,734 --> 00:56:32,804
I...

647
00:56:35,734 --> 00:56:37,044
commit murder?

648
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:42,343
(Cheonha Internet Café)

649
00:56:52,353 --> 00:56:53,353
Im Geon Wook.

650
00:57:12,573 --> 00:57:13,613
You jerk.

651
00:57:14,974 --> 00:57:17,014
Stop right there.

652
00:57:17,244 --> 00:57:18,284
Hey!

653
00:57:19,413 --> 00:57:21,954
You jerk. Stop!

654
00:57:22,514 --> 00:57:23,784
Im Geon Wook!

655
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:26,754
You punk!

656
00:57:50,684 --> 00:57:52,143
Seriously!

657
00:57:57,984 --> 00:57:59,054
Your money...

658
00:57:59,754 --> 00:58:01,623
I'll pay it all back!

659
00:58:06,423 --> 00:58:07,534
Go.

660
00:58:08,563 --> 00:58:12,133
Please. Just go already!

661
00:58:26,813 --> 00:58:27,883
Hey.

662
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:31,583
Don't get near me.

663
00:58:32,554 --> 00:58:35,353
Han Ae Ri. Wait.

664
00:58:36,524 --> 00:58:37,794
Don't come closer.

665
00:58:39,363 --> 00:58:42,133
Ae Ri. The knife.

666
00:58:43,504 --> 00:58:45,034
Put that knife down.

667
00:58:46,063 --> 00:58:48,373
What are you going to do with that knife?

668
00:58:49,774 --> 00:58:50,774
Ae Ri.

669
00:58:59,014 --> 00:59:01,054
You were supposed to be killed by me today.

670
00:59:02,714 --> 00:59:04,484
I stab you with this knife,

671
00:59:05,224 --> 00:59:06,923
and you strike me with a rock.

672
00:59:09,554 --> 00:59:11,593
You were supposed to be killed by this knife.

673
00:59:11,593 --> 00:59:14,833
But I'm going to let you go.

674
00:59:14,934 --> 00:59:16,393
Because I have to meet my mom.

675
00:59:17,534 --> 00:59:20,304
If I kill you and go to prison, I can't meet my mom!

676
00:59:26,774 --> 00:59:27,813
Gosh.

677
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:36,454
Hey. I...

678
00:59:38,323 --> 00:59:40,254
I had no other choice.

679
00:59:41,724 --> 00:59:43,964
You know what that money meant to me.

680
00:59:44,464 --> 00:59:46,524
How can you do this to me?

681
00:59:51,163 --> 00:59:52,804
No matter what happens...

682
00:59:56,333 --> 00:59:58,843
No matter what happens, I'm going to get my money back from you.

683
01:00:20,393 --> 01:00:21,393
Ae Ri!

684
01:00:24,004 --> 01:00:25,163
I'm sorry.

685
01:00:25,633 --> 01:00:27,934
I'm sorry.

686
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:34,143
I'm requesting a visit.

687
01:00:43,724 --> 01:00:45,454
Please double-check the inmate's name.

688
01:00:48,054 --> 01:00:50,323
"Han Ae Ri" is correct.

689
01:00:53,434 --> 01:00:55,063
Ms. Han Ae Ri.

690
01:00:59,163 --> 01:01:00,534
There's no one by that name.

691
01:01:02,173 --> 01:01:04,073
I can't find her on the discharge list either.

692
01:01:05,274 --> 01:01:06,813
She's never entered this prison.

693
01:01:08,643 --> 01:01:10,913
I'm sorry, but I think there's been a misunderstanding.

694
01:01:13,954 --> 01:01:15,784
It changed. I did it.

695
01:01:29,294 --> 01:01:30,403
I can save them.

696
01:01:46,643 --> 01:01:51,583
(Kim Ji Soo)

697
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:52,583
Ji Soo.

698
01:01:53,554 --> 01:01:55,024
Are you not in pain anymore?

699
01:01:56,554 --> 01:01:57,593
I will punish...

700
01:01:59,163 --> 01:02:01,764
whoever hurt you.

701
01:02:03,333 --> 01:02:04,363
I promise.

702
01:02:13,873 --> 01:02:14,944
Hello?

703
01:02:15,044 --> 01:02:16,073
Ms. Han.

704
01:02:18,284 --> 01:02:20,353
Thanks to you, I found him.

705
01:02:20,714 --> 01:02:22,784
I know. Good job.

706
01:02:23,653 --> 01:02:24,684
You held yourself back.

707
01:02:25,323 --> 01:02:26,653
How do you know that?

708
01:02:27,423 --> 01:02:28,923
I already told you that I was from the future.

709
01:02:29,923 --> 01:02:31,163
Now it's your turn to help me.

710
01:02:36,563 --> 01:02:37,863
But to be frank,

711
01:02:39,133 --> 01:02:40,403
I'm not too sure.

712
01:02:42,173 --> 01:02:44,843
I'm not 100-percent sure for now.

713
01:02:47,544 --> 01:02:50,284
I'm going to send you a text right now.

714
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:52,643
Consider it as a down payment.

715
01:02:53,454 --> 01:02:56,853
(Lottery, 2nd week of August)

716
01:02:59,754 --> 01:03:00,853
These are the winning numbers...

717
01:03:00,853 --> 01:03:02,393
for the 1st lottery on the 3rd week of August.

718
01:03:02,454 --> 01:03:04,794
Did you say you lost 30,000 dollars?

719
01:03:06,363 --> 01:03:08,264
Will you trust me this time?

720
01:03:14,633 --> 01:03:16,234
I'd like to buy a lottery ticket.

721
01:03:24,343 --> 01:03:29,054
(August 19 lottery)

722
01:03:29,054 --> 01:03:31,184
(925th winning numbers)

723
01:03:31,184 --> 01:03:32,284
Four.

724
01:03:35,054 --> 01:03:36,294
14.

725
01:03:39,663 --> 01:03:41,534
23, 35, 37.

726
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:52,044
I got second place.

727
01:03:52,044 --> 01:03:55,244
(Reward)

728
01:03:55,244 --> 01:03:56,514
40,000 dollars.

729
01:04:02,514 --> 01:04:03,823
Mr. Kim.

730
01:04:06,554 --> 01:04:07,893
What do you need me to do?

731
01:04:08,754 --> 01:04:09,823
Let's do this.

732
01:04:10,024 --> 01:04:11,363
We can only talk...

733
01:04:11,623 --> 01:04:14,093
from 10:33pm to 10:34pm.

734
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:15,663
It's just one minute.

735
01:04:15,994 --> 01:04:18,163
I'll text you in advance if needed.

736
01:04:18,633 --> 01:04:21,274
First, we need to meet.

737
01:04:25,044 --> 01:04:26,804
I'm working at the headquarters of Yoojoong Constructions...

738
01:04:26,804 --> 01:04:27,944
in Joongang-Gu.

739
01:04:28,073 --> 01:04:30,383
I'm usually in the office in the afternoon.

740
01:04:30,984 --> 01:04:33,913
Please come and ask for me.

741
01:04:34,613 --> 01:04:37,054
My office is on the 12th floor.

742
01:04:37,054 --> 01:04:39,254
(Yoojoong Constructions)

743
01:04:40,823 --> 01:04:42,494
This is our family photo.

744
01:04:42,593 --> 01:04:45,163
It's a recent one, so you'll recognize me for sure.

745
01:04:45,724 --> 01:04:48,333
Meanwhile, I'll meet you in this world as well.

746
01:04:51,034 --> 01:04:53,163
Since the past has changed a month ago,

747
01:04:53,163 --> 01:04:56,504
you may now know where your mother is. Or...

748
01:04:57,373 --> 01:04:59,103
Perhaps, you two may be living together.

749
01:05:02,474 --> 01:05:05,843
Sir, I'm certain he's our guy. My gut feelings are screaming at me.

750
01:05:05,883 --> 01:05:08,754
You can't even see what he's wearing.

751
01:05:09,313 --> 01:05:11,823
That won't do. Look for others.

752
01:05:12,554 --> 01:05:16,323
He's the only one who brought a parcel to that site. It's him.

753
01:05:16,323 --> 01:05:18,264
- Fine. Let's say it's him. - Okay.

754
01:05:18,663 --> 01:05:19,823
Then how are we to catch him?

755
01:05:20,123 --> 01:05:22,734
How can we find him based on this photo of his back?

756
01:05:22,994 --> 01:05:24,103
Sir, take a look at this.

757
01:05:24,563 --> 01:05:27,633
Doesn't he have a peculiar gait? He has an out-toed gait.

758
01:05:27,934 --> 01:05:30,903
He's right. He has bow legs and it's an antalgic gait.

759
01:05:30,903 --> 01:05:33,843
Not many people walk like this.

760
01:05:34,444 --> 01:05:36,714
If we find people with this gait, we'll be able to close in on them.

761
01:05:36,714 --> 01:05:37,843
You fools.

762
01:05:38,244 --> 01:05:41,353
So where in the world can we find those who walk like this?

763
01:05:42,913 --> 01:05:45,254
Gosh, what a headache. Keep looking!

764
01:06:12,784 --> 01:06:14,014
How may we help you?

765
01:06:21,024 --> 01:06:23,254
I kidnapped Kim Da Bin!

766
01:06:23,623 --> 01:06:27,363
I kidnapped Kim Da Bin!

767
01:06:27,694 --> 01:06:28,964
I...

768
01:06:34,274 --> 01:06:37,103
- Cuff him. - Search him!

769
01:06:39,343 --> 01:06:41,214
Kim Seo Jin killed my kid.

770
01:06:41,873 --> 01:06:44,913
Because Kim Seo Jin killed my kid!

771
01:06:46,214 --> 01:06:48,413
I'd like to meet with Director Kim Seo Jin.

772
01:06:48,484 --> 01:06:50,823
I see. Have you made an appointment?

773
01:06:51,583 --> 01:06:54,353
No, but this is extremely urgent.

774
01:06:55,524 --> 01:06:57,524
I'll explain everything to him.

775
01:06:57,724 --> 01:07:00,494
If you haven't made an appointment, I'm afraid you can't enter.

776
01:07:01,194 --> 01:07:02,194
I'm sorry.

777
01:07:11,643 --> 01:07:12,774
(All employees are to wear their ID cards.)

778
01:07:12,774 --> 01:07:13,913
(Visitors are to hand in their ID cards at the reception.)

779
01:07:13,913 --> 01:07:15,474
The chairman is entering through the main entrance.

780
01:07:16,673 --> 01:07:18,044
We'll open the door.

781
01:07:23,923 --> 01:07:25,123
Mr. Kim.

782
01:07:57,083 --> 01:07:58,224
(Kairos)

783
01:07:58,224 --> 01:07:59,454
We've caught the culprit.

784
01:07:59,454 --> 01:08:01,893
Where is my daughter? Where is she? Tell me now!

785
01:08:01,994 --> 01:08:04,294
You don't know me, do you? Because I know you very well.

786
01:08:04,393 --> 01:08:06,724
In a few weeks, your daughter, Kim Da Bin,

787
01:08:06,724 --> 01:08:09,333
will be kidnapped and murdered.

788
01:08:09,434 --> 01:08:12,633
- Who are you? - You told me yourself.

789
01:08:13,133 --> 01:08:15,004
- Is it him? - Yes, it is.

790
01:08:15,004 --> 01:08:16,734
Didn't you say Kim Jin Ho wasn't an ex-convict?

791
01:08:16,734 --> 01:08:18,373
It's all fabricated.

792
01:08:18,373 --> 01:08:21,313
- Do you have proof? - How can I prove that?

793
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:23,714
If you're really the culprit, then this is only the beginning.

794
01:08:23,714 --> 01:08:25,383
I'm going to make sure that doesn't happen...

795
01:08:25,544 --> 01:08:26,613
at all costs.
