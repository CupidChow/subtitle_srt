I just keep getting thirsty.

- I missed you two too. - I missed you too.

16

What happened to Kim Jin Ho?

28
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,502
He killed himself.

29
00:03:35,202 --> 00:03:36,773
He came for the outpatient clinic,

30
00:03:36,903 --> 00:03:39,243
then threw himself off from the rooftop of the hospital.

31
00:03:40,243 --> 00:03:43,343

Ms. Han, have you found your mother?

70
00:07:37,982 --> 00:07:40,912
Yes, I met her today thanks to your help.

71
00:07:43,653 --> 00:07:45,953
I was arrested for murdering your mother,

72
00:07:46,523 --> 00:07:47,883
but the situation has changed.

73
00:07:48,523 --> 00:07:50,352
You saved me too, Ms. Han.

74
00:07:50,492 --> 00:07:53,062
Wait, then did Lee Taek Gyu blame what he did on you?

75
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,333
You have to catch him.

76
00:07:56,492 --> 00:07:58,862
If you don't, my mom will fall in danger again.

77
00:07:58,862 --> 00:08:01,833
Thankfully, the location tracker I put on him came back.

78
00:08:01,872 --> 00:08:04,203
I'll track him down right away if he does anything suspicious.

79
00:08:04,472 --> 00:08:05,903
Have you met with Kim Jin Ho?

80
00:08:06,672 --> 00:08:08,242
Did he say anything?

81
00:08:08,513 --> 00:08:09,573

To sum it up, after you found your mother,

84
00:08:17,982 --> 00:08:20,122
the only thing that changed is how Lee Taek Gyu didn't kill anyone.

85
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,422
Did your mother tell you about her relationship...

86
00:08:23,422 --> 00:08:24,622
with Yujung Constructions?

87
00:08:25,062 --> 00:08:27,823
No, not yet. She's very tired, so...

88
00:08:38,873 --> 00:08:40,542
Kim Jin Ho killed himself?

Yes.

139
00:12:37,177 --> 00:12:40,447
Your father had a sizeable land in the countryside.

140
00:12:40,976 --> 00:12:44,116
I didn't think anyone would buy it, so I didn't think much of it.

141
00:12:44,486 --> 00:12:46,687
But they were going to develop the area, so I sold it.

142
00:12:46,687 --> 00:12:47,817
That's where the money came from.

143
00:12:48,016 --> 00:12:49,626
If that wasn't dirty money,

144
00:12:49,927 --> 00:12:52,026
why did you suddenly disappear and hide?

145
00:12:52,126 --> 00:12:55,366
People always find out when you get a lot of money...

146
00:12:55,366 --> 00:12:58,896
and ask you for some. That's why I hid.

147
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:02,006
I was going to come back once the dust settled.

148
00:13:02,837 --> 00:13:04,136
I didn't tell you...

149
00:13:04,266 --> 00:13:07,106
because I was worried they'd pester you.

150
00:13:10,106 --> 00:13:12,276
Then why did Kim Jin Ho look for you?

151
00:13:13,776 --> 00:13:15,947
You disappeared out of the blue after meeting with him.

152

00:13:28,327 --> 00:13:30,766

158
00:13:38,837 --> 00:13:42,407
knew I had lost your dad during that accident and visited me.

159
00:13:43,177 --> 00:13:45,246
He said he was also in pain because of Yujung Constructions...

160
00:13:45,246 --> 00:13:46,476
and asked for my help.

161
00:13:47,976 --> 00:13:50,787
But there was nothing I could do to help.

162
00:13:55,187 --> 00:13:56,256
What about Lee Taek Gyu?

163
00:13:58,596 --> 00:13:59,996
What's your relationship with him?

164
00:14:00,557 --> 00:14:02,896
He was the one who had sent you that money.

165
00:14:03,396 --> 00:14:04,467
He works at Yujung Constructions.

166
00:14:04,467 --> 00:14:05,467
What?

167
00:14:06,567 --> 00:14:09,766
What are you saying? He must've had the same name.

168
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,907
Lee Taek Gyu is the name of the man who bought that land.

169
00:14:15,976 --> 00:14:17,846
Are you really telling me the truth?

170

00:16:51,366 --> 00:16:55,967
(Han Tae Gil, 41, male, Banyoung Constructions)

184
00:16:55,967 --> 00:16:57,337
I'm sorry, honey.

185
00:16:57,337 --> 00:16:59,876
(Han Tae Gil, 41, male, Banyoung Constructions)

186
00:17:00,037 --> 00:17:02,947
I'm sorry for coming so late.

187
00:17:10,687 --> 00:17:11,986
Are you okay?

188
00:17:14,516 --> 00:17:16,957
It's been 19 years.

189
00:17:20,197 --> 00:17:23,526
But it still feels like it was yesterday.

190
00:17:45,756 --> 00:17:47,857
I should've bought some flowers.

191
00:17:51,256 --> 00:17:53,957
There must be a flower shop nearby, right?

192
00:17:53,957 --> 00:17:56,367
Stay here. I'll be right back.

193
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:58,897
Will you?

194
00:17:59,266 --> 00:18:00,437
I won't take long.

195
00:18:23,357 --> 00:18:24,526
Hello.

196
00:18:26,457 --> 00:18:28,026
Do you sell condolence flowers?

197
00:18:39,776 --> 00:18:40,836
Mom.

198
00:18:44,177 --> 00:18:45,276
Mom.

199
00:18:47,677 --> 00:18:48,786
Mom?

200
00:18:59,496 --> 00:19:00,897
Don't look for me.

201
00:19:01,496 --> 00:19:04,097
That's the only way for us both to live.

202
00:19:04,867 --> 00:19:08,637
The quicker you forget about me, the safer I'll be.

203
00:19:09,336 --> 00:19:12,036
- Trust me when I say this. - Mom...

204
00:19:12,937 --> 00:19:15,036
Mom, my gosh.

205
00:19:16,677 --> 00:19:19,316
You'll end up dead at this rate.

206
00:19:32,097 --> 00:19:33,627
Relay my words loud and clear.

207
00:19:34,026 --> 00:19:37,427
If you wish to keep me from spilling what my husband knew...

208
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:39,167
about the accident involving Yujung Constructions,

209
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:41,796
you'll stay away from Ae Ri.

210
00:19:42,736 --> 00:19:46,177
Lay a hand on her,

211
00:19:46,437 --> 00:19:49,246
and I'll kill you all myself.

212
00:19:49,677 --> 00:19:51,276
Do you think I'm bluffing?

213
00:19:51,976 --> 00:19:53,576
I'm already dying anyway,

214
00:19:53,617 --> 00:19:55,986
so I can easily leave a few bodies in my wake.

215
00:19:59,056 --> 00:20:02,427
Once I know that my daughter is safe,

216
00:20:03,127 --> 00:20:06,496
I'll hand in everything I have.

217
00:20:07,026 --> 00:20:09,796
(Telecom)

218
00:20:13,867 --> 00:20:18,036
(Location trackers for kids)

219
00:20:24,046 --> 00:20:25,677
- Hey, Ae Ri. - Geon Wook, it's me.

220
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,917
Can you get me a taser gun?

221
00:20:28,417 --> 00:20:30,887
A taser gun? That's out of the blue.

222
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,286
I think I should have one for self-protection...

223
00:20:34,786 --> 00:20:36,657
and hand another to my mom.

224
00:20:36,927 --> 00:20:38,897
Are you home? Did your mom go out?

225
00:20:42,467 --> 00:20:44,097
Yes, I'm home...

226
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,137
and Mom's home too.

227
00:20:48,137 --> 00:20:51,066
Just for self-protection, right? I'll swing by with them later.

228
00:20:52,107 --> 00:20:53,806
No, I'll come and collect them.

229
00:21:06,117 --> 00:21:08,217
Where's Da Bin? Is she elsewhere?

230
00:21:08,756 --> 00:21:10,326
Taek Gyu took her.

231
00:21:10,756 --> 00:21:14,256
For Da Bin to follow Kim Jin Ho out on the day of the concert,

232
00:21:14,597 --> 00:21:16,597
she needs to be well-acquainted with him.

233
00:21:17,266 --> 00:21:19,367
He has a daughter her age,

234
00:21:19,437 --> 00:21:21,266
so he'll easily befriend her.

235
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:24,367
Are you sure Kim Jin Ho is on board?

236
00:21:24,736 --> 00:21:26,607
Can we safely leave her with him?

237
00:21:27,236 --> 00:21:29,776
Will Kim Jin Ho really do as we want?

238
00:21:31,147 --> 00:21:34,377
He believes that Seo Jin actually used illegal materials...

239
00:21:35,447 --> 00:21:37,947
and that it caused the death of his daughter.

240
00:21:38,617 --> 00:21:39,687
Also,

241
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,687
his second daughter is ill.

242
00:21:43,657 --> 00:21:45,496
I doubt he'll do anything stupid...

243
00:21:45,857 --> 00:21:47,256
when her life's on the line.

244
00:21:53,236 --> 00:21:54,336
All right.

245
00:21:55,167 --> 00:21:57,167
I'll trust you and believe it to be a safe plan.

246
00:21:58,536 --> 00:22:01,576
I'll soon have the passports ready, so consider that taken care of too.

247
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:07,877
Only one more thing remains.

248
00:22:36,576 --> 00:22:39,377
From there to here is the camera blind spot.

249
00:22:41,076 --> 00:22:44,347
Walk into it starting from that point...

250
00:22:47,016 --> 00:22:49,957
and leave a voice message to Seo Jin right there.

251
00:22:54,256 --> 00:22:55,766
I'm sorry for yelling at you.

252
00:22:55,766 --> 00:22:57,967
I can't take this anymore. Honey...

253
00:23:13,877 --> 00:23:16,447
I'll pick you up while you're still within the blind spot.

254
00:23:17,016 --> 00:23:18,957
I won't be caught on camera here?

255
00:23:20,187 --> 00:23:21,286
I'm sure of it.

256
00:23:32,026 --> 00:23:33,296
Can I use it right away?

257
00:23:33,397 --> 00:23:35,937
Yes, turn on the power and press that button.

258
00:23:36,967 --> 00:23:40,076
Be careful with it. The voltage on that is no joke.

259
00:23:40,937 --> 00:23:42,506
Sure. Catch you later.

260
00:23:44,207 --> 00:23:46,076
Did you take your mom to the hospital?

261
00:23:53,816 --> 00:23:55,086
I'm heading home right now.

262
00:23:56,086 --> 00:23:59,127
Da Bin went back to her mother after spending time with Kim Jin Ho.

263
00:24:00,427 --> 00:24:01,756
Yes, Mr. Seo.

264
00:25:32,887 --> 00:25:33,957
Let me go.

265
00:25:40,326 --> 00:25:41,357
Let go!

266
00:25:44,927 --> 00:25:46,197
What on earth are you doing?

267
00:25:46,536 --> 00:25:47,867
Do you have a death wish?

268
00:25:49,137 --> 00:25:50,937
If not, my mom will die.

269
00:25:51,867 --> 00:25:54,006
I have no choice but to kill him first.

270
00:25:54,877 --> 00:25:56,776
He must die for my mom to live.

271
00:25:57,947 --> 00:26:00,516
What? Where's your mom?

272
00:26:01,617 --> 00:26:03,286
Where is she right now?

273
00:26:09,957 --> 00:26:11,086
Geon Wook,

274
00:26:13,127 --> 00:26:14,496
I need your help.

275
00:26:20,066 --> 00:26:22,407
No, I won't help you.

276
00:26:25,236 --> 00:26:26,677
I can't anymore.

277
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:31,647
Not until you tell me everything you know.

278
00:26:37,046 --> 00:26:39,486
(Ae Ri, don't look for me.)

279
00:26:41,417 --> 00:26:44,457
Tell me again what's going on.

280
00:26:45,556 --> 00:26:46,597
When...

281
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:49,627
I lost my phone,

282
00:26:50,197 --> 00:26:52,766
I made contact with the one who found it.

283
00:26:54,437 --> 00:26:57,036
He's Kim Seo Jin...

284
00:27:00,377 --> 00:27:01,877
but from a month later.

285
00:27:02,947 --> 00:27:05,006
What? A month later?

286
00:27:05,847 --> 00:27:07,877
Today's date is August 30, right?

287
00:27:08,016 --> 00:27:09,986
The Kim Seo Jin I'm in contact with...

288
00:27:09,986 --> 00:27:11,516
lives in September 30.

289
00:27:11,816 --> 00:27:15,457
What? This isn't funny, you know.

290
00:27:16,786 --> 00:27:19,796
What's with the serious faces?

291
00:27:23,826 --> 00:27:26,496
Are you sick by any chance? Do you have a fever?

292
00:27:28,036 --> 00:27:29,766
This'll help you understand.

293
00:27:30,467 --> 00:27:33,107
Let me give you a massage. How about a glass of water?

294
00:27:33,107 --> 00:27:34,177
(Missing Child)

295
00:27:34,177 --> 00:27:35,336
(Kim Da Bin, 6)

296
00:27:35,336 --> 00:27:37,306
Why are you taking this seriously?

297
00:27:37,306 --> 00:27:38,377
(Missing Child, September 6, 2020)

298
00:27:40,976 --> 00:27:42,546
His daughter was kidnapped.

299
00:27:43,046 --> 00:27:44,347
I mean,

300
00:27:45,516 --> 00:27:47,117
she'll soon be kidnapped.

301
00:27:49,187 --> 00:27:50,486
Ms. Han?

302
00:27:50,927 --> 00:27:52,357
But then he said you were going to die.

303
00:27:52,357 --> 00:27:53,597
The place we're headed to...

304
00:27:54,197 --> 00:27:56,296
is where Mom will stay starting September 14.

305
00:27:56,627 --> 00:27:58,296
That's where I'll start backtracking her steps.

306
00:28:04,566 --> 00:28:06,976
What does he have to do with your mom's disappearance?

307
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:09,877
I don't know. Mom won't tell me the truth.

308
00:28:11,207 --> 00:28:14,076
So this Lee Taek Gyu will hurt your mom?

309
00:28:14,076 --> 00:28:15,417
What's up with you two?

310
00:28:15,417 --> 00:28:16,717
Exactly!

311
00:28:16,717 --> 00:28:20,056
It's why I should kill him before he gets to Mom.

312
00:28:20,187 --> 00:28:22,857
Are you saying you'd rather be a killer?

313
00:28:23,187 --> 00:28:24,826
Besides, who says he'll let you kill him?

314
00:28:24,826 --> 00:28:28,097
You'll only get hurt if you go after him.

315
00:28:28,097 --> 00:28:29,427
Then what option do I have?

316
00:28:29,427 --> 00:28:32,427
Darn it! We need a way to catch this scumbag.

317
00:28:33,597 --> 00:28:35,766
Guys, you're scaring me.

318
00:28:36,266 --> 00:28:37,867
Let's just look for Ae Ri's mom instead.

319
00:28:37,867 --> 00:28:40,377
We found her once, so we'll be able to do it again.

320
00:28:40,476 --> 00:28:42,806
Finding her will solve everything.

321
00:28:45,847 --> 00:28:48,276
But there's only one thing we could do at this point.

322
00:28:48,447 --> 00:28:50,986
We have to stop Lee Taek Gyu from doing what he did.

323
00:28:51,046 --> 00:28:52,286
We don't have any other options.

324
00:28:53,917 --> 00:28:57,357
Hey, how do you want us to help you? Tell me.

325
00:28:57,556 --> 00:29:00,597
Have you two gone insane? You're both crazy.

326
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:02,296
Hey.

327
00:29:07,296 --> 00:29:08,736
(My mom is gone again! Lee Taek Gyu... I'll kill that man!)

328
00:29:09,336 --> 00:29:10,937
My mom is gone again!

329
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:13,836
Lee Taek Gyu... I'll kill that man!

330
00:29:18,546 --> 00:29:19,546
Mr. Kim.

331
00:29:19,677 --> 00:29:21,776
Ms. Han, is everything all right?

332
00:29:22,377 --> 00:29:23,617
Did you really see Lee Taek Gyu?

333
00:29:24,016 --> 00:29:25,217
No.

334
00:29:26,117 --> 00:29:27,157
I'm so glad.

335
00:29:27,457 --> 00:29:29,627
You should never meet him whenever you're alone.

336
00:29:30,526 --> 00:29:33,957
Let's find your mother once again.

337
00:29:34,457 --> 00:29:35,826
I'm sure we'll be able to find him.

338
00:29:37,427 --> 00:29:38,897
I went to the hospital where Kim Jin Ho killed himself...

339
00:29:38,897 --> 00:29:40,367
and found out new information...

340
00:29:40,496 --> 00:29:44,207
Lee Taek Gyu was there at that hospital...

341
00:29:44,707 --> 00:29:46,006
when Kim Jin Ho died.

342
00:29:50,776 --> 00:29:52,647
There's only one thing I can do.

343
00:29:53,377 --> 00:29:54,447
What is it?

344
00:29:56,717 --> 00:29:58,246
We have to stop Da Bin's abduction.

345
00:30:00,157 --> 00:30:02,927
That's the only thing I could do over here.

346
00:30:04,026 --> 00:30:06,226
I'll make sure I stop Da Bin from getting abducted,

347
00:30:06,957 --> 00:30:09,967
then persuade Kim Jin Ho to get Lee Taek Gyu arrested.

348
00:30:11,127 --> 00:30:15,066
Please keep my mother safe over there, Mr. Kim.

349
00:30:17,367 --> 00:30:18,707
I'm sorry.

350
00:30:20,836 --> 00:30:21,836
And thank you.

351
00:30:23,006 --> 00:30:24,306
I'll make sure...

352
00:30:25,447 --> 00:30:27,576
I protect your mother no matter what happens.

353
00:30:38,457 --> 00:30:40,627
All right, we're going to begin treasure hunting.

354
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:43,927
- Okay. - Find the coloured paper we hid.

355
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:45,897
- Okay! - Don't go too far.

356
00:30:46,097 --> 00:30:48,236
- Ready, go! - Let's go!

357
00:30:48,236 --> 00:30:49,336
- Let's go. - Let's find it.

358
00:30:54,377 --> 00:30:56,707
- I found it! - I found it too.

359
00:30:57,107 --> 00:30:59,476
I found it!

360
00:30:59,476 --> 00:31:00,947
You found one?

361
00:31:10,256 --> 00:31:11,457
Ta-Da.

362
00:31:12,256 --> 00:31:13,627
Hello, lady.

363
00:31:14,927 --> 00:31:16,627
This is for you, Da Bin.

364
00:31:16,927 --> 00:31:18,826
Where did you find it?

365
00:31:19,566 --> 00:31:21,766
I can see all the treasure.

366
00:31:21,996 --> 00:31:23,536
Then can you find me another one?

367
00:31:24,266 --> 00:31:27,107
Then should we give the treasure to your stuffed doll too?

368
00:31:27,776 --> 00:31:28,836
I'll have that.

369
00:31:30,306 --> 00:31:33,246
Now, close your eyes, turn around, and count to 10.

370
00:31:33,776 --> 00:31:35,147
You have to keep your eyes closed.

371
00:31:36,917 --> 00:31:41,887
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

372
00:31:42,256 --> 00:31:47,457
6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

373
00:31:49,627 --> 00:31:51,197
We found another treasure!

374
00:31:53,097 --> 00:31:56,637
Da Bin, this treasure you got today is quite special.

375
00:31:57,207 --> 00:31:58,967
If you keep this doll with you,

376
00:31:59,407 --> 00:32:00,877
we can find you no matter where you are.

377
00:32:01,677 --> 00:32:04,276
You have to tell your dad about it.

378
00:32:04,607 --> 00:32:05,647
Okay?

379
00:32:12,816 --> 00:32:14,117
Dad!

380
00:32:16,927 --> 00:32:19,556
Some lady came today and gave this doll a treasure.

381
00:32:19,556 --> 00:32:21,996
If I keep this with me, I can always be found.

382
00:32:30,437 --> 00:32:32,137
Dad! I'm here!

383
00:32:32,137 --> 00:32:33,506
Hey, Da Bin.

384
00:32:35,207 --> 00:32:38,407
Dad, look at this. This doll is now very special.

385
00:32:38,907 --> 00:32:41,217
- Why is it special? - Some lady came today...

386
00:32:41,217 --> 00:32:42,816
and gave this doll a treasure.

387
00:32:43,117 --> 00:32:46,117
If I keep this with me, I can always be found.

388
00:32:46,117 --> 00:32:47,786
Is that so? One second.

389
00:32:48,617 --> 00:32:50,687
She told me to tell you about it.

390
00:32:50,687 --> 00:32:52,657
All right, I get it. One second.

391
00:32:59,197 --> 00:33:00,437
A location tracker?

392
00:33:06,437 --> 00:33:08,976
I put in a location tracker in Da Bin's stuffed teddy bear.

393
00:33:09,377 --> 00:33:12,847
If I can't stop her from getting abducted until the recital,

394
00:33:13,546 --> 00:33:15,347
I'll look at this to find her.

395
00:33:16,316 --> 00:33:18,286
The app can be installed on more than one phone.

396
00:33:18,986 --> 00:33:22,657
The locations are stored for about 10 days, so you can take a look.

397
00:33:23,756 --> 00:33:25,857
I'm sending you the app address and the registration number.

398
00:33:49,346 --> 00:33:53,545
The tracked vehicle has just left Yujung Constructions.

404
00:35:02,515 --> 00:35:04,785
I took care of Kim Jin Ho.

405
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:06,716
So why did you kill him?

406
00:35:09,226 --> 00:35:10,686
I told you to just make him scared.

407
00:35:10,856 --> 00:35:13,455
The investigation was concluded as suicide, so it'll be fine.

408
00:35:18,425 --> 00:35:19,866
Who are you to make decisions?

409
00:35:21,595 --> 00:35:23,466
My plan doesn't include murder.

410
00:35:27,936 --> 00:35:28,976
Do Kyun.

411
00:35:31,345 --> 00:35:32,776
Are you kidding me?

412
00:35:34,116 --> 00:35:35,545
What about my money?

413
00:35:39,955 --> 00:35:41,355
- What? - What if Kim Jin Ho...

414
00:35:41,355 --> 00:35:42,855
spills the truth to Kim Seo Jin?

415
00:35:45,486 --> 00:35:47,625
Kim Seo Jin's money isn't yours yet.

416
00:35:49,526 --> 00:35:51,665
I just need my money according to the contract.

417
00:35:58,635 --> 00:35:59,706
Taek Gyu.

418
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,945
Remember what that contract was about.

419
00:36:05,176 --> 00:36:07,216
If you don't stick to the contract, you won't get any money.

420
00:36:08,945 --> 00:36:11,086
Just do as I tell you, okay?

421
00:36:49,155 --> 00:36:50,655
Call me if something happens.

422
00:36:51,456 --> 00:36:52,625

Drive in the first lane from the right.

426
00:38:38,313 --> 00:38:39,354
Hello, Ms. Han.

427
00:38:41,084 --> 00:38:42,524
Did you read my texts?

428
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:45,654
I've put a tracker inside Da Bin's teddy bear.

429
00:38:46,094 --> 00:38:47,154
I know.

430
00:38:47,524 --> 00:38:50,863
I've obtained a new memory of her telling me about that teddy bear.

431
00:38:51,664 --> 00:38:54,034
If it's only been a month, I'm sure there's still battery life.

432
00:38:54,133 --> 00:38:55,493
Open it right now.

433
00:38:56,363 --> 00:38:58,204
There could be a record...

434
00:38:58,204 --> 00:38:59,474
of all the past locations where she's been.

435
00:38:59,673 --> 00:39:01,034
I'm connecting right now.

436
00:39:02,543 --> 00:39:05,574
While tailing Lee Taek Gyu today,

437
00:39:06,214 --> 00:39:07,914
I saw Seo Do Kyun with him.

438
00:39:09,284 --> 00:39:12,443
They were at that studio where you almost lost your life.

439
00:39:13,214 --> 00:39:15,214
Why were they there?

440
00:39:17,954 --> 00:39:19,324
Did you find any new information?

441
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:20,524
No, I haven't.

442
00:39:20,954 --> 00:39:23,524
I was chasing Mr. Seo up until a while ago when I lost him.

443

444
00:39:25,724 --> 00:39:28,363

447
00:39:36,443 --> 00:39:37,974
(The service is unavailable.)

448
00:39:44,584 --> 00:39:46,014
Should we just leave?

449
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:57,664
The passports are still valid.

450
00:40:04,503 --> 00:40:06,303
I haven't seen that face in a while.

451
00:40:09,803 --> 00:40:11,373
When I had left you back then,

452
00:40:13,274 --> 00:40:15,373
you had the same expression on your face.

453
00:40:27,394 --> 00:40:28,524
Give me a bit more time.

454
00:40:29,464 --> 00:40:30,964
I'll take care of everything.

455
00:40:34,363 --> 00:40:35,433
Are you worried?

456
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,803
Should I be?

457
00:40:37,563 --> 00:40:40,233
No. I'll take care of Kim Seo Jin first...

458
00:40:40,233 --> 00:40:42,373
I don't want to lose...

459
00:40:43,043 --> 00:40:45,173
any of the things I have.

460
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:52,383
Whether it be money, Da Bin,

461
00:40:58,883 --> 00:41:00,024
or you.

462
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:09,834
That was also something you promised me.

463
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:14,474
You can trust me.

464
00:41:43,863 --> 00:41:46,404
It's the first day of September, the start of the fall season.

465
00:41:46,673 --> 00:41:49,104
The sweltering heat has gone away,

466
00:41:49,104 --> 00:41:52,003
and September will be full of various cultural events.

467
00:41:52,873 --> 00:41:53,873
On September 6...

468
00:41:53,873 --> 00:41:56,414
at the grand ballroom of Saint Mayott Hotel,

469
00:41:56,414 --> 00:41:59,414
Yujung Constructions will be hosting a charity performance.

470
00:42:00,214 --> 00:42:02,053
Violinist Kang Hyun Chae...

471
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:04,854
and Pianist Ko Jeong Min will be performing.

472
00:42:05,824 --> 00:42:07,753
On the same day in Yangwon-Gu, Seoul,

473
00:42:07,753 --> 00:42:10,924
60 different dishes from all around the world...

474
00:42:14,993 --> 00:42:16,363
Are you having dinner at home tonight?

475
00:42:17,964 --> 00:42:19,033
I'm not sure. Why?

476
00:42:19,163 --> 00:42:20,704
The recital is around the corner.

477
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,233
I'll be coming home late after the practice.

478
00:42:23,844 --> 00:42:25,104
Then I'll take care...

479
00:42:26,413 --> 00:42:27,474
of dinner myself.

480
00:42:31,983 --> 00:42:33,413
- Bye. - Bye.

481
00:43:03,214 --> 00:43:06,513
I think I've given you enough time. Are you fully prepared?

482
00:43:48,294 --> 00:43:49,424
Let's meet first.

483
00:44:16,324 --> 00:44:17,684
You should hurry.

484
00:44:17,684 --> 00:44:20,393
(You should hurry.)

485
00:44:38,903 --> 00:44:40,613
We could've just told Mr. Lee to take care of it.

486
00:44:40,613 --> 00:44:42,314
Will you really be okay?

487
00:44:42,883 --> 00:44:45,143
I should be the one to choose my daughter's double.

488
00:45:11,444 --> 00:45:13,243
She has similar hair length.

489
00:45:15,674 --> 00:45:17,544
I'll take her hair today.

490
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:37,863
Get in.

491
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:40,403
Yes, sir.

492
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:47,714
Why did you come to work?

493
00:45:48,344 --> 00:45:49,474
You should rest more.

494
00:45:50,513 --> 00:45:52,243
I had some matters to take care of.

495
00:45:53,113 --> 00:45:56,424
I read about how that man committed suicide.

496
00:45:59,324 --> 00:46:02,123
All lives are important,

497
00:46:02,794 --> 00:46:05,023
but he reaped what he sowed.

498
00:46:05,794 --> 00:46:07,194
What goes around comes around.

499
00:46:08,363 --> 00:46:11,233
Everything will find its place,

500
00:46:12,033 --> 00:46:13,304
so hang in there.

501
00:46:14,903 --> 00:46:16,104
Yes, sir.

502
00:47:02,954 --> 00:47:05,224
Someone put a tracker on my car.

503
00:47:07,794 --> 00:47:09,253
Any guesses as to who put it there?

504
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:13,733
My guess would be Director Kim.

505
00:47:22,133 --> 00:47:24,344
We took my car when we went to see Kim Jin Ho.

506
00:47:25,174 --> 00:47:27,243
I'm not sure how he found a moment to attach it,

507
00:47:28,174 --> 00:47:30,044
but he must've been tracking me since that day.

508
00:47:32,184 --> 00:47:33,483
It's good to see you, Mr. Kim.

509
00:47:35,013 --> 00:47:36,253
What brings you by the office?

510
00:47:36,724 --> 00:47:38,253
I had business at HR.

511
00:47:38,554 --> 00:47:40,424
- Are you heading outside today? - No, sir.

512
00:47:41,354 --> 00:47:43,023
Then be at my office in 30 minutes.

513
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:44,794
Yes, sir.

514
00:48:04,483 --> 00:48:05,544

516

517
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:12,184
Yes, here you go.

518
00:48:12,184 --> 00:48:13,224

You see,

523
00:48:27,273 --> 00:48:29,403
it's hard to find the files on an employee...

524
00:48:29,403 --> 00:48:30,474
who's not in the database.

525
00:48:31,243 --> 00:48:33,773
Do you perhaps know his title or when he joined the company?

526
00:48:35,174 --> 00:48:38,314
Truth be told, he passed away in the Taejung Town incident.

527
00:48:38,883 --> 00:48:40,253
That's all I know about him.

528
00:48:40,253 --> 00:48:42,013
Oh, I see.

529
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,653

(Daeseung High School)

541
00:49:22,424 --> 00:49:23,924
Is there anything you need me to do?

542
00:49:24,763 --> 00:49:25,824
Have a seat.

543
00:49:30,564 --> 00:49:31,863
I'm grateful for you filling in for me.

544
00:49:32,403 --> 00:49:33,903
I hear you're down by the site often too.

545
00:49:34,533 --> 00:49:36,174
Oh, please. It's not a hassle.

546
00:49:37,044 --> 00:49:38,503
Did you go by the site too?

547
00:49:38,903 --> 00:49:40,243
According to your work schedule,

548
00:49:40,314 --> 00:49:42,773
you were at the site on the 29th with Taek Gyu.

549
00:49:42,974 --> 00:49:44,013
That's right.

550
00:49:45,743 --> 00:49:47,253
Not according to the people there though.

551
00:49:49,454 --> 00:49:50,454
Sorry?

552
00:49:51,954 --> 00:49:53,794
They say it was only you.

553
00:49:54,924 --> 00:49:55,993
Are they wrong?

554
00:49:59,834 --> 00:50:02,493
Let me apologize. I must've had it mixed up.

555
00:50:02,493 --> 00:50:04,464
Then where was Taek Gyu...

556
00:50:05,633 --> 00:50:06,804
on the morning of the 29th?

557
00:50:08,704 --> 00:50:10,503
To tell you the truth, I'm not sure.

558
00:50:10,743 --> 00:50:12,844
I didn't even know that that's what he wrote.

559
00:50:20,454 --> 00:50:21,854
Kim Jin Ho is dead.

560
00:50:26,354 --> 00:50:28,094
I read the article regarding his suicide.

561
00:50:28,094 --> 00:50:29,594
It wasn't suicide.

562
00:50:29,594 --> 00:50:31,493
He was murdered on the morning of the 29th.

563
00:50:33,934 --> 00:50:35,064
Are you sure?

564
00:50:38,203 --> 00:50:39,873
The day Kim Jin Ho died,

565
00:50:40,304 --> 00:50:43,544
didn't you two leave the office to head to the construction site?

566
00:50:43,604 --> 00:50:44,643
No.

567
00:50:45,804 --> 00:50:47,643
I don't know where he was that day.

568
00:50:48,443 --> 00:50:49,713
Why are you suddenly asking me about him?

569
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:52,014
Aren't I allowed to check up on my personal assistant?

570
00:50:52,413 --> 00:50:54,254
Do my questions bother you?

571
00:50:54,254 --> 00:50:55,984
No, of course not.

572
00:50:56,484 --> 00:50:59,524
It's just odd that you're asking about his whereabouts...

573
00:51:00,594 --> 00:51:01,893
on the day Kim Jin Ho died.

574
00:51:02,054 --> 00:51:03,723
Are you covering for him...

575
00:51:04,393 --> 00:51:05,494
because you come from the same hometown?

576
00:51:05,494 --> 00:51:06,534
I already told you...

577
00:51:07,234 --> 00:51:09,933
that I didn't know him prior to coming to work here.

578
00:51:14,274 --> 00:51:16,234
You don't know anything, is that it?

579
00:51:16,234 --> 00:51:17,943
That's right. I don't.

You never think you're wrong, do you?

584
00:51:47,304 --> 00:51:48,334
What do you mean by that?

585
00:51:48,334 --> 00:51:50,903
You've always had your way and failure is a foreign concept to you.

586
00:51:51,973 --> 00:51:54,713
I'm sure you don't care about other people's stories,

587
00:51:56,373 --> 00:51:58,014
but we're not failures...

588
00:51:58,014 --> 00:52:00,314
just because we don't meet your standards.

Life isn't easy for anyone, you know.

590
00:52:06,653 --> 00:52:08,054
I'm talking about Mr. Lee, sir.

591
00:52:09,223 --> 00:52:11,223
It's wrong to jump to conclusions about your subordinates.

592
00:52:25,774 --> 00:52:27,014
Are you sure it's about Taek Gyu?

593
00:52:27,814 --> 00:52:29,314
To me, it sounds biographical.

594
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:38,854
You're dismissed.

- Hello? - Mr. Kim,

596
00:52:55,534 --> 00:52:57,903
I have the test result regarding Da Bin's belongings.

597
00:53:00,413 --> 00:53:03,514
Did you find anything related to her stuffed animal?

598
00:53:03,584 --> 00:53:06,084
No, should I have found something?

599
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:08,854
No, forget I said anything.

600
00:53:09,554 --> 00:53:10,923
When can I come to collect it?

601
00:53:11,223 --> 00:53:12,883
Come by the station tomorrow

(State Exam Study Book)

603
00:53:39,613 --> 00:53:40,883
Do you need anything?

604
00:53:52,163 --> 00:53:53,534
That'll be 2.5 dollars.

605
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:15,054
There you go.

606
00:54:24,463 --> 00:54:25,663
I'm sure you remember me.

607
00:54:27,663 --> 00:54:29,264
You're Da Bin's mother.

608
00:54:34,834 --> 00:54:38,143
I'd appreciate it if you didn't easily mention my daughter's name.

609
00:54:43,413 --> 00:54:45,044
From what I understand,

610
00:54:45,044 --> 00:54:47,484
ex-cons can't apply for any state exam.

611
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:52,953
Being connected to us in some way...

612
00:54:52,953 --> 00:54:55,153
might seem like finding gold to you,

613
00:54:57,623 --> 00:54:59,064
but you should watch yourself.

614
00:54:59,223 --> 00:55:01,234
If you wish to keep what you have, of course.

615
00:55:09,133 --> 00:55:10,643
If you called yourself a mother,

616
00:55:11,173 --> 00:55:12,504
shouldn't you have heard me out...

617
00:55:12,504 --> 00:55:14,473
when I said that your child was in danger?

618
00:55:27,594 --> 00:55:28,653
You.

619
00:55:31,423 --> 00:55:34,163
What did I tell you about mentioning my daughter?

620
00:55:35,834 --> 00:55:38,564
Cross the line again and I'll take action too.

621
00:55:39,403 --> 00:55:40,604
Do you hear me?

622
00:55:48,844 --> 00:55:50,683
I feel bad for Mr. Kim.

623
00:55:55,883 --> 00:55:58,653
What did you just say?

624
00:55:59,153 --> 00:56:01,554
I don't know what family means to you,

625
00:56:02,254 --> 00:56:04,363
but he's doing everything possible to save his family...

626
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:06,794
even if it means losing all he has.

627
00:56:09,234 --> 00:56:11,863
Who's trying to save what?

628
00:56:11,903 --> 00:56:14,604
Even being accused of murder...

629
00:56:14,703 --> 00:56:17,703
hasn't stopped him from trying to save you and your daughter.

630
00:56:19,844 --> 00:56:22,544
Am I talking to a lunatic?

631
00:56:22,814 --> 00:56:25,314
You can think I'm crazy all you want.

632
00:56:26,113 --> 00:56:27,754
But at least notify the police...

633
00:56:29,613 --> 00:56:31,554
and protect your child that day.

634
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:45,534
Ms. Han,

635
00:56:46,663 --> 00:56:48,403
I doubt this'll get through your thick skull,

636
00:56:48,403 --> 00:56:50,034
but I'll say it anyway.

637
00:56:52,443 --> 00:56:53,443
Don't...

638
00:56:55,113 --> 00:56:57,143
take my warning lightly.

639
00:57:17,703 --> 00:57:18,734
Hello.

640
00:57:21,673 --> 00:57:23,104
Hey, what's wrong?

641
00:57:26,274 --> 00:57:27,274
It's nothing.

642
00:57:29,274 --> 00:57:31,344
Did you look into what I asked?

643
00:57:31,814 --> 00:57:33,284
Log in with this.

(ID: gw0407, Password: rjsdnrWkd!)

645
00:57:36,514 --> 00:57:38,554
I changed the registered name to me.

646
00:57:39,024 --> 00:57:40,123
Does it work?

647
00:57:40,354 --> 00:57:41,494
Yes.

648
00:57:41,854 --> 00:57:45,264
By the way, your ID worked. Why did you ask for a new one?

649
00:57:47,133 --> 00:57:50,734
It works for now. But after a month, it won't.

650
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:52,363
Why not?

651
00:57:52,633 --> 00:57:53,774
I'm not sure.

652
00:57:54,133 --> 00:57:57,643
It's not like I know everything that'll happen next month.

653
00:57:59,074 --> 00:58:00,844
Did Mr. Kim tell you anything else?

654
00:58:01,113 --> 00:58:04,084
No. He just said he couldn't log in.

655
00:58:05,544 --> 00:58:07,514
Hey, it works.

656
00:58:07,754 --> 00:58:08,854
You're right.

657
00:58:15,723 --> 00:58:16,794
Hello? Ms. Han.

658
00:58:17,294 --> 00:58:19,423
The teddy bear you inserted that tracker into...

659
00:58:19,423 --> 00:58:21,393
was the one she had on the day of her disappearance, right?

660
00:58:21,393 --> 00:58:22,594
The one she always carries around.

661
00:58:22,863 --> 00:58:24,564
Are you sure that was the right one?

662
00:58:24,564 --> 00:58:27,804
Yes, I'm sure. Just in case, I changed the registered name.

663
00:58:28,203 --> 00:58:29,873
Did you get the new ID and password?

664
00:58:33,344 --> 00:58:35,814
Okay, let me log in again.

665
00:58:36,744 --> 00:58:37,913
(Han Ae Ri: This is the ID and password.)

666
00:58:37,913 --> 00:58:41,854
I'll check the teddy bear myself tomorrow.

667
00:58:42,354 --> 00:58:46,054
But the police said they found nothing inside.

668
00:58:46,183 --> 00:58:47,294
That can't be.

669
00:58:48,094 --> 00:58:49,324
Then...

670
00:58:50,324 --> 00:58:52,264

You said there was nothing in the teddy bear, right?

678
00:59:22,393 --> 00:59:23,453
Yes.

679
00:59:24,024 --> 00:59:26,594
Should there have been something inside?

680
00:59:27,234 --> 00:59:28,933
Where are Da Bin's belongings right now?

681
00:59:29,234 --> 00:59:31,264
They're back at the station. I just checked before leaving.

682
00:59:32,004 --> 00:59:33,133
I'll go there right now.

683
00:59:33,433 --> 00:59:34,734
Mr. Kim...

684
00:59:37,673 --> 00:59:39,403
Okay. I'll see you at the station.

685
00:59:58,794 --> 01:00:00,163
It must've been extremely tough.

686
01:00:02,534 --> 01:00:04,633
I know it's hard not to go insane...

01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:06,334

Excuse me. I'm looking for a child.

Is your child missing? What's your room number?

696
01:02:02,453 --> 01:02:05,683
She's a six-year-old girl. Have you seen her around here?

697
01:02:05,854 --> 01:02:06,953
Her name is Kim Da Bin.

698

I'm sorry, but we don't include children's names in our name list.

01:05:44,643 --> 01:05:46,774
Goodness.

Let's eat.

712

Kim Jin Ho probably kidnapped Da Bin in the hallway...

713
01:07:36,383 --> 01:07:38,223
and took her to his car, so this would be the exit.

714
01:07:38,784 --> 01:07:41,953
You'll follow Da Bin from the event hall...

715
01:07:42,123 --> 01:07:43,354
and you'll stay in the lobby.

716
01:07:44,524 --> 01:07:45,993
I'll trail Kim Jin Ho.

717
01:07:47,593 --> 01:07:49,493
Do you mean we should split apart?

718
01:07:50,904 --> 01:07:52,703

I doubt there will be any blind spots.

720
01:07:58,373 --> 01:08:01,174
Ae Ri, I'm scared.

721
01:08:02,413 --> 01:08:04,314
Must we go this far?

722
01:08:07,584 --> 01:08:09,013
She's all we have.

723
01:08:09,484 --> 01:08:12,723
It's up to us to prevent this kidnapping.

(Soo Jung, Kitchen)

725
01:08:26,163 --> 01:08:27,203
(Soo Jung, Kitchen)

726
01:08:27,573 --> 01:08:29,604
(Concert Hall)

727
01:08:47,723 --> 01:08:52,694
(Kairos)

728
01:08:52,823 --> 01:08:56,393
(Kairos)

729
01:09:04,703 --> 01:09:07,473
(Kairos)

730
01:09:07,473 --> 01:09:08,714
I told you to be patient.

731
01:09:08,714 --> 01:09:10,873
I've been patient for over 20 years.

732
01:09:10,873 --> 01:09:12,114
I'm ready to give it all up.

733
01:09:12,114 --> 01:09:14,553
Hyun Chae, I will keep every promise I made to you.

734
01:09:14,584 --> 01:09:17,513
I don't care what happens to me. Just make sure you keep your word.

735
01:09:17,513 --> 01:09:18,754
They're entering right now.

736
01:09:18,754 --> 01:09:20,424
This isn't because I believe you two.

737
01:09:20,424 --> 01:09:22,493
Just make sure you get the job done.

738
01:09:22,524 --> 01:09:23,823
Is Da Bin here?

739
01:09:23,893 --> 01:09:24,893
Yes, Da Bin's here.

740
01:09:24,893 --> 01:09:26,294
Why don't we have some fun later?

741
01:09:26,294 --> 01:09:28,064
Where's my stuffed animal?

742
01:09:28,064 --> 01:09:29,864
He's here! Kim Jin Ho is entering the building.

743
01:09:29,864 --> 01:09:31,404
Ms. Han? Why are you here?

744
01:09:31,404 --> 01:09:32,734
It's Section 5-B.

745
01:09:32,803 --> 01:09:34,933
Please be okay, Mr. Kim.

746
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:37,873
Everything will change tomorrow. I'm sure of it.

747
01:09:37,873 --> 01:09:38,973
Da Bin!
