1
00:00:09,303 --> 00:00:12,874
I think it's time to make the decision.

2
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:14,383
Ms. Han.

3
00:00:16,213 --> 00:00:17,484
Listen to me carefully.

4
00:00:18,813 --> 00:00:19,914
Hello?

5
00:00:19,984 --> 00:00:22,723
I just got off the phone with you from a month from now.

6
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:25,824
He suggested this and I approved.

7
00:00:26,353 --> 00:00:27,524
Go ahead.

8
00:00:27,664 --> 00:00:30,623
Tomorrow, you from a month ahead...

9
00:00:30,623 --> 00:00:32,063
will meet Chairman Yu.

10
00:00:32,234 --> 00:00:34,964
And he'll make him spill the truth...

11
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:36,703
in his own words.

12
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:39,733
That's too dangerous. Chairman Yu won't let him live.

13
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:40,903
That's exactly what he's after.

14
00:00:41,843 --> 00:00:44,973
This is our one final chance.

15
00:00:48,343 --> 00:00:50,884
And everything you just said has been recorded.

16
00:00:51,453 --> 00:00:53,314
This will be enough proof.

17
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:55,854
You've done the exact same thing your father did.

18
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,953
Then I'll kill you the exact same way as well.

19
00:01:04,834 --> 00:01:07,903
Ms. Han, please take care of it.

20
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:11,604
You.

21
00:01:28,024 --> 00:01:30,824
Let's check and see if the recording went well.

22
00:01:34,824 --> 00:01:38,563
(Call recording, Kim Seo Jin)

23
00:01:40,664 --> 00:01:43,063
I'm asking as a victim of the Taejung Town Collapse.

24
00:01:43,434 --> 00:01:44,834
Did you intentionally blast...

25
00:01:44,834 --> 00:01:46,934
Taejung Town?

26
00:01:47,304 --> 00:01:49,474
Yes, I did.

27
00:01:50,104 --> 00:01:52,613
I blasted Taejung Town.

28
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:56,283
You fabricated the situation. You blamed the collapse on Banyoung.

29
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,783
You took over Banyoung.

30
00:01:57,854 --> 00:02:00,354
What's so bad about that?

31
00:02:00,483 --> 00:02:02,854
Why is it a sin...

32
00:02:02,983 --> 00:02:06,854
for the strong to consume the weak and survive?

33
00:02:10,963 --> 00:02:13,634
I'll take this to the prosecution tomorrow.

34
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,164
And I'll let the media cover this.

35
00:02:15,404 --> 00:02:17,134
How are you going to explain the source?

36
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:20,574
Mr. Kim of this recording is dead.

37
00:02:20,634 --> 00:02:22,303
What will you say to the prosecution...

38
00:02:22,303 --> 00:02:25,374
when you prove how you got your hands on this recording?

39
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:28,143
What else can I do?

40
00:02:28,344 --> 00:02:30,914
I have to get him arrested within a month,

41
00:02:30,914 --> 00:02:32,013
before the day of my death.

42
00:02:32,013 --> 00:02:35,724
This is our final chance.

43
00:02:35,824 --> 00:02:37,453
We can't lose this.

44
00:02:37,694 --> 00:02:39,053
You and I...

45
00:02:40,224 --> 00:02:43,863
You from a month ahead and I have shared many signs,

46
00:02:44,363 --> 00:02:46,134
but not everything we did was a success.

47
00:02:47,064 --> 00:02:50,463
Every time the present changed, the future did as well.

48
00:02:51,074 --> 00:02:52,703
What we must do now is...

49
00:02:53,074 --> 00:02:55,143
turning this recording...

50
00:02:55,143 --> 00:02:57,273
into solid and valid evidence.

51
00:02:58,314 --> 00:03:03,143
(Kairos)

52
00:03:03,314 --> 00:03:05,213
Please get changed and come to the examination room.

53
00:03:05,453 --> 00:03:07,013
Okay. Thank you.

54
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:10,583
I can do this alone. Go home and get some rest.

55
00:03:11,094 --> 00:03:12,393
I'm coming with you.

56
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:14,993
The medical staff will do everything for me.

57
00:03:14,993 --> 00:03:16,863
You'll make me feel uncomfortable if you waited here.

58
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,194
Come back tomorrow. Go home and do your thing.

59
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,863
Okay, Mom. I'll be here tomorrow when you get examined.

60
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:34,273
According to this timetable,

61
00:03:35,243 --> 00:03:38,754
you'll get into the accident today.

62
00:03:39,884 --> 00:03:42,553
However, since Park Joo Young and Lee Taek Gyu are detained,

63
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:44,754
nothing will happen.

64
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:46,393
You'll be fine.

65
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,794
Yes, although I won't die,

66
00:03:50,393 --> 00:03:52,034
my mom will remember...

67
00:03:52,034 --> 00:03:54,604
talking to me from a month ago after confirming my death.

68
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:58,534
I'll repeat everything I'll do a month from now on...

69
00:03:59,074 --> 00:04:00,404
to prevent any major changes.

70
00:04:00,404 --> 00:04:03,874
Until we get Chairman Yu to come out to the place of his confession,

71
00:04:04,474 --> 00:04:06,314
there can be no variables.

72
00:04:06,314 --> 00:04:07,374
Of course.

73
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:55,193
Hello?

74
00:04:55,493 --> 00:04:56,964
I have one question.

75
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,764
How was Hyun Chae...

76
00:05:01,264 --> 00:05:02,733
after I died?

77
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:08,904
(October 2020)

78
00:05:08,904 --> 00:05:10,544
(Kim Seo Jin's death, Kim Seo Jin meets Mom...)

79
00:05:12,774 --> 00:05:15,743
You'll get into the accident today.

80
00:05:15,743 --> 00:05:17,743
Your mother will be hospitalized in a month,

81
00:05:17,743 --> 00:05:20,113
then the accident will break out when you're home alone.

82
00:05:20,214 --> 00:05:21,654
Make sure you avoid doing so.

83
00:05:27,753 --> 00:05:29,724
No, I'll be fine.

84
00:05:31,334 --> 00:05:32,863
Everything has changed.

85
00:05:58,354 --> 00:05:59,794
Why did you come without telling me?

86
00:05:59,794 --> 00:06:02,063
I heard your mom is at the hospital.

87
00:06:03,164 --> 00:06:05,094
Geon Wook said we should hang out.

88
00:06:05,863 --> 00:06:07,164
What is that?

89
00:06:08,264 --> 00:06:10,303
I'm curious as well. What's in here?

90
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:19,613
What are you doing with this?

91
00:06:20,014 --> 00:06:23,113
Only Ae Ri and her mom live here.

92
00:06:24,014 --> 00:06:26,613
Keep these here and use them if necessary.

93
00:06:27,214 --> 00:06:29,123
I'm famished. Should we order something?

94
00:06:29,123 --> 00:06:31,493
No, let me see what's in the fridge.

95
00:06:36,294 --> 00:06:38,363
Hey, is something wrong?

96
00:06:38,693 --> 00:06:39,794
What do you mean?

97
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,933
Mr. Kim called me.

98
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:45,834
He wanted us to keep you company today.

99
00:06:47,873 --> 00:06:50,373
Both Lee Taek Gyu and Park Joo Young are locked up.

100
00:06:51,243 --> 00:06:52,544
Don't worry.

101
00:06:55,844 --> 00:06:58,313
This is a baton, okay? And...

102
00:06:59,683 --> 00:07:01,623
A Taser. And...

103
00:07:02,053 --> 00:07:03,954
you can spray this on their face.

104
00:07:04,483 --> 00:07:05,524
Keep it with you.

105
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,794
Thanks.

106
00:07:11,534 --> 00:07:13,834
Hey, let's just order some chicken.

107
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:15,204
Okay.

108
00:07:16,104 --> 00:07:18,334
How about we watch movies all night long?

109
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:19,774
- Deal. - Deal.

110
00:07:39,394 --> 00:07:41,693
(Kim Seo Jin)

111
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:45,233
The phone is turned off.

112
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:47,164
You'll be redirected to voice mail.

113
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:48,503
Please leave a message after the tone.

114
00:07:53,034 --> 00:07:55,904
Ms. Han, please take care of it.

115
00:08:00,214 --> 00:08:01,344
What are you doing here by yourself?

116
00:08:03,613 --> 00:08:04,753
Nothing.

117
00:08:08,483 --> 00:08:11,454
Can you really not reach Mr. Kim who's in the future?

118
00:08:15,423 --> 00:08:18,764
Do you think we can save him?

119
00:08:23,034 --> 00:08:26,433
At first, I couldn't understand how someone could be...

120
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,673
so fearless and reckless.

121
00:08:29,803 --> 00:08:31,414
I was dumbfounded.

122
00:08:35,313 --> 00:08:38,083
But I would've made the same decision if I were him.

123
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:44,624
Do you think I'll succeed?

124
00:08:48,693 --> 00:08:49,894
You will.

125
00:08:52,034 --> 00:08:53,593
You've been doing well all along.

126
00:08:59,734 --> 00:09:00,874
Let's go inside.

127
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,414
(This is my decision.)

128
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:54,950
(This is my decision.)

129
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,420
This is my decision.

130
00:09:59,489 --> 00:10:02,359
I would've made the same decision...

131
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,029
even if I was put in the same situation...

132
00:10:06,359 --> 00:10:08,099
in the next life.

133
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,940
I'll take care of your problem.

134
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:14,139
What does he mean?

135
00:10:22,609 --> 00:10:24,680
The phone is turned off.

136
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,849
You'll be redirected to voice mail.

137
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,249
Your phone's off.

138
00:10:29,849 --> 00:10:31,389
Call me when you get this.

139
00:11:34,989 --> 00:11:36,119
Who is it?

140
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:39,190
Who?

141
00:12:39,749 --> 00:12:41,080
Mr. Lee.

142
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:44,050
Mr. Lee, are you in?

143
00:12:45,859 --> 00:12:47,720
Did he go somewhere?

144
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,109
There are dead bodies here!

145
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:22,330
He was Lee Byung Hak, 57 years old, and jobless.

146
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:24,859
He had lived at a facility for the homeless for a long time.

147
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,660
Then three years ago, he had moved to the very house...

148
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,029
where he was found dead.

149
00:13:29,229 --> 00:13:31,599
The other body was identified as Seo Do Kyun, 32 years old.

150
00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:33,800
He was a manager at Yujung Constructions.

151
00:13:34,869 --> 00:13:37,009
- Did you get the murder weapon? - Yes.

152
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:39,379
There were two knives.

153
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:41,749
Lee Byung Hak's stab wounds...

154
00:13:41,749 --> 00:13:44,109
match the knife Seo Do Kyun had brought with him.

155
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:47,019
Seo Do Kyun's stab wounds...

156
00:13:47,479 --> 00:13:49,820
match the knife at Lee Byung Hak's place.

157
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:51,450
What's the motive here?

158
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,119
What kind of relationship did they have?

159
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,590
We're trying to find out if they've contacted each other...

160
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,690
or had money-related issues.

161
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:00,060
Interrogate their families and those around them...

162
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,629
and find out the motive.

163
00:14:01,729 --> 00:14:03,430
- Yes, sir. - About Seo Do Kyun...

164
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:05,499
Isn't he the one we saw...

165
00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:07,099
when Kim Seo Jin's daughter was almost kidnapped?

166
00:14:07,099 --> 00:14:10,269
Yes. I couldn't believe it at first, so I checked multiple times.

167
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,680
Hello, Kim Seo Jin speaking.

168
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:21,450
Mr. Kim.

169
00:14:22,849 --> 00:14:25,090
Mr. Seo Do Kyun was found dead.

170
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,229
Sorry?

171
00:14:30,489 --> 00:14:32,960
When? Where?

172
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,529
We're currently looking into it.

173
00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:39,769
Do you know Mr. Seo's home address?

174
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,170
He didn't live at the address on his resident registration.

175
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,379
I'll look into it.

176
00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:49,310
Also, please swing by when you have time.

177
00:14:49,349 --> 00:14:51,979
I need to ask you a few things regarding him.

178
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:53,550
Okay.

179
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,930
- Yes? - It's time for your meeting, sir.

180
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,729
Okay.

181
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,200
- This is Mr. Seo? - No way.

182
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,840
It's true. That detective wanted to identify him.

183
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,820

187
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:42,670
and B, a 57-year-old man who always stayed home...

188
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,269
due to having suffered burns all over his body.

189

It's Seo Do Kyun, right?

199
00:16:41,489 --> 00:16:42,560
It is.

200
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,229
His death was supposed to happen on the 29th,

201
00:16:45,229 --> 00:16:46,300
not before that.

202
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,859

331

00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:40,420
- What is it? - The package you're after...

342
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,120
is in my possession.

how the Taejung Town collapse 19 years ago...

346
00:26:49,269 --> 00:26:52,130
wasn't an accident caused by miscalculation...

347
00:26:52,229 --> 00:26:55,200
but an intended crime on your part where you set explosives...

348
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,640
to go off which ended in countless lives lost.

349

I already know that you don't have it.

355
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:33,279
The chairman ordered you to trace the dead Seo Do Kyun's whereabouts.

356
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:41,380
It's me. I wanted to track this phone's location.

Here's the number.

358
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:46,759
Yes, she came by.

359
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:51,960
I confirmed that Seo Do Kyun met with Han Ae Ri.

360
00:27:51,989 --> 00:27:54,930
They got into a fight at the place where Kim left the package.

361

00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:02,339
I already confirmed that Kim Jin Ho picked it up...

364
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:06,279
when that girl named Han Ae Ri went there to get it.

365
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:09,079
You only have these pictures. No one has any idea...

366
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:12,819
where the package is before Kim Jin Ho wakes up.

367
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,650
Anything else to say?

368
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:21,890
Anyway, I'll take this as your letter of resignation.

369
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:24,729
Get out of here now!

370
00:28:37,239 --> 00:28:39,509
- Hello? - This is Kwak Song Ja.

371
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:42,339
I have that package.

372
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:47,220
I'm the one who gave it to Mr. Kim Jin Ho,

373
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,079
and I got it back from him too.

374
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:52,390
I started everything, so I'll end everything too.

375
00:28:59,829 --> 00:29:01,829
Do you expect me to believe it?

376
00:29:01,999 --> 00:29:03,900
I don't care even if you don't.

377
00:29:04,569 --> 00:29:08,299
I may have done this alone before, but not anymore.

378
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:13,339
I'll no longer run from you.

379
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:18,210
If you want to get it back, do as Mr. Kim Seo Jin says.

380
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,589
What do you want?

381
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,690
I'll set the place and time, then let you know.

382
00:29:31,059 --> 00:29:34,600
If you want to get it back, come to that place.

383
00:29:52,979 --> 00:29:55,890
(Chairman Yu)

384
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:01,660
- Hello? - Send me the time and place.

385
00:30:18,339 --> 00:30:21,410
- Hello? - Chairman Yu said he'll meet me.

386
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:25,279
I'll see him tonight at that place at the same time.

387
00:30:27,979 --> 00:30:29,420
Mr. Kim.

388
00:30:30,989 --> 00:30:32,249
What if...

389
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,319
What if...

390
00:30:37,489 --> 00:30:39,630
I fail to save you?

391
00:30:45,769 --> 00:30:47,499
Everything will be fine.

392
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,769
But if anything happens to me,

393
00:30:54,009 --> 00:30:56,710
there's this document Mr. Kim Jin Ho gave me before.

394
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:59,210
It's only partial,

395
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:03,190
But it should be enough to raise suspicion with the prosecution...

396
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:05,049
over Taejung Town's collapse.

397
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,059
After that, we'll have to let fate decide.

398
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,190
We really don't have another way out of this, do we?

399
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,970
It just feels too dangerous.

400
00:31:16,729 --> 00:31:19,130
Even if I didn't die tomorrow, everyone will die...

401
00:31:19,299 --> 00:31:20,799
if we fail to catch Chairman Yu.

402
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,640
Brace yourself.

403
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:25,539
Okay.

404
00:31:26,809 --> 00:31:28,380
I'll bring myself together.

405
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,079
You've done very well...

406
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,650
to this day.

407
00:31:43,729 --> 00:31:44,789
Thank you.

408
00:33:22,448 --> 00:33:24,989
Why did you want to meet at a place like this?

409
00:33:26,748 --> 00:33:28,889
Your eyesight fails with age,

410
00:33:30,418 --> 00:33:32,289
so it was difficult to climb up those stairs.

411
00:33:33,489 --> 00:33:36,659
This is where the celebration for the start of Taejung Project...

412
00:33:37,899 --> 00:33:39,469
will take place.

413
00:33:39,629 --> 00:33:42,699
I see. Is this the place?

414
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,049
Blowing up and demolishing this abandoned building...

415
00:33:52,049 --> 00:33:54,019
is going to be the highlight of that event.

416
00:33:54,019 --> 00:33:55,818
You picked the right building.

417
00:33:56,549 --> 00:33:58,089
Give me the package first.

418
00:34:07,498 --> 00:34:08,829
Give it to me.

419
00:34:14,799 --> 00:34:16,568
Give me back what's mine.

420
00:34:17,168 --> 00:34:18,239
I don't have it.

421
00:34:19,009 --> 00:34:21,208
- What did you say? - I never had it.

422
00:34:24,049 --> 00:34:26,409
Fine, do as you please.

423
00:34:27,478 --> 00:34:29,678
I can just kill them all.

424
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:07,588
- You two, go around. - Yes, sir.

425
00:35:07,919 --> 00:35:09,159
Detective Choi, follow me.

426
00:35:09,288 --> 00:35:11,558
- The rest of you, go right. - Yes, sir.

427
00:35:20,838 --> 00:35:22,999
Sir, you must leave. Let us escort you.

428
00:35:26,139 --> 00:35:27,208
Stop that!

429
00:35:32,648 --> 00:35:33,648
Let me go!

430
00:35:44,428 --> 00:35:45,928
This way, sir.

431
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:50,928
I'll escort you to the other side.

432
00:36:21,558 --> 00:36:22,558
Stop!

433
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:24,229
Stop!

434
00:36:24,569 --> 00:36:25,669
Detective Choi, go inside.

435
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:28,239
Detective Kang.

436
00:36:29,398 --> 00:36:30,669
Mr. Kim!

437
00:36:31,569 --> 00:36:32,609
Over here!

438
00:36:38,248 --> 00:36:40,748
- Mr. Kim, are you okay? - This way.

439
00:36:40,748 --> 00:36:41,849
Over here!

440
00:36:42,618 --> 00:36:44,019
- Over here! - Are you okay?

441
00:36:49,088 --> 00:36:50,829
Please come with me.

442
00:37:15,349 --> 00:37:17,949
(Prosecution Service)

443
00:37:31,799 --> 00:37:34,299
You're making a huge mistake.

444
00:37:35,138 --> 00:37:37,969
Bring me the chief prosecutor. I'll explain everything to him.

445
00:37:43,409 --> 00:37:45,849
I'm asking as a victim of the Taejung Town Collapse.

446
00:37:46,178 --> 00:37:47,818
Did you intentionally blast...

447
00:37:48,178 --> 00:37:50,219
Taejung Town?

448
00:37:51,089 --> 00:37:53,388
Yes, I did.

449
00:37:54,149 --> 00:37:56,518
I blasted Taejung Town!

450
00:37:58,188 --> 00:37:59,789
You fabricated the situation.

451
00:38:00,428 --> 00:38:04,229
You blamed the collapse on Banyoung. You took over Banyoung.

452
00:38:04,399 --> 00:38:06,368
What's so bad about that?

453
00:38:06,669 --> 00:38:10,539
Why is it a sin for the strong...

454
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:12,469
to consume the weak and survive?

455
00:38:12,469 --> 00:38:14,068
What is all this?

456
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:15,808
Don't you recognize your own voice?

457
00:38:16,138 --> 00:38:18,209
What are you trying to pull?

458
00:38:18,649 --> 00:38:20,248
We've already analyzed the voice recording.

459
00:38:20,578 --> 00:38:23,649
It's been confirmed that your voice and the voice in this recording...

460
00:38:23,649 --> 00:38:24,989
are a match.

461
00:38:24,989 --> 00:38:26,489
I've never said such things!

462
00:38:27,659 --> 00:38:29,289
Call my lawyer right now.

463
00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:33,289
Will just receiving first aid be enough?

464
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:37,128
Yes, it's bearable.

465
00:38:45,638 --> 00:38:47,739
How did it go? What did Chairman Yu say?

466
00:38:47,779 --> 00:38:49,539
Did he listen to the voice recording?

467
00:38:49,539 --> 00:38:51,479
He keeps denying that it was him.

468
00:38:51,678 --> 00:38:54,419
The analysis result is effective evidence.

469
00:38:54,419 --> 00:38:57,018
The prosecution will take it into serious consideration.

470
00:38:59,248 --> 00:39:01,018
You two should go home and rest.

471
00:39:01,018 --> 00:39:03,018
The prosecution will contact you if necessary.

472
00:39:05,789 --> 00:39:07,899
Mr. Park, thank you...

473
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,068
for everything you've done.

474
00:39:15,339 --> 00:39:16,638
Mr. Kim.

475
00:39:18,209 --> 00:39:19,938
I don't know why,

476
00:39:21,008 --> 00:39:22,479
but there were often times...

477
00:39:22,878 --> 00:39:25,149
when it felt like...

478
00:39:26,209 --> 00:39:28,279
we went through many events together.

479
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:37,089
You've truly been through...

480
00:39:38,058 --> 00:39:39,459
so much.

481
00:39:54,409 --> 00:39:55,938
Chairman Yu Seo Il from Yujung Constructions...

482
00:39:55,938 --> 00:39:57,479
has been indicted...

483
00:39:57,479 --> 00:40:00,209
for placing explosives that caused the Taejung Town Collapse.

484
00:40:00,709 --> 00:40:03,549
There were over 200 casualties on that day.

485
00:40:03,549 --> 00:40:05,448
The court considered the possibility of him fleeing...

486
00:40:05,448 --> 00:40:07,388
since the truth has been revealed.

487
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:26,868
We're going to defend you and say that there's a possibility...

488
00:40:26,969 --> 00:40:28,239
of the voice recording, which they're trying to use...

489
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:29,508
as crucial evidence, being fabricated.

490
00:40:29,508 --> 00:40:31,709
It's not a possibility! It has been fabricated!

491
00:40:32,109 --> 00:40:34,109
I've never said such words!

492
00:40:34,479 --> 00:40:36,779
The date of the recording was October 15.

493
00:40:36,979 --> 00:40:40,549
We're also going to submit proof that you weren't there that day.

494
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:42,959
We need to get rid of that file.

495
00:40:43,489 --> 00:40:44,489
Call him.

496
00:40:49,529 --> 00:40:52,568
Kill Kim Jin Ho.

497
00:40:53,068 --> 00:40:54,128
Yes, sir.

498
00:40:55,169 --> 00:40:57,438
What should I do with the file that's in his possession?

499
00:40:57,438 --> 00:41:00,039
If he's the only one who knows where it is,

500
00:41:00,909 --> 00:41:03,138
no one will be able to find it if he dies.

501
00:41:03,678 --> 00:41:05,209
- Kill him. - Yes, sir.

502
00:41:08,349 --> 00:41:10,078
Everything will get solved if they all die.

503
00:41:21,859 --> 00:41:23,229
Did the hospital call?

504
00:41:23,498 --> 00:41:25,399
Mr. Kim Jin Ho regained consciousness?

505
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:27,169
Yes, I just got the call. Let's go.

506
00:41:40,308 --> 00:41:42,078
They definitely said that he had opened his eyes.

507
00:41:44,489 --> 00:41:47,188
Mr. Kim, open your eyes.

508
00:41:47,919 --> 00:41:50,418
Do you remember where you placed the file?

509
00:41:52,258 --> 00:41:54,028
Please say something.

510
00:42:05,138 --> 00:42:06,569
Mr. Kim.

511
00:42:07,908 --> 00:42:09,579
Ji Ah is doing well.

512
00:42:11,209 --> 00:42:12,849
Chairman Yu has been arrested.

513
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:16,248
This is only the beginning,

514
00:42:16,548 --> 00:42:18,118
but we're going to fight until the end.

515
00:42:19,089 --> 00:42:22,719
I'm going to do my best so that Ji Ah will live...

516
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:24,528
in a different world...

517
00:42:25,929 --> 00:42:27,329
than the one you live in.

518
00:42:33,868 --> 00:42:34,998
Mr. Kim.

519
00:42:40,368 --> 00:42:41,878
Do you have something to say?

520
00:42:47,378 --> 00:42:49,679
Slowly. Speak slowly.

521
00:42:51,418 --> 00:42:52,618
Did you understand him?

522
00:42:55,788 --> 00:42:56,859
What did he say?

523
00:43:01,528 --> 00:43:02,658
What did he say?

524
00:43:03,329 --> 00:43:04,429
Call the police right now.

525
00:43:06,329 --> 00:43:07,398
Just die.

526
00:43:27,849 --> 00:43:28,959
You may be seated.

527
00:43:36,028 --> 00:43:38,069
We will begin the hearing...

528
00:43:38,268 --> 00:43:40,398
for Case 2020-G-9212...

529
00:43:40,528 --> 00:43:42,898
regarding Yu Seo Il, the defendant.

530
00:43:43,268 --> 00:43:45,069
Please state the case.

531
00:43:49,278 --> 00:43:53,148
On November 8, 2001, at 7:37am,

532
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:55,819
the defendant had placed explosives and deliberately blasted...

533
00:43:55,819 --> 00:43:58,989
Taejung Town, a new building that was being built.

534
00:43:59,288 --> 00:44:01,719
Due to his heinous deed,

535
00:44:01,719 --> 00:44:05,189
68 lives were lost, 3 went missing, and 132 were injured.

536
00:44:05,729 --> 00:44:09,398
Afterwards, he fabricated the reason for the collapse.

537
00:44:09,398 --> 00:44:11,569
He put the blame on Banyoung Constructions,

538
00:44:11,628 --> 00:44:13,768
another construction company that was working with them,

539
00:44:13,768 --> 00:44:15,239
and accused them of poor planning and construction.

540
00:44:15,469 --> 00:44:17,498
He then actively covered up his crimes.

541
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:23,579
The defence may add on.

542
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:26,748
The accused denies all charges...

543
00:44:27,008 --> 00:44:28,479
raised by the prosecution.

544
00:44:29,418 --> 00:44:32,989
The recording submitted by the prosecution was fabricated.

545
00:44:34,819 --> 00:44:35,959
On what grounds?

546
00:44:35,959 --> 00:44:39,229
The recording in which he confesses to his crimes...

547
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:42,859
is said to have been recorded on October 15.

548
00:44:43,829 --> 00:44:47,599
However, at the exact time on that very day,

549
00:44:47,969 --> 00:44:50,538
he never met with the other person in the recording...

550
00:44:51,469 --> 00:44:52,969
let alone talk to him.

551
00:44:53,638 --> 00:44:55,979
I turn in these facts as evidence.

552
00:45:06,089 --> 00:45:07,288
(Proof of Facts)

553
00:45:09,658 --> 00:45:11,258
Will you call upon a witness?

554
00:45:13,489 --> 00:45:15,459
Yes, the prosecution calls its witness.

555
00:46:06,179 --> 00:46:08,778
I submit the video file that contains Chairman Yu...

556
00:46:08,878 --> 00:46:11,748
confessing to his crimes 19 years ago to Kim Yoo Seok,

557
00:46:11,748 --> 00:46:15,158
one of the family members of the Taejung Town collapse victims.

558
00:46:34,778 --> 00:46:36,138
Are you all right?

559
00:46:50,489 --> 00:46:52,028
Lee Taek Gyu was just arrested.

560
00:46:53,288 --> 00:46:55,798
You're not in danger anymore, so be at ease.

561
00:46:58,229 --> 00:46:59,599
Get some rest then.

562
00:47:09,109 --> 00:47:10,339
Mr. Kim?

563
00:47:11,648 --> 00:47:13,349
The evidence...

564
00:47:14,878 --> 00:47:16,219
is with...

565
00:47:18,648 --> 00:47:20,589
Ji Soo's ashes.

566
00:47:23,788 --> 00:47:26,689
I'm asking as a victim of the Taejung Town Collapse.

567
00:47:27,788 --> 00:47:29,699
Did you intentionally blast...

568
00:47:30,099 --> 00:47:32,329
Taejung Town?

569
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:37,599
So what if I did?

570
00:47:38,309 --> 00:47:39,739
Answer me!

571
00:47:39,908 --> 00:47:42,239
Did you plan for Taejung Town to collapse?

572
00:47:42,579 --> 00:47:47,008
Yes, I did. It was my doing.

573
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:52,689
The useless would've died someday anyway.

574
00:47:53,219 --> 00:47:55,719
I just made sure they didn't die in vain.

575
00:47:55,918 --> 00:47:59,329
Then you fabricated the numbers and the documents...

576
00:47:59,628 --> 00:48:02,498
and blamed the collapse on Banyoung.

577
00:48:02,628 --> 00:48:04,699
You're going to take over Banyoung during this crisis...

578
00:48:04,699 --> 00:48:07,668
to make Yujung greater? Is that it?

579
00:48:07,868 --> 00:48:10,839
This Yujung that rises from the ashes...

580
00:48:11,298 --> 00:48:13,508
will feed more people...

581
00:48:13,908 --> 00:48:18,408
than the lives lost in that one incident.

582
00:48:19,648 --> 00:48:22,819
For those people, I'd gladly blast away...

583
00:48:23,118 --> 00:48:25,489
a few more buildings.

584
00:48:25,689 --> 00:48:27,548
So choose wisely.

585
00:48:27,748 --> 00:48:29,719
Fight against me to your death...

586
00:48:29,859 --> 00:48:33,089
or grovel at my feet to keep living.

587
00:48:37,329 --> 00:48:38,729
The accused Yu Seo Il...

588
00:48:38,898 --> 00:48:41,498
actively covered up his crimes...

589
00:48:41,498 --> 00:48:44,138
and has shown no remorse until now.

590
00:48:44,268 --> 00:48:47,439
He even threatened the lives of those trying to unveil the truth.

591
00:48:48,679 --> 00:48:51,309
To the accused who let his greed...

592
00:48:51,309 --> 00:48:53,648
cause an unforgivable crime,

593
00:48:53,908 --> 00:48:55,548
we ask for life imprisonment.

594
00:49:10,699 --> 00:49:13,429
(Seoul Western District Court)

595
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:14,998
Here he comes!

596
00:49:23,908 --> 00:49:26,548
You must think you came out ahead.

597
00:49:27,609 --> 00:49:30,278
But my life's work...

598
00:49:31,048 --> 00:49:33,819
will never be brought down by you.

599
00:49:34,189 --> 00:49:35,388
We'll see about that.

600
00:49:38,089 --> 00:49:40,258
- Any words? - Over here!

601
00:49:40,258 --> 00:49:42,128
- Do you still deny the charges? - Sir!

602
00:49:42,128 --> 00:49:44,229
Could you say a few words?

603
00:49:44,229 --> 00:49:46,268
Do you have any last words?

604
00:49:46,329 --> 00:49:48,298
- Over here. - Please say a few words.

605
00:49:48,298 --> 00:49:50,739
- Sir! - Will you appeal?

606
00:49:50,739 --> 00:49:52,739
- Please say a few words. - Over here, sir!

607
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:54,209
Just a few words.

608
00:50:03,248 --> 00:50:04,748
It was imperative that...

609
00:50:04,748 --> 00:50:07,219
we hid the fact that Mr. Kim Jin Ho was testifying.

610
00:50:07,648 --> 00:50:09,819
Thank you for keeping him safe.

611
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:12,158
Chairman Yu may appeal,

612
00:50:12,158 --> 00:50:14,388
but the evidence is too damning to change anything.

613
00:50:14,528 --> 00:50:16,158
I'll see you in a month at his ruling.

614
00:50:16,929 --> 00:50:18,998
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.

615
00:50:21,069 --> 00:50:24,298
I'm the one who should be grateful to you who guarded this evidence...

616
00:50:24,298 --> 00:50:27,838
and Mr. Kim Yoo Seok who gave his life for the truth.

617
00:50:29,278 --> 00:50:30,308
Right.

618
00:50:32,409 --> 00:50:34,848
Mr. Prosecutor, I have something to tell you...

619
00:50:35,149 --> 00:50:37,119
and will come by your office later.

620
00:50:37,449 --> 00:50:38,989
Sure thing. Then...

621
00:50:39,649 --> 00:50:41,518
- Thank you. - Thank you.

622
00:50:48,088 --> 00:50:49,498
What it is that you want to say?

623
00:50:50,929 --> 00:50:52,129
Da Bin...

624
00:50:53,598 --> 00:50:56,098
Her kidnapping was indeed planned.

625
00:50:57,838 --> 00:51:01,108
Seo Do Kyun, Kang Hyun Chae, Lee Taek Gyu,

626
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:04,379
and I. We were all in on it.

627
00:51:05,078 --> 00:51:07,409
All I did was voice my complaints to you...

628
00:51:08,449 --> 00:51:09,949
about being the victim,

629
00:51:10,879 --> 00:51:12,018
but...

630
00:51:13,088 --> 00:51:15,018
I realized that I never apologized.

631
00:51:16,288 --> 00:51:17,719
I'm truly sorry.

632
00:51:18,528 --> 00:51:21,998
I'll go to the prosecutor and tell him everything.

633
00:51:29,298 --> 00:51:31,639
I'll make sure to ask for leniency.

634
00:51:32,068 --> 00:51:33,409
Ji Ah's...

635
00:51:34,869 --> 00:51:36,508
been alone for too long.

636
00:51:38,949 --> 00:51:41,008
She misses her father a lot.

637
00:51:43,419 --> 00:51:44,979
Thank you so much.

638
00:52:17,979 --> 00:52:21,288
You and Seo Do Kyun planned to kidnap Kim Da Bin...

639
00:52:21,288 --> 00:52:23,889
and blackmailed Kim Seo Jin.

640
00:52:24,858 --> 00:52:26,788
Your accomplices Kim Jin Ho and Lee Taek Gyu...

641
00:52:26,788 --> 00:52:27,989
already confessed to the crime.

642
00:52:28,929 --> 00:52:32,298
Here are the call and text history from your phone.

643
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:34,199
Take a look at them.

644
00:52:42,108 --> 00:52:43,508
Let me ask you this one thing.

645
00:52:44,038 --> 00:52:47,149
Why go to all this trouble instead of just divorcing him?

646
00:52:47,848 --> 00:52:49,048
Was it because of the money?

647
00:53:17,139 --> 00:53:18,879
That you have no priors,

648
00:53:21,508 --> 00:53:23,048
that you admitted to the crime,

649
00:53:24,248 --> 00:53:26,189
and that the kidnapping fell through...

650
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:29,889
will be why you only receive probation.

651
00:53:32,258 --> 00:53:33,558
I'm taking custody of Da Bin.

652
00:53:35,229 --> 00:53:37,028
Let me know once you find a place to live...

653
00:53:39,028 --> 00:53:40,528
so that I can send you the divorce papers.

654
00:53:40,699 --> 00:53:41,838
It was all...

655
00:53:44,598 --> 00:53:46,268
because of my greed.

656
00:53:50,179 --> 00:53:51,639
You see,

657
00:53:53,248 --> 00:53:55,818
I was only there at the university to drop out.

658
00:54:09,858 --> 00:54:12,328

Part Two will start soon.

662
00:54:31,619 --> 00:54:33,219
Who's the next performer?

663
00:54:33,689 --> 00:54:35,318
- What's the order? - It's her,

664
00:54:35,318 --> 00:54:37,189
- Okay. - her,

665
00:54:37,389 --> 00:54:39,028
then the violinist.

666
00:54:39,028 --> 00:54:41,159
- Okay, please get them ready. - Okay.

667
00:54:50,439 --> 00:54:52,369
As I was getting sick and tired...

668
00:54:52,369 --> 00:54:54,639
of living with a poor guy,

669
00:54:55,278 --> 00:54:57,008
that's when you came into my life.

670
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:02,479
You looked like a saviour who'd help me retrieve everything...

671
00:55:02,778 --> 00:55:04,719
that I had lost.

672
00:55:09,018 --> 00:55:12,358
I tried so hard not to lose anything.

673
00:55:15,858 --> 00:55:17,358
But I lost everything...

674
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:20,869
that was dear to me.

675
00:55:20,929 --> 00:55:22,498
You have no right...

676
00:55:24,498 --> 00:55:26,439
to pity yourself.

677
00:55:28,008 --> 00:55:29,939
People who are in worse... No.

678
00:55:31,379 --> 00:55:32,748
Not everyone who's in the same situation as you...

679
00:55:32,748 --> 00:55:34,248
would make the same choices.

680
00:55:35,278 --> 00:55:37,518
You ruined yourself.

681
00:55:38,649 --> 00:55:39,949
Now,

682
00:55:42,459 --> 00:55:43,818
take responsibility.

683
00:56:07,748 --> 00:56:08,949
Dad.

684
00:56:13,818 --> 00:56:15,119
Do you remember this watch?

685
00:56:18,489 --> 00:56:20,189
Thanks to your gift,

686
00:56:20,189 --> 00:56:23,028
I was able to protect Mom alongside Mr. Kim's help.

687
00:56:26,369 --> 00:56:28,998
Now, I know that you've been listening to me...

688
00:56:29,338 --> 00:56:30,568
all along.

689
00:56:33,808 --> 00:56:36,209

I'm sorry for visiting you so late.

Thank you...

695
00:57:19,149 --> 00:57:20,449
for saving me.

Let's go have some pork belly and wine.

Where's Geon Wook?

701
00:59:12,469 --> 00:59:14,268
- He'll be here soon. - Okay.

702
00:59:14,568 --> 00:59:16,199
Where was the campsite again?

703
00:59:16,399 --> 00:59:17,969
How long will it take?

704
00:59:18,639 --> 00:59:20,608
Let me check Mr. Kim's text.

705
00:59:21,568 --> 00:59:23,038
- Should I carry your luggage? - It's okay.

706
00:59:23,179 --> 00:59:24,209
Hey, Geon Wook.

707
00:59:31,278 --> 00:59:34,119
Hey, what is this? Did you rent it?

708
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:37,788
- I did. - Where did you get the money?

709
00:59:38,219 --> 00:59:39,758
Why did you get such a nice car?

710
00:59:40,189 --> 00:59:41,729
Did you do something again?

711
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:44,098
Do you take me for a troublemaker?

712
00:59:44,358 --> 00:59:45,699
I also make money, you know?

713
00:59:46,129 --> 00:59:47,798
- Ma'am, get in. - Okay.

714
00:59:49,568 --> 00:59:52,538
Goodness, what a nice car.

715
00:59:52,969 --> 00:59:55,979
It's going to be a comfortable trip thanks to you.

716
00:59:56,308 --> 00:59:57,709
You should nap if you're tired.

717
00:59:57,709 --> 01:00:00,149
After charging the car, we'll get going.

718
01:00:00,348 --> 01:00:01,348
Get in.

719
01:00:16,729 --> 01:00:19,568
- Ma'am, I'll charge the car here. - Okay.

720
01:00:20,169 --> 01:00:21,498
Let me get some beverages.

721
01:00:21,828 --> 01:00:23,699
Let me stop by the restroom.

722
01:00:23,699 --> 01:00:24,699
Let me.

723
01:00:24,998 --> 01:00:27,308
- What do you want? - Anything.

724
01:00:27,308 --> 01:00:28,338
Okay.

725
01:00:53,729 --> 01:00:54,729
Hey.

726
01:00:55,098 --> 01:00:57,469
Be honest with me. What's going on?

727
01:00:58,268 --> 01:00:59,369
You didn't rent this, did you?

728
01:00:59,669 --> 01:01:00,709
Well...

729
01:01:02,068 --> 01:01:04,439
I bought it because it was too cold on the bike.

730
01:01:05,409 --> 01:01:06,409
What?

731
01:01:06,949 --> 01:01:08,449
Did you really cause trouble?

732
01:01:11,018 --> 01:01:13,949
Mr. Kim gave me...

733
01:01:15,619 --> 01:01:17,018
the winning lottery numbers once.

734
01:01:18,518 --> 01:01:19,588
Hey.

735
01:01:19,788 --> 01:01:21,788
Don't you know how dangerous it is to suddenly have a lot of money?

736
01:01:21,788 --> 01:01:23,498
I never asked him to do that.

737
01:01:23,758 --> 01:01:25,598
He offered first.

738
01:01:27,498 --> 01:01:28,798
Did you check your bank account?

739
01:01:29,899 --> 01:01:30,969
Why?

740
01:01:32,808 --> 01:01:35,108
I'm no longer indebted to you.

741
01:01:47,748 --> 01:01:50,159
Soo Jung, take this, will you?

742
01:01:50,189 --> 01:01:52,459
- Ma'am, give it to me. - Mom, I said I'd do it.

743
01:01:52,489 --> 01:01:55,058
- Come here. Go sit down. - Okay.

744
01:01:55,058 --> 01:01:56,129
Put that down.

745
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:59,629
- Okay, okay. Take this. - My gosh.

746
01:02:08,169 --> 01:02:10,008
1, 2, 3.

747
01:02:18,518 --> 01:02:19,689
What is that?

748
01:02:21,018 --> 01:02:22,149
Did you get a new phone?

749
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:24,318
She lost her old one.

750
01:02:24,518 --> 01:02:26,758
She couldn't even find it.

751
01:02:26,788 --> 01:02:28,288
She's obviously your friend.

752
01:02:28,288 --> 01:02:30,159
I was about to get a new one anyway.

753
01:02:31,959 --> 01:02:34,429
I've changed my number, so I'll give you the new one.

754
01:02:39,469 --> 01:02:42,209
I really wanted to go on a trip with you.

755
01:02:43,209 --> 01:02:44,409
My wish came true.

756
01:02:44,538 --> 01:02:45,709
Let's come here again.

757
01:02:45,979 --> 01:02:48,979
I'm going to get surgery and become healthy again.

758
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:53,889
I'm going to eat good, delicious food with you...

759
01:02:53,889 --> 01:02:55,919
and make many great memories together for a very long time.

760
01:02:57,058 --> 01:02:58,558
That's a promise.

761
01:02:58,659 --> 01:03:00,758
- Did the photo turn out right? - We look so cute.

762
01:03:01,229 --> 01:03:02,899
Do you think we're all living happily...

763
01:03:03,098 --> 01:03:04,699
in the future as well?

764
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:09,298
I'm sure all of us...

765
01:03:10,899 --> 01:03:12,338
are living happily.

766
01:03:14,268 --> 01:03:15,879
I believe so.

767
01:03:17,608 --> 01:03:19,078
I know we're happy there as well.

768
01:03:21,578 --> 01:03:22,578
All right.

769
01:03:23,048 --> 01:03:25,848
It's 10:33pm. Give him a call.

770
01:03:25,889 --> 01:03:26,949
That would be fun.

771
01:03:31,389 --> 01:03:35,929
(Kim Seo Jin)

772
01:03:35,929 --> 01:03:37,459
(Kim Seo Jin)

773
01:03:43,169 --> 01:03:44,998
Hello? Ms. Han.

774
01:03:45,699 --> 01:03:46,939
Mr. Kim.

775
01:03:52,979 --> 01:03:56,078
I guess my husband is finally at peace now.

776
01:04:07,558 --> 01:04:09,028
That startled me.

777
01:04:13,669 --> 01:04:14,828
Hello?

778
01:04:22,838 --> 01:04:24,679
You finally picked up.

779
01:04:25,139 --> 01:04:27,608
You found my phone, didn't you? I want it back.

780
01:04:27,608 --> 01:04:30,248
I didn't. You have the wrong number.

781
01:04:31,578 --> 01:04:32,919
Wrong number.

782
01:04:32,919 --> 01:04:34,889
- Gosh. - Don't mind it, guys.

783
01:04:35,989 --> 01:04:37,518
I nearly jumped in my seat.

784
01:04:38,818 --> 01:04:41,028
- I'll get us some more food. - Sure.

785
01:04:58,338 --> 01:05:01,308
What... I'm fine, you know.

786
01:05:02,308 --> 01:05:03,548
I'm not cold.

787
01:05:03,679 --> 01:05:04,818
As if.

788
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:07,518
You were sneezing, sniffing, and your nose is red.

789
01:05:07,889 --> 01:05:10,189
You're close to catching a cold, if you ask me.

790
01:05:10,919 --> 01:05:11,959
Here.

791
01:05:12,989 --> 01:05:15,858
You getting sick and suffering from it...

792
01:05:15,858 --> 01:05:17,229
will only annoy me,

793
01:05:18,298 --> 01:05:20,268
so take cold syrup before going to bed.

794
01:05:21,528 --> 01:05:23,768
I'm grateful for this, but I'm really all right.

795
01:05:24,369 --> 01:05:26,139
Tend to Soo Jung instead.

796
01:05:31,139 --> 01:05:33,248
- Ae Ri. - Yes?

797
01:05:34,879 --> 01:05:36,649
I'm only like this to you.

798
01:05:37,778 --> 01:05:39,518
Not others.

799
01:05:44,219 --> 01:05:45,689
Darn, you're dense.

800
01:05:46,288 --> 01:05:47,389
Give me that.

801
01:06:02,439 --> 01:06:03,939
What's that?

802
01:06:06,308 --> 01:06:09,078
- It's the Milky Way. - How pretty!

803
01:06:11,619 --> 01:06:14,119
Wait. Way over there.

804
01:06:14,949 --> 01:06:16,758
I see your constellation too.

805
01:06:16,889 --> 01:06:19,258
I want to see my star as well.

806
01:06:20,858 --> 01:06:22,088
Da Bin,

807
01:06:22,088 --> 01:06:26,098
the stars you're seeing right now exist years before this moment.

808
01:06:27,869 --> 01:06:29,699
They're so far away...

809
01:06:29,699 --> 01:06:32,199
that they take time to reach Earth, you see.

810
01:06:33,639 --> 01:06:35,608
That's too difficult for a kid to understand.

811
01:06:36,879 --> 01:06:38,838
Dad, what about the moon?

812
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:41,348
How long did that take to get here?

813
01:06:45,649 --> 01:06:49,219
The moon you're seeing right now is from a second in the past...

814
01:06:50,219 --> 01:06:53,058
and the sun is always eight minutes ahead of us.

815
01:06:53,389 --> 01:06:55,258
- Do you understand all that? - Yes.

816
01:06:56,028 --> 01:06:57,558
- Really? - Yes.

817
01:06:58,028 --> 01:07:00,929
Da Bin, come and get your marshmallow!

818
01:07:00,969 --> 01:07:02,429
- Okay. - Let's have marshmallows.

819
01:07:10,578 --> 01:07:12,778
If you think about it, it's quite fascinating.

820
01:07:14,048 --> 01:07:16,449
The fact that the stars...

821
01:07:16,748 --> 01:07:19,018
are actually from our past.

822
01:07:20,989 --> 01:07:23,088
The past and present are able to coexist.

823
01:07:23,088 --> 01:07:26,128
We of all people know that now.

824
01:07:27,289 --> 01:07:29,628
What would you wish for if you were to make contact...

825
01:07:30,898 --> 01:07:32,298
with the future again?

826
01:07:33,999 --> 01:07:35,628
I'm done with that kind of wishful thinking.

827
01:07:36,668 --> 01:07:38,338
I learned...

828
01:07:38,338 --> 01:07:41,039
that turning back time isn't the key that solves all.

829
01:07:42,508 --> 01:07:44,539
I now know that changing the past...

830
01:07:44,539 --> 01:07:46,679
has its consequences.

831
01:07:46,978 --> 01:07:48,409
What about you, Mr. Kim?

832
01:07:53,148 --> 01:07:54,289
I've...

833
01:07:56,358 --> 01:07:58,318
lived my life only going forward.

834
01:07:59,588 --> 01:08:01,228
Doing so...

835
01:08:02,588 --> 01:08:04,429
had me take for granted...

836
01:08:05,429 --> 01:08:06,929
those precious in my life.

837
01:08:08,499 --> 01:08:10,269
Then, we both...

838
01:08:10,938 --> 01:08:13,139
have no need to know what the future holds.

839
01:08:16,079 --> 01:08:18,179
I don't know what awaits me in the future,

840
01:08:18,739 --> 01:08:20,079
but I'm no longer afraid...

841
01:08:21,108 --> 01:08:22,449
of what's to come.

842
01:08:27,818 --> 01:08:29,588
It's a shooting star!

843
01:08:29,588 --> 01:08:31,059
- Where? - Where?

844
01:08:34,188 --> 01:08:36,798
- Let's all make a wish! - A wish!

845
01:08:40,369 --> 01:08:42,628
Mom, you should make a wish too.

846
01:08:43,239 --> 01:08:44,869
Everything I want came true.

847
01:08:47,608 --> 01:08:49,838
- Da Bin, what did you wish for? - It's a secret.

848
01:08:54,079 --> 01:08:55,608
I thought you didn't have any wishes.

849
01:08:56,878 --> 01:08:58,619
I only made one.

850
01:08:58,778 --> 01:08:59,989
Which is what?

851
01:09:02,889 --> 01:09:06,258
For the last few months, I spent my days...

852
01:09:06,429 --> 01:09:10,199
only waiting for the time to tell 10:33pm.

853
01:09:12,128 --> 01:09:13,199
So I wished...

854
01:09:14,228 --> 01:09:17,039
that I can cherish every minute of the day now.

855
01:09:38,659 --> 01:09:40,059
No way.

856
01:09:41,389 --> 01:09:42,628
The fried chicken is here.

857
01:09:43,528 --> 01:09:44,858
Finally.

858
01:09:44,999 --> 01:09:46,528
Ae Ri, the fried chicken is here.

859
01:09:46,769 --> 01:09:48,099
- Sure. - Get out here.

860
01:09:49,028 --> 01:09:50,469
I'm starving.

861
01:09:50,699 --> 01:09:51,769
I'll get the cups.

862
01:09:51,769 --> 01:09:52,969
Fried chicken!

863
01:09:53,269 --> 01:09:54,338
Thanks.

864
01:09:59,749 --> 01:10:00,909
Here.

865
01:10:01,409 --> 01:10:03,949
- You go ahead. - It's your favourite piece.

866
01:10:03,949 --> 01:10:05,249
No, it's not.

867
01:10:05,619 --> 01:10:07,289
I like drumsticks.

868
01:10:07,418 --> 01:10:09,449
- Not the breasts? - No.

869
01:10:09,449 --> 01:10:11,619
I can't believe you still don't know that.

870
01:10:11,889 --> 01:10:14,389
- Mom. - You go ahead.

871
01:10:14,389 --> 01:10:16,228
(10:33pm, December 22, Tuesday)

872
01:10:16,228 --> 01:10:17,358
You eat that.

873
01:10:17,429 --> 01:10:18,999
Miranda said,

874
01:10:19,499 --> 01:10:22,429
"Blue goes better with that hat."

875
01:10:23,369 --> 01:10:24,639
But her mom said,

876
01:10:25,099 --> 01:10:27,938
"Then we won't be able to return the hat."

877
01:10:28,469 --> 01:10:31,739
So Miranda and her mom...

878
01:10:31,739 --> 01:10:35,108
carefully washed the blue paint off the hat.

879
01:10:38,978 --> 01:10:41,148
Then they all smiled widely.

880
01:11:07,079 --> 01:11:13,449
(10:33pm, December 22, Tuesday)

881
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:20,559
(Kairos)

882
01:11:20,688 --> 01:11:24,329
(Kairos)

883
01:11:41,909 --> 01:11:42,978
(Special thanks to Sung Ji Ru and Choi Duk Moon)

884
01:11:45,918 --> 01:11:47,449
(Kairos)

885
01:11:47,449 --> 01:11:49,519
(Thank you for watching.)
