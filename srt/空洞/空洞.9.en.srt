Seo Jin, you should launch the Taejung New Town project.

Here are the related documents. Take a look.

00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,549
- Please give me time to consider. - There's nothing to consider.

4
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,849
This project will decide...

5
00:00:23,849 --> 00:00:26,119
Yujung's fate for the next decade.

6
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,959
I can't put anyone else in charge.

7
00:00:28,959 --> 00:00:30,330
You need to take it, Seo Jin.

8
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,229
You may go.

9
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,070
Yes, sir.

10
00:00:36,629 --> 00:00:40,000
Right, what happened to that incident?

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,369
Which incident, sir?

12
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,239
Was it an abduction attempt?

13
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,710
I mean, at the concert hall.

14
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,549
The police are under investigation.

15
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,150
What will you do about her?

16
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,650
I'm about to file a suit.

17
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,150
Drop the charge.

18
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:56,019
- Pardon? - If it was someone who's insane,

19
00:00:56,519 --> 00:00:58,659
nothing will happen to her even if you take it to court.

20
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,489
Show her mercy.

21
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:02,159
- But... - If you let this go on,

22
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:04,699
it'll take away your time, and people will keep talking.

23
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,199
I worked for many years for that charity concert.

24
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:11,540
I don't want people to think of that incident...

25
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,770

26

- You went through so much. - What happened?

Did that scumbag really drop the charges?

84
00:06:15,443 --> 00:06:16,673
I guess so.

85
00:06:18,113 --> 00:06:20,113
He seemed so coldhearted.

86
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,553

00:06:25,524 --> 00:06:27,923

89
00:06:28,594 --> 00:06:29,654
Just block him.

90
00:06:30,024 --> 00:06:32,664
Better yet, you should just change your number.

91
00:06:33,024 --> 00:06:34,164
Change it immediately.

92
00:06:34,764 --> 00:06:35,933

99
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,214

100

Do you have the case or the label?

120

No. A family member has been taking it in secret,

121
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:28,214
so I was concerned.

122
00:08:28,873 --> 00:08:30,673

143
00:09:42,953 --> 00:09:44,313
I took care of it already,

144
00:09:45,884 --> 00:09:47,024
so don't worry about it.

145
00:09:49,293 --> 00:09:50,293
Right.

00:09:58,764 --> 00:09:59,864
How did it end?

150
00:10:00,963 --> 00:10:02,473
I did as you told me to do.

151
00:10:03,173 --> 00:10:05,803
I explained to him clearly that he couldn't get...

152
00:10:06,274 --> 00:10:08,274
what he wanted without any proof and sent him back home.

153
00:10:08,443 --> 00:10:09,614
What did he want again?

154
00:10:11,343 --> 00:10:12,543
He wanted you, the person in charge,

155
00:10:13,543 --> 00:10:15,354
to acknowledge and apologize for the mistake.

156
00:10:15,683 --> 00:10:18,423
He also wanted to be compensated.

157
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:27,364

Are you sure she won't threaten you anymore?

161
00:10:40,374 --> 00:10:42,644
Well, I doubt anything would happen.

162
00:10:42,744 --> 00:10:43,843
She seemed crazy.

163
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,144
That's what concerns me more.

164
00:10:45,543 --> 00:10:46,614
Perhaps,

165
00:10:47,683 --> 00:10:49,654
has she ever contacted...

166
00:10:50,313 --> 00:10:51,823
or approached you?

167
00:10:52,354 --> 00:10:53,453
Not at all.

168
00:10:54,823 --> 00:10:56,394
She did come to my house once.

169
00:10:56,494 --> 00:10:58,193
Thanks to her, my wife was very shaken up.

170
00:11:01,593 --> 00:11:04,563
Don't worry too much. If she ever does this again,

171
00:11:04,634 --> 00:11:06,264
I won't show her any leniency.

172
00:11:06,904 --> 00:11:09,604
She was lucky that she got caught at an event hosted...

173
00:11:10,004 --> 00:11:11,374
by our company.

174
00:11:14,104 --> 00:11:15,144
Right.

178
00:11:45,443 --> 00:11:47,404

179
00:11:48,244 --> 00:11:50,744
- Da Bin's teddy bear. - What about it?

180
00:11:50,874 --> 00:11:52,443
I need to check if there's really a tracker in there.

181
00:11:53,414 --> 00:11:55,614
I need to know whether or not she's actually crazy...

182
00:11:55,884 --> 00:11:57,884
- in order to come up with a plan. - Just get rid of her.

183
00:12:00,823 --> 00:12:02,593
- What? - What's there to think about?

184
00:12:02,994 --> 00:12:04,254
Just kill her.

Hyun Chae, this isn't that simple.

186
00:12:08,933 --> 00:12:10,433
You shouldn't be so weak.

187
00:12:10,793 --> 00:12:13,063
Did you agree to do this in a wishy-washy state?

188
00:12:14,504 --> 00:12:15,673
Once this is all over,

189
00:12:15,673 --> 00:12:17,774
we'll be getting completely new identities.

190
00:12:18,073 --> 00:12:19,673
So what are you so afraid of?

191
00:12:26,043 --> 00:12:27,384
If that's not it,

192
00:12:29,854 --> 00:12:31,953
then you must not be as desperate as I am.

193
00:12:40,963 --> 00:12:41,963
I've dedicated...

194
00:12:46,063 --> 00:12:47,734
I've dedicated my entire life to you.

195
00:12:56,874 --> 00:12:58,183
Then prove it.

196
00:13:16,164 --> 00:13:17,364
Gosh, I'm so exhausted.

197
00:13:29,644 --> 00:13:30,813
Gosh, I'm so tired.

198
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,114
Did you wait long?

199
00:13:33,443 --> 00:13:36,154
I bought some good quality pork belly.

200
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:39,154
The queue was so long, but I managed to buy some.

201
00:13:39,923 --> 00:13:41,154
All right.

202
00:13:41,723 --> 00:13:44,394
Soju is a must when having pork belly.

203
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:47,423
Aren't you famished? It won't take long. Just wait.

204
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:49,034
I'm sick of this.

205
00:13:54,264 --> 00:13:55,374
What did you say?

206
00:14:00,004 --> 00:14:01,744
All these fake things you give me.

207
00:14:04,673 --> 00:14:07,443
Until when must I pretend that these are real?

208
00:14:10,553 --> 00:14:12,354
What's gotten into you?

209
00:14:14,124 --> 00:14:17,223
Why don't I get us some wine? I'll run off to the supermarket.

210
00:14:18,593 --> 00:14:22,034
You know what? Let's eat out instead.

211
00:14:22,034 --> 00:14:23,664
We'll grab something decent to eat.

212
00:14:26,604 --> 00:14:29,874
I know that you're trying your best.

213
00:14:34,803 --> 00:14:37,614
But your best is what I'm sick and tired of.

214
00:14:43,453 --> 00:14:45,524
Hyun Chae, don't be so mad.

215
00:14:46,683 --> 00:14:47,723
I'll...

216
00:14:50,254 --> 00:14:52,823
treat you to dinner at a fancy hotel soon.

217
00:14:59,604 --> 00:15:00,933
Don't overstretch yourself.

218
00:15:02,303 --> 00:15:03,604
We'll just end it.

219
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:09,073
I'll...

220
00:15:12,683 --> 00:15:13,744
I...

221
00:15:17,114 --> 00:15:18,884
I'll do anything...

222
00:15:19,823 --> 00:15:21,183
that you desire.

223
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,624
You trust me, don't you?

224
00:15:32,063 --> 00:15:33,303
I'll...

225
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:38,473
make you the happiest woman ever.

226
00:15:42,343 --> 00:15:43,614
I promise.

227
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:57,193
Then show me you mean it.

228
00:16:02,894 --> 00:16:04,264
No matter what,

229
00:16:05,634 --> 00:16:07,504
I'll show you.

230
00:16:14,303 --> 00:16:17,073
(Patient: Mr. Kim)

231
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:52,543
(Police Line, Do Not Cross)

232
00:17:09,834 --> 00:17:12,233
There isn't a single security camera nearby.

233
00:17:12,963 --> 00:17:15,134
The accident had to happen here out of all places.

234
00:17:15,503 --> 00:17:17,374
The car's dashcam wasn't operating, right?

235
00:17:17,574 --> 00:17:20,144
The car was a rental with a busted dashcam.

236
00:17:21,344 --> 00:17:23,773
We won't know the truth until Mr. Kim wakes up.

237
00:17:24,574 --> 00:17:26,084
Do we know anything about the vehicle that hit his?

238
00:17:26,144 --> 00:17:27,483
We're still investigating.

239
00:17:29,914 --> 00:17:32,624
Check out these skid marks.

240
00:17:37,693 --> 00:17:39,423
These aren't from Mr. Kim's car.

241
00:17:40,294 --> 00:17:42,033
The width of the streaks are off.

242
00:17:43,164 --> 00:17:44,463
Maybe it's from the car at fault.

243
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:46,804
These were made when...

244
00:17:46,804 --> 00:17:48,533
the car at fault accelerated to flee from the scene.

245
00:17:52,503 --> 00:17:55,614
Why aren't there any skid marks made by Kim Seo Jin's vehicle though?

246
00:17:56,973 --> 00:17:58,644
Why didn't he hit the brakes?

247
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:02,453
Check the car for an EDR.

248
00:18:02,453 --> 00:18:03,914
(EDR: a recording device...)

249
00:18:03,914 --> 00:18:05,423
(that saves data before and after a crash)

250
00:18:05,423 --> 00:18:06,824
Where are his wife and child?

251
00:18:58,503 --> 00:19:00,544
Hyun Chae...

252
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,443
No...

253
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:08,443
Hyun Chae...

254
00:19:16,124 --> 00:19:17,554
Hyun Chae...

255
00:19:20,564 --> 00:19:22,164
Hyun Chae!

256
00:19:31,773 --> 00:19:32,943
No...

257
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:39,943
(Caution: slippery floor)

258
00:20:08,673 --> 00:20:11,814
Patient Im Do Yoon in Ward 37.

259
00:20:12,384 --> 00:20:15,584
Patient Im Do Yoon in Ward 37.

260
00:20:15,584 --> 00:20:17,854
Please return to your room.

261
00:20:17,953 --> 00:20:19,423
What are you doing here?

262
00:20:29,794 --> 00:20:32,433
This is what I think sometimes.

263
00:20:34,203 --> 00:20:35,874
I'm glad...

264
00:20:36,203 --> 00:20:38,503
that it's me and not my Ae Ri who's ill.

265
00:20:40,304 --> 00:20:42,173
Watching your child suffer...

266
00:20:43,114 --> 00:20:45,513
is like living in endless torment.

267
00:20:47,884 --> 00:20:49,414
Mr. Kim,

268
00:20:50,614 --> 00:20:53,854
you need to do everything in your power to save your girl.

269
00:20:54,624 --> 00:20:55,693
Right.

270
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:04,834
What is this?

271
00:21:04,834 --> 00:21:07,533
Pay for Ji Ah's surgery with this...

272
00:21:07,604 --> 00:21:08,703
and...

273
00:21:09,904 --> 00:21:11,733
grant me a favour in return.

274
00:21:15,773 --> 00:21:17,074
(1-4 Hangil-ro, Jeongdong-Gu)

275
00:21:18,114 --> 00:21:19,644
What on earth is all this?

276
00:21:19,713 --> 00:21:20,884
Move out of the way.

277
00:21:21,844 --> 00:21:25,183
Geon Wook, help me with this!

278
00:21:27,283 --> 00:21:31,193
Gosh, what do you have in here? Everything you own?

279
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:36,263
I'll now be living here.

280
00:21:36,664 --> 00:21:39,334
What? I'm the owner, you know.

281
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:46,804
I said I'm fine.

282
00:21:47,044 --> 00:21:49,443
You're both overreacting. I'm not some baby.

283
00:21:49,513 --> 00:21:51,713
I, for one, would like to be at ease.

284
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:54,844
You may be fine, but we're too worried about you.

285
00:21:55,483 --> 00:21:56,884
Until your mom comes back...

286
00:21:56,884 --> 00:21:59,654
No, just until you're better, okay?

287
00:22:01,723 --> 00:22:05,324
She's right. Stay with Soo Jung for the time being.

288
00:22:05,794 --> 00:22:06,963
Where should I put all this?

289
00:22:07,164 --> 00:22:10,294
Can I take your mom's room for the time being?

290
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,634
Get these to her room. Hurry.

291
00:22:15,473 --> 00:22:18,673
It's not like I want to stay here that long.

292
00:22:18,703 --> 00:22:20,574
I miss your mom too.

293
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,844
Right. Well, we need to begin a proper search now.

294
00:22:24,273 --> 00:22:27,314
Ae Ri, where do we start? Have you put some thought into it?

295
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:28,513
Yes.

296
00:23:08,183 --> 00:23:10,654
Ma'am, are you looking for a specific something?

297
00:23:25,473 --> 00:23:27,473
Da Bin's home!

298
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:29,773
Mom!

299
00:23:30,273 --> 00:23:33,414
Goodness. Did you have fun today?

300
00:23:34,884 --> 00:23:36,854
It seems like you sweated a lot.

301
00:23:36,854 --> 00:23:39,054
Your skin's a little sticky.

302
00:23:39,124 --> 00:23:40,253
Is that so?

303
00:23:40,854 --> 00:23:42,394
Da Bin, did you sweat today?

304
00:23:43,223 --> 00:23:44,693
Can you help her wash up?

305
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:47,463
- Go and wash up, okay? - Sure, Mom.

306
00:23:47,463 --> 00:23:48,894
What clothes should I change her into?

307
00:23:49,193 --> 00:23:51,433
I'll lay out a set. Here. Let me take your bear.

308
00:23:51,433 --> 00:23:53,104
There you go.

309
00:23:53,104 --> 00:23:54,733
- Da Bin, let's go. - Okay.

310
00:24:30,273 --> 00:24:32,273
What in the world could be in here?

311
00:24:56,033 --> 00:24:57,094
Hello?

312
00:24:57,334 --> 00:24:58,533
This is the pharmacy.

313
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:00,733
I'm calling about the drug you inquired about.

314
00:25:01,503 --> 00:25:04,074
Yes, hello. Did you find out?

315
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,604
It's sertraline.

316
00:25:07,144 --> 00:25:08,273
Sertraline?

317
00:25:08,574 --> 00:25:11,243
It's usually used to treat PTSD.

318
00:25:12,114 --> 00:25:14,544
- I see. - And also to treat depression,

319
00:25:14,544 --> 00:25:16,183
panic disorder, anxiety disorder, and more.

320
00:25:18,923 --> 00:25:20,223
Oh, I see.

321
00:25:20,423 --> 00:25:21,953
Thank you for calling me back.

322
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:23,854
You must consult an expert before you take the pill.

323
00:25:24,253 --> 00:25:27,023
Don't take it without any advice, and make sure you visit your doctor.

324
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:29,394
Yes, thank you.

325
00:25:48,114 --> 00:25:51,283
Why are you back? You didn't leave too long ago.

326
00:25:54,384 --> 00:25:55,894
Well, Detective...

327
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:58,624
- You aren't allowed to barge in. - What's going on?

328
00:26:01,223 --> 00:26:03,064
- Hello. - Hello.

329
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:08,834
So to sum up your story,

330
00:26:09,804 --> 00:26:12,374
your mother isn't actually missing,

331
00:26:12,443 --> 00:26:13,844
but she just left the house.

332
00:26:13,973 --> 00:26:15,743
But she's very ill.

333
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:19,914
I'm scared something may happen while she's out of touch.

334
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:25,354
I see. I can understand how you feel.

335
00:26:26,483 --> 00:26:29,324
If Ae Ri's mother goes to a hospital,

336
00:26:29,624 --> 00:26:31,253
is there a way for her to find out?

337
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:35,324
Oh, the wanted list. What happens with people on the wanted list?

338
00:26:36,533 --> 00:26:39,104
Even if someone is wanted,

339
00:26:39,703 --> 00:26:41,634
there's no way for the hospital...

340
00:26:41,634 --> 00:26:44,203
to find out if the patient is on the wanted list or not.

341
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:02,183
In that case, let's do this.

342
00:27:02,283 --> 00:27:05,423
The Health Insurance Corporation and the National Pension Service...

343
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:08,963
send us a list of people who are missing, but has left a record.

344
00:27:10,064 --> 00:27:12,193
But we'd have to call each hospital...

345
00:27:12,533 --> 00:27:15,233
to find out if the person really came in.

346
00:27:16,304 --> 00:27:19,344
Well, I have your mother's personal information,

347
00:27:19,773 --> 00:27:22,273
so I'll take another look, I guess.

348
00:27:23,443 --> 00:27:25,273
- Thank you so much, Detective. - Don't mention it.

349
00:27:25,614 --> 00:27:27,283
But don't expect too much.

350
00:27:27,283 --> 00:27:29,713
I can't exactly guarantee when I'll find...

351
00:27:29,713 --> 00:27:31,384
your mother. Yes.

352
00:27:33,983 --> 00:27:35,824
- Please take a good look. - Sure.

353
00:27:37,154 --> 00:27:38,294
Thank you.

354
00:27:46,433 --> 00:27:49,304
Hey, why don't we print out some flyers?

355
00:27:50,074 --> 00:27:52,973
We'll find something if we hand out those at places where she could be,

356
00:27:54,074 --> 00:27:55,973
Yes, we should do everything we can.

357
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:01,914
No one can get that information other than the account holder.

358
00:28:02,713 --> 00:28:04,283
Something doesn't feel right.

359
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:07,683
Give me the account number. I might be able to find out.

360
00:28:08,084 --> 00:28:09,124
Don't worry.

361
00:28:09,394 --> 00:28:12,394
I'll make sure I find her.

362
00:28:16,033 --> 00:28:17,493
Mr. Kim...

363
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:21,003
- should be able to find out. - Hey!

364
00:28:21,304 --> 00:28:23,804
If you get involved with him again, I won't just sit around.

365
00:28:23,804 --> 00:28:26,443
Don't even bring him up.

366
00:28:26,804 --> 00:28:28,743
Did you already forget what he put you through?

367
00:28:28,743 --> 00:28:31,414
I wouldn't mind even if it was worse only if I can find her.

368
00:28:32,743 --> 00:28:35,213
I almost killed you, but I got to see you again,

369
00:28:35,443 --> 00:28:38,183
and I found my mom for a short moment...

370
00:28:38,453 --> 00:28:39,624
all thanks to him.

371
00:28:39,624 --> 00:28:41,953
And he also put you in prison.

372
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:45,294
The guy I met at the police station isn't the same Mr. Kim I know.

373
00:28:46,364 --> 00:28:48,624
We only got to talk once a day only for a minute,

374
00:28:49,933 --> 00:28:52,904
but the man I know wasn't a wicked guy.

375
00:28:53,263 --> 00:28:54,904
If it was him in a month...

376
00:28:55,564 --> 00:28:58,533
Okay, let's say everything you said is right.

377
00:28:59,033 --> 00:29:01,644
But can you be sure something like that...

378
00:29:01,644 --> 00:29:04,044
wouldn't happen again if you do as he says?

379
00:29:04,114 --> 00:29:07,314
Yes, who cares if he lives in the future or whatever?

380
00:29:07,743 --> 00:29:10,114
When something happens, he can't even help you.

381
00:29:15,384 --> 00:29:16,554
I'm home.

382
00:30:14,144 --> 00:30:15,144
You're home.

383
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:19,223
What's wrong?

384
00:30:20,483 --> 00:30:23,554
Are you sick? You're breaking out in cold sweats.

385
00:30:24,654 --> 00:30:25,993
No, I'm just tired.

386
00:30:27,193 --> 00:30:28,394
Run along and get some rest.

387
00:30:55,923 --> 00:30:57,054

388
00:30:58,894 --> 00:30:59,894
No, not really.

389
00:31:00,493 --> 00:31:02,064
I'm a bit under the weather.

390
00:31:03,064 --> 00:31:04,864
Do you have any medicine I can take?

391
00:31:05,794 --> 00:31:08,334
No. Is there anything at home?

392
00:31:09,003 --> 00:31:10,973
I forgot to get some last time.

393
00:31:13,874 --> 00:31:15,844
I'll be fine in a moment.

394
00:31:22,683 --> 00:31:23,783

Yes.

417
00:35:03,647 --> 00:35:05,117
What are your symptoms?

418
00:35:05,718 --> 00:35:07,528
It must be because I've been nervous lately.

419
00:35:08,427 --> 00:35:10,227
I often break out in cold sweats,

420
00:35:10,828 --> 00:35:12,658
and at times, I get very dizzy.

421
00:35:13,597 --> 00:35:15,227
Do you have any other symptoms?

422
00:35:20,668 --> 00:35:22,367
Recently, my daughter...

423
00:35:23,638 --> 00:35:26,878
was almost abducted.

424
00:35:30,647 --> 00:35:33,217
Thankfully, it was just an attempt.

425
00:35:34,987 --> 00:35:36,487
But ever since then,

426
00:35:37,957 --> 00:35:39,557
realistic images of her abduction...

427
00:35:40,487 --> 00:35:42,228
and images of my wife jumping down...

428
00:35:44,427 --> 00:35:45,527
to take her own life...

429
00:35:48,568 --> 00:35:49,798
because of the shock,

430
00:35:50,867 --> 00:35:52,437
such horrible images...

431
00:35:53,437 --> 00:35:55,038
continue to come into my head.

432
00:35:55,038 --> 00:35:56,337
That could surely happen.

433
00:35:56,337 --> 00:35:58,337
Even if it was just an attempt,

434
00:35:58,837 --> 00:36:01,078
it must've taken a toll on your mind.

435
00:36:02,978 --> 00:36:06,717
After having a first hand experience of almost losing my family,

436
00:36:08,187 --> 00:36:09,948
I began to look back on myself.

437
00:36:10,957 --> 00:36:12,788
Have I been living the wrong life?

438
00:36:14,027 --> 00:36:15,187
I've been tormented.

439
00:36:15,388 --> 00:36:17,128
It's a sort of a good effect.

440
00:36:17,997 --> 00:36:19,798
There's a good effect that pain can bring.

441
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,889
It's painful to lose something,

442
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:25,659
but it also helps you to discern what's really important.

443
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:30,500
I'll prescribe some medicine for now.

444
00:36:31,699 --> 00:36:34,270
But if things don't get better...

445
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:35,770
even after you take this,

446
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:38,800
you must be thoroughly examined.

447
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,270
(Consulting Room 1)

448
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:45,009
Delusion is...

449
00:36:45,009 --> 00:36:48,109
a symptom associated with many neuropsychiatric disorders.

450
00:36:48,909 --> 00:36:50,780
If you miss the timing of your treatment,

451
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,650
it may be tough to recover.

452
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,919
I suggest that you get examined.

453
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:04,060
So you really found a tracker in that teddy bear?

454
00:37:05,129 --> 00:37:07,770
Yes. What are you going to do now?

455
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,169
- I'll take care of this. - What about Mr. Lee?

456
00:37:14,139 --> 00:37:16,340
No, I'm doing this myself.

457
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,579
I'm worried about you.

458
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:27,920
Are you sure it's okay for you to step in?

459
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,219
Starting now, I'm going to get my hands dirty.

460
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,160
It seems like Taek Gyu is hiding something from me.

461
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,629
Like what?

462
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:41,829
He has been looking into that woman, Han Ae Ri, without telling me.

463
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:45,440
To be exact, he was after Han Ae Ri's mother.

464
00:37:47,269 --> 00:37:50,069
What are you talking about? What about her mother?

465
00:37:51,009 --> 00:37:52,879
Do you remember the collapse of Taejung Town?

466
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:56,579
Han Ae Ri is a family of one of the victims.

467
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:59,920
Kim Jin Ho had been looking for the bereaved family...

468
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,790
because of his daughter.

469
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:05,560
And Taek Gyu was looking for her mother too.

470
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:07,360
Without telling you?

471
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:25,339
Chairman Yu, did you want to see me?

472
00:38:25,339 --> 00:38:28,910
Yes. Did you look into the project for Taejung?

473
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,649
It was inspiring to see that...

474
00:38:30,779 --> 00:38:33,480
Yujung will be in charge of the entire development process.

475
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:37,149
This is the first time in the history of Taejung...

476
00:38:37,149 --> 00:38:39,360
for a private company to lead the project all the way.

477
00:38:39,459 --> 00:38:42,560
I'll do my best to have this project remembered as a successful...

478
00:38:42,629 --> 00:38:43,899
urban development project.

479
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,129
All right.

480
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,829
I heard you dropped her charges.

481
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:49,199
Pardon?

482
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:51,469
Right, yes.

483
00:38:51,469 --> 00:38:53,040
What was her name again?

484
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:56,940
Ms. Han Ae Ri, sir.

485
00:38:59,139 --> 00:39:00,240
Actually,

486
00:39:00,709 --> 00:39:04,579
the mother of that Han Ae Ri or whatever came to see me.

487
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,120
What? What do you mean?

488
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:11,290
Her father was a man who passed away...

489
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:13,019
during the Taejung Town collapse.

490
00:39:16,959 --> 00:39:19,399
I am greatly indebted to the bereaved family...

491
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,629
from that accident.

492
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,500
A total of 71 people lost their lives,

493
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,870
more were injured and affected as their family.

494
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:32,180
I've committed a mortal sin.

495
00:39:34,149 --> 00:39:36,779
But Banyoung Constructions had been in charge...

496
00:39:36,779 --> 00:39:38,420
of the entire construction.

497
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,149
Yujung just had a bit of share in the project.

498
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:43,350
I believe Banyoung was responsible for poor construction...

499
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:44,759
and poor management...

500
00:39:44,759 --> 00:39:46,219
Don't say something like that.

501
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:49,790
So many people died.

502
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,399
There's no use in nitpicking over who did that...

503
00:39:53,399 --> 00:39:55,500
and who committed the bigger crime.

504
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,300
That's all but foolish.

505
00:39:58,899 --> 00:40:00,709
I lived my life to this day...

506
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:04,310
thinking one day, I must compensate for what I did...

507
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,949
for the people of Taejung.

508
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:12,350
I want to return everything I made by building houses...

509
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:14,819
back to the City of Taejung.

510
00:40:17,759 --> 00:40:19,319
I will also remember...

511
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:22,129
this vision of yours, Chairman.

512
00:40:22,129 --> 00:40:23,629
And for you too.

513
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,329
You practically lost your father after that incident.

514
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:31,540
That had always troubled me.

515
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,139
You may go.

516
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:45,850
The rescue of the buried at Taejung Town continues today.

517
00:40:46,019 --> 00:40:47,920
There were many sad stories...

518
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,219
behind the collapse of Taejung Town.

519
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:53,190
Lee, a construction worker who was found dead...

00:40:55,029 --> 00:40:57,629
is a father of an infant who's about to turn one year old.

522
00:40:57,829 --> 00:41:00,360
Among those who were buried, there was a high school student...

523
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,300
who just finished taking their college entrance exam.

524
00:41:02,829 --> 00:41:05,870
Lee was found next to his father...

00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:48,667
By the way, why are you visiting his daughter?

545
00:42:51,968 --> 00:42:54,677
I'll look into it and let him know that you're coming.

546
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:56,577
Don't bother.

547
00:42:57,238 --> 00:43:00,947
It may take a while, so you can go home first.

548
00:43:14,728 --> 00:43:16,827
Sir, did you bring spare clothes for Ji Ah?

549
00:43:16,998 --> 00:43:19,228
Right. I'll bring them right now.

550
00:43:43,917 --> 00:43:46,728
I know I'm late, but I'm sorry.

551
00:43:48,827 --> 00:43:50,868
I looked through every single claim...

552
00:43:51,797 --> 00:43:53,527
that you made.

553
00:43:55,037 --> 00:43:57,667
Please tell me anything you haven't told me yet.

554
00:43:58,338 --> 00:44:01,508
I'm willing to hear you out.

555
00:44:01,508 --> 00:44:04,248
It's all your corporate's fault!

556
00:44:04,748 --> 00:44:07,077
You used illegal materials without even testing them!

557
00:44:07,618 --> 00:44:09,978
That's why the fire broke out!

558
00:44:10,118 --> 00:44:12,988
I don't know what you're basing that claim on,

559
00:44:13,588 --> 00:44:15,088
but if you want,

560
00:44:16,258 --> 00:44:18,057
I'll show you the qualification results...

561
00:44:18,057 --> 00:44:19,388
and get tested for the materials.

562
00:44:19,927 --> 00:44:23,098
If it's revealed that we've made a mistake, I'll take responsibility.

563
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:27,598
Had you... Had you approached me sooner,

564
00:44:28,037 --> 00:44:29,437
we wouldn't have come this far!

565
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,838
I begged and begged for you to hear me out,

566
00:44:32,167 --> 00:44:34,777
but you refused!

567
00:44:36,677 --> 00:44:39,748
It's my fault for being so late. I'm sorry.

568
00:44:41,317 --> 00:44:44,647
Is this a joke to you? Do you think you can understand...

569
00:44:44,817 --> 00:44:46,817
how a terrible father like me feels?

570
00:44:52,687 --> 00:44:54,427
The collapse of Taejung Town.

571
00:44:57,527 --> 00:44:59,368
I was also a victim of that disaster.

572
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,338
That day, I had followed my father to the construction site...

573
00:45:03,338 --> 00:45:05,108
for the first time.

574
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:07,437
My father had escaped.

575
00:45:09,378 --> 00:45:10,708
But I couldn't.

576
00:45:13,407 --> 00:45:15,577
It took a long time until I was rescued,

577
00:45:17,277 --> 00:45:19,018
so my father thought I was dead.

578
00:45:22,258 --> 00:45:23,518
And he jumped from a building.

579
00:45:26,758 --> 00:45:28,728
Why are you telling me this?

580
00:45:31,827 --> 00:45:34,027
I just wanted to tell you...

581
00:45:37,037 --> 00:45:39,638
that I can slightly fathom how it feels to lose your child.

582
00:45:45,108 --> 00:45:48,047
Back then, I resented him for leaving me behind.

583
00:45:49,777 --> 00:45:51,687
"He gave up on me."

584
00:45:52,547 --> 00:45:53,988
"He abandoned me."

585
00:45:54,458 --> 00:45:55,917
"How could he call himself a father?"

586
00:45:56,988 --> 00:45:59,358
"I'll never be like him."

587
00:46:01,397 --> 00:46:03,827
I had filled my head with such selfish thoughts.

588
00:46:06,527 --> 00:46:09,338
"He must've committed suicide because the pain was unbearable."

589
00:46:13,968 --> 00:46:15,608
Now that I've matured and have a kid of my own,

590
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:18,577
such a thought crossed my mind.

591
00:46:26,118 --> 00:46:28,817
I'm sorry for being so chatty when I came to apologize.

592
00:46:29,718 --> 00:46:32,027
I thought you were downright coldhearted.

593
00:46:32,488 --> 00:46:34,858
You're flustering me.

594
00:46:36,998 --> 00:46:39,498
I found out that your daughter and mine are the same age.

595
00:46:41,838 --> 00:46:43,998
I'd like to help your daughter with her treatments.

596
00:46:45,108 --> 00:46:48,338
I'll talk with our social work team.

597
00:47:19,638 --> 00:47:20,638
What did you say?

598
00:47:21,208 --> 00:47:22,437
I can't do this.

599
00:47:22,608 --> 00:47:26,177
I can't leave Ji Ah behind all by herself.

600
00:47:26,647 --> 00:47:29,147
I made a wrong decision.

601
00:47:30,378 --> 00:47:34,187
A father who has given up is worse than one who's poor.

602
00:47:35,518 --> 00:47:37,057
I want to stay by her side...

603
00:47:38,958 --> 00:47:40,657
and do everything I can for her.

604
00:47:41,327 --> 00:47:43,098
Let's call off...

605
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:45,498
the deal we made.

606
00:47:46,027 --> 00:47:48,838
Mr. Kim. Hello?

607
00:47:49,338 --> 00:47:50,468
Hello? Mr. Kim.

608
00:48:02,447 --> 00:48:03,447
What did he say?

609
00:48:04,787 --> 00:48:05,787
Did he back out?

610
00:48:06,287 --> 00:48:07,858
Let's look for another way.

611
00:48:12,927 --> 00:48:15,598
I'll get rid of him.

612
00:48:16,628 --> 00:48:18,368
Don't you dare.

613
00:48:35,547 --> 00:48:38,888
Please give me some time to think about it.

614
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:42,557
I know this isn't easy.

615
00:48:43,488 --> 00:48:46,758
I know I've put you on the spot.

616
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:48,327
But this is...

617
00:48:49,827 --> 00:48:52,197
the only thing I can do...

618
00:48:52,598 --> 00:48:53,968
to protect my baby.

619
00:48:59,768 --> 00:49:02,077

Oh, right. Should we hand out the flyers...

622
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:30,437
at that big intersection first tomorrow?

623
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:32,638
There are many taxi drivers there.

624
00:49:34,108 --> 00:49:36,208
What do you think? Are you listening?

You're from Yujung Constructions.

630
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:19,847
What happened?

631
00:50:21,817 --> 00:50:23,758
Judging by the damages left on the vehicle...

632
00:50:24,018 --> 00:50:27,027
and how the victims' bodies were mainly injured on the right,

633
00:50:27,387 --> 00:50:30,258
we believe the other car came from the right.

634
00:50:33,297 --> 00:50:34,438
Does that mean...

635
00:50:36,998 --> 00:50:38,367
Ms. Kang and her daughter...

636
00:50:40,738 --> 00:50:43,738
passed away on the spot?

637
00:50:44,238 --> 00:50:46,478
Unfortunately, that's the case.

638
00:50:47,607 --> 00:50:50,448
When we had gotten to them, they had already passed away.

639
00:50:58,387 --> 00:50:59,557
By the way,

640
00:51:00,658 --> 00:51:02,198
were you aware...

641
00:51:02,898 --> 00:51:06,768
that Mr. Kim was taking medication related to mental illnesses?

642
00:51:07,728 --> 00:51:08,768
No.

643
00:51:08,768 --> 00:51:10,797
The medication is used for various illnesses.

644
00:51:12,268 --> 00:51:14,708
But here's the issue. You get drowsy.

645
00:51:15,008 --> 00:51:16,908
And that could be life-threatening.

646
00:51:20,208 --> 00:51:21,347
Then...

647
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:26,317
are you saying...

648
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:29,918
he could've caused the accident?

649
00:51:29,918 --> 00:51:32,857
His blood test showed a significant amount of the drug.

650
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:37,198
I wonder why he took it when he had to drive.

I know that you're only fuelled by money.

668
00:53:49,132 --> 00:53:50,672
So who's paying for this case?

669
00:53:55,712 --> 00:53:58,813
It doesn't matter though because I'll pay double.

I need him to help me to find my mom.

725
00:58:07,523 --> 00:58:08,692
Lee Taek Gyu...

726
00:58:09,632 --> 00:58:11,093
I need to meet with him.

727
00:58:12,462 --> 00:58:15,573
He probably knows where she is anyway.

728
00:58:15,573 --> 00:58:16,833
That's the worst idea ever.

729
00:58:17,533 --> 00:58:20,243
He's the most dangerous of them all. Are you out of your mind?

What's this?

732
00:58:29,983 --> 00:58:31,882
Kim Seo Jin will be there,

733
00:58:32,283 --> 00:58:33,952
which means that Lee Taek Gyu will be there too.

734
00:58:34,652 --> 00:58:37,723
A public location with many eyes watching...

735
00:58:37,892 --> 00:58:39,392
won't be that dangerous.

736
00:58:47,862 --> 00:58:48,872

I can't believe you didn't take my side on this.

750
00:59:16,632 --> 00:59:18,833
Didn't you warn her yesterday about even mentioning Kim Seo Jin?

751
00:59:18,862 --> 00:59:21,202
But Lee Taek Gyu sent her mom that money.

752
00:59:21,602 --> 00:59:23,473
This makes way more sense compared to...

753
00:59:23,473 --> 00:59:24,803

(The Bereaved of the Taejung Town Accident...)

783
01:00:32,303 --> 01:00:35,212
Hello, everyone. I'm Kim Seo Jin,

784
01:00:35,843 --> 01:00:39,343
the task director of the Taejung New Town Project.

785
01:00:41,513 --> 01:00:43,382
There's a place...

786
01:00:43,382 --> 01:00:45,852
I visited before coming to this auditorium.

787
01:00:47,122 --> 01:00:48,152
It was...

788
01:00:48,852 --> 01:00:51,293
the memorial park that was set up...

789
01:00:52,263 --> 01:00:53,763
for the victims of the Taejung Town incident.

790
01:00:55,362 --> 01:00:59,162
19 years ago, where the devastating accident took place,

791
01:01:00,033 --> 01:01:01,662
I made it out as the last survivor.

792
01:01:07,602 --> 01:01:09,513
Not even a slither of light could be seen...

793
01:01:09,773 --> 01:01:12,583
as I stayed confined not knowing how many days went by.

794
01:01:16,983 --> 01:01:20,283
I was miraculously rescued 31 days after the accident.

795
01:01:21,182 --> 01:01:23,652
However, the joy of survival didn't last.

796
01:01:24,493 --> 01:01:25,862
Because...

797
01:01:26,392 --> 01:01:29,093
my father who also worked at the construction site...

798
01:01:29,733 --> 01:01:31,093
(Taejung New Town Project Background)

799
01:01:31,932 --> 01:01:33,102
He was gone.

800
01:01:44,142 --> 01:01:47,283
A week prior to my rescue,

801
01:01:49,783 --> 01:01:51,013
despondent about the situation,

802
01:01:53,152 --> 01:01:55,523
he committed suicide.

803
01:01:57,952 --> 01:02:01,263
I thought I'd feel better since many years had passed.

804
01:02:01,523 --> 01:02:03,462
But as I entered the memorial park,

805
01:02:04,962 --> 01:02:06,033
my entire body...

806
01:02:08,602 --> 01:02:09,632
trembled.

807
01:02:11,973 --> 01:02:13,803
The memory of having lost someone...

808
01:02:15,872 --> 01:02:17,973
doesn't seem to fade away with time.

809
01:02:23,513 --> 01:02:24,553
Therefore,

810
01:02:25,452 --> 01:02:28,053
I know exactly what I need to do...

811
01:02:28,352 --> 01:02:30,093
in Taejung.

812
01:02:30,993 --> 01:02:33,023
Helping those who have collapsed get back on their feet.

813
01:02:33,493 --> 01:02:35,263
Protecting those who are cherished.

814
01:02:35,632 --> 01:02:39,303
I won't be simply constructing. I'll be building...

815
01:02:39,533 --> 01:02:42,273
a healthy, strong foundation that'll protect our beloved ones.

816
01:02:43,132 --> 01:02:46,073
Just like how I held out for 31 days as the last survivor,

817
01:02:46,602 --> 01:02:49,773
I'll construct Taejung New Town in earnest.

818
01:02:50,243 --> 01:02:51,473
I beg you.

819
01:02:52,083 --> 01:02:55,412
Please allow this precious land...

01:02:55,513 --> 01:02:58,182
to Yujung Constructions and me, Kim Seo Jin,

with them regarding the construction.

828

It's been a long time.

829
01:04:19,162 --> 01:04:20,432
I'm going to call the cops.

830
01:04:20,462 --> 01:04:22,233
Sure, if you can.

831
01:04:23,172 --> 01:04:26,642
I'm ready to tell the truth.

832
01:04:27,543 --> 01:04:28,743
Do you know...

833
01:04:30,243 --> 01:04:33,483
what the most painful death is?

834
01:04:36,152 --> 01:04:37,882
It's getting burned to death.

835
01:04:38,682 --> 01:04:41,382
Do you know why the underworld is blazing hot?

836
01:04:42,922 --> 01:04:44,223

But I've managed to survive.

839
01:04:52,102 --> 01:04:53,503
You should...

840
01:04:56,372 --> 01:04:59,273
pay properly for what you've done.

841
01:05:00,202 --> 01:05:01,602
I promised to give you anything!

842
01:05:05,712 --> 01:05:08,243
You have a month. That's it.

843
01:05:09,112 --> 01:05:11,912

844
01:05:12,983 --> 01:05:16,723
and your daughter will go through the same thing.

846
01:05:22,093 --> 01:05:23,162
- Okay. - I'll go over there.

847
01:05:23,493 --> 01:05:24,593
- Do you have the photo? - Yes.

848
01:05:24,593 --> 01:05:26,162
- Look around and let me know. - Okay.

849
01:05:26,162 --> 01:05:27,233
I'll call you.

850
01:05:28,702 --> 01:05:29,803
Why are you here?

851
01:05:33,803 --> 01:05:35,073
Don't misunderstand.

852
01:05:35,243 --> 01:05:37,412
I'm also a bereaved family member.

853
01:05:37,942 --> 01:05:40,743
Yes. I'm aware of that.

854
01:05:41,212 --> 01:05:42,283
How?

855
01:05:45,922 --> 01:05:48,922
By any chance, did you remember something?

856
01:05:50,152 --> 01:05:51,823
Is there something I need to remember?

857
01:05:53,462 --> 01:05:54,523
Never mind.

858
01:05:55,223 --> 01:05:56,892
By the way, where's Mr. Lee Taek Gyu?

859
01:05:56,993 --> 01:05:58,333
He's on vacation.

860
01:05:58,803 --> 01:06:01,263
But how do you know him?

861
01:06:01,932 --> 01:06:03,573
You wouldn't believe me even if I told you.

862
01:06:03,632 --> 01:06:04,672
Sir.

863
01:06:05,973 --> 01:06:07,102
Is something the matter?

864
01:06:07,702 --> 01:06:09,112
We're done here.

865
01:06:10,273 --> 01:06:12,243
Don't worry about it. I'm going to talk with the manager.

866
01:06:21,523 --> 01:06:22,593
You should know when to stop.

867
01:06:23,952 --> 01:06:24,952
What did I do?

868
01:06:25,053 --> 01:06:26,462
You were granted leniency,

869
01:06:26,993 --> 01:06:28,662
so why are you still approaching him?

870
01:06:30,162 --> 01:06:33,803
While tailing Lee Taek Gyu today, I saw Seo Do Kyun with him.

871
01:06:34,033 --> 01:06:37,172
They were at that studio where you almost lost your life.

872
01:06:40,243 --> 01:06:42,343
Rather, you should know when to stop.

873
01:06:44,273 --> 01:06:45,343
What did you say?

874
01:06:48,243 --> 01:06:49,952
What do you want from Mr. Kim?

875
01:06:56,523 --> 01:06:58,962
If you have nothing to hide, ask him for it directly.

876
01:06:59,063 --> 01:07:00,922
Don't try to stab him in the back while in hiding.

877
01:07:48,073 --> 01:07:49,172
Why?

878
01:07:53,143 --> 01:07:54,343
Why are you the only survivor?

879
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:24,013
I could kill you right now.

880
01:08:28,612 --> 01:08:29,953
But I need to know...

881
01:08:33,323 --> 01:08:35,022
why Hyun Chae had to die.

01:10:50,823 --> 01:10:53,522
Even I'm baffled as to why they were in the car as well.

904
01:10:53,763 --> 01:10:55,893
Why did you kill Hyun Chae? Why?

905
01:10:56,393 --> 01:10:58,062
If you're not going to die, wake up already.

906
01:10:58,462 --> 01:11:00,332
I can only save Hyun Chae once you wake up.

907
01:11:00,433 --> 01:11:02,502
Sir, did you know my father?

908
01:11:02,772 --> 01:11:05,573
Your father would've never killed himself and left you behind.

909
01:11:05,743 --> 01:11:07,373
Mr. Kim, where are you right now?

910
01:11:08,042 --> 01:11:10,112
- What in the world happened? - It wasn't...

911
01:11:11,212 --> 01:11:14,482
If you kill Lee Taek Gyu for me, I'll do whatever you want me to do.

912
01:11:15,112 --> 01:11:16,812
He wants me to kill Lee Taek Gyu?
