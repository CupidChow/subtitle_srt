(actual people, organizations, products, or incidents.)

3
00:00:14,744 --> 00:00:16,244
- Brava. - Brava.

4
00:00:17,368 --> 00:00:19,439
Da Bin has disappeared.

5
00:00:20,255 --> 00:00:21,284
Da Bin!

6
00:00:22,884 --> 00:00:23,955
Kim Da Bin!

7
00:00:24,694 --> 00:00:27,124
Mr. Kim Seo Jin. Do you want to see your daughter?

8
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:29,194
- Please. I beg you. - I'll pay however much you want.

9
00:00:29,395 --> 00:00:31,334
Please just send her back home in one piece. Please!

10
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,234
Da Bin is likely to be dead.

11
00:00:33,234 --> 00:00:35,204
I don't think I can continue living...

12
00:00:36,565 --> 00:00:37,605
without Da Bin.

13
00:00:47,045 --> 00:00:49,115
I've seen this Da Bin girl.

14
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:50,685
What's today's date?

15
00:00:50,685 --> 00:00:52,514
Are you living in August right now?

16
00:00:52,514 --> 00:00:54,584
It's Thursday, August 13, 2020.

17
00:00:54,584 --> 00:00:56,325
I might sound like a lunatic,

18
00:00:56,325 --> 00:00:58,094
but please save my wife and my daughter.

19
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:01,264
I'm currently living a month ahead of you.

20
00:01:02,365 --> 00:01:04,795
Did Ms. Kwak Song Ja in Room 35 change the room?

21
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:06,665
She was discharged.

22
00:01:07,165 --> 00:01:08,204
Mom.

23
00:01:09,635 --> 00:01:10,635
Mom!

24
00:01:10,975 --> 00:01:12,975
Mom. Where are you?

25
00:01:13,204 --> 00:01:14,305
Are you serious?

26
00:01:15,704 --> 00:01:17,745
Are you really from the future?

27
00:01:18,775 --> 00:01:20,215
If you are, please...

28
00:01:21,545 --> 00:01:23,344
find my mom!

29
00:01:27,685 --> 00:01:31,454
I kidnapped Kim Da Bin!

30
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:34,225
I kidnapped Kim Da Bin...

31
00:01:34,225 --> 00:01:35,325
Search him!

32
00:01:35,424 --> 00:01:38,665
Kim Seo Jin killed my kid.

33
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:10,065
(1-4 Hangil-ro, Jeongdong-gu, Seoul, Han Ae Ri)

34
00:02:19,774 --> 00:02:20,834
Hello?

35
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:25,875
Really?

36
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,744
Then I'll be there right now.

37
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,494
Are you going to remain silent?

38
00:02:48,864 --> 00:02:52,434
Didn't you walk in here yourself all ready to spill it all?

39
00:02:52,475 --> 00:02:53,905
Please get Mr. Kim Seo Jin here.

40
00:02:59,575 --> 00:03:00,644
Search him!

41
00:03:00,644 --> 00:03:02,445
Kim Seo Jin killed my kid.

42
00:03:02,445 --> 00:03:05,415
Because Kim Seo Jin killed my kid!

43
00:03:09,385 --> 00:03:10,584
I got his personal information.

44
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:13,255
Name, Kim Jin Ho, 43 years old, currently unemployed.

45
00:03:13,924 --> 00:03:16,764
He got divorced and brought up two kids all by himself, but look.

46
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:17,834
(Children: Kim Ji Soo, deceased, Kim Ji Ah)

47
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:19,964
His kid really did die.

48
00:03:21,264 --> 00:03:23,905
Look for the kid's death certificate and the postmortem report.

49
00:03:23,905 --> 00:03:26,234
- Yes, sir. - And run a component analysis.

50
00:03:26,234 --> 00:03:27,605
We'll have the result soon.

51
00:03:38,692 --> 00:03:41,762
(Kairos)

52
00:03:41,762 --> 00:03:44,062
I'd like to meet Director Kim Seo Jin.

53
00:03:44,062 --> 00:03:46,431
I see, yes. Did you make an appointment?

54
00:03:47,132 --> 00:03:49,901
I didn't, but this is very important.

55
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:51,102
(Episode 3)

56
00:03:51,102 --> 00:03:53,102
I'll explain it to him once I meet him.

57
00:03:53,271 --> 00:03:56,171
You cannot go in unless you have an appointment.

58
00:03:56,741 --> 00:03:57,842
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:07,921 --> 00:04:09,551
(All employees of Yujung Constructions must wear an ID.)

60
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:10,982
The chairman is coming in through the front gate.

61
00:04:12,292 --> 00:04:13,692
Opening up the security gates.

62
00:04:19,431 --> 00:04:20,662
Mr. Kim Seo Jin.

63
00:04:26,702 --> 00:04:30,042
This is a murderous company! You must apologize! Apologize!

64
00:04:30,042 --> 00:04:33,542
- Murderous company, apologize! - What are you doing?

65
00:04:33,542 --> 00:04:37,011
This is a murderous company! You must apologize! Apologize!

66
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:38,681
Let me go! Let go!

67
00:04:39,482 --> 00:04:40,912
Bring my daughter back!

68
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:42,522
Let me go!

69
00:04:42,821 --> 00:04:45,691
I'm not going to let you off like this!

70
00:04:46,092 --> 00:04:47,821
Bring my daughter back alive!

71
00:04:48,261 --> 00:04:50,691
This is a murderous company!

72
00:04:51,131 --> 00:04:52,191
Apologize!

73
00:05:02,842 --> 00:05:05,142
Director Kim, join me upstairs.

74
00:05:05,871 --> 00:05:06,871
Yes, sir.

75
00:05:17,852 --> 00:05:22,321
(Conduct a thorough investigation of the deadly Yujung Constructions!)

76

(Conduct a thorough investigation of the deadly Yujung Constructions!)

77
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:33,631
Seo Jin, I thought you took care of everything.

78
00:05:34,671 --> 00:05:36,741
I'll make sure you won't have to be concerned.

79
00:05:37,811 --> 00:05:40,311
Our hearts can be very cunning.

80
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:43,412
Someone may not do anything right,

81
00:05:44,212 --> 00:05:46,282
then when they get one thing right, it seems commendable.

82
00:05:46,912 --> 00:05:49,282
But if you make 1 mistake after doing 10 things right,

83
00:05:49,551 --> 00:05:50,852
it'll be the end.

84
00:05:59,131 --> 00:06:00,162
Mr. Seo.

85
00:06:01,631 --> 00:06:02,732
I need you in my office.

86
00:06:07,602 --> 00:06:08,702
Come in.

87
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,229
Yes, sir.

88
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,570
Did you see that guy in the lobby?

89
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,099
Sorry?

90
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,669
The problematic consumer who filed a complaint...

91
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:24,870
regarding the finishing materials used for the amusement complex.

92
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,640
("Amusement Complex Victim Dies,")

93
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,210
("Did the Illegal Materials Worsen the Situation?")

94
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,810
Are you talking about Mr. Kim Jin Ho?

95
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:36,020
According to this report, wasn't that case already closed?

96
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,179
That's correct.

97
00:06:37,549 --> 00:06:41,320
Mr. Kim claimed that the materials we used at the amusement complex...

98
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,260
was his child's cause of death.

99
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,659
The quality of the materials used and the fire test...

100
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:47,029
showed no issues.

101
00:06:47,489 --> 00:06:51,299
But most of all, we found no link between them...

102
00:06:51,299 --> 00:06:53,099
- and his child's death. - That's not the problem.

103
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,440
The chairman saw him.

104
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,409
He values the company's reputation more than the facts.

105
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,179
I'll make sure he doesn't come back here.

106
00:07:04,179 --> 00:07:05,880
- How? - Sorry?

107
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,219
Perhaps, we could give him a small compensation.

108
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:12,890
No, don't give him any money.

109
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:15,190
He's not going to get what he wants.

110
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,529
He'll ask for more later on.

111
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:23,700
If we give him money, it's never going to end.

112
00:07:25,469 --> 00:07:26,469
Yes, sir.

114
00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:44,320

(Conduct a thorough investigation of the deadly Yujung Constructions!)

116
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,299
Come on. Give that to me.

117
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:57,299
- You need to leave. - Give it back. What are you doing?

118
00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:02,200
- Gosh. - Darn it.

119
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,469
- Leave. - Stop it! That's enough!

120
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,510
- Who are you? - Are you all right?

121
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,909
- Leave. - Stop this! Give that back!

122
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,179
Lift him up. Leave.

123
00:08:11,179 --> 00:08:13,010
- You guys shouldn't be here. - That's enough.

124
00:08:14,409 --> 00:08:15,919
I'll take care of this. You may go back inside.

125

Sir, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

126
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,120
Are you with him?

127
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,630
No, he just dropped this.

128
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:27,390
Sir. Hold on.

129
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,470
Okay.

132
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,709
Are you the person in charge?

I'm not, but I can relay your message to the higher-ups.

Hey.

142
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,130
I searched up the resident registration number,

143

but there were no medical records in the past month.

145
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:50,209
if the person passed away during that time?

148

once they receive the files.

and have lost our kids.

183
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,370
Your father worked as a construction worker, right?

184
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:32,970
Mine did too.

185
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:37,640
Come to think of it, we both lost our kids to each other.

186
00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:41,250
Don't tell me...

187
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,120
that you killed...

188
00:12:44,419 --> 00:12:45,419
my daughter.

189
00:12:48,189 --> 00:12:49,520
Answer me, you scumbag.

190
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:52,090
What did you do to her?

191
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:53,789
You killed mine!

192
00:12:56,929 --> 00:12:57,929
Mr. Kim!

193
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:41,340
All right.

194
00:13:43,439 --> 00:13:45,049
If I was going to meet you...

195
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,549
When was I supposed to see you?

196
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,689
What I mean is...

197
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,490
When did you decide to kidnap Da Bin?

198
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:02,860
When was I supposed to meet you...

199
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:06,569
to have prevented all this?

200
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,299
Does it even matter anymore?

201
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,110
What is it? Do you regret it now that your kid's dead?

202
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,539
Answer me!

203
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,750
Have you ever breathed underwater?

204
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,819
What?

205
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,289
My daughter's doctor told me...

206
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,360
that her lungs...

207
00:14:41,029 --> 00:14:42,500
weren't functioning properly...

208
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,110
and that it was similar...

209
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:46,669
to breathing underwater.

210
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,039
Scumbags like you probably don't know...

211
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,579
how that feels, do you?

212
00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:56,079
Can you even fathom the pain you had given her?

213
00:14:58,179 --> 00:14:59,520
So...

214
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:01,990
what you're saying is...

215
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,260
Due to the illegal materials you used,

216
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,090
the building caught on fire.

217
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:07,829
And due to that fire,

218
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,870
my daughter suffered from inhalation injuries.

219
00:15:12,669 --> 00:15:14,270
In the end, she died of pulmonary angioneurotic edema.

220
00:15:14,669 --> 00:15:17,240
I never used illegal materials. What are you talking about?

221
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,439
Whom are you trying to fool?

222
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:22,709
I know you guys fabricated the material test results.

223
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,809
Do you have proof?

224
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:27,380
Do you?

225
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,319
How can I prove that?

226
00:15:32,419 --> 00:15:35,789
All the powerful scumbags are on your side.

227
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:39,260
Did you ask when you were supposed to meet me?

228
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,959
You should've met me when I was at your lobby,

229
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,799
screaming and shouting relentlessly!

230
00:15:52,439 --> 00:15:53,640
So...

231
00:15:56,779 --> 00:15:58,579
What did you do a month ago?

232
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,179
Tell me where you were a month ago.

233
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:04,750
What kind of nonsense are you spewing?

234
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,490
If you really are the killer, then we're just getting started.

235
00:16:08,689 --> 00:16:10,189
When, where, and how.

236
00:16:10,689 --> 00:16:12,559
You will reveal the details of the murder.

237
00:16:12,789 --> 00:16:14,090
But know this.

238
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,100
I will prevent this from ever happening.

239
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,299
I surely will.

I'd like a record...

243

of his credit card and transportation card payments.

244
00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:34,049
You haven't been making any sense today,

245
00:16:34,909 --> 00:16:37,480
so why don't you go home and get some rest?

246
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:39,049

It's everything I have left.

251
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,239
I put my room back on the market.

252
00:17:31,769 --> 00:17:33,509
I'll pay you more once I get my deposit back.

253
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,749
- The rest... - That's not yours to hand over!

00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:08,909
to put a roof over your head.

260
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,509
If you give up that deposit money,

261

- I don't quite follow. - I remember it being a month back.

272
00:19:26,419 --> 00:19:27,820
There was a man protesting in the lobby.

- Kim Jin Ho? - Yes, that's the one.

Why are you suddenly asking about him?

275

Because he killed my Da Bin.

So please calm down for a second.

she didn't visit any hospitals.

327
00:22:46,489 --> 00:22:48,620
Does that imply that she hasn't...

328
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,919
been sick for the past month?

329
00:22:51,219 --> 00:22:54,729
To be honest, I even checked the morgues.

330
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:56,159
She wasn't listed anywhere.

ever approached my daughter?

366
00:25:38,927 --> 00:25:42,127
I'm not sure. It's not a familiar face.

367
00:25:42,127 --> 00:25:44,326
He would've been lurking around her before she was kidnapped.

368
00:25:44,367 --> 00:25:46,066
You would've ran into him somewhere.

369
00:25:47,766 --> 00:25:49,437
Is he the kidnapper?

370
00:25:50,437 --> 00:25:54,177
From what I recall, no stranger ever approached Da Bin.

371
00:25:55,877 --> 00:25:59,016
Besides, I would've taken action if that were true.

372
00:26:02,617 --> 00:26:06,286
(Sky Kids Cafe, 11am, Da Bin's snack, drink: 27 dollars)

373
00:26:12,357 --> 00:26:13,397
What about your mom?

374
00:26:14,496 --> 00:26:15,967
Did anyone give you a call?

375
00:26:19,697 --> 00:26:21,036
Don't be too worried.

376
00:26:22,607 --> 00:26:24,637
I'm sure she's somewhere safe.

377
00:26:31,407 --> 00:26:32,617
By any chance,

378
00:26:33,046 --> 00:26:35,217
do you know anyone who works at Yujung Constructions?

379
00:26:35,516 --> 00:26:36,746
Yujung Constructions?

380
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,556
The company that builds apartments? Why?

381
00:26:39,756 --> 00:26:41,957
I need to get in there, but I can't seem to find a way.

382
00:26:42,016 --> 00:26:44,726
Are you saying you have to get a job at Yujung Constructions?

383
00:26:45,086 --> 00:26:48,957
No, it's not that. There's something I need to do there.

384
00:26:49,897 --> 00:26:51,167
But they require...

385
00:26:51,397 --> 00:26:54,637
an employee ID to get through their security gates.

386
00:26:54,637 --> 00:26:56,667
Yes, that's how things usually are.

387
00:26:57,736 --> 00:26:59,907
Anyway, why do you need to get into their office?

388
00:27:01,937 --> 00:27:03,147
Hey!

389
00:27:03,576 --> 00:27:04,707
What do you want?

390
00:27:07,746 --> 00:27:09,986
I'm done cleaning up the storage. What else should I do?

391
00:27:10,016 --> 00:27:11,486
It's fine. You can go.

392
00:27:11,847 --> 00:27:13,187
You can't let him go.

393
00:27:13,387 --> 00:27:15,857
Geon Wook, look at how dirty the freezer is.

394
00:27:17,986 --> 00:27:21,326
Hey, take a hint and make sure you behave. Okay?

395
00:27:22,357 --> 00:27:23,627
Anyway, what was she saying...

396
00:27:24,467 --> 00:27:25,467
about Yujung Constructions?

397
00:27:25,526 --> 00:27:27,437
Why? Do you know anyone?

398
00:27:28,066 --> 00:27:29,167
No.

399
00:27:30,336 --> 00:27:33,107
Stop bothering Ae Ri from studying and go.

400
00:27:33,907 --> 00:27:36,476
She probably couldn't study lately because of me.

401
00:27:36,976 --> 00:27:39,617
Seriously? You're very considerate, aren't you?

402
00:27:41,147 --> 00:27:43,217
I'm proud of you. Very proud.

403
00:27:56,427 --> 00:27:58,127
It's called Sky Kids Cafe,

404
00:27:58,326 --> 00:27:59,867
the place right across the river.

405
00:28:00,097 --> 00:28:02,536
I'm sure the director also knows where it is.

406
00:28:02,907 --> 00:28:05,167
He stopped by a few times to pick up Da Bin.

407
00:28:10,677 --> 00:28:12,647
May I see the security footage here?

408
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:13,976
The security footage?

409
00:28:14,147 --> 00:28:16,687
Yes, there's something I must check. Please.

410
00:28:16,816 --> 00:28:18,217
From when?

411
00:28:18,347 --> 00:28:21,917
Those get deleted after a week, so you probably can't see it.

412
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:23,957
Between 11am to 1pm on August 27.

413
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:27,756
I'm not sure if we have any backup.

414
00:28:28,357 --> 00:28:30,097
I'll check.

415
00:28:30,097 --> 00:28:31,167
All right.

416
00:28:36,707 --> 00:28:39,536
(Backup)

417
00:28:51,286 --> 00:28:54,786
We don't have it. Everything from a week before is deleted.

418
00:28:54,986 --> 00:28:56,127
Are you sure?

419
00:28:56,357 --> 00:28:59,256
If you needed it that badly, you should've come earlier.

420
00:28:59,256 --> 00:29:01,056
That was ages ago.

421
00:29:10,236 --> 00:29:11,336
Are you all right?

422
00:29:13,076 --> 00:29:14,836
- Yes. - Are you sure you aren't hurt?

423
00:29:15,276 --> 00:29:16,447
Where's your mom...

424
00:29:16,907 --> 00:29:18,677
It's a secret from my mom.

425
00:29:19,107 --> 00:29:21,377
My mom might get worried.

426
00:29:39,296 --> 00:29:40,736
Oh no. What do I do?

427
00:29:41,597 --> 00:29:42,637
What's going on?

428
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:46,207
- Honey, to the hospital. Now. - Why? Is she hurt?

429
00:29:46,377 --> 00:29:48,836
She has rashes all over her body. Go get the car.

430
00:29:53,546 --> 00:29:54,776
Da Bin, are you okay?

431
00:29:55,147 --> 00:29:56,217
Sit right here.

432
00:29:56,447 --> 00:29:58,486
You aren't feverish. Could it be food poisoning?

433
00:29:58,847 --> 00:30:00,586
Do you know Doctor Kang's number?

434
00:30:00,617 --> 00:30:01,687
No.

435
00:30:02,056 --> 00:30:03,786
Wait, my phone.

436
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,286
Da Bin, stay here for a second.

437
00:30:09,566 --> 00:30:12,296
Why didn't you say anything? If you were sick, you should say so.

438
00:30:16,407 --> 00:30:18,437
I'm sorry. I wasn't angry at you.

439
00:30:19,707 --> 00:30:22,976
I'm sure it itched or hurt before. Then you should hurry up and...

440
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:25,546
You and Mom might get into a fight because of me.

441
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:29,986
- What? - I didn't want you and Mom...

442
00:30:29,986 --> 00:30:33,357
to get into a fight worrying about me.

443
00:30:43,526 --> 00:30:45,296
- You can start driving. - Okay.

444
00:30:45,467 --> 00:30:48,437
Da Bin, are you okay? You'll be fine.

445
00:31:04,269 --> 00:31:05,400
Da Bin.

446
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:08,310
It wasn't because of you.

447
00:31:11,779 --> 00:31:13,810
That didn't happen because of you.

448
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:46,179
But they require an employee ID to get through...

449
00:31:46,179 --> 00:31:47,979
their security gates.

450
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,360
Hey.

451
00:31:58,489 --> 00:31:59,560
What's up?

452
00:32:00,229 --> 00:32:03,630
How can you get your hands on a company's security pass?

453
00:32:03,729 --> 00:32:06,429
You know, those cards that you beep to open the gates.

454
00:32:06,729 --> 00:32:09,070
- RFID cards? - Yes, that thing.

455
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:12,269
There's this reader called antennas.

456
00:32:12,969 --> 00:32:15,870
You don't even have to touch it. Once it's within 20cm,

457
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:17,910
it'll decipher the code.

458
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:21,650
You'll install a decoding program, so the code will get decoded.

459
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:24,850
Once you copy that on to an empty card, it's all set.

460
00:32:26,689 --> 00:32:28,320
Can you make me one?

461
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,489
That'll be 100 dollars.

462
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,820
Why is it that expensive?

463
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,060
Never mind, it's 120 dollars including the travel expenses.

464
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,830
Hey, can you give me a discount?

465
00:32:38,699 --> 00:32:39,999
I can't.

466
00:32:40,499 --> 00:32:41,870
Come on!

467
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,110
(1-4 Hangil-ro)

468
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:51,810
You can use this.

469
00:32:54,749 --> 00:32:55,880
What is it?

470
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:59,449
It's for that company you mentioned. The ID for Yujung Constructions.

471
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,719
How did you get this?

472
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:06,959
There's this guy I know at our shopping arcade.

473
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:10,229
He has been a computer security consultant for 15 years...

474
00:33:11,429 --> 00:33:14,370
Anyway, he made that, so you can just use it.

475
00:33:14,699 --> 00:33:16,769
Wait, is this...

476
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,610
This time, it'll work.

477
00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:21,410
Bye.

479
00:33:43,729 --> 00:33:44,830
Hello? Ms. Han Ae Ri.

480
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,130
I know this person.

481
00:33:46,429 --> 00:33:48,769
He's the guy who had been protesting alone at your office.

482
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,269
So you've seen him too.

483
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:52,670
Are you serious?

484
00:33:53,439 --> 00:33:56,380
I can't believe it. How can he do this as another dad?

485
00:33:56,739 --> 00:33:57,779
No.

486
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:01,179
I'm going to save Da Bin and my wife.

487
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:02,920
I'm going to stop him.

488
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,350
I'll stop him before that day so that something like this...

489
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:09,619
doesn't happen to begin with.

490
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:16,499
I might be able to see you tomorrow.

491
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:19,200
My friend made me an employee ID for your company.

492
00:34:19,999 --> 00:34:23,700
But what am I going to say and how should I tell you this?

493
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,610
Do you really think you'll believe me?

494
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:31,639
There's something I need to tell Da Bin...

495
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,880
when I see her again.

496
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,220

498
00:35:59,242 --> 00:36:00,342
Does it not work?

499
00:36:02,582 --> 00:36:04,382
It doesn't seem to work too well.

500
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,751
It malfunctions from time to time.

00:36:09,882 --> 00:36:11,251

May I help you?

506
00:36:48,922 --> 00:36:51,261
I need to tell something to Mr. Kim Seo Jin.

507
00:36:51,332 --> 00:36:53,192
Do you have an appointment?

508
00:36:57,362 --> 00:36:59,431
- Wait! - Mr. Kim Seo Jin!

509
00:36:59,431 --> 00:37:00,901
You can't go in. You need to go now.

510
00:37:00,901 --> 00:37:03,601
One second. I need to tell him something. It's about Da Bin.

511
00:37:03,701 --> 00:37:05,511
Da Bin is in danger!

512
00:37:09,142 --> 00:37:10,282
Tell me.

513
00:37:13,651 --> 00:37:17,282
You need to listen closely to what I'm about to tell you.

514
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:24,492
In a few weeks, your daughter, Kim Da Bin,

515
00:37:25,892 --> 00:37:28,102
will get kidnapped and murdered,

516
00:37:30,602 --> 00:37:32,802
and she'll disappear at your wife's concert.

517
00:37:40,542 --> 00:37:43,311
The culprit is Kim Jin Ho,

518
00:37:44,042 --> 00:37:45,852
a man who believes...

519
00:37:45,852 --> 00:37:47,711
his daughter died in a fire because of you.

520
00:37:48,322 --> 00:37:49,781
And because of that shock,

521
00:37:51,651 --> 00:37:53,251
your wife kills herself too.

522
00:37:54,352 --> 00:37:55,961
And I know this...

523
00:37:56,862 --> 00:37:58,832
because I've been in contact...

524
00:37:59,561 --> 00:38:02,031
with you in a month, in other words, you who's living in September.

525
00:38:02,031 --> 00:38:04,661
I'm currently living a month ahead of you.

526
00:38:05,832 --> 00:38:07,732
We have been in contact.

527
00:38:13,311 --> 00:38:15,142
Should I call the police or the 911?

528
00:38:17,242 --> 00:38:18,781
I need to call the police to report a crime,

529
00:38:19,612 --> 00:38:21,181
but if you need to see a doctor, would that be the 911?

530
00:38:23,352 --> 00:38:25,492
I know I'll sound like a lunatic,

531
00:38:26,191 --> 00:38:27,292
but please believe me.

532
00:38:27,292 --> 00:38:29,461
Will you leave before I make a report?

533
00:38:33,862 --> 00:38:36,832
"It's not because of you. It wasn't because of you, Da Bin."

534
00:38:42,172 --> 00:38:44,371
You always wanted to tell her that,

535
00:38:44,441 --> 00:38:46,012
but you never could.

536
00:38:48,112 --> 00:38:51,582
"Mom and Dad aren't fighting because of you, Da Bin."

537
00:38:52,052 --> 00:38:53,151
That's something...

538
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:56,281
you have to tell her.

539
00:38:58,191 --> 00:38:59,292
Who are you?

540
00:39:05,262 --> 00:39:06,931
How do you think I found out?

541
00:39:07,531 --> 00:39:10,262
You've never told anyone else that.

542
00:39:11,202 --> 00:39:13,471
I heard it from you, Mr. Kim.

543
00:39:15,772 --> 00:39:16,802
That hurts.

544
00:39:18,042 --> 00:39:19,642
Hey! My gosh!

545
00:39:21,742 --> 00:39:22,881
Man.

546
00:39:23,911 --> 00:39:24,982
My gosh.

547
00:39:26,211 --> 00:39:27,211
Darn it.

548
00:39:44,032 --> 00:39:47,302
Mr. Kim, you need to eat to live.

549
00:39:56,141 --> 00:39:58,552
(Gangil Police Station)

550
00:39:59,112 --> 00:40:01,722
- Mr. Park, where should we eat? - Wherever that's close by.

551
00:40:01,821 --> 00:40:03,951
We'll have our 10th coupon if we eat at Yujeong Diner.

552
00:40:03,951 --> 00:40:05,451
- Then let's eat there. - Yes, sir.

553
00:40:06,621 --> 00:40:09,222
- Did you get Kim Jin Ho some food? - There's no use.

554
00:40:09,761 --> 00:40:11,391
He starves himself all day long and won't even look at it.

555
00:40:11,391 --> 00:40:13,462
- Man. - That tenacious punk.

556
00:40:14,131 --> 00:40:16,701
We'll have some progress if he tells us where he threw her body.

557
00:40:16,701 --> 00:40:19,131
- Tell me about it. - He won't say a word...

558
00:40:19,131 --> 00:40:20,472
until Kim Seo Jin apologizes.

559
00:40:20,472 --> 00:40:23,271
Exactly. These days, if we mess with them even a little,

560
00:40:23,672 --> 00:40:24,771
it's considered cruel treatment.

561
00:40:26,042 --> 00:40:27,712
We should beat them up like we used to.

562
00:40:27,712 --> 00:40:30,581
Won't reporters bother us if we eat at Yujeong Diner?

563
00:40:30,581 --> 00:40:32,782
I took a look at the press room as I walked out,

564
00:40:32,782 --> 00:40:34,412
and they seemed to have ordered something.

565
00:40:35,052 --> 00:40:36,681
Is it because of Kim Seo Jin?

566
00:40:36,681 --> 00:40:38,152
You don't want bad press on their company.

567
00:40:38,751 --> 00:40:41,422
Keep your mouths shut until we check all the facts...

568
00:40:41,422 --> 00:40:42,621
and make an official report.

569
00:40:42,621 --> 00:40:44,061

It's even on the news.

583
00:41:22,102 --> 00:41:24,831
The high-profile case of the kidnapping of Kim Da Bin...

584
00:41:24,831 --> 00:41:26,871
has entered into a new phase.

585
00:41:27,001 --> 00:41:30,302
- Oh man. - The voice of the suspect, Kim,

586
00:41:30,302 --> 00:41:33,542
was found identical with the voice of the kidnapper,

587
00:41:33,612 --> 00:41:36,742
and Kim confessed the motive of his crime.

588
00:41:36,941 --> 00:41:38,511
- What's that? Turn up the volume. - Kim has said...

589
00:41:38,511 --> 00:41:40,782
he committed this crime because Kim Seo Jin,

590
00:41:40,782 --> 00:41:42,282
the director of Yujung Constructions,

591
00:41:42,282 --> 00:41:44,552
wouldn't listen to what he had to say.

592
00:41:44,821 --> 00:41:47,222
The suspect has lost his daughter back in May...

593
00:41:47,222 --> 00:41:48,462
in a fire of an amusement complex,

594
00:41:48,462 --> 00:41:49,962
and he has asserted...

595
00:41:49,962 --> 00:41:52,992
Yujung Constructions have been using illegal construction materials...

596
00:41:52,992 --> 00:41:54,391
that are vulnerable to fire.

597
00:41:54,492 --> 00:41:57,162
However, Yujung Constructions did not respond in any way,

598
00:41:57,162 --> 00:41:59,472
so he ended up kidnapping Kim Da Bin.

599
00:41:59,701 --> 00:42:01,672
Many civic groups are demanding...

600
00:42:01,672 --> 00:42:04,242
the police to hold a thorough investigation on the suspicion.

601
00:42:04,371 --> 00:42:07,871
Yujung Constructions did not show any actions at this point.

602
00:42:07,871 --> 00:42:10,141
But if the use of illegal materials turns out to be true,

603
00:42:10,141 --> 00:42:12,681
it'll take a toll on their image as a company that builds...

604
00:42:12,681 --> 00:42:14,381
- Wasn't there an embargo on this? - houses for people.

605
00:42:14,381 --> 00:42:15,982
Darn it. What happened?

606
00:42:16,352 --> 00:42:17,852
The police are investigating...

607
00:42:17,852 --> 00:42:20,222
to see if Kim had any other motives,

608
00:42:20,222 --> 00:42:22,321
and they will also conduct an investigation...

The patient who lied next to her gave them to us before discharging.

684
00:47:57,092 --> 00:47:58,891
Ms. Kwak had lent it to her and asked her to give it back...

before she got discharged,

686
00:48:00,092 --> 00:48:01,462
but she couldn't.

687
00:48:03,362 --> 00:48:04,401
I see.

00:48:04,531 --> 00:48:06,631

Ma'am.

691
00:48:13,342 --> 00:48:16,281
If my mom had told that patient to give this back later,

692
00:48:16,281 --> 00:48:18,651
it must've meant she wasn't planning to leave anytime soon.

693
00:48:19,812 --> 00:48:22,322
Did anyone visit her that day?

694
00:48:22,651 --> 00:48:24,521
Or did you hear anything?

695
00:48:25,722 --> 00:48:29,462
Well... We receive numerous visitors every day.

696
00:48:30,062 --> 00:48:31,161
I'm sorry.

697
00:48:32,092 --> 00:48:34,531
I understand. Goodbye.

698
00:48:52,312 --> 00:48:54,651
Wait a minute! One second!

699
00:48:57,822 --> 00:48:59,822
I'm not completely sure,

700
00:49:00,822 --> 00:49:03,192
but I did see a man roaming in front of her room.

701
00:49:04,761 --> 00:49:06,391
There are times when religious groups...

702
00:49:06,391 --> 00:49:08,801
or solicitors come without any permission.

703
00:49:09,531 --> 00:49:10,901
May I help you?

704
00:49:11,432 --> 00:49:13,702
He said his relative was hospitalized.

705
00:49:13,702 --> 00:49:15,871
He couldn't reach them and had forgotten which room it was.

706
00:49:15,972 --> 00:49:18,771
He thought he could find them easily since they had a rare surname.

707
00:49:19,511 --> 00:49:22,541
I believe he was looking for Ms. Kwak Song Ja.

708
00:49:22,942 --> 00:49:24,212
I finally remembered.

709
00:49:26,112 --> 00:49:28,011
Do you remember what he was wearing?

710
00:49:28,411 --> 00:49:29,952
He looked like he was in his 40s.

711
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:32,651
He looked like an average man.

712
00:49:33,651 --> 00:49:36,921
I think that was the day Ms. Kwak disappeared.

713
00:49:38,261 --> 00:49:39,291
Well...

714
00:49:39,932 --> 00:49:41,492
Is there anything else you remember?

715
00:49:42,401 --> 00:49:44,031
Anything would help.

716
00:49:44,501 --> 00:49:45,871
No, this is everything.

717
00:49:53,541 --> 00:49:56,182
Ma'am, could you help me out?

719

You came just in time.

720
00:50:01,511 --> 00:50:02,621
Thank you.

721
00:50:02,621 --> 00:50:04,352
Ward 15, was it?

722
00:50:04,421 --> 00:50:05,452
Yes.

723
00:50:06,952 --> 00:50:08,921
Can you slow down from here?

724
00:50:11,791 --> 00:50:12,932
Here.

725
00:50:13,291 --> 00:50:14,432
Was it him?

726
00:50:14,862 --> 00:50:16,102
Yes, it was.

727
00:50:21,572 --> 00:50:22,641
Wait.

728
00:50:23,342 --> 00:50:26,171

730
00:51:25,547 --> 00:51:26,618
Sir.

731
00:51:29,694 --> 00:51:30,995
Hey.

732
00:51:32,135 --> 00:51:34,064
I should've reported to you at work.

733
00:51:34,334 --> 00:51:36,865
I've been going through a lot. I'm sorry.

734
00:51:36,934 --> 00:51:38,005
Don't be.

735
00:51:38,775 --> 00:51:40,834
I just stopped by on my way home.

736
00:51:40,974 --> 00:51:42,304
Don't feel bad.

737
00:51:45,204 --> 00:51:46,615
Mr. Kim Jin Ho's claims...

738
00:51:47,714 --> 00:51:49,214
have absolutely no grounds.

739
00:51:49,515 --> 00:51:51,615
The news will die down soon.

740
00:51:52,285 --> 00:51:54,115
You don't have to worry about the ongoing project...

741
00:51:54,115 --> 00:51:55,214
while I'm gone for the month.

742
00:51:55,385 --> 00:51:57,554
I've already established a stable working schedule.

743
00:51:57,655 --> 00:51:58,794
We can definitely achieve...

744
00:51:58,794 --> 00:52:01,094
- the monthly goal. - Just think of this as bad luck.

745
00:52:02,794 --> 00:52:06,094
This didn't happen because of your shortcomings.

746
00:52:06,594 --> 00:52:09,505
In life, there are times when you experience such things...

747
00:52:09,505 --> 00:52:11,265
out of the blue.

748
00:52:12,334 --> 00:52:14,505
They'll leave scars on you.

749
00:52:15,235 --> 00:52:17,375
But in time, they'll become less painful.

750
00:52:18,875 --> 00:52:22,014
I will make sure to repay you for your kindness.

751
00:52:22,214 --> 00:52:23,944
I'm not being kind.

752
00:52:23,944 --> 00:52:24,944
I'm a businessman.

753
00:52:24,944 --> 00:52:26,415
I don't do anything that'll harm my business.

754
00:52:26,855 --> 00:52:29,855
For now, keeping you by my side will benefit me.

755
00:52:30,254 --> 00:52:31,325
Yes, sir.

756
00:52:31,784 --> 00:52:35,424
By the way, what about your wife's funeral?

757
00:52:36,395 --> 00:52:37,724
She's still missing, right?

758
00:52:38,724 --> 00:52:41,494
Can a funeral not take place if there's no body?

759
00:52:42,764 --> 00:52:43,835
I will...

760
00:52:45,365 --> 00:52:46,934
put everything back in its place.

761
00:52:48,974 --> 00:52:51,704
It's incredible how you've not gone insane.

762
00:52:52,774 --> 00:52:54,674
Let me know if you need anything.

763
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:56,714
Yes, sir.

764
00:53:09,924 --> 00:53:10,994
Shine the light over there.

765
00:53:13,395 --> 00:53:14,734
Search thoroughly.

766
00:53:17,734 --> 00:53:19,004
Be careful.

767
00:53:20,504 --> 00:53:22,944
- Look over there. - Yes, sir.

768
00:53:29,045 --> 00:53:31,145
We've found nothing. We should go farther in.

769
00:53:31,714 --> 00:53:33,315
- Do that. - Yes, sir.

770
00:53:34,585 --> 00:53:35,724
We've found something!

771
00:54:08,655 --> 00:54:09,825
Yes, Mr. Park.

772
00:54:10,085 --> 00:54:13,494
Kim Jin Ho confessed the location of the body.

773
00:54:15,964 --> 00:54:18,424
Where is it? I'll be right there.

774
00:54:19,494 --> 00:54:20,635
I think we found...

775
00:54:21,964 --> 00:54:23,504
Da Bin's belongings.

776
00:54:24,034 --> 00:54:27,204
We won't know for certain until the lab conducts its tests,

777
00:54:28,135 --> 00:54:31,045
but we found the clothes she was wearing that day...

778
00:54:32,415 --> 00:54:33,615
and the stuffed animal she had.

779
00:54:47,625 --> 00:54:49,165
I'm afraid the search is a bust.

780
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:52,494
If only it didn't rain a couple of days ago.

781
00:54:53,895 --> 00:54:55,764
Also, it's a body of a little girl.

782
00:54:57,234 --> 00:54:59,274
We should still search down the river.

783
00:55:00,434 --> 00:55:03,174
Continue the search once day breaks tomorrow.

784
00:55:03,474 --> 00:55:04,474
Got it.

785
00:55:20,454 --> 00:55:21,524
Honey.

786
00:55:24,295 --> 00:55:25,795
What do we do now?

787
00:55:29,905 --> 00:55:31,105

788
00:55:34,805 --> 00:55:37,004

790
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:13,774
Hello, Mr. Kim?

791
00:56:14,174 --> 00:56:16,244
Who on earth is this Kim Jin Ho?

792
00:56:16,885 --> 00:56:18,444
- Sorry? - He came to see my mom...

793
00:56:18,444 --> 00:56:19,454
at the hospital.

794
00:56:19,754 --> 00:56:21,915
The day she disappeared from the hospital.

795
00:56:22,385 --> 00:56:23,924
I must meet him.

796
00:56:24,454 --> 00:56:26,095
Does he live at the address you texted to me?

797
00:56:26,095 --> 00:56:27,125
Hold on a second.

798
00:56:27,924 --> 00:56:31,565
Kim Jin Ho went to see your mother at the hospital?

799
00:56:31,865 --> 00:56:34,295
I'm sure of it. I even checked the security footage.

800
00:56:34,494 --> 00:56:37,905
Why though? Why did he seek your mom out?

801
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:41,135
I'm just as clueless as you are.

802
00:56:42,405 --> 00:56:45,345
You from my timeline might know why.

803
00:56:45,815 --> 00:56:48,545
I'll make sure to meet you tomorrow.

804
00:56:48,815 --> 00:56:51,244
My mom disappeared right after Kim Jin Ho came to see her.

805
00:56:51,585 --> 00:56:54,885
Finding him will lead to my mom.

806
00:57:14,004 --> 00:57:15,204
Is anyone home?

807
00:57:16,744 --> 00:57:17,744

808
00:57:31,254 --> 00:57:33,424

Excuse me. I was hoping you could help me.

812
00:57:59,355 --> 00:58:02,214
It's regarding the residence at 1-4 Hangil-ro.

813
00:58:02,885 --> 00:58:04,524
Right. Are you house-hunting?

814
00:58:05,055 --> 00:58:08,555
What? That's not it. I'm looking for its resident.

815
00:58:10,065 --> 00:58:12,464
The house is on the market. It's probably empty.

816
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:15,135
Did the old residents move out then?

817
00:58:15,135 --> 00:58:16,534
That's not something we'd know.

818
00:58:17,764 --> 00:58:19,434

819
00:58:20,835 --> 00:58:22,204
Sorry, I'm drawing a blank.

820
00:58:23,575 --> 00:58:25,004

821
00:58:27,915 --> 00:58:29,214
Yes, Mr. Park.

822
00:58:34,315 --> 00:58:36,855

823
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:39,724

He'll be prosecuted, of course.

For this and the murder of Han Ae Ri.

835

What? Who did you just say?

836
00:59:48,954 --> 00:59:51,724
The news only called it the Shinhyeon-dong Murder,

837
00:59:52,994 --> 00:59:54,635
but Han Ae Ri was the victim.

844
01:00:17,454 --> 01:00:18,524
Yes, it's most likely.

846
01:00:21,724 --> 01:00:24,924
