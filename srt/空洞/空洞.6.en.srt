Ms. Han?

3
00:00:37,453 --> 00:00:40,124
Mr. Kim, I sent you some information on my dad. Did you get it?

(Messages)

00:00:42,194 --> 00:00:44,864
(His name is Han Tae Gil. If he used to work at Yujung Constructions...)

6
00:00:44,864 --> 00:00:45,963
Yes, I got it.

7
00:00:46,194 --> 00:00:48,734
What about Mr. Lee Taek Gyu? Have you looked into him?

8
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,651
I was actually tailing him...

9
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,321
and found a dead person.

10
00:00:57,961 --> 00:00:59,060
What?

11
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,391
Whose body is it?

12
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:03,761
He killed them?

13
00:01:03,761 --> 00:01:06,401
I don't know who this person is.

14
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,670
I can't see the face clearly.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,901
I'm at an abandoned house in the countryside.

16
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,810
I don't know how he knows about this place...

17
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,080
or who the dead person is.

18
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,810
Mr. Kim, I think you should get out of there right now.

19
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,381
I'll look into your dad and let you know.

20
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,661
You've called 112 emergency.

21
00:02:39,221 --> 00:02:40,561
There's a dead body here.

22
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,091
I'm at...

The vehicle you're tracking is in a 60m radius.

26
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:05,541
The vehicle you're tracking is in a 5m radius.

27

The vehicle you're tracking is in a 1m radius.

The vehicle you're tracking is in a 1m radius.

29
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:08,970
Hey, Mr. Lee.

30
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,481
Director Kim had bugged my vehicle.

31
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,481
Thankfully, I noticed it quickly and got rid of it.

32
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:17,580
So? Did he see something?

33
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,321
There's a dead body here.

34
00:05:21,191 --> 00:05:22,450
I'm at...

35
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:25,390
Samgok-myeon, Illju-gun, Gyeonggi Province.

36
00:05:28,231 --> 00:05:29,431
He didn't see anything.

37
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,600
You said that Han Ae Ri...

38
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,200
saw your face back at Kim Jin Ho's place, right?

39
00:05:34,261 --> 00:05:36,231
- Yes. - Lie low for the time being.

40
00:05:36,631 --> 00:05:38,270
Don't come to work either.

41
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,871
Yes, sir.

42
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,571
By the way, what should I do with Kim Jin Ho?

43
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:46,910
I'll call you back.

44
00:05:47,311 --> 00:05:48,311
Yes, sir.

45
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,020
- Mom. - Yes?

46
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,890
When are we...

47
00:06:03,691 --> 00:06:05,631
going back home?

48
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,270
Do you not like it here?

49
00:06:09,571 --> 00:06:11,270
I do,

50
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,200
but I miss Dad.

51
00:06:14,671 --> 00:06:18,210
Can't you tell him to come here?

52
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:22,280
Da Bin.

53
00:06:23,981 --> 00:06:26,751
All I need is you.

54
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:28,590
Is that not the case for you?

55
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,720
I won't throw a tantrum.

56
00:06:33,821 --> 00:06:34,931
Okay.

57
00:06:35,131 --> 00:06:38,131
Just do as I say.

58
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,231
And I'll make you...

59
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,131
the happiest girl in the world.

60
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,970
Okay? Now, go to bed.

61
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,801
Is Da Bin sleeping?

62
00:07:13,061 --> 00:07:14,330
Yes.

63
00:07:19,001 --> 00:07:21,140
I wish to leave the country with you as soon as possible.

64
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,061
Don't worry about anything.

65
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,061
I can solve them all.

66
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,001
You should go home.

67
00:07:50,131 --> 00:07:53,100

(Haeshin Branch Manager Kim Jun Seob)

72
00:08:43,351 --> 00:08:44,420
Hello?

73
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,030
Hello, this is Kim Seo Jin from Yujung Constructions.

74
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:50,091
Goodness, Director Kim. How may I help you?

75
00:08:51,091 --> 00:08:53,800
I read that you cleared your name. You must've gone through a lot.

76
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,440
Right. Due to an urgent request, I had to call you at this hour.

77
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,741
Could you tell me who the account belongs to...

78
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:02,810
if I were to give you Haeshin's bank account number?

79
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,140
What is this concerning?

80
00:09:07,341 --> 00:09:08,851
I know this is a sensitive favour.

81
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:12,721
It's an urgent personal matter, so please help me out, sir.

82
00:09:12,881 --> 00:09:15,920
It's a bit difficult to do that because the Privacy Act...

83
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,251
had been strengthened.

84
00:09:17,951 --> 00:09:20,560
But since it's you, I should help out.

85
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,591
Text me the account number, and I'll call you back tomorrow.

86
00:09:23,861 --> 00:09:25,131
Thank you.

87
00:09:27,201 --> 00:09:29,101
If he used to work at Yujung Constructions,

88
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,170
shouldn't there be a record of it?

89
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,640
Could you look into it?

90
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,140
His name is Han Tae Gil.

91
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,940
His resident registration number is...

(Year)

93
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:47,951

He and Mr. Seo...

99
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,150
knew each other.

100
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,361
(Keep the restrooms clean.)

101
00:11:22,247 --> 00:11:23,647
- Hello? - Mr. Kim,

102
00:11:23,647 --> 00:11:25,217
this is the Chairman's office.

103
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:28,387
I called to confirm your lunch with Chairman Yu.

104
00:11:30,087 --> 00:11:31,326
Noted.

105
00:11:45,637 --> 00:11:46,837
This is Kim Seo Jin.

106
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,706
Yes, sir.

107
00:11:48,946 --> 00:11:51,446
Our database goes up to only 2005.

108
00:11:51,446 --> 00:11:53,377
How can I get the files...

109
00:11:53,517 --> 00:11:56,046
on an employee of ours who worked here in 2001?

110
00:11:56,387 --> 00:11:59,757
I'm afraid only the files dated back to 2005...

111
00:12:00,017 --> 00:12:01,587
have been put into the system.

112
00:12:01,826 --> 00:12:03,956
The older documents are still waiting to be sorted out,

113
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:06,196
so it'll be nearly impossible for you to go through them.

114
00:12:06,296 --> 00:12:07,727
Do we at least have the files?

115
00:12:08,296 --> 00:12:09,727
There's someone I need to look up.

116
00:12:09,727 --> 00:12:12,397
Then we'll get what we can for you...

117
00:12:12,397 --> 00:12:14,637
so that you can go through them.

118
00:12:14,637 --> 00:12:15,906
Sure thing.

119
00:12:16,406 --> 00:12:18,036
But they're best friends.

120
00:12:18,107 --> 00:12:19,837
- Exactly. - Tell me about it.

121
00:12:19,837 --> 00:12:22,546
- It's why we can't go elsewhere. - Same here...

122
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:24,276
Honey, here's your dinner.

123
00:12:24,747 --> 00:12:26,347
Your meal,

124
00:12:26,776 --> 00:12:29,186
some fruit, and ice cream.

125
00:12:30,087 --> 00:12:33,717
Ice cream, yes! Would you like some too?

126
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,426
Hold on. What kind of ice cream would you like?

127
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:40,426
- What's your favourite flavour? - Mommy's a Monster.

128
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,267
- This, and... - Alice in Wonderland.

129
00:12:43,397 --> 00:12:44,597
That's...

130
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:46,536
my friend's favourite.

131
00:12:46,897 --> 00:12:48,936
Sure thing. Alice in Wonderland coming up.

132
00:12:50,406 --> 00:12:51,936
Which flavour do you like?

133
00:12:51,936 --> 00:12:55,607
Any flavour you like is good enough for me.

134
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:58,816
One heap of ice cream coming up!

135
00:13:03,147 --> 00:13:04,217
Da Bin,

136
00:13:05,286 --> 00:13:07,387
you seem like the sweetest kid.

137
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:11,897
- Why's that? - You got some for your sibling too.

138
00:13:12,757 --> 00:13:15,166
How did you know it was my sibling?

139
00:13:15,997 --> 00:13:17,796
Just so you know though,

140
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:20,237
it's way nicer than I am.

141
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:21,906
Really?

142
00:13:22,637 --> 00:13:25,337
It listens to everything I have to say.

143
00:13:26,477 --> 00:13:28,406
When my parents are busy,

144
00:13:28,406 --> 00:13:30,946
I never get bored thanks to it.

145
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,147
And when I'm scared,

146
00:13:33,347 --> 00:13:36,946
hugging it makes everything okay.

147
00:13:41,656 --> 00:13:44,987
Then you must take it with you...

148
00:13:45,056 --> 00:13:46,997
everywhere you go.

149
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,227
What a loyal sibling you have.

150
00:13:50,926 --> 00:13:53,267
I must give it a reward next time.

151
00:13:55,036 --> 00:13:56,306
That's right.

152
00:14:03,706 --> 00:14:05,647
Then he should attach a tracker on her...

153
00:14:05,647 --> 00:14:06,946
and download the lost child prevention app.

154
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,887
That way, he'll be able to find her even if she gets kidnapped.

155
00:14:08,987 --> 00:14:11,117
I'll get a tracker for you.

156
00:14:11,956 --> 00:14:16,857
(More, Photo, Video)

157
00:14:39,977 --> 00:14:41,076
Kim Jin Ho thinks...

158
00:14:41,477 --> 00:14:44,117
his daughter died because of you.

159
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,717
So he's coming up with a plan to kidnap Da Bin.

160
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,536
You seem busy these days.

161
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:04,906
I have people to hire.

162
00:15:05,676 --> 00:15:07,206
Today, I met with an undertaker.

163
00:15:08,276 --> 00:15:11,546
This guy has connections to orphanages and welfare facilities.

164
00:15:12,117 --> 00:15:14,117
According to this guy, bodies of young kids come in often.

165
00:15:14,977 --> 00:15:16,147
The guy agreed to first provide us...

166
00:15:16,147 --> 00:15:17,286
with a strand of hair with its root intact.

167
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:21,556
One from a kid that matches Da Bin's physical description.

168
00:15:27,857 --> 00:15:29,666
Once the DNA from the hair and the severed finger...

169
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,467
come back as a match,

170
00:15:33,737 --> 00:15:34,897
it'll all be over.

171
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:45,647
It'll all go well, so put your faith in me.

172
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,316
You did great.

173
00:15:56,526 --> 00:15:58,897
I even secured a place for you and Da Bin.

174
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:01,097
I hope she likes it though.

175
00:16:01,326 --> 00:16:02,627
Will she be able to adjust?

176
00:16:02,997 --> 00:16:05,066
She gets her smarts from me, you know.

177
00:16:05,696 --> 00:16:06,696
And those with high intelligence...

178
00:16:06,696 --> 00:16:08,867
tend to easily adjust to new environments.

179
00:16:09,306 --> 00:16:10,406
Moreover,

180
00:16:11,066 --> 00:16:13,477
she can only be happy if I am.

181
00:16:21,117 --> 00:16:22,387
Same here.

182
00:16:23,647 --> 00:16:27,416
I want to be rid of the name Kang Hyun Chae as soon as possible.

183
00:16:32,727 --> 00:16:34,826
It's been a long desire of mine.

184
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:44,967
To us, the Netherlands is famous for its windmills.

185
00:16:45,206 --> 00:16:48,036
In this episode, we'll be going over...

186
00:16:48,036 --> 00:16:51,076
its industry, trade, and scientific development.

187
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:53,316
At first, you'll notice...

188
00:16:53,316 --> 00:16:56,046
the buildings in the shape of droplets.

189
00:16:56,387 --> 00:16:58,487
As a country that's known...

190
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:00,757
to manage its water well,

191
00:17:00,757 --> 00:17:02,887
the buildings symbolize its use of water...

192
00:17:18,206 --> 00:17:21,277
By coming up with innovative ideas,

193
00:17:21,277 --> 00:17:24,676
its goal is to achieve...

194
00:17:24,946 --> 00:17:27,246
an environment-friendly technology in collaboration with our country.

195
00:17:33,087 --> 00:17:36,057
Help. The door won't budge!

196
00:17:36,287 --> 00:17:37,587
Please open the door!

197
00:17:46,696 --> 00:17:49,406
No!

198
00:17:55,476 --> 00:17:57,506
- Mr. Kim Seo Jin? - Here.

199
00:18:02,817 --> 00:18:04,617
I'll prescribe something for your anxieties.

200
00:18:04,887 --> 00:18:06,216
How about your usual pills?

201
00:18:06,716 --> 00:18:09,726
Could you perhaps prescribe something stronger?

202
00:18:10,057 --> 00:18:11,357
The insomnia has gotten worse.

203
00:18:27,037 --> 00:18:28,637
Mr. Kim, you're here.

204
00:18:32,716 --> 00:18:34,516
I see you're both here.

205
00:18:35,787 --> 00:18:36,946
Have a seat.

206
00:18:38,246 --> 00:18:39,756
You did well, Seo Jin.

207
00:18:40,656 --> 00:18:43,627
Do Kyun, you also did well in his absence as well.

208
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:45,287
Let's sit.

209
00:18:51,367 --> 00:18:52,597
Welcome.

210
00:18:53,367 --> 00:18:56,307
I'm sorry, but can I use the restroom?

211
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:57,736
The restroom?

212
00:19:02,506 --> 00:19:05,107
You'll need this key. Please follow me.

213
00:19:10,387 --> 00:19:13,287
It's before the parking lot just around the corner.

214
00:19:13,287 --> 00:19:14,317
Thanks.

215
00:19:52,696 --> 00:19:55,397
Seo Jin, we'll wait for the right time to bring you back in.

216
00:19:56,766 --> 00:19:59,037
Considering what happened to your wife and child,

217
00:19:59,496 --> 00:20:03,006
you should get all the time you need.

218
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:07,537
It's not something one can easily bounce back from.

219
00:20:08,377 --> 00:20:10,377
Think of the collapse at Taejung City.

220
00:20:11,147 --> 00:20:13,777
Not everyone experiences trauma like that either.

221
00:20:14,617 --> 00:20:18,147
Life has been exceptionally cruel to Seo Jin.

222
00:20:21,956 --> 00:20:23,057
Even if that's the case,

223
00:20:23,057 --> 00:20:25,597
the higher the mountain, the deeper the valley.

224
00:20:26,027 --> 00:20:28,196
The deeper your trials try to put you down,

225
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:30,867
the higher up you'll climb, more than anyone else.

226
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:32,337
I'm flattered.

227
00:20:32,837 --> 00:20:34,496
So while we're on this topic,

228
00:20:35,766 --> 00:20:37,406
let Mr. Seo take over...

229
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:39,936
your current project and finish it.

230
00:20:40,137 --> 00:20:43,746
Once you return, why don't you take the project for Taejung City?

231
00:20:45,107 --> 00:20:47,446
It seems like perfect timing for you to return.

232
00:20:48,516 --> 00:20:50,347
But Director Park is already in charge.

233
00:20:50,347 --> 00:20:53,787
This project will decide Yujung's fate for the next decade.

234
00:20:54,756 --> 00:20:56,027
You'll take over, Seo Jin.

235
00:20:58,357 --> 00:20:59,557
In many aspects,

236
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,496
you're a perfect candidate for the project.

237
00:21:03,226 --> 00:21:04,726
Congratulations, Mr. Kim.

238
00:21:04,996 --> 00:21:06,666
It's too early to celebrate.

239
00:21:20,253 --> 00:21:23,553
Mr. Kim, are you heading home? Let me escort you back.

240
00:21:23,852 --> 00:21:25,562
I'm fine. I drove myself.

241
00:21:26,062 --> 00:21:27,993
Then please return safely.

242
00:21:29,062 --> 00:21:31,993
Wait, has Mr. Lee gone somewhere else?

243
00:21:33,562 --> 00:21:35,203
Why are you looking for him?

244
00:21:35,572 --> 00:21:38,033
I called him last time because I left something in the office,

245
00:21:38,572 --> 00:21:39,703
but I couldn't reach him.

246
00:21:40,003 --> 00:21:41,503
I heard he's on a leave.

247
00:21:43,243 --> 00:21:44,912
You two were already acquainted...

248
00:21:45,983 --> 00:21:47,513
before his first day here, right?

249
00:21:48,812 --> 00:21:50,852
Mr. Lee and I are from the same hometown,

250
00:21:50,983 --> 00:21:52,822
but we weren't previously acquainted.

251
00:21:52,822 --> 00:21:55,693
Didn't you recommend him when he got a job here?

252
00:22:00,322 --> 00:22:03,662
An elderly man from my hometown called me around when he started.

253
00:22:04,092 --> 00:22:07,102
He said Mr. Lee is my high school junior who applied for a job here.

254
00:22:07,862 --> 00:22:10,973
He asked me to help him get in by recommending him as an employee.

255
00:22:13,043 --> 00:22:14,973
I see. You may go.

256
00:22:15,102 --> 00:22:17,812
Mr. Kim, if you left something in your office,

257
00:22:17,812 --> 00:22:19,312
I'll pick it up for you.

258
00:22:19,642 --> 00:22:21,683
No, it's fine. I'll get going.

259
00:22:38,193 --> 00:22:39,433
Yes, Mr. Kim.

260
00:22:39,503 --> 00:22:42,162
You asked for the number of the account holder yesterday,

261
00:22:42,372 --> 00:22:43,872
and I just texted it to you.

262
00:22:45,332 --> 00:22:46,902
I got your text. Thank you.

263
00:22:46,902 --> 00:22:49,043
Don't mention it. Let me buy you a meal soon.

264
00:22:49,342 --> 00:22:51,072
I heard you'll be returning to the office soon.

265
00:22:51,443 --> 00:22:54,312
I should treat you to a meal. I'll give you a call.

266
00:22:56,453 --> 00:22:58,412
(This is Mr. Kim Han Cheol's number.)

267
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:09,293
Hello?

268
00:23:09,493 --> 00:23:11,233
I called to see if I could ask you a question.

269
00:23:11,832 --> 00:23:14,963
Did you recently receive money in your Haeshin Bank account?

270
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,332
Haeshin Bank?

271
00:23:17,072 --> 00:23:18,632
Are you calling form the bank?

272
00:23:18,703 --> 00:23:21,842
No, actually, I'm looking for my close relative.

273
00:23:22,372 --> 00:23:25,443
She's quite sick, but she cut off contact with her family.

274
00:23:26,513 --> 00:23:29,983
She was recently asked to send money to your account, so I wondered if...

275
00:23:29,983 --> 00:23:32,322
You mean, Ms. Kwak Song Ja?

276
00:23:32,683 --> 00:23:34,422
Are you looking for her?

277
00:23:45,703 --> 00:23:48,132
What did you just say?

278
00:23:48,763 --> 00:23:50,733
I asked if you're looking for Ms. Kwak Song Ja.

279
00:23:51,003 --> 00:23:54,372
That's the most recent transfer I got in my Haeshin Bank account.

280
00:23:55,743 --> 00:23:56,912
Thank you, sir.

281
00:24:02,513 --> 00:24:04,483

00:24:23,572 --> 00:24:24,933
Why did it have to be Kwak Song Ja?

286
00:24:30,713 --> 00:24:31,973
Ms. Han Ae Ri...

00:24:50,892 --> 00:24:52,832

289
00:25:02,412 --> 00:25:03,513
Right here.

290
00:25:05,142 --> 00:25:07,082
I'm sorry, ma'am.

291
00:25:07,213 --> 00:25:09,112
The laws for the Privacy Act has been reinforced,

292
00:25:09,283 --> 00:25:12,553
so I cannot tell a third party who sent you that money.

293
00:25:13,822 --> 00:25:16,122
You can check. I'm Kwak Song Ja's daughter.

294
00:25:16,122 --> 00:25:19,223
I understand you're her family, but we can only let her know.

295
00:25:19,463 --> 00:25:21,592
I think something happened to her. That's why.

296
00:25:22,463 --> 00:25:23,963
Please help me.

297
00:25:24,132 --> 00:25:26,362
In that case, I think you're better off...

298
00:25:26,362 --> 00:25:28,233
asking the police for help.

299
00:25:29,102 --> 00:25:31,832
There's nothing we can tell you.

300
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:36,872
Ae Ri.

301
00:25:37,642 --> 00:25:40,713
Ae Ri! What were you notified of?

302
00:25:41,213 --> 00:25:42,283
Is this bad?

303
00:25:43,183 --> 00:25:44,683
I received an odd text.

304
00:25:45,082 --> 00:25:46,183
What message?

305
00:25:47,382 --> 00:25:48,723
How does this make any sense?

306
00:25:49,352 --> 00:25:50,453
What's this?

307
00:25:50,753 --> 00:25:52,223
How many zeroes are there?

308
00:25:52,223 --> 00:25:54,062
Someone sent 100,000 dollars to Mom.

309
00:25:54,162 --> 00:25:56,193
How would she find so much money?

310
00:25:57,033 --> 00:25:59,033
What if something happened to her?

311
00:25:59,033 --> 00:26:01,902
Let's... Let's calm down and think about this.

312
00:26:02,872 --> 00:26:05,433
Someone you weren't aware of might have owed her money,

313
00:26:06,142 --> 00:26:07,842
or she might have had some land.

314
00:26:09,142 --> 00:26:10,473
Give it a thought.

315
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:13,543
You already know our financial situation.

316
00:26:13,783 --> 00:26:16,912
I had to work 2, 3 jobs to make money for her surgery,

317
00:26:17,082 --> 00:26:18,783
and she always felt bad about it.

318
00:26:20,122 --> 00:26:22,723
She even said she feels guilty to be a poor and sick parent.

319
00:26:23,422 --> 00:26:24,723
I have a feeling...

320
00:26:27,362 --> 00:26:29,233
that this money has to be ominous.

Hey, is something going on?

Today, a huge amount of money got transferred to Ms. Kwak's account.

- What's it for? - That's what we don't know.

341
00:27:52,013 --> 00:27:53,483

Hey, are you serious?

346

00:28:36,453 --> 00:28:38,723
Then before she got to that place,

359
00:28:38,993 --> 00:28:41,092
do you know that restaurant where she stayed at?

360
00:28:41,223 --> 00:28:43,632
I think I heard something through another person.

361
00:28:44,693 --> 00:28:48,203
Something like a marketplace near Yeongwon Farm.

362
00:28:48,562 --> 00:28:49,872
Yeongwon Farm.

363
00:29:02,912 --> 00:29:04,053
Hello?

364
00:29:05,013 --> 00:29:06,322
Yes, you're the police?

365
00:29:08,082 --> 00:29:10,523
What? Ms. Kwak did what?

366
00:29:13,993 --> 00:29:15,322
Hello.

367
00:29:15,892 --> 00:29:17,162
- I'm looking for someone. - Sure.

368
00:29:17,162 --> 00:29:18,862
Have you seen this woman?

369
00:29:19,433 --> 00:29:20,763
I don't think so.

370
00:29:24,503 --> 00:29:27,273
Excuse me, have you seen this woman?

371
00:29:27,273 --> 00:29:28,743
No, I haven't.

372
00:29:30,443 --> 00:29:32,473
(Haejangchon)

373
00:29:32,543 --> 00:29:35,183
It has always been like that, man.

374
00:29:35,443 --> 00:29:36,652
Hello.

375
00:29:36,852 --> 00:29:38,713
Excuse me, I'm looking for someone.

376
00:29:38,713 --> 00:29:41,422
- Have you seen this woman? - I'm not sure.

377
00:29:41,422 --> 00:29:43,422
I'm sorry, but could you take a closer look?

378
00:29:46,322 --> 00:29:47,963
- Excuse me, sir. - Yes?

379
00:29:47,963 --> 00:29:51,033
She's quite sick. I'll come back later to ask,

380
00:29:51,562 --> 00:29:53,203
so please remember what she looks like.

381
00:30:30,303 --> 00:30:31,433
(Han Ae Ri)

382
00:30:31,533 --> 00:30:34,602
Hello? Mr. Kim, did you look into my dad?

383
00:30:34,872 --> 00:30:36,473
Did he work at Yujung Constructions?

384
00:30:36,473 --> 00:30:39,412
I couldn't find him on our database, so I asked HR for information.

385
00:30:39,642 --> 00:30:41,713
But if he worked with a subcontractor,

386
00:30:41,713 --> 00:30:43,253
it might be tough to find more information.

387
00:30:43,483 --> 00:30:44,483
I see.

388
00:30:45,612 --> 00:30:48,422
Most of the casualties were construction workers on site,

389
00:30:48,983 --> 00:30:50,392
so that might be the case.

390
00:30:51,793 --> 00:30:54,693
If you find any new information, please let me know.

391
00:30:56,493 --> 00:30:57,993
What happened yesterday?

392
00:30:59,433 --> 00:31:02,773
Lee Taek Gyu is the murderer, right? So who died?

393
00:31:05,733 --> 00:31:06,803
Hello?

394
00:31:07,803 --> 00:31:09,842
- Mr. Kim. - I couldn't find...

395
00:31:11,743 --> 00:31:13,213
the identity of the dead person.

396
00:31:17,112 --> 00:31:18,213
Actually,

397
00:31:19,523 --> 00:31:22,852
Someone transferred a huge amount of money to my mom's bank account.

398
00:31:24,152 --> 00:31:25,993
Who sent it to her?

399
00:31:26,193 --> 00:31:28,562
No one can get that information other than the account holder.

400
00:31:29,263 --> 00:31:30,763
Something doesn't feel right.

401
00:31:32,092 --> 00:31:34,533
Give me the account number. I might be able to find out.

402
00:31:34,662 --> 00:31:35,803
Don't worry.

403
00:31:35,933 --> 00:31:39,102
I'll make sure I find her.

404
00:31:40,003 --> 00:31:42,402
I need to know that to be more at peace.

405
00:31:43,312 --> 00:31:44,513
Please do that.

406
00:31:44,642 --> 00:31:45,743
Ms. Han.

407
00:31:47,713 --> 00:31:49,082
I need to tell you something.

408
00:31:51,213 --> 00:31:52,352
What is it?

409
00:31:54,253 --> 00:31:57,892
I was there when Taejung Town collapsed.

410
00:32:00,862 --> 00:32:01,892
What?

411
00:32:02,062 --> 00:32:03,862
I was the last survivor...

412
00:32:06,463 --> 00:32:08,362
who was rescued from that accident.

413
00:32:36,293 --> 00:32:38,332
(Rescued After 31 Days of the Taejung Town Collapse")

414
00:32:38,332 --> 00:32:40,332
(The 19-year-old Kim Survives Miraculously)

415
00:32:51,312 --> 00:32:53,582
Ever since my mom went missing,

416
00:32:54,342 --> 00:32:58,453
I felt like I've been walking through a dark tunnel every day,

417
00:33:01,053 --> 00:33:04,622
thinking, "Will this ever end?"

418
00:33:06,293 --> 00:33:07,892
Whenever I'm overtaken with doubt,

419
00:33:09,763 --> 00:33:11,562
I'll think of you, Mr. Kim.

420
00:33:12,592 --> 00:33:13,933
When everything ends,

421
00:33:15,862 --> 00:33:18,503
let us meet just as you suggested.

422
00:33:18,503 --> 00:33:20,473
(When everything ends, let us meet just as you suggested.)

423
00:33:26,342 --> 00:33:30,112
(Part 2 will air soon.)

424
00:34:06,151 --> 00:34:08,321
Ji Ah, look at me.

425
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,351
Is it too tough to breathe?

426
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,761
Let me rub your back.

427
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,331
Why not? Don't you want me to?

428
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,230
Is anybody home?

429
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,401
Who is it?

430
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,041
One second.

431
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:42,590
Hello, sir. I'm from Yujung Constructions.

432
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:46,420
I'm very sorry about what happened last time.

433
00:34:47,021 --> 00:34:48,890
Are you hurt in any way?

434
00:34:48,931 --> 00:34:51,961
Why are you here? Make it quick, then leave.

435
00:34:53,431 --> 00:34:55,200
May I see your daughter first?

436
00:34:59,941 --> 00:35:01,571
Sure. Come in.

437
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:21,220
Ji Ah, let me bring you some water.

438
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:35,011
(Medicine: Kim Ji Ah)

439
00:35:35,011 --> 00:35:36,810
(Medicine: Kim Jin Ho)

440
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:51,990
So? What are you here to say?

441
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:58,501
I'm sure you looked into it, but there are customs in the industry.

442
00:35:59,501 --> 00:36:01,830
Mr. Kim Seo Jin is the man in charge of the amusement complex.

443
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:05,441
And we must do things as we're told to make a living.

444
00:36:05,871 --> 00:36:09,441
Yes, exactly. So get the man in charge here.

445
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,610
But I found out something new.

446
00:36:16,811 --> 00:36:18,180
(Doctor's note)

447
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,180
(Doctor's note)

448
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,821
You and your two daughters are suffering from the same disease.

449
00:36:23,821 --> 00:36:24,890
Lupus.

450
00:36:25,591 --> 00:36:27,520
It's not proven to be a genetic disease,

451
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,730
but family history does have an impact.

452
00:36:31,261 --> 00:36:35,101
Everyone in your family suffers from lung diseases caused by lupus.

453
00:36:35,101 --> 00:36:37,071
What are you trying to suggest?

454
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:38,441
Ji Soo died...

455
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,770
because of the illegal materials you people used.

456
00:36:42,841 --> 00:36:44,170
What's your medical ground?

457
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:47,140
She died from pulmonary edema caused by inhalation burn.

458
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,210
That's the cause... That's what caused her death.

459
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:53,150
Yes, exactly.

460
00:36:54,621 --> 00:36:56,490
Mr. Kim used illegal materials.

461
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:58,561
But how are you going to prove that?

462
00:37:04,561 --> 00:37:08,200
On top of that, Ji Soo already had a serious lung condition.

463
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:12,170
How are you going to prove your argument?

464
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:15,770
Did you find an attorney? What did your attorney say?

465
00:37:16,941 --> 00:37:18,411
They're all jerks.

466
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,140
Is that it?

467
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,781
If we're poor and weak, must I keep my silence?

468
00:37:22,781 --> 00:37:24,110
Let's be honest.

469
00:37:24,781 --> 00:37:27,851
You looked into everything, but there's no way you can win.

470
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,450
You knew that before you got started.

471
00:37:35,561 --> 00:37:39,460
Mr. Kim, you also developed a serious lung condition,

472
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,501
so getting a lung transplant is the only way you'll live.

473
00:37:45,071 --> 00:37:47,270
And that's not an easy procedure like an appendectomy.

474
00:37:51,611 --> 00:37:53,981
But I understand how you feel.

475
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:57,251
Your child is sick, but so are you.

476
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,950
You have no money or a way out of this.

477
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:04,590
I'll kill them all.

478
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:08,590
I'll kill you all, then kill myself too.

479
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,861
What about your girl?

480
00:38:25,447 --> 00:38:27,388
Why not point that anger at a specific someone?

481
00:38:31,218 --> 00:38:32,927
Then I'll look into...

482
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:35,598
Ji Ah's surgery.

483
00:38:43,497 --> 00:38:44,838
Those who kidnapped and murdered my child...

484
00:38:44,838 --> 00:38:46,208
won't protect you.

485
00:38:46,567 --> 00:38:50,138
They were ruthless enough to kill a child for their goal.

486
00:38:50,538 --> 00:38:51,848
Do you seriously think they'd protect yours?

487
00:39:02,317 --> 00:39:04,388
- Ae Ri! - Han Ae Ri.

488
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:07,057
Ae Ri.

489
00:39:07,728 --> 00:39:09,228
We found out.

490
00:39:10,158 --> 00:39:11,257
Why are you here so early in the morning?

491
00:39:11,257 --> 00:39:12,367
Come here.

492
00:39:13,468 --> 00:39:15,838
One of our alumni is working at Jeongsin Bank.

493
00:39:16,067 --> 00:39:18,268
Since it's personal information, it should be revealed but...

494
00:39:18,268 --> 00:39:20,807
Hey, I even asked that friend to create a savings account...

495
00:39:20,807 --> 00:39:22,138
for me so that we could find it out.

496
00:39:23,607 --> 00:39:24,778
Did you find out who wired the money?

497
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:28,648
That friend could only tell us the person's name.

498
00:39:29,348 --> 00:39:31,177
- Tell me right now. - Hold on.

499
00:39:35,187 --> 00:39:36,918
"Lee Taek Gyu"?

500
00:39:36,918 --> 00:39:37,918
(The name is "Lee Taek Gyu".)

501
00:39:44,927 --> 00:39:45,997
Hey!

502
00:39:47,367 --> 00:39:50,937
(3H05 5428)

503
00:39:59,447 --> 00:40:02,278
Excuse me.

504
00:40:02,617 --> 00:40:03,648
What is it?

505
00:40:03,848 --> 00:40:06,247
May I make a phone call?

506
00:40:07,288 --> 00:40:08,388
A phone call?

507
00:40:13,588 --> 00:40:14,658
Hello?

508
00:40:16,158 --> 00:40:17,228
Mr. Kim.

509
00:40:18,057 --> 00:40:20,297
Can you come to see me?

510
00:40:23,138 --> 00:40:24,468
I have something to tell you.

511
00:40:25,968 --> 00:40:28,038
I'll visit you. When's the right time?

512
00:40:30,278 --> 00:40:32,747
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

513
00:40:56,367 --> 00:40:58,098
I don't know her at all.

514
00:40:59,437 --> 00:41:01,067
- Thank you. - Goodbye.

515
00:41:08,447 --> 00:41:11,018
Whom have you been searching so desperately since yesterday?

516
00:41:11,377 --> 00:41:12,588
Right.

517
00:41:14,348 --> 00:41:16,888
She's a relative. She's sick, so I've been looking for her.

518
00:41:19,987 --> 00:41:22,927
- Do you know her? - Sure. Ms. Kwak Song Ja, right?

519
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,168
She stayed at our restaurant.

520
00:41:26,268 --> 00:41:28,937
She left not too long ago, saying she had found a place.

521
00:41:28,937 --> 00:41:30,098
Since when was she here?

522
00:41:30,898 --> 00:41:33,538
Let me see. It was two weeks ago and one day before...

523
00:41:33,538 --> 00:41:35,408
the five-day market.

524
00:41:35,638 --> 00:41:37,307
It was on September 14.

525
00:41:37,908 --> 00:41:40,208
(Kim Seo Jin found a dead body.)

526
00:41:41,947 --> 00:41:45,078
(Da Bin gets kidnapped.)

527
00:41:45,078 --> 00:41:47,418
(Kim Jin Ho turned himself in.)

528
00:41:49,218 --> 00:41:50,888
(Visited Yujung Constructions)

529
00:41:50,888 --> 00:41:52,557
(Met Da Bin at a kids café, received 100,000 dollars)

530
00:41:56,528 --> 00:41:58,257
I was actually tailing him...

531
00:41:59,768 --> 00:42:01,168
and found a dead person.

532
00:42:07,337 --> 00:42:10,508
(Call Log, Kim Seo Jin)

533
00:42:18,177 --> 00:42:19,488
Hello? Mr. Kim.

534
00:42:19,717 --> 00:42:21,587
I found out who wired the money to my mom.

535
00:42:21,648 --> 00:42:23,388
Who was it? Do you know them?

536
00:42:24,217 --> 00:42:25,258
It was Lee Taek Gyu.

537
00:42:27,457 --> 00:42:30,528
My mom is safe, right?

538
00:42:32,597 --> 00:42:33,668
Ms. Han.

539
00:42:34,467 --> 00:42:35,837
Listen carefully.

540
00:42:36,638 --> 00:42:38,807
I've been tracking your mother...

541
00:42:38,967 --> 00:42:40,408
since September 14.

542
00:42:40,937 --> 00:42:43,677
You must find her before September 26...

543
00:42:43,677 --> 00:42:44,837
at all costs.

544
00:42:45,378 --> 00:42:48,547
When it's September 14, go to the address I'll give you...

545
00:42:48,547 --> 00:42:49,577
- and... - Why?

546
00:42:50,878 --> 00:42:52,317
Why do I have to find her before September 26?

547
00:42:54,047 --> 00:42:55,888
What happens to her after that?

548
00:42:58,727 --> 00:43:00,358
Mr. Kim.

549
00:43:04,697 --> 00:43:06,868
Whose body was that?

550
00:43:09,998 --> 00:43:12,668
Are you sure you didn't recognize the body?

551
00:43:15,707 --> 00:43:17,177
It was my mom, right?

552
00:43:19,248 --> 00:43:21,547
Lee Taek Gyu killed my mom, didn't he?

553
00:43:21,847 --> 00:43:23,717
Such a thing won't happen.

554
00:43:23,918 --> 00:43:27,817
And if Kim Jin Ho tells me about the accomplice tomorrow,

555
00:43:28,717 --> 00:43:30,187
we'll be able to catch him.

556
00:43:30,388 --> 00:43:31,388
Write this down.

557
00:43:31,587 --> 00:43:33,788

- Ae Ri. - Ae Ri.

564
00:44:04,087 --> 00:44:05,358
What's going on?

565
00:44:08,258 --> 00:44:09,858
What's wrong?

566
00:44:10,057 --> 00:44:12,398
What's going on? Talk to us.

567

Lee Taek Gyu...

568
00:44:15,898 --> 00:44:18,038
It was him.

569
00:44:20,307 --> 00:44:22,807
He was the one at Kim Jin Ho's who tried to kill me.

570
00:44:24,038 --> 00:44:25,477
What is she talking about?

571
00:44:25,707 --> 00:44:27,608
Kim who? Who tried to kill whom?

572
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:30,618
My mom's going to die!

573
00:44:36,587 --> 00:44:38,288
What should I do?

(Restricted Number)

575
00:44:44,158 --> 00:44:45,898
I need to take this.

576
00:44:53,368 --> 00:44:54,467
Hello?

577
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:57,077
Soo Jung, it's me.

578
00:44:58,908 --> 00:45:00,108
Mom?

579
00:45:01,648 --> 00:45:02,977
Is it really you?

580
00:45:04,547 --> 00:45:07,388
Where in the world are you?

581
00:45:09,018 --> 00:45:10,258
I can't do this any longer.

582
00:45:10,717 --> 00:45:12,927
I can't lie to Ae Ri anymore!

583
00:45:13,687 --> 00:45:17,498
I'm going to tell her that you've been calling me.

584
00:45:17,498 --> 00:45:20,268
What's wrong? Is something going on?

585
00:45:20,697 --> 00:45:22,668
Did something happen to Ae Ri?

586
00:45:23,268 --> 00:45:25,168
It's all because of you.

587
00:45:26,337 --> 00:45:28,207
Someone wired you a large sum of money,

588
00:45:28,207 --> 00:45:30,108
and she's panicking.

589
00:45:31,778 --> 00:45:33,677
She's worried sick for you...

590
00:45:33,807 --> 00:45:36,618
because she thinks something has happened to you.

591
00:45:38,018 --> 00:45:41,587
I'm going to transfer that money to Ae Ri tomorrow.

592
00:45:43,888 --> 00:45:46,957
Where did you get that money?

593
00:45:49,227 --> 00:45:51,258
Is something going on?

594
00:45:51,898 --> 00:45:55,297
I got that money in exchange for not seeing Ae Ri ever again.

595
00:45:56,437 --> 00:46:00,768
She'll be all right, so trust me, okay?

596
00:46:01,807 --> 00:46:03,038
Can't you just...

597
00:46:04,038 --> 00:46:06,177
keep in touch with her only?

598
00:46:06,307 --> 00:46:08,347
No. Never.

599
00:46:09,118 --> 00:46:12,047
If I do that, both she and I will die.

600
00:46:13,118 --> 00:46:15,618
If you tell her that you and I have been in touch,

601
00:46:15,618 --> 00:46:17,488
I will never call you again.

602
00:46:19,327 --> 00:46:21,028
I'm sorry.

603
00:46:22,797 --> 00:46:24,858
I'm sorry for burdening you guys.

604
00:46:28,967 --> 00:46:30,138

605
00:46:31,437 --> 00:46:32,508
Mom.

606
00:46:52,788 --> 00:46:54,557
What was that call about?

607
00:47:00,727 --> 00:47:01,827

609

The number you have dialled cannot take incoming calls.

610
00:47:13,447 --> 00:47:15,307
How could you do this to me?

611
00:47:16,018 --> 00:47:17,077
You...

612
00:47:17,518 --> 00:47:19,947
You knew how worried I was.

613
00:47:22,217 --> 00:47:24,618
I was terrified as well.

614
00:47:25,988 --> 00:47:28,827
I was scared that she'd never call me ever again.

615
00:47:28,827 --> 00:47:31,227
Still, you should've at least told me.

616
00:47:31,898 --> 00:47:34,528
Do you even know how important that call could've been?

617
00:47:35,368 --> 00:47:38,398
Had I known you two were talking, I could've saved her.

618
00:47:39,368 --> 00:47:41,567
You always call her Mom,

619
00:47:41,967 --> 00:47:43,677
but would you have done the same if it was your real mom?

620
00:47:44,908 --> 00:47:46,908
I'm truly sorry about this,

621
00:47:47,677 --> 00:47:49,648
but don't you think you're being too harsh?

622
00:47:50,717 --> 00:47:52,547
She said both she and you would be in danger...

623
00:47:52,547 --> 00:47:53,947
if you two spoke to each other.

624
00:47:54,488 --> 00:47:57,817
I only did this to protect both of you.

625
00:48:05,797 --> 00:48:06,898
Go home.

626
00:48:10,238 --> 00:48:11,538

627
00:48:39,797 --> 00:48:42,327

You'll be seeing an outside doctor for your respiratory system.

634

What?

635
00:49:08,927 --> 00:49:10,797
Will I be back before visiting hours?

636
00:49:12,128 --> 00:49:13,398

641
00:49:42,528 --> 00:49:45,227
What's going on? Did your mom call you?

642
00:49:49,467 --> 00:49:50,538
No.

643
00:49:50,538 --> 00:49:52,668
Then how can you know where to find her?

644
00:49:53,937 --> 00:49:54,937
Well...

645
00:49:55,707 --> 00:49:58,837

646

Have you been here before?

No.

00:50:13,158 --> 00:50:15,327
Just how reckless are you?

650
00:50:16,258 --> 00:50:18,858
What if something happens to you there?

651
00:50:20,427 --> 00:50:22,898

Mr. Kim,

685
00:54:04,517 --> 00:54:05,957
Kim Jin Ho took his own life.

686

What? What did you just say?

687
00:54:11,497 --> 00:54:14,668
Kim Jin Ho committed suicide.

688
00:54:18,168 --> 00:54:21,068
He seems to have been on edge lately.

689
00:54:22,838 --> 00:54:24,078
Are you sure?

690
00:54:26,148 --> 00:54:27,908
He asked me to meet him today.

691
00:54:29,378 --> 00:54:31,447
I guess he had a change of heart.

692
00:54:31,447 --> 00:54:32,888
He even left a suicide note.

693
00:54:35,648 --> 00:54:38,588
Why did he have to commit such a terrible crime...

694
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:40,687
if he was only going to kill himself?

695
00:54:43,858 --> 00:54:45,027
Thank you for calling.

696
00:54:47,927 --> 00:54:51,267

Didn't you come to our restaurant yesterday?

702
00:55:17,098 --> 00:55:19,927
Yes, may I ask why you called?

703
00:55:21,128 --> 00:55:22,168
Please go ahead.

704
00:55:22,168 --> 00:55:24,868
When that lady you asked about came here,

705
00:55:24,868 --> 00:55:26,808
she didn't have much luggage.

706
00:55:27,467 --> 00:55:31,507
To make small talk, I asked why she was travelling so lightly,

707
00:55:32,477 --> 00:55:34,608
and she said that she took the bus.

708
00:55:35,247 --> 00:55:36,247
And?

709
00:55:36,318 --> 00:55:38,247
Well, the bus she took makes a stop in between,

710
00:55:38,318 --> 00:55:40,148
and I remember her saying...

711
00:55:40,148 --> 00:55:43,017
that she got on in front of a motel.

712
00:55:44,388 --> 00:55:45,618
Which is where?

713
00:55:45,918 --> 00:55:47,828
It seemed like suicide at first,

714
00:55:47,828 --> 00:55:49,257
but the autopsy showed signs of foul play.

715
00:55:49,497 --> 00:55:50,697
If she had hanged herself,

716
00:55:50,697 --> 00:55:53,027
the ligature mark should be diagonal.

717
00:55:53,027 --> 00:55:54,898
But as you can see, these are parallel.

718
00:55:55,128 --> 00:55:57,838
These marks are only made when strangled by another from behind.

719
00:55:58,697 --> 00:56:01,568
Why did you come to see me with these findings though?

720
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:06,037
We found a small tie pin in the victim's mouth,

721
00:56:06,348 --> 00:56:08,247
which we assume is a dying message.

722
00:56:08,977 --> 00:56:10,677
There's a photo on the last page.

723
00:56:14,088 --> 00:56:15,987
It comes from a custom-made batch...

724
00:56:16,257 --> 00:56:17,757
that was given to the executives of...

725
00:56:17,757 --> 00:56:19,257
Yujung Constructions on its foundation day.

726
00:56:19,757 --> 00:56:21,388
Someone's initials are engraved on it.

727
00:56:23,957 --> 00:56:25,997
Director Kim Seo Jin of Yujung Constructions.

728
00:56:29,997 --> 00:56:31,937
I came to see you because...

729
00:56:31,937 --> 00:56:33,937
you're handling the case that he's a victim of.

730
00:56:49,717 --> 00:56:50,818
Thank you.

731
00:56:59,427 --> 00:57:00,427
Over there.

732
00:57:00,427 --> 00:57:05,237
(Jeonghui Diner)

733
00:57:07,568 --> 00:57:09,578
- Hello. - Welcome.

734
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:11,408
- A table for three? - Yes.

735
00:57:11,578 --> 00:57:13,677
- Excuse me... - Let's order first.

736
00:57:13,777 --> 00:57:15,977
It's not September 14 yet. Three bowls of gukbap, please.

737
00:57:16,148 --> 00:57:17,618
Three bowls of gukbap!

738
00:57:24,687 --> 00:57:26,727
I skipped breakfast, so I'm starving.

739
00:57:26,927 --> 00:57:29,427
Right. We should eat first and then ask them.

740
00:57:30,328 --> 00:57:32,128
Still, I'm not a huge fan of gukbap.

741
00:57:32,227 --> 00:57:33,628
Just eat, okay?

742
00:57:44,037 --> 00:57:48,908
(Feel Motel)

743
00:57:53,418 --> 00:57:56,287
- Excuse me. - Yes? Do you want a room?

744
00:57:56,287 --> 00:58:00,058
Didn't this woman stay here?

745
00:58:01,757 --> 00:58:03,957
Wait, this lady...

746
00:58:04,598 --> 00:58:06,767
Room 305. She was a long-term guest.

747
00:58:08,267 --> 00:58:09,898
When did she start staying here?

748
00:58:10,598 --> 00:58:11,737
Who are you though?

749
00:58:13,467 --> 00:58:15,537
I'm a relative. She's sick,

750
00:58:15,537 --> 00:58:16,737
which is why I'm urgently looking for her.

751
00:58:17,338 --> 00:58:20,177
I think it's been about a month.

752
00:58:21,078 --> 00:58:22,477
But she's long gone now.

753
00:58:22,947 --> 00:58:25,418
She got a job at a diner or something.

754
00:58:26,118 --> 00:58:27,418
Are you sure it's been a month?

755
00:58:28,287 --> 00:58:30,957
It was roughly around that time.

756
00:58:31,017 --> 00:58:33,027
She stayed here for about two weeks.

757
00:58:37,328 --> 00:58:39,558
May I see the room where she used to stay?

758
00:58:39,798 --> 00:58:42,197
Sorry? You want to see her room?

759
00:58:43,598 --> 00:58:45,598
But what for?

760
00:58:48,267 --> 00:58:49,977
I'd like that room. How much is it?

761
00:58:57,378 --> 00:58:59,578
- Hey, Detective Lee. - Kim Seo Jin's phone...

762
00:58:59,578 --> 00:59:01,517
was last tracked at the crime scene on the day of the incident.

763
00:59:02,048 --> 00:59:03,158
What did you say?

764
00:59:04,987 --> 00:59:06,487
Do you know where he is right now?

765
00:59:08,158 --> 00:59:09,858
Okay. I'll see you there.

766
00:59:10,158 --> 00:59:11,227
Bye.

767
00:59:11,558 --> 00:59:12,598
Kim Seo Jin's phone was tracked at the crime scene...

768
00:59:12,598 --> 00:59:13,628
on the day of the incident.

769
00:59:13,668 --> 00:59:15,497
We also know where he is right now. Let's go.

770
00:59:48,197 --> 00:59:51,197
I found the place where your mom stayed a month ago.

771
00:59:51,197 --> 00:59:52,737
(I found the place where your mom stayed a month ago.)

772
01:00:44,458 --> 01:00:46,857
- That was a nice meal. - Did you enjoy it?

773
01:00:47,728 --> 01:00:49,327
It was really tasty. How much is it?

774
01:00:50,498 --> 01:00:51,768
18 dollars.

775
01:00:51,768 --> 01:00:52,968
18 dollars...

776
01:00:53,597 --> 01:00:55,867
- Here you go. - Thank you.

777
01:00:55,867 --> 01:00:57,307
Sir. By any chance...

778
01:00:59,067 --> 01:01:01,807
Have you seen her before? She comes to this market often.

779
01:01:02,407 --> 01:01:03,508
She's my mom.

780
01:01:03,508 --> 01:01:07,047
She's quite ill right now, so we need to find her.

781
01:01:07,948 --> 01:01:09,718
She's ill.

782
01:01:10,018 --> 01:01:12,617
She didn't want to burden her family, so she left home.

783
01:01:12,748 --> 01:01:14,617
- How much is this? - It's pretty much free.

784
01:01:14,617 --> 01:01:15,817
- 5 dollars. - 5 dollars?

785
01:01:15,918 --> 01:01:17,857
- We're selling them for cheap. - Goodbye.

786
01:01:17,857 --> 01:01:20,597
Please call us if you ever see her.

787
01:01:21,498 --> 01:01:23,198
Please look closely at her face.

788
01:01:23,397 --> 01:01:24,897
Are you sure you've never seen her before?

789
01:01:25,728 --> 01:01:27,137
I'm afraid I haven't.

790
01:01:27,397 --> 01:01:30,438
If you ever see her, do call us.

791
01:01:36,347 --> 01:01:37,847
- This is cheap. - Okay.

792
01:01:38,077 --> 01:01:44,788
(Mr. Park Ho Young)

793
01:01:52,988 --> 01:01:55,728
(Mr. Park Ho Young)

794
01:01:55,728 --> 01:01:57,627
(Feel Motel)

795
01:01:58,627 --> 01:02:00,097
Hello, Mr. Park.

796
01:02:01,297 --> 01:02:02,337
Mr. Kim.

797
01:02:02,968 --> 01:02:03,968
Where are you right now?

798
01:02:05,238 --> 01:02:06,877
I'm outside. What's this about?

799
01:02:06,877 --> 01:02:08,107
Where in the world are you?

800
01:02:11,248 --> 01:02:12,307
What's going on?

801
01:02:13,547 --> 01:02:15,877
What were you doing at 10pm on September 26?

802
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:23,387
Why did you kill Ms. Kwak Song Ja?

803
01:02:24,087 --> 01:02:25,127
I didn't kill her.

804
01:02:25,127 --> 01:02:27,597
Your phone was tracked at the scene and at the time...

805
01:02:27,597 --> 01:02:29,157
of her death.

806
01:02:29,897 --> 01:02:30,928
(Han Ae Ri)

807
01:02:32,327 --> 01:02:34,538
It wasn't me. I didn't do it.

808
01:02:37,407 --> 01:02:39,978
Your tie pin was found in her mouth. Will you still deny it?

809
01:02:56,587 --> 01:02:57,758
Turn yourself in this instant.

810
01:02:58,087 --> 01:03:01,127
If you do, I'll try my best to plead for a lighter punishment.

811
01:03:03,097 --> 01:03:04,127
So please turn yourself in.

812
01:03:04,198 --> 01:03:05,928
You won't believe me anyway.

813
01:03:36,357 --> 01:03:38,768
Mr. Kim Seo Jin, you have been surrounded!

814
01:03:38,768 --> 01:03:39,897
Come out this instant!

815
01:03:40,268 --> 01:03:41,538
Mr. Kim!

816
01:03:42,268 --> 01:03:44,307
You have been surrounded! Come out this instant!

817
01:03:51,647 --> 01:03:53,547
Hey, Kim Seo Jin! Hey!

818
01:03:56,448 --> 01:03:57,847
- Bring the key. - Yes, sir.

819
01:03:59,958 --> 01:04:02,418
Mr. Kim, come on out. It's all over.

820
01:04:02,557 --> 01:04:03,557
Okay?

821
01:04:05,958 --> 01:04:08,827
I said, it's all over.

822
01:04:13,797 --> 01:04:14,968
Hey, Kim Seo Jin!

823
01:04:33,617 --> 01:04:35,157
Open the door!

824
01:04:36,458 --> 01:04:37,458
Here you go.

825
01:04:38,657 --> 01:04:39,728
Darn it.

826
01:05:15,028 --> 01:05:16,498
- Over there! - Stop!

827
01:05:21,397 --> 01:05:22,397
Kim Seo Jin!

828
01:05:26,607 --> 01:05:29,107
- I didn't kill her! - Gosh.

829
01:05:29,107 --> 01:05:31,778
Kim Seo Jin, you're under arrest for the murder of Kwak Song Ja.

830
01:05:31,907 --> 01:05:33,518
You have the right to an attorney.

831
01:06:23,627 --> 01:06:25,468
Mom!

832
01:07:02,837 --> 01:07:04,038
Mom.

833
01:07:28,428 --> 01:07:29,557
Ms. Han.

834
01:07:51,588 --> 01:07:52,847
(Kairos)

835
01:07:52,847 --> 01:07:54,418
Ask me anything. I'll answer them all.

836
01:07:54,418 --> 01:07:55,617
Why did you leave the hospital?

837
01:07:55,617 --> 01:07:56,887
What was that wired money?

838
01:07:56,887 --> 01:07:58,757
I don't want to lose anything.

839
01:07:58,757 --> 01:08:00,927
That's what you promised me.

840
01:08:00,958 --> 01:08:02,827
- Trust me. - Kim Jin Ho is dead.

841
01:08:02,898 --> 01:08:04,367
I read about how he committed suicide.

842
01:08:04,367 --> 01:08:06,128
So you don't know anything?

843
01:08:06,128 --> 01:08:07,568
You really don't trust people, do you?

844
01:08:07,568 --> 01:08:08,867
Look who's talking.

845
01:08:08,867 --> 01:08:11,467
If you called yourself a mother, shouldn't you have heard me out...

846
01:08:11,467 --> 01:08:13,407
when I said that your child was in danger?

847
01:08:13,407 --> 01:08:15,938
Am I talking to a lunatic?

848
01:08:15,938 --> 01:08:18,447
Are you ready? You should hurry.

849
01:08:18,447 --> 01:08:19,507
I'll prevent Da Bin from getting kidnapped...

850
01:08:19,507 --> 01:08:21,077
and have Lee Taek Gyu arrested.

851
01:08:21,077 --> 01:08:22,378
Do you have a death wish?

852
01:08:22,378 --> 01:08:24,387
Geon Wook, I need your help.
