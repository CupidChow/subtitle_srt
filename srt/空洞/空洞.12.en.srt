what could the reasons be?

55
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:05,715
Because of the added cost...

56
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,856
and the extension of the construction period.

In a month,

136
00:09:50,922 --> 00:09:52,292
you're going to die.

137
00:09:54,463 --> 00:09:57,292
But I will make sure to save you.

138
00:09:57,932 --> 00:10:00,802
I'm going to make sure that doesn't happen.

139
00:10:01,772 --> 00:10:02,902
Are you listening?

140
00:10:06,142 --> 00:10:07,203
Then...

141
00:10:10,272 --> 00:10:13,213
is Chairman Yu the one who wants me dead?

142
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:14,682
The police are looking into it as we speak.

143
00:10:15,113 --> 00:10:16,853
You said my mom held the key, right?

144
00:10:19,282 --> 00:10:20,953
Because of something that she knows,

145
00:10:23,253 --> 00:10:25,623
I'll die.

146
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,493
I believe it's related...

147
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:29,892
to the collapse of Taejung Town 19 years ago.

148
00:10:30,792 --> 00:10:32,802

151
00:10:37,473 --> 00:10:39,302
I'm really doing everything that I can.

152
00:10:41,243 --> 00:10:42,942
When will I be free?

153
00:10:43,912 --> 00:10:46,213

154

156
00:11:05,763 --> 00:11:09,473
You and I have overcome great hardship up until now.

157

I'm certain we can change the future this time around as well.

- Sleep, Mom. - Okay.

162
00:12:18,843 --> 00:12:20,572
Don't sleep in your room.

163
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:22,812
Sleep here.

164
00:12:23,473 --> 00:12:24,473

170

I'm not sure.

171
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:58,713

Yes.

174
00:13:05,123 --> 00:13:08,253
They went through so much because of me.

175
00:13:29,113 --> 00:13:31,473
Mom, are you ready?

176
00:13:38,113 --> 00:13:39,282
My gosh.

177
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,552
Did I overdo it?

178
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:45,963
We haven't gone on a date in a while, so I got dolled up.

179
00:13:47,322 --> 00:13:48,363

180
00:13:48,532 --> 00:13:49,963
No, go like this.

186
00:14:07,142 --> 00:14:09,883
Let's hurry if we want to avoid rush hour.

187
00:14:10,113 --> 00:14:12,753
Mom, you look way too pretty.

188
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,093
Geon Wook. Soo Jung.

189
00:14:17,093 --> 00:14:19,562
Thank you for taking good care of Ae Ri.

190
00:14:21,263 --> 00:14:24,692
I'm more thankful. I owe her so much.

191
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:27,902
When I was in high school,

192
00:14:27,902 --> 00:14:30,172
my grandma got in a hit-and-run accident.

193
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:32,843
Ae Ri found her and took her to the hospital.

194
00:14:33,942 --> 00:14:36,973
She paid for the hospital bills since I had no money.

195
00:14:38,743 --> 00:14:39,942
You paid me back, though.

196
00:14:39,942 --> 00:14:41,343
There's more.

197
00:14:41,812 --> 00:14:44,353
Mom, he stole her money.

198
00:14:44,353 --> 00:14:45,383
- Last time... - Soo Jung!

199
00:14:45,782 --> 00:14:46,822
What?

200
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,223
He's been paying me back diligently.

201
00:14:51,692 --> 00:14:52,922
Do you remember that time?

202
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,093
I think we were in eighth grade.

203
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:58,032
Our school handed out free sanitary pads...

204
00:14:58,032 --> 00:15:00,603
for students who were from low-income families.

205
00:15:01,772 --> 00:15:04,473
Everyone hesitated.

206
00:15:05,603 --> 00:15:08,203
But Ae Ri was so amazing when she walked forward...

207
00:15:08,203 --> 00:15:10,213
and took some.

208
00:15:11,142 --> 00:15:14,343
That's when I thought, "She's the one..."

209
00:15:14,442 --> 00:15:15,513
"I should hang out with."

210
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:20,383
Please continue to be her friend.

211
00:15:22,093 --> 00:15:23,723
Even if I die first,

212
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,062
I won't be worried since she'll have you two.

213
00:15:26,062 --> 00:15:27,623
- Come on. - Come on.

214
00:15:28,022 --> 00:15:29,593
Please don't say that.

215
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,292
Please take it back.

216
00:15:31,662 --> 00:15:34,603
- You need to. - Okay.

217
00:15:34,603 --> 00:15:36,802
Say it. You need to.

218
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,772
Okay, I take it back.

219
00:15:41,603 --> 00:15:43,912
I should live for a long time because of you guys.

220
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:51,782
- Do you want some more beverages? - I'll buy some with Soo Jung.

221
00:15:52,253 --> 00:15:53,552
- Let's go. - Okay.

222
00:15:55,493 --> 00:15:56,922
We'll buy something tasty.

223
00:16:05,162 --> 00:16:06,802
- Mom. - Yes?

224
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:12,572
I'm going to tell you something very important.

225
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,942
Promise me that you won't get mad and just listen.

226
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:18,583
Why would I get mad at you?

227
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,412
What's this about?

228
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:29,453
You're not going to die before me.

229
00:16:30,922 --> 00:16:32,993
Is that what this is about?

230
00:16:33,263 --> 00:16:36,792
All right. I'll take care of my health.

231
00:16:38,032 --> 00:16:39,902
I'm going to die before you.

232
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:45,072
I'll be dying next month.

233
00:16:47,142 --> 00:16:49,572
Why would you say such a thing?

234
00:16:49,973 --> 00:16:50,973
Ae Ri.

235
00:16:50,973 --> 00:16:53,583
I know that the chairman of Yujung is after you.

236
00:16:54,812 --> 00:16:57,052
I may know what'll happen a month from now,

237
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,483
but that doesn't mean I'll be able to stop all the misfortunes.

238
00:16:59,883 --> 00:17:03,292
Because the core problem still lingers.

239
00:17:03,692 --> 00:17:05,723
Misfortunes will come back...

240
00:17:06,362 --> 00:17:08,993
in different shapes or forms. So Mom...

241
00:17:09,933 --> 00:17:10,993
Please.

242
00:17:11,693 --> 00:17:14,703
Please tell me everything that you know.

243
00:17:14,703 --> 00:17:18,602
I don't know what you've heard,

244
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:21,542
but I have nothing to say.

245
00:17:24,473 --> 00:17:25,483
Then...

246
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:28,582
remember one thing.

247
00:17:30,852 --> 00:17:34,052
A month from now, a man is going to visit you.

248
00:17:35,423 --> 00:17:37,923
And he'll tell you the same thing I just did.

249
00:17:37,953 --> 00:17:41,822
On that day, please tell him everything...

250
00:17:42,592 --> 00:17:44,663
that you couldn't tell me.

251
00:17:46,163 --> 00:17:47,802
I'm sorry.

252
00:17:48,903 --> 00:17:52,403
I'm sorry I can't tell you anything.

253
00:17:52,842 --> 00:17:54,302
It's all my fault.

254
00:17:56,013 --> 00:17:58,143
But no matter what happens,

255
00:17:58,983 --> 00:18:01,683
I'll make sure to protect you.

256
00:18:02,153 --> 00:18:04,352
So don't worry about a thing, okay?

(Police Line, Do Not Cross)

258
00:18:36,213 --> 00:18:37,282
That'll be a dollar.

259
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,822
- Do you need a plastic bag? - I'm good.

260
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:41,352
I was wondering if you know...

261
00:18:41,352 --> 00:18:43,852
about the mother of the girl that died.

262
00:18:43,953 --> 00:18:45,423
We're all neighbours, so yes.

263
00:18:45,723 --> 00:18:48,393
Do you perhaps know where she currently is?

264
00:18:49,733 --> 00:18:52,102
I think she's at some hospital.

265
00:18:53,102 --> 00:18:54,562
Why do you ask though?

266
00:18:54,802 --> 00:18:57,072
Because I haven't seen her around. Anyway, have a good day.

267
00:18:57,233 --> 00:18:58,332
Sure, you too.

268
00:19:05,213 --> 00:19:08,713
(Police Line, Do Not Cross)

269
00:19:10,312 --> 00:19:11,852
I'm starving.

270
00:19:12,522 --> 00:19:15,822
Let's ask Mom to make us bossam with green onion kimchi.

271
00:19:16,393 --> 00:19:17,693
But she's exhausted.

272
00:19:18,092 --> 00:19:20,223
The day's chilly, so let's order gukbap instead.

273
00:19:20,223 --> 00:19:22,893
I told you that I hate gukbap.

274
00:19:22,893 --> 00:19:25,362
How can you hate gukbap?

275
00:19:25,362 --> 00:19:27,862
There's no rule saying that I can't.

276
00:19:28,332 --> 00:19:31,173
I have somewhere to be, so head in first.

277
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:33,572
Where are you headed? Should I accompany you?

278
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:35,243
No, it won't take long.

279
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:38,013
You must be exhausted, so get some rest.

280
00:19:38,213 --> 00:19:40,882
Sure, don't worry about her and go about your way.

281
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:48,622
- Mom, let's head inside. - Sure.

behind Taejung Town's collapse?

I'd like to know the association's view on the matter.

302
00:21:05,463 --> 00:21:06,562
You see,

303
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:10,772
what the media reported back then...

304
00:21:11,372 --> 00:21:12,673
doesn't match the facts.

305
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:15,973
Have you read the related articles?

306
00:21:16,243 --> 00:21:17,243
Yes.

307
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:19,483
I read one that stated how Banyoung Constructions...

308
00:21:19,483 --> 00:21:21,243
pushed forward with the project...

309
00:21:21,342 --> 00:21:24,153
unaware of the sinkhole that existed.

310
00:21:24,153 --> 00:21:25,983
False.

311
00:21:26,183 --> 00:21:28,552
The ground wasn't solid enough, to begin with.

312
00:21:29,453 --> 00:21:30,893
Rumour has it that...

313
00:21:30,893 --> 00:21:33,423
the ground shook whenever big buses drove past.

314
00:21:33,423 --> 00:21:36,163
Would Yujung Constructions have been aware of this?

315
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:42,102
It was said that the two construction companies...

316
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:44,372
and the construction supervisors...

317
00:21:44,372 --> 00:21:47,473
were aware of the matter due to it being addressed in a meeting.

318
00:21:47,602 --> 00:21:49,112
That area consisted of high quantities of basalt rock,

319
00:21:49,112 --> 00:21:52,282
which required more reinforcements that were buried deep.

320
00:21:53,082 --> 00:21:56,183
However, to cut back on money,

321
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:59,552
they went forward with a flimsy construction.

322
00:22:01,282 --> 00:22:04,052
Did you know about it at the time?

323
00:22:04,223 --> 00:22:05,963
Yoo Seok told me.

324
00:22:06,893 --> 00:22:08,493
Kim Seo Jin's father.

325
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:11,592
I was hoping to read the case file regarding my father's death...

326
00:22:12,463 --> 00:22:14,132
that happened 19 years ago.

327
00:22:14,403 --> 00:22:18,102
Back in 2001, his death was ruled as suicide.

328
00:22:19,003 --> 00:22:21,102
Could there be a way to read the actual case file?

329
00:22:22,612 --> 00:22:24,713
Case files of closed cases...

330
00:22:24,713 --> 00:22:26,243
are at the archives...

331
00:22:26,243 --> 00:22:27,643
of the prosecutor's office that investigated the case.

332
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:32,352
19 years was a long time ago though.

333
00:22:33,483 --> 00:22:35,923
And even if you are an immediate family,

334
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:37,993
you'll still need authorization from the prosecutor's office.

335
00:22:38,653 --> 00:22:40,423
If I can't look at the file,

336
00:22:40,423 --> 00:22:43,963
could I at least know who investigated the case?

337
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:47,132
Nothing could be proved on a hunch,

338
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:50,503
so Yoo Seok made it his mission to find definitive evidence.

339
00:22:51,233 --> 00:22:54,042
Then he must've caused trouble for some people.

340
00:22:54,042 --> 00:22:57,013
"Trouble" doesn't even cut it. He was a thorn in their eyes.

341
00:22:58,312 --> 00:23:00,983
The moment Yoo Seok died though,

342
00:23:01,782 --> 00:23:05,052
everyone suddenly lost interest in the cause of the collapse.

343
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,723
What if Kim Seo Jin's father...

344
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:12,223
found the proof he was looking for?

345
00:23:12,622 --> 00:23:14,292
That would've changed a lot of things.

346
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:15,493
At least,

347
00:23:16,163 --> 00:23:17,963
Yujung won't be standing as tall as it does.

348
00:23:18,362 --> 00:23:21,263
The truth would've ended Yujung Constructions for good.

349
00:23:25,542 --> 00:23:27,243
Then Kim Seo Jin's father...

350
00:23:28,973 --> 00:23:30,643
was murdered.

351
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,453

359
00:24:24,032 --> 00:24:25,832
- About Taejung Town... - I have nothing to say.

360
00:24:26,003 --> 00:24:27,302
That happened ages ago.

00:24:30,072 --> 00:24:33,243

00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:43,483
How do you know him?

365
00:24:45,082 --> 00:24:47,653
I've been looking into the collapse of Taejung Town.

366
00:24:48,382 --> 00:24:51,453
He investigated the case, so I went to see him.

367
00:24:51,693 --> 00:24:53,622
Why are you interested in that anyway?

368
00:24:53,822 --> 00:24:55,632
Someone anonymous...

369
00:24:55,693 --> 00:24:58,132
sent me a report regarding the cause of the accident.

370
00:24:58,393 --> 00:25:00,132
It seemed too serious to dismiss,

371
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:01,963
- so I... - Back off!

372
00:25:04,632 --> 00:25:05,772
You're the one...

373
00:25:05,772 --> 00:25:07,473
who told me to take...

374
00:25:07,473 --> 00:25:08,772
a serious approach to the Taejung New Town project.

375
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:11,572
And I believe that clearing the air with the victims...

376
00:25:11,572 --> 00:25:14,683
regarding the collapse is the way to do it.

377
00:25:14,683 --> 00:25:17,082
Yujung isn't responsible for that incident.

378
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:18,112
However,

379
00:25:18,812 --> 00:25:21,082
when the sinkhole was discovered,

380
00:25:21,082 --> 00:25:23,253
an emergency task force was put together...

381
00:25:23,253 --> 00:25:26,092
but with only people from the side of Yujung Constructions...

382
00:25:26,622 --> 00:25:28,622
at the main executive positions.

383
00:25:29,062 --> 00:25:30,763
Yujung is also responsible...

384
00:25:30,763 --> 00:25:33,602
- for jerry-building... - I took you in,

385
00:25:33,862 --> 00:25:36,703
supported you since the day you were rescued,

386
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:40,443
and helped you become one of Yujung's top executives.

387
00:25:40,903 --> 00:25:44,513
No apology can be louder than my actions toward you.

388
00:25:48,842 --> 00:25:50,052
I hear you, sir.

389
00:25:50,312 --> 00:25:51,582
It ends here.

390
00:25:52,753 --> 00:25:54,453
Have I made myself clear?

391
00:25:56,153 --> 00:25:57,693
- Yes, sir. - You're dismissed.

392
00:26:18,612 --> 00:26:19,812
Yes, Mr. Yu.

393
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:22,782
Find whoever gave Kim Seo Jin that file.

394
00:26:23,153 --> 00:26:25,923
You came all this way despite your busy schedule?

395
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:29,622
I already confirmed I made the delivery.

396
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:37,393
Who had it delivered to Kim Seo Jin?

397
00:26:37,433 --> 00:26:38,792
I really don't know.

398
00:26:38,792 --> 00:26:39,903
Was it handed over in person?

399
00:26:39,903 --> 00:26:42,933
I was told to take it from the subway station locker.

400
00:26:42,973 --> 00:26:45,102
All I did was deliver the file.

401
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:56,413
The phone number... I'll give you the phone number.

402
00:26:56,413 --> 00:26:58,683
The person called me on my phone.

403
00:26:58,683 --> 00:26:59,822
Here.

404
00:27:12,532 --> 00:27:14,403
Dad, come over here.

405
00:27:14,562 --> 00:27:16,233
Oh, sure.

406
00:27:22,403 --> 00:27:23,413
What is it?

407
00:27:23,473 --> 00:27:24,913
Here.

408
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:27,513
Gosh, what's this?

409
00:27:28,143 --> 00:27:29,382
Let me see.

410
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:31,753
- Is this me? - Yes.

411
00:27:31,753 --> 00:27:32,953
It looks just like me.

412
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:36,352
- Right? - Yes, just like you.

413
00:27:49,703 --> 00:27:50,832
Hello?

414
00:27:56,072 --> 00:27:59,342
I thought my heart was going to burst yesterday.

415
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:01,042
Why?

416
00:28:01,342 --> 00:28:03,782
I finally got to play at the music hall of my dreams.

417
00:28:04,312 --> 00:28:06,483
It was my best performance yet.

418
00:28:06,483 --> 00:28:08,653
I know the feeling too.

419
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:11,423
The day I performed with the conductor I admired...

420
00:28:11,522 --> 00:28:13,163
is one I'll never forget.

421
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:16,332
Hyun Chae, is there a performance you'll always remember?

422
00:28:25,173 --> 00:28:29,102
For me, it's my family recital, which we held at home in the garden.

423
00:28:31,013 --> 00:28:33,082
Everyone in my family loves music,

424
00:28:33,112 --> 00:28:36,582
so we got together every weekend and played as a family.

425
00:28:37,513 --> 00:28:38,812
I loved that the most.

426
00:28:39,522 --> 00:28:43,022
Your house must've been large enough to have a recital in the garden.

427
00:28:43,193 --> 00:28:45,753
And your parents must be very cultured people.

428
00:28:46,163 --> 00:28:47,522
I'm jealous.

429
00:28:48,122 --> 00:28:49,263
Don't say that.

430
00:28:50,032 --> 00:28:52,332
Anyway, who's that guy?

431
00:28:53,903 --> 00:28:56,332
He has been staring at us for some time.

432
00:28:57,733 --> 00:28:59,703
Should we call the guard?

433
00:29:06,483 --> 00:29:08,183
I need to use the restroom.

434
00:29:18,753 --> 00:29:22,362
You'll never get what you want if you continue to do as you please.

435
00:29:22,362 --> 00:29:23,893
Don't get worked up.

436
00:29:24,193 --> 00:29:27,602
I just came out for a stroll to check on you.

437
00:29:28,903 --> 00:29:30,973
Wait quietly until the agreed date.

438
00:29:33,673 --> 00:29:35,473
What are you so afraid of?

439
00:29:35,842 --> 00:29:37,342
I had no idea you could get scared of something.

440
00:29:39,913 --> 00:29:41,683
How you set your house on fire...

441
00:29:41,683 --> 00:29:44,382
to kill your own dad at the age of seven?

442
00:29:45,112 --> 00:29:48,723
Or how you disabled your friend at the orphanage...

443
00:29:48,723 --> 00:29:50,893
and got adopted by a rich family in her place?

444
00:29:52,393 --> 00:29:55,723
Or that you cut off your foster parents when they went bankrupt...

445
00:29:56,532 --> 00:29:57,993
and went to work at a bar,

446
00:29:58,393 --> 00:30:01,163
then completely lying about your background to get married?

447
00:30:01,663 --> 00:30:02,733
Which one?

448
00:30:04,203 --> 00:30:06,403
See that?

449
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:10,272
How can I not get anxious?

450
00:30:11,112 --> 00:30:13,243
Every word you blurt out is a lie.

451
00:30:13,612 --> 00:30:15,743
How can I trust you and wait quietly?

452
00:30:19,852 --> 00:30:22,893
Don't dream of doing anything else in this life.

453
00:30:23,753 --> 00:30:25,052
You wench.

454
00:30:52,923 --> 00:30:55,022
- Hello? - Make me some passports.

455
00:30:55,223 --> 00:30:56,352
Can you do that?

456
00:30:56,493 --> 00:30:58,223
You have one you made last month.

457
00:30:58,552 --> 00:31:00,362
No, I need a new one.

458
00:31:00,763 --> 00:31:02,463
It'll be pretty expensive if you need three new ones.

459
00:31:03,092 --> 00:31:04,933
I just need two, mine and Da Bin's.

460
00:31:06,663 --> 00:31:09,263
- What about Mr. Seo? - Don't make me repeat myself.

461
00:31:13,072 --> 00:31:14,602
Get me two passports as soon as possible.

462
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:16,612
I'll pay you right away.

463
00:31:35,107 --> 00:31:36,977
Da Bin, Dad is home.

464
00:31:37,636 --> 00:31:38,677
Dad.

465
00:31:40,177 --> 00:31:41,247
Where's Mom?

466
00:31:42,847 --> 00:31:45,517
Hey, what's wrong, Da Bin?

467
00:31:46,147 --> 00:31:47,246
Are you angry?

468
00:31:48,886 --> 00:31:49,956
What's wrong?

469
00:31:52,316 --> 00:31:53,856
What's wrong? Does it hurt?

470
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:56,187
No, it doesn't hurt.

471
00:32:02,697 --> 00:32:05,066
When did this happen? Did you fall down?

472
00:32:19,847 --> 00:32:21,417
- Hello? - Where are you?

473
00:32:22,186 --> 00:32:23,657
Did you know Da Bin was hurt?

474
00:32:25,186 --> 00:32:27,256
Da Bin is hurt? How?

475
00:32:27,256 --> 00:32:29,326
Why did you leave her alone? What were you doing?

476
00:32:31,127 --> 00:32:33,826
I'm taking her to the hospital. We'll talk later.

477
00:32:35,826 --> 00:32:39,337
I'm sorry. Let me hold you.

478
00:32:42,266 --> 00:32:43,337
Let's go.

479
00:32:51,647 --> 00:32:52,677
Let's go.

480
00:33:03,697 --> 00:33:06,057
We'll be at the hospital soon. Hang in there.

481
00:33:16,807 --> 00:33:19,406
The doctor treated you, so you should be fine now.

482
00:33:21,346 --> 00:33:23,317
Dad, are you angry?

483
00:33:23,516 --> 00:33:25,777
Why would I be? I'm not angry.

484
00:33:26,947 --> 00:33:28,346
Since when did it hurt?

485
00:33:28,346 --> 00:33:31,716
Yesterday, I fell down trying to put up stickers.

486
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:35,427
It hurt since that time, but I held it back.

487
00:33:37,356 --> 00:33:40,626
Why did you do that? You should've told me right away.

488
00:33:40,927 --> 00:33:44,797
You and Mom get into fights because of me.

489
00:33:55,346 --> 00:33:56,446
Da Bin.

490
00:33:57,716 --> 00:33:59,376
It's not your fault.

491
00:34:02,846 --> 00:34:04,756
It wasn't because of you.

492
00:34:06,087 --> 00:34:07,487
"It's not because of you."

493
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:13,566
You always wanted to tell her that, but you never could.

494
00:34:15,767 --> 00:34:19,436
"Mom and Dad aren't fighting because of you, Da Bin."

495
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:20,767
That's something...

496
00:34:21,566 --> 00:34:24,006
you have to tell her.

497
00:34:25,976 --> 00:34:27,077
Da Bin.

498
00:34:28,506 --> 00:34:30,246
I never told you this, right?

499
00:34:30,846 --> 00:34:31,916
Tell me what?

500
00:34:35,887 --> 00:34:37,387
It's not because of you.

501
00:34:39,017 --> 00:34:40,726
It's not your fault.

502
00:34:44,027 --> 00:34:46,827
Da Bin, I'm sorry.

503
00:34:47,726 --> 00:34:50,267
You didn't do anything wrong.

504
00:34:51,267 --> 00:34:52,436
Really?

505
00:34:52,767 --> 00:34:55,607
Of course. I'm the one at fault.

506
00:34:56,367 --> 00:34:59,006
I'm sorry I wasn't considerate enough for you.

507
00:35:00,246 --> 00:35:03,006
It was great to go on that trip with you, Dad.

508
00:35:03,246 --> 00:35:04,416
Really?

509
00:35:07,087 --> 00:35:09,786
Da Bin, is there anything you want me to do?

510
00:35:10,117 --> 00:35:12,316
What kind of a dad do you want me to be?

511
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:17,756
Someone who can play with you?

512
00:35:17,756 --> 00:35:19,867
No, you should work.

513
00:35:22,566 --> 00:35:23,596
Then?

514
00:35:24,496 --> 00:35:25,637
Promises.

515
00:35:25,966 --> 00:35:27,506
Promises? What promises?

516
00:35:27,807 --> 00:35:30,506
A dad who always keeps his promises with me.

517
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:34,246
You said you'll come to my recital, but you didn't,

518
00:35:34,476 --> 00:35:36,446
so it made me very sad.

519
00:35:40,387 --> 00:35:41,487
Really?

520
00:35:44,916 --> 00:35:48,556
Then let me make a promise to you.

521
00:35:49,527 --> 00:35:51,156
No matter what happens,

522
00:35:52,497 --> 00:35:54,166
I'll make sure I protect you.

523
00:35:54,397 --> 00:35:56,666
- It's a promise. - Promise.

524
00:35:56,666 --> 00:35:58,937
You have to keep it.

525
00:36:03,906 --> 00:36:05,536
- Okay. - Da Bin.

526
00:36:05,777 --> 00:36:08,447
- Mom. - Da Bin, what happened?

527
00:36:09,676 --> 00:36:11,116
She sprained her ankle when she fell down.

528
00:36:14,817 --> 00:36:15,947
Let's go home.

529
00:36:17,387 --> 00:36:18,387
What?

530
00:36:24,856 --> 00:36:26,296
I'm sorry I got angry at you.

531
00:36:27,596 --> 00:36:30,497
I took it out on you because I was heartbroken.

532
00:36:32,497 --> 00:36:34,067
What has gotten into you these days?

533
00:36:34,736 --> 00:36:36,306
You sound like a guy who's about to die soon.

534
00:36:37,277 --> 00:36:38,736
I just feel really bad, that's all.

535
00:36:39,437 --> 00:36:40,976
I'm sure you were surprised too.

536
00:36:43,602 --> 00:36:45,642
Give me the key. I'll drive.

537
00:36:45,842 --> 00:36:48,012
It's okay. You don't like driving at night time.

538
00:36:48,311 --> 00:36:49,342
I'll do it.

539
00:36:49,981 --> 00:36:51,412
Da Bin, what should we do at home?

540
00:36:57,251 --> 00:36:58,751
One minute.

541
00:37:01,022 --> 00:37:03,592
Be careful. Watch your ankle.

542
00:37:19,972 --> 00:37:21,611
I'm Im Geon Wook, Ae Ri's friend.

543
00:37:21,611 --> 00:37:23,712
Please call me as soon as you get this.

544
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,142
Hello?

545
00:37:52,741 --> 00:37:54,272
This is Kim Seo Jin.

546
00:37:54,371 --> 00:37:57,282
I just received your message and called you.

547
00:37:58,082 --> 00:37:59,311
Do you remember me?

548
00:38:00,981 --> 00:38:03,082
Yes, I do.

549
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:07,691
Are you still in touch with Ae Ri...

550
00:38:07,791 --> 00:38:08,892
from a month ago?

551
00:38:10,462 --> 00:38:11,491
Yes.

552
00:38:12,061 --> 00:38:13,631
Then you can save her, right?

553
00:38:15,162 --> 00:38:16,291
Tell me the truth.

554
00:38:16,532 --> 00:38:19,801
I'll save her at all costs.

555
00:38:21,631 --> 00:38:24,772
I'll do everything and anything I can.

556
00:38:24,941 --> 00:38:27,572
The police are chasing me as we speak,

557
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,541
so it's been difficult for me to move around.

558
00:38:31,881 --> 00:38:34,811
What happened to her?

559
00:38:43,162 --> 00:38:44,561
When they found her,

560
00:38:45,361 --> 00:38:47,592
there was a plastic bag wrapped around her head.

561
00:38:50,501 --> 00:38:51,561
Ae Ri...

562
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:58,301
couldn't even breathe...

563
00:38:59,241 --> 00:39:01,111
while she was being strangled.

564
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:06,652
That's why she couldn't fight back.

565
00:39:07,452 --> 00:39:09,481
The crime scene is so clean.

566
00:39:11,352 --> 00:39:14,691
When I think about how scared she must have been,

567
00:39:15,092 --> 00:39:16,352
it makes me go crazy.

568
00:39:18,162 --> 00:39:19,962
It was that scumbag, Lee Taek Gyu, right?

569
00:39:21,832 --> 00:39:24,532
Call the past me and tell me to kill him.

570
00:39:25,662 --> 00:39:28,371
Please make this go away, Mr. Kim.

571
00:39:30,342 --> 00:39:31,402
I'll make sure...

572
00:39:32,941 --> 00:39:34,541
to save her.

573
00:39:40,681 --> 00:39:42,152
It'll be 10:33pm soon.

574
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:45,522
I'll contact you again.

575
00:39:46,652 --> 00:39:48,051
You should speak with Ae Ri now.

576
00:39:48,592 --> 00:39:49,722
Okay.

577
00:39:55,832 --> 00:39:57,001
(Incoming Call)

578
00:39:57,001 --> 00:39:58,431
(Kim Seo Jin)

579
00:40:01,802 --> 00:40:02,871
Mr. Kim.

580
00:40:03,542 --> 00:40:05,302
I visited the victims' association today.

581
00:40:05,672 --> 00:40:07,042
I'm certain Chairman Yu is hiding something...

582
00:40:07,042 --> 00:40:08,672
regarding the disaster 19 years ago.

583
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:11,511
A month ago, I was looking into the same thing.

584
00:40:11,741 --> 00:40:14,312
It was evident that Yujung was responsible for that incident.

585
00:40:14,452 --> 00:40:17,422
I was looking for some decisive evidence.

586
00:40:18,751 --> 00:40:20,391
I need to persuade my mom.

587
00:40:21,792 --> 00:40:24,361
I tried talking with her today, but to no avail.

588
00:40:25,361 --> 00:40:27,792
I'm sure it'll be difficult for her to understand.

589
00:40:28,491 --> 00:40:30,901
Let's look for another way.

590
00:40:31,001 --> 00:40:32,062
Did you know...

591
00:40:32,501 --> 00:40:35,501
that your father and mine were close?

592
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:37,501
I didn't.

593
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:40,312
I asked my mom if she knew your father.

594
00:40:40,812 --> 00:40:44,182
But she refuses to talk about anything related to Yujung.

595
00:40:44,511 --> 00:40:46,712
But if you talk with her yourself,

596
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:48,651
maybe she'll give you an answer.

597
00:40:48,781 --> 00:40:50,852
Okay. By the way,

598
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:54,251
your friend, Geon Wook, decided to help me.

599
00:40:54,422 --> 00:40:56,761
Many people are doing their best to save you,

600
00:40:56,922 --> 00:40:58,222
so it will work out.

601
00:40:58,521 --> 00:40:59,722
Please...

602
00:41:46,572 --> 00:41:48,472
You shouldn't be in there.

603
00:41:49,572 --> 00:41:50,712
Excuse me.

604
00:41:54,682 --> 00:41:55,712
I...

605
00:41:56,822 --> 00:41:58,582
I'm here to see someone who lives there.

606
00:41:58,682 --> 00:41:59,922
Did something happen?

607
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:02,922
Can't you see?

608
00:42:04,192 --> 00:42:06,121
There had been a murder case.

609
00:42:07,891 --> 00:42:10,562
The young woman who had lived there was killed.

610
00:42:12,102 --> 00:42:13,871
I can't believe such a thing happened in our neighbourhood.

611
00:42:13,871 --> 00:42:16,432
Goodness. It's unbelievable.

612
00:42:29,952 --> 00:42:30,981
Ae Ri.

613
00:42:32,981 --> 00:42:33,991
Yes?

614
00:42:34,792 --> 00:42:37,021
Can we talk for a minute?

615
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:52,702
Mom.

616
00:42:53,972 --> 00:42:55,342
Did you not sleep well last night?

617
00:42:55,942 --> 00:42:57,812
You look so pallid.

618
00:42:58,911 --> 00:43:01,011
- Ae Ri. - Yes?

619
00:43:02,411 --> 00:43:05,182
I thought a lot last night...

620
00:43:06,121 --> 00:43:08,722
about why you said such a thing.

621
00:43:10,222 --> 00:43:13,021
"I must've made her so anxious..."

622
00:43:13,092 --> 00:43:15,562
"for her to utter such a thing."

623
00:43:16,192 --> 00:43:17,531
Mom.

624
00:43:17,932 --> 00:43:19,901
It's all my fault.

625
00:43:20,972 --> 00:43:22,972
I'm not talking about just this.

626
00:43:24,202 --> 00:43:25,802
Ever since you lost your dad...

627
00:43:27,011 --> 00:43:28,712
and I became ill,

628
00:43:30,381 --> 00:43:33,881
my heart breaks every time I think of you.

629
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,751
Don't say that.

630
00:43:36,611 --> 00:43:39,082
I'm thankful that you two are my parents.

631
00:43:47,031 --> 00:43:48,062
What is this?

632
00:43:54,302 --> 00:43:55,371
This was...

633
00:43:56,672 --> 00:43:58,141
Dad's, right?

634
00:44:00,942 --> 00:44:03,042
After what happened to your dad,

635
00:44:04,812 --> 00:44:08,082
my whole world fell apart in an instant.

636
00:44:09,381 --> 00:44:11,881
I was wondering...

637
00:44:11,881 --> 00:44:15,852
how you found this watch again.

638
00:44:16,391 --> 00:44:19,021
And it felt like your dad was saying,

639
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:24,361
"I'll be by your side forever, Ae Ri."

640
00:44:30,371 --> 00:44:31,401
Ae Ri.

641
00:44:33,611 --> 00:44:34,641
I will never...

642
00:44:35,511 --> 00:44:38,011
leave you.

643
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:43,182
I'm going to stay with you until the day I die.

644
00:44:43,411 --> 00:44:44,452
So...

645
00:44:45,881 --> 00:44:48,021
stop worrying.

646
00:44:52,391 --> 00:44:55,391
I know that what I'm telling you sounds bizarre.

647
00:44:57,231 --> 00:44:59,602
But you'll eventually understand...

648
00:45:00,501 --> 00:45:01,932
why I'm telling you this.

649
00:45:02,531 --> 00:45:03,771
In a month...

650
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:07,042
In a month from now,

651
00:45:08,312 --> 00:45:12,042
the son of one of our dad's friends will visit you.

652
00:45:12,442 --> 00:45:15,251
- Ae Ri. - Please hear me out.

653
00:45:15,952 --> 00:45:17,182
Please remember this.

654
00:45:17,521 --> 00:45:18,781
In a month,

655
00:45:20,151 --> 00:45:23,251
when that man comes and talks about Dad,

656
00:45:24,422 --> 00:45:25,661
please hear him out.

657
00:45:26,562 --> 00:45:27,592
Okay?

658
00:45:45,812 --> 00:45:47,651
- Geon Wook. - Hey.

659
00:45:49,781 --> 00:45:51,121
Can you fix this?

660
00:45:51,422 --> 00:45:53,082
You should replace the glass first.

661
00:45:53,722 --> 00:45:54,792
Where did you get this?

662
00:45:55,692 --> 00:45:56,922
It was my dad's.

663
00:46:03,031 --> 00:46:05,562
Okay. I'll do my best to get this fixed.

664
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:11,042
I should get going then.

665
00:46:11,842 --> 00:46:12,942
Already?

666
00:46:13,911 --> 00:46:15,442
I feel uneasy about my mom being alone.

667
00:46:17,712 --> 00:46:18,911
Okay, then. Bye.

668
00:46:27,722 --> 00:46:30,521
your friend, Geon Wook, decided to help me.

669
00:46:33,932 --> 00:46:34,991
Geon Wook.

670
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,791
Thank you for everything.

671
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:46,691
What... That's a silly thing to say.

672
00:46:47,901 --> 00:46:49,700
I'll put a rush on this and get back to you.

673
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:17,631
Ae Ri...

674
00:47:19,661 --> 00:47:20,960
Ae Ri...

675
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:06,970
Ms. Kwak.

676
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:19,450
I'm...

677
00:48:22,661 --> 00:48:24,391
in contact with your daughter...

678
00:48:25,391 --> 00:48:26,931
living a month in the past.

679
00:48:30,330 --> 00:48:31,570
I can...

680
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,770
bring her back to life.

681
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:39,671
Please tell me what you know...

682
00:48:39,941 --> 00:48:41,411
about Yujung Construction's Chairman Yu.

683
00:48:41,641 --> 00:48:43,111
I'll resolve this matter.

684
00:48:43,851 --> 00:48:45,550
Who are you?

685
00:48:46,111 --> 00:48:49,750
I'm Kim Seo Jin.

686
00:48:50,691 --> 00:48:52,621
Kim Seo Jin?

687
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:57,331
It's nice to meet you.

688
00:48:57,631 --> 00:48:59,960
I'm the wife of Director Kim Seo Jin from Yujung Constructions.

689
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:05,000
Director Kim Seo Jin from Yujung Constructions.

690
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:08,071
- Is that you? - Yes.

691
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,270
Get out.

692
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:14,710
Get out of here.

693
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:16,040
Leave!

694
00:49:16,641 --> 00:49:21,950
Yujung Constructions... You murderers!

695
00:49:23,651 --> 00:49:25,750
Don't you remember what Ms. Han told you last month?

696
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:28,020
She said she was going to die in a month...

697
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:29,490
and that someone would come to you...

698
00:49:30,661 --> 00:49:32,591
asking the same question she did.

699
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:35,060
She asked you to tell that person...

700
00:49:35,661 --> 00:49:37,431
what you know.

701
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:39,970
You remember that, right?

702
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:47,911
The son of one of our dad's friends will visit you.

703
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,240
Ae Ri.

704
00:49:49,441 --> 00:49:52,381
Please remember this. In a month,

705
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:57,020
when that man comes and talks about Dad,

706
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:59,421
please hear him out.

707
00:50:00,191 --> 00:50:01,220
Okay?

708
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:05,891
I'm the son...

709
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,560
of Kim Yoo Seok.

710
00:50:15,371 --> 00:50:16,671
I'm currently searching for evidence...

711
00:50:16,671 --> 00:50:18,270
that'll prove Chairman Yu's corruption.

712
00:50:18,571 --> 00:50:19,710
That is why...

713
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:22,681
I am in desperate need of your help.

714
00:50:23,341 --> 00:50:24,780
What...

715
00:50:26,181 --> 00:50:29,950
What good would any of it do though?

716
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:36,321
Are you saying that you can bring my daughter back?

717
00:50:36,861 --> 00:50:39,391
Yes, I promise...

718
00:50:40,631 --> 00:50:42,500
to bring her back to life.

719
00:50:54,911 --> 00:50:57,010
What do you need me to do?

720
00:51:01,181 --> 00:51:03,651
It was what my daughter wanted,

721
00:51:05,121 --> 00:51:07,891
so I'll at least hear you out.

722
00:51:08,821 --> 00:51:10,220
All I need is a minute.

723
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:15,161
Just a minute at 10:33pm.

724
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:19,270
All you'll need to do is talk on my phone.

725
00:51:30,641 --> 00:51:32,181
Hello, Mr. Park.

726
00:51:32,181 --> 00:51:34,651
I have the case file on Kim Yoo Seok's death.

727
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:36,081
I'll be right there.

728
00:51:40,861 --> 00:51:43,621
No suicide note was found, but all circumstances...

729
00:51:43,821 --> 00:51:45,431
must've pointed to a suicide.

730
00:51:46,391 --> 00:51:48,260
It seems like he fell.

731
00:51:48,861 --> 00:51:50,560
By the looks of it,

732
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,931
he must've been devastated...

733
00:51:53,101 --> 00:51:57,071
over the fact that you still hadn't been rescued.

734
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:01,381
Is this all?

735
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:04,010
Weren't there any witnesses or evidence?

736
00:52:04,151 --> 00:52:05,550
There weren't any witnesses.

737
00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:10,250
Mr. Kim's fingerprints were found on the railing...

738
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:12,851
as well as unidentified partial fingerprints.

739
00:52:12,851 --> 00:52:14,091
(Partial Fingerprint: the trace of a partial fingerprint)

740
00:52:14,091 --> 00:52:17,161
He died in 2001, right?

741
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:20,091
Back then, it took at least five days...

742
00:52:20,361 --> 00:52:22,101
to get an ID on a full fingerprint.

743
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:25,571
To consider that person as a suspect would've been far-fetched.

744
00:52:25,571 --> 00:52:28,601
What about now? It's been 19 years.

745
00:52:28,601 --> 00:52:30,740
Well, in 2012,

746
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,310
the automated fingerprint identification system...

747
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:34,310
was introduced.

748
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:36,681
It would be possible to match the partials...

749
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,980
with the fingerprints on the resident database.

750
00:52:41,151 --> 00:52:43,450
Then please have it done.

751
00:53:06,941 --> 00:53:11,750
(Daddy)

752
00:53:39,441 --> 00:53:42,381
Are you ready for this?

753
00:53:43,441 --> 00:53:47,111
Who on earth will I be talking to?

754
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,861
Hello, Mr. Kim.

755
00:54:04,270 --> 00:54:06,071
Did you meet my mother today?

756
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:10,300
Hello?

757
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:12,710
Mr. Kim?

758
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:14,841
Can you hear me?

759
00:54:14,841 --> 00:54:16,181
Ae Ri...

760
00:54:20,081 --> 00:54:21,151
Mom?

761
00:54:22,851 --> 00:54:24,290
Ae Ri...

762
00:54:26,450 --> 00:54:27,520
Mom...

763
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,790
Did you meet Mr. Kim?

764
00:54:31,861 --> 00:54:34,901
My daughter, where are you?

765
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:37,101
Please come to me.

766
00:54:37,361 --> 00:54:40,200
Come to me right now.

767
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:44,641
Come to me, Ae Ri.

768
00:54:45,071 --> 00:54:47,881
I miss you so much.

769
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,381
Mom, listen to me carefully.

770
00:54:53,181 --> 00:54:55,520
What you decide to do can change the future.

771
00:54:56,351 --> 00:54:57,720
Please trust me...

772
00:54:58,250 --> 00:54:59,851
and trust Mr. Kim.

773
00:54:59,851 --> 00:55:02,460
We can do this.

774
00:55:02,661 --> 00:55:04,020
We can change it all.

775
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:12,200
Ae Ri... Ae Ri?

776
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:15,141
Ae Ri? No, don't go.

777
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:18,540
Ae Ri!

778
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:20,510
Ae Ri...

779
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:48,770
How much time do we have?

780
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:51,641
We have a month until Ms. Han's death,

781
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:55,111
but we must solve the underlying issue first.

782
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:58,310
If we don't, the same outcome...

783
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:01,351
could repeat itself.

784
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,581
What is it that you have to say?

785
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:34,851
I thought our business was done.

786
00:56:40,421 --> 00:56:41,560
Get lost if you have nothing to say.

787
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,220
Were you the one who killed Ae Ri as well?

788
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:46,560
What are you talking about?

789
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:52,071
It was you.

790
00:57:00,641 --> 00:57:02,010
It was because of her mom, wasn't it?

791
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:04,181
Because she has something that Chairman Yu is worried about.

792
00:57:05,881 --> 00:57:07,780
He's getting rid of everyone who knows about that.

793
00:57:11,621 --> 00:57:13,250
Just like Kang Hyun Chae,

794
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:15,361
you're sounding me out without knowing anything.

795
00:57:19,331 --> 00:57:22,631
Do Kyun, don't get smart with Chairman Yu, or you'll die too.

796
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,270
Must you go this far for a woman who was going to abandon you?

797
00:57:29,941 --> 00:57:31,411
Hyun Chae was going to abandon me?

798
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:38,111
Hyun Chae was never interested in you.

799
00:57:39,181 --> 00:57:40,851
What on earth are you talking about?

800
00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:52,560
(Name: Jung Yu Bin)

801
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:55,300
She asked me to make passports for just her and Da Bin.

802
00:57:58,671 --> 00:58:01,341
Once she had received money from Chairman Yu,

803
00:58:01,401 --> 00:58:03,371
she was going to fly out and leave you behind.

804
00:58:05,911 --> 00:58:07,941
Darn it.

805
00:58:08,810 --> 00:58:09,941
So Do Kyun,

806
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:13,480
snap out of it.

807
00:58:51,935 --> 00:58:53,836
Recently, I received a parcel from an anonymous sender.

808
00:58:53,895 --> 00:58:56,366
May I know the sender's number?

809
00:58:56,405 --> 00:58:59,175
I'm afraid I can't tell you that. What's wrong?

810
00:59:00,806 --> 00:59:02,306
I'll pay you handsomely.

811
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:08,616
The one who sent the report was...

812
00:59:14,215 --> 00:59:16,856
(This is Kwak Song Ja.)

813
00:59:16,856 --> 00:59:20,126
This is Kwak Song Ja. I don't have it at the moment.

814
00:59:20,255 --> 00:59:21,596
Let's go get it together.

815
00:59:28,705 --> 00:59:29,905
Is anyone in there?

816
00:59:40,816 --> 00:59:41,945
Mr. Kim Jin Ho.

817
00:59:42,846 --> 00:59:44,145
This is Kim Seo Jin.

818
00:59:48,326 --> 00:59:49,425
Mr. Kim.

819
00:59:52,187 --> 00:59:55,897
Goodness, what has happened here?

820
00:59:57,627 --> 01:00:00,968
Do you think something happened to him because of me?

821
01:00:05,238 --> 01:00:06,607
Recently, I received a parcel from an anonymous sender.

822
01:00:06,607 --> 01:00:08,308
May I know the sender's number?

823
01:00:08,308 --> 01:00:10,337
I'm afraid I can't tell you that. What's wrong?

824
01:00:15,248 --> 01:00:16,248
Hello?

825
01:00:18,048 --> 01:00:19,218
Mr. Kim.

826
01:00:20,587 --> 01:00:21,617
I'm listening.

827
01:00:23,058 --> 01:00:25,528
- Mr. Kim Jin Ho? - How did you get my number?

828
01:00:25,827 --> 01:00:27,187
I received your parcel.

829
01:00:27,657 --> 01:00:30,397
But more importantly, you may be in danger.

830
01:00:31,768 --> 01:00:32,927
You should go somewhere safe as soon as possible.

831
01:00:37,298 --> 01:00:40,367
No. I'm sure he's fine.

832
01:00:42,107 --> 01:00:44,548
A month ago, he had sent me some documents.

833
01:00:45,548 --> 01:00:49,248
It seemed like Chairman Yu caught wind of it,

834
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:51,318
so I told him to go somewhere safe.

835
01:00:53,917 --> 01:00:56,857
Documents? What kind of documents?

836
01:00:56,857 --> 01:00:58,728
It was about the collapse of Taejung Town.

837
01:00:59,427 --> 01:01:01,087
But there wasn't enough information.

838
01:01:01,127 --> 01:01:03,827
Did you also receive the recording?

839
01:01:04,427 --> 01:01:05,968
No, I didn't.

840
01:01:07,367 --> 01:01:11,137
He must've given you a sign.

841
01:01:11,268 --> 01:01:14,478
What is this recording you're talking about?

842
01:01:27,687 --> 01:01:29,587
Your father...

843
01:01:30,818 --> 01:01:33,887
visited me 19 years ago.

844
01:01:35,827 --> 01:01:37,397
This is evidence...

845
01:01:38,097 --> 01:01:40,698
that Yujung is responsible for the collapse of Taejung Town.

846
01:01:41,538 --> 01:01:42,998
Don't worry.

847
01:01:43,437 --> 01:01:45,708
Until I reveal Yu Seo Il's hideous face,

848
01:01:46,568 --> 01:01:47,808
I won't die.

849
01:01:48,077 --> 01:01:49,637
And they won't be able to disguise my death as a suicide.

850
01:01:59,748 --> 01:02:01,147
The next day,

851
01:02:01,788 --> 01:02:05,087
I heard that he had passed away.

852
01:02:07,427 --> 01:02:08,498
Does that mean...

853
01:02:10,298 --> 01:02:11,698
my father...

854
01:02:13,528 --> 01:02:15,498
didn't commit suicide?

855
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:16,998
Never.

856
01:02:17,738 --> 01:02:19,137
Your father said...

857
01:02:19,308 --> 01:02:22,377
he'd make sure you didn't die in vain.

858
01:02:23,038 --> 01:02:26,008
He stood in front of the rubble where you were buried...

859
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:28,147
and made that promise to you.

860
01:02:41,698 --> 01:02:43,397
The analysis result of the partial fingerprints is out.

861
01:02:47,998 --> 01:02:49,038
How did it go?

862
01:02:49,468 --> 01:02:50,468
Please sit down.

863
01:02:56,208 --> 01:02:57,978
We did identify the fingerprints,

864
01:02:59,577 --> 01:03:01,077
but there's nothing we can do with just this.

865
01:03:01,077 --> 01:03:02,278
Whose were they?

866
01:03:03,018 --> 01:03:04,548
Are you hesitant to expose him?

867
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:08,157
Find out yourself.

868
01:03:08,157 --> 01:03:12,728
(Fingerprint Analysis Result)

869
01:03:15,798 --> 01:03:19,768
(Park Joo Young)

870
01:03:24,198 --> 01:03:27,568
The true cause of the collapse is probably very different...

871
01:03:27,568 --> 01:03:28,907
from the one reported by the media.

872
01:03:28,937 --> 01:03:31,808
What was the true cause?

873
01:03:31,847 --> 01:03:34,677
Those who had investigated that case will know.

874
01:03:34,677 --> 01:03:37,048
I have nothing to say. That happened ages ago.

875
01:03:38,917 --> 01:03:40,018
You called, sir?

876
01:03:41,458 --> 01:03:42,887
I'll get going then.

877
01:03:47,228 --> 01:03:48,228
Park Joo Young.

878
01:03:48,528 --> 01:03:50,958
He's the superintendent of Ancheon Police Station.

879
01:03:54,798 --> 01:03:57,897
He's an incumbent police officer, so this is a bit sensitive.

880
01:03:59,437 --> 01:04:01,407
But we'll find nothing even if we reinvestigate.

881
01:04:03,337 --> 01:04:05,077
Kim Yoo Seok jumped...

882
01:04:05,077 --> 01:04:06,808
from an abandoned building that was going to be demolished,

883
01:04:06,808 --> 01:04:08,877
so there were probably no CCTV cameras around.

884
01:04:09,347 --> 01:04:11,818
There were no witnesses either.

885
01:04:24,528 --> 01:04:28,038
Mr. Park, I've found evidence that'll prove...

886
01:04:28,397 --> 01:04:29,667
Chairman Yu guilty.

887
01:04:29,968 --> 01:04:31,367
Let's talk in person.

888
01:04:58,627 --> 01:04:59,927
What? What are you doing?

889
01:05:03,768 --> 01:05:05,768
- Spare me! Please! - Let me go!

890
01:05:07,008 --> 01:05:09,137
Let me go!

891
01:05:09,177 --> 01:05:11,008
- Let me go! - Spare me, please!

892
01:05:12,248 --> 01:05:14,818
- Please! Don't kill me! - Let me go!

893
01:05:15,847 --> 01:05:16,948
Let go!

894
01:05:18,647 --> 01:05:19,718
Let go!

898
01:07:10,567 --> 01:07:13,237
I wasn't able to find matching parts.

01:07:14,078 --> 01:07:16,007
All I could do was fix the glass.

900
01:07:16,507 --> 01:07:18,348
It's odd though.

901
01:07:19,618 --> 01:07:20,647
What do you mean?

902
01:07:20,647 --> 01:07:22,888
Check out the time it stopped at.

903
01:07:26,257 --> 01:07:27,717
10:33pm.

904
01:07:28,757 --> 01:07:30,888
It's when you and Mr. Kim can talk on the phone.

905
01:08:44,998 --> 01:08:46,197
Ms. Han.

906
01:08:48,638 --> 01:08:50,167
What are you doing here?

907
01:09:00,417 --> 01:09:01,578
That watch...

908
01:09:05,257 --> 01:09:07,518
Why do you have that watch?

909
01:09:07,958 --> 01:09:10,458
Why do you ask? It belonged to my dad.

910
01:09:11,697 --> 01:09:15,228
That watch belonged to your dad?

911
01:09:16,197 --> 01:09:17,967
Yes, he had it when he died.

912
01:09:20,098 --> 01:09:21,567
Why do you ask though?

913
01:09:22,067 --> 01:09:23,467
Do you recognize this watch?

914
01:09:23,908 --> 01:09:24,938
Yes.

915
01:09:27,708 --> 01:09:29,178
For 31 days,

916
01:09:31,107 --> 01:09:33,078
I looked at that watch every day.

917
01:09:38,388 --> 01:09:39,958
Do you perhaps know my father?

918
01:09:40,458 --> 01:09:41,928
Before being rescued,

919
01:09:42,888 --> 01:09:44,288
I was with...

920
01:09:46,127 --> 01:09:47,558
your father.

921
01:10:33,737 --> 01:10:41,317
(Kairos)

922
01:10:41,518 --> 01:10:45,288
(Kairos)

923
01:10:53,458 --> 01:10:56,297
(Kairos)

924
01:10:56,297 --> 01:10:57,897
What should I do with what you gave me?

925
01:10:57,897 --> 01:11:01,567
I'll do anything that will help bring my daughter back.

926
01:11:03,408 --> 01:11:05,178
Did something happen to Ms. Kwak?

927
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:06,277
You jerk!

928
01:11:10,777 --> 01:11:12,317
What can I do?

929
01:11:12,317 --> 01:11:13,547
Find out for yourself.

930
01:11:13,547 --> 01:11:15,118
(Kim Seo Jin)

931
01:11:16,547 --> 01:11:17,717
Am I talking to myself?

932
01:11:17,717 --> 01:11:19,917
History will only repeat itself if we don't stop him.

933
01:11:19,917 --> 01:11:22,627
I'll die in a month anyway, so let me do this.

934
01:11:22,627 --> 01:11:26,558
Have a seat. I hear you can prove that I'm a bad man.

935
01:11:26,598 --> 01:11:28,928
You hypocrite. It's over for you.
