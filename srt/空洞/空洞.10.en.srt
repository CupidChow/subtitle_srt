00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:12,509
(September's Collaboration: Limited edition green milk tea)

2
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:13,679
Excuse me.

3
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:17,949
Yes, hello.

4
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:21,749
By any chance, is Ms. Han Ae Ri here?

5
00:00:23,589 --> 00:00:25,890
Who are you? Why are you looking for her?

6
00:00:28,167 --> 00:00:29,536
I'm from Yujung Constructions.

7
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,067
Yujung Constructions...

8
00:00:34,137 --> 00:00:35,936
Are you here because of that recent incident?

9
00:00:38,046 --> 00:00:40,546
Is she no longer working here?

10
00:00:42,046 --> 00:00:44,116
She has a great sense of responsibility.

11
00:00:44,917 --> 00:00:49,057
I told her I could wait, but she quit, saying she felt bad.

12
00:00:51,457 --> 00:00:55,697
I thought that case was solved.

13
00:00:57,127 --> 00:00:58,326
I came to ask her a few things...

14
00:00:58,326 --> 00:00:59,896
in order to prevent similar cases from occurring.

15
00:01:01,567 --> 00:01:02,637
I see.

16
00:01:04,707 --> 00:01:08,306
Sir, please treat her well.

17
00:01:08,607 --> 00:01:11,407
I have no idea how she got into that,

18
00:01:11,676 --> 00:01:13,907
but there's no one like her.

19
00:01:14,077 --> 00:01:15,446
She's hardworking, friendly,

20
00:01:15,446 --> 00:01:17,847
and is more economical than me, the manager.

21
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:20,317
About that kidnapping case,

22
00:01:20,386 --> 00:01:23,857
I'm certain she was just there to help.

23
00:01:24,487 --> 00:01:27,657
Since a month ago... Was her name Da Bin?

24
00:01:28,097 --> 00:01:30,556
She had put up the missing child flyers...

25
00:01:30,556 --> 00:01:32,426
and had looked for her everywhere.

26
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,437
I'm so upset.

27
00:01:44,306 --> 00:01:47,347
These days, she's been busy looking for her mother.

28
00:01:48,217 --> 00:01:49,217
(Have You Seen My Mom?)

29
00:01:49,217 --> 00:01:51,817
Why did she leave her house if she was ill?

30
00:01:54,317 --> 00:01:55,657
"Kwak Song Ja".

31
00:01:57,286 --> 00:01:58,457
Why does it sound familiar?

32
00:02:01,756 --> 00:02:03,857
(Calling)

33
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:06,097
(Kim Seo Jin)

34
00:02:07,597 --> 00:02:08,597
Han Ae Ri.

35
00:02:12,036 --> 00:02:13,907
(Kim Seo Jin)

36
00:02:15,506 --> 00:02:17,777
What's your relationship with Director Kim Seo Jin?

37
00:02:17,877 --> 00:02:19,147
Hello?

38
00:02:20,076 --> 00:02:21,217
Mr. Kim.

39
00:02:27,956 --> 00:02:29,617
- Hello? - Who is this?

40
00:02:31,486 --> 00:02:32,557
Director Kim?

41
00:02:34,057 --> 00:02:35,696
Who are you? Let me speak to Han Ae Ri!

42
00:02:41,097 --> 00:02:42,837
Hello? Mr. Kim.

43
00:02:42,837 --> 00:02:46,036
Ms. Han. Is that really you?

44
00:02:50,377 --> 00:02:51,706
Hello? Mr. Kim.

45
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,807
Hello? Who are you? Let me speak to Han Ae Ri!

46
00:02:55,377 --> 00:02:56,377
Director Kim?

47
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,057
Mr. Kim.

48
00:03:04,127 --> 00:03:05,127
Mr. Kim.

49
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:07,756
Hello?

50
00:03:12,467 --> 00:03:15,467
What was that? That was me on the other end.

51
00:03:49,837 --> 00:03:52,006
Why are you two in touch?

52
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:54,877
First, you snatched my phone away. And now, what are you talking about?

53
00:04:02,747 --> 00:04:03,777
(Director Kim Seo Jin)

54
00:04:07,016 --> 00:04:09,087
- Hello? - Sir.

55
00:04:09,117 --> 00:04:11,226
Hey. Why are you calling me at this hour?

56
00:04:11,527 --> 00:04:14,657
Did you just speak on the phone with Ms. Han Ae Ri?

57
00:04:15,256 --> 00:04:16,397
What do you mean?

58
00:04:17,227 --> 00:04:19,396
Why would I speak with her?

59
00:04:20,867 --> 00:04:22,636
Hello? Mr. Seo.

60
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:24,867
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:29,107
I must have been overly sensitive since I've been busy lately.

62
00:04:29,607 --> 00:04:30,836
Goodness.

63
00:04:31,607 --> 00:04:33,646
All right. Good work today. Goodnight.

64
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,956
You better explain this, Mr. Seo.

65
00:04:42,117 --> 00:04:44,057
What are you scheming?

66
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,756
Why were you looking for Lee Taek Gyu today?

67
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,167
How did you find the studio apartment?

68
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:53,367
How did you know about the studio apartment?

69
00:04:55,966 --> 00:04:57,567
Did Lee Taek Gyu tell you?

70
00:05:02,506 --> 00:05:03,537
Kwak Song Ja.

71
00:05:03,877 --> 00:05:05,846
Why is he looking for your mother?

72
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,187
What are you trying to do?

73
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:14,216
Why are you always around Mr. Kim?

74
00:05:14,216 --> 00:05:16,617
Ae Ri. Who are you?

75
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,857
- What's going on? - Who is he?

76
00:05:21,826 --> 00:05:24,367
I asked you who you were. What's this about?

77
00:05:37,877 --> 00:05:38,946
Are you okay?

78
00:05:46,687 --> 00:05:50,617
(Text message records)

79
00:05:51,287 --> 00:05:54,526
They were always in touch at 10:33pm sharp.

80
00:05:56,026 --> 00:05:57,427
If you're really from the future,

81
00:05:57,427 --> 00:05:58,997
- please help me. - These are the winning numbers...

82
00:05:58,997 --> 00:06:00,096
for the 1st lottery on the 3rd week of August.

83
00:06:00,096 --> 00:06:01,596
Will you trust me this time?

84
00:06:02,497 --> 00:06:07,067
If these were sent a month after Han Ae Ri had sent the texts...

85
00:06:07,877 --> 00:06:10,636
A woman named Han Ae Ri had visited Kim Jin Ho last night.

86
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:12,977
Da Bin will be kidnapped by Kim Jin Ho.

87
00:06:12,977 --> 00:06:14,477
Let go of me. It's not me.

88
00:06:14,646 --> 00:06:16,716
It's him! You must catch him!

89
00:06:22,057 --> 00:06:23,716
Hello? Who are you? Let me speak to Han Ae Ri!

90
00:06:25,326 --> 00:06:26,656
Director Kim?

91
00:06:27,557 --> 00:06:28,756
Mr. Kim.

92
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:30,956
Mr. Kim.

93
00:06:44,646 --> 00:06:45,677
Hyun Chae.

94
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:50,747
I've finally figured out...

95
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:55,656
why this happened to me.

96
00:07:02,497 --> 00:07:03,927
I can bring you back to life.

97
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:11,466
I will do that...

98
00:07:15,336 --> 00:07:16,477
at all costs.

99
00:07:25,187 --> 00:07:27,646
(Episode 10)

100
00:07:32,756 --> 00:07:35,396
(Just be safe, Mr. Kim. Everything will change by tomorrow.)

101
00:07:35,396 --> 00:07:38,596
Mr. Kim, are you okay?

102
00:07:41,096 --> 00:07:44,466
Many things have happened while we were out of touch.

103
00:07:45,206 --> 00:07:46,406
Do you know that?

104
00:07:48,406 --> 00:07:51,776
My mom seems to be very ill.

105
00:07:53,076 --> 00:07:54,107
I...

106
00:07:55,177 --> 00:07:57,377
need your help once again.

107
00:07:59,317 --> 00:08:00,846
Please find her.

108
00:08:01,456 --> 00:08:04,987
(I need your help once again. Please find her.)

109
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:13,127
On the 10th, the mayor of Taejung...

110
00:08:13,127 --> 00:08:16,797
and members of Yujung Constructions met with each other.

111
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:19,167
And we finally signed the contract...

112
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:21,477
regarding Taejung's development.

113
00:08:22,737 --> 00:08:25,776
In compliance with our agreement, the city hall will be in charge...

114
00:08:25,776 --> 00:08:27,677
of the working design and the impact assessment.

115
00:08:27,877 --> 00:08:29,417
Yujung Constructions...

116
00:08:29,547 --> 00:08:31,747
will be in charge of readjusting the re-plotting land.

117
00:08:31,917 --> 00:08:34,187
How do the landowners feel about this?

118
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:36,917
We held a briefing session yesterday and invited all the residents.

119
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:38,486
The number of people who were against this...

120
00:08:38,486 --> 00:08:39,826
had gone down significantly.

121
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,096
We've also prepared an analysis of a survey...

122
00:08:44,096 --> 00:08:45,596
we had handed out after the briefing session.

123
00:08:46,366 --> 00:08:48,996
Please look at the paper we've given you.

124
00:08:49,267 --> 00:08:51,267
Please look at the results of the number five question.

125
00:08:51,366 --> 00:08:52,767
There has been a 17.6-percent increase...

126
00:08:52,937 --> 00:08:56,836
post briefing session regarding the residents...

127
00:08:56,976 --> 00:08:59,576
feeling hopeful and thinking Taejung New Town project...

128
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:01,076
would benefit them.

129
00:09:01,476 --> 00:09:03,616
This is a good start.

130
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:07,787
The speech you gave yesterday played a huge role.

131
00:09:07,986 --> 00:09:09,057
Good work.

132
00:09:13,126 --> 00:09:15,356
It's all thanks to the Planning Department's...

133
00:09:15,356 --> 00:09:16,897
excellent planning and support.

134
00:09:18,096 --> 00:09:21,466
Before ending, I would like...

135
00:09:21,836 --> 00:09:25,236
to introduce our new team manager.

136
00:09:26,267 --> 00:09:27,606
It's Team Manager Seo Do Kyun.

137
00:09:30,976 --> 00:09:32,446
- Who? - Who is that?

138
00:09:32,507 --> 00:09:35,076
- What's going on? - How could this be?

139
00:09:35,076 --> 00:09:37,246
- Isn't he one of his men? - He is.

140
00:09:37,246 --> 00:09:38,317
Goodness.

141
00:09:38,317 --> 00:09:41,687
He was the one who led the Cheonan project...

142
00:09:41,787 --> 00:09:44,057
which we reaped the most fruits from this year.

143
00:09:44,826 --> 00:09:48,326
The entire project was overseen by him.

144
00:09:48,856 --> 00:09:51,366
I believe he has proven himself...

145
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,596
and is eligible enough to play a crucial role...

146
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,537
in this Taejung project which will lead Yujung's future.

147
00:09:55,937 --> 00:09:57,907
Everyone will be quite busy.

148
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:01,976
Mr. Seo. I mean, Team Manager Seo...

149
00:10:02,277 --> 00:10:05,777
and everyone else, you better stay alert...

150
00:10:05,777 --> 00:10:07,106
until the construction begins.

151
00:10:07,547 --> 00:10:09,576
Help Director Kim as much as possible.

152
00:10:19,557 --> 00:10:21,187
I must've taken you by surprise.

153
00:10:22,826 --> 00:10:24,027
Let's do a good job once again.

154
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:28,096
I'll put together a report...

155
00:10:28,297 --> 00:10:30,037
including everything that was announced today.

156
00:10:30,037 --> 00:10:31,096
Sure.

157
00:10:31,767 --> 00:10:34,876
It's already time for lunch when I barely have time to spare.

158
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:37,437
Let's quickly grab a bite to eat.

159
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:39,547
You'll be accompanying me this afternoon.

160
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:54,557
It was this guy, right? Seo Do Kyun of Yujung Constructions.

161
00:10:54,726 --> 00:10:56,126
That's the guy we saw you with.

162
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,567
Where did you get this?

163
00:10:59,966 --> 00:11:01,897
Our boss at the convenience store.

164
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:04,466
He came looking for you yesterday...

165
00:11:05,137 --> 00:11:07,507
and asked about you in detail.

166
00:11:08,336 --> 00:11:11,137
That's why the jerk was at your house last night.

167
00:11:11,807 --> 00:11:15,547
We need to find my mom before they do.

168
00:11:23,456 --> 00:11:25,787
- Hello? - Yes, hello.

169
00:11:27,057 --> 00:11:31,157
Are you perhaps related to Ms. Kwak Song Ja?

170
00:11:33,267 --> 00:11:35,637
Yes, I am. I'm her daughter.

171
00:11:36,767 --> 00:11:37,866
May I ask who's calling?

172
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:42,476
(Yujung Constructions Must Answer to the Taejung Town Accident)

173
00:11:42,476 --> 00:11:43,736
This is...

174
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:46,576
the Taejung Town Collapse Victims' Association.

175
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:50,476
Taejung Town?

176
00:11:52,047 --> 00:11:53,787
We're on our way to meet...

177
00:11:53,917 --> 00:11:56,986
with the Taejung Town Collapse Victims' Association.

178
00:11:58,387 --> 00:12:00,557
Due to the lack of trust they have in us,

179
00:12:00,557 --> 00:12:02,596
they have been adamantly opposed to this project.

180
00:12:02,826 --> 00:12:04,496
Talking to them won't be easy.

181
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:07,196
Didn't you say what you could at yesterday's presentation?

182
00:12:07,826 --> 00:12:10,236
A few words can't make up for all the damage.

183
00:12:10,466 --> 00:12:12,767
A one-time apology might antagonize them even more.

184
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:14,836
Until the project is complete,

185
00:12:15,807 --> 00:12:17,106
we must keep apologizing.

186
00:12:21,777 --> 00:12:22,876
Sir,

187
00:12:24,017 --> 00:12:25,787
could this change of heart...

188
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,616
be influenced by Han Ae Ri?

189
00:12:29,986 --> 00:12:31,057
What?

190
00:12:33,057 --> 00:12:35,927
That reminds me. What was with that call last night?

191
00:12:37,797 --> 00:12:40,226
I didn't know she'd show up at the presentation.

192
00:12:41,397 --> 00:12:43,667
I'm worried of her being more of a threat.

193
00:12:45,206 --> 00:12:46,466
In any way,

194
00:12:47,106 --> 00:12:49,307
you'd be better off staying away from her.

195
00:12:49,637 --> 00:12:51,907
Don't worry. We won't ever come in contact again.

196
00:12:53,476 --> 00:12:54,746
However,

197
00:12:56,346 --> 00:12:58,517
what she said at the police station...

198
00:12:59,147 --> 00:13:00,687
still feels like a hoax,

199
00:13:01,216 --> 00:13:02,956
but something has changed in me...

200
00:13:03,757 --> 00:13:05,456
ever since that concert.

Whether for the best or not...

202
00:13:09,096 --> 00:13:10,927
is still undetermined at the moment.

If you're here for my opinion, don't expect it to be good.

226
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:10,007
The new project itself is just wrong to begin with.

227
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:13,407
Then enlighten us. We're all ears, sir.

228
00:16:16,547 --> 00:16:17,846
Do you know...

229
00:16:18,216 --> 00:16:20,616
why tragedies like this keep on happening in Korea?

230
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:25,226
Because only the executive lowest on the totem pole...

231
00:16:25,226 --> 00:16:26,726
is ever punished.

232
00:16:27,326 --> 00:16:29,496
The specific cause of why Taejung Town collapsed...

233
00:16:29,496 --> 00:16:31,126
should've been investigated.

234
00:16:31,126 --> 00:16:33,167
That's the only way to prevent further incidents.

235
00:16:33,696 --> 00:16:37,297
However, Yujung Constructions took the first wrong step.

236
00:16:39,907 --> 00:16:41,206
Are you saying that...

237
00:16:41,206 --> 00:16:42,807
the initial investigation was inadequate?

238
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:47,476
Banyoung Constructions who was in charge...

239
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,946
didn't consider the possibility of a sink hole...

240
00:16:49,946 --> 00:16:53,986
Mr. Kim, do you actually believe the words of Yu Seo Il?

241
00:16:55,387 --> 00:16:57,856
So that the bereaved don't discover anything damning,

242
00:16:57,856 --> 00:16:59,757
Chairman Yu has been...

243
00:16:59,757 --> 00:17:02,427
holding information back and covering up certain facts.

244
00:17:03,826 --> 00:17:06,067
If you're not interested...

245
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,797
in hearing the words of the bereaved or those who survived,

246
00:17:08,967 --> 00:17:10,666

249
00:17:21,247 --> 00:17:24,576
Could I then have the list of the bereaved?

if you have the time,

I'd like to hear about my father.

259

As you know, I was caved in at the site...

263
00:18:27,777 --> 00:18:29,146
was my mentor.

264
00:18:30,047 --> 00:18:31,646
Since his days as a chief,

265
00:18:32,547 --> 00:18:34,317
I learned a lot from him.

If I ever got the chance to meet you,

267
00:18:42,156 --> 00:18:43,826
this I wanted to say.

268
00:18:45,727 --> 00:18:47,396
Your father isn't the kind of man...

269

Of course, I don't have any evidence to back it up.

271
00:18:55,106 --> 00:18:58,076
As you can guess, it happened while I was...

272
00:18:58,076 --> 00:18:59,807
fighting for my life at the hospital.

273
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:03,247
Yoo Seok came by though when I woke up.

274
00:19:04,247 --> 00:19:07,287
I couldn't even begin to imagine the agony he felt...

believed that you'd come back to him.

278
00:19:16,926 --> 00:19:19,767
More so than anyone, he aggressively fought...

279
00:19:19,767 --> 00:19:22,336
to figure out why the accident happened.

280
00:19:22,336 --> 00:19:23,436
And I'm sure...

281
00:19:24,896 --> 00:19:27,537

284

Did you call him?

00:22:16,737 --> 00:22:19,876
Why did you come this far? I said I'll call you when we're sure.

We'll call you after we're done investigating, so please leave.

- Is this the car? - That's as far as you can come.

307

You can't cross this line.

308
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:29,957
It looks right, but we're waiting for the test result from the NFS.

309
00:22:30,586 --> 00:22:31,717
What more do you need to test?

310
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:33,527
People say there's a connection even if you brush by someone,

311
00:22:33,656 --> 00:22:35,757
so when someone brushes by something, there's always a trace.

312
00:22:38,027 --> 00:22:41,697
The skid marks left on the road show the type of wheels that are used.

313
00:22:42,037 --> 00:22:44,237
We're checking to see if these tires match the skid marks.

314
00:22:45,467 --> 00:22:47,836
And the damage on this truck coincides...

315
00:22:47,836 --> 00:22:49,836
with the height of the damage made on the victim's car.

316
00:22:50,106 --> 00:22:51,436
And lastly, the paint.

317
00:22:51,676 --> 00:22:54,807
It's not visible to the naked eye. But by using a spectroscope,

318
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:56,947
we'll see if the paint left on the damage...

319
00:22:56,947 --> 00:22:58,787
is the same type of paint used on the victim's car.

320
00:22:58,817 --> 00:23:00,146
If so, it's game over.

321
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:01,586

A resident around here reported this car as abandoned for days.

325

341
00:25:05,277 --> 00:25:07,947
It reduces his anxiety and calms him down.

342

I know him very well.

361
00:26:53,886 --> 00:26:55,557
I've worked with him for years.

362
00:26:56,416 --> 00:26:59,326
It must've been traumatic for your mother.

363
00:27:00,626 --> 00:27:02,186
We tried our best...

364
00:27:02,396 --> 00:27:04,727
to contact her as the Victims' Association,

365
00:27:04,896 --> 00:27:06,866
but we couldn't find her whereabouts.

366
00:27:07,197 --> 00:27:10,737
But I saw your name on the list of visitors...

367
00:27:10,737 --> 00:27:12,866
at the presentation yesterday...

368
00:27:13,136 --> 00:27:16,136
and wanted to see if you were Tae Gil's family, so I called.

369
00:27:16,336 --> 00:27:17,406
I see.

370
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:21,176
It's my first time meeting someone who's acquainted with my dad.

371
00:27:24,646 --> 00:27:28,247
Director Kim Seo Jin of Yujung Constructions was just here.

372
00:27:30,787 --> 00:27:34,126
His father, your father,

373
00:27:34,287 --> 00:27:37,326
and I were all very close.

374
00:27:39,567 --> 00:27:40,896
Who was that again?

375
00:27:42,497 --> 00:27:44,136
Who else was close to my dad?

376
00:27:44,237 --> 00:27:47,507
Director Kim Seo Jin's father, Mr. Kim Yoo Seok.

377
00:27:50,906 --> 00:27:53,277
They had been close?

378
00:27:53,707 --> 00:27:54,747
Of course.

379
00:27:56,317 --> 00:27:58,076
Back then, Yoo Seok ran around...

380
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:01,017
trying to find the cause of the collapse.

381
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:04,356
I'm sure he met with your mother too.

Where did I see her?

387
00:28:35,957 --> 00:28:37,656
I'm sure I've seen her somewhere.

388
00:28:45,497 --> 00:28:47,366
Are you talking about the Cheonan project?

389
00:28:47,396 --> 00:28:49,497
Yes, the Cheonan project.

390
00:28:50,267 --> 00:28:51,866
Seo Jin said...

391
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:55,537
you were the actual head of the entire project.

392
00:28:56,606 --> 00:28:59,547
It's only because Mr. Kim guided me very well...

393
00:28:59,547 --> 00:29:01,007
You just have to wrap it up.

394
00:29:01,247 --> 00:29:02,576
Just do things as you've always done.

395
00:29:03,017 --> 00:29:05,416
I need Seo Jin elsewhere.

396
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:08,886
Yes, sir.

397
00:29:13,686 --> 00:29:14,727
You may go.

398
00:29:26,567 --> 00:29:28,436
(Please help me find my missing mom.)

399
00:29:33,777 --> 00:29:35,176
Why did she there to see Chairman Yu?

400
00:29:42,757 --> 00:29:44,517
- Hey, Hyun Chae. - Where are you?

401
00:29:44,856 --> 00:29:46,287
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

402
00:29:47,826 --> 00:29:49,297
I'm almost there. See you upstairs.

403
00:29:51,896 --> 00:29:54,697
I've come to a conclusion regarding what Han Ae Ri said.

404
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:56,596
What is it?

405
00:29:57,737 --> 00:30:00,106
The text messages she claims to have gone...

406
00:30:00,106 --> 00:30:01,936
back and forth between her and Kim...

407
00:30:02,876 --> 00:30:05,906
seemed to be too accurate for her to have imagined everything,

408
00:30:05,906 --> 00:30:07,007
so I was a bit worried.

409
00:30:07,747 --> 00:30:08,876
But?

410
00:30:09,447 --> 00:30:10,717
What I do know is...

411
00:30:10,876 --> 00:30:13,487
that she hasn't been in touch with Kim Seo Jin.

412
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:16,856
But her mother has met with Chairman Yu.

413
00:30:21,326 --> 00:30:23,057
Why did her mother see him?

414
00:30:23,326 --> 00:30:25,096
She's a bereaved family member of a victim...

415
00:30:25,396 --> 00:30:26,666
in the Taejung Town collapse.

416
00:30:29,067 --> 00:30:30,896
Her mother came to see the chairman...

417
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:33,037
when Han Ae Ri was arrested for attempted kidnapping.

418
00:30:33,967 --> 00:30:36,336
I guess she wanted to ask him to show mercy.

419
00:30:43,317 --> 00:30:45,176
That's why I plan to start it again.

420
00:30:46,987 --> 00:30:47,987
Start what?

421
00:30:48,987 --> 00:30:50,517
The plan for us to leave this place together.

422
00:30:56,997 --> 00:30:59,697
So please don't be anxious,

423
00:31:00,697 --> 00:31:02,067
and give me a little more time.

424
00:31:03,636 --> 00:31:07,136
Why should I be anxious? You'll take care of everything.

425
00:31:12,376 --> 00:31:14,207
Should we go out this weekend?

426
00:31:15,247 --> 00:31:17,047
Sure. Sounds great.

Excuse me.

What is this?

434
00:32:40,527 --> 00:32:41,596
Come outside.

435
00:32:50,576 --> 00:32:53,207
Why? Why did you do that?

436
00:32:58,277 --> 00:32:59,517
Have you gone insane?

437
00:33:06,727 --> 00:33:08,027
Why did you kill Hyun Chae?

438
00:33:10,626 --> 00:33:12,227
It's driving me crazy too.

439
00:33:12,697 --> 00:33:15,096
Kang Hyun Chae put me up for this!

440
00:33:16,596 --> 00:33:17,866
You need to hear me out.

441
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:24,277
What do you mean, she put you up for this?

442
00:33:24,277 --> 00:33:26,947
She paid me to kill Kim Seo Jin.

443
00:33:28,346 --> 00:33:31,047
And she found a place without any security cameras.

444
00:33:31,247 --> 00:33:32,916
Once Kim Seo Jin takes his medicine and falls asleep,

445
00:33:32,916 --> 00:33:34,846
she said she'll take her kid and get out of the car.

446
00:33:35,987 --> 00:33:38,017
She said only Kim Seo Jin will die,

447
00:33:38,457 --> 00:33:41,457
so I have no idea why she was in the car.

448
00:33:42,527 --> 00:33:44,396

I can catch up on my work after the trip.

You don't have to go out of your way to do this if you're busy.

You must be exhausted.

490

ask Mr. Seo Do Kyun for help.

I'm sure he knows that Mr. Seo was also at that studio apartment.

524
00:40:18,777 --> 00:40:20,976
I know who did it. It was Lee Taek Gyu.

525
00:40:21,306 --> 00:40:24,447
You must kill him before October 9.

526

I beg you. If you kill him...

527
00:40:27,986 --> 00:40:31,286
If you kill him, I'll do whatever you want me to do.

528
00:40:31,616 --> 00:40:33,317
He wants me to kill Lee Taek Gyu?

Why are you here?

Am I not allowed here?

I'm giving Seo Jin a quick visit.

00:41:28,507 --> 00:41:30,416
I had some errands to run nearby, so I just dropped by.

537
00:41:30,546 --> 00:41:32,246
I thought we could have lunch together.

538
00:41:33,017 --> 00:41:34,986
What should I do? I have a luncheon appointment.

539
00:41:35,286 --> 00:41:38,587
I won't be coming to work tomorrow, so I have a lot to do today.

540
00:41:39,317 --> 00:41:42,687
Don't worry about it. I came unannounced anyway.

541
00:41:43,527 --> 00:41:44,827
Would you like something to drink at least?

542
00:41:45,197 --> 00:41:46,897
No, thanks. You should work.

543
00:41:47,327 --> 00:41:48,926
I don't want you to cancel our trip tomorrow...

544
00:41:48,926 --> 00:41:50,496
because I bothered you today.

545
00:41:50,637 --> 00:41:52,296
- Let me walk outside with you. - Just work.

546
00:41:52,437 --> 00:41:54,236
At least until the elevator.

547
00:42:05,277 --> 00:42:07,286
You drove, right? Which floor did you park at?

548
00:42:07,387 --> 00:42:08,616
Third level basement.

549
00:42:12,056 --> 00:42:13,286
It was your first time visiting in a long time.

550
00:42:13,286 --> 00:42:14,926
I'm sorry we couldn't have lunch.

551
00:42:15,457 --> 00:42:17,897
It's okay. We're going on a trip anyway. Bye.

552
00:42:18,127 --> 00:42:19,127
Bye.

553
00:42:20,027 --> 00:42:21,267

556
00:42:36,077 --> 00:42:39,116
Hey, didn't I tell you to never contact him again?

557
00:42:39,846 --> 00:42:40,947
Do you want to get into a mess again?

558
00:42:40,947 --> 00:42:43,187
That's why I'm telling you about this first.

559
00:42:44,286 --> 00:42:45,286
And...

560
00:42:46,156 --> 00:42:48,527
I visited the Taejung Town Collapse Victims' Association...

561
00:42:50,226 --> 00:42:53,226
and found out that my father was close with his.

562
00:42:55,627 --> 00:42:57,337
All the new information I've been discovering...

563
00:42:57,337 --> 00:42:58,967
is pointing toward one fact.

564
00:43:00,236 --> 00:43:01,937
That my mom's disappearance...

565
00:43:02,707 --> 00:43:04,906
is linked with Yujung Constructions.

566
00:43:05,476 --> 00:43:06,536
I must...

567
00:43:07,846 --> 00:43:09,676
stay in touch with him.

568
00:43:14,046 --> 00:43:15,387
So what do you want to do?

569
00:43:16,746 --> 00:43:18,687
This last part sounded strange.

570
00:43:23,527 --> 00:43:26,897
If you kill Taek Gyu, I'll do whatever you want me to do.

571
00:43:27,067 --> 00:43:29,996
There's no way he would want me to ask Mr. Seo for help.

572
00:43:30,437 --> 00:43:32,096
The Kim Seo Jin I know...

573
00:43:32,797 --> 00:43:34,807
wouldn't ask me to kill anyone.

574
00:43:38,707 --> 00:43:41,947
Who else other than us knows that you two were in touch?

575
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:43,146
No one...

576
00:43:45,547 --> 00:43:47,016
The police do.

577
00:43:48,346 --> 00:43:50,856
They printed out all the texts during my interrogation.

578
00:43:51,187 --> 00:43:54,657
What if someone got their hands on those texts?

579
00:43:55,026 --> 00:43:58,856

Would you like to call him?

591
00:44:54,047 --> 00:44:55,447
No, it's not urgent.

592
00:44:55,616 --> 00:44:57,087
Please tell him to come when you see him.

593
00:44:57,986 --> 00:44:59,356
We should continue our chat.

00:45:04,427 --> 00:45:05,657

What do you mean?

597
00:45:07,827 --> 00:45:11,766
If it's something reasonable, there's no need to hide it from me.

598
00:45:13,766 --> 00:45:18,577
I don't know if you truly want Mr. Kim to be safe.

I don't know what kind of picture you've imagined in your head,

600
00:45:25,616 --> 00:45:27,746
but back off if this is related to Director Kim.

601

604

How will he be able to find your mother?

606
00:45:44,667 --> 00:45:47,136

607
00:45:47,207 --> 00:45:48,337

so get some rest.

00:54:54,089 --> 00:54:56,028
I'll decide on the location too.

714
00:54:57,428 --> 00:54:59,198
Sounds good.

715
00:55:02,028 --> 00:55:03,968
Da Bin, you should eat your meat.

716
00:55:04,238 --> 00:55:05,268
Here.

717
00:55:06,738 --> 00:55:08,168
- Say, "Ah." - Ah.

718
00:55:09,938 --> 00:55:11,938
- Wasn't it grilled properly? - It was.

719
00:55:14,139 --> 00:55:17,478
Meanwhile, I'll have some cheese.

720
00:55:27,258 --> 00:55:29,188
(Kim Seo Jin)

721
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:33,698
Wasn't it Hanjoon Sauna in Gangwon Province?

722
00:55:34,159 --> 00:55:35,968
I couldn't find the memo I wrote down the address on though.

723
00:55:36,228 --> 00:55:37,268
I'm sorry.

724
00:55:37,369 --> 00:55:39,039
(I'm sorry.)

725
00:55:39,139 --> 00:55:41,869
(Kim Seo Jin)

726
00:55:47,008 --> 00:55:48,649
(Han Ae Ri)

727
00:56:06,258 --> 00:56:07,998
(Han Ae Ri)

728
00:56:10,329 --> 00:56:12,198
Mr. Kim, where are you?

729
00:56:13,938 --> 00:56:15,639
What happened to you?

730
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,738
Are you sure you're in no condition to talk?

731
00:56:22,309 --> 00:56:23,978
Answer me, Seo Do Kyun.

732
00:56:41,528 --> 00:56:42,629
(Delete message)

733
00:57:41,659 --> 00:57:43,428
If you're not going to die, wake up already.

734
00:57:46,458 --> 00:57:47,829
You must wake up...

735
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:51,569
for Hyun Chae to be saved.

736
00:58:33,238 --> 00:58:34,309
Sir?

737
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:41,188
- Did he get a CT scan yesterday? - Yes.

738
00:58:41,619 --> 00:58:42,718
Mr. Kim?

739
00:58:44,619 --> 00:58:45,659
Mr. Kim.

740
00:58:46,819 --> 00:58:47,889
Mr. Kim.

741
00:58:50,028 --> 00:58:52,129
Please move your hand if you can hear me.

742
00:58:52,329 --> 00:58:53,528
Pinch me.

743
00:58:58,569 --> 00:59:00,399
Mr. Kim, do you hear me?

744
00:59:08,478 --> 00:59:10,008
How is he?

745
00:59:10,149 --> 00:59:12,349
He's not completely lucid just yet.

746
00:59:12,478 --> 00:59:16,248
He is not in the state of staying awake on his own...

747
00:59:16,248 --> 00:59:21,228
or being aware of his surroundings, people, places, and time.

748
00:59:21,629 --> 00:59:24,258
When do you think he could speak with us?

749
00:59:24,359 --> 00:59:27,399
For now, it's still uncertain. This is already a miracle.

750
00:59:27,869 --> 00:59:29,998
- I see. Thank you. - Goodbye.

751
00:59:42,708 --> 00:59:43,809
What did the doctor say?

752
00:59:44,178 --> 00:59:46,549
He's not fully awake just yet.

753
00:59:47,819 --> 00:59:49,549
When will he be able to talk?

754
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:51,149
He doesn't know either.

755
00:59:53,758 --> 00:59:54,789
Mr. Seo.

756
00:59:56,488 --> 00:59:59,059
I heard you were in the room when he first woke up.

757
01:00:01,498 --> 01:00:02,869
Why were you there?

758
01:00:05,498 --> 01:00:06,539
Ever since the accident,

759
01:00:06,539 --> 01:00:08,268
I've been visiting him from time to time.

760
01:00:09,569 --> 01:00:11,639
The company is extremely concerned...

761
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:14,109
about his well-being as well.

762
01:00:16,748 --> 01:00:17,809
I see.

763
01:00:18,218 --> 01:00:20,778
We'll stay here, so you can leave.

764
01:00:35,829 --> 01:00:42,539
(Emergency)

765
01:00:43,369 --> 01:00:44,678
Have you gotten in touch with her guardian?

766
01:00:45,079 --> 01:00:46,778
No, she didn't have a phone on her,

767
01:00:46,778 --> 01:00:48,079
and we couldn't find her family either.

768
01:00:48,508 --> 01:00:50,178
I found her ID card, so I checked,

769
01:00:50,178 --> 01:00:51,819
but she had never visited our hospital.

770
01:00:56,849 --> 01:01:00,218
She could've run away from home, so let the health department know.

771
01:01:00,518 --> 01:01:01,528
Okay.

772
01:01:03,289 --> 01:01:06,599
So who has Mr. Kim's phone right now?

773
01:01:06,899 --> 01:01:08,099
It's not him for sure.

774
01:01:08,299 --> 01:01:09,728
How do you know?

775
01:01:10,869 --> 01:01:12,599
Remember Jeonghui Diner?

776
01:01:13,399 --> 01:01:14,468
He didn't recognize that place.

777
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:17,069
That fraudster.

778
01:01:17,738 --> 01:01:19,238
Then it's Seo Do Kyun.

779
01:01:21,309 --> 01:01:22,349
Hold on.

780
01:01:22,809 --> 01:01:26,049
Does that mean he knows that you and Kim Seo Jin...

781
01:01:26,278 --> 01:01:28,119
are in different time frames?

782
01:01:28,389 --> 01:01:29,448
I think so.

783
01:01:29,889 --> 01:01:33,059
He's trying to use me to prevent Kang Hyun Chae's death.

784
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:36,289
Anyway, I'm positive that something will happen to Mr. Kim in a month.

785
01:01:39,458 --> 01:01:42,268
So for now, you can't reach him.

786
01:01:42,629 --> 01:01:44,299
I think it's all for the best.

787
01:01:45,139 --> 01:01:48,339
Forget everything about him. Pretend like it was all a dream.

788
01:01:48,909 --> 01:01:49,968
Please?

789
01:01:55,248 --> 01:01:56,278
Hello, Detective Choi.

790
01:01:56,649 --> 01:01:59,649
Ms. Han, I think I found your mother.

791
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:01,918
She had recently gone to a hospital.

792
01:02:02,488 --> 01:02:03,488
Are you serious?

793
01:02:03,688 --> 01:02:06,659
I took a look at her medical record.

794
01:02:07,488 --> 01:02:09,829
But I should go there myself and check if she's really there.

795
01:02:10,228 --> 01:02:12,758
Which hospital is it? I'll go there right now.

796
01:02:13,428 --> 01:02:14,428
He found her?

797
01:02:28,879 --> 01:02:29,879
Come in.

798
01:02:34,918 --> 01:02:35,988
Hey.

799
01:02:36,649 --> 01:02:38,589
I heard Seo Jin regained consciousness.

800
01:02:39,488 --> 01:02:41,258
So? Did you talk with him?

801
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:43,859
He can't talk yet.

802
01:02:44,428 --> 01:02:47,629
But there's a high chance that he'll recover soon.

803
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:49,668
That's a relief.

804
01:02:49,968 --> 01:02:51,839
I'm glad he didn't get any more injuries.

805
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:56,268
Seo Jin will overcome this hardship as well.

806
01:02:56,468 --> 01:02:59,579
Right. He wouldn't give up due to something so trivial.

807
01:03:00,409 --> 01:03:04,208
By the way, how will we tell him about his family?

808
01:03:10,149 --> 01:03:11,218
Yes?

809
01:03:13,258 --> 01:03:14,389
Minister Park?

810
01:03:15,488 --> 01:03:16,758
Put him through.

811
01:03:21,129 --> 01:03:22,299
I know.

812
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:25,369
Director Kim woke up.

813
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:31,508
This won't affect the Taejung Project.

814
01:03:33,238 --> 01:03:34,809
Don't worry.

815
01:03:36,609 --> 01:03:40,018
Business is important, but people come first.

816
01:03:44,448 --> 01:03:45,819
I see.

817
01:03:46,619 --> 01:03:47,958
Goodbye.

818
01:04:01,069 --> 01:04:02,668
Ae Ri?

819
01:04:10,208 --> 01:04:11,549
Are you awake?

820
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:16,049
How did you come here?

821
01:04:22,059 --> 01:04:23,688
There's someone I need to see.

822
01:04:47,149 --> 01:04:49,018
(Lee Taek Gyu)

823
01:05:21,218 --> 01:05:22,289
Of course.

824
01:05:23,948 --> 01:05:25,018
Bye.

825
01:05:33,958 --> 01:05:35,028
Cancelled.

826
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:39,468
Going up.

827
01:05:41,569 --> 01:05:43,438
I know that you were working for someone else as well...

828
01:05:43,438 --> 01:05:44,609
when you were working for Do Kyun.

829
01:05:46,879 --> 01:05:48,309
Who's paying you?

830
01:05:48,478 --> 01:05:50,208
Who's looking for Han Ae Ri's mother?

831
01:05:50,208 --> 01:05:51,948
What's it to you?

832
01:05:53,918 --> 01:05:55,748
You just need Kim Seo Jin dead.

833
01:06:07,698 --> 01:06:09,768
Wealthy people are so funny.

834
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:11,738
It was Chairman Yu Seo Il.

835
01:06:12,799 --> 01:06:15,208
He wanted me to find out where Han Ae Ri's mom was.

836
01:06:15,208 --> 01:06:18,409
- Why? - I don't know. I don't care either.

837
01:06:20,639 --> 01:06:21,879
Did he give her money as well?

838
01:06:23,409 --> 01:06:25,518
(Text message records)

839
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:30,819
(Please found out who wired 100,000 dollars to my mom.)

840
01:06:30,819 --> 01:06:33,659
Did you send 100,000 dollars to her on August 27?

841
01:06:35,859 --> 01:06:37,289
Chairman Yu did that, didn't he?

842
01:06:41,028 --> 01:06:42,168
Then did you think it was my money?

843
01:06:46,768 --> 01:06:48,409
She...

844
01:06:50,369 --> 01:06:51,569
has something.

845
01:07:18,839 --> 01:07:19,938
Are you awake?

846
01:07:21,968 --> 01:07:23,539
Where is that recording?

847
01:07:29,178 --> 01:07:31,948
Where's your lifeline?

848
01:08:16,389 --> 01:08:17,589
(Kairos)

849
01:08:17,589 --> 01:08:19,799
Mom, do you know a man named Kim Yoo Seok?

850
01:08:19,799 --> 01:08:22,299
- Keep it for the time being. - What is this?

851
01:08:22,498 --> 01:08:25,768
Tell me everything. What is this that you're keeping from me?

852
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:28,369
They tried to get rid of people's homes. That's absurd.

853
01:08:28,369 --> 01:08:29,809
What's the real cause?

854
01:08:29,938 --> 01:08:32,438
They keep talking about it. It's getting too noisy.

855
01:08:32,438 --> 01:08:34,309
- It will be that road. - And the date?

856
01:08:34,309 --> 01:08:36,049
We'll have a family trip on October 9.

857
01:08:36,178 --> 01:08:37,379
It will work no matter what.

858
01:08:37,379 --> 01:08:39,619
Mr. Kim had accelerated right before the crash.

859
01:08:39,718 --> 01:08:41,549
Were you trying to commit suicide together?

860
01:08:41,549 --> 01:08:42,549
That's nonsense.

861
01:08:42,549 --> 01:08:44,218
Mr. Kim, you'll be interrogated.

862
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:45,619
Hire a lawyer if needed.

863
01:08:45,619 --> 01:08:47,718
Kim Seo Jin! Stay where you are!
