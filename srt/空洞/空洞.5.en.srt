I'm here to see the manager.

00:00:41,385 --> 00:00:42,422
Pardon?

5
00:00:44,292 --> 00:00:45,992
Hey, turn off the music!

6
00:00:49,462 --> 00:00:50,562
How may I help you again?

00:00:54,632 --> 00:00:55,871
Oh, the manager.

Are you Ms. Kang Hyun Chae?

11
00:01:04,371 --> 00:01:06,511
- Yes. - I see. Come this way.

12
00:01:22,061 --> 00:01:23,231
Kang Hyun Chae?

13
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,281
You can take this.

14
00:01:48,891 --> 00:01:51,651
I live nearby. Or I can just sleep in the bar.

15
00:01:52,322 --> 00:01:55,292
No, it's okay. You shouldn't get that wet, right?

16

How much do you get paid here?

Do you want to leave with me now?

23

I'll pay you in advance.

24

Come on, it's your pay.

25
00:03:17,942 --> 00:03:21,581
Man, you must know you're pretty to be acting so haughty.

26

What's this? Do you play this too?

27
00:03:27,222 --> 00:03:28,322
Get your hands off.

28
00:03:28,622 --> 00:03:30,521
Yes, so let's grab a drink.

29

Get your hands off my instrument.

30
00:03:34,062 --> 00:03:35,961

You got me fired.

35
00:04:13,444 --> 00:04:16,373
Sorry. Oh, I'm sorry.

36
00:04:18,313 --> 00:04:20,414
It looks like you got fired because of me too.

Okay, sure.

39
00:04:26,553 --> 00:04:27,854
Why are you speaking casually to me?

40
00:04:28,354 --> 00:04:30,024
I thought you were younger than me.

41
00:04:31,454 --> 00:04:32,464
Right.

42
00:04:33,964 --> 00:04:35,763

44
00:04:39,164 --> 00:04:40,904
You can't get to my place without a car.

45
00:04:40,904 --> 00:04:41,904
A car?

46
00:04:43,404 --> 00:04:44,734
I'll grab a taxi.

47
00:04:48,943 --> 00:04:50,214
Do you believe that?

48
00:04:50,914 --> 00:04:51,943
What?

49
00:04:52,414 --> 00:04:54,084
That I live in Pyeongchang-dong.

50
00:04:56,253 --> 00:04:57,553
That's a rich town.

51
00:04:58,253 --> 00:04:59,784
It suits you, Hyun Chae.

52
00:05:07,923 --> 00:05:09,563
To be honest, I have nowhere to go.

53
00:05:10,734 --> 00:05:11,794
No.

54
00:05:15,704 --> 00:05:17,034
I don't want to go home.

55
00:05:29,883 --> 00:05:30,883
Then...

56
00:05:32,354 --> 00:05:33,623
do you want to come to my place?

57
00:05:37,454 --> 00:05:39,664
Man, I told them to clean up before they leave.

58
00:05:42,263 --> 00:05:43,834
We just moved in.

59
00:05:51,334 --> 00:05:52,844
- This place is a mess. - Gosh.

60
00:06:00,313 --> 00:06:02,683
What's this? Oh, a book I've been reading.

61
00:06:04,313 --> 00:06:06,883
I'm really tired right now, so...

62
00:06:09,193 --> 00:06:10,594
I'll use the bed.

63
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:15,193
Sure. Suit yourself.

66
00:07:04,943 --> 00:07:06,044
Do you have any coffee?

67
00:07:06,284 --> 00:07:07,383
I'll buy some.

68
00:07:15,654 --> 00:07:16,823
Coffee.

69
00:07:17,993 --> 00:07:20,224
Would she prefer latte? Americano?

70
00:07:20,794 --> 00:07:22,534
She looks like the espresso type.

71
00:07:28,774 --> 00:07:32,073
I didn't know what you preferred, so I was going to buy everything.

72
00:07:45,724 --> 00:07:47,954
Sorry. I didn't have any spare clothes.

73
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,684
Your death has been pushed back one day.

74
00:08:49,684 --> 00:08:51,854

No.

I thought you were at least honest with me,

129

so I trusted you as well.

130
00:13:51,314 --> 00:13:52,383
You trusted me?

150

I renewed it.

151
00:14:58,513 --> 00:15:00,084
They had deliberately changed the date of issue,

152
00:15:00,084 --> 00:15:01,684

188

Mr. Kim.

189
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,343
I'm glad you're off the hook.

190
00:17:40,114 --> 00:17:42,614
I know it wasn't easy being questioned for so long.

191
00:17:47,924 --> 00:17:50,793
Even though your work can be considered as a mistake,

192
00:17:52,023 --> 00:17:53,364
what you said back in there...

193
00:17:54,694 --> 00:17:56,434
points to you playing the blame game.

194
00:17:58,964 --> 00:18:00,103
I'm sorry.

195
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:04,704
My mind started to paint scenarios ever since the prosecution took you.

196
00:18:06,444 --> 00:18:08,243
That was thoughtless of me.

197
00:18:08,243 --> 00:18:10,073
Just like you wanted,

198
00:18:10,573 --> 00:18:13,914
I'm going to thoroughly check who is responsible.

199
00:18:32,493 --> 00:18:33,533
Hello?

200
00:18:34,603 --> 00:18:37,204
What happened to Han Ae Ri's case?

201
00:18:38,374 --> 00:18:41,043
Han... What? What case?

202
00:18:41,073 --> 00:18:43,573
The Yeoksam-dong studio apartment murder case.

203
00:18:44,714 --> 00:18:46,083
Did such a murder occur?

204
00:18:47,513 --> 00:18:49,114
Where did you hear that?

205
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,783
Are you saying that no one was killed...

206
00:18:52,414 --> 00:18:54,753
at a studio apartment in Yeoksam-dong?

207
00:18:55,654 --> 00:18:58,823
That's within our jurisdiction, but it doesn't ring a bell.

208
00:19:02,763 --> 00:19:04,793
I guess I got it mixed up.

209
00:19:12,573 --> 00:19:14,073
If it weren't for Ms. Han...

210
00:19:25,783 --> 00:19:28,823
Why was I almost murdered again?

211
00:19:30,323 --> 00:19:33,323
I managed to escape that fate twice thanks to you,

212
00:19:35,323 --> 00:19:38,164
but no one can guarantee that it won't happen again.

213
00:19:40,864 --> 00:19:42,874
I'm frustrated and scared...

214
00:19:43,204 --> 00:19:45,974
how I don't even know why someone wants me dead.

215
00:21:07,783 --> 00:21:08,783
Hello.

216
00:21:10,523 --> 00:21:11,624
Good morning, Mr. Kim.

217
00:21:11,624 --> 00:21:13,194
I want to see Manager Seo in my office.

218
00:21:13,763 --> 00:21:16,934
He's working outside the office at the moment.

219
00:21:45,993 --> 00:21:47,964
- Move. - You're to head home, sir.

220
00:21:48,593 --> 00:21:49,664
What?

221
00:21:51,134 --> 00:21:52,464
What did you just say to me?

222
00:21:53,734 --> 00:21:55,263
I'll escort you home.

223
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,204
It's best if you head home...

224
00:22:05,243 --> 00:22:07,543
(Chairman)

225
00:22:08,343 --> 00:22:10,414
Yes, Mr. Yu. This is Kim Seo Jin.

226
00:22:11,214 --> 00:22:12,984
Come see me at my office.

227
00:22:13,424 --> 00:22:14,454
Yes, sir.

228
00:22:24,164 --> 00:22:26,563
I ordered him to take you home.

229
00:22:29,204 --> 00:22:31,273
The questioning was wrapped up without any hitches.

230
00:22:32,874 --> 00:22:35,374
The chief prosecutor is a hometown friend,

231
00:22:36,043 --> 00:22:37,843
so I already heard the news.

232
00:22:38,243 --> 00:22:40,513
Still, you should lay low for the time being.

233
00:22:41,114 --> 00:22:43,753
It's actually for your own sake.

234
00:22:44,813 --> 00:22:46,684
Contrary to popular belief,

235
00:22:46,684 --> 00:22:48,124
people don't care about others' lives.

236
00:22:48,124 --> 00:22:49,253
It won't have to be for long.

237
00:22:50,194 --> 00:22:52,253
Come back to the office once people lose interest.

238
00:22:52,253 --> 00:22:53,823
The press will soon report my innocence.

239
00:22:53,823 --> 00:22:56,664
If that's not enough, I'll sue Kim Jin Ho for defamation.

240
00:22:56,664 --> 00:22:58,194
You're not hearing me.

241
00:22:58,894 --> 00:23:01,434
Being mentioned at all right now will hurt you,

242
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:03,033
so let time be on your side.

243
00:23:03,033 --> 00:23:04,273
I'm going to do whatever I can...

244
00:23:05,573 --> 00:23:07,474
to put things back to normal.

245
00:23:08,174 --> 00:23:10,414
I hear you, all right?

246
00:23:10,714 --> 00:23:13,583
Still, Manager Seo can take over for you.

247
00:23:13,743 --> 00:23:15,444
He's your most trusted man, isn't he?

248
00:23:17,984 --> 00:23:20,654
Take a break when the opportunity allows it.

249
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:32,293
I'll escort you home, sir.

250
00:24:09,063 --> 00:24:10,404
Did you grab a few drinks last night?

251
00:24:13,773 --> 00:24:15,204
Don't tell me you got into a fight.

252
00:24:16,974 --> 00:24:18,073
I didn't, sir.

253
00:24:19,114 --> 00:24:20,914
You're my personal assistant,

254
00:24:21,484 --> 00:24:22,644
not some hormonal teenager.

255
00:24:23,553 --> 00:24:25,654
If you're going to drink, be a gentleman about it.

256
00:24:26,684 --> 00:24:29,023
Yes, sir. It won't happen again.

257
00:24:30,323 --> 00:24:33,664
A man I couldn't identify was at his house last night.

258
00:24:33,664 --> 00:24:35,464
I threw something at him while running away,

259
00:24:35,464 --> 00:24:37,263
and it scratched his face a little.

260
00:24:42,464 --> 00:24:44,704
- Has the scar fully healed? - Sorry?

261
00:24:45,704 --> 00:24:48,073
Oh, that. Yes, sir.

262
00:24:48,073 --> 00:24:49,404
When did it happen again?

263
00:24:50,043 --> 00:24:51,414
Was it a month ago?

264
00:24:53,644 --> 00:24:55,914
I've been carrying myself better ever since that day.

265
00:24:57,654 --> 00:25:00,353
I apologize for troubling you, sir.

266
00:25:17,374 --> 00:25:19,503
Please call me whenever you need a driver.

267
00:25:19,503 --> 00:25:20,603
Thanks.

268
00:26:35,583 --> 00:26:36,853
Mr. Kim.

269
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:39,553
If... And this is a big if.

270
00:26:40,454 --> 00:26:43,523
What if my mom is a part of the reason I almost got killed?

271
00:26:43,523 --> 00:26:44,624
(What if my mom is a part of the reason I almost got killed?)

272
00:26:44,654 --> 00:26:46,293
Then I can't just sit like this.

273
00:26:47,023 --> 00:26:48,293
I need...

274
00:26:49,124 --> 00:26:50,734
to know the reason.

275
00:26:51,864 --> 00:26:54,063
Instead of worrying about something that hasn't happened,

276
00:26:55,003 --> 00:26:56,474
I'd rather face it.

277
00:26:59,533 --> 00:27:02,944
Ji Ah, do you want to get changed into new clothes?

278
00:27:05,513 --> 00:27:06,614
No?

279
00:27:07,013 --> 00:27:08,684
Why not?

280
00:27:09,743 --> 00:27:12,484
Okay, then. Let's get changed tomorrow.

281
00:27:14,523 --> 00:27:16,993

282

Mr. Kim.

283
00:27:32,103 --> 00:27:33,273
You know my mother, don't you?

284
00:27:34,144 --> 00:27:35,273
Her name is Kwak Song Ja.

285
00:27:36,843 --> 00:27:38,644
Why did you come to my mother's hospital room?

286
00:27:41,343 --> 00:27:44,414
My mom disappeared right after you came to see her.

287
00:27:45,214 --> 00:27:47,124
What did you say to her?

288
00:27:50,154 --> 00:27:52,753
Please tell me. This is very important to me.

289
00:27:59,134 --> 00:28:01,063
The man who was with you on that day...

290
00:28:02,303 --> 00:28:04,374
followed me and tried to kill me.

291
00:28:05,404 --> 00:28:07,404
I kept thinking about it, but I have no idea why.

292
00:28:07,474 --> 00:28:09,474
I just went there to help you...

293
00:28:09,474 --> 00:28:11,114
How can you help me anyway?

294
00:28:12,714 --> 00:28:16,513
Will you turn back the time and bring back my dead kid?

295
00:28:17,853 --> 00:28:20,583
Or can you help my dying daughter get better?

296
00:28:21,484 --> 00:28:24,293
Don't do anything, okay?

297
00:28:24,293 --> 00:28:27,763
Da Bin is also someone's precious daughter, just like Ji Ah.

298
00:28:28,224 --> 00:28:31,263

Don't put desperate fathers like Mr. Han and me...

303
00:28:42,043 --> 00:28:43,874
in the same category as Kim Seo Jin.

00:35:05,238 --> 00:35:06,437
should meet.

364
00:35:07,108 --> 00:35:10,808
I believe I can start afresh with my wife and my daughter.

365
00:36:04,198 --> 00:36:05,297
Is anyone in?

366
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:07,468
How may I help you?

367
00:36:08,827 --> 00:36:11,838
Does unit 609 have a registered vehicle?

368
00:36:11,937 --> 00:36:14,437
What is this about? Are you the resident?

369
00:36:15,868 --> 00:36:17,138
No.

370
00:36:17,978 --> 00:36:20,808
Actually, I had gotten into a car accident a few days ago.

371
00:36:21,478 --> 00:36:24,218
The owner of the other car lived in unit 609.

372
00:36:25,317 --> 00:36:26,347
And?

373
00:36:26,948 --> 00:36:30,558
But I lost their number.

374
00:36:30,657 --> 00:36:32,257
Could you tell me?

375
00:36:33,528 --> 00:36:34,727
Didn't you guys call the insurance company?

376
00:36:36,328 --> 00:36:38,528
- Show me your ID card, please. - Sure.

377
00:36:40,368 --> 00:36:42,328
The crash wasn't big enough to call the insurance company.

378
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:44,937
Here.

379
00:36:49,067 --> 00:36:50,178
Yes.

380
00:36:52,178 --> 00:36:53,347
One minute.

381
00:36:58,947 --> 00:37:02,917
Unit 609 does have a registered vehicle, right?

382
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:04,917
Registered vehicle...

383
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:07,127
Here it is.

384
00:37:07,828 --> 00:37:09,088
Do you just need the number?

385
00:37:09,127 --> 00:37:10,298
Yes, hold on.

386
00:37:11,328 --> 00:37:12,898
- Okay. - 010.

387
00:37:13,597 --> 00:37:15,328
- 010. - 0412.

388
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:16,998
0412.

389
00:37:17,037 --> 00:37:18,298
1207.

390
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:21,468
Is that all?

391
00:37:22,268 --> 00:37:25,637
(General Manager Lee Taek Gyu)

392
00:37:41,627 --> 00:37:44,097
Is he the one who was chasing us that night?

393
00:37:45,558 --> 00:37:47,798
I recorded this yesterday in front of Kim Jin Ho's place.

394
00:37:48,468 --> 00:37:50,498
I couldn't see his face clearly that night...

395
00:37:50,498 --> 00:37:51,998
because it was dark and I was running.

396
00:37:59,847 --> 00:38:02,947
It's him. Do you know who he is?

397
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:05,817
I only got his license plate number and this video.

398
00:38:06,488 --> 00:38:08,988
Darn it. I should've chased after him.

399
00:38:09,958 --> 00:38:11,357
Send that to me right now.

400
00:38:12,988 --> 00:38:15,857
(Geon Wook)

401
00:38:15,857 --> 00:38:16,958
And the license plate number?

402
00:38:20,968 --> 00:38:22,067
Hurry.

403
00:38:25,798 --> 00:38:26,808
Whom are you sending it to?

404
00:38:28,968 --> 00:38:31,678
That fraud who said you'd die?

405
00:38:31,778 --> 00:38:33,048
- He's not a fraud. - He's from Yujung Constructions,

406
00:38:33,048 --> 00:38:34,048
isn't he?

407
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,458
I knew something was odd when I had gotten you that ID card.

408
00:38:45,917 --> 00:38:47,028
What's his name?

409
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:52,797
I should know the entire picture if I want to help.

410
00:38:54,698 --> 00:38:55,797
Director Kim Seo Jin.

411
00:38:57,097 --> 00:38:58,568
His daughter was kidnapped.

412
00:38:59,907 --> 00:39:01,008
Kidnapped?

413
00:39:01,367 --> 00:39:03,307
When? Was it on the news?

414
00:39:04,177 --> 00:39:05,578
No. I mean...

415
00:39:06,607 --> 00:39:08,247
She'll be kidnapped soon.

416
00:39:08,508 --> 00:39:10,078
That's why I agreed to help him.

417
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:12,318
How exactly?

418
00:39:15,218 --> 00:39:16,718
I'll tell you next time.

419
00:39:17,917 --> 00:39:19,487
Gosh, this is...

420
00:39:22,287 --> 00:39:24,528
Does Soo Jung know this?

421
00:39:25,297 --> 00:39:27,367
I don't want to burden her.

422
00:39:28,128 --> 00:39:29,698
You're the only person I've told.

423
00:39:34,508 --> 00:39:36,677
How old is his daughter? Are they being threatened?

424
00:39:37,078 --> 00:39:40,177
Something like that. She's six.

425
00:39:40,477 --> 00:39:42,477
Then he should attach a tracker on her...

426
00:39:42,477 --> 00:39:43,518
and download the lost child prevention app.

427
00:39:43,818 --> 00:39:45,378
That way, he'll be able to find her even if she gets kidnapped.

428
00:39:45,677 --> 00:39:48,088
I'll get a tracker for you.

429
00:39:52,258 --> 00:39:54,688
I won't ask any more questions until you tell me yourself.

430
00:39:55,958 --> 00:39:57,628
So feel free to ask me for help.

431
00:39:58,227 --> 00:39:59,768
Don't keep it all bottled up.

432
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:08,867
Thank you.

433
00:40:11,938 --> 00:40:14,778
- Ae Ri. - You were on the phone all day.

434
00:40:14,847 --> 00:40:16,208
Bring your own chair.

435
00:40:18,148 --> 00:40:19,417
Ae Ri, about that from earlier...

436
00:40:29,758 --> 00:40:31,898
I can't take it any longer.

437
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:34,328
- Are you guys dating? - Have you gone insane?

438
00:40:34,568 --> 00:40:36,597
Up until recently, she was about to kill you for stealing her money.

439
00:40:36,597 --> 00:40:39,497
So why are you guys whispering in front of the dinner table?

440
00:40:41,568 --> 00:40:43,477
You helped us reconcile.

441
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:45,578
Me? When?

442
00:40:46,008 --> 00:40:49,008
You're so mentally strong.

443
00:40:49,107 --> 00:40:50,747
That's true. I am.

444
00:40:50,747 --> 00:40:52,917
It's all thanks to receiving my grandma's love growing up.

445
00:40:54,047 --> 00:40:55,547
- Lucky you. - Hey.

446
00:40:56,518 --> 00:40:57,588
Do you guys...

447
00:40:58,617 --> 00:41:01,057
remember everything from when you were 5 or 6?

448
00:41:01,057 --> 00:41:02,188
- Of course. - Of course.

449
00:41:02,997 --> 00:41:05,528
To be honest, I don't remember every single thing.

450
00:41:06,427 --> 00:41:08,268
But I do remember the impactful ones.

451
00:41:08,528 --> 00:41:10,638
For example, I remember my mom only buying my sister...

452
00:41:10,638 --> 00:41:11,968
a new pair of shoes.

453
00:41:12,097 --> 00:41:13,167
Stuff like that.

454
00:41:15,638 --> 00:41:16,938
If you were...

455
00:41:18,078 --> 00:41:20,547
kidnapped as a little kid...

456
00:41:20,547 --> 00:41:22,008
or something like that,

457
00:41:22,778 --> 00:41:24,518
it'll traumatize you for life, right?

458
00:41:24,718 --> 00:41:26,487
That's a terrifying thought.

459
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:28,218
What is it?

460
00:41:28,917 --> 00:41:31,657
Is there a little customer who pulls at your heartstrings?

461
00:41:31,718 --> 00:41:33,528
How did she know?

462
00:41:33,588 --> 00:41:36,528
She gives special attention to a middle-aged drunkard...

463
00:41:36,528 --> 00:41:37,927
because he's a regular at her convenience store.

464
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:41,068
He is a regular. He buys soju every day.

465
00:41:41,497 --> 00:41:42,497
Oh, my.

466
00:41:43,537 --> 00:41:45,638
Is that why you got hold of his wife's number?

467
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:48,607
What if he gets into an accident while drunk?

468
00:41:49,068 --> 00:41:51,078
He has a family too, you know?

469
00:41:51,607 --> 00:41:55,307
Whether it's my family or not, I hate seeing people get injured.

470
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:02,318
Come on.

471
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:04,787
Your mom will be fine.

472
00:42:05,758 --> 00:42:08,828
Wherever she may be, she'll think of you and stay strong.

473
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:12,497
So eat up and restore your energy. Here.

474
00:42:13,727 --> 00:42:15,198
Wider.

475
00:42:18,367 --> 00:42:19,367
This is some mean chicken.

476
00:42:19,367 --> 00:42:20,468
It is.

477
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:23,407
- You're eating so well. - I'm famished.

478
00:42:33,787 --> 00:42:37,758
(Han Ae Ri)

479
00:43:13,328 --> 00:43:14,357
What is this?

480
00:43:14,627 --> 00:43:16,897
Where and how did you record this?

481
00:43:16,897 --> 00:43:19,727
It's the man who chased after me from Kim Jin Ho's place.

482
00:43:20,027 --> 00:43:21,727
Geon Wook recorded that the following day...

483
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:22,928
after hiding in front of Kim Jin Ho's.

484
00:43:23,668 --> 00:43:25,298
He's Lee Taek Gyu, my personal assistant.

485
00:43:28,708 --> 00:43:30,308
Why was your personal assistant...

486
00:43:31,038 --> 00:43:32,578
with Kim Jin Ho?

487
00:43:32,578 --> 00:43:35,408
He also stopped by that studio apartment...

488
00:43:35,708 --> 00:43:36,918
where you could've gotten murdered.

489
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:38,448
I've put together the incidents that you've experienced...

490
00:43:38,448 --> 00:43:40,117
and the information I've discovered.

491
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:42,588
There's a link between Kim Jin Ho and him.

492
00:43:42,847 --> 00:43:44,588
And the 1st 2 murder attempts...

493
00:43:45,418 --> 00:43:47,387
were carried out by my personal assistant.

494
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:50,828
Yujung Constructions.

495
00:43:52,058 --> 00:43:53,468
What did you say?

496
00:43:53,698 --> 00:43:55,727
Did you listen to the voicemail I sent today?

497
00:43:55,727 --> 00:43:56,968
No.

498
00:43:58,367 --> 00:44:00,838
Not yet. Did something happen?

499
00:44:01,637 --> 00:44:03,708
I met with Kim Jin Ho...

500
00:44:04,338 --> 00:44:06,607
and found out how my dad died.

501
00:44:08,048 --> 00:44:11,147
A tall building collapsed in Taejung 19 years ago.

502
00:44:11,517 --> 00:44:12,877
And...

503
00:44:15,548 --> 00:44:17,588
that was how he died.

504
00:44:18,958 --> 00:44:21,127
One of the construction companies responsible for the disaster...

505
00:44:21,828 --> 00:44:23,027
was Yujung Constructions.

506
00:44:28,267 --> 00:44:30,568
Hello? Mr. Kim?

507
00:44:31,698 --> 00:44:33,607
- Are you still there? - Ms. Han,

508
00:44:34,968 --> 00:44:36,468
are you sure?

509
00:44:37,137 --> 00:44:38,607
What I know for sure now...

510
00:44:38,908 --> 00:44:41,578
is that my parents are connected to Yujung Constructions.

511
00:44:42,548 --> 00:44:43,877
My mom's disappearance...

512
00:45:14,908 --> 00:45:16,718
- Let's go. - Sure.

513
00:45:17,477 --> 00:45:19,347
You should catch up on your sleep now that the CSAT is over,

514
00:45:19,347 --> 00:45:20,688
not follow me out.

515
00:45:22,147 --> 00:45:25,617
I've been dying to see where you work, Dad.

516
00:45:26,088 --> 00:45:27,857
Not everyone can work at construction sites.

517
00:45:28,088 --> 00:45:30,027
Not being prepared lead to accidents.

518
00:45:33,058 --> 00:45:35,298
- Dad... - Again with the cheekiness.

519
00:45:35,298 --> 00:45:36,497
Keep it on. It's chilly.

520
00:45:37,198 --> 00:45:40,038
- Since it's cold... - I told you to keep it on.

521
00:45:40,208 --> 00:45:41,808
Come on, let's go.

522
00:45:41,808 --> 00:45:43,777
It's chilly, so put it on.

523
00:45:57,918 --> 00:45:59,387
Get closer.

524
00:46:00,588 --> 00:46:01,887
Come on.

525
00:46:06,698 --> 00:46:09,198
Dad, I'm going to the restroom.

526
00:46:09,198 --> 00:46:11,267
- It's inside. - Got it.

527
00:46:19,438 --> 00:46:22,777
(Restroom)

528
00:46:33,688 --> 00:46:35,357
(Yujung Constructions)

529
00:47:12,027 --> 00:47:13,767
Everybody, run!

530
00:47:13,828 --> 00:47:16,698
- Run! - Get out of here.

531
00:47:16,698 --> 00:47:18,997
- Run out of here. - Get going!

532
00:47:19,068 --> 00:47:21,908
- My gosh. - Get out of here!

533
00:47:28,678 --> 00:47:30,318
What's going on?

534
00:47:30,977 --> 00:47:32,218
The structure's collapsing.

535
00:47:42,227 --> 00:47:44,058
Seo Jin? Seo Jin!

536
00:47:54,968 --> 00:47:56,308
Seo Jin!

537
00:48:20,168 --> 00:48:21,267
Yes, Mr. Kim.

538
00:48:21,668 --> 00:48:22,798
Taek Gyu, it's me.

539
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:26,908
My car's in the shop, and I needed to go somewhere.

540
00:48:27,038 --> 00:48:28,867
Could you perhaps drive me in yours?

541
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:43,418
Mr. Kim.

542
00:48:44,987 --> 00:48:46,188
Where to, sir?

543
00:48:49,127 --> 00:48:50,658
I'm off to see Kim Jin Ho.

544
00:48:54,968 --> 00:48:56,867
I'll need an address.

545
00:48:58,298 --> 00:48:59,698
Jungdong Detention Center.

546
00:49:01,908 --> 00:49:02,938
Yes, sir.

547
00:49:31,637 --> 00:49:34,338
I requested a visit,

548
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:36,438
but I don't remember for which time slot.

549
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:38,607
I've had too much on my mind lately.

550
00:49:39,908 --> 00:49:41,408
I'll go and ask, sir.

551
00:49:41,408 --> 00:49:43,308
Right. The reception is that way.

552
00:50:04,367 --> 00:50:07,137
Sir, you can go and visit him now.

553
00:50:07,308 --> 00:50:08,808
Sure. Good work.

554
00:50:09,607 --> 00:50:11,578
I'll wait here until you're done.

555
00:50:11,578 --> 00:50:14,007
It's fine. You can get going. I have some place else to be anyway.

556
00:50:14,178 --> 00:50:15,178
Yes, sir.

557
00:50:34,168 --> 00:50:37,468
(Jungdong Detention Center)

558
00:51:06,497 --> 00:51:07,968
You still have something more to say?

559
00:51:07,968 --> 00:51:09,968
How do you know Lee Taek Gyu, my personal assistant?

560
00:51:13,908 --> 00:51:16,568
It was him who followed Ms. Han Ae Ri...

561
00:51:17,078 --> 00:51:18,237
with the intention of killing her.

562
00:51:20,747 --> 00:51:24,247
I knew it. It wasn't just your personal vendetta.

563
00:51:24,777 --> 00:51:25,848
So tell me.

564
00:51:27,148 --> 00:51:29,218
- What did you receive in return? - I don't know what you mean.

565
00:51:29,218 --> 00:51:31,188
I didn't expect you to talk so easily.

566
00:51:32,888 --> 00:51:35,487
Mr. Kim, I went by...

567
00:51:37,858 --> 00:51:40,128
the hospital your second child is at.

568
00:51:43,938 --> 00:51:45,997
You still have a reason to live.

569
00:51:46,668 --> 00:51:47,708
I...

570
00:51:49,868 --> 00:51:51,277
can't even give up the one I lost,

571
00:51:51,277 --> 00:51:53,507
so how could you abandon the one that's still alive?

572
00:51:55,608 --> 00:51:56,948
You should leave.

573
00:51:56,948 --> 00:51:59,418
I don't know what you were promised,

574
00:51:59,517 --> 00:52:00,888
but those who kidnapped and murdered my child...

575
00:52:00,888 --> 00:52:02,218
won't protect you.

576
00:52:02,587 --> 00:52:06,158
They were ruthless enough to kill a child for their goal.

577
00:52:06,487 --> 00:52:08,027
Do you seriously think they'd protect yours?

578
00:52:10,757 --> 00:52:14,428
Tell me the truth, and I'll help you.

579
00:52:17,868 --> 00:52:18,938
I promise...

580
00:52:20,807 --> 00:52:22,108
on my child's soul.

581
00:52:27,948 --> 00:52:29,208
I have nothing to say.

582
00:52:29,277 --> 00:52:31,747
I'm... I'm going back to my cell now.

583
00:52:32,218 --> 00:52:33,277
No...

584
00:52:34,087 --> 00:52:36,087
(Visiting Room 1)

585
00:53:28,837 --> 00:53:31,208
(Recipient: Kwak Song Ja)

586
00:53:36,408 --> 00:53:40,277
My gosh. Are you kidding me with this electricity bill?

587
00:53:43,487 --> 00:53:46,087
What on earth? That's all we used?

588
00:53:47,628 --> 00:53:50,757
Mom! You don't turn on the AC when I'm not home, do you?

589
00:53:50,757 --> 00:53:52,698
Why would I need to...

590
00:53:52,858 --> 00:53:55,827
when I can open the windows and let the breeze cool me down?

591
00:53:58,168 --> 00:54:01,267
Mom, please. Turn on the AC in the summer...

592
00:54:01,267 --> 00:54:03,668
and the heater in the winter.

593
00:54:03,837 --> 00:54:06,077
It'll cost us more if you get sick.

594
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:07,648
Got it?

595
00:54:08,747 --> 00:54:11,747
They keep the AC on all day at your workplace, right?

596
00:54:15,287 --> 00:54:19,487
Mom, can you make me doenjang stew...

597
00:54:19,688 --> 00:54:21,587
with pork and ugeoji?

598
00:54:21,587 --> 00:54:24,257
Sure. Let's have a lovely dinner.

599
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:39,408
Mom, where are you right now?

600
00:54:42,247 --> 00:54:44,477
I have so much to ask you.

601
00:54:55,087 --> 00:54:56,158
Mr. Park.

602
00:54:57,027 --> 00:54:58,158
Mr. Park.

603
00:54:58,398 --> 00:54:59,628
- What is it? - Have you read the article?

604
00:55:00,128 --> 00:55:02,227
- About what? - About Mr. Kim Seo Jin.

605
00:55:02,227 --> 00:55:03,997
He has been cleared of all charges.

("Rumours About Illegal Materials Turn Out to be False")

609
00:55:19,678 --> 00:55:22,188
Why are they making a fuss out of something that's obvious?

610
00:55:22,648 --> 00:55:25,618
Did Seo Jin see this? Let him know.

611
00:55:25,888 --> 00:55:26,987
Yes, sir.

612
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:30,727
Also, make a dinner appointment with him.

613
00:55:30,898 --> 00:55:31,997
Hold on.

614
00:55:32,757 --> 00:55:34,868
What's a good, rejuvenating dish?

615
00:55:35,428 --> 00:55:37,398
- I'll look for a place. - Okay.

00:56:34,987 --> 00:56:35,987
Hello?

623
00:56:44,837 --> 00:56:46,098
I'm certain that it's Han Ae Ri.

624
00:56:47,267 --> 00:56:49,368
You gave me her number and told me to look into it,

625
00:56:49,368 --> 00:56:50,537
so I did.

626
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:52,977
She was just someone preparing for the civil service test.

627
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:54,807
Is something wrong?

628
00:56:55,678 --> 00:56:58,077
She's still contacting Kim Seo Jin.

629
00:57:00,218 --> 00:57:01,587
Look into the call history.

630
00:57:02,787 --> 00:57:04,287
Yes, sir.

631
00:57:23,708 --> 00:57:25,737
Where did it go awry?

632
00:57:30,648 --> 00:57:31,747
Sir.

633
00:57:33,777 --> 00:57:35,247
Because he killed my Da Bin.

634
00:57:35,247 --> 00:57:37,958
Mr. Kim, please let me know if there's anything...

635
00:57:38,317 --> 00:57:39,688
you need.

636
00:57:42,327 --> 00:57:44,557
Thank you for today. I'll be in touch.

637
00:58:29,138 --> 00:58:31,378
The chairman said that even though you trust nobody,

638
00:58:32,337 --> 00:58:34,608
you still rely on me in a certain way.

639
00:58:36,077 --> 00:58:38,047
Is that what you think as well?

640
00:58:52,727 --> 00:58:54,898
- Han Ae Ri. - Han Ae Ri.

641
00:58:54,997 --> 00:58:56,168
Han Ae Ri.

I must be out of it these days. I keep leaving things behind.

671
01:02:14,327 --> 01:02:16,727

I can't lie to Ae Ri anymore!

Must I keep my silence?

694
01:08:10,348 --> 01:08:11,918
Yes, exactly.

695
01:08:11,918 --> 01:08:13,057
I'll kill them all.

696
01:08:13,057 --> 01:08:14,487
Why not point that anger at a specific someone?

697
01:08:14,487 --> 01:08:16,757
You must find her before September 26.

698
01:08:16,757 --> 01:08:18,128
Why the deadline?

699
01:08:18,128 --> 01:08:21,128
Mr. Kim, are you sure you didn't recognize the body?

700
01:08:21,128 --> 01:08:23,698
I'll find your mother no matter what.
