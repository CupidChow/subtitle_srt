1
00:00:41,802 --> 00:00:42,902
Is he dead?

2
00:00:44,071 --> 00:00:45,531
We should move him first.

3
00:00:45,702 --> 00:00:48,272
Why? Shouldn't we handle him right away?

4
00:00:48,302 --> 00:00:49,802
Someone could be with him.

5
00:00:52,772 --> 00:00:54,211
How annoying.

6
00:01:24,641 --> 00:01:26,441
- Good shot! - Nice.

7
00:01:26,471 --> 00:01:27,712
Your swing has gotten better.

8
00:01:28,342 --> 00:01:30,512
- I know. Good shot. - That was great.

9
00:01:34,852 --> 00:01:36,551
- Good shot. - Nice shot!

10
00:01:36,852 --> 00:01:38,051
Can you help me with my swing?

11
00:01:38,852 --> 00:01:40,551
Maybe I should change my grip.

12
00:01:40,762 --> 00:01:42,462
But I don't want to help.

13
00:01:43,191 --> 00:01:44,992
- My arms should be straighter. - Kang Hyun Chae?

14
00:01:45,861 --> 00:01:48,702
Hyun Chae, it's you. Don't you remember me?

15
00:01:49,202 --> 00:01:50,232
Who...

16
00:01:50,232 --> 00:01:52,702
I went to Sejin College of Music with you.

17
00:01:52,971 --> 00:01:55,072
It's understandable that you forgot...

18
00:01:55,072 --> 00:01:56,342
since you dropped out after freshman year.

19
00:01:58,342 --> 00:02:00,781
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you have the wrong person.

20
00:02:01,111 --> 00:02:02,641
But I'm sure it's you.

21
00:02:03,042 --> 00:02:04,411
Don't you remember me?

22
00:02:04,611 --> 00:02:07,952
I lived close by, so your dad would give me a ride to school.

23
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:10,322
It's not me.

24
00:02:15,861 --> 00:02:18,262
What was that about? Wasn't she in your class?

25
00:02:18,262 --> 00:02:19,491
But I don't know her.

26
00:02:19,491 --> 00:02:20,931
What's this about you dropping out?

27
00:02:21,431 --> 00:02:22,762
That's news to me.

28
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,102
I said I don't know her.

29
00:02:26,371 --> 00:02:28,401
Don't irritate me over something meaningless.

30
00:03:14,282 --> 00:03:15,681
At least change out of your clothes.

31
00:03:15,681 --> 00:03:16,982
Your father...

32
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:20,252
is abroad conducting business,

33
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:25,262
- right? - Yes, that's right.

34
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:28,461
Is it though?

35
00:03:30,632 --> 00:03:32,331
What is it that you want to hear?

36
00:03:32,931 --> 00:03:34,042
The truth.

37
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,512
Nothing more and nothing less.

38
00:03:37,512 --> 00:03:39,412
And what does that change?

39
00:03:44,611 --> 00:03:46,482
- What? - It wasn't all a lie.

40
00:03:47,782 --> 00:03:50,021
I did live in Pyeongchang-dong...

41
00:03:50,181 --> 00:03:51,852
and studied music in college.

42
00:03:55,091 --> 00:03:56,521
Tell me the truth, darn it!

43
00:03:57,162 --> 00:03:58,961
Don't be scared.

44
00:04:03,662 --> 00:04:06,171
Lower your voice. You'll wake Da Bin.

45
00:04:06,171 --> 00:04:09,472
Seriously? As if I can care right now.

46
00:04:14,782 --> 00:04:18,252
You're one to only ask questions you know the answer to.

47
00:04:30,262 --> 00:04:31,661
Why did you marry me?

48
00:04:32,331 --> 00:04:33,891
And don't lie about being in love.

49
00:04:33,891 --> 00:04:37,401
What about you? You liked me for my background too.

50
00:04:38,502 --> 00:04:40,531
You're constantly embarrassed by your father...

51
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:42,172
who was a construction worker,

52
00:04:42,502 --> 00:04:44,742
which is why you chose me...

53
00:04:45,211 --> 00:04:47,541
as a well-educated and rich trophy wife.

54
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,841
Don't you even think about making me sound as low as you.

55
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:51,252
So what comes next?

56
00:04:52,552 --> 00:04:53,911
Divorce?

57
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:58,422
A wife who lied. A marriage that failed.

58
00:04:59,492 --> 00:05:01,322
Could you handle being labelled that way?

59
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:09,302
So let it go.

60
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,572
You don't have the courage to divorce me anyway.

61
00:05:12,572 --> 00:05:14,502
The last thing you want is to ruin your perfect life.

62
00:05:48,341 --> 00:05:50,172
Have this if you can't stomach that.

63
00:05:56,211 --> 00:05:59,481
What about the charity event tonight?

64
00:05:59,552 --> 00:06:00,882
When should I be there?

65
00:06:07,122 --> 00:06:09,492
I'll send Taek Gyu to drive you. And Da Bin?

66
00:06:09,492 --> 00:06:10,932
I already called the babysitter.

67
00:06:48,161 --> 00:06:50,762
(Kairos)

68
00:06:55,702 --> 00:06:58,872
The phone is turned off and you'll be redirected to voicemail.

69
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,112
Please leave a message...

70
00:07:05,312 --> 00:07:08,322
The phone is turned off and you'll be redirected to...

71
00:07:09,151 --> 00:07:11,091
(This is the new ID and password.)

72
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:12,122
(Kim Seo Jin)

73
00:07:13,552 --> 00:07:16,862
- The phone is turned off. - No.

74
00:07:19,492 --> 00:07:22,731
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message after the tone.

75
00:07:23,062 --> 00:07:24,231
No.

76
00:07:40,882 --> 00:07:43,081
This won't do. Let's move him to a hospital.

77
00:07:43,151 --> 00:07:44,182
Why?

78
00:07:44,651 --> 00:07:45,851
You want to save him?

79
00:07:48,091 --> 00:07:49,492
This works for the best.

80
00:07:50,891 --> 00:07:51,961
Let's get rid of him.

81
00:07:56,161 --> 00:07:57,632
Is this necessary?

82
00:07:58,202 --> 00:08:00,302
I'll think of a way. Or...

83
00:08:01,271 --> 00:08:03,942
- he may not remember anything. - And if he does? What will you do?

84
00:08:06,572 --> 00:08:08,182
This is why we broke up.

85
00:08:15,122 --> 00:08:16,581
I hate the uncertainty.

86
00:08:17,891 --> 00:08:19,151
I refuse to live that way.

87
00:08:21,961 --> 00:08:23,422
If you can't, then I will.

88
00:08:25,992 --> 00:08:27,062
I'll do it.

89
00:08:29,862 --> 00:08:30,901
I will.

90
00:08:41,881 --> 00:08:43,412
Da Bin. Da Bin!

91
00:09:04,672 --> 00:09:06,702
Then there should be some kind of progress!

92
00:09:06,932 --> 00:09:08,272
Please calm down, sir.

93
00:09:09,942 --> 00:09:11,942
We need to see if the DNA matches.

94
00:09:11,942 --> 00:09:13,672
We don't need that.

95
00:09:15,381 --> 00:09:16,481
It's not her.

96
00:09:16,611 --> 00:09:17,782
Let me give you her DNA.

97
00:09:18,152 --> 00:09:20,611
I'm sure there are some hair strands on her clothes.

98
00:09:21,011 --> 00:09:22,081
Honey.

99
00:09:25,552 --> 00:09:27,292
If I don't do this,

100
00:09:29,721 --> 00:09:31,792
I don't think I'll be able to live.

101
00:09:33,662 --> 00:09:36,032
Because of you, I lost Da Bin.

102
00:09:49,042 --> 00:09:50,142
Are you seriously crying?

103
00:09:57,581 --> 00:09:58,751
I think I was too into my character.

104
00:10:02,162 --> 00:10:03,922
I only have two hours more...

105
00:10:07,091 --> 00:10:08,802
to live as Kang Hyun Chae.

106
00:10:21,711 --> 00:10:24,812
(September 3, Thursday)

(Kim Seo Jin)

108
00:10:34,392 --> 00:10:37,591
The phone is turned off and you'll be redirected to voicemail.

109
00:10:37,831 --> 00:10:40,261
Your call will be charged after the beep.

110
00:10:41,702 --> 00:10:44,302
Mr. Kim, what's going on?

111
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,731
Please...

112
00:10:47,501 --> 00:10:48,971
Please pick up.

113
00:10:51,711 --> 00:10:52,871
Don't tell me...

114
00:10:54,241 --> 00:10:56,111
that Lee Taek Gyu got to you.

115
00:10:57,912 --> 00:10:59,351
Please call back.

116
00:11:05,522 --> 00:11:06,692
He has your former number, right?

117
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:10,192
(Ae Ri: Unavailable)

118
00:11:11,162 --> 00:11:14,261
The caller have requested this number...

119
00:11:14,261 --> 00:11:16,932
to be temporarily out of service.

120
00:11:17,831 --> 00:11:19,072
It's out of service.

121
00:11:23,442 --> 00:11:26,711
The phone is turned off. You'll be redirected to voice mail.

122
00:11:26,711 --> 00:11:27,841
What's going on?

123
00:11:28,682 --> 00:11:31,111
It's the same number, so why is it different?

124
00:11:32,912 --> 00:11:36,282
September 7 is the day he and I first got in touch.

125
00:11:37,522 --> 00:11:39,892
That's when he started using my number.

126
00:11:40,251 --> 00:11:42,392
I can only talk to him through my phone for a minute,

127
00:11:42,792 --> 00:11:44,591
starting from 10:33pm.

128
00:11:45,892 --> 00:11:46,991
That's enough.

129
00:11:47,662 --> 00:11:49,402
I'm a fool for trusting you.

130
00:11:49,601 --> 00:11:51,672
- Just forget about it. - I can't.

131
00:11:52,402 --> 00:11:54,272
The last time we spoke,

132
00:11:54,272 --> 00:11:56,942
he said he could connect to the tracker in Da Bin's toy.

133
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:00,711
Let me see it.

134
00:12:02,782 --> 00:12:05,312
(Kim Seo Jin)

135
00:12:05,312 --> 00:12:06,611
What are you doing?

136
00:12:07,981 --> 00:12:09,981
We need to know where things started to go awry.

137
00:12:11,251 --> 00:12:15,461
Ae Ri, send me all the texts you two sent to each other.

138
00:12:18,562 --> 00:12:20,731
If something really happened to him...

139
00:12:21,361 --> 00:12:25,072
That's all the more reason why we should protect Da Bin.

140
00:12:27,072 --> 00:12:28,841
That way, we can fix everything.

141
00:13:31,501 --> 00:13:34,131
I know it's tough, but please hang in there.

142
00:13:34,702 --> 00:13:38,971
Once everything is over, Our families should meet.

143
00:13:39,812 --> 00:13:43,412
I believe I can start afresh with my wife and my daughter.

144
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:45,812
It's all thanks to you.

No, not yet. I'll let you know when she does.

Thanks. You're a reliable friend.

168

Then you need to stay quiet.

184
00:18:03,672 --> 00:18:05,672
You scared everyone. Look what you've done.

185
00:18:10,011 --> 00:18:11,112
Take care of her.

186
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:13,781
I'm on my way.

187
00:18:18,592 --> 00:18:20,422
It's okay.

188
00:18:25,561 --> 00:18:26,761
Would you like something to eat?

189
00:18:35,741 --> 00:18:36,942
Da Bin.

190
00:18:37,142 --> 00:18:39,342
- Goodness. - Come here.

191
00:18:41,642 --> 00:18:42,781
Did your dad scold you?

192
00:18:43,942 --> 00:18:46,511
You won't be able to eat properly later,

193
00:18:46,682 --> 00:18:48,452
so you should grab a bite to eat right now.

194
00:18:48,582 --> 00:18:50,122
I'll watch Da Bin for you.

195
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,021
- Could I ask for this favour? - Sure.

196
00:18:54,152 --> 00:18:55,321
Da Bin, I'll see you later.

197
00:18:59,162 --> 00:19:01,602
Da Bin, why don't we have some fun later?

198
00:19:02,301 --> 00:19:04,702
I saw a huge stuffed animal over there.

199
00:19:05,402 --> 00:19:07,202
Where is it?

200
00:19:07,202 --> 00:19:09,202
Would you like to see it? Come on.

201
00:19:09,202 --> 00:19:10,402
Let's wipe these tears.

202
00:19:10,501 --> 00:19:11,741
Come on.

203
00:19:12,912 --> 00:19:14,041
Let's go.

204
00:21:18,202 --> 00:21:19,202
(I'm here.)

205
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:39,922
He's here!

206
00:21:40,491 --> 00:21:41,922
Kim Jin Ho is entering the building.

207
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:45,061
We're to serve shortly.

208
00:21:45,061 --> 00:21:46,061
- Yes, chef! - Yes, chef!

209
00:22:54,892 --> 00:22:58,061
(Stairs)

210
00:23:10,112 --> 00:23:11,241
Ms. Han?

211
00:23:16,852 --> 00:23:18,221
Why are you here?

212
00:23:22,491 --> 00:23:23,892
What are you doing here?

213
00:23:27,592 --> 00:23:28,862
It's Section 5-B.

214
00:24:17,241 --> 00:24:19,352
Kim Jin Ho is in Section A on the third floor.

215
00:24:22,051 --> 00:24:23,082
Ae Ri?

216
00:24:24,622 --> 00:24:25,751
Ae Ri!

217
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,521
Are you listening?

218
00:24:57,082 --> 00:24:58,422
Han Ae Ri is here.

219
00:26:00,882 --> 00:26:01,952
Da Bin!

220
00:26:44,922 --> 00:26:47,332
Da Bin, it's all right.

221
00:26:49,632 --> 00:26:52,231
You're under arrest for the attempted kidnapping of a minor.

222
00:26:52,231 --> 00:26:53,301
Let go of me.

223
00:26:53,702 --> 00:26:55,442
- You have the right to an attorney. - Let go.

224
00:26:55,471 --> 00:26:58,501
It's not me. He's the one you want!

225
00:26:58,602 --> 00:27:00,571
It's not me. It's him.

226
00:27:00,842 --> 00:27:02,182
You must catch him!

227
00:27:02,811 --> 00:27:04,211
It's not me!

228
00:27:05,342 --> 00:27:07,311
No. Don't come.

229
00:27:52,061 --> 00:27:53,261
Mom.

230
00:27:56,702 --> 00:27:58,432
- Da Bin! - Mom.

231
00:27:58,432 --> 00:27:59,872
Are you okay?

232
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:02,372
- Yes. - I almost got a heart attack.

233
00:28:03,501 --> 00:28:04,642
Let me see you.

234
00:28:06,241 --> 00:28:07,642
- Are you not hurt? - No.

235
00:28:20,652 --> 00:28:23,162
I'm sorry, but please step back. You can't take any photos.

236
00:28:23,461 --> 00:28:24,491
Don't take any photos.

237
00:28:27,261 --> 00:28:28,261
I shouldn't have helped...

238
00:28:35,872 --> 00:28:37,342
Something's wrong.

239
00:28:37,771 --> 00:28:39,241
I'm not a kidnapper!

240
00:28:39,241 --> 00:28:40,412
Then...

241
00:28:45,852 --> 00:28:46,912
Explain this.

242
00:28:47,051 --> 00:28:49,021
(Missing Child)

243
00:28:50,751 --> 00:28:54,652
(Missing Child)

244
00:29:00,461 --> 00:29:06,571
(Missing Child)

245
00:29:06,571 --> 00:29:08,501
(Missing Child)

246
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:19,952
I'm certain it was her.

247
00:29:20,852 --> 00:29:21,852
Get her in the car.

248
00:29:24,182 --> 00:29:25,281
Ae Ri!

249
00:29:26,251 --> 00:29:28,192
We need to stay back and come up with a plan.

250
00:29:36,461 --> 00:29:38,132
It really isn't me.

251
00:29:38,702 --> 00:29:40,731
I wasn't trying to kidnap her.

252
00:29:40,932 --> 00:29:42,741
Rather, I was trying to protect her from the kidnapper.

253
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:44,971
This is you, right?

254
00:29:48,981 --> 00:29:51,741
Yes, it is.

255
00:29:52,711 --> 00:29:55,251
I left it there to prevent Da Bin from getting kidnapped.

256
00:29:55,622 --> 00:29:57,481
Do you think that even makes sense?

257
00:29:58,122 --> 00:30:00,652
What kind of lunatic posts flyers about things...

258
00:30:00,652 --> 00:30:02,251
that haven't even occurred yet?

259
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:07,031
I know you made that flyer to scare Mr. Kim.

260
00:30:07,892 --> 00:30:10,031
I heard you visited his workplace and his residence as well.

261
00:30:10,162 --> 00:30:12,261
Didn't you go through with this because the threats didn't work?

262
00:30:13,402 --> 00:30:14,531
What threats?

263
00:30:15,102 --> 00:30:16,741
Ask him again.

264
00:30:17,172 --> 00:30:19,672
Ask him exactly what I had told him when I had visited...

265
00:30:19,672 --> 00:30:21,471
his workplace and his home.

266
00:30:21,942 --> 00:30:24,182
I've never demanded money from him.

267
00:30:24,582 --> 00:30:26,952
I only asked him to keep Da Bin safe.

268
00:30:27,682 --> 00:30:31,221
Look. Think in my shoes for once.

269
00:30:31,321 --> 00:30:33,652
Can't you see that you're just talking nonsense?

270
00:30:36,061 --> 00:30:38,521
Did you ride a time machine or something?

271
00:30:38,862 --> 00:30:40,892
Are you saying you tried to stop something in the future?

272
00:30:44,731 --> 00:30:46,071
Give me my phone.

273
00:30:46,571 --> 00:30:48,832
If you look at the messages he and I sent to each other,

274
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,642
you'll know right away that I'm innocent.

275
00:30:50,741 --> 00:30:51,971
Where's my phone?

276
00:30:54,442 --> 00:30:55,442
Did you find anything?

277
00:30:55,781 --> 00:30:58,241
These are the texts. It's very strange.

278
00:30:59,412 --> 00:31:00,412
What is?

279
00:31:00,412 --> 00:31:02,721
She did indeed send texts to him.

280
00:31:03,082 --> 00:31:05,152
It is his number.

281
00:31:05,622 --> 00:31:09,561
But the problem is, he got that number yesterday.

282
00:31:10,521 --> 00:31:11,592
What do you mean?

283
00:31:12,321 --> 00:31:13,632
Did you check with the phone company?

284
00:31:13,692 --> 00:31:17,602
His current number is only a day old.

285
00:31:17,761 --> 00:31:20,832
That's why he doesn't have any texts from her on his phone.

286
00:31:20,902 --> 00:31:23,241
And I found out that she was the one...

287
00:31:23,241 --> 00:31:25,471
who had used the same number a month ago.

288
00:31:26,142 --> 00:31:27,672
- It was her? - Yes.

289
00:31:29,011 --> 00:31:31,481
What then? Did she plot everything?

290
00:31:31,642 --> 00:31:33,751
There are individuals online who create different IDs...

291
00:31:33,751 --> 00:31:35,511
and reply to their own comments.

292
00:31:36,051 --> 00:31:38,582
I think she is mentally unstable.

293
00:31:55,017 --> 00:31:57,057
Mom, I can't sleep.

294
00:31:57,256 --> 00:31:58,996
You can't?

295
00:31:59,727 --> 00:32:02,467
I'm here, okay? You can go to sleep.

296
00:32:06,767 --> 00:32:07,866
Go to sleep.

297
00:32:08,497 --> 00:32:09,866
There you go.

298
00:32:42,967 --> 00:32:44,406
How could you?

299
00:32:44,537 --> 00:32:47,037
How could you not tell me and let it get this far?

300
00:32:47,336 --> 00:32:49,577
About what? What went too far?

301
00:32:49,677 --> 00:32:51,077
We cut it close today.

302
00:32:51,147 --> 00:32:53,977
You should've told me about getting the cops involved.

303
00:32:54,046 --> 00:32:56,686
Nothing serious happened and it all ended well.

304
00:32:56,887 --> 00:33:00,557
Would you have been able to perform well if I had told you?

305
00:33:02,686 --> 00:33:03,986
Getting on your boss' good side...

306
00:33:04,557 --> 00:33:06,997
means more to you than Da Bin's safety.

307
00:33:07,656 --> 00:33:09,066
Don't be dramatic.

308
00:33:10,027 --> 00:33:12,637
You were worried too after that crazy girl came over.

309
00:33:14,296 --> 00:33:16,406
Did she come by again in my absence?

310
00:33:17,536 --> 00:33:19,876
Are you insane? Why would I even meet her?

311
00:33:21,376 --> 00:33:24,176
I just thought she was some lunatic.

312
00:33:24,176 --> 00:33:27,546
Exactly. Did you think I couldn't handle one?

313
00:33:28,176 --> 00:33:29,917
I was only going to call the police...

314
00:33:30,046 --> 00:33:32,257
and have a retraining order taken out,

315
00:33:32,786 --> 00:33:34,486
but I didn't know what she'd do.

316
00:33:34,717 --> 00:33:36,986
It seemed better to catch her red-handed.

317
00:33:37,626 --> 00:33:39,497
Why leave room for uncertainty?

318
00:33:40,156 --> 00:33:41,857
It's better to be in control of the situation.

319
00:33:44,997 --> 00:33:46,036
Hello?

320
00:33:48,396 --> 00:33:49,467
Sure thing.

321
00:34:06,157 --> 00:34:07,456
(Hyun Chae)

322
00:34:12,157 --> 00:34:13,697
We'll talk in person tomorrow.

323
00:34:24,736 --> 00:34:25,937
What about Kim Jin Ho?

324
00:34:27,306 --> 00:34:30,077
He got in range but ran off after seeing what happened.

325
00:34:32,007 --> 00:34:34,847
Do Kyun, what will you about him?

326
00:34:36,486 --> 00:34:38,787
- What do you mean? - Can you leave him be?

327
00:34:39,687 --> 00:34:41,317
He's aware of our plan.

328
00:34:42,556 --> 00:34:44,426
What if he tells Kim Seo Jin?

329
00:34:50,327 --> 00:34:51,597
I'll deal with him.

330
00:34:53,067 --> 00:34:54,167
You'll deal with him?

331
00:34:55,466 --> 00:34:56,567
How?

332
00:34:57,236 --> 00:34:58,366
You'll kill him?

333
00:34:59,607 --> 00:35:01,037
Don't be ridiculous.

334
00:35:01,037 --> 00:35:03,276
He took the job hungry for money. He must go.

335
00:35:03,276 --> 00:35:04,377
Just wait.

336
00:35:05,246 --> 00:35:07,646
- It's not over yet. - Is there a Plan B?

337
00:35:11,046 --> 00:35:12,787
We need to figure out something first.

338
00:35:13,086 --> 00:35:14,586
Han Ae Ri.

339
00:35:15,727 --> 00:35:18,387
How could she have been there at that exact time?

340
00:35:19,597 --> 00:35:22,127
It's as if she knew what we had planned.

341
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:26,437
You saw her at Kim Jin Ho's house and at the studio apartment, right?

342
00:35:26,437 --> 00:35:28,437
It's obvious that she was there to meet Kim Jin Ho.

343
00:35:29,266 --> 00:35:30,537
But the studio apartment...

344
00:35:32,806 --> 00:35:33,937
Going down.

345
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:44,441
1-4 Hangil-ro, please.

346
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,582
I only saw her on the street, not in the building.

347
00:35:52,582 --> 00:35:55,791
She didn't demand money when she came to see me at the office.

348
00:35:55,791 --> 00:35:57,391
Da Bin will be kidnapped...

349
00:35:57,791 --> 00:35:58,891
by Kim Jin Ho.

350
00:35:59,191 --> 00:36:02,261
That's exactly why you should meet with him to prevent that.

351
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:04,932
What's her angle?

352
00:36:06,131 --> 00:36:07,761
- What is the police saying? - They're leaning toward...

353
00:36:07,761 --> 00:36:08,872
a mental disorder.

354
00:36:09,002 --> 00:36:11,472
- Are you sure? - I heard from a detective...

355
00:36:11,631 --> 00:36:12,742
who was at the scene of the arrest.

356
00:36:14,141 --> 00:36:17,612
(Kangil Police Station, Lee Tae Woo)

357
00:36:17,841 --> 00:36:20,042
Some crazy woman just happened to guess...

358
00:36:20,982 --> 00:36:22,211
an organized kidnapping?

359
00:36:24,511 --> 00:36:26,951
I need to know what she knows.

360
00:36:53,612 --> 00:36:54,742
I...

361
00:36:55,651 --> 00:36:57,211
When can I go home?

362
00:36:57,412 --> 00:37:00,081
You were arrested at the scene, so dream on.

363
00:37:00,982 --> 00:37:03,052
- What? - You'll stay here...

364
00:37:03,052 --> 00:37:05,891
and be transferred to a facility once the warrant is issued.

365
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:09,261
- I'll be locked up? - The warrant might not be issued.

366
00:37:09,531 --> 00:37:12,401
If that's the case, you'll wait for trial at home.

367
00:37:14,062 --> 00:37:15,131
This is where you'll sleep tonight.

368
00:37:17,531 --> 00:37:21,441
Can I at least get a phone call?

369
00:37:22,441 --> 00:37:23,612
On my phone, please.

370
00:37:23,711 --> 00:37:25,641
- Use our land line. - No!

371
00:37:26,581 --> 00:37:28,281
It has to be my phone.

372
00:37:28,511 --> 00:37:31,211
Your phone is with the forensics at the moment.

373
00:37:31,812 --> 00:37:34,281
Either use the land line or forget about it.

374
00:37:53,802 --> 00:37:55,271
This is why I told you two to back off.

375
00:37:57,341 --> 00:37:58,912
I should've objected more vigorously.

376
00:37:59,011 --> 00:38:00,112
Hold on a second.

377
00:38:05,752 --> 00:38:09,352
(Ae Ri, Disconnected)

00:38:11,191 --> 00:38:12,591
The caller have requested this number...

379
00:38:12,591 --> 00:38:14,292
to be temporarily out of service.

380
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,932
Darn it!

381
00:38:16,862 --> 00:38:19,362
Answer the phone, you jerk!

382
00:38:19,562 --> 00:38:21,401
What on earth are you even doing?

383
00:38:21,602 --> 00:38:23,102
Do you really believe...

384
00:38:23,771 --> 00:38:27,002
that a person living a month ahead of us will answer?

385
00:38:27,201 --> 00:38:28,941
Does that make sense to you?

386
00:38:32,742 --> 00:38:35,752
What's gotten into you both?

(Kangil Police Station)

388
00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:38,372
Mr. Kim,

389
00:39:40,412 --> 00:39:41,742
I need you to remember.

390
00:39:41,982 --> 00:39:43,112
Remember what?

391
00:39:44,511 --> 00:39:45,752
Don't you remember?

392
00:39:47,222 --> 00:39:49,951
The missing child posters were put up by you.

393
00:39:50,122 --> 00:39:51,222
Me?

394
00:39:52,461 --> 00:39:54,591
You said that only I could save your child and wife.

395
00:39:54,761 --> 00:39:57,432
I didn't believe you at first, but you persuaded me.

396
00:39:57,961 --> 00:39:59,802
You proved that you lived a month ahead of me...

397
00:39:59,802 --> 00:40:01,662
by giving me lottery numbers.

398
00:40:01,662 --> 00:40:04,672
Come on. You're spewing nonsense.

399
00:40:06,701 --> 00:40:08,372
So what did you get out of this?

400
00:40:09,341 --> 00:40:10,771
What did you want in return?

401
00:40:11,372 --> 00:40:12,711
Why did you make me your target?

402
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,252
You promised to find my mom.

403
00:40:16,711 --> 00:40:19,321
You're the one who asked for my help first!

404
00:40:22,222 --> 00:40:23,722
What about my mom now?

405
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:26,222
What will happen to her?

406
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:29,692
What about my mom?

407
00:40:35,702 --> 00:40:37,732
These are the text messages...

408
00:40:37,732 --> 00:40:39,502
that she exchanged with you on her phone.

00:40:41,942 --> 00:40:43,742
By the way, I've seen this Da Bin girl.

411
00:40:43,742 --> 00:40:45,212
Please give me a call. Please hear out my story.

412
00:40:45,212 --> 00:40:46,511
These are the winning numbers for the week's lottery.

413
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:49,352
If you're really from the future, please help me.

414
00:40:51,112 --> 00:40:53,021
Does my phone have the same texts?

415
00:40:53,151 --> 00:40:55,222
No, they weren't on any of the servers either.

416
00:40:57,791 --> 00:41:01,561
She's clearly bold and organized. Diminished capacity, my foot.

417
00:41:05,291 --> 00:41:06,661
Do you know how much people like you...

418
00:41:07,732 --> 00:41:09,171
disgust me?

419
00:41:10,671 --> 00:41:12,702
You try to obtain everything easily,

420
00:41:12,872 --> 00:41:14,641
but give up when things don't pan out.

421
00:41:15,002 --> 00:41:16,911
You avoid taking responsibility...

422
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:20,041
and cause trouble to everyone around you.

423
00:41:21,112 --> 00:41:22,181
I know the kind too well.

424
00:41:23,612 --> 00:41:27,051
After planning the unthinkable, you're claiming to be crazy?

425
00:41:27,582 --> 00:41:30,021
That sort of juvenile behaviour might've worked in the past,

426
00:41:30,592 --> 00:41:31,692
but...

427
00:41:32,661 --> 00:41:33,822
not this time.

428
00:41:36,631 --> 00:41:37,962
I want her to properly pay.

429
00:41:41,602 --> 00:41:42,671
I regret it.

430
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:45,702
Everything.

431
00:41:47,372 --> 00:41:48,702
I regret it all.

432
00:41:50,612 --> 00:41:52,411
This is what I get...

433
00:41:52,411 --> 00:41:54,541
for going out of my way to help an arrogant jerk like you!

434
00:41:56,212 --> 00:41:57,781
Give it back.

435
00:41:58,252 --> 00:41:59,881
I want my life back!

436
00:42:00,021 --> 00:42:01,222
We're done here.

437
00:42:07,362 --> 00:42:08,921
I guess you can call it stalking.

438
00:42:09,832 --> 00:42:11,161
Even if you file charges against her,

439
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:12,962
she'll only get probation...

440
00:42:12,962 --> 00:42:14,362
by reason of insanity.

441
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:16,602
Could you offer her leniency?

442
00:42:16,631 --> 00:42:19,171
No way. She's not even in remorse.

443
00:42:19,502 --> 00:42:20,901
Have you filed for a warrant?

444
00:42:21,301 --> 00:42:24,271
It takes time to write up a request for a warrant,

445
00:42:24,641 --> 00:42:25,712
so I'll be in touch.

446
00:42:26,982 --> 00:42:28,781
By the way, Mr. Park,

447
00:42:29,411 --> 00:42:32,622
have we perhaps met before?

448
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:35,482
You and me?

449
00:42:36,551 --> 00:42:38,222
No, we met yesterday for the first time.

450
00:42:41,092 --> 00:42:43,232
- I see. - Please calm down.

451
00:42:50,202 --> 00:42:51,202
I'm sure of it.

452
00:42:51,732 --> 00:42:53,271
I may not be that memorable,

453
00:42:53,572 --> 00:42:55,972
but you sure are.

454
00:42:56,872 --> 00:42:58,271
I mean that as a compliment.

455
00:43:02,411 --> 00:43:03,482
Thank you, then.

456
00:43:11,551 --> 00:43:14,692
This is a murderous company! You must apologize! Apologize!

457
00:43:14,891 --> 00:43:17,291
This is a murderous company! You must apologize! Apologize!

458
00:43:17,291 --> 00:43:20,362
You must apologize! Apologize!

459
00:43:21,602 --> 00:43:23,102
How long hasn't he been back?

460
00:43:57,832 --> 00:43:58,931
You're here.

461
00:43:59,572 --> 00:44:01,801
Hey. What were you up to?

462
00:44:02,242 --> 00:44:04,712
You should stay for lunch. It's all done, so have a seat.

463
00:44:10,853 --> 00:44:13,664
Isn't it too hot for cooking? We could've ordered out.

464
00:44:13,758 --> 00:44:16,158
Nothing I do compares to the hard work you do.

465
00:44:16,457 --> 00:44:17,857
We should eat.

466
00:44:22,967 --> 00:44:25,467
What's wrong? Go ahead and dig in.

467
00:44:26,067 --> 00:44:27,967
You love whatever I make.

468
00:44:29,538 --> 00:44:30,768
Right.

469
00:44:35,438 --> 00:44:38,077
Haven't you been able to sleep?

470
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:42,217
You look exhausted.

471
00:44:45,487 --> 00:44:46,587
Hyun Chae,

472
00:44:50,158 --> 00:44:51,158
you trust me, don't you?

473
00:44:56,367 --> 00:44:57,697
Must I say it in words?

474
00:44:58,898 --> 00:45:00,438
Do I make you question that?

475
00:45:03,168 --> 00:45:04,567
I'm going to make sure of it this time.

476
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:06,678
No, it'll certainly be done.

477
00:45:07,378 --> 00:45:10,447
First, I'll figure out where it all went wrong...

478
00:45:10,778 --> 00:45:11,977
and then set another plan.

479
00:45:16,688 --> 00:45:18,087
I will keep all the promises...

480
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,357
I made to you...

481
00:45:22,827 --> 00:45:23,928
no matter what.

482
00:45:29,058 --> 00:45:30,798
Don't push yourself to hard.

483
00:45:31,898 --> 00:45:33,737
I know you're trying your best.

484
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:41,207
Now, let's eat.

485
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,688
Hey, do you even know how to request a visitation?

486
00:45:58,028 --> 00:46:00,028
I don't know. We'll get it done somehow.

487
00:46:00,628 --> 00:46:01,658
Excuse me.

488
00:46:03,398 --> 00:46:05,268
We're here to visit someone in holding.

489
00:46:05,367 --> 00:46:07,967
Go to the reception and request a visitation.

490
00:46:09,268 --> 00:46:10,538
Where are you going?

491
00:46:12,908 --> 00:46:14,008
Detective.

492
00:46:17,247 --> 00:46:19,447
Could we perhaps talk?

493
00:46:23,388 --> 00:46:25,487
So you're Ms. Han's friends.

494
00:46:26,857 --> 00:46:30,158
Her father died when she was young and her mother's missing.

495
00:46:30,158 --> 00:46:31,987
We're all she has.

496
00:46:31,987 --> 00:46:33,097
We...

497
00:46:33,497 --> 00:46:34,957
Please help us.

498
00:46:35,197 --> 00:46:38,128
Has she been suffering from a mental disorder?

499
00:46:38,867 --> 00:46:41,798
- Sorry? - She keeps talking nonsense.

500
00:46:47,107 --> 00:46:48,378
Once one is arrested,

501
00:46:48,378 --> 00:46:50,747
a warrant must be issued within 48 hours.

502
00:46:51,178 --> 00:46:53,548
From this moment to her sentencing...

503
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,788
will take at least three months even if she only gets a fine.

504
00:46:58,847 --> 00:47:02,317
The last thing you want is for her to end up at a detention center.

505
00:47:04,628 --> 00:47:06,028
How about this then?

506
00:47:06,357 --> 00:47:08,428
It's obvious that she's not in her right mind.

507
00:47:08,528 --> 00:47:10,268
While you still have the time,

508
00:47:10,597 --> 00:47:12,067
hire a lawyer for her...

509
00:47:12,628 --> 00:47:15,497
or reach a settlement with the victim.

510
00:47:21,678 --> 00:47:25,577
(Correct your way with the given time.)

511
00:47:26,317 --> 00:47:27,418
Ae Ri!

512
00:47:27,817 --> 00:47:29,947
How are you doing? Are you okay?

513
00:47:33,487 --> 00:47:34,717
What happened?

514
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:39,188
I don't know.

515
00:47:40,628 --> 00:47:44,798
Why... Why did you get caught and not Kim Jin Ho?

516
00:47:46,237 --> 00:47:47,438
Over the recent weeks,

517
00:47:48,938 --> 00:47:50,908
I've been telling Mr. Kim...

518
00:47:50,908 --> 00:47:53,107
that his daughter will be kidnapped.

519
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:57,648
Apparently, that's now proof of me threatening him.

520
00:48:02,788 --> 00:48:05,617
What about Kim Seo Jin? Have you talked to him?

521
00:48:07,188 --> 00:48:09,788
What did he say? Did he understand your claims?

522
00:48:12,587 --> 00:48:14,327
The Kim Seo Jin I've been talking to...

523
00:48:14,528 --> 00:48:16,467
is the Kim Seo Jin living a month ahead of me.

524
00:48:18,097 --> 00:48:19,227
So?

525
00:48:19,467 --> 00:48:22,737
He won't grant me leniency.

526
00:48:25,337 --> 00:48:26,878
Still,

527
00:48:26,908 --> 00:48:29,477
this all happened because you were protecting his daughter.

528
00:48:29,947 --> 00:48:31,447
How could he be so cruel?

529
00:48:31,678 --> 00:48:34,548
I'll look for a way, so...

530
00:48:36,347 --> 00:48:38,447
don't worry and hang in there.

531
00:48:38,447 --> 00:48:40,918
We're get you a lawyer and do everything we can,

532
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:42,418
so stay strong.

533
00:48:44,487 --> 00:48:46,857
KOSPI dropped three percent...

534
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:49,567
as the stock market went into a cooling-off period.

535
00:48:49,798 --> 00:48:51,898
Next are today's top incidents.

536
00:48:51,997 --> 00:48:53,398
Yesterday, on September 6,

537
00:48:53,398 --> 00:48:55,838
at a charity music event held by Yujung Constructions,

538
00:48:55,838 --> 00:48:58,438
an attempted kidnapping took place.

539
00:48:58,608 --> 00:49:00,878
The suspect caught in the act...

540
00:49:00,878 --> 00:49:02,638
was Ms. Han in her twenties.

541
00:49:02,848 --> 00:49:06,247
Let's take a look at the footage filmed by someone at the scene.

542
00:49:07,348 --> 00:49:10,017
Please step back. Make way.

543
00:49:10,888 --> 00:49:12,957
- Lower the cameras. - That'll be 23 dollars.

544
00:49:12,987 --> 00:49:14,557
- Step aside. - Make way.

545
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:17,588
- You shouldn't be filming. - Aren't you going to let me pay?

546
00:49:19,527 --> 00:49:20,658
Hey!

547
00:49:21,598 --> 00:49:23,527
(Trustworthy Police, Safe Country)

548
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:25,197
(Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency)

549
00:49:25,197 --> 00:49:26,838
My legs are shaking.

550
00:49:30,307 --> 00:49:33,007
I don't know where to go from here.

551
00:49:35,108 --> 00:49:37,378
Where do we get a lawyer for her?

552
00:49:40,517 --> 00:49:42,118
(Restricted Number)

553
00:49:44,388 --> 00:49:46,557
- Hello? - Soo Jung, it's me.

554
00:49:48,388 --> 00:49:49,487
Mom!

555
00:49:50,727 --> 00:49:53,398
Is it Ae Ri's mom? Where is she?

556
00:49:53,658 --> 00:49:55,098
Mom!

557
00:49:56,398 --> 00:49:59,967
Please don't tell me that it's Ae Ri. Tell me I'm wrong!

558
00:50:00,368 --> 00:50:02,267
What will we do?

559
00:50:04,007 --> 00:50:06,537
Ae Ri's in big trouble!

560
00:50:14,217 --> 00:50:15,777
(Phone call, Decline, Message)

561
00:50:32,668 --> 00:50:34,168
I told you to be patient.

562
00:50:35,497 --> 00:50:39,838
I've been patient for over 20 years.

563
00:50:40,777 --> 00:50:42,807
How long must I wait?

564
00:50:42,807 --> 00:50:44,648
The plan was met with a hitch.

565
00:50:45,007 --> 00:50:47,017
Stay put if you want what you're after.

566
00:50:47,017 --> 00:50:48,878
Don't you even think about playing me.

567
00:50:48,878 --> 00:50:50,547
Until the day I die,

568
00:50:50,618 --> 00:50:54,388
you'll be caught in my web forever.

569
00:50:55,517 --> 00:50:56,628
I'll...

570
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,257
kill you.

571
00:51:00,928 --> 00:51:02,797
I'm more beneficial to you alive.

572
00:51:03,128 --> 00:51:04,697
Because when I die,

573
00:51:04,928 --> 00:51:08,898
the whole world will finally find out how filthy you are.

574
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:10,908
Get it?

575
00:51:31,858 --> 00:51:34,297
- Yes? - When will you head home?

576
00:51:35,057 --> 00:51:37,128
- I was just about to. - That's great.

577
00:51:37,297 --> 00:51:39,267
Can you pick Da Bin up on your way home?

578
00:51:39,628 --> 00:51:41,598
The babysitter can't today.

579
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:42,598
What about you?

580
00:51:42,598 --> 00:51:45,037
I'm meeting with my fellow ensemble members, remember?

581
00:51:46,838 --> 00:51:48,178
And where's Da Bin?

582
00:51:52,848 --> 00:51:54,047
Da Bin, it must be your dad.

583
00:51:57,247 --> 00:51:58,588
Where are you? Did you enter the building?

584
00:51:58,588 --> 00:51:59,918
- Over here. - Right.

585
00:52:03,128 --> 00:52:05,757
I'm sorry about this. Something urgent came up.

586
00:52:05,757 --> 00:52:07,227
It's all right. You should head out.

587
00:52:08,227 --> 00:52:10,527
You should grab something to eat while you're here...

588
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:12,227
since Ms. Kang will be home late today.

589
00:52:12,797 --> 00:52:13,868
Sure.

590
00:52:14,938 --> 00:52:17,108
Right. Da Bin, I'll get going then.

591
00:52:17,108 --> 00:52:18,537
- See you tomorrow. - Bye!

592
00:52:21,207 --> 00:52:22,237
Eat up.

593
00:52:24,277 --> 00:52:26,207
I should get something to eat too.

594
00:52:27,047 --> 00:52:28,247
Da Bin, stay here and eat.

595
00:52:28,247 --> 00:52:30,088
- I'll go and order some food. - Sure.

596
00:52:34,487 --> 00:52:35,517
It's delicious.

597
00:52:35,588 --> 00:52:36,628
Thank you.

598
00:52:50,938 --> 00:52:52,007
Da Bin?

599
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:56,547
Kim Da Bin?

600
00:53:03,247 --> 00:53:04,287
Da Bin?

601
00:53:08,057 --> 00:53:09,257
Kim Da Bin?

602
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:17,727
Kim Da Bin?

603
00:53:21,037 --> 00:53:22,168
Da Bin!

604
00:53:29,578 --> 00:53:31,977
I thought she was going to the restroom,

605
00:53:32,277 --> 00:53:34,318
so I followed her right after.

606
00:53:40,787 --> 00:53:41,918
Da Bin?

607
00:53:42,918 --> 00:53:43,987
Da Bin...

608
00:53:46,358 --> 00:53:47,757
- Da Bin! - Da Bin!

609
00:53:49,457 --> 00:53:50,527
Kim Da Bin!

610
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:53,767
Have you seen a six-year-old girl with a bob?

611
00:53:56,138 --> 00:53:57,638
- Da Bin? - Da Bin!

612
00:54:03,178 --> 00:54:04,277
Da Bin?

613
00:54:11,947 --> 00:54:13,517
Da Bin...

614
00:54:14,287 --> 00:54:15,888
Where were you?

615
00:54:16,557 --> 00:54:18,128
I thought I had lost you.

616
00:54:20,197 --> 00:54:21,928
Please don't cry. You're okay.

617
00:54:22,158 --> 00:54:23,697
I found you, so we're good.

618
00:54:23,797 --> 00:54:27,297
Dad, do you hate me because I don't behave?

619
00:54:27,398 --> 00:54:30,408
No, I don't hate you at all.

620
00:54:31,207 --> 00:54:34,908
I won't be able to breathe without you.

621
00:54:51,557 --> 00:54:52,658
Ms. Han.

622
00:54:54,497 --> 00:54:55,628
Ms. Han?

623
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:57,697
Right.

624
00:54:57,697 --> 00:54:59,938
You should at least eat, you know.

625
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:02,938
Not eating will only hurt you more.

626
00:55:07,138 --> 00:55:08,237
Detective.

627
00:55:10,707 --> 00:55:13,078
Can you please get me my phone?

628
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:17,118
I won't have it for long. Just one minute.

629
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,688
I only need it for one minute.

630
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,888
That's not something I have the liberty to grant.

631
00:55:23,888 --> 00:55:27,797
I'll only make one phone call at exactly 10:33pm.

632
00:55:28,497 --> 00:55:30,428
I'll make the call in front of you...

633
00:55:30,428 --> 00:55:32,668
and give it right back.

634
00:55:33,128 --> 00:55:34,168
Please?

635
00:55:37,868 --> 00:55:39,368
Don't mind me.

636
00:55:45,848 --> 00:55:46,918
Just one phone call.

637
00:55:47,148 --> 00:55:48,178
Thank you.

638
00:55:51,418 --> 00:55:52,747
(Kim Seo Jin)

639
00:56:12,737 --> 00:56:13,838
Please...

640
00:56:15,408 --> 00:56:16,807
Please pick up.

641
00:56:20,848 --> 00:56:21,918
Please...

642
00:56:23,848 --> 00:56:25,247
Please pick up.

643
00:56:25,247 --> 00:56:28,118
Your call cannot be connected. You'll be redirected to voice mail.

644
00:56:28,487 --> 00:56:30,858
Your call will be charged after the beep.

645
00:56:33,297 --> 00:56:34,828
Why are you doing this to me?

646
00:56:36,668 --> 00:56:38,328
You can't just disappear like this.

647
00:56:40,767 --> 00:56:42,037
Pick up.

648
00:56:42,537 --> 00:56:44,168
Pick up, darn it!

649
00:56:44,338 --> 00:56:45,608
Ms. Han, the phone.

650
00:56:46,908 --> 00:56:48,138
Please pick up.

651
00:56:48,878 --> 00:56:50,408
I was naive.

652
00:56:51,108 --> 00:56:54,378
I shouldn't have cared what happened to Da Bin,

653
00:56:55,277 --> 00:56:56,918
but I was a fool.

654
00:56:57,787 --> 00:57:00,118
What about my mom?

655
00:57:01,217 --> 00:57:03,428
What will happen to my mom?

656
00:57:04,457 --> 00:57:06,858
What about my mom?

657
00:57:23,348 --> 00:57:28,247
(A General Ward)

658
00:57:47,037 --> 00:57:48,098
How's Ji Ah?

659
00:57:48,967 --> 00:57:52,307
It's how you see. What now though?

660
00:57:52,668 --> 00:57:54,138
Does our deal still stand?

661
00:57:54,737 --> 00:57:55,807
Of course.

662
00:57:57,148 --> 00:57:58,707
We were met with a curve ball, that's all.

663
00:57:59,648 --> 00:58:01,247
Just consider the plan postponed.

664
00:58:01,947 --> 00:58:03,918
Why was Han Ae Ri there though?

665
00:58:05,987 --> 00:58:07,188
That I don't know.

666
00:58:08,658 --> 00:58:10,957
Was your last encounter with her at your house?

667
00:58:11,328 --> 00:58:14,598
No, she came by this hospital looking for her mother.

668
00:58:16,057 --> 00:58:17,128
Her mother?

669
00:58:18,297 --> 00:58:19,828
Didn't Mr. Lee tell you?

670
00:58:20,467 --> 00:58:22,737
Her mom is Kwak Song Ja.

671
00:58:24,568 --> 00:58:25,668
Kwak Song Ja?

672
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:28,678
Who's that?

673
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:31,578
She's a bereaved family member...

674
00:58:31,878 --> 00:58:34,547
of one of the victims in the Taejung Town incident.

675
00:58:36,148 --> 00:58:37,818
Mr. Lee has been looking for her.

676
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:40,757
When I told him that I was looking for her,

677
00:58:40,757 --> 00:58:43,287
he asked me to tell him once I found out where she was.

678
00:58:43,688 --> 00:58:45,457
Didn't he inform you of this?

679
00:58:47,727 --> 00:58:48,797
Of course, he told me.

680
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:50,928
It just slipped my mind.

681
00:59:07,277 --> 00:59:08,477
Is that really all?

682
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:11,648
She keeps insisting that she was only trying...

683
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:13,148
to protect Mr. Kim's daughter.

684
00:59:14,618 --> 00:59:15,987
She fabricated text messages...

685
00:59:15,987 --> 00:59:17,787
to make it seem like they have been texting each other.

686
00:59:18,858 --> 00:59:20,898
How do you know that they were fabricated?

687
00:59:21,098 --> 00:59:22,358
Because Mr. Kim's phone shows no trace...

688
00:59:22,358 --> 00:59:24,527
of him being in contact with her.

689
00:59:28,037 --> 00:59:30,967
May I perhaps see those text messages?

690
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:32,108
That I can't allow.

691
00:59:35,878 --> 00:59:37,408
I'm here by the chairman's orders.

692
00:59:37,777 --> 00:59:41,717
He's worried about this incident hurting the company image, you see.

693
00:59:42,618 --> 00:59:43,717
I hope you'll be understanding.

694
01:00:00,967 --> 01:00:04,267
(This is Han Ae Ri's family.)

695
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:06,938
This is Han Ae Ri's family. Could I ask for some of your time?

696
01:00:07,037 --> 01:00:08,378
I'm waiting outside your office building.

697
01:00:21,088 --> 01:00:22,257
Yes, this is Kim Seo Jin.

698
01:00:22,757 --> 01:00:26,527
The suspect wishes to speak to you today.

699
01:00:27,158 --> 01:00:29,158
Why don't you hear what they have to say?

700
01:00:30,598 --> 01:00:31,598
Sure thing.

701
01:00:35,797 --> 01:00:38,838
(This is Han Ae Ri's family.)

702
01:00:43,747 --> 01:00:44,747
This is Kim Seo Jin.

703
01:00:45,247 --> 01:00:47,878
We'll meet in an hour at the café in front of the office.

704
01:01:11,338 --> 01:01:12,668
You said you were Han Ae Ri's family.

705
01:01:15,307 --> 01:01:16,608
We're friends who are close enough to be.

706
01:01:17,408 --> 01:01:21,078
Her parents couldn't make it for personal reasons.

707
01:01:22,078 --> 01:01:23,217
What is it do you have to say?

708
01:01:27,858 --> 01:01:29,858
Please show her leniency.

709
01:01:31,088 --> 01:01:32,858
Ae Ri's sorry for what she did.

710
01:01:33,188 --> 01:01:36,158
- If you let this slide... - She didn't seem to be in remorse.

711
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:38,398
I don't think you speak for her at all.

712
01:01:39,227 --> 01:01:41,697
Did you read the text messages on her phone?

713
01:01:41,767 --> 01:01:42,868
I did.

714
01:01:43,467 --> 01:01:44,638
They were ridiculous.

715
01:01:46,108 --> 01:01:49,138
Did you read every one of them?

716
01:01:50,578 --> 01:01:53,178
Even if they were fabricated by her,

717
01:01:53,848 --> 01:01:56,717
you can tell that she never intended to hurt your family.

718
01:01:56,717 --> 01:01:57,848
Diminished capacity.

719
01:01:58,848 --> 01:02:00,717
You know what that means, right?

720
01:02:00,757 --> 01:02:03,487
It refers to one's inability to distinguish right from wrong,

721
01:02:03,487 --> 01:02:06,188
which diminishes one's capacity to make logical decisions.

722
01:02:06,287 --> 01:02:07,328
In other words,

723
01:02:08,158 --> 01:02:10,767
she can't control her own mind or actions.

724
01:02:11,828 --> 01:02:15,037
So why must I show leniency toward a ticking time bomb?

725
01:02:15,197 --> 01:02:16,668
She also targeted...

726
01:02:17,838 --> 01:02:19,838
a helpless young child,

727
01:02:20,438 --> 01:02:22,378
- which makes her crueller. - Ae Ri...

728
01:02:23,338 --> 01:02:24,608
isn't like that.

729
01:02:26,108 --> 01:02:28,217
Besides, you were the one...

730
01:02:28,217 --> 01:02:29,477
who shook her life by asking for her help!

731
01:02:31,348 --> 01:02:32,588
I see I wasted my time.

732
01:02:34,888 --> 01:02:36,688
We won't let her anywhere near you again,

733
01:02:36,688 --> 01:02:38,057
so please forgive her just this once.

734
01:02:40,358 --> 01:02:41,858
There's no need for you to plead her case.

735
01:02:42,858 --> 01:02:44,068
The law will take care of it.

736
01:02:51,938 --> 01:02:53,368
What a colossal jerk.

737
01:02:58,477 --> 01:02:59,648
Yes, this is Kim Seo Jin.

738
01:03:00,148 --> 01:03:01,977
The chairman wishes to speak to you.

739
01:03:03,277 --> 01:03:04,318
Got it.

741
01:03:10,527 --> 01:03:11,658
Seo Jin,

742
01:03:11,987 --> 01:03:14,527
you should launch the Taejung New Town project.

745
01:04:14,818 --> 01:04:15,888
What...

746
01:04:16,517 --> 01:04:18,757
Your safety helmet. Your safety helmet!

747
01:04:20,757 --> 01:04:22,297
Put on your safety helmet!

748
01:04:23,128 --> 01:04:24,267
Watch out!

750
01:05:21,692 --> 01:05:22,831
Yes, Detective Lee.

751
01:05:23,732 --> 01:05:25,202
I'll check right now.

752
01:05:27,831 --> 01:05:29,801

What on earth is all this?

755
01:05:56,262 --> 01:05:58,332
Ms. Han, you're good to go.

756
01:06:19,981 --> 01:06:22,292
Mr. Kim dropped the charges.

(Kim Seo Jin)

758
01:06:49,352 --> 01:06:50,921
This'll be our last call.

759
01:06:51,952 --> 01:06:54,522
I will no longer believe anything you say.

760
01:06:55,151 --> 01:06:56,622
Don't ever call me again.

761
01:06:58,492 --> 01:06:59,792
Ms. Han.

(Han Ae Ri)

763
01:07:07,631 --> 01:07:08,832
Help me.

764
01:07:12,472 --> 01:07:13,671
Mr. Kim?

765
01:07:14,711 --> 01:07:15,742
Mr. Kim!

766
01:07:15,742 --> 01:07:17,171
My location...

767
01:07:19,312 --> 01:07:20,412
is...

768
01:07:24,522 --> 01:07:26,281
Mr. Kim!

773
01:08:10,199 --> 01:08:12,730
Those images in my head seem too real.

774
01:08:12,730 --> 01:08:14,369
Why do you keep hovering around Mr. Kim?

775
01:08:14,369 --> 01:08:16,099
You're one to talk.

776
01:08:16,099 --> 01:08:18,340
Drop the act and stop pretending to be on his side.

777
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:22,080
Should I? It's about time we tally the numbers.

778
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:25,009
I'll make you the happiest woman ever. I promise.

779
01:08:25,409 --> 01:08:28,049
No, this can't be true.

780
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:30,020

781
01:08:36,119 --> 01:08:37,590
Wake up!
