1
00:00:33,741 --> 00:00:35,411
I was saved after 31 days.

2
00:00:38,021 --> 00:00:40,320
I broke the record of the survivor who lasted the longest...

3
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,720
in the collapse of Sampoong Department Store.

4
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,760
A week has passed.

5
00:00:53,161 --> 00:00:54,570
My dad never came to see me...

6
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,830
while I was in the hospital.

7
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:04,171
This is a certification from Yujung Constructions to you.

8
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:07,080
They promised to cover your tuition...

9
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,681
and hire you as soon as you graduate.

10
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:15,250
- But the compensation... - Teacher.

11
00:01:18,561 --> 00:01:20,621
Why hasn't my dad visited me?

12
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:25,330
His name wasn't on the casualty list.

13
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:34,100
Your father passed away.

14
00:01:36,011 --> 00:01:37,841
Before you were rescued,

15
00:01:38,981 --> 00:01:40,940
he thought you had died...

16
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,481
and jumped off a building.

17
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,160
I don't know where you hid it,

18
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,401
but I doubt it's more precious than your remaining daughter.

19
00:02:06,401 --> 00:02:08,110
If you want to save her,

20
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,770
you better get up.

21
00:02:12,911 --> 00:02:14,981
Give it some thought while you're lying there.

22
00:02:16,481 --> 00:02:19,620
Think about who you must side with to save yourself.

23
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:40,840
(Episode 15)

24
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:44,370
Hello. Can Mr. Kim talk?

25
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:46,710
I'm not sure.

26
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:48,680
I heard there was a pupillary response.

27
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,280
Let's hurry.

28
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,520
I was told that he had regained consciousness.

29
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:05,131
Do you... Do you think he can hear us?

30
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,101
Mr. Kim, open your eyes.

31
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:11,701
Do you remember where you put the package?

32
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:14,641
Say something!

33
00:03:15,411 --> 00:03:16,740
Mr. Im.

34
00:03:26,251 --> 00:03:27,421
Mr. Kim.

35
00:03:29,851 --> 00:03:33,761
Ji Ah is doing well.

36
00:03:38,101 --> 00:03:40,460
If you can hear me, don't worry about anything.

37
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:44,870
Please hang in there...

38
00:03:45,971 --> 00:03:47,671
so Ji Ah will have a father growing up.

39
00:03:58,421 --> 00:03:59,520
Mr. Kim.

40
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,520
Please move aside. Mr. Kim. Do you hear me?

41
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:08,990
Please go out. He needs to rest.

42
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,100
Use this phone to reach me from now on.

43
00:04:21,871 --> 00:04:23,470
I did need a way to reach you...

44
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,280
since I could only talk to your future with mine.

45
00:04:27,381 --> 00:04:31,011
Ms. Han, how much have I found out in the future?

46
00:04:31,681 --> 00:04:33,051
Did I find the package?

47
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,751
You did,

48
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,491
but since Mr. Kim Jin Ho was in an accident yesterday,

49
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:41,321
you probably don't have it in the future anymore.

50
00:04:41,631 --> 00:04:42,960
Since he's bedridden,

51
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,131
he probably couldn't have delivered it to my mom.

52
00:04:47,061 --> 00:04:48,330
You recognize him, don't you?

53
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:52,571
(99 percent match with Park Joo Young's fingerprints)

54
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,241
How do you know him?

55
00:04:54,241 --> 00:04:56,210
He tried to kill Mr. Kim.

56
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,451
I suspect him of killing my father,

57
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,821
but due to lack of evidence, I couldn't catch him.

58
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,761
Have things changed there? Has it been revealed?

59
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:16,960
No. I saw him in the alleyway in front of Mr. Kim's yesterday.

60
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,600
But that proves nothing.

61
00:05:23,371 --> 00:05:25,040
Chairman Yu must've hired him.

62
00:05:25,941 --> 00:05:27,670
We need to catch Park Joo Young first.

63
00:05:27,941 --> 00:05:30,670
We need to catch him in order to retrieve the package...

64
00:05:31,141 --> 00:05:33,141
and save you in the future.

65
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,790
Your food's here.

66
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,431
Let me know if you crave any side dishes,

67
00:05:52,431 --> 00:05:54,131
and I'll make them for you.

68
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:55,770
Thank you.

69
00:05:56,001 --> 00:05:59,170
Eat up if you want to grow as big as me.

70
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,011
- What's wrong? - Hello?

71
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,181
My teeth are already healthy.

72
00:06:11,881 --> 00:06:12,980
What's wrong?

73
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,191
- Were you very startled? - Hi.

74
00:06:19,691 --> 00:06:20,720
Is something wrong?

75
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:23,191
She seems very shook up.

76
00:06:23,191 --> 00:06:26,001
She heard the phone ring and panicked.

77
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,131
Don't cry, Ji Ah. Don't cry.

78
00:06:30,131 --> 00:06:31,770
It's okay.

79
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,980
Ji Ah, were you very startled?

80
00:06:42,051 --> 00:06:44,381
You'll feel better after some sleep.

81
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,751
When is my dad coming?

82
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:51,491
Do you miss him?

83
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,001
I also miss my dad a lot.

84
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,900
Where is he?

85
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,170
He's a bit far away.

86
00:07:09,071 --> 00:07:11,941
That's why it'll take a very long time...

87
00:07:12,381 --> 00:07:14,111
for me to reach him.

88
00:07:15,511 --> 00:07:18,350
No. I had thought he was far away,

89
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,090
but it turned out that he was always by my side.

90
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,730
Just as much as you miss him...

91
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:34,201
No, he'll miss you...

92
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,970
a lot more than you miss him.

93
00:07:40,801 --> 00:07:44,311
I'll stay by your side until you see him again.

94
00:07:45,741 --> 00:07:49,410
So tell me every time you're in pain...

95
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:51,480
or in fear of something.

96
00:07:52,051 --> 00:07:53,080
Okay?

97
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,520
Promise me.

98
00:08:01,991 --> 00:08:03,131
Let's go to bed.

99
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,741
What if Mr. Kim falls unconscious again?

100
00:08:19,141 --> 00:08:22,210
It'll take some time until he fully recovers.

101
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,980
He's been hanging in there all this time,

102
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,280
so let's wait a bit more.

103
00:08:30,621 --> 00:08:31,821
Until when?

104
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:34,861
What more can we, from the past, do?

105
00:08:35,461 --> 00:08:37,731
If one thing changes, another misfortune happens.

106
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,131
Ae Ri is...

107
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,121
Mr. Im.

108
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,121
It's not over until it's over.

109
00:09:04,221 --> 00:09:07,420
Let's save Ms. Han.

110
00:09:10,131 --> 00:09:12,400
I'll keep an eye on Mr. Kim's progress.

111
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,310
(Hyun Chae)

112
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,751
- Hello? - You should...

113
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,280
come home.

114
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,891
I'll leave.

115
00:10:16,731 --> 00:10:18,361
You should be...

116
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,400
with Da Bin.

117
00:10:38,381 --> 00:10:41,920
(Kim Seo Jin)

118
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,351
Ms. Han, I'm off to find Kim Jin Ho.

119
00:10:44,851 --> 00:10:46,020
A month has passed,

120
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,420
so he might have regained consciousness.

121
00:10:48,961 --> 00:10:51,660
I'll head to the prosecution once I retrieve the package.

122
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:00,241
- Hello, Ms. Han? - Did you meet with Mr. Kim Jin Ho?

123
00:11:00,641 --> 00:11:01,800
How is he?

124
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,871
He's still unconscious.

125
00:11:05,511 --> 00:11:08,650
I didn't find the package.

126
00:11:11,351 --> 00:11:14,481
And Seo Do Kyun died.

127
00:11:16,091 --> 00:11:17,290
Was it Chairman Yu again?

128
00:11:17,491 --> 00:11:19,420
- No. - Then who was it?

129
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,160
Why then? How?

130
00:11:22,461 --> 00:11:24,391
Is your wife perhaps involved?

131
00:11:26,261 --> 00:11:29,430
It'll soon be that day.

132
00:11:31,001 --> 00:11:32,341
The day...

133
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,101
I saw my wife with Seo Do Kyun...

134
00:11:35,871 --> 00:11:37,440
after tracking Da Bin's toy.

135
00:11:40,141 --> 00:11:41,511
In your timeline,

136
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,711
I still don't know, do I?

137
00:11:44,881 --> 00:11:46,820
I don't think you do.

138
00:11:47,851 --> 00:11:51,050
How should I tell him? Should I just say it?

139
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,091
No, don't tell him anything.

140
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,530
He'll soon...

141
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,461
find out anyway.

142
00:12:17,981 --> 00:12:20,280
Go, Hyun Chae. Get out of here!

143
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,020
Get out of here. Just go!

144
00:12:23,351 --> 00:12:25,091
Run away as fast as you can.

145
00:12:25,991 --> 00:12:27,160
Hyun Chae...

146
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,481
I'll collect my things and leave soon.

147
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,060
In your state?

148
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,761
Just stay.

149
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,141
(I love you.)

150
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,790
(I love you.)

151
00:14:11,361 --> 00:14:13,001
(With you, at Samwoon Park)

152
00:14:13,001 --> 00:14:14,461
Don't pretend like you know it all.

153
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:15,700
I'll bet my life...

154
00:14:17,331 --> 00:14:19,101
with someone worthy as I'd like.

155
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,570
Ji Ah, what are you doing still up?

156
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,711
It's late. You should go to bed.

157
00:15:46,391 --> 00:15:50,331
Ji Ah, say that again. What did you just say to me?

158
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,261
I... saw everything.

159
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:20,320
(Han Ae Ri)

160
00:16:25,231 --> 00:16:26,461
He's not answering.

161
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:36,641
I'm in your neighbourhood and will be there soon.

162
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,690
Ji Ah,

163
00:16:54,961 --> 00:16:57,331
it must've been terrifying for you.

164
00:17:05,801 --> 00:17:07,000
Ji Ah.

165
00:17:10,871 --> 00:17:12,541
Would you be able...

166
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:17,180
to recognize that guy if you saw him again?

167
00:17:22,021 --> 00:17:24,121
I'm amazed to hear that.

168
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,521
How big was it?

169
00:17:27,021 --> 00:17:28,720
- About this big. - You liar.

170
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,531
Are you Superintendent Park Joo Young?

171
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,160
Who's asking?

172
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,960
We have questions...

173
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,031
regarding a recent attempted murder case.

174
00:17:35,031 --> 00:17:36,430
Will you come with us?

175
00:17:36,631 --> 00:17:38,031
I'm afraid you have the wrong person.

176
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:40,240
We'd appreciate your cooperation.

177
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,470
Which district station are you boys from?

178
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:46,841
It'd be better for you to come with us voluntarily.

179
00:17:51,281 --> 00:17:52,381
Lead the way.

180
00:18:05,801 --> 00:18:07,331
You know Mr. Kim Jin Ho, right?

181
00:18:09,271 --> 00:18:12,470
- Who? - The man living at...

182
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,571
330-29 Geonnam-dong.

183
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:17,071
- Don't you know him? - I'm drawing a blank.

184
00:18:17,841 --> 00:18:20,841
Where were you at 9pm on September 27?

185
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:24,081
It was after hours, so I was probably home.

186
00:18:24,781 --> 00:18:26,321
Can anyone verify that?

187
00:18:28,321 --> 00:18:29,891
I live alone.

188
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,420
Please just answer me truthfully.

189
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:37,331
Between 8pm and 9pm on September 27,

190
00:18:38,061 --> 00:18:39,930
your cell phone...

191
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:43,571
was pinged in the vicinity of 330-29 Geonnam-dong.

192
00:18:50,571 --> 00:18:52,341
Is this how you investigate cases?

193
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:57,811
Then you should question every owner of every cell phone...

194
00:18:57,811 --> 00:18:59,781
that was also in that area.

195
00:19:01,051 --> 00:19:02,180
Don't you agree?

196
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,131
Well, there's a witness.

197
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:14,301
A witness? Who?

198
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,670
Did this person really see me trying to kill a person?

199
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,440
The witness is here...

200
00:19:20,271 --> 00:19:22,440
and will be identifying you soon.

201
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,510
I see.

202
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,381
Go ahead.

203
00:19:27,781 --> 00:19:29,851
If this turns out to be a bogus claim,

204
00:19:30,351 --> 00:19:34,250
you'll be answering to the trouble you caused.

205
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,811
Ji Ah, is that man the one you saw that night?

206
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,141
It's all right.

207
00:20:02,881 --> 00:20:05,680
He can't see you while you're here,

208
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,220
so take a look at him.

209
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,220
Is he the man you saw?

210
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:57,500
It seems like your witness failed to identify me,

211
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,801
so how long are you going to keep me here?

212
00:21:03,811 --> 00:21:05,781
Ji Ah, it's all right.

213
00:21:06,281 --> 00:21:07,611
I know this is painful.

214
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,581
You don't have to do this if it hurts too much.

215
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,510
It's him.

216
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,220
What was that, Ji Ah?

217
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,720
It's him.

218
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,750
Are you sure?

219
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,821
Was it that man?

220
00:21:33,871 --> 00:21:34,871
(Interrogation Room)

221
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:41,210
Mr. Park Joo Young. You are under arrest for attempted murder.

222
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,051
Are you all crazy?

223
00:21:45,051 --> 00:21:46,881
You may choose to stay silent.

224
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,891
Everything you say can be and will be used against you.

225
00:21:50,121 --> 00:21:52,420
You have the right to consult an attorney.

226
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,131
Let's go quietly.

227
00:21:57,591 --> 00:21:59,631
Darn it. What's with you all?

228
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,301
Let me go. I said let go!

229
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:12,141
Okay.

230
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,660
What will happen now?

231
00:22:27,861 --> 00:22:29,531
Will Park Joo Young get locked up in prison?

232
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:33,561
Mr. Park said he'll share the progress of the investigation.

233
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,631
What about his other crimes?

234
00:22:37,031 --> 00:22:40,240
I hope they could reinvestigate your father's case with this chance.

235
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,710
I don't expect them to do that much.

236
00:22:42,811 --> 00:22:46,440
What's important is that they find out his instigator was...

237
00:22:46,881 --> 00:22:48,710
Chairman Yu.

238
00:22:49,851 --> 00:22:51,980
Both Park Joo Young and Lee Taek Gyu are...

239
00:22:52,281 --> 00:22:54,121
nothing but Chairman Yu's pawns.

240
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,220
Did you talk to me from a month later?

241
00:22:58,891 --> 00:23:00,361
Don't be alarmed and listen up.

242
00:23:01,591 --> 00:23:04,831
Mr. Seo Do Kyun will die in a month.

243
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:09,601
Why would he die?

244
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,440
Did he have the evidence with him?

245
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:16,440
Mr. Seo did have it with him,

246
00:23:16,611 --> 00:23:19,581
but it was for another reason that didn't involve Chairman Yu.

247
00:23:20,141 --> 00:23:23,210
So he doesn't know where the evidence is.

248
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,851
What was the other reason?

249
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,440
Come in.

250
00:23:56,081 --> 00:23:58,381
It's the video from the charity concert.

251
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,150
Thank you.

252
00:24:47,061 --> 00:24:49,400
Da Bin, wash up, then come and eat.

253
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,601
Okay.

254
00:24:50,831 --> 00:24:52,331
Wash your hands clean.

255
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,500
Okay.

256
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,440
Da Bin, come here.

257
00:25:01,141 --> 00:25:03,381
Thank you so much.

258
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,220
What do you think? Do you like it?

259
00:25:08,621 --> 00:25:09,950
Go grab a seat. Let's eat.

260
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,500
Mr. Kim.

261
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:04,311
Mr. Kim, are you all right?

262
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:57,011
Mr. Park Joo Young, come out.

263
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,580
Come on out.

264
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,160
I'm going to stay silent. I already made myself clear.

265
00:27:13,561 --> 00:27:15,860
We found these in your car.

266
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,930
These shoes have...

267
00:27:18,731 --> 00:27:21,640
the same soles as the footprints found in Mr. Kim Jin Ho's house.

268
00:27:21,741 --> 00:27:23,041
You still have nothing to say?

269
00:27:24,971 --> 00:27:27,781
Mr. Kim came to the police station himself...

270
00:27:27,941 --> 00:27:30,180
and asked me about the accident from 19 years ago.

271
00:27:30,211 --> 00:27:32,981
I can keep Seo Jin under control.

272
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:36,721
What if he finds that thing Kim Yoo Seok had?

273
00:27:37,751 --> 00:27:40,991
How can he find that when even I couldn't find it?

274
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,890
Don't worry about anything...

275
00:27:44,461 --> 00:27:45,791
and keep doing things as you have.

276
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:50,001
There's nothing else I worry about as long as I'm under your shadow.

277
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,900
Even if you must quit your job, you can always join my company.

278
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,211
Mr. Park.

279
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,910
Will you continue to be uncooperative?

280
00:28:00,781 --> 00:28:02,781
You can at least answer my question.

281
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:05,281
Nothing in the Constitution or the Criminal Procedure Code...

282
00:28:05,451 --> 00:28:08,320
says I must cooperate with your investigation,

283
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,521
you jerk.

284
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,620
If you know the law so well,

285
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,761
you know that the evidence can prove your charges.

286
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:18,231
You're aware that choosing to stay silent...

287
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:22,031
can be insisted as an attempt to destroy the evidence, right?

288
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,100
Do as you like.

289
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,971
Talk to my attorney if you wish.

290
00:28:32,981 --> 00:28:34,481
I hate that guy.

291
00:28:34,981 --> 00:28:36,610
How can he be like that?

292
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:40,650
He doesn't care if he gets fired, as if he has nothing to lose.

293
00:28:41,521 --> 00:28:43,451
Doesn't it seem like someone's behind him?

294
00:28:44,491 --> 00:28:47,221
It'll be game set if Kim Jin Ho wakes up and gives his testimony.

295
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,961
How is he?

296
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,130
His condition gets better, then it gets worse the next second.

297
00:28:52,191 --> 00:28:54,630
Write up a report with what we have and give it to the prosecution.

298
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:57,201
He didn't say anything I can write down...

299
00:28:58,731 --> 00:28:59,900
Yes, sir.

300
00:29:03,471 --> 00:29:05,471
If one gets locked up, one should get freed.

301
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,910
I have a lot of work to do, but I can't move them forward...

302
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,380
without my hands and feet.

303
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:14,481
I'll move this forward quickly so it won't cause an inconvenience.

304
00:29:15,281 --> 00:29:17,721
And let me know if you need anything as you work.

305
00:29:37,941 --> 00:29:39,241
Hello?

306
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,910
You didn't forget about our trip, did you?

307
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,751
When was it again?

308
00:29:44,211 --> 00:29:48,080
October 9. Da Bin is really excited, so we have to go.

309
00:29:48,521 --> 00:29:50,051
Make sure you're free on that day.

310
00:29:51,191 --> 00:29:53,291
Listen carefully. On October 9,

311
00:29:54,561 --> 00:29:57,561
Da Bin and Hyun Chae will die in a car accident.

312
00:29:58,791 --> 00:30:02,400
And I'll get chased by the police after that accident.

313
00:30:03,031 --> 00:30:04,170
I can't make it on that day.

314
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:07,741
I don't think I can go on a trip for a while.

315
00:30:09,301 --> 00:30:11,541
I'm busy. I have to go. We'll talk later.

316
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,741
Honey...

317
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,670
Hello?

318
00:30:38,701 --> 00:30:42,140
I remember everything.

319
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:46,941
Let's meet right now.

320
00:30:51,511 --> 00:30:53,680
On the day I followed Da Bin's location tracker,

321
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,751
I remembered what I saw there...

322
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:00,890
and how I blacked out.

323
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,191
You said Seo Do Kyun will die in a month.

324
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:04,930
For what reason?

325
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,801
And who killed him?

326
00:31:09,771 --> 00:31:11,630
How much do you know about Ms. Kang Hyun Chae?

327
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:13,340
Do I still need to know more?

328
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:19,311
It's painful to face the truth,

329
00:31:19,941 --> 00:31:23,380
but there's nothing more miserable than believing a lie as the truth.

330
00:31:24,511 --> 00:31:26,051
I'm ready to face...

331
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,320
anything.

332
00:31:31,021 --> 00:31:32,521
Ms. Kang has...

333
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,890
a biological father that no one knows of.

334
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,860
The situation must've been very dangerous.

335
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:46,271
Mr. Seo got stabbed trying to save Ms. Kang...

336
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:47,701
when she was held captive by her father.

337
00:32:01,721 --> 00:32:05,920
I thought we'll see a better future if we changed the past.

338
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:10,590
Do you regret getting a peek of the future...

339
00:32:11,461 --> 00:32:12,860
after meeting me?

340
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,031
In the past, present, and future,

341
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,441
I never expected to live my life without any pain.

342
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,070
However,

343
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:28,110
there won't be any hope unless I face the truth.

344
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,610
That's one thing I do know.

345
00:32:44,491 --> 00:32:46,400
Inmate 0204, Lee Taek Gyu. You're free to go.

346
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,191
Hey, where are you?

347
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,631
I've got good connections.

348
00:33:19,601 --> 00:33:21,770
No one can keep me down no matter what they do.

349
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,140
Tell the boys to come out.

350
00:33:25,041 --> 00:33:27,041
Let's grab a drink before my big day.

351
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:46,990
You'll be released on bail tomorrow.

352
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:50,130
Get there first as soon as you get released.

353
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:54,270
(Geumdal Pay Parking, 63E4057)

354
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:00,611
This one will be your last job.

355
00:34:03,481 --> 00:34:07,550
(Pay Parking)

356
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,081
- Car number 4057. - Okay.

357
00:34:34,481 --> 00:34:38,611
(Lee Hyeon Do, flight from Incheon to Miami)

358
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,150
(Lee Hyeon Do)

359
00:34:49,691 --> 00:34:50,891
It's okay.

360
00:34:51,061 --> 00:34:52,561
But I don't get it.

361
00:34:52,731 --> 00:34:54,861
Once you get the evidence, it'll be over.

362
00:34:54,861 --> 00:34:57,100
- But it keeps getting worse. - That's enough to...

363
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,501
- Hey. - Here you are, sir.

364
00:34:58,531 --> 00:34:59,570
Mr. Park.

365
00:35:01,471 --> 00:35:02,971
Lee Taek Gyu was released.

366
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:06,070
What? How?

367
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,610
He got released on bail today.

368
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:09,311
Who paid for him?

369
00:35:09,811 --> 00:35:11,181
I'm not sure about that.

370
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:15,380
Let Mr. Kim Seo Jin know.

371
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,151
It took so much work to arrest him.

372
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:26,061
(Yujung Constructions)

373
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,330
Mr. Kim.

374
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:01,200
Leave it and go.

375
00:36:02,401 --> 00:36:04,471
It's the draft of the proposal you mentioned.

376
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:07,001
- If you give me feedback, I'll... - Leave it and go.

377
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:10,971
Yes, sir.

378
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:16,580
Mr. Seo.

379
00:36:19,251 --> 00:36:21,681
How much do you know about Kang Hyun Chae?

380
00:36:25,091 --> 00:36:27,820
- Pardon? - Her dad's business failed,

381
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,420
so her parents went to the U.S.

382
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,790
Her family didn't do so well for a moment,

383
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:36,301
but she's a music student who always grew up in a rich family.

384
00:36:38,001 --> 00:36:41,140
That's the Kang Hyun Chae I knew.

385
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,670
Why are you suddenly bringing this up?

386
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,910
I'll cut to the chase. You need to leave her.

387
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,350
If you don't, you'll die.

388
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:01,461
You'll be killed in her place...

389
00:37:01,461 --> 00:37:03,790
by her alcoholic biological father.

390
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,431
Remember what I said.

391
00:37:09,401 --> 00:37:12,130
Break up with her. That's the only way you'll live.

392
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:29,780
Hello?

393
00:37:30,051 --> 00:37:32,890
I need to talk to you in person. I'll be at the studio apartment.

394
00:37:32,991 --> 00:37:34,220
Talk about what?

395
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:36,691
Is something going on?

396
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,130
I'll talk to you there.

397
00:37:52,411 --> 00:37:55,280
She was already dead when she was found.

398
00:37:57,681 --> 00:37:59,880
Why did you survive by yourself? Are you really Han Ae Ri?

399
00:38:02,251 --> 00:38:03,820
Put Han Ae Ri on the phone!

400
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,051
Mr. Kim?

401
00:38:05,851 --> 00:38:07,691
It was me who just went in there.

402
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,491
Why did you do that?

403
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,830
- Do what? - Trying to kill Hyun Chae.

404
00:38:49,301 --> 00:38:50,501
What's this nonsense?

405
00:38:50,501 --> 00:38:52,871
You tried to kill her and cover it up as an accident.

406
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:56,340
You've been looking for Han Ae Ri and her mom behind my back.

407
00:38:58,171 --> 00:39:00,640
Who's giving you these orders?

408
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:07,950
Chairman Yu Seo Il.

409
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:12,090
- What? - Hyun Chae provoked him first.

410
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,390
Do you know why Kim Jin Ho is unconscious?

411
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,020
Kang Hyun Chae, Kim Jin Ho,

412
00:39:16,291 --> 00:39:18,460
Kwak Song Ja, and Han Ae Ri will all die if they provoke him.

413
00:39:21,753 --> 00:39:23,953
How did they provoke him?

414
00:39:23,953 --> 00:39:25,594
What's it to you?

415
00:39:25,993 --> 00:39:27,193
Do you want to die as well?

416
00:39:28,993 --> 00:39:30,094
Darn it.

417
00:39:30,323 --> 00:39:32,234
Don't be stupid.

418
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,563
Hyun Chae never cared for you.

419
00:39:35,003 --> 00:39:36,933
She was going to leave without you.

(Name: Lee Ji Young, Name: Jung Yu Bin)

425
00:40:35,763 --> 00:40:37,864
Ji Ah, what are you looking for?

426
00:40:38,193 --> 00:40:39,693
My friend.

427
00:40:42,604 --> 00:40:44,404
I think I left it at home.

428
00:40:46,503 --> 00:40:48,774
Friend? What friend.

429
00:40:49,003 --> 00:40:51,544
It's my one and only friend.

430
00:40:52,243 --> 00:40:53,474
Do you want me to find it for you?

431
00:40:54,284 --> 00:40:55,443
Really?

432
00:41:02,753 --> 00:41:05,323
- I won't take long. - By yourself?

433
00:41:06,024 --> 00:41:07,823
Someone almost died there, yet you're going there alone?

434
00:41:08,623 --> 00:41:10,094
You're too fearless.

435
00:41:10,763 --> 00:41:11,893
What kind of toy is it?

436
00:41:12,234 --> 00:41:13,763
It must be her favourite toy.

437
00:41:14,404 --> 00:41:18,073
Everyone has something they rely on during hard times.

438
00:41:18,904 --> 00:41:21,974
She needs somewhere to rely on until her father wakes up.

439
00:41:22,503 --> 00:41:24,544
It's just like how I used to call my dad and leave voicemails...

440
00:41:24,643 --> 00:41:26,443
whenever things were tough.

441
00:41:27,143 --> 00:41:28,284
Where's the key?

442
00:41:28,813 --> 00:41:30,143
Ji Ah gave it to me.

443
00:41:55,003 --> 00:41:56,743
- I'll look here first. - Okay.

444
00:42:03,314 --> 00:42:04,484
Why?

445
00:42:05,513 --> 00:42:07,253
Why is Chairman Yu afraid when he has everything?

446
00:42:07,454 --> 00:42:08,753
What does Kim Jin Ho have?

447
00:42:13,594 --> 00:42:15,564
Something no one should watch or listen to.

448
00:42:29,873 --> 00:42:31,814
- Is it not there? - No.

449
00:42:45,554 --> 00:42:46,694
I found it.

450
00:42:49,324 --> 00:42:52,493

454
00:43:35,003 --> 00:43:36,003
Over there.

455
00:43:39,574 --> 00:43:40,574
Come in.

456
00:43:42,114 --> 00:43:44,454

That was two days before he was attacked.

469
00:44:21,423 --> 00:44:24,354

472
00:44:33,594 --> 00:44:35,704
Ms. Han, where is...

473
00:44:36,633 --> 00:44:37,773
What?

474
00:44:46,114 --> 00:44:47,273
Seo Do Kyun?

475
00:44:49,484 --> 00:44:51,854
- Where is it? - Where is what?

476
00:44:52,013 --> 00:44:53,584
Where is Kim Jin Ho's package?

477
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:57,153
I don't have it.

478
00:44:57,623 --> 00:44:59,554
Only he knows where it is.

479

Let me go.

480
00:45:06,393 --> 00:45:07,493
Where's the package?

481
00:45:08,263 --> 00:45:10,133
I told them that it had been retrieved already.

482
00:45:11,403 --> 00:45:12,804
What are you doing?

483
00:45:15,503 --> 00:45:16,743
Let's talk outside.

484
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,133
Look, Mr. Seo.

485
00:45:40,934 --> 00:45:43,304
You better explain yourself. What are you doing?

486
00:45:43,503 --> 00:45:44,704
I know...

487
00:45:46,574 --> 00:45:47,873
everything.

488
00:45:51,844 --> 00:45:53,214
I remembered them all.

489
00:45:55,543 --> 00:45:57,214
I know Hyun Chae died.

490
00:46:01,484 --> 00:46:02,484
Then...

491
00:46:03,354 --> 00:46:06,423
you must also know that we're not the enemies here.

492
00:46:08,094 --> 00:46:09,763
You'll remember everything in time,

493
00:46:09,923 --> 00:46:12,734
but Ms. Kang put herself in danger.

494
00:46:13,334 --> 00:46:16,064
She was the one who provoked and lied to Chairman Yu...

495
00:46:16,234 --> 00:46:17,503
about having something in her possession.

496
00:46:20,533 --> 00:46:21,704
So...

497
00:46:23,104 --> 00:46:26,574
will she be safe if she gets hold of that package?

498
00:46:26,643 --> 00:46:28,344
No, it's the opposite.

499
00:46:29,714 --> 00:46:32,913
Whoever knows about the package will be targeted by him.

500
00:46:36,484 --> 00:46:38,523
This is all I can tell you.

501
00:46:38,724 --> 00:46:39,824
Let's go.

502
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:56,344
(Please hear me out.)

503
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:27,003
Is your biological father an alcoholic?

504
00:47:29,373 --> 00:47:31,273
Is it true that you were adopted by a wealthy family?

505
00:47:37,184 --> 00:47:38,584
I don't understand.

506
00:47:39,454 --> 00:47:41,854
I never told anyone about this.

507
00:47:45,393 --> 00:47:46,724
How did you know?

508
00:47:46,993 --> 00:47:48,263
You need to leave her.

509
00:47:49,464 --> 00:47:51,094
If you don't, you'll die.

510
00:47:51,734 --> 00:47:54,533
You'll be killed in her place...

511
00:47:54,533 --> 00:47:58,734
by her alcoholic biological father.

512
00:48:02,204 --> 00:48:04,204
When did he find you again?

513
00:48:07,114 --> 00:48:08,684
Is he the reason...

514
00:48:10,643 --> 00:48:11,984
why we met again?

515
00:48:15,423 --> 00:48:17,354
When that scumbag came for me once again...

516
00:48:17,354 --> 00:48:19,393
and started threatening me,

517
00:48:22,194 --> 00:48:24,464
I felt like I was on the edge of a cliff.

518
00:48:27,864 --> 00:48:31,704
And every time that happened, you appeared in front of me.

519
00:48:34,844 --> 00:48:36,444
I told you...

520
00:48:37,143 --> 00:48:38,844
that I wanted to reset my life.

521
00:48:39,074 --> 00:48:41,143
I just need you and Da Bin.

522
00:48:41,513 --> 00:48:43,283
Hyun Chae never cared for you.

523
00:48:43,484 --> 00:48:45,383
She was going to leave without you.

524
00:48:45,484 --> 00:48:49,423
So let's get rid of Kim Seo Jin as we planned and get out of here.

525
00:48:49,623 --> 00:48:50,923
What would you do...

526
00:48:51,993 --> 00:48:53,423
if you could foresee the future,

527
00:48:58,893 --> 00:49:01,133
and the ending wasn't what you wanted?

528
00:49:06,334 --> 00:49:07,704
Would you make a different choice?

529
00:49:07,773 --> 00:49:09,643
You're not making any sense.

530
00:49:10,444 --> 00:49:12,444
Is there an issue with what we planned?

531
00:49:12,444 --> 00:49:14,074
Don't you regret your decision?

532
00:49:18,513 --> 00:49:19,614
I don't.

533
00:49:46,243 --> 00:49:49,143
These are what Kim Jin Ho had in his storage locker.

534
00:49:49,184 --> 00:49:52,584
He already took them out, so all I have are these photos.

(Han Ae Ri)

536
00:50:07,794 --> 00:50:10,203
Ms. Han, you did well.

537
00:50:10,433 --> 00:50:11,774
What now?

538
00:50:12,473 --> 00:50:16,004
There's no way to locate the files without Kim Jin Ho's help.

539
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:19,473
The police contacted me with the news.

540
00:50:21,844 --> 00:50:23,913
Lee Taek Gyu made bail.

541
00:50:25,153 --> 00:50:26,153
What?

542
00:50:26,784 --> 00:50:29,254
Park Joo Young goes to prison and Lee Taek Gyu comes out?

543
00:50:33,693 --> 00:50:35,893
Chairman Yu must have use for him.

544
00:50:38,193 --> 00:50:40,163
Something bad will happen soon.

545
00:50:43,203 --> 00:50:46,973
I think it's time to make the decision.

546
00:50:49,143 --> 00:50:51,443
The old evidence is long gone,

547
00:50:52,074 --> 00:50:55,514
so it's up to us to find new proof.

548
00:50:55,784 --> 00:50:56,883
Ms. Han.

549
00:50:58,614 --> 00:51:00,054
Listen to me carefully.

550
00:51:38,423 --> 00:51:39,494
Hello?

551
00:51:39,854 --> 00:51:41,963
Hello, Mr. Kim.

552
00:51:42,024 --> 00:51:43,524
Are you free to talk?

553
00:51:43,923 --> 00:51:45,564
Yes, I'm good.

554
00:51:46,233 --> 00:51:49,104
I just got off the phone with you from a month from now.

555
00:51:50,203 --> 00:51:52,933
He suggested this and I approved.

556
00:51:53,574 --> 00:51:54,703
Go ahead.

557
00:51:55,973 --> 00:51:57,903
There's no other choice now.

558
00:51:58,074 --> 00:51:59,973
This is the only move we have left.

559
00:52:02,044 --> 00:52:04,683
Please listen carefully to what I have to say.

560
00:52:05,614 --> 00:52:06,614
Tomorrow...

561
00:52:51,834 --> 00:52:52,994
You called, sir?

562
00:52:57,834 --> 00:52:59,403
Where were you this morning?

563
00:53:00,304 --> 00:53:02,104
I asked for you but you weren't in your office.

564
00:53:02,104 --> 00:53:03,504
I was at the police station.

565
00:53:04,574 --> 00:53:05,913
What for?

566
00:53:07,074 --> 00:53:08,143
Recently,

567
00:53:09,244 --> 00:53:12,114
I've been looking into my father's death.

568
00:53:13,213 --> 00:53:14,854
He didn't commit suicide...

569
00:53:15,854 --> 00:53:17,824
but was murdered by someone.

570
00:53:18,824 --> 00:53:20,723
The suspected killer...

571
00:53:21,054 --> 00:53:24,123
- was arrested for another case... - Your father was murdered?

572
00:53:24,794 --> 00:53:26,264
By whom and why?

573
00:53:30,304 --> 00:53:31,873
What do you remember...

574
00:53:32,903 --> 00:53:34,334
about the situation at the time?

575
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:36,373
What is it that you want to ask?

576
00:53:46,584 --> 00:53:47,983
This is unexpected.

577
00:54:00,433 --> 00:54:03,133
My father died while digging...

578
00:54:03,133 --> 00:54:05,304
into the real cause of the collapse.

579
00:54:06,673 --> 00:54:08,544
Those who wanted to cover it up...

580
00:54:09,344 --> 00:54:10,943
had my father murdered.

581
00:54:11,244 --> 00:54:13,673
I'm not at all surprised by your claims.

582
00:54:15,044 --> 00:54:17,683
You have no idea how much I've been slandered...

583
00:54:17,683 --> 00:54:18,953
for this incident.

584
00:54:20,213 --> 00:54:24,084
The collapse is what I will be guilty of forever.

585
00:54:24,584 --> 00:54:27,653
You of all people know what I've been living with...

586
00:54:28,024 --> 00:54:29,794
since the accident.

587
00:54:30,494 --> 00:54:33,233
I don't know what you've been told,

588
00:54:33,764 --> 00:54:35,004
but listen to me.

589
00:54:35,834 --> 00:54:39,274
Seo Jin, I don't want to lose you.

590
00:54:40,133 --> 00:54:42,903
What I want to know is the truth.

591
00:54:43,004 --> 00:54:44,873
What I say is the truth,

592
00:54:45,274 --> 00:54:47,114
and the path I take gets written in history.

593
00:54:48,614 --> 00:54:50,413
I'm running out of tolerance for your aberrant behaviour.

594
00:54:51,483 --> 00:54:53,153
If you get me, you may leave.

595
00:54:59,354 --> 00:55:00,693
(Han Ae Ri)

596
00:55:04,794 --> 00:55:06,994
You once told me that what you speak is the truth...

597
00:55:07,393 --> 00:55:08,733
and your actions get written in history.

598
00:55:09,304 --> 00:55:12,804
I thought we were done discussing this nonsense.

599
00:55:12,973 --> 00:55:15,774
The package you're after is in my possession.

600
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:18,044
And what am I after?

601
00:55:18,203 --> 00:55:20,514
The evidence that shows...

602
00:55:21,044 --> 00:55:23,383
how the Taejung Town collapse 19 years ago...

603
00:55:23,683 --> 00:55:26,514
wasn't an accident caused by miscalculation...

604
00:55:26,683 --> 00:55:28,423
but an intended crime on your part...

605
00:55:28,653 --> 00:55:30,453
where you set explosives to go off...

606
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:33,254
which ended in countless lives lost.

607
00:55:34,123 --> 00:55:36,594
The analysis report of the incident...

608
00:55:37,393 --> 00:55:39,794
and a recording of you confessing to the crime.

609
00:55:39,994 --> 00:55:41,094
Both of those...

610
00:55:42,403 --> 00:55:43,633
are in my possession.

611
00:55:45,973 --> 00:55:47,203
Then show me.

612
00:55:49,973 --> 00:55:52,744
Someone who has served me for so long...

613
00:55:53,774 --> 00:55:55,643
should know the basic rules of a deal.

614
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:57,514
To begin negotiations,

615
00:55:57,514 --> 00:56:00,084
what you're selling should be verified first.

616
00:56:00,953 --> 00:56:03,554
A girl named Han Ae Ri also claims to have it.

617
00:56:04,554 --> 00:56:06,653
Even your wife came to me...

618
00:56:06,923 --> 00:56:08,723
saying the same thing.

619
00:56:09,163 --> 00:56:12,594
However, none of them were in possession of the package.

620
00:56:12,864 --> 00:56:15,034
I'm sure it's the same with you as well.

621
00:56:15,034 --> 00:56:16,163
And how can it not be...

622
00:56:16,504 --> 00:56:19,433
when such a thing doesn't even exist?

623
00:56:21,844 --> 00:56:23,574
Anyway, I'll take this as your letter of resignation.

624
00:56:24,604 --> 00:56:26,014
Leave if you get me.

625
00:56:33,354 --> 00:56:36,254
(Han Ae Ri)

626
00:56:36,983 --> 00:56:38,693
Yes, Ms. Han.

627
00:56:38,953 --> 00:56:40,254
Do you have it?

628
00:56:42,123 --> 00:56:44,893
Of course. I'll be right there.

629
00:56:45,294 --> 00:56:46,663
What is the meaning of this?

630
00:56:46,663 --> 00:56:49,733
You don't have to say anything, sir.

631
00:56:50,604 --> 00:56:52,104
It's not like...

632
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:54,903
silence can change what's true anyway.

633
00:56:56,044 --> 00:56:58,413
I will make sure to pay you back...

634
00:56:58,413 --> 00:56:59,844
for whatever debt...

635
00:57:00,844 --> 00:57:02,344
we have between us.

636
00:57:31,673 --> 00:57:33,443
So where is this so-called evidence?

637
00:57:34,344 --> 00:57:36,544
What can you do with it anyway?

638
00:57:44,854 --> 00:57:48,223
(Taejung Town Collapse Root Cause Analysis Report)

639
00:57:48,223 --> 00:57:51,193
I will tell you when and where.

640
00:57:51,463 --> 00:57:53,264
There, you will hear my terms.

641
00:58:38,873 --> 00:58:39,943
I'm on my way...

642
00:58:41,443 --> 00:58:43,014
to meet Chairman Yu.

643
00:59:48,373 --> 00:59:51,643
Why did you want to meet at a place like this?

644
00:59:53,183 --> 00:59:54,953
Your eyesight fails with age,

645
00:59:56,054 --> 00:59:57,784
so it was difficult to climb up those stairs.

646
00:59:58,123 --> 01:00:00,824
This is where the celebration for the start of Taejung Project...

647
01:00:00,824 --> 01:00:02,264
will take place.

648
01:00:02,564 --> 01:00:05,264
I see. Is this the place?

649
01:00:05,733 --> 01:00:09,534
Blowing up and demolishing this abandoned building...

650
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:13,703
is going to be the highlight of that event.

651
01:00:13,804 --> 01:00:15,104
You picked the right building.

652
01:00:15,973 --> 01:00:17,774
On my way up here,

653
01:00:18,544 --> 01:00:20,443
I noticed how lousily this building was constructed.

654
01:00:21,614 --> 01:00:23,344
I wouldn't have built it like this.

655
01:00:24,183 --> 01:00:25,614
You sure are good at what you do.

656
01:00:26,153 --> 01:00:28,584
And whom do you think you should thank for that?

657
01:00:31,653 --> 01:00:33,094
On second thought, you're right.

658
01:00:34,254 --> 01:00:35,564
19 years ago,

659
01:00:37,123 --> 01:00:38,933
when the building collapsed on me,

660
01:00:40,334 --> 01:00:42,504
I was a naive, young boy.

661
01:00:43,364 --> 01:00:46,203
I thought everything on the news was the truth.

662
01:00:47,274 --> 01:00:48,574
But ironically,

663
01:00:49,004 --> 01:00:51,673
Yujung taught me everything I had to learn about constructions.

664
01:00:53,074 --> 01:00:54,213
That's how I knew...

665
01:00:55,683 --> 01:00:58,244
that it was impossible for a building to collapse...

666
01:00:58,314 --> 01:01:01,114
solely due to poor planning and construction.

667
01:01:03,483 --> 01:01:06,594
They say, you should never take in another human being.

668
01:01:07,294 --> 01:01:10,064
- What an ingrate. - Explosive demolition is...

669
01:01:13,663 --> 01:01:16,203
only for abandoned buildings like this that are vacant.

670
01:01:17,463 --> 01:01:18,534
How...

671
01:01:20,133 --> 01:01:21,233
How could you...

672
01:01:22,143 --> 01:01:24,104
deliberately blow up a building...

673
01:01:24,903 --> 01:01:26,344
that was full of people?

674
01:01:26,473 --> 01:01:28,844
Everyone's bound to die.

675
01:01:29,344 --> 01:01:30,943
I just helped them...

676
01:01:31,784 --> 01:01:34,213
not die in vain.

677
01:01:37,153 --> 01:01:40,994
That building may have collapsed that day, but Yujung rose.

678
01:01:41,054 --> 01:01:44,324
Compared to the number of lives lost at Taejung Town that day,

679
01:01:44,324 --> 01:01:47,133
countless more have been able...

680
01:01:47,963 --> 01:01:51,733
to make ends meet thanks to Yujung.

681
01:01:52,004 --> 01:01:53,534
And even more...

682
01:01:53,534 --> 01:01:56,304
have found safety in the houses we've built.

683
01:01:57,044 --> 01:02:00,314
The moment I feed those people...

684
01:02:00,314 --> 01:02:04,344
who accuse me of being immoral...

685
01:02:05,383 --> 01:02:07,453
is when I become their saviour.

686
01:02:07,983 --> 01:02:09,723
That's the way of the world.

687
01:02:32,213 --> 01:02:33,614
- I'm asking as a victim... - I'm asking as a victim...

688
01:02:33,614 --> 01:02:35,014
- of the Taejung Town Collapse. - of the Taejung Town Collapse.

689
01:02:37,143 --> 01:02:39,054
Did you intentionally blast...

690
01:02:39,413 --> 01:02:41,713
Taejung Town?

691
01:02:41,713 --> 01:02:45,554
Did you intentionally blast Taejung Town?

692
01:02:47,824 --> 01:02:50,163
Yes, I did.

693
01:02:50,663 --> 01:02:52,994
I blasted Taejung Town.

694
01:02:52,994 --> 01:02:55,933
Then you fabricated the numbers and the documents.

695
01:02:55,933 --> 01:02:57,064
You fabricated the situation.

696
01:02:57,064 --> 01:02:59,274
You blamed the collapse on Banyoung.

697
01:02:59,274 --> 01:03:01,074
You blamed the collapse on Banyoung.

698
01:03:01,074 --> 01:03:02,943
You're going to take over Banyoung during this crisis...

699
01:03:02,943 --> 01:03:04,074
to make Yujung greater?

700
01:03:04,074 --> 01:03:05,574
You took over Banyoung.

701
01:03:05,873 --> 01:03:08,274
What's so bad about that?

702
01:03:08,413 --> 01:03:10,913
Why is it a sin...

703
01:03:10,913 --> 01:03:14,883
for the strong to consume the weak and survive?

704
01:03:16,054 --> 01:03:17,284
Give it to me.

705
01:03:30,034 --> 01:03:31,403
Give me back what's mine.

706
01:03:33,034 --> 01:03:34,274
I don't have it.

707
01:03:35,504 --> 01:03:37,443
- What did you say? - I never had it.

708
01:03:38,104 --> 01:03:40,614
And everything you just said...

709
01:03:41,143 --> 01:03:42,413
has been recorded.

710
01:03:42,913 --> 01:03:44,844
This will be enough proof.

711
01:03:48,554 --> 01:03:50,824
You've done the exact same thing your father did.

712
01:03:51,183 --> 01:03:53,794
Then I'll kill you the exact same way as well.

713
01:04:26,693 --> 01:04:29,663
Ms. Han, please take care of it.

714
01:04:57,653 --> 01:05:00,354
(Kim Seo Jin)

715
01:07:42,784 --> 01:07:43,983
(Kairos)

716
01:07:43,983 --> 01:07:46,923
Mr. Kim and I from the future weren't always successful.

717
01:07:46,923 --> 01:07:49,724
Every time the present changed, the future did as well.

718
01:07:49,724 --> 01:07:52,534
I'll repeat everything I'll do a month from now on...

719
01:07:52,534 --> 01:07:53,664
to prevent any major changes.

720
01:07:53,664 --> 01:07:55,364
There can be no variables.

721
01:07:55,594 --> 01:07:58,733
I have one question. How was Hyun Chae after I died?

722
01:07:58,833 --> 01:08:01,003
Lee Taek Gyu was released today.

723
01:08:01,003 --> 01:08:03,503
