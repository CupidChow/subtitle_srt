=Episode 16=

3
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,640
(You really are the best
at planning surprises.)

4
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,720
(Oh no, I almost overslept!)

5
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:19,640
Hey, Shi Yue.

6
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,160
What's up, Mr. Lu Xingchen?

7
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,310
It's so early.
Can't you let me sleep a bit longer?

8
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,080
No way. I wasn't ready last time.

9
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,520
This time, I'll make it perfect.

10
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,750
Man, you're in love
and I'm the one suffering.

11
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,160
Get up. Come with me.

12
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,910
Yesterday,
when we played that card game,

13
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,000
I learned so much
about what she likes. Come on.

14
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,600
You're really treating me
like your chauffeur.

15
00:01:41,044 --> 00:01:42,740
We've confirmed six stores today.

16
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,030
Only four left for tomorrow.

17
00:01:44,044 --> 00:01:45,933
Feels like a huge weight
off my shoulders.

18
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,310
If you're free this afternoon,

19
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,550
we could visit one more place.

20
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,030
Mr. Xin's place is nearby.

21
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,440
Sorry, Mo Li.

22
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,180
I already promised Lu Xingchen
I'd spend the afternoon with him.

23
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,600
I told him this morning
that I was sleeping in.

24
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,520
Why lie about that?

25
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,030
He wouldn't let you work?

26
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,520
It's not about work.

27
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,360
But if I spend the day with you,
he might get the wrong idea.

28
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,110
Stop the car.

29
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,640
What? It's dangerous here.

30
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,710
Isn't that...

31
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,830
Don't interrupt.

32
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,180
(Ms. Su-perstar)

33
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,900
(Lu Xingchen)

34
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,550
Your hair's messy.

35
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,100
(Lu Xingchen)

36
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,360
I can do it myself.

37
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,150
It's cold. Keep yourself warm.

38
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,080
Gu Liusu.

39
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,480
Lu Xingchen? Shi Yue?

40
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,360
Just what I didn't want to happen.

41
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,420
(Hongkou 1920)

42
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,480
Why are you with him?

43
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,990
Weren't you supposed to be sleeping in?

44
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,480
Who would've thought?

45
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,150
A master of time management now?

46
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,590
No.

47
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,640
Is there something wrong with work?

48
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,790
You're from Xinghan, and she's from GL.

49
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,640
Is GL paying your salary now?

50
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,240
Or did you switch to GL?

51
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,990
Who are you to stop my girlfriend?

52
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:37,870
Come with me.

53
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,080
Wait, Lu Xingchen.

54
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:43,480
Mo Li, let me clear things up first.
I'll call you later.

55
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:43,870
Later...

56
00:03:44,222 --> 00:03:45,480
What is there to clear up?

57
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,960
Say it to him now.

58
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,222
Are you seeing him later or not?

59
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,800
Lu Xingchen, it's just work between us.

60
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,670
Work? What kind of work is that?

61
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,150
Is it easier to work
with someone who likes you?

62
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,520
What are you talking about?

63
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,640
You really don't know he likes you?

64
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,520
Have you even thought about how I feel?

65
00:04:13,288 --> 00:04:13,960
You're right.

66
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,550
I enjoy it when people like me.

67
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,830
I like working with them.

68
00:04:19,266 --> 00:04:20,830
That way, I don't have to do anything.

69
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,000
I don't have to try hard.

70
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,960
It really does make things easier.

71
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,200
Mo Li, I'll see you tomorrow.

72
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:41,710
Gu Liusu.

73
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,960
We're in a relationship, aren't we?

74
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,150
Do you really know what that means?

75
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,120
Lu Xingchen.

76
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,200
You don't actually think

77
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,120
you're more important
than my work, do you?

I wonder if the two of us

95
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,270
could ever be something more.

100
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,133
Guess being pretty
really makes life easier.

101
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,080
Doesn't Mr. Zhang like you too?

102
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:41,400
In my next life,
I want to be a beauty like you.

103

Is it that hard to admit
someone's good at what they do?

104
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,320
Just because I'm a woman,

105
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,200
you think my success

106
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,520
only comes from being young and pretty
and liked by others?

107
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,640
While yours comes
from talent and hard work.

108
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,760
Take a good look

109
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,440
at your lousy design.

You could see it in her eyes!

123
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,470
Come on, Xingchen.

124
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,710
Can you calm down for once?

125
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,960
What's gotten into you?

126
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,440
They were practically about to kiss.

127
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,390
Did they actually kiss?

128
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:57,910
I didn't see anything.

129
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,910
Even if you didn't see it...

130
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,760
Right in front of the guy who likes her,

131
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:12,030
she said that her work

132
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:16,790
mattered more than me.

133
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,680
She said that about me!

134
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,680
Me!

135
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,760
I'm the one
who's loved her the most all along.

136
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,440
Ms. Gu really is something.

137
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,960
She actually made you cry.

138
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,400
She'll regret it.

139
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,870
She'll come and make it up to me.

140
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,710
You okay?

141
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,560
Starting tomorrow,

142
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,320
I'll never speak to her again.

143
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:05,750
Never!

144
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,160
Morning.

145
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,960
Everyone, pause what you're working on.

146
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,160
I have an announcement to make.

147
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,710
I've decided that Starry Sea
will follow Secretary Lu's suggestion

148
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,560
and switch to eco-friendly materials.

149
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:34,110
Wait, does that mean I can become
a full-time employee now?

150
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,830
No more internship for me?

151
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,920
We're all part of one family now.

152
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,280
Let's work well together.

153
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,040
Xiaolu.

154
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,280
Help Secretary Lu
with his resignation paperwork.

155
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,750
The desk was cleared
by the time you ordered.

156
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,080
Wait a minute.

157
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,080
What do you mean by that?

158
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,990
You came here
because of the Starry Sea project.

159
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,440
Now that it's wrapped up,

160
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,755
it's only right that you leave.

161
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,200
Gu Liusu, this is a personal vendetta.

162
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,710
Personal? Between us?

163
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,750
Fine.

164
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,920
I admit I said
something stupid that day.

165
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,110
I'm sorry.

166
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,400
I apologize to you.

167
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:23,590
Lu Xingchen.

168
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,680
Every word I just said

169
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,800
was something I thought about carefully.

170
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,560
I don't have time to play games

171
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,960
with a kid like you.

172
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,160
Games?

173
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,960
You think my feelings for you,

174
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,750
that I love you,

175
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,440
because it's a game?

176
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,510
Have you ever loved me?

177
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,400
I had feelings for you.

178
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,510
But it's not love.

179
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,560
Gu Liusu, you don't have love in you.

180
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,040
You just need someone
who comes when you call

181
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,350
and leaves when you say so.

182
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,750
That's right. I don't need love.

183
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,160
Love is selfish.

184
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,040
It's possessive.

185
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,230
I can't stand the ugly side

186
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,320
of the so-called love.

187
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,440
So let's just go back
to living our own lives.

188
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,960
Fine. Don't regret it.

189
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,510
Thanks for making a scene at the office.

190
00:11:25,866 --> 00:11:27,200
But it doesn't matter anymore.

191
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,990
Wow, Secretary Lu's got guts.

192
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,350
He's too immature for Ms. Gu, though.

193
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,630
Sometimes the childish ones are
the most genuine.

194
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,133
Stop gossiping. Get back to work.

195
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,040
Ms. Gu, these are
the eco-material samples you mentioned.

196
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,320
I found a few different options
for you to look at.

197
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,440
Actually, I've already decided.

198
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,870
I plan to reuse shell casings
from war zones as raw material.

199
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,920
Shell casings from war zones?

200
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,080
Starry Sea had a bad run
with public opinion before.

201
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,110
I want to make things right

202
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,200
through this charity gala.

203
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,470
In that case,

204
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:41,510
people might accuse you
of using charity for publicity.

205
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,870
We can't stop people from talking.

206
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,830
All we can do is follow
what we believe in.

207
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,750
I agree. Let's do it your way.

208
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,920
Let's get ready for Friday's auction.

209
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,920
(Going back to our own paths)

210
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,470
(might be the best for us both.)

211
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,280
(Work? What kind of work is that?)

212
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,080
(Is it easier to work
with someone who likes you?)

213
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:37,280
(Lu Xingchen,
sometimes you speak without thinking.)

214
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,680
(So what will you do now
to make her forgive you?)
