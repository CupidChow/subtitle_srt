3
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,720
I don't think
there's anything to worry about.

4
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,520
Liusu is smart.

5
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,550
Maybe she'll be back any minute now.

6
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,190
Su never turns off her phone.

7
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,110
Her phone battery
never drops below fifty percent.

8
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,080
Where could she have gone?

9
00:01:31,222 --> 00:01:33,555
Don't worry,
the police are already looking for her.

10
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,310
No way, I'll go look for her too.

11
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,310
Mo Li, where are you going?

12
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,288
I'm going to find her.

13
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,550
You're awake.

14
00:02:33,577 --> 00:02:36,377
Do you have anything to do
with what happened to the Lu family?

15
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,670
Well, you know so much.

16
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,270
What good does it do for you?

17
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,710
Are you out of your mind?

18
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:42,960
What you're doing is illegal!

19
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,390
You'll go to jail for this!

20
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,270
Stay still!

21
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,520
Help. Help!

22
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,760
Help! He...

23
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,590
Is anyone there?

24
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,480
I'll give you a surprise later.

25
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,870
Guess who's coming to your rescue?

26
00:03:06,155 --> 00:03:07,760
Mo Li said he went to look for her.

27
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,270
Where could that be?

28
00:03:09,577 --> 00:03:11,830
I met with those relocated residents
this afternoon.

29
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,977
(Illegal Demolition, Give Back Homes)
Get out of the car! Get out!

30
00:03:13,977 --> 00:03:14,888
You, get out!

31
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,133
Actually, I think
Mr. Xingchen's plan is feasible.

32
00:03:19,111 --> 00:03:20,550
The company is without a leader.

33
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,550
Mr. Xingchen, I need to leave now.

34
00:03:23,777 --> 00:03:25,640
I have to deal
with the company matters first.

35
00:03:27,244 --> 00:03:28,600
No... Something's off.

36
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,550
(Baozhu, wait for us at home.)

37
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,240
(Shi Yue, keep an eye on your phone.
Notify the police if there's any news.)

38
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,670
Starting today,
we're all in the same boat,

39
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,590
Mr. Mo.

40
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,110
You idiot.

41
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,870
I told you
to keep your hands off Gu Liusu!

42
00:04:00,244 --> 00:04:02,400
Where exactly
are Mr. Lin's wife and child?

43
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,040
You've pushed your luck!

44
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:21,320
Who do you think you are to question me?

45
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,760
Who do you think you are?

46
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,080
Stop it!

47
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,880
Please spare me!

48
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,790
Stop it!

49
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,000
Gu Liusu!

50
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,440
Gu Liusu!

51
00:04:54,222 --> 00:04:55,200
Gu Liusu!

52
00:04:55,888 --> 00:04:57,266
Gu Liusu!

53
00:05:05,444 --> 00:05:07,022
Are you okay?

54
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,030
Mo Li.

55
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:14,790
Call the police.

56
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:15,390
Hurry.

57
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,044
No, we should go to the hospital first.

58
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,520
Your head's bleeding.

59
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,030
Let me untie you first.

60
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:20,910
Call the police.

61
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:21,710
Are you alright?

62
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:23,555
It was all Lin Xiang and his men...

63
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,470
Gu Nian.

64
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,910
Gu Nian?

65
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,440
Do you still remember me?

66
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,520
You're my Gu Nian.

67
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,080
How do you know I'm Gu Nian?

68
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,270
You're my Gu Nian!

69
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,320
Mo Li, what are you talking about?

70
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,440
- I've missed you so much, Gu Nian!
- Mo Li!

71
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,150
Mo Li, what are you talking about?

72
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,710
Mo Li, you're scaring me.

73
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,710
You're mine.

74
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,790
You'll always be mine!

75
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,120
Gu Liusu!

76
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,470
Gu Liusu!

77
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,270
Lu Xingchen!

78
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:53,910
Liusu!

79
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,150
Lu Xingchen!

80
00:05:57,244 --> 00:05:58,150
Mo Li is the one...

81
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,000
Lu Xingchen!

82
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,830
Get out of here!

83
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,790
Go away!

84
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,220
Mo Li.

85
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,440
Mo Li...

86
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,960
She's my Gu Nian,

87
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,080
not your Gu Liusu!

88
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,830
Don't touch her.

89
00:06:15,111 --> 00:06:16,350
Mo Li, have you lost your mind?

90
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:16,960
Mo Li!

91
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,830
Only I

92
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,350
can save her.

93
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:25,830
Mo Li...

94
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,560
Mo Li.

95
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,440
What do you want?

96
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,200
Money?

97
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,150
Company shares?

98
00:06:35,244 --> 00:06:36,440
I'll give it all to you.

99
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,150
Whatever you want, you can have it.

100
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,680
Let Gu Liusu go first.

101
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,866
Put the knife down, okay?

102
00:06:40,888 --> 00:06:42,030
I want love!

103
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,470
I want a family.

104
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,520
I want them to respect me.

105
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,880
I want my mom's love.

106
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,830
I want Mr. Lu's love.

107
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:08,828
Li.

108
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,910
Study hard.

109
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,760
When you grow up,

110
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,080
come and find me.

111
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:13,760
(Deal?)

112
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,830
I want your love too.

113
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,350
Do you love me?

114
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,710
Mo Li, you've gone insane.

115
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,080
Mo Li...

116
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,390
We're back to our childhood.

117
00:07:43,711 --> 00:07:44,466
Mo Li.

118
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:45,866
Whatever you want, I'll give you.

119
00:07:45,977 --> 00:07:47,879
Just put the knife down, okay?

120
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,320
What gives?

121
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,960
Why do you always get everything
I ever wanted so easily?

122
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,030
Mo Li, calm down.

123
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:58,320
Calm down? How can I calm down?

124
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,350
Why do you always have to show off?

125
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,230
Do you really love Gu Liusu?

126
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,230
You're just hurting her!

127
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,590
Oh, right.

128
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,520
Gu Nian, don't be afraid.

129
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,470
I'll untie you first.

130
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,560
All of you, just die!

131
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,830
Lu Xingchen...

132
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,320
Lu Xingchen...

133
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,200
Lu Xingchen!

134
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,800
I'm here.

135
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,440
It's okay.

136
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,990
Don't be afraid.

137
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,830
Mo Li.

138
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:56,230
Mo Li, untie me, okay? Hurry.

139
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,350
Help me out.

140
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,350
Help me out.

141
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:07,510
Mo Li, untie me already.
He can't hold on much longer!

142
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,470
Lu Xingchen!

143
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,888
Lu Xingchen...

144
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,630
Mo Li.

145
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,680
Mo Li.

146
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,710
Mo Li, what are you doing?

147
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,870
Mo Li, what are you doing? Mo Li!

148
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,400
Mo Li!

149
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,160
I want you to watch him

150
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,990
die right in front of you.

151
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,280
Don't hurt him! Please, I'm begging you!

152
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,230
I'm begging you! Don't...

153
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,160
No!

154
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,560
Lu Xingchen!

155
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,990
Stop it!

156
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,200
Stop it, Mo Li!

157
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,080
I'm begging you!

158
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,560
Stop it, Mo Li!

159
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,590
If you've got a problem,
just come to me!

160
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,470
Let go! Just let go!

161
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,510
I'm fine.

162
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,400
Lu Xingchen, get out of here!

163
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,280
My father is gone. I can't lose you too!

164
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,400
Go! Please, I'm begging you!

165
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,870
Just let go!

166
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,560
Please, I'm begging you! Let go!

00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,710

168
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,870

172
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,590
heard you say you love me.

173
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,230
I love you.

174
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,160
I love you.

175
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,630
I said I love you,

177
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,400
