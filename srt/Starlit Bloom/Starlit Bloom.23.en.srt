3
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:06,460
(Mrs. Lin)

4
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:08,750
Hello, Mrs. Lin.

5
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,520
It's you, Mo Li.

6
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,110
Have you had fun abroad?

7
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,550
Thank you, Mo Li.

8
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,080
Everything was well arranged!

9
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,190
My son has been thrilled.

10
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,960
If you need anything, just let me know.

11
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,830
Honey.

12
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:28,800
Why...

13
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,550
Why are you abroad?

14
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,080
Be...

15
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,110
Be careful, okay?

16
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:38,520
Don't trust strangers so easily!

17
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,550
Mo Li has seen to everything,

18
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,390
so stop nagging. I'm hanging up.

19
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,390
You are truly wicked

20
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,910
and stupid.

21
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,240
I...

22
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,750
If you were a good lapdog,

23
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,030
I'd make your life easier.

24
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,600
But if you don't know
what's good for you...

25
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,110
So what if you've got the recording?

26
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,990
Are you going to report me
for running over Lu Jianhua?

27
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,390
I...

28
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,360
I was just joking.

29
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,520
I've got nothing to lose anyway.

30
00:02:27,177 --> 00:02:29,150
You think I'd be scared
of you ratting me out?

31
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,390
Worst case, we both go down together.

32
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,200
Just kidding.

33
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,550
Mr. Lin.

34
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,830
That's the fun part of the game.

35
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,360
Is it fun?

36
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,110
No, it's not...

37
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,360
No?

38
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,110
I'm done.

39
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,240
How about one more round?

40
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,360
No, I'm done...

41
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,480
Have one more drink.

42
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,670
No thanks...

43
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,710
I need to use the washroom.

44
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,040
Xiang.

45
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,080
He's a lunatic.

46
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,960
Send someone

47
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,590
to find my wife and kid.

48
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,480
Don't worry, Xiang.

49
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,760
As for the final move...

50
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,200
I want you

51
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,550
to figure out

52
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,670
his weak spot.

53
00:04:08,177 --> 00:04:10,110
(Since you've decided
to return to Xinghan,)

54
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,150
(bear this in mind.)

55
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,080
(You don't have to become
the perfect leader right away,)

56
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,990
(but you must let everyone know)

57
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,030
(that you returned to Xinghan)

58
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,560
(not because your last name is Lu.)

59
00:04:19,688 --> 00:04:21,680
(It's because you dare
to take responsibility)

60
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,120
(and face the storm head-on.)

61
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,790
If we pay them now,
they'll just ask for more!

62
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,200
What should we do, then?

63
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,030
Human greed has no bottom line.

64
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,790
What matters more? Money or lives?

65
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:46,466
Distribute the compensation funds
at once.

66
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,910
Calm everyone down.

67
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,470
(Demolition Compensation Agreement)
You make it sound so easy.

68
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,470
You pay one family and the rest
will come and ask for it.

69
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,520
We've followed
all the laws and regulations.

70
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,710
Why should we compensate them?

71
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,470
Laws and regulations, huh?

72
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:05,710
If that's the case,

73
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,270
then how do you explain these photos?

74
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,390
Who took them?

75
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,710
Could someone
be trying to frame Xinghan?

76
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,440
Yeah.

77
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,270
Who on earth took them?

78
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,640
Our priority now is

79
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,777
to minimize the impact
of these photos on Xinghan.

80
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:37,710
Everyone.

81
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,830
I call you all seniors

82
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,080
out of respect.

83
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,590
But don't you forget

84
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,520
who's the largest shareholder
of Xinghan.

85
00:05:56,488 --> 00:05:58,622
Issue the compensation funds
immediately.

86
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,880
Any objections to that?

87
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,830
Also,

88
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,390
establish an investigation team

89
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,760
and look into the demolition incident
thoroughly.

90
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:13,520
And...

91
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,440
If

92
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,350
I find out

93
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,470
that any of you here
were involved in this,

94
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,030
I'll settle scores with you.

95
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,640
Meeting adjourned.

96
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,790
Mr. Xingchen
has no management experience.

97
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,577
Judging from our financial report,

98
00:06:42,688 --> 00:06:44,320
his plan is not feasible.

99
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,080
But he was very emotional just now.

100
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:48,150
If we don't execute it,
he won't let it go.

101
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,390
For the company's sake,

102
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,711
we'll have to do him wrong.

103
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,200
But he has a point.

104
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,222
We should come up
with a compensation plan

105
00:06:55,222 --> 00:06:57,111
to comfort the relocated residents.

106
00:06:57,133 --> 00:06:58,511
Where do we get the money for that?

107
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,880
The company's stock
has already dropped by 30%.

108
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,910
If we pay them,
what about the new project?

109
00:07:04,444 --> 00:07:06,622
Mr. Mo has been
serving this company for years.

110
00:07:06,622 --> 00:07:08,466
(Xinghan Group)
So we should follow his lead.

111
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:18,790
Ms. Gu, the PR plan
I made for Xinghan got rejected.

112
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,200
I don't know the exact reason.

113
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,760
Hello, is everything going smoothly?

114
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,080
It's kind of strange. The execution
has been really slow.

115
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,640
You just took the position.
The staff probably needs time to adjust.

116
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,910
Yes.

117
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,960
I'll make a feast for you and Baozhu
tomorrow after work.

118
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,320
Sure. I'm heading
to the construction site.

119
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,030
I miss you so much.

120
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,470
(Me too.)

121
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,710
(By the way,
don't forget what I told you.)

122
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:55,440
(Yeah, I'll bear that in mind.)

123
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,320
Folks!

124
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,790
The heartless corporation is here!

125
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,390
(Illegal Demolition, Give Back Homes)
Guys, come out and shout the slogans!

126
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:01,960
Quick!

127
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,177
- We want our money back!
- We want our money back!

128
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,320
- We want our money back!
- We want our money back!

129
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,120
Surround them!

130
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:12,520
(Also, when one is influenced
by the behavior of a crowd,)

131
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,350
(it can affect their perception,
judgment, and awareness,)

132
00:08:15,377 --> 00:08:18,044
(Forced Demolition Is Against The Law)
(leading them to act like the majority.)

133
00:08:18,044 --> 00:08:20,080
(This is what's known
as herd mentality.)

134
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:23,830
Mo Li.

135
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,080
You get out first.

136
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:27,880
Alright.

137
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,733
I'll go down first.

138
00:08:28,733 --> 00:08:29,320
Come out!

139
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:29,960
Heartless corporation!

140
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,680
- Get out of your car!
- Get out!

141
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,990
Heartless corporation!

142
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,280
Violent demolition!

143
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,160
Calm down.

144
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,044
Heartless corporation!

145
00:08:37,044 --> 00:08:38,280
Everyone, calm down!

146
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,230
Violent demolition!

147
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,680
Give us back our homes!

148
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,510
This is not going to solve the problem.

149
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,440
It's no use talking about that now.

150
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,920
If you don't pay us today,

151
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,230
none of you are leaving!

152
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,040
Heartless corporation!

153
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,110
Everyone, calm down first.

154
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,200
We're resolving the issue.

155
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,160
Give us back our homes!

156
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,350
(If you want to break them down,)

157
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,960
(you must avoid the leader)

158
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:01,990
(and find the weak one.)

159
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,320
I've found one.

160
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,470
Sir, even though my dad is gone,

161
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:19,200
please believe me,
I won't let this project fail.

162
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,630
If you push the Lu family into a corner,

163
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,590
you'll lose your money,

164
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,911
and no one will build your houses.

165
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,830
Right?

166
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,280
What if we believe you now,

167
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,960
but you're just making empty promises?

168
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,280
You said “what if,” didn't you?

169
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,200
Alright.

170
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,800
Let's say it's a “what if.”

171
00:09:33,288 --> 00:09:34,350
But if you really think

172
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,230
I'm just making false promises,

173
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,711
then I'll sign contracts

174
00:09:37,755 --> 00:09:39,800
with you
and all the villagers out there.

175
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,230
I'll use my fixed assets
as collateral first.

176
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,750
Sir, I just need
a little time right now.

177
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,080
This really was an accident.

178
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,960
On behalf of Xinghan,

179
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,350
I'd like to apologize again.

180
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,630
I'm sorry.

181
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,230
Then let me talk it over with my wife.

182
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,200
Sure.

183
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,320
Sure, sir.

184
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,830
How about this?

185
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,710
Could you give me your contact?

186
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,350
Did I hear that right?

187
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,920
Mr. Lu from Xinghan
wants to add me on WeChat?

188
00:10:06,177 --> 00:10:08,400
I would only get
an assistant's number back then.

189
00:10:10,888 --> 00:10:12,230
We're all just ordinary people.

190
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,510
I understand

191
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,160
losing your home must be hard.

192
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,630
Please give me some time.

193
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:19,920
I'm sorry.

194
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,800
Oh, right.

195
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,400
(Welcome to
the Starry Sea product launch!)

196
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,280
(Starry Sea Press Conference)
Let's welcome Starry Sea's designer,

197
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,400
Ms. Gu Liusu.

198
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,470
Hello, everyone.

199
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,590
I'm Gu Liusu, founder of GL.

200
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,920
Our biggest innovation this time
is the material.

201
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:52,960
Actually, we're not living
in an era of peace.

202
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,560
In fact, ours is a peaceful country.

203
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,440
At this very moment,
somewhere in the world,

204
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,350
someone might be suffering
because of war.

205
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:04,280
Thus, we've taken shell casings
from war zones,

206
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,830
recycled and reused them.

207
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,800
We reprocess the shell casings

208
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,320
and create NFTs from them,

209
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,680
recorded on the blockchain,

210
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:13,590
solving the issue of easy duplication
and unclear copyright.

211
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,920
Buyers can also own unique collectibles.

212
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,160
Ms. Gu, GL used to work with diamonds.

213
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,440
What made you
change materials this time?

214
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,560
Mr. Xingchen,
here's Group Five's performance report.

215
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,510
Please take a look.

216
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:32,440
Is that the group that often
complains about slow approvals?

217
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,280
Well...

218
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,200
Alright, we'll grant
those capable colleagues more authority.

219
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,230
Understood.

220
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,590
I've reviewed the report.

221
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:49,160
Your team's performance
grew by 70% compared to last year.

222
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,590
But I've also heard complaints

223
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,800
that too many approval layers
slow things down,

224
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,680
causing some projects
to fail mid-process.

225
00:12:01,222 --> 00:12:02,500
In the second half of the year,

226
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,400
I'll grant you a privilege.

227
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,800
For deals under five million,

228
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,870
your team can approve them internally.

229
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,630
For those who try to copy our work,

230
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,680
you can imitate the look of our pieces,

231
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,960
but you can't replicate
the sound of metal crying.

232
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,080
More importantly,

233
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,080
our work carries weight.

234
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,230
It's not just physical weight.

235
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,710
But there's also the weight
of our hope for peace and love.

236
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,800
You all

237
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,920
deserve it!

238
00:12:32,444 --> 00:12:34,844
- Thank you, Mr. Xingchen!
- Thank you, Mr. Xingchen!

239
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,440
Mr. Xingchen seems like
a whole new person.

240
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,133
Don't call him Mr. Xingchen.
It's Mr. Lu.

241
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,440
(It's about time
to head home for dinner.)

242
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,440
Hello, Baozhu.

243
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:47,320
I'm coming to pick you up
for dinner at my place.

244
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,710
You go ahead.
I don't feel like going out.

245
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,400
I've seen to it all.
Keep GL's operating funds.

246
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,560
The rest will be transferred
to Xinghan's account.

247
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,750
I won't allow you to drown in sadness.

248
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,400
Wait for me. I'm coming now.

249
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,080
Sure.

251
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,200
