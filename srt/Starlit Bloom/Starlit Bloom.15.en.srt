Why do you always
have to take control of everything?

7
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,310
I just want to live my own life,

8
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,640
without anyone trying to control me.

9
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,670
Having a dad who cares for you

10
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,190
is a good thing, isn't it?

11
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,800
This child

12
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,440
deserves some pity.

13
00:01:41,444 --> 00:01:43,160
He lost his family at such a young age.

14
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,640
Officer,

15
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,640
I'd like to sponsor his studies abroad.

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,030

22
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,390
come find me,

23
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,240
okay?

24
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,360
Officer,

25
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,000
please have the orphanage
look after him for a few days.

26
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,320
I'll arrange for his paperwork.

27
00:02:20,244 --> 00:02:22,370
Let's toast to our first date.

28
00:02:22,377 --> 00:02:22,933

33
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,990
My girlfriend's beautiful, right?

34
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,270
She is.

35
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,360
Don't drink too much.

36
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,800
It's fine.

37
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,760
I brought something fun today.

38
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,200
A bit of liquor helps.

39
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,040
It makes it easier to open up.

40
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,430
What did you bring?

41
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,360
A card game.

42
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,270
Just a few simple questions...

43
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,150
So we can get to know each other better.

44
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,040
You don't bring girls here
all the time, do you?

45
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,520
Give me a break, Gu Liusu.

46
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,800
Ask Du if you don't trust me.

70
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,960

00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,390
Crying doesn't solve anything.

83
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,710
So why should I cry?

00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,270

So, what made you cry?

86
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,710
My family had an arranged marriage.

87
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,639
My mom didn't love my dad...

88
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,022
(And she didn't love me either.)

89
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:18,320
(But they always acted like
the perfect couple.)

90
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,710
One day, when I came home,

91
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:25,230
I saw that all my mom's clothes
and shoes were gone.

92
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,960
That was when I knew they'd divorced.

93
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,120
After that,
my dad threw himself into work.

94
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,640
He sent me abroad to study,

95
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,320

00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,560

101

I ever felt protected by someone.)

came by this morning when you were away.

that we need to put together
a list for the auction,

by the charity sponsors.

180

Why didn't you say so earlier?

181
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,160
Because you and Secretary Lu
were out on business this morning.

182
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,040
So we figured
we'd better not interrupt you.

183
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,710

184

185
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,110

getting too full of themselves.)

188
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,500
(Gu Liusu.)

189
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,280
Hey, Liusu.

190
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,960
Hey, Mo Li.

191
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:35,400
I heard from Xiaolu
that you were looking for me.

192
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,160
Yeah. Since this is a charity auction,

193
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,350
everyone's just donating items from home

194
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,560
to be part of it.

195
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,440
Tomorrow is Saturday,

196
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,560
so no one's working.

197
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,400
I thought I'd go check
and confirm the items.

198
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,110
I don't think

199
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,110
I'll have time this week.

200
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,440
It's okay. I'll go by myself.

201
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,280
The auction will happen
next Friday anyway.

202
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:05,040
And since GL Group
is one of the organizers,

203
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,320
I already feel bad for troubling you.

204
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,320
But Xiaolu and the others
don't know the clients that well.

205
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,510
How about this?

206
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,750
We split the visits into two days.

207
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,400
Saturday and Sunday mornings.

208
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,630
I should still have some time
in the mornings.

209
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:19,960
That works.

210
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,960
I'll reach out to the donors then.

211
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,680
Okay. Thanks for handling this.

212
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,740
