3
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,280
Excuse me, is the auction
on the second floor?

4
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,240
Yes. This way, please.

5
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,030
Thank you.

6
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,800
Lu Xingchen sure knows how to slack off.

7
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,911
We've been busy all day
and haven't seen him at all.

8
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:12,239
Shut up.

9
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,080
Don't you know
they've been fighting lately?

10
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,670
Ms. Gu isn't in a good mood these days.

11
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:16,830
- Behave.
- Okay.

12
00:01:16,888 --> 00:01:19,488
I heard they had a huge fight
the day I went on a business trip.

13
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,670
That's enough.

14
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,360
Are you gossiping during work hours?

15
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,160
Ms. Gu.

16
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,360
I told you to stop.

17
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,720
You were so loud.

18
00:01:40,044 --> 00:01:41,160
How's the preparation going?

19
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,080
Almost done.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,310
Why is Lin Xiang here?

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,470
Mr. Xingchen invited him over
under Xinghan's name.

22
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,750
Hello, Ms. Gu.

23
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,080
How have you been, Mr. Lin?

24
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,270
What a nice auction you've organized.

25
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,470
Welcome. Please come in.

26
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:06,600
Who knows she really means that.

27
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,240
Are you okay?

28
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,710
Yes, I'm good.

29
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,550
Let's go. It's about to start.

30
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:18,920
Sure.

31
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,670
Distinguished guests,

32
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,270
(Starlight Charity Auction)
welcome to the GL charity auction.

33
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,200
Let's first invite our organizer,
Ms. Gu Liusu,

34
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,390
to give a speech.

35
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,990
A round of applause, please.

36
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,520
Hello, everyone. I'm Gu Liusu.

37
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,760
Thank you all for taking time out

38
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,670
of your busy schedules to join us.

39
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,520
The reason this auction is held

40
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,670
is that I myself grew up
in an orphanage.

41
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,110
I hope that through this event,

42
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,711
we can raise more funds
for the orphanage

43
00:02:53,777 --> 00:02:56,270
to improve the children's
living and educational conditions

44
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,520
to the greatest extent possible.

45
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,390
Before the auction starts,

46
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,360
I'd like to make an announcement.

47
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,590
Starry Sea will be rebranded
as the Ruin Revival series.

48
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,360
Also, we'll recycle shell casings
from war zones

49
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,320
to replace metal ornaments from before.

50
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,430
Ostentatious.

51
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,390
Twenty percent of the proceeds
will be donated to charity.

52
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,040
- That's good.
- Great.

53
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,110
Right.

54
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,430
Thank you so much.

55
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,480

Bidder 10, 250,000.

66
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,800
You failed to drug Gu Liusu

67
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:51,040
and smeared GL too.

68
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,760
If you fail this time as well,

69
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,240
you can jog on.

70
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:58,990

Xinghan's item costs,

77
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,200
you must get it.

78
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,830
Why?

79
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,870
The Lu family invited us here.

80
00:04:17,888 --> 00:04:19,511
What do you think that means?

81
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,270
Bidder 3, 280,000.

82
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,880
Those two must've broken up.

83
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,230
We should take this chance

84
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:32,466
to get on Xinghan's good side.

85
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,080

Ladies, let's go check it out.

98
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,960
You stay here and enjoy the drama.

99
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,200
I'm heading off.

100
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,000
What's going on?

101
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
- Ms. Gu, would you explain this photo?
- Xiaolu, close it.

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,400
Are you two dating? Is your whole
strong-woman thing just a persona?

103
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,560
Is GL going bankrupt?

104
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,470
What's going on?

105
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,230
Something's wrong.

106
00:05:28,466 --> 00:05:29,640
Why can't I click anything?

107
00:05:29,888 --> 00:05:31,880
Ms. Gu, did you seduce your way up
to Mr. Xingchen?

108
00:05:31,888 --> 00:05:32,150
No.

109
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,800
You won over a rich heir
who's nine years younger.

110
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,950
Do you have any tips on seduction?

111
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,910
It's not like that.

112
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,780
Back up, please. Back up.
Stop taking photos!

113
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,710
It's not true.

114
00:05:39,044 --> 00:05:40,422
I was the one who seduced her.

115
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,640
Enough.

116
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,560
If you have any questions, ask me.

117
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,177
Don't make things hard for Gu Liusu.

118
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,390
I was the one
who approached her on purpose.

119
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,270
If you want to know

120
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:00,270
seduction tricks,

121
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,790
I'll share everything

122
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,640
I know.

123
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,230
Reporters,

124
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,320
please calm down.

125
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,520
Gu Liusu.

126
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:12,180
- Mr. Xingchen.
- Mr. Xingchen.

127
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,790
As for our relationship,

128
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,470
I'm pursuing Ms. Gu.

129
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,440
I see.

130
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,520
Alright.

131
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,590
Let's turn our focus back

132
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,520
to the charity auction.

133
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,680
Next up

134
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,270
is Xinghan's donation.

135
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,200
Bring it in.

136
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,900
- I'd like to see what it is.
- I'll take a look.

137
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,222
Xinghan must've donated
something valuable.

138
00:06:46,355 --> 00:06:47,760
You won't know. Let's see.

139
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,560
Let's unveil it.

140
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,270
This is...

141
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,266
Isn't this a diamond candy?

142
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,790
What's Lu Xingchen doing?

143
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,270
Who'd bid on a diamond candy?

144
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:00,910
Take photos. Quick.

145
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,644
This'll be tomorrow's headline.

146
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,520
Ms. Gu.

147
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,030
It's a diamond candy.

148
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,000
Diamond candy?

149
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,790
Is he hyping it up?

150
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,080
The kind you buy for a few yuan
at a general store.

151
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,520
Lu Xingchen,

152
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,270
do you even know what you're doing?

153
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,440
Trust me.

154
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,440
Hello, Mo Li?

155
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,560
Can we invite Lin Xiang
under Xinghan's name tomorrow?

156
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,560
Didn't you object to that before?

157
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,880
Don't ask. Just do it.

158
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,960
I have my plans.

159
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,120
Alright.

160
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,000
Good.

161
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:39,960
The starting price is

162
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,520
one million.

163
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,390
- One million?
- What?

164
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:49,080
Is he out of his mind?
One million for a candy?

165
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,000
Anyone wants to bid?

166
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,320
Who could afford that?

167
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,230
No one's bidding.

168
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:06,590
No matter how much

169
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,830
Xinghan's item costs,

170
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,590
you must get it.

171
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,470
Xinyi Group.

172
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,440
One million.

173
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,910
Xinyi bid for it. What a fool.

174
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,270
Let's go.

175
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,880
Please accept our interview.

176
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,680
(He invited Xinyi and brought a candy.)

177
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,760
(Is this payback for me?)

178
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,910
Any higher bids?

179
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,030
One million once.

180
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,230
One million twice.

181
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,870
One million three times. Sold.

182
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,680
This is going to cause trouble.

183
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,960
But a voluntary donation
doesn't break any rules.

184
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,110
Wrap up everything for today.

185
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,830

00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,920
I hope you'll write positively

187
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,710
in your reports.

188
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,920
Also, many thanks to Ms. Gu
for organizing this auction

189
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,560
and giving us charity people a chance.

190
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,236
(Xinghan's Heir Lu Xingchen Donates)
One million

191
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:01,990
("Diamond Candy" Worth One Million)
for a candy?

192
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,400
(The Auction Took A Magical Turn)
Isn't this ridiculous?

193
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,830
He only came back to Xinghan
to stand up for Gu Liusu.

194
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,400
But a charity gala

195
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,470
is just about voluntarily donating
unused items.

196
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,800
It doesn't matter
whether the item has value or not.

197
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,750
Isn't the goal to do charity?

198
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,800
How can he earn those executives'
respect that way?

199
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,630
He acts like a spoiled rich kid.

200
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,350
I wonder what he learned overseas
all these years.

201
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,110
Chivalry, maybe.

202
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:30,320
Lin Xiang always abuses people

203
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,590
because of his wealth.

204
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,870
Mo Li,

205
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,110
go to Xinyi and clean up the mess
Xingchen caused yesterday.

206
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:46,560
Yes.

207
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,280
Okay.

208
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,870
If you're free this afternoon,

209
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,320
ask Gu Liusu out for tea.

210
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,680
What are you planning?
Trying to stop them?

211
00:09:59,777 --> 00:10:02,200
I'm telling you, your son
isn't good enough for my bestie.

212
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,230
I didn't mean that.

213
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,230
My son has good taste

214
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,560
like me.

215
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,320
But I think he might make things worse
even if he means well.

216
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,040
Nice one, bro.

217
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,590
You saved a damsel in distress.

218
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,160
That's called diversion.

219
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,350
Lin Xiang won't miss the chance

220
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,470
to butter up Xinghan.

221
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,710
Bro, you're smart.

222
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,350
If I were Ms. Gu, I'd be so touched.

223
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,320
Let me check
if she replies to my message.

224
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,920
Don't go. Let's have another drink.

225
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,750
Mr. Lin,

226
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,320
let's talk about the auction payment.

227
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,400
What?

228
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,440
The father is cleaning up
his son's mess?

229
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,830
He thinks Xinyi can't afford a million?

230
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,560
How about we discuss this privately?

231
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,200
Give us the room.

232
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,160
Mr. Mo.

233
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,750
There are outsiders,
so I was just pretending.

234
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,560
Have you had enough of the good life

235
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,680
and wanted to go to jail?

236
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,733
Did you take the photo at the auction?

237
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,160
I...

238
00:11:59,280 --> 00:11:59,960
Answer me!

239
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,830
Cat got your tongue?

240
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,800
No.... Why so worked up?

241
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,280
I told you not to mess with Gu Liusu.

242
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,510
Don't you understand?

243
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,080
You hate Lu Xingchen, don't you?

244
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,990
She's Lu Xingchen's woman!

245
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,800
Lu Xingchen's woman?

246
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,830
Who told you that?

247
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,680
Mr. Lin,

248
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,830
are you that eager to buy GL?

249
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,230
Well, well.

250
00:12:29,933 --> 00:12:31,800
Don't you fear being choked
by your own greed?

251
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,960
You know I have enough evidence
to put you behind bars, don't you?

252
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,555
Be an obedient dog
if you don't want to go in.

253
00:12:59,555 --> 00:13:01,510
Why are you siding with Gu Liusu?

254
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,400
Are you still eating?

255
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,470
Well...

256
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,590
Don't be nervous.

257
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,560
Let's talk about the auction.

258
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,710
Sure.

259
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,400
Have a drink.

260
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,110
Let the auction matter pass.

261
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,560
I don't get

262
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,680
why you keep cleaning up
Lu Xingchen's mess.

263
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,960
I told you to watch my son.

264
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,750
Is this how you do it?

265
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,630
(Because someone asked me
to look after him.)
