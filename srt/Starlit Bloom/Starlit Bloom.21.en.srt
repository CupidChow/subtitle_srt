00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:17,270
Lu!

4
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,060
(In Surgery)

5
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,110
How could this happen?

6
00:01:46,244 --> 00:01:48,670
Why didn't you tell me about
what happened in the company?

7
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,390
I'm sorry, Mr. Xingchen.

8
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,760
Lu's been in there for four hours.

9
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,800
I'm really scared
something might happen to him.

10
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,040
Don't worry. This is the best hospital.

11
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,240
He'll be fine.

12
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,520
I'd rather it be me lying in there.

13
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,150
How could this happen?

14
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,040
Lu Xingchen,

15
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,670
let Mo Li take care of his wound first,
all right?

16
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,110
The police are already
tracking down the driver.

17
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,990
Mo Li's injury looks serious.

18
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,920
Sorry.

19
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,960
How's he, Doctor?

20
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,480
He's stable for now,

21
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,040
but needs to be closely monitored.

22
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,670
The patient will be moved to the ICU.

23
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,933
Who will sign the consent form?

24
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,830
I'm his wife.

25
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,390
But we're not married yet.

26
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,870
I'll sign.

27
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,830
I'm his son.

28
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:18,790
Will my dad be okay?

29
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,760
Wait for further notice.

30
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,030
(Gu Liusu,)

31
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,030
(two people you most care about
are both a mess right now.)

32
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,120
(You need to calm down.)

33
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,270
(You must calm down.)

34
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,620
(Nurses' Station)

35
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,000
Alright.

36
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,230
Sorry.

37
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,790
It's fine. I can do it myself.

38
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,640
You haven't left?

39
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,760
Eat something.

40
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,830
No need.

41
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,080
Lu Xingchen,

42
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,080
you can't collapse.

43
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,320
Xinghan needs you now.

44
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,590
Yes.

45
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:12,560
I know.

46
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,230
I'll be right outside.

47
00:06:16,466 --> 00:06:17,680
Call me if you need anything.

48
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,830
Alright.

49
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,470
Thank you.

50
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,790
Dad.

51
00:06:56,866 --> 00:06:58,000
You're tired, aren't you?

52
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,350
Take a good rest.

53
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,680
Funny, isn't it?

54
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,350
I've been so busy at the office

55
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,000
these past few days.

56
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,830
When I was a kid, I thought

57
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,150
I ate alone,

58
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,640
slept alone,

59
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,000
and played games alone

60
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,680
because you all didn't like me.

61
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,590
Now I know

62
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,590
I misunderstood you.

63
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,390
You can hear me, right?

64
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,120
Dad.

65
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,830
All these years,

66
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:01,200
we've never really had

67
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,880
a proper

68
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,590
and heart-to-heart talk.

69
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,590
How about this?

70
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,320
When you wake up...

71
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,560
Once you wake up,

72
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:16,680
I will

73
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,910
take over Xinghan.

74
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,520
No more screw-ups.

75
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:26,790
I'll do anything

76
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,120
you say.

77
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,870
I'm begging you, Dad.

78
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,510
I've lost Mom.

79
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,750
I can't lose you too.

80
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,320
Dad.

81
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,400
Please wake up.

82
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,710
Please.

83
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,560
Baozhu.

84
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,630
I'm good.

85
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,470
What's with that look?

86
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,470
I'm fine, really.

87
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:30,960
Go home.

88
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,750
You've been here all night.

89
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,080
I can take care of myself.

90
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,320
Are you sure?

91
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,510
Yes.

92
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,750
Go home.

93
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,080
Alright.

94
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,750
If you're fine, I'll go.

95
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,750
I'm a grown-up.

96
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,040
I'll take care of myself.

97
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,230
Go on.

98
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,680
Go.

99
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:57,630
Come on.

100
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,750
Don't ask me to walk you out.

101
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,750
Quick.

102
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,470
Go on.

103
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,630
(I knew they were
all pretending that day.)

104
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,800
(But the adult's world is cruel.)

105
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,560
(Respecting Baozhu's lie)

106
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,750
(is the only thing I can.)

107
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,750
You know what to do, do you?

108
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,110
Yes.

109
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,680
Let me check on my wife, please.

110
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,990
Dear, you're saved.

111
00:11:04,466 --> 00:11:06,280
We've got the money
for the kidney transplant.

112
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,750
You must wake up.

113
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,222
(City News. Latest Update)
Did you drink that night?

114
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,620
(Earlier, the president
of Xinghan Group)

115
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,460
(was hit by a car
in a development area.)

116
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,860
(The driver has turned himself in
to the police.)

117
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,140
(He claimed he fled the scene
out of fear.)

118
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,230
(Police tests revealed
his blood alcohol level)

119
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,560
(exceeded the legal limit.)

120
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,370
(The case has been identified
as drunk driving.)

121
00:11:29,377 --> 00:11:29,960
(Currently,)

122
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,750
(Xinghan Group's president,
Lu Jianhua, remains in a coma.)

123
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,955
(We'll continue to bring you updates
on this story.)

124
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,320
Ms. Gu.

125
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,440
Yes?

126
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,630
This is the PR plan we prepared
for Xinghan.

127
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,470
Please review it.

128
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,777
First, justify the demolition.
Second, protect the company's image.

129
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:01,870
Okay.

130
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,800
We'll proceed with this.

131
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,280
Okay.

132
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,870
You've worked hard.

133
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,230
Not at all.

134
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,160
You should get some rest.
