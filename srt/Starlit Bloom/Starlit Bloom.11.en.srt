=Episode 11=

3
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,639
Ms. Gu.

4
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:06,418
If GL could work with Xinyi,

5
00:01:06,419 --> 00:01:09,279
it would set a new standard
for the jewelry industry.

6
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,200
We'd surely be
the industry's number one.

7
00:01:12,699 --> 00:01:14,919
Mr. Lin, fame draws trouble.

8
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,999
Isn't it better to let all succeed?

9
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,459
Xuan, fetch my wine from the car.

10
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,698
Tonight, I'll have a good drink
with the two bosses.

11
00:01:21,699 --> 00:01:23,400
Good idea.

12
00:01:25,059 --> 00:01:25,739
Really?

13
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,919
Go.

14
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,919
(Today's dinner guests
are ill-intentioned. Backup.)

15
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,200
Something came up. I have to go.

16
00:01:40,699 --> 00:01:41,840
Where to?

17
00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:49,559
And you said you didn't like her.

18
00:01:51,139 --> 00:01:54,138
Isn't GL backed by Lu Jianhua?

19
00:01:54,139 --> 00:01:56,338
If you want a man,

20
00:01:56,339 --> 00:01:58,218
you could just choose me.

21
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:59,739
I can do that.

22
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:03,919
My overseas assets
are no less than Lu Jianhua's.

23
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,058
A woman's destiny

24
00:02:08,059 --> 00:02:11,799
is to find a man in the end.

25
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:16,679
Mr. Lin.

26
00:02:18,779 --> 00:02:19,959
Mr. Lin.

27
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,880
A toast to you.

28
00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:24,359
You speak so pleasantly.

29
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:26,218
That's more like it.

30
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:27,639
Good.

31
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:42,899
You're really profiting
from today's medical fee.

32
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,498
You little vixen.

33
00:02:44,499 --> 00:02:46,200
What nonsense is this?

34
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:49,259
- Mr. Lin.
- Mr. Lin.

35
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,979
Now we're both fighting.

36
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,799
Your medical fee's gone again.

37
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:54,498
Mr. Lin.

38
00:02:54,499 --> 00:02:55,019
Gu Liusu.

39
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,618
Call the police!

40
00:02:55,619 --> 00:02:58,818
- Calm down.
- Call the police!

41
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:00,079
- Lin Xiang!
- Call the police!

42
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,280
Mr. Lin.

43
00:03:03,499 --> 00:03:04,760
Call the police!

44
00:03:05,499 --> 00:03:06,600
Gu Liusu.

45
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:08,720
You're bleeding?

46
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,200
Call the police.

47
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,880
Alright, I'll go now.

48
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,338
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

49
00:03:15,339 --> 00:03:16,440
Why are you here?

50
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:17,699
Does it hurt?

51
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,880
Don't look so glum. It's just wine.

52
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,658
I already know

53
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:25,119
(Police)
what happened.

54
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:28,119
This does count as excessive defense.

55
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:30,699
The other party
will get a medical appraisal.

56
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,459
He insists on legal action.

57
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,359
You weren't even invited to this dinner,

58
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,880
yet you showed up and attacked someone.

59
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,019
You think you're innocent?

60
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,299
Even if she's your girlfriend,
it's no excuse. Understand?

61
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,239
I...

62
00:03:42,779 --> 00:03:44,019
She's not my girlfriend.

63
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,179
Not your girlfriend?

64
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,320
What are you doing then?
Acting righteous?

65
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,359
I'm her boss.

66
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,739
I get how you feel,

67
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,419
but hitting people is wrong.

68
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,139
Understand?

69
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,919
That brat dares to hit me!

70
00:03:58,059 --> 00:03:58,979
You old pervert!

71
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,579
You lecher,
how dare you act so righteous?

72
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,498
Wait and see!

73
00:04:01,499 --> 00:04:02,139
Brat!

74
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,139
You'll get a criminal record,
you know that?

75
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,000
You might as well go and talk it out.

76
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,459
Apologize or offer compensation
if needed.

77
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,960
He harassed her.
Why should we apologize?

78
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,919
I know.

79
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:11,139
Officer.

80
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,179
I'll go apologize.

81
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:12,938
Apologize?

82
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:14,600
Why should we apologize?

83
00:04:14,779 --> 00:04:17,039
Lu Xingchen, let go.

84
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,719
Let go!

85
00:04:31,179 --> 00:04:32,059
Sir.

86
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,019
Calm down.

87
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:33,778
Alright, Sir.

88
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:35,639
Don't be mad.

89
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,059
Officer.

90
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,738
May I speak privately with Mr. Lin?

91
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:40,538
You may.

92
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:41,560
Thank you.

93
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,360
Watch your attitude.

94
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,599
Mr. Lin.

95
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:52,800
I'm sorry for what happened.

96
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,399
I apologize to you.

97
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,560
As long as you agree to one condition,

98
00:04:58,779 --> 00:05:00,279
I can settle this with you.

99
00:05:00,739 --> 00:05:04,680
You're negotiating with me?

100
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,760
Do you think you have the right
to bargain with me?

101
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:16,039
Mr. Jing's half of the jewelry
went to Xinyi, right?

102
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:23,000
And about Xinyi's slander
against GL earlier,

103
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,279
I can give you the original contract.

104
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,719
I wonder if you're satisfied
with this gift.

105
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:34,619
What's the condition?

106
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,839
Sign a letter of forgiveness
for Lu Xingchen.

107
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,680
I can sign it,

108
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,920
but I can't swallow this anger.

109
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,000
Ms. Gu, slap yourself three times,

110
00:05:46,739 --> 00:05:49,039
then I can forgive him.

111
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,599
Isn't it just to cheer Mr. Lin up?

112
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:02,519
Easy.

113
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,240
Gu Liusu, what are you doing?

114
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,418
Lin Xiang, are you looking for trouble?

115
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:15,338
What are you doing?

116
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:17,778
What are you doing? Mind your attitude!

117
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:20,839
Lu Xingchen, this is a police station.

118
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,658
Calm down.

119
00:06:22,659 --> 00:06:23,338
Officer.

120
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:26,479
He keeps giving you trouble.
How can I stay calm?

121
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:30,159
Mr. Lu.

122
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,059
Mr. Lu.

123
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,680
What brings you here?

124
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,978
Be careful with your behavior in public.

125
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:36,658
Don't cause more trouble.

126
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:37,858
Officer.

127
00:06:37,859 --> 00:06:39,379
Sorry for the trouble.

128
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,680
It's the kid's fault.

129
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:42,858
Come with me.

130
00:06:42,859 --> 00:06:44,000
Sign here.

131
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:47,880
Mr. Lu, I'll go now.

132
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:55,120
Get in the car.

133
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:14,039
You said you'd handle Lin Xiang

134
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:16,120
and look after Gu Liusu.

135
00:07:16,179 --> 00:07:17,560
Is this how you do it?

136
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,139
Should I beat someone
and end up in the police station,

137
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,560
then have your father
clean up your mess?

138
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,240
Get in the car.

139
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,320
Still not getting in?

140
00:07:34,299 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm taking Gu Liusu home.

141
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,920
I told you to watch my son.

142
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,719
Is this how you do it?

143
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:54,079
I'm sorry.

144
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:38,160
How about a walk?

145
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,999
Okay.

146
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:54,640
I was impulsive today.
I didn't expect you'd come.

147
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,359
I was worried about you.

148
00:08:56,939 --> 00:08:59,680
I just wanted to use the contract
to vent my anger,

149
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,040
but dragged you into it.

150
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:05,040
It's nothing like that.

151
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,479
Gu Liusu.

152
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:17,719
Next time, don't drink so much.

153
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,619
They won't respect you more

154
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,800
just because you drink more.

155
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,239
You don't need to prove
your worth to anyone.

00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,959
