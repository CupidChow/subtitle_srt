- All right.

Hey.

35
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,270
What to do?

00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,870
I'm really not in the mood to work.

00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,200
I just want to go on a date.

38
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,870
Secretary Lu,
this line is for business calls only.

39
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,960
Can you hear my heartbeat?

40
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,200
Thump...

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:27,920
Ah!

42
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,390
Mm.

43
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,990
You're my girlfriend now.

44
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,240
So...

45
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,110
When can we go on a date?

46
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,990
I'm free after work tonight.

47
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,550
(That's my girlfriend.)

48
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,710
(That's my girlfriend!)

49
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,480
Yes? Mo Li?

50
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,366
Liusu. Can you talk right now?

51
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,360
What's up?

52
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,520
I just got to the office.

53
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,960
I wanted to go over

54
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,155

for the charity auction with you.

55
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,390
Okay. I'll be right there.

56
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,760
I'm here to give my report.

57
00:04:27,466 --> 00:04:28,390
Where are you headed?

58
00:04:30,177 --> 00:04:33,080
Since when does the boss have
to report her schedule to her secretary?

59
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,350
I'm coming too!

60
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,830
What's the matter, Mo Li?

61
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:47,270
Liusu.

62
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,790
You called so early. It sounded urgent.

63
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,790
Wait at another table.

64
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,270
Liusu.

65
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,200
Give me a cup of coffee.

66
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,019
I wanted to show you

67
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,080
the tentative guest list

68
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,560
for the charity auction.

69
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:07,520
Sure.

70
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,560
Some are long-time brands,

71
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,270
others are new.

72
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,220
Everyone on the list
has been vetted financially.

73
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,440
- There are no shell companies.
- Thank you.

74
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,440
You're thorough.

75
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,266
Now I see why Mr. Lu
speaks so highly of you.

76
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,150
Even high salaries can't lure you away.

77
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,880
Mr. Lu has always been good to me.

78
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,177
When someone shows you kindness,
you return it tenfold.

79
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,080
One more thing I want to run by you.

80
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,440
Yes?

81
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,350
Would you consider

82
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,960
inviting Mr. Lin from Xinyi Group?

83
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,120
Mr. Lin might be ruthless in business,

84
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,200
but regardless of motive,

85
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,710
he has donated a lot to the orphanage.

86
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,030
Still,

87
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,560
I'd like to hear your opinion.

88
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,640
Invite him. We should.

89
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,150
Should, my foot!

90
00:06:05,355 --> 00:06:07,560
That old man Lin Xiang
bribed reporters to smear you,

91
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,390
stole your diamonds,

92
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,980
and even got handsy with you at dinner.

93
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,960
Can't you stand up
for yourself for once?

94
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:13,760
Mr. Xingchen.

95
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,790
A secretary
doesn't make decisions for his boss.

96
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,320
You like Liusu, don't you?

97
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,200
Mind your words.

98
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,640
We're just colleagues.

99
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,440
All right.

100
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:30,590
If you say so.

101
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,760
Then, let me make an announcement.

102
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,080
Gu Liusu

103
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,000
is my girlfriend now.

104
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,710
So, you don't have a shot anymore.

105
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:42,270
Also,

106
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,680
I don't want scum like Lin Xiang
anywhere near her.

107
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,830
We should still go
with Ms. Liusu's decision.

108
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,960
Decision, my foot!

109
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,560
What's with all this righteousness talk?

110
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:03,000
Do what makes yourself happy.
That's what really matters.

111
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,030
Besides, Lin Xiang's an old snake.

112
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,760
Don't be fooled by his donations.

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,120
He's just putting on a show.

114
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:14,320
Like he'd ever turn good

115
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,511
because of one invitation.

116
00:07:15,511 --> 00:07:16,560
Keep dreaming!

117
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,760
Anyway,

118
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:23,440
I can't be by my girlfriend's side
twenty-four seven.

119
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,350
I just want her
to think of herself first

120
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,270
whenever she decides something.

121
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,590
Lu Xingchen, where do you come up
with all this nonsense?

122
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,320
Go back to your seat, Secretary Lu.

123
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,640
So what do you say, Liusu?

124
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,790
I lied.

125
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,390
I don't want to see Lin Xiang.

126
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,880
If possible,

127
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,288
I never want to see him again.

128
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,230
Okay.

129
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,520
I'll revise the guest list.

130
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,230
Mm.

131
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,320
Thank you.

132
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,710
I have other things to attend to.

133
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:08,390
I'll head back.

134
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:08,910
Okay.

135
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,710
Mr. Lu's been running a fever for days.

136
00:08:17,022 --> 00:08:19,955
Secretary Lu, maybe you should go home
and check on your family too.

137
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,111
Is he jealous of me?

138
00:08:28,111 --> 00:08:30,640
Can't win an argument,
so he throws my dad in my face.

139
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,440
Secretary Lu, when I'm working outside,

140
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,200
can you please stop following me around?

141
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,470
I refuse.

142
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,320
I didn't do anything wrong.

143
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,800
From now on,

144
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,870
I'll try to remember to put myself first
before making any decisions.

145
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,160
Let me put it on for you.

146
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,060
(Tea)

147
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,510
Your son's here.

148
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,320
Come in!

149
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,560
You're already here. Come inside!

150
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:49,630
Come on!

151
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,400
Lu.

152
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:58,960
Take a seat.

153
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,750
Here you go. You two have a nice chat.

154
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,680
(Tang Baozhu)
(Bestie, you're a miracle worker!)

155
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,590
(Lu Xingchen actually came back!)

156
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,350
(Gu Liusu)
(It wasn't all me.)

157
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,160
(He needed a reason
to convince himself.)

158
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,990
Why do you think I work myself
to the bone every day?

159
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,920
I do it all for our family!

160
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,440
Have you even thought about Xingchen?

161
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,110
So you get to work,

162
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,560
but I can't, and I have
to stay home with the boy?

163
00:11:32,622 --> 00:11:33,510
He's not just my son.

164
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,800
He's yours too!

165
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,750
How can you say that?

166
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,320
Are you even fit to be a mother?

167
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,040
Listen.

168
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,044
If you can't handle this,
let's just get divorced!

169
00:11:40,044 --> 00:11:41,044
Fine by me!

170
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,830
Li, take him to school.

171
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,990
How's work at GL?

172
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,320
Fine.

173
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,750
I heard you exposed Lin Xiang

174
00:12:14,955 --> 00:12:16,400
for bribing reporters to smear GL.

175
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,333
You've offended a lot of senior figures.

176
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,080
What are you going to do now?

177
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,470
Gu Liusu said

178
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:26,333
she's not planning
to make any other moves for now.

179
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,040
Besides,

180
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,870
Lin Xiang doesn't deserve
to be called a "senior" anything.

181
00:12:30,955 --> 00:12:32,400
I don't care if I offended him.

182
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,830
Liusu is being cautious, as always.

183
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,800
You, on the other hand,
are still too young.

184
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,160
You always say such immature things.

185
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,230
You look fine to me.

186
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,110
I'll get going.

187
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,230
You should consider retiring soon.

188
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,630
If your health goes,

189
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,710
no amount of money will matter.

190
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,160
Retire?

191
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,920
If you won't come back to the company,

192
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,080
who am I supposed to hand it to?

193
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,440
To someone capable.

194
00:13:29,377 --> 00:13:30,733
It's a new era.

195
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:32,820
Inheritance isn't passed down
just by family anymore.

196
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,630
That Mo Li

197
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,680
might be stiff and uptight,

198
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,750
but he's good at his job.

199
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,830
Let him take on more

200
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:42,920
and you can finally rest.

201
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,920
But he's not family.

202
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,160
No matter what you say,

203
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,830
Mo Li will always be an outsider.

204
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,320
You can't hold on to it.
