=Episode 4=

3
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,359
Are you saying

4
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,719
the original artwork you posted

5
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:05,959
is with you?

6
00:01:08,488 --> 00:01:09,950
Why would the original be with you?

7
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,799
I met her once.

8
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:17,710
Bring the original to the station.

9
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:19,480
We'll verify it first,

10
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,244
and then we'll see
if what you said is true.

11
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,488
I have some paperwork
that needs to be filled out.

12
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,566
- I'll take care of it.
- I'll take care of it.

13
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:36,760
Lu Xingchen,

14
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,480
come with me.

15
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,239
Is the designer really dead?

16
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,040
Can you tell me her name?

17
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:48,280
Lu Xingchen,

18
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,959
why do you have Starry Sea's sketch?

19
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,239
Why are you messing with GL?

20
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,519
Do you know what we've sacrificed
for Starry Sea?

21
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,840
Right now,

22
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,959
the whole company's a mess
because of this!

23
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,519
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,640
I just wanted
to find her on the internet.

25
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:06,400
I never meant for any of this to happen...

26
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,479
Either way,

27
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,911
return the sketch to the company.

28
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,080
I refuse.

29
00:02:11,288 --> 00:02:12,577
Are you trying to play games?

30
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,639
- Is this yours?
- Is it yours then?

31
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,400
But...

32
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,280
She's already dead. I'm not fighting
with you over commercial rights.

33
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,039
Why can't you let me keep it
as a memento?

34
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:26,560
Mr. Mo,

35
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,840
you've seen Mr. Xingchen's
flippant attitude.

36
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,520
GL will pursue the losses
from this matter to the end.

37
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:35,749
Ms. Gu,

38
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,466
there must be
some misunderstanding here.

39
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,520
Emotionally and logically,

40
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,200
Mr. Xingchen just came back
to the country.

41
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,422
He has no reason to target GL.

42
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,520
Feelings and logic

43
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,719
are two different things.

44
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,199
GL is under public scrutiny
because of this.

45
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,599
- Who will be responsible for the losses?
- I will.

46
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,800
Who do you think you are?

47
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,759
Let me tell you, Gu Liusu.

48
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,560
GL's works

49
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,800
are all just for show.

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,599
And you're so judgmental
and disrespectful!

51
00:03:04,155 --> 00:03:05,529
Because of your personal reasons,

52
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,000
you caused huge losses to the company,

53
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,400
so you're fired.

54
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,240
You think
I want to stay here to serve you?

55
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,240
Well, you're wrong!

56
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,960
You didn't fire me!

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,759
I quit!

58
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:21,560
Ms. Gu,

59
00:03:21,866 --> 00:03:23,400
I apologize on behalf of Mr. Xingchen.

60
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,911
Please give me some time.

61
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,000
I'll sort this out.

62
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:36,240
I told you to keep an eye on Xingchen!

63
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:37,639
How could you let this happen?

64
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:39,439
It's my fault.

65
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,520
There was an incident.

66
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,377
There seems to be some misunderstanding

67
00:03:43,377 --> 00:03:44,577
between Ms. Gu and Mr. Xingchen.

68
00:03:44,577 --> 00:03:45,244
Liusu?

69
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,400
What misunderstanding?

70
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,800
Gu Liusu is too stubborn.

71
00:03:48,955 --> 00:03:50,280
It's been published for a while.

72
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,080
Does it matter who has the original?

73
00:03:52,177 --> 00:03:53,240
Tell her to name her price.

74
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,400
I'll pay for it.

75
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:56,800
I'll even buy the copyright outright.

76
00:03:57,444 --> 00:03:58,630
How can you speak like that?

77
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,199
Show some respect to your elders.

78
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,240
Why are you so angry?

79
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,400
Original? Copyright?

80
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,511
What are you talking about?

81
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,199
If there's anything, you can tell me.

82
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,280
If I can help, I will.

83
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:14,039
Mr. Xingchen posted
the missing person notice

84
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:15,719
that went viral.

85
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,879
It seems he accidentally

86
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,279
revealed GL's unpublished sketch.

87
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,279
What?

88
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,240
You posted it online?

89
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,279
Do you know
how much trouble you caused Liusu?

90
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,519
What are your intentions?

91
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,959
Also,

92
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:34,199
why do you have Liusu's design sketch?

93
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:36,839
What did you say?

94
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,319
Gu Liusu drew that sketch?

95
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,920
Who else? You think I did?

96
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:46,839
You remind me

97
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,759
of someone.

98
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,639
Xingchen!

99
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,240
Follow him.

100
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,920
Your son

101
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,040
has a lot

102
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,240
to learn from you.

103
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,920
It's good that he's out

104
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,480
getting some experience.

105
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,439
(Hello, Liusu.)

106
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,079
(I'm Volora's younger sister.)

107
00:05:35,777 --> 00:05:38,888
(Volora sadly passed away last week
because of the war.)

108
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,959
(Wishing you peace.)

109
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:47,680
(You inspired the Starry Sea project.)

110
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,839
(You're gone now.)

111
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,600
(What am I supposed to do?)

112
00:05:56,044 --> 00:05:58,310
Things are really bad this time.
What should we do?

113
00:05:58,839 --> 00:05:59,639
I don't know.

114
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,360
Her close friend

115
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,319
suddenly died.

116
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,444
Wouldn't anyone be upset?

117
00:06:03,533 --> 00:06:04,560
Talk to her...

118
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:06,439
Where's Ms. Gu?

119
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,040
She's right there.

120
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,829
Bold of you to show up.

121
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,750
This is all your fault.

122
00:06:11,755 --> 00:06:12,680
Go apologize to her.

123
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:13,480
We're busy.

124
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,199
Let's go.

125
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,720
They say your dad is
landing a big project.

126
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,360
Hand over some more cash.

127
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:24,977
Didn't I give you money last time?

128
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,879
What are you doing?

129
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,959
- Let's get out of here!
- Picking on kids, huh?

130
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,879
Mr. Xingchen!

131
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,959
Where are you, Mr. Xingchen?

132
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,040
Mr. Xingchen!

133
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,044
Look after him.
I'm going after those bullies!

134
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,879
Don't run!

135
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,120
Stop!

136
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,510
Where do you think you're going?

Ms. Gu.

144
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:47,480
Why haven't you processed
his resignation yet?

145
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:50,829
He was fired after only three days.

146
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,040
I haven't even gotten around
to processing his onboarding.

147
00:07:53,044 --> 00:07:54,310
How many times have I told you?

148
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,879
GL's work policy
is to get things done the same day.

149
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,519
Do my words not mean anything?

150
00:07:59,444 --> 00:08:00,911
I'll take care of it right now.

151
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,000
See yourself out.

Gu Liusu.

153
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,040
Gu Liusu!

154
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,240
Gu Liusu!

155
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:18,959
What exactly

156
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:19,680
do you want?

157
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,360
You drew the design, so why tell
the media the designer is dead?

158
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,066
Eight years ago,
when you were out scouting locations,

159
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,680
you ran into some bullies.

160
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:31,240
You saved a little boy from them.

161
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,399
That boy was me.

162
00:08:32,955 --> 00:08:34,270
You dropped your design sketches.

163
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,080
Remember?

164
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,840
Stop.

165
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:38,000
Is that really your excuse

166
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,440
for posting on social media
and causing GL such a huge loss?

167
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:45,679
Sorry.

168
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,440
I just wanted
to find the owner of this sketch.

169
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,879
I didn't expect it to cause such a stir.

170
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,679
I did lose the sketch once

171
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,480
but I don't remember where.

172
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,879
I have no memory

173
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:57,480
of your "little boy" or the bullies.

174
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,360
In any case,

175
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,200
return the sketch to GL.

176
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,120
No memory?

177
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:05,720
Impossible! Look at me.

178
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:09,840
Look at me!

179
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,879
I get it.

180
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:25,200
You won't admit it's your design.

181
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,279
You claim it belongs to someone else,

182
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:28,720
and then create

183
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,559
a story about a dead designer

184
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,360
to make customers pay for it, right?

185
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,559
I suggest you write novels instead.

186
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:40,120
GL's marketing tactics

187
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,200
are disgusting.

188
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,679
And it's all because of you!

189
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:44,159
I'm running out of patience.

190
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,000
Baozhu had to plead for you repeatedly

191
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,799
for me to tolerate this.

192
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,360
Don't push your luck.

193
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:50,519
That's all

194
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,720
I have to say.

195
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,519
Get out of my company right now!

196
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,759
How could she?

197
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:24,919
How could she

198
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:26,360
not remember anything?

199
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,111
I finally found her...

200
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:41,879
I didn't even get to thank her yet,

201
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:44,480
and she already hates me...

202
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,480
Does she really not remember me?

203
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,360
Is she just suffering from amnesia?

204
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:01,360
Gu Liusu...

205
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:05,360
Mr. Xingchen,

206
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,240
you've had too much to drink.

207
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:10,120
I can't believe
she doesn't remember me...

208
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,519
Who?

209
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,360
That can't be right.

210
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,960
That

211
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,840
cold

212
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,720
and heartless woman.

213
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,159
There's not a single ray of warmth
in her heart.

214
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,399
She can't be the one I'm looking for.

215
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,240
I'll take you home.

216
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:35,919
Don't touch me!

217
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:47,799
That's the face!

218
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,080
The face of a workaholic!

219
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:52,039
My dad's not even here.

220
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,279
Who are you pretending for,

221
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,240
huh?

222
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:56,080
Mr. Lu instructed me

223
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,080
to take good care of you.

224
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:06,200
I know.

225
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:08,320
It's that gold digger.

226
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,360
She and that gold digger

227
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:13,679
must be working together!

228
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,919
Curse them!

229
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,639
Give me that gold digger's contact.

230
00:12:18,888 --> 00:12:20,200
And who is this "gold digger"?

231
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,240
Tang Baozhu, obviously!

232
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,080
He must've watched
way too many soap operas

233
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,200
to come up with such a pathetic excuse.

234
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,440
It's such a typical story
where the woman rescues the guy.

235
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,080
I can't believe he came up
with such an overused cliché.

236
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:44,039
The thing is, I really don't remember
where I lost Starry Sea.

237
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:45,879
And it's not like

238
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,240
there could be
such a crazy coincidence, right?

239
00:12:48,488 --> 00:12:51,088
(The person who found my sketch
is my best friend's stepson...)

240
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,039
(And we even...)

241
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:55,120
(Impossible.)

242
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,720
(Not a chance.)

243
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,879
If it were me,

244
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:01,559
I'd let him come back
to the company and make up for it.

245
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:03,519
No!

246
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,909
Not in this life, the next, or any

247
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,244
of the generations after.
I never want to see him again.

248
00:13:07,266 --> 00:13:09,440
Every time I see him,
something bad happens.

249
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,159
But you promised me

250
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,679
you'd give him three chances.

251
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:14,320
He still has two left.

252
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,639
Tang Baozhu.

253
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,480
Do you realize how big a mess I'm in?

254
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,600
Why are you siding with the outsider?

255
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:23,879
Nonsense!

256
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:24,720
I would never!

257
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,559
Never, I say!

258
00:13:26,577 --> 00:13:29,300
To heck with that spoiled rich kid!
Not a single brain cell in his head!

259
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:29,670
Come on.

260
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:31,120
Let's have a toast.

261
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,879
I'll pour some more.

262
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:37,879
Oh, my goodness! Oh, gosh...

263
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:39,639
It's everywhere...

264
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:41,320
Napkins...

265
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:47,159
Not bad.

266
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,279
Need help?

267
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,120
I need you to drink with me.

268
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:52,519
Come on.

269
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,240
I'll visit the orphanage tomorrow.

270
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,320
Are the gifts I bought for the kids
still with you?

271
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,000
Yes, they are.

272
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,480
Bring them to me tomorrow.

273
00:13:58,519 --> 00:13:59,559
Yes, ma'am.

274
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:02,200
Cheers!

275
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,720
If Tang Baozhu is lying to me,

276
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,840
I'll kick her out of the Lu family!

277
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:07,720
Mo Li...

278
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,480
Do you think Gu Liusu drew that sketch?
