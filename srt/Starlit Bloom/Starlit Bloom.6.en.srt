00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:01,800
Mr. Xingchen,

4
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,959
today I'll give you your first lesson

5
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:06,439
on the basics
of corporate business management.

6
00:01:07,059 --> 00:01:08,799
I hope you'll pay attention.

7
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,659
For fundamental business theories,

8
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,659
through learning macroeconomics,

9
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,159
you'll learn how fundamental theories
affect business,

10
00:01:15,339 --> 00:01:18,799
so you can make an economic outlook
in advance when doing strategic planning.

11
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,719
So,

12
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,799
do you know
what an "economic outlook" means?

13
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,258
Why would I need you if I did?

14
00:01:23,259 --> 00:01:24,400
Carry on.

15
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:27,138
The project we developed together
with the environmental agency

16
00:01:27,139 --> 00:01:29,939
generated five revenue growth points
last year.

17
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,618
Macroeconomics is about

18
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:34,439
understanding how the economy
affects business activity.

19
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:36,418
Economic management

20
00:01:36,419 --> 00:01:39,159
and the macroeconomic cycle
are both essential.

21
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:43,240
There's a key point about macroeconomics
in relation to the two.

22
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,079
Do you know what it is?

(What are you doing, Gu Liusu?)

26
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,939
So, the practical theories
we learned earlier

27
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,099
are the most important.

28
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,698
I hope you'll study them well.

29
00:01:59,699 --> 00:02:02,579
Macroeconomics in relation to economic
management and the business cycle...

30
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,379
Is this what I taught you today?

31
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,840
Give it back.

41
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,760
Boss.

42
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:29,679
What's wrong with you?

43
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,639
Why haven't you replied for days?

44
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:33,899
I have an idea.

45
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,338
I figured out the design.

46
00:02:35,339 --> 00:02:36,880
I'll tell you when you get back.

00:02:37,779 --> 00:02:39,338
Gu Liusu.

48
00:02:39,339 --> 00:02:41,560
Why aren't you answering me?

49
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,259
Where are you?

50
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,440
Where are you?

51
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,538
(Hey, why am I laughing?)

52
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:54,839
(Lu Xingchen is Tang Baozhu's stepson.)

53
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:56,839
Gu Liusu.

54
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:00,280
Why aren't you answering me?

55
00:03:00,619 --> 00:03:04,200
Gu Liusu.

56
00:03:10,339 --> 00:03:13,139
All the companies attending the meeting
rank among the top ten in the city.

57
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,979
Mr. Lu's very pleased that you came.

58
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,280
He asked me to assist you.

59
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,079
(Are you sure Gu Liusu is back
from the trip?)

60
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,098
(Of course.)

61
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:32,079
(My bestie would definitely let me know
as soon as she's back.)

62
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,440
I'm going to the bathroom first.

63
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:51,378
You're right, Mr. Lin.

64
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:53,739
- I think we're missing someone.
- Missing someone?

65
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,880
How could she be late
for such an important meeting?

66
00:03:59,059 --> 00:04:01,880
Are you talking about me, Mr. Lin?

67
00:04:02,619 --> 00:04:03,019
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,200
My flight was late.

69
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,778
This is an important event.

70
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,899
Why are you dressed so scantily?

71
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,459
Are you saying I'm underdressed

72
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,299
or that I look good?

73
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,419
Please button up, Mr. Lin.

74
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,440
Cover your big belly.

75
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:15,299
Today's meeting

76
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,899
concerns the city's image.

77
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,139
It doesn't really have anything
to do with fashion, does it?

78
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:19,899
Why not

79
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,399
have our company take charge of it?

80
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:23,178
Anyone capable is welcome to compete.

81
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:26,499
It'd be best to transform the scenic spot
into a large commercial complex

82
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,379
and bring in shopping malls
and luxury hotels.

83
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,939
If we do that, the tourists' impression
on our city culture

84
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,538
will remain only superficial.

85
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:33,978
We're not saints.

86
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:35,298
We need to make money.

87
00:04:35,299 --> 00:04:36,298
We are businesspeople.

88
00:04:36,299 --> 00:04:37,658
I agree with commercialization,

89
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:39,738
but it should complement, not dominate.

90
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:41,000
Ms. Gu,

91
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,200
no wonder you're a businesswoman.

92
00:04:51,299 --> 00:04:52,699
Why pull that long face all day,

93
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,159
like a Persian cat?

94
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:55,839
That's just my face.

95
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:05,599
Boring.

96
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,360
Let's go.

97
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:10,298
This idea

98
00:05:10,299 --> 00:05:11,738
is wonderful,

99
00:05:11,739 --> 00:05:13,579
but it's too idealistic.

100
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,499
I understand you value
economic benefits.

101
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,338
But we can't focus
only on short-term gains

102
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:19,978
and lose the chance
to build the city's soul, right?

103
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:23,978
Culture is something you can't see or touch.

104
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:26,338
How can it sustain a project this big?

105
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:28,800
Have you really
considered everything, Ms. Gu?

106
00:05:31,299 --> 00:05:32,658
Mr. Lin has a point.

107
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:34,778
Yeah. I agree with him.

108
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:37,320
Mr. Lin is far-sighted indeed.

109
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,159
Right.

110
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,560
Oh, Mr. Lin.

111
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:44,719
I was wondering which Mr. Lin it was.

112
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:46,819
Turns out it's that Mr. Lin

113
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,560
who hired trolls to bash GL.

114
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,519
Who are you?

115
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:56,858
Let me introduce you.

116
00:05:56,859 --> 00:05:58,059
Mr. Lu,

117
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,019
representing Xinghan Group
at this meeting.

118
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,440
I'm just Mr. Lu Junior.

119
00:06:05,179 --> 00:06:06,519
Mr. Lin Xiang,

120
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,619
I wonder

121
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,320
if you're unhappy
with Ms. Gu's proposal,

122
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,418
or if Xinyi Jewelry

123
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:14,279
and GL

124
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:16,360
have some irreconcilable conflict?

125
00:06:17,179 --> 00:06:20,538
Ms. Gu runs a fashion brand,

126
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:22,880
and I own a time-honored gold brand.

127
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:26,719
We're in different lines of business.
Why would there be any grudges?

128
00:06:27,299 --> 00:06:29,240
That sounds nice.

129
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,259
But I have a contract

130
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,699
Mr. Lin Xiang signed

131
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,098
with a marketing account.

132
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:35,059
It concerns

133
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,039
how to smear a rising brand,

134
00:06:37,219 --> 00:06:38,560
GL.

135
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,880
Would you like

136
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,760
to take a look together?

137
00:06:43,859 --> 00:06:45,418
Young lad,

138
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:47,218
I won't argue with you for being rude.

139
00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:49,320
But you're talking nonsense.

140
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,159
You!

141
00:06:50,219 --> 00:06:53,519
How would Xinyi Jewelry stoop
to such lowly tricks?

142
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:55,880
Lowly tricks?

143
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:56,920
Fine.

144
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,959
Mr. Lin,

145
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,858
you may pay them

146
00:07:01,859 --> 00:07:02,899
to keep their mouths shut.

147
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,120
But if I pay them a little more,

148
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,719
do you think
they'd still keep your secret?

149
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,120
Mr. Lin.

150
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,000
The media is outside.

151
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,680
If I swing this door open,

152
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,000
whether Xinyi Jewelry
starts trending online or not,

153
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,079
I can't say.

154
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,800
Mr. Mo,

155
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,920
is Xinghan really left in the hands

156
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,880
of this wet-behind-the-ears kid?

157
00:07:43,179 --> 00:07:44,279
Mr. Lin,

158
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,760
since Mr. Xingchen
is representing Xinghan at this meeting,

159
00:07:48,299 --> 00:07:49,760
he has the right...

160
00:07:52,179 --> 00:07:53,699
I'm representing Xinghan.

161
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,200
Nor am I back at Xinghan.

162
00:07:56,299 --> 00:07:57,990
I just can't sit by
and watch it go to waste.

163
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,218
Our city has a unique history and culture.

164
00:08:01,219 --> 00:08:03,880
If we build on that and integrate it
with cultural tourism,

165
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,479
we can attract tourists
with stronger spending power.

166
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:09,279
But look at you.

167
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:12,079
You form cliques for your own interests

168
00:08:12,179 --> 00:08:14,079
and cast the city's development aside.

169
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,320
Very well said.

170
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,399
I have to go.

171
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,459
I have another meeting.

172
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,579
I'll leave you to it.

173
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,560
Ms. Gu,

174
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,858
if you ever need help,

175
00:08:23,859 --> 00:08:26,519
just let us know.

176
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,079
See you, Mr. Lin.

177
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:37,440
Take care, Mr. Lin.

178
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:52,219
I was puzzled

179
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,019
how a post from Shi Yue's Weibo account
with fewer than 2,000 followers

180
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,058
could cause a stir.

181
00:08:57,059 --> 00:09:00,640
It proves I was being used.

182
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:10,418
It really was Xinyi behind it.

183
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:12,040
How could I not have seen it?

184
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,920
How did you get this?

185
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:21,800
The power of money.

186
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:32,920
I helped you.

187
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,178
You don't thank me,

188
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:35,599
and now you're taking my thing.

189
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,499
You should thank yourself.

190
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,400
You cleared yourself of the suspicion
of being involved with Xinyi.

191
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:07,959
Why pull me?

192
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:26,119
You haven't checked my assignment yet,
Gu Liusu.

193
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:29,800
Here's your drink.

194
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,739
That old man Lin Xiang

195
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,698
must've gone crazy trying to buy GL.

196
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:37,320
He actually came up
with such a filthy scheme.

197
00:10:37,819 --> 00:10:40,219
Lu Xingchen must've spent a lot

198
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,920
to get this contract.

199
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,119
Will your husband be okay?

200
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:46,698
My bestie,

201
00:10:46,699 --> 00:10:48,538
we're family now.

202
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:50,920
Helping you is helping his future aunt.

203
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:52,520
Plus,

204
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:54,640
the whole mess started because of him.

205
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,440
He should be the one to clean it up.

206
00:10:57,059 --> 00:10:59,200
He told me he wants to go back to GL.

207
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,440
What do you think?

208
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:05,938
I checked the assignment I gave him.

209
00:11:05,939 --> 00:11:07,680
It's not finished,

210
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,920
but he shows potential.

211
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:12,160
So you agree to let him back?

212
00:11:15,699 --> 00:11:18,440
Tang Baozhu, what's with that look?

213
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,959
You've used up
one of your three chances.

214
00:11:25,939 --> 00:11:27,200
Love you.

215
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:28,658
Let me be clear.

216
00:11:28,659 --> 00:11:31,259
There's no other position left
except executive secretary.

217
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,160
I'll make sure

218
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,599
Secretary Lu starts tomorrow.

219
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,879
Good morning, Ms. Gu.

220
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,440
Good morning.

221
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:14,139
Gu Liusu, you're out of your mind.

222
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,719
How could you trust
what a young boy said?
