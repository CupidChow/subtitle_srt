(Lu Xingchen)
(I kissed Gu Liusu.)

4
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,599
(I actually kissed her!)

5
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,380
Hello?

6
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,359
You kissed my Liusu?

7
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,920
Your Liusu?

8
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:25,640
Didn't you say
you only fancy your goddess,

9
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,319
not the current her?

10
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:28,680
I have no idea.

11
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,280
I can't wrap my head around it.

12
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,159
I just...

13
00:01:32,222 --> 00:01:33,888
(Microphone is enabled)
What do you mean?

14
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:37,640
I couldn't control myself.

15
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,840
Hold on.

16
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,040
She wouldn't think I'm a jerk,
would she?

17
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,519
Look in the mirror
and you'll know the answer.

18
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:46,599
What do I do?

19
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,239
Tell me.

20
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,719
How did she react to that?

21
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:53,599
She...

22
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,040
She...

23
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,680
She made no response.

24
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,000
This is no fun.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,680

Hi, Lu Xingchen.

Lu Xingchen!

How do I face him tomorrow?

(7 July, Thursday, 03:06)

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,159
Never mind.

50
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:28,599
I'll just go to sleep.

51
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,590
I think we just tweak the last proposal,
and that'll do.

52
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:34,960
Good morning, everyone.

53
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,311
- Morning, Ms. Gu.
- Morning, Ms. Gu.

54
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,080
Ghost!

55
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:38,960
Where?

56
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,159
There.

57
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,439
How's the plan for tomorrow's shoot?

58
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:56,759
Ms. Gu, are you
in the right condition for it?

59
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:57,960
I'll do it?

60
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,319
She'll do it?

61
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,680
What on earth?

62
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,159
I told you so, Ms. Gu.

63
00:04:02,488 --> 00:04:05,080
These years, many business owners
are personally getting involved.

64
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,639
Be it livestreams or promos,

65
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,759
audiences do buy into it.

66
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,240
So?

67
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,400
So we all agreed

68
00:04:10,422 --> 00:04:12,910
that this commercial
should be done by you.

69
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,879
That way, we can maximize returns.

70
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,120
But I've never done that before.

71
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,639
What do you mean by that?

72
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:22,360
You've done many interviews and
magazine shoots in the past five years.

73
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,920
This commercial shoot
should be nothing for you.

74
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,519
Ms. Gu, believe in yourself.

75
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:27,319
You can do it.

76
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,279
You got this.

77
00:04:33,911 --> 00:04:34,800
Here's the proposal.

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,160
Since it's a two-person shoot,

79
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,879
we even found you a guy.

80
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:38,600
A guy?

81
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,120
What guy?

82
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:42,680
A male model.

83
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,199
Ugh, no way. I can't manage it.

84
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,279
You'd better find a professional model.

85
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,040
Alright, meeting adjourned.

86
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,680
(So that kiss really meant nothing.)

87
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,733
(He's a mere playboy.)

88
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:06,800
Xiaolu.

89
00:05:07,777 --> 00:05:09,270
Don't forget the shooting proposal.

90
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,079
Su,

91
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,519
you're really off today.

92
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,959
Are you having that?

93
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,680
Yeah.

94
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,800
So I didn't sleep well last night.

95
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:22,759
No wonder.

96
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,920
Here, wear this
to conceal your tiredness.

97
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,240
Do I look that bad?

98
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,319
Very.

99
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,879
Thanks.

100
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:32,920
Don't mention it. I'll get back to work.

101
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,199
Go on.

102
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,519
Good grief, I guess I do look bad.

103
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,920
How could it be this bad?

104
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:52,920
Hello? What's it, Baozhu?

105
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,639
Same place today.

106
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,720
I didn't sleep well last night,

107
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,000
so I need to catch up on sleep.

108
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,040
I've had everything arranged.
You have to be there.

109
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,839
Play it by ear.

110
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,519
Fine, I get it,

111
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:07,279
Baozhu.

112
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,879
She's unbelievable.

113

Brown sugar.

115
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,240
Done.

129
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,070
So Mrs. Lu hangs out
at the regular dance floor?

to drink while on her period.)

134
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:58,120
Tang Baozhu.

135
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,040
If you want to drink,

136
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,120
I can join you.

137
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,920

If you don't listen to me,

141
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,519
I will do it the rough way.

142
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,680
What crazy idea do you have now?

143
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,000
I know a way to regulate and stimulate

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000

145
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,360
It's Liusu.

146
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Shush! She can't know we're here!

147
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,519
(Lu Xingchen?)

148
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,440
Tang Baozhu, have you lost your mind?

149
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,200
What do you think?

150
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:54,480
Here he is!

151
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:58,240
Ms. Liusu.

152
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,000
Mo Li?

153
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,320
Ms. Baozhu.

154
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,840
It's you.

155
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,279
Yes, Ms. Liusu.

156
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,440
It's Mo Li?

157
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:15,360
Tang Baozhu.

158
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:16,600
What are you up to?

159
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:18,000
Why are you here?

160
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:19,519
What are you here?

161
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,799
Why can't I be here?

162
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:22,399
It's just a coincidence.

163
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,399
Come on, have a drink.

164
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,933
Wouldn't that be such a coincidence?

165
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,879
I'm matchmaking Mo Li with Su.

166
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:29,919
What do you think?

167
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:32,200
They look good together, don't they?

168
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:34,120
Here, Ms. Liusu.

169
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,679
A toast to you.

170
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:37,120
I didn't expect Baozhu
to invite you over.

171
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,000
I didn't expect it either.

172
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,399
Not at all.

173
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:45,600
Mo Li.

174
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,519
Regarding the eight shops
I asked you about...

175
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:49,799
How's it going?

176
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,519
I did ask them.

177
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,399
Yet they still need

178
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,639
to verify it.

179
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:55,679
How reckless of him.

180
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:56,120
Fine.

181
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,400
You'll have an answer in two days.

182
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:57,949
Okay.

183
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,000
Don't use Gu Liusu as an excuse
to have fun here.

184
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,279
How could you do this to my dad?

185
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:07,600
Mr. Mo!

186
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,840
How could you turn a blind eye to this?

187
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:11,639
Mr. Xingchen.

188
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,240
It's after hours now.

189
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:14,080
Besides,

190
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,320
nothing's happened.

191
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,480
Lu Xingchen.

192
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:29,759
It's after hours.

193
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,720
What are you doing?

194
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:33,320
My stepmom is drinking here
at this late hour,

195
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,200
and it'd hurt

196
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,749
the Lu family's dignity.

197
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,177
So I'm here to keep an eye on her.

198
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,840
You've finally admitted it.

199
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,559
Leave your aunt alone.

200
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,639
Instead, have a drink with me.

201
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:45,720
Tang Baozhu,

202
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,840
don't push your luck.

203
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:49,000
Kiddo, don't be so mean.

204
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:52,480
Come on.

205
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,519
The show has begun!

206
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,960
Make some noise!

207
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:10,360
Well?

208
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,080
This...

209
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,000
Check that out!

210
00:11:20,444 --> 00:11:22,250
They're even feeding
the crowd with candies!

211
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:32,399
What are you doing?

212
00:11:32,466 --> 00:11:34,355
You'll use the washroom,
and I'll come with you.

213
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:35,639
What on earth is this?

214
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,840
What are you doing, Lu Xingchen?

215
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:39,000
I was enjoying the show.

216
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:40,000
Forget about the show.

217
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,759
Let go!

218
00:11:41,844 --> 00:11:43,888
I never thought
I'd bump into my nemesis here.

219
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,120
So she's the nemesis
you were talking about?

220
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,360
Why? Do you know her?

221
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,480
I don't.

222
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:51,559
I'm counting on you to get
the exclusive raw materials, Mr. Lin.

223
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,039
Looks like

224
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,960
you're a smart man.

225
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,755
- May we have a pleasant cooperation.
- Yes.

226
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,510
What are you doing?

227
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:11,750
