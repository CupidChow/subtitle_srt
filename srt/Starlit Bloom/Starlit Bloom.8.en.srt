Gu Liusu!

00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:13,000
Gu Liusu.

7
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:20,079
The biggest diamond supplier, Mr. Jing,

8
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,280
is now on Horse Island.

9
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,680
Since when did you become paparazzi?

10
00:01:23,822 --> 00:01:25,430
Didn't you tell me to be responsible?

11
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,640
Let's go.

12
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:32,519
Let's go.

13
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,000
Take this.

14
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:47,879
Look at them.

15
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,200
Lu Xingchen, you're my secretary.

16
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,400
Do you think it's proper

17
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,480
to have me take the wheel?

18
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,360
I'll drive after this.

19
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,639
Let's go.

20
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,560
Alright,

21
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,039
let's go!

22
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:27,800
Are you sure this is the place?

23
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:28,800
Of course.

24
00:02:28,911 --> 00:02:29,590
According to...

25
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,400
Stand properly.

26
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,439
According to a reliable insider,

27
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:37,719
Mr. Jing will be here today
discussing a cultural collaboration.

28
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,879
But I've never seen him before.

29
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:42,080
I did.

30
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,439
Come, I'll take you to him.

31
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,479
He's that man in black.

32
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:49,680
Mr. Jing.

33
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,199
Aren't you Mr. Xingchen

34
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:55,479
from Xinghan?

35
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:56,960
You know me?

36
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,360
Then I need not introduce myself.

37
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,800
I'm now the secretary to GL's CEO.

38
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,159
This is my boss.

39
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:06,319
Hello, pardon me for coming uninvited.

40
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,240
I'm Gu Liusu.

41
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:08,639
Hello, Ms. Gu.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,400
This way, please.

43
00:03:12,422 --> 00:03:13,000
Mr. Jing...

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,111
Ms. Gu, this way, please.

45
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,080
I'll park the car.

46
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,280
Mr. Jing.

47
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,919
I actually came
to negotiate a deal with you.

48
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,199
I heard you took over
your father's mines,

49
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:32,080
and you're without regular partners.

50
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,759
I wonder if GL might have the honor

51
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:36,479
of becoming your long-term partner.

52
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,000
Ms. Gu.

53
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:39,680
I admire your sincerity.

54
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:42,360
I'm very straightforward as well.

55
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,000
Today, apart from work,

56
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,280
I'd like to talk about something else.

57
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,000
We've met before.

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,879
Do you still remember?

59
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,000
Since our last meeting,

60
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,560
you've left a deep impression on me.

61
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,360
I wonder if our relationship

62
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,000
could go beyond this.

63
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,039
I have always kept work
and personal life separate.

64
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,719
Feelings and profit
are two different things.

65
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,360
If you have faith in GL's strength,

66
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,400
I'll give you a good answer.

67
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,120
However,

68
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,480
if you don't believe in us,

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,920
we shall consider working with others.

70
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,279
Ms. Gu.

71
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,720
You got this.

72
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:37,759
Ms. Gu.

73
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,040
Perhaps we could

74
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,279
spend some time together
as business partners.

75
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,920
Mr. Jing, do you mean...

76
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,839

Xiaolu told me

124
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,560
that you've put
the Starry Sea project aside.

125
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,279
Why?

126
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,800
Ten years ago, I met a female journalist

127
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,279
during my field trip abroad.

128
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,800
We clicked instantly

129
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,959
and became good friends.

130
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,560
Later, war broke out in her country.

131
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,800
She went to the front line.

132
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:30,639
In her,

133
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,160
I saw how cruel war really was.

134
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:35,240
So I wove feathers symbolizing peace

135
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,519
into an olive branch

136
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,360
and came up with the Starry Sea.

137
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,680
Both of us thought this design

138
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,639
truly expressed our vision.

139
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,079
That sounds meaningful.

140
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,240
Then why did you stop working on it?

141
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,720
Because she died on the front line.

142
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,360
So...

143
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,519
What you said
during the radio interview

144
00:08:08,977 --> 00:08:10,830
wasn't just
to appease public opinion.

145
00:08:11,977 --> 00:08:13,333
You were telling the truth.

146
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,600
Even now, nearly a million people

147
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,079
still live in such conditions.

148
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,399
And yet every day,
I just think about diamonds and design.

149
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,000
Sometimes I really feel powerless.

150
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,919
On one hand, you have to network
with diamond tycoons.

151
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,639
On the other hand,

152
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,759
you feel helpless working
in the diamond industry.

153
00:08:47,466 --> 00:08:48,750
I really can't see through you.

154
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,039
Do what you can first.

155
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,840
Then do what you want.

156
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:57,840
The former makes my livelihood.

157
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:01,200
The latter keeps me hopeful.

158
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,159

159
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:16,080

160
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:19,360
I can feel you want it to be beautiful!

161
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,080
What does the Starry Sea
in your heart look like?

162
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,519
Just pass the beauty in your heart on.

163
00:09:50,644 --> 00:09:51,955
Shall we go horseback riding?

164
00:09:52,822 --> 00:09:55,630
On Horse Island, it'd be a waste
if we don't go horseback riding.

165
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,639
We're here after all.

166
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,159
Want to ride a bit?

167
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,320
My Shark is right here anyway.

168
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,320
I'm kind of tired,

169
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,688
so I don't really feel like riding.

Turning yourself into someone
who's eager to excel

175
