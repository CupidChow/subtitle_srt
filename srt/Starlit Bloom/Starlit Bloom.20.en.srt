00:00:57,085 --> 00:01:00,085
=Episode 20=

3
00:01:06,844 --> 00:01:08,960
Mr. Xingchen has no experience
in managing the company.

4
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,977
Everyone isn't convinced about him
parachuting in.

5
00:01:11,577 --> 00:01:12,600
Mr. Mo, you're here.

6
00:01:12,622 --> 00:01:13,439
You've been working hard lately.

7
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:13,929
This way, please.

8
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:14,422
Alright.

9
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,670
Good morning.

10
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,600
Everyone's here.

11
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,160
Mr. Xingchen,

12
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,750
talk about perfect timing.

13
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:29,600
I heard you're planning reforms.

14
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,640
The company has always run on
a traditional model.

15
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,600
You want a reform as soon as you come.

16
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,720
If something goes wrong,
who will take responsibility?

17
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,240
I will.

18
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,440
Mr. Xingchen,

19
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,390
you've just taken over.

20
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,160
You may not know the full situation yet.

21
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,520
Why don't you reconsider it?

22
00:01:54,933 --> 00:01:55,550
I understand

23
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,440
your concerns.

24
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,310
But times are changing.

25
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,160
If the company doesn't change,

26
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,080
we'll soon be eliminated by the market.

27
00:02:05,066 --> 00:02:07,190
Creating a diverse range
of consumer experiences

28
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,880
is the top priority now.

29
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,360
As if we don't know about it.

30
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:12,960
Guys,

31
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,200
do you think
he knows business management?

32
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,640
This is too risky.

33
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,360
Everyone,

34
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
I actually think
Mr. Xingchen's plan is workable.

35
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,960
He brings fresh ideas and perspective.

36
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,960
The company

37
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,110
mustn't remain unchanged out of fear.

38
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,670
I believe
this is what the company needs.

39
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,360
Mr. Mo,

40
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,080
weren't you always against
sudden reforms?

41
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,200
I have faith in Mr. Xingchen's
vision and ability.

42
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,110
- If so, we can only follow.
- Fine.

43
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,800
No choice. Yeah.

44
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,360
Alright, then.

45
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,520
How about this?

46
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,200
You may head to the meeting room first.

47
00:02:51,244 --> 00:02:53,022
I'll talk to Mr. Xingchen.

48
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,240
Alright, let's go.

49
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,240
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

50
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,550
Finish the current project first.

51
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,110
Even though we're love rivals,

52
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,590
thanks for what you said just now.

53
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,960
Since you're back at Xinghan,

54
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,960
as the executive secretary,

55
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,870
I will fully support you.

56
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:17,870
But I have one question.

57
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,590
Go ahead.

58
00:03:22,044 --> 00:03:24,110
Haven't you always refused to
come back to Xinghan?

59
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,830
I think

60
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:26,990
someone wants me to come back.

61
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:28,960
Mr. Lu?

62
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,760
Gu Liusu.

63
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,020
(Xinghan Group)

64
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:01,040
(This time,
the focus isn't on the design,)

65
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,430
(but on materials.)

66
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:04,830
(Lu: Scan the QR code for a surprise.)
(Recyclable and biodegradable.)

67
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:05,760
(Low-carbon production.)

68
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,480
(These are all certified eco-friendly.)

69
00:04:07,733 --> 00:04:08,710
(Marine grade aluminum)

70
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,488
(is refined from
discarded fishing boats)

71
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:12,960
(and ocean waste.)

72
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,920
(Sea glass)

73
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,550
(is polished by the tides)

74
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,390
(into fragments with gem texture.)

75
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,000
(By combining them,)

76
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,640
(that's my "Tears of the Deep Sea".)

77
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,710
Do you think Xingchen inherited
my business sense?

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,440
He reformed the mall's operation model.

79
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,790
It attracted a ton of young visitors.

80
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,030
This kid has got some skill.

81
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,080
Ever since you two made peace,

82
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,200
I've noticed you're much happier.

83
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,150
You're always talking about him.

84
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:42,150
If this were a short drama,

85
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,270
shouldn't I be fighting him
over money or something?

86
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:45,640
What?

87
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,560
I don't give you enough money to spend?

88
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,880
I'm sure Xingchen is capable enough

89
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,200
to make what he wants.

90
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,560
Let him make money himself.

91
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,350
Oh, right.

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,710
Is he having a fight with Liusu again?

93
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,350
My bestie has been
busy with work lately.

94
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,030
But your son's being too childish.

95
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,390
I don't know how to talk to him.

96
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,710
I just hope they can talk it out.

97
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,030
Help me say something nice to Liusu.

98
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:11,710
Alright.

99
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,270
I helped your son deliver
a necklace over yesterday.

100
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,680
Alright.

101
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,590
I'm heading to work.

102
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,200
Sure.

103
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,640
Wait.

104
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,960
Your glasses.

105
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,080
The young one is Mr. Lu Junior,

106
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,640
and the old one is Mr. Lu Senior.

107
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,230
You're always so thoughtful, Dear.

108
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,440
Alright, I'm off.

109
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,680
Come back early.

110
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,640
I'll wait for you.

111
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,230
Sure.

112
00:05:42,111 --> 00:05:43,460
(According to our station's sources,)

113
00:05:43,466 --> 00:05:44,790
(since 2000, Xinghan Group has embarked)

114
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:48,133
(on its second large-scale construction
of commercial buildings.)

115
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:50,420
(However, there are suspicions
of illegal forced demolitions)

116
00:05:50,422 --> 00:05:51,420
(during this construction.)

117
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,340
(It's said someone has been hurt.)

118
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,900
(Evil company!)

119
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,380
- Give us back our homes!
- Give us back our homes!

120
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,580
(We'll keep following up on this story.)

121
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,590
Mr. Lu.

122
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,270
Go prepare tea first.

123
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:08,560
What's happened?

124
00:06:08,711 --> 00:06:10,644
There was an incident
at the construction site.

125
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,830
A resident

126
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,270
refused to move out.

127
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,320
The foreman tried to force demolition
to meet the deadline,

128
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,590
and someone got hurt.

129
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,880
How could this happen?

130
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,080
I've always stressed safety first

131
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,150
on-site.

132
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:27,790
Look what you've done.

133
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,880
The problem now

134
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,390
is that the worker's family
won't let this go easily.

135
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,230
What matters most right now

136
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,120
is to calm them down.

137
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,320
Where's the family?

138
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,760
At the hospital.

139
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,710
Come with me to the site.

140
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,270
We need to keep the crowd under control.

141
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,150
Does Xingchen know?

142
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,440
I haven't had time to tell him yet.

143
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,030
Don't tell him.

144
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,120
Understood.

145
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,270
Don't worry, Mr. Lu.

146
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,760
We'll handle it.

147
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,640
If this isn't dealt with properly,

148
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,270
it'll hurt the company's reputation.

149
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,000
What I fear most is
that it'll affect Xingchen.

150
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,080
You really love Mr. Xingchen.

151
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,960
He's my only son.

152
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,320
Who else

153
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,640
would I love?

154
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,560
We're almost there.

155
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,960
I'll go take a look first.

156
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,080
Please wait

157
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,960
in the car.

158
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,030
Alright.

159
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,080
Mr. Lu.

160
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,200
What's happened?

161
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,960
Mr. Lu,

162
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,710
do you remember today?

163
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,800
Your dad is Lu Jianhua.

164
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,750
I'll take you to see him, okay?

165
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,960
He's not our family, after all.

166
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,320
How could I hand over my life's work

167
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,440
to an outsider?

168
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,710
I asked you to look after my son.

169
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:51,750
Is this how you do it?

170
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:52,750
I'm sorry.

171
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,990
You said you'd look after Gu Liusu.

172
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,644
Is this what you call
taking care of her?

173
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,040
(Isn't this Gu Nian?)

174
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,750
Gu Nian is Liusu.

175
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,590
Liusu is my girlfriend now.

176
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,750
I'm not giving you any more chances.

177
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,400
If we go out on a date day,

178
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,600
he might get the wrong idea.

179
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,440
Your DNA doesn't match.

180
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,044
So you're not his biological father.

181
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,920
Mom!

182
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:23,020
(Grain Buds. Death Anniversary of Mom)

183
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,630
(Mom,)

184
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,350
(you said Lu Jianhua is my dad.)

185
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,160
(But he doesn't acknowledge me.)

186
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,360
(Tang Baozhu)
