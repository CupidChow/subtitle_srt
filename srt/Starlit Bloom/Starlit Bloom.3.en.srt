00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,060
=Starlit Bloom=

2
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,060
=Episode 3=

3
00:01:00,622 --> 00:01:01,400
Hello?

4
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,840
Ms. Gu. Someone is here to see you.

5
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,359
Who is it?

6
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,430
- Hey, beautiful. We meet again.
- Hang on a sec.

7
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,959
Sorry, Ms. Gu, I couldn't stop him.

8
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:12,159
I didn't expect you
to be the boss of GL.

9
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,000
Mr. Lu Xingchen,
I don't recall inviting you.

10
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:18,560
So this is the hospitality
at the company

11
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,111
that Tang Baozhu spoke so highly of.

12
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,799
Baozhu?

13
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,040
Hello, my bestie.

14
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,439
Xingchen.

15
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:30,879
This is your Aunt Liusu's company.

16
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,159
From now on,
if you need anything, talk to her.

17
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,519
Tang Baozhu, when did I ever say

18
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:40,719
- he could come to me about anything?
- Keep it up.

19
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,200
The elder wants the younger to work.

20
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,480
He doesn't want to join Xinghan.

21
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,280
So they keep fighting.

22
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,959
I just wanted to ease the tension,

23
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,079
so I made a suggestion.

24
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,840
But, the elder agreed.

25
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,920
Why are you so unmotivated?

26
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,280
You're a man, yet you have
no sense of responsibility.

27
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:02,000
If you're still like this,

28
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,439
go back to France.

29
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,120
I've already graduated.

30
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,519
I have the right
to live my life on my own terms.

31
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,189
I want to stay in China.

32
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,639
Why don't you cut off my credit cards?

33
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,719
From now on,
I won't need a penny from you.

34
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,199
Then go work at Xinghan.

35
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:15,199
No.

36
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,439
I'm not going to Xinghan.

37
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:17,800
Anywhere but there.

38
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,711
Anywhere else is fine.

39
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,680
Honey,

40
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,319
don't be mad.

41
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,039
How about letting him
try working with Liusu?

42
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:34,800
See,

43
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,800
they both studied design.

44
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,479
Their majors even match.

45
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,311
Most importantly,
she can keep an eye on him.

46
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,919
The kid is stubborn.

47
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,360
I'm afraid he won't agree.

48
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,840
Perfect.

49
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,680
Let his aunt discipline him properly.

50
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:47,639
Leave it to me.

51
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,639
Tang Baozhu,

52
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,639
you're not even his stepmother yet,

53
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:57,360
and you're already so invested.

54
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,159
Bestie,

55
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,599
you should know,

56
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,240
stepmothers and stepsons
have never gotten along.

57
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,800
Give me two months.

58
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,039
I'll win over Lu Xingchen,

59
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,439
get the wedding done smoothly,

60
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:08,080
and who knows, maybe next year

61
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,000
you'll be holding a little nephew.

62
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,560
I can't wait for that day.

63
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,240
Nope.

64
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,800
Not a chance.

65
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:18,360
If you want a kid,
you could have one first.

66
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,159
You really think Lu won't marry you?

67
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,759
I just don't want to wear
a wedding dress with a baby bump.

68
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,560
Besides...

69
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,000
Lu is already in his fifties.

70
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,560
Who knows if he can even manage it?

71
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,120
Tang Baozhu, what are you saying?

72
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,840
Don't be fooled by all the fighting
between them.

73
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,000
Deep down, he really treasures his son.

74
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,560
How about this?

75
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,080
No more than three chances.

76
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,560
Give him three shots.

77
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,840
If he messes up again,

78
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,639
I'll handle Lu myself.

79
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:47,120
Aren't you looking for a secretary?

80
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,000
You've already
been through 3,280 of them.

81
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,319
Why not let him
get some practice at your company?

82
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,439
Tang Baozhu,

83
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:55,319
you really want
your stepson to be my secretary?

84
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,960
How does that sound reasonable?

85
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,240
Perfectly reasonable.

86
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,759
What's with that look?

87
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:07,240
Are you rejecting me?

88
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,639
(Bestie...)

89
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,560
(I can't exactly tell you
that mediocre guy)

90
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,800
(is actually Lu Xingchen, can I?)

91
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,959
Just three chances.

92
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,800
You are the best.

93
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:27,399
Work hard.

94
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,480
Bye-bye.

95
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:31,680
(What are those two whispering about?)

96
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,800
(I can't do anything about her.)

97
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,800
Here's my resume.

98
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,160
Please check it.

99
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:50,509
Why so hostile?

100
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,155
Did you eat firecrackers for breakfast?

101
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,639
What you need to do now
is leave my desk.

102
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:01,560
Leaving.

103
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,160
And then?

104
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,839
Keep your distance from me.

105
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,560
I saw the security footage.

106
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,959
That night, actually...

107
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:19,639
Stop.

108
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,879
I don't want to hear another word

109
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:24,759
about that night.

110
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:28,079
Mr. Lu, just forget about it.

111
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,720
If you think something like that

112
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,720
can be tossed around casually,

113
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,000
then I don't mind letting people know

114
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:36,759
you really are just average.

115
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:42,319
Fine.

116
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,639
You refused to hear me out.

117
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,519
Don't blame me for not warning you.

118
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,360
Anyway,

119
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,160
I promised Baozhu

120
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,279
to keep you at the company.

121
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,759
But we'll set three rules.

122
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,839
First,

123
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,240
you are not allowed
to question any of my orders.

124
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,480
Second,

125
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,079
forget your old identity.

126
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,879
From today, you're just a secretary.

127
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:00,839
Third,

128
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:03,399
your flings outside are
none of my business,

129
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,240
but you cannot mess around
with my employees.

130
00:06:08,866 --> 00:06:10,070
Mess around with employees?

131
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,120
Flings?

132
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:16,120
Why does it sound like

133
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:20,040
you know me so well?

134
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,000
Are you going to read

135
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,560
my resume or not?

136
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,480
I'm really not that mediocre.

137
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,519
Take a look.

138
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,399
Fourth,

139
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,519
don't mess with Tang Baozhu again.

140
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,399
Xiaolu,

141
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:43,600
get our Secretary Lu

142
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,800
a desk

143
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,120
separate from the others.

144
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,399
Thanks.

145
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,720
Alright.

146
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,879
Secretary Lu, please come with me.

147
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,120
Off to work.

148
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,079
(It's actually pretty fun teasing her.)

149
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,519
What sin did I commit to deserve this?

150
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,839
I knew meeting him
would bring me bad luck!

151
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,199
How is Starry Sea's designer holding up?

152
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,399
We're handling it.

153
00:07:19,244 --> 00:07:20,630
She really is from your company?

154
00:07:20,911 --> 00:07:22,600
I thought it was just some rumor online.

155
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,120
The night I met Gu Liusu

156
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,680
wasn't what you think it was.

157
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,360
It probably looked messy...

158
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,279
Lu Xingchen!

159
00:07:40,777 --> 00:07:42,070
What are you two talking about?

160
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,040
Work stuff.

161
00:07:45,688 --> 00:07:46,750
Get me a glass of water.

162
00:07:48,444 --> 00:07:50,360
Ugh, I can't hear a word
of what they're saying.

163
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,000
Ms. Gu,

164
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,279
I've been here all morning.

165
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,519
Let me learn something useful.

166
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,000
Learn to shut up.

167
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,640
(Starry Sea line planned for next year
shot into the top three trends)

168
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,839
I saw the comments too.

169
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:05,600
You're getting roasted.

170
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,820
(426 comments)

171
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,800
If you can't say anything useful,
just keep quiet.

172
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:14,279
Ms. Gu.

173
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,079
Be honest with me.

174
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,399
Are you hitting menopause?

175
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,879
Menopause, huh?

176
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,319
I mean...

177
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,600
The outfit you're wearing today

178
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,399
makes you look just a little older.

179
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:36,960
Older, huh?

180
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,200
Why did you hit me?

181
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,519
Lu Xingchen, listen up.

182
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,159
This side is your work area.

183
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,519
That side is not.

184
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:44,039
From now on,

185
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,440
you can't cross that line in the middle
during work hours.

186
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,159
And another thing,

187
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,759
stop making
random comments about my clothes.

188
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,759
You're hilarious.

189
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,039
A woman actually left you half-dead.

190
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,519
She was a beast.

191
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:08,759
Three smacks and my head is swollen.

192
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:11,639
I don't get it.

193
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,679
There are so many companies out there.

194
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,559
Why'd you agree to work
for your stepmom's bestie?

195
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,519
The point is,

196
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,559
even after getting beaten up,
you still won't quit.

197
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,279
Either you're a masochist,

198
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,120
or you're doing it out of spite

199
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,200
for your dad.

200
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:33,320
You've been reading way too many novels.

201
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,519
I'm done talking.

202
00:09:34,577 --> 00:09:35,600
I'll check on the horse.

203
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,039
Shark!

204
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,159
(Is this really GL's new season?)

205
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:50,519
(GL thinks they can
fool people with this trash?)

206
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,919
(Even my mom wouldn't wear it.)

207
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:52,720
(Exactly.)

208
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,810
(And they call this the hottest design
for young people?)

209
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,240
(It's not the Qing dynasty anymore.)

210
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,200
(Do they not care
what we actually like anymore?)

211
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,039
(Customers are supposed to be king.)

212
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,080
You're here.

213
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,360
I came to pick up my meds.

214
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:24,000
How have you been lately?

215
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,360
Back on medication again.

216
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,440
The nightmares are getting worse too.

217
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,840
Is it because

218
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,960
Starry Sea got leaked early?

219
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:32,320
And the pressure is on you?

220
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,039
So you've seen the news too.

221
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:38,919
Feels like life's just
one tangled mess right now.

222
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,519
Don't try to shoulder everything
on your own.

223
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,799
That only makes your condition flare up.

224
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,799
I just want to do as much as I can.

225
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,799
So what do you want to do?

226
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,639
At the very least,

227
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:56,279
I need to see Starry Sea through.

228
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:00,000
Take a breath.

229
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,080
Think through the first step.

230
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:04,000
If you feel unstable,

231
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,533
remember deep breathing
and mindfulness meditation.

232
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:12,120
But I still hope

233
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,200
you'll cut out
those outside stressors too.

234
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:24,519
Thanks, Dr. Yu.

235
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:34,799
(GL released
an official statement yesterday.)

236
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:37,840
(Starry Sea was confirmed as
the work of Graceful Line's designer.)

237
00:11:37,866 --> 00:11:39,400
(Because the style is so different)

238
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,759
(from her previous works,
it stirred up heated debate online.)

239
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:42,360
(Today,)

240
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,399
(we've invited Graceful Line's founder,)

241
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,120
(Ms. Gu Liusu,)

242
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,639
(to answer netizens' questions.)

243
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:48,720
(Hello, I'm Gu Liusu.)

244
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,399
(Everyone's curious
about this mysterious designer.)

245
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:53,919
(Ms. Gu, why'd this season's
collection turn out like this?)

246
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:57,080
(The concept isn't
something I want to reveal just yet.)

247
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,600
(But the early leak lets us hear)

248
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:02,120
(people's voices more directly.)

249
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,799
(As for the designer...)

250
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:05,840
(Sadly, I have to tell you all,)

251
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,519
she passed away last week.

252
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,279
(To honor her memory)

253
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,200
(and show the true meaning
behind her work,)

254
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:16,200
(we're working hard
on refining the collection.)

255
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,440
Impossible.

256
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,754
Thank you, everyone.

257
00:12:19,755 --> 00:12:22,080
And thanks to Ms. Gu
for joining our live radio broadcast.

258
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,200
- This has been Express Radio...
- No way!

259
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,080
(I hope that
with everyone's encouragement,)

260
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,840
(our company can deliver
a good result.)

261
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,759
Why are you here?

262
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:33,600
Mr. Xingchen.

263
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,666
Your emergency contact number
in China is my phone.

264
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,200
Someone called me this morning.

265
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,799
They said you used
Shi Yue's Weibo

266
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,639
(Shi Yue: What did you post?)
to make a post looking for a designer.

267
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,519
The picture you used now
has copyright issues.

268
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:43,320
You're being sued.

269
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,977
(What did you post on my account?)

270
00:12:46,311 --> 00:12:48,400
(What's going on?)

271
00:12:48,444 --> 00:12:49,420
(Shi Yue: GL dragged me to their office,
saying they need evidence.)

272
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:50,679
Mr. Xingchen,

273
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:52,200
can you explain the whole story to me,

274
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,000
so I know how to help you fix this?

275
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,440
We're going to GL.

276
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,120
I really don't know anything, Officers.

277
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,360
I'm innocent.

278
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,000
Officers.

279
00:13:08,044 --> 00:13:09,080
Here are all the records

280
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,044
of our design drafts
from the first sketch to now,

281
00:13:11,044 --> 00:13:12,155
and the patent applications.

282
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:13,869
It really wasn't me.

283
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,244
It's a misunderstanding, Officers.

284
00:13:15,266 --> 00:13:17,480
Why would I waste time
stealing someone else's secrets?

285
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:18,720
Come on, just confess.

286
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,799
Who put you up to this?

287
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:22,679
Confess to what?

288
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:24,480
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

289
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,159
Fine.

290
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:26,600
Still playing dumb, huh?

291
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,109
Since you're so loyal to your master,

292
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,880
you can deal
with the consequences yourself.

293
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,519
Officer.

294
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,799
It was his Weibo post.

295
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:33,559
Look.

296
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,759
It's even verified.

297
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,039
Gu Liusu!

298
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,240
Lu Xingchen.

299
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,519
What exactly did you post?

300
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:41,039
Xiaolu.

301
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:41,480
Quiet.

302
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,999
- Is it true the designer's dead?
- Yes.

303
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:45,360
So you did post it?

304
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,919
Good, you're here.

305
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:49,039
Explain yourself.

306
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:56,919
How could this happen?

307
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,120
Isn't he the new secretary?

308
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,240
How'd he stir up such a mess?

309
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,919
Wait till Ms. Gu gets here
and see how it's handled.

310
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,150
They say your dad is
landing a big project.

311
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,799
Hand over some more cash.

312
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,150
Didn't I give you money last time?

313
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,279
How dare you talk back?

314
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:15,149
Stop right there!

315
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,570
Try saying that outside, I dare you!

316
00:14:16,577 --> 00:14:17,790
Picking on kids, huh?
