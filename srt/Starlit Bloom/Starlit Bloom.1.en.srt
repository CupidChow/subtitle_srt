1
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:40,479
Clean it.

2
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:47,079
I'll clean it for you.

3
00:00:47,511 --> 00:00:49,240
I didn't know you offered this service.

4
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,200
Customer is queen.

5
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,560
Madam, are you awake?

6
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,480
(What?)

7
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,359
(It's him.)

8
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,280
Drink up!

9
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:44,540
You lost again.

10
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,319
Bottoms up!

11
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,200
(I barely drink any.)

12
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:54,799
(Why do I feel so wasted?)

13
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,239
(I should get freshened up.)

14
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,920
Shi Yue, where are you?

15
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,959
What's my glasses doing here?

16
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,159
Come on! Drink up!

17
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,400
Come on.

18
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,479
Hurry.

19
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,360
Have a drink.

20
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:18,800
You call this a drink?

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,919
Get a bigger shot!

22
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:24,719
Drink up.

23
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:25,520
Drink.

24
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,360
Another one.

25
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:32,639
I caught you.

26
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,599
Glasses thief.

27
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,159
Pretty lady, you got it all wrong.

28
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,400
These are my glasses.

29
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,280
These are your glasses.

30
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,680
Come on!

31
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,599
Same model. It must be fate.

32
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,319
Have a drink.

33
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,360
Let's be friends.

34
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:57,280
What fate?

35
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,800
Is she your client?

36
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,439
You'd rather drink with her and not me?

37
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,280
(Client?)

38
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,240
Excuse me.

39
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,080
Carry on.

40
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,280
Why are you leaving?

41
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,919
Forget her.

42
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:14,800
Come on.

43
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,680
I'll drink with you.

44
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,960
Where were you just now?

45
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:21,960
The restroom.

46
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:22,560
Come on.

47
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:23,639
Here.

48
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:24,319
Drink up!

49
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,680
Come on!

50
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,960
(Drinking Wine, Dancing Night)

51
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,120
Not bad.

52
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,240
Another shot!

53
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,840
(The youngsters' flirting skills
are less than underwhelming these days.)

54
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,199
(What a joke.)

55
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,639
(Did he)

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,439
(just call me his client?)

57
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,199
Had a nice sleep?

58
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,240
Hmm?

59
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,039
Do you really have to stare at me?

60
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,319
Breakfast is ready.

61
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:04,879
(Oh my.)

62
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:06,639
(This can't be more wrong.)

63
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:09,680
(How did I end up with a host?)

64
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:10,866
Over there.

65
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,199
(Of the 36 strategies,)

66
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,240
(fleeing is the sound one.)

67
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,839
It's not much to borrow an outfit.

68
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,519
My shirt got dirty.

69
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,480
I need to borrow this.

70
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:36,000
Certainly, Madam.

71
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:39,879
Are you

72
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:40,879
actually

73
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:41,839
the host?

74
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,439
How do you know?

75
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:49,240
But I don't like that title here.

76
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:50,519
You may call me Lu Xingchen.

77
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,519
The outfit looks good on you.

78
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,639
I'll pay up at the club.

79
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:56,720
Consider this outfit bought.

80
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,160
Don't get wasted if you can't handle it.

81
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,279
And how would you make money
if people don't drink?

82
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,199
We don't make a lot selling alcohol.

83
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,480
What we sell

84
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,040
is the service package.

85
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,639
It's not worth flexing.

86
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,800
Satisfying every client

87
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:17,920
is our motto.

88
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:21,160
(He seems proud of his job.)

89
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:26,000
Why do I get this feeling

90
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,920
that you look familiar?

91
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,888
Is this the typical playboy troupe?

92
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,720
So frosty.

93
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,777
Someone broke your heart?

94
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:39,040
You keep your clients' info
confidential, right?

95
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,439
Certainly.

96
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,466
The door is over there.

97
00:05:48,488 --> 00:05:49,555
Sorry.

98
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:56,560
(Clyton)
(I am Gu Liusu.)

99
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,600
(I am 30 this year.)

100
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,720
(I founded the hit jewelry brand
known as Graceful Line.)

101
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,160
(Due to my being pretty,
capable, and single,)

102
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,480
(there are plenty of bad comments
about my character.)

103
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,759
(The gossip is not unlike
the accident last night.)

104
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,079
(They won't hinder my pace.)

105
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:12,319
(However,)

106
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,920

109
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,439
Ms. Gu, you are right on time.

110
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,000
It seems I have a stalker here.

111
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,600
Nice outfit.

112
00:06:26,355 --> 00:06:29,111
The president of OA Jewelry wants to
book next month's haute couture.

113
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:31,120
No.

114
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,560
Ms. Gu, please sign this.

115
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,240
Ms. Gu, your latte.

116
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,199
Leave it in my office.

117
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,360
Okay.

118
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,600
Morning meeting in 15 minutes.

119
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:37,839
Okay.

120
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,360
Okay, Ms. Gu.

121
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:38,879

(My Bestie)

139
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,399
Where were you yesterday?

140
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,720
You didn't even answer my calls.

141
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,079
Don't you love me anymore?

142
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,959
Were you with a guy?

I am your bestie, you know.

146
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,560
Spill it.

147
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:48,160
The truth is, I got drunk last night.

148
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,879
I forgot all the important stuff.

149
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,079
No way!

150
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,000
Was he...

151
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,639
that mediocre?

152
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,680
Can someone mediocre even do that?

153
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,439
Do what?

154
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:01,959
A host.

155
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:03,000
A what?

156
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,399
Why were you messing
with a guy like that?

157
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,920
That really was an accident.

158
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,800
It is a bit unlucky though.

159
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,600
Let me rescue you.

160
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,519
The day after tomorrow
is my engagement party.

161
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,720
By then, all the guests will be
from powerful families.

162
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,000
I'll introduce you
to some top-tier suitors.

166
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,120
Fine.

167
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,120
I'll stop here.

168
00:08:34,888 --> 00:08:35,911
Meeting.

I have been ready for a long time.

174
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:47,360
Then let's go.

175
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,159
And your son?
Have you settled things with him?

176
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:53,120
Relax, he'll definitely be there.

177
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:03,919
Mr. Xingchen.

178
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:05,320
I'm from Xinghan Group.

179
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,590
Your father's personal assistant.

180
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,559
My name is Mo Li.

181
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,240
Mr. Lu instructed me

182
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,222
to take you
to pick out your suit for the party.

183
00:09:11,222 --> 00:09:12,066
I'm not going.

184
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,619
I told you,

185
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,050
I don't want to see that gold digger.

186
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,869
(Mo Li)
Having a wedding for a second marriage?

187
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,711
(Secretary of the President)
She should be embarrassed.

188
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,639
Leave the chores to the servants.

189
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,279
Leave it to them.

190
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:23,200
Perfect.

191
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,879
Do me a favor.

192
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,240
Your father said

193
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,519
the engagement party
will be full of elites.

194
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,777
He also wants you to meet them early.

195
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:36,440
Meet them?

196
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:38,440
(Lu Xingchen)
It is his own engagement party.

197
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,630
(Heir of Xinghan Group)
Yet, it carries his personal agendas.

198
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:41,639
Pathetic, right?

199
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,679
Anyway,

200
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,960
from now on, all matters of you
taking over Xinghan Group

201
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,679
will be handled by me.

202
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,759
Mr. Mo, you really are dedicated.

203
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:55,840
I've passed on the message.

204
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,320
There is work to be done.

205
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,120
I'll go now.

206
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,333
I'm not scolding you.

207
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:11,879
Mr. Xingchen, a message for you.

208
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,440
(Shi Yue: Xingchen,)

209
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,840
(news of your dad remarrying)

210
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,519
(is all over town now.)

211
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:20,720
The address for the fitting...

212
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,080
Did he leave it?

213
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,600
He did, Mr. Xingchen.

214
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,120
Take me there later.

215
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,759
Alright.

216
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:32,559
(So eager to invite me?)

217
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,377
(I'll go meet this gold digger myself.)

218
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,980
(Lu Jianhua and Tang Baozhu)

219
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,000
Mr. Li.

220
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,399
Mr. Lu.

221
00:10:46,177 --> 00:10:47,080
Congratulations, Mr. Lu.

222
00:10:47,088 --> 00:10:47,822
Please come inside.

223
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:50,679
Mr. Lu.

224
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,159
Did Xingchen get the notice?

225
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,759
Yeah, he did.

226
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,480
That kid has been running wild abroad.

227
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,639
Now that he is back,

228
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,279
you'll need to teach him some manners.

229
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,759
Don't worry, Mr. Lu.

230
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,711
I'll make sure he learns.

231
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:08,799
Mr. Lu.

232
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:09,389
Hello.

233
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,239
Congratulations.

234
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,133
Congratulations, Mr. Lu.

235
00:11:11,155 --> 00:11:12,800
- Please come inside.
- Alright, let's go.

236
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,088
The preparations were rushed.

237
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,320
I've explained everything.

238
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:45,240
A cynical rich kid, huh?

239
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:46,440
I'm basically

240
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:48,120
just playing myself, right?

241
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:50,840
Our mission is...

242
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,133
To take down the gold digger.

243
00:11:52,155 --> 00:11:53,200
Our goal is...

244
00:11:53,288 --> 00:11:54,311
To seduce Tang Baozhu.

245
00:11:54,355 --> 00:11:55,679
I memorized her dress design.

246
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,550
We'll act accordingly.

247
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:57,039
Okay.

248
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:57,440
Let's go.

249
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,200
Mr. Xingchen.

250
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:02,399
There are a lot of guests tonight.

251
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,039
Be sure to behave properly.

252
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,360
What are you, a cop?

253
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:07,279
Don't be nosy.

254
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,440
When does the party start?

255
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,840
In about...

256
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,360
Half an hour.

257
00:12:20,622 --> 00:12:21,270
Congratulations.

258
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,639
Thanks for coming today.

259
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,840
You look absolutely stunning.

260
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:27,000
Bestie.

261
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,399
Bestie!

262
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:30,679
You finally made it!

263
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,000
Of course I'd come.

264
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,080
If I didn't, someone else
would've stolen my bestie.

265
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,799
No way that would happen.

266
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,279
Are you here for my wedding

267
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,399
or to mourn me?

268
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,279
What are you saying?

269
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:43,720
Touch wood.

270
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:44,720
Don't jinx it.

271
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,279
I have another dress.

272
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:47,279
Go change into it.

273
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,720
Tang Baozhu.

274
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,933
You're the one getting engaged,

275
00:12:49,933 --> 00:12:52,080
so why should I steal the spotlight?

276
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,400
It's fine. I like it this way.

277
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,133
Bestie.

278
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,399
Did you forget our childhood promise?

279
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,919
We said we'd be the prettiest ones
at each other's engagement party.

280
00:13:00,622 --> 00:13:01,720
I look pretty good, don't I?

281
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,733
Go on, hurry!

282
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,039
Alright, alright.

283
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:04,720
Where is it?

284
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,440
Over there.

285
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:07,519
Quick, go.

286
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,377
The black widow style,
with the pearl gown.

287
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,919
She is the one.

288
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:16,919
Tang Baozhu.

289
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:18,759
I won't allow you to marry Lu Jianhua!

290
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:19,879
I am in love with you!

291
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,720
(They are here for Baozhu?)

292
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:32,039
