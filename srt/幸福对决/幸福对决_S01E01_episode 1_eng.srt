 - No, something else.

75
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,640
- How about a spicy rice bowl?
 - Korean braised chicken!

76
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,780
- Spicy stir-fried pork.
 - Yes!

77
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,820
No, no, no.

78
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,910
- Why not?
 - We had that yesterday.

79
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,910
 -We can have it again. 
 - Yeah, we can have it again.

00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,460
 Didn't we have the soy sauce version?

81
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,160
 Why do we always have stir-fried pork?

You have such great taste, Madam.

 I made a snack for Ji Yool and Ha Yool on this nice day.

91
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:34,380
 It's worth the hard work. My babies don't eat if it's not pretty.

You're good at everything, Yool's Mom!

Where did you get that marriage edition plate?

96
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,510

So talented! Your taste is at another level!

97
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,120
Gosh, I get it wrong every time.

98
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,910
Madam, your meal's ready.

99
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,180
You can have it, Ajumeoni.

100
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,080
You're here? Come in.

101
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,580
You always bring me things. I feel so bad.

102
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,440
Don't even say that.

103
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,530
We're friends. Of course, I can make some snacks for Min Seong.

104
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:24,990
I just feel like all I do is receive from you all the time.

105
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,530
It's so yummy.

106

Oh, yeah!

108
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:48,920
I bought this for Ji Yool and Ha Yool while I was at the mall.

109
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,850
Who else would do this if not me?

110
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:54,010
They're so pretty.

111
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,240
I'm the one receiving today, not you.

112
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,040
It's all about give and take.

113
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,760
Of course.

114
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,790
Ta-da!

115
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:07,810
My goodness! They're so pretty!

116
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,910
Wow, did you make all this, Eonni?

117
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,810
Of course, I did.

118
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:16,660
Geez, why hassle making these when you could just buy them?

119
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,040
The quality is completely different.

120
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,690
You can't buy these even if you want to.

121
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,560
Eonni! Let's take a picture.

122
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,270
Wow, I should show this to my husband.

123
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,010
How does it look?

124
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,960
Daebak! I got a good one.

125
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,210
I'll see you later downstairs, Eonni.

She's been like this all day.

146
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,720
Come on, Ella.

147
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,400
Come out here.

148
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,470
You had a lot of fun playing hide and seek with Dad yesterday, huh?

149
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,500
Did you also want to play hide and seek with your teacher?

150
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,700
Do you want to go outside and play with your friends?

151
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,840
You go first. Mommy's coming, too.

Okay.

Ms. Jo Ah Ra, is Ji Yool doing well?

154
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,710
Ji Yool's very upright and smart, so there's no worry.

155
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,580
But actually...

156
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,240
Ji Yool seems a bit depressed these days.

157
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,590
I think you need to look out for her at home.

158
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:12,440
She doesn't have any problems at home.

159
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,440
- I think the kindergarten should pay closer attention. 
 - Pardon?

160
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,380
It's been two years since you've been a helper teacher, right?

161
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:24,190
I know you're learning along with the children.

162
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:28,830
But you should still be on top of taking care of the children.

163
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,730
- Ji Yool.
 - Mom!

164
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,960
Hello, parents.

165
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,550
Welcome to today's meeting.

166
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:45,350
The reason we called you in

167
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:50,010
is to tell you about the decision we've made about the performance.

168
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,210
- Sorry, I'm late.
 - Mom!

169
00:11:54,570 --> 00:12:00,430
This performance will be at the LS Art Center and there will be a collaboration with an orchestra.

170
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:03,710
We'll be performing the "Red Shoes" musical in English.

171
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,700
"Red Shoes."

172
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,870
It's a musical, a musical.

173
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,060
Performing where?

174
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,600
We'll pick the main role through a simple audition.

175
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,660
The Snow Princess role

176
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:18,080
will be followed exclusively by a professional cameraman.

177
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,280
Wow, must be nice.

178
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,490
Our kids must love it, but...

179
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:26,410
I wonder if the boys will like it, too,

180
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,920
since the main role is a girl.

181
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:34,250
The principal must've thought it through.

182
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,860
She probably considered fairness, too.

183
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:40,470
We did "Jack and the Beanstalk" last year.

184
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:45,140
But wouldn't it be advantageous for someone who sings well?

185
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:51,690
Maybe I should ask my husband to send her to a musical school or...take vocal lessons.

186
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:54,780
Aigoo, please don't worry, mothers.

187
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:58,030
Costume, singing, acting, and proactiveness.

188
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,220
We'll be considering various aspects.

189
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,860
So it must be very fair.

190
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,650
Since an audition is the fairest method—

191
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:08,580
I ask that you  absolutely  guarantee the fairness of the audition this time.

192
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:13,330
We can't let what happened two years ago happen again.

193
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,630
You don't need to worry about that.

194
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,480
The auditions will be professionally judged.

195
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,210
The scores of each category will be announced as well.

196
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,660
I know there'll be a lot of opinions.

197
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:32,650
I ask for your cooperation in making a successful performance, mothers.

198
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,920
Of course!

199
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,460
It's a performance for all of us to enjoy. Right?

200
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:42,030
Aigoo, I don't know who'll be the Snow Princess,

201
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,200
but that mom will have a lot to do.

202
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:49,580
Right. Singing practice, acting practice, and costume preparations.

203
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,410
It won't be easy for the mom, either.

204
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:55,160
Count me out!

205
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,280
Am I the only one who thinks that?

206
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,310
I wonder if something's about to go down.

207
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:10,510
You wonder? Something's definitely going down.

208
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:13,080
I wonder what'll happen this time.

209
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,220
What's wrong? Did something happen last time?

210
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:19,690
Well, I guess you don't know since it was before you joined.

211
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:23,270
There was a kid model selection two years ago.

212
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:26,470
So Won got selected but had to do the audition again.

213
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,660
Why?

214
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,260
You know that Ji Yool has a severe peanut allergy, right?

215
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:35,900
Apparently, someone gave Ji Yool a peanut candy the day before the audition.

216
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,970
In the end, they said something about audition fairness and whatnot.

217
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,920
All the moms were in an uproar.

218
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,900
Oh, really?

219
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,440
That must've been crazy.

220
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,510
So, who got it? Ji Yool?

221
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:50,080
No, it was a child who doesn't go here anymore.

222
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,640
They were forced out.

223
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,380
That must be the pizza.

224
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,840
 Our kids must love it, but...

225
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,950
 I wonder if the boys will like it, too, since the main character is a girl.

226
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:28,480
 But wouldn't it be advantageous for someone who sings well?

227
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,300
 Maybe I should ask my husband to send her to a musical school...

228
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,470
 or take vocal lessons.

229
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,330
Mom, why are you smiling?

230
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,310
Because it's funny.

231
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:47,010
Mom, let's do "Peter Pan" instead of "Red Shoes."

232
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,390
- "Peter Pan"?
 - Yeah!

233
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,310
I'll become Peter Pan and get Captain Hook—

234
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,960
Ji Yool. Why are you talking about Peter Pan right now?

235
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,410
You need to focus on Snow Princess.

236
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:02,910
Ji Yool, I want to do Snow Princess.

237
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:08,310
No— Ji Yool, you'll be Snow Princess.

238
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,110
Everyone will be jealous when I post it on social media.

239
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:14,850
I'm happy just thinking about it. Aren't you?

240
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,820
These are the first-round selections.

241
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:23,150
I'll sort and score each category, then make the final selection.

242
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,450
Let's see. Big family portraits here.

243
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,390
- Give multicultural families to Mr. Go.
 - Okay.

244
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,680
I'll put the influencers here.

245
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,400
 Oh Yu Jin

246
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:45,190
What? Do you know her?

247
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:48,280
First love? Or a friend?

248
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,730
Or the friend who stole your first love?

249
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,020
The offender...

250
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:58,140
What?

251
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,700
N-Nothing. I was just speaking nonsense.

252
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,960
Who's the offender? The woman? Or the guy?

253
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,400
Yeah, tell us the story, Assistant Manager Jang.

254
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,940
I think it's the woman.

255
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:11,270
This woman definitely stole her first love.

256
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,710
- Go already.
 - Pardon?

257
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,810
Don't you have plans?

258
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:55,830
Give it to me and leave. I'd be more comfortable working without you here.

259
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,770
How could I do that?

260
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:00,950
I know you've been wanting to leave.

261
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,560
Don't you want to leave?

262
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,280
 Sangjin High Soccer, Lee Jeong Wu

263
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:16,010
I'm sorry. It's been a really long time since I attended a reunion.

264
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:29,240
But Assistant Manager Jang, this isn't just out of mere curiosity.

265
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,410
And it does bother me,

266
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,810
especially since you don't talk about your personal life.

267
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:40,595
- Oh Yu Jin— 
 - Go, you'll be late.

268
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,310
Yes.

269
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,750
Turn the lights off.

270
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:08,520
 My bubbles keep popping.

271
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,340
I think I'll get smaller and smaller.

272
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:54,170
♫  When I forced my eyes open  ♫

273
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:01,740
♫  I was still alone  ♫

274
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:10,560
♫  The same days I couldn't get used to  ♫

275
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:17,100
♫  In the end, I'm right back where I started  ♫

276
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:26,110
♫  Today is always a little colder than yesterday  ♫

277
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:33,230
♫  Since tomorrow is always so far away  ♫

278
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,040
She hasn't changed one bit.

279
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:42,220
♫  Everyone in this trembling world  ♫

280
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:46,120
Never mind, she's changed a lot.

281
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:59,370
♫  With small cowering shoulders, I look for someone's arms to fall asleep in  ♫

282
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:02,230
 DGB Financial Group

283
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,990
Well then...

284
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:10,840
You can call these people, Ms. Jang.

285
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,300
No.

286
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,130
I'll call these people.

287
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:21,600
What's with this? Is this really because of Oh Yu Jin? 
 Oh Yu Jin

288
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,440
Don't cross the line.

289
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:30,100
Congratulations, customer Mr. Park Han Il.

290
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,400
 Park Han Il

291
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:37,560
Gosh, what a crazy day.

292
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,860
Assistant Manager Jang, have you made the final selection?

293
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,890
I've made my calls, but Associate Manager Lee hasn't yet.

294
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,890
Associate Manager Lee went to support the Young Frontier event. Let's hurry it up.

295
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:48,050
- When Associate Manager Lee comes— 
- Hey.

296
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:50,110
Make the calls now and finish it.

297
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,200
I won't repeat myself.

298
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,120
 Oh Yu Jin

299
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,900
 Yes, hello?

300
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:28,280
Hello, this is Assistant Manager Jang Jang Mi Ho of DG Bank Digital Division.

301
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,650
 Yes, and?

302
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,970
I'm Assistant Manager Jang Jang Mi Ho...

303
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:39,140
 Yes, go ahead.

304
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,870
The awards ceremony will be next month.

305
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:52,550
 - As soon as the date's set— 
 - Gosh, why bother me with this?

306
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:55,800
I applied for it because of the exclusive home shopping brands.

307
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,830
Anyway, I got it. I'm busy right now, so call back later.

308
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,230
Start.

309
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,180
Thank you so much, ma'am.

310
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,940
I suddenly asked you to extend your hours.

311
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:25,190
No worries. I'd be happy if you came to my performance. You're coming, right?

312
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,830
Of course, I definitely will.

313
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,860
 Hold it, please!

314
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,100
Thank you.

315
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:51,930
 Kim Na Yeong

316
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,980
 Kim Na Young

317
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:00,680
 Designer Jena Yu

318
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,540
Ji Yool, play with the helper for a bit.

319
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,270
Okay.

320
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,700
 Kim Na Yeong

321
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:54,790

00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,840
Yes, Eonni.

323
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:06,040
Ji Yool's not feeling well today, so I won't be able to attend.

324
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,930
I'm sorry.

325
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,060
She's avoiding it on purpose.

326
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:18,020
We should get started.

327
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:21,340
I rewrote the script.

328
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,960
Focus, please.

329
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,150
This performance isn't just about Snow Princess.

330
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,690
Let's not focus on one thing.

331
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,370
We need to see the bigger picture.

332
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:34,780
I increased the screen time for the princes.

333
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,010
When did you rewrite all this?

334
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:40,840
Of course, a CEO sure is different when it comes to getting things done.

335
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,670
I got a bit of help.

336
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,230
Your employees did all the hard work.

337
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:47,330
The princes break the curse of being dwarves.

338
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:50,690
You can say I added a plot where they rescue the Snow Princess.

339
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:53,340
O-Oh, no, I'm so sorry.

340
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:01,310
If you all agree with the new script, I'll submit it to the principal.

341
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,770
What do you all think?

342
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:05,300
What's there to say? Everyone agrees.

343
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,590
C-Could I have some more salad?

344
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:12,190
The reason I came to this meeting, using my lunch break,

345
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:14,460
is because of the fairness of the audition.

346
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:18,330
I hope we can talk about that, too.

347
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:24,970
So Won's mom has brought up something important.

348
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:27,230
Fairness.

349
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:31,610
The distribution of the main cast should be fair, don't you think?

350
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,300
 Kim Na Yeong

351
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:20,820
♫ This is the start of something so right ♫

352
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:31,090
♫ This is the start of something so right ♫

353
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,750
Ji Yool, let's do it one more time.

354
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,940
Again?

355
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,620
You need to memorize the lyrics.

356
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,510
♫ This is the start... ♫

357
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:45,600
 My Ji Yool, who sings so hard throughout the day.

358
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,430
 She practices so diligently without taking any classes.

359
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:51,310
 The "Red Shoes" musical performance.

360
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:54,750
 Please look forward to "Snow Princess Ji Yool."

361
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,200

Will Ji Yool be Snow Princess?

362
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,500
 Your online aunt is cheering you on!

363
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,280
 Ji Yool's voice is so clear.

364
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:06,810
 But I wonder if Ji Yool can fill the whole stage on her own.

365
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,900
 Since she's shorter than her peers.

366
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,490
 Ji Yool's voice sounds rough, like a man.

367
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:16,370
 Maybe you made her practice too much.

368
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,300
 My Min Seong looks like a real prince.

369
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,450
 The way he swings his sword is amazing.

370
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:30,480
 I look forward to seeing Min Seong's work in next year's presentation!

371
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,880
 Gosh, she's so bright!

372
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,750
 Red suits her perfectly!

373
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,440
 I wonder how much prettier she'll be in the Snow Princess costume.

374
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,300
 Ah Rin looks so pretty.

375
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:42,250
 But I don't think red is Ah Rin's personal color.

376
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:48,570
Make sure to register your vacations with HR this week.

377
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:51,540
 This is Assistant Manager Jang Mi Ho of DG Bank Digital Division.

378
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,770
 Yes, and?

379
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:55,380

- This is Assistant Manager Jang Mi Ho.  
- Give it to Ms. Jang today.

380
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,700
 Gosh, why bother me with this?

381
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,580
 I applied for it because of the exclusive home shopping brands.

382
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,890
Ms. Jang, you prepare the monthly report.

383
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:03,510
 I'm busy right now, so call back later.

384
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,100
 How did she not know it was me? Did she forget? Bitch.  
And for Home Sweet Home...

385
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,060
Aigoo, it's Ms. Jang again.

386
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,370
 Bitch

387
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:12,780
Ms. Jang, do you have some good ideas?

388
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:16,160
For the Home Sweet Home Family Portrait event winners.

389
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,290
Team Leader...

390
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:24,290
How about doing a photo shoot with one of the event winners?

391
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:28,090
For magazine publication, app, and cafe exposure.

392
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:31,140
- With the grand prize winner?
 - No.

393
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,780
The winner from the influencers. Ms. Oh Yu Jin.

394
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:41,640
If we vlog the photoshoot process on Oh Yu Jin's social media,

395
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,090
it'll be good advertising.

396
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:46,410
Not just having an event,

397
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:49,790
but if there are more follow-up activities with the event winner,

398
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:53,080
I think the vice president will like it since there'll be a lot of content for the media.

399
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,060
Oh, that sounds good.

400
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:58,940
But wouldn't the grand prize winner be better than Oh Yu Jin?

401
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:03,170
Do that with the grand prize winner. Take charge with Associate Manager Lee. Okay?

402
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,860
A-All of a sudden like this?

403
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:07,340
Team Leader, if you want to do effective advertising on SNS,

404
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,310
isn't Oh Yoo Jin better as an influencer?

405
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:11,340
We have to consider fairness.

406
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,630
Let's take care of it within this week.

407
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,910
Assistant Manager... A-Assistant Manager...

408
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:20,750
This stupid vending machine!

409
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,730
It stole my money! Again!

410
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:29,270
We're already overworking.

411
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:33,110
Even if we're just worker bees, isn't this just too much?

412
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:36,530
You're right. I've done it again.

413
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:39,050
Do you like work that much?

414
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:41,940
At this rate, I'll be stuck in office purgatory with you.

415
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,950
Gosh, I really can't do the photoshoot.

416
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,570
Don't worry, I'll do that.

417
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:48,850
Hey, that's—

418
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,820
Ms. Jang?

419
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:57,760
How do you know Oh Yu Jin?

420
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:08,470
You look like someone who's not over your crappy ex.

421
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,940
Quit writing novels.

422
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,280
Not a novel...

423
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,210
Gosh, when am I going to finish the report?

424
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:21,350
Aren't you going in?

425
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:23,800
Go ahead, I'll come in later.

426
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,530
Okay.

427
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:50,540
 Oh Yu Jin

428
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,900
Why did I save this?

429
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:06,820
♫ This is start! ♫

430
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:10,730
I don't want to do this!

431
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:21,100
♫ This is the start of something so right ♫

432
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:26,290
♫ Suddenly all of the stars have aligned ♫

433
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:31,410
♫ In the right place, at the right time ♫

434
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:37,150
♫ This is the start of something so right ♫

435
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:43,060
 Good job!

436
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,450
All right, kids, let's all go outside!

437
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:57,030
 Yes!

438
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,540
Bye.

439
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,010
Gosh, I have big expectations.

440
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:04,930
Looks like Ji Yool will make the performance shine.

441
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:07,080
I'm counting on you, Ji Yool's mom.

442
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,280
Principal, you made the right decision.

443
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,650
Increasing the prince's role was a stretch to begin with.

444
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:17,090
Snow's an independent woman.

445
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:19,870
My opinion is to break away from the old way of thinking.

446
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:23,720
Thank you for accepting it so willingly.

447
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,660
Of course.

448
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,040
Congratulations!

449
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,370
- Congratulations!
 - Congratulations, Ji Yool!

450
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:30,280
Who could compete with Ji Yool?

451
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:33,050
Gosh, don't mention it. Your daughter did well, too.

452
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:36,200
Which is why she got the Regina role.

453
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,610
Does anyone have time today?

454
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,110
I do, why?

455
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:43,010
I want to treat you to the Arforet Hotel pool.

456
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:47,670
We should talk about how Ji Yool will work together with the other roles.

457
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,990
Oh, really?

458
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:52,530
We would love to.

459
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,960
You're coming, right, Na Yeong?

460
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:58,620
Sorry, I have plans.

461
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:03,330
- Then—
 - Could my So Won come instead?

462
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:06,680
Which role did So Won get?

463
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,870
Big bunny?

464
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:11,180
Of course.

465
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:14,050
I'll see you all later at the pool.

466
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,560
Bye.

467
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,960
See you there.

468
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,220
 You did so well!

469
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,100
So Won, are you upset?

470
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,650
I sang really well.

471
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:43,480
You did. You were much better, So Won.

472
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,710
Two years ago and today.

473
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:54,360
But So Won, is it true what you said about the peanut?

474
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,510
I mean, does it make sense there's no CCTV in front of my door?

475
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,670
Of course, it makes sense.

476
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:02,080
At the end of last year, because of the invasion of privacy issue,

477
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,000
more than half of the residents agreed to get rid of them.

478
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,640
What about my stolen delivery?

479
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,290
That was ages ago. Why are you coming to us now?

480
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:23,620
You saw, right? They got off the 10th floor.

481
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,170
There, replay it.

482
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,980
Stop! Stop.

483
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,960
See! She looked at my delivery!

484
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,990
How can you be sure about that?

485
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:39,730
Looking doesn't mean stealing.

486
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:44,700
Gosh, you said you're changing the CCTV. When are you ever doing that?

487
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,420
You can't even see her face!

488
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:49,380
I'm going to tell my husband everything!

489
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,940
Hold on. Right there!

490
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:58,500
R-Right there. Can you zoom in?

491
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,400
 From Me, From You

492
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,460
  Wait!

493
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,190
Eonni!

494
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,190
Are you just going to sit and watch?

495
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:20,590
I think this eonni stole Ah Rin's outfit!

496
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:24,110
You're bringing that up now?

497
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:26,100
No, her method.

498
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:30,320
Her method's not fair!

499
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,080
My honey wouldn't let this go if he knew about it.

500
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,730
"My honey, my husband," whenever you say something.

501
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:38,840
Stop that. Are you the only one with a husband?

502
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:42,280
And why? Do you want to redo the audition?

503
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,840
Oh Yu Jin at least had a reason two years ago.

504
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,830
What reason do you have?

505
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:49,040
The teachers put in a lot of work this time.

506
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,940
Can't you tell by how they put Lee Jeong Hwa's student as the audition judge?

507
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,100
Lee Jeong Hwa?

508
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,540
 From Me, From You

509
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:03,430
What? Didn't take any lessons?

510
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,640
Whoa, Eonni!

511
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,780
I think Ji Yool got lessons from Lee Jeong Hwa. 
 - What?

512
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:15,210
In the CCTV, Yu Jin had a pamphlet for Lee Jeong Hwa's performance!

513
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:17,120
Unbelievable.

514
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:22,680
Wow, wasn't the result of the audition already set from the start?

515
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,190
It's not enough yet.

516
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:27,960
We'll get brushed off if we charge in without evidence.

517
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,520
Oh Yu Jin has a lot more followers than you.

518
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,320
So, are you just going to let it go?

519
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:37,890
No, we'll need to take action when things start to fall apart.

520
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:39,420
 Pass!

521
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:43,280
Nice pass!

522
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,830
So Won, come here.

523
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:47,000
 Picture-perfect Ji Yool and Ha Yool.

524
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,640
 Look at their happy faces.

525
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,750
 My Ji Yool's been chosen as Snow Princess.

526
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:55,930
 Arforet Hotel pool, happiness is all about sharing.

527
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,000

Wow, so jealous!

528
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,190

Let's come together next time.

529
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:04,720
Oh, my gosh! Look at the time.

530
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,670
We should feed the kids some snacks.

531
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:10,230
Ji Hye! Could you order some snacks for the kids? 
 - Sure!

532
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:14,640
Can I have two chicken tenders and two fries?

533
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,410
 Chicken Tender 20,000 won, Sweet Crispy Fried Chicken 25,000 won

534
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:19,020
And two sweet, crispy fried chicken.

535
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,020
All right.

536
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:47,770
- Kids, come and eat snacks! 
- Okay!

537
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:51,650
Everyone, come on out.

538
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:53,850
I'll get you a towel, Ji Yool.

539
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:57,080
Ha Yool, you, too.

540
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,790
Good.

541
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:05,790
- Mom!
 - One second.

542
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:08,130
There. Good job!

543
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:10,080
Mom!

544
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,300

miho_jang726 has started following you. 
 How is it? Is it good?

545
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:16,540
 miho_jang726

546
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,720
Mi Ho Jang?

 Hello.

548
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:22,400
 This is Assistant Manager Jang Mi Ho of DG Bank Digital Division.

549
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,120
 Yes, go ahead.

550
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,515
 I'm Assistant Manager Jang Mi Ho.

551
00:39:26,515 --> 00:39:28,225
 miho_jang726

552
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:49,110
Gosh. Eat slowly.

553
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:51,160
Ji Yool, are you okay?

554
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,800
Ji Yool!

555
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,800
What's going on?

556
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,750
I think there are peanuts in here.

557
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:10,580
I think Ji Yool didn't know and ate it.

558
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,830
Who ordered this! Huh?

559
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,020
Oh, no! I forgot.

560
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,360
Are you crazy?

561
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,180
Are you trying to kill her?

562
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,960
Oh, no...

563
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,250
Get up. Let's go to the hospital.

564
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:43,810
Didn't you say Ji Yool had really bad peanut allergies?

565
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:48,430
I think you said her throat swells right away.

566
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:05,910
- Let's go to the hospital.
 - Why?

567
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:18,360
Why would you eat that? You should've spit it out.

568
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,040
Why? I don't think I have allergies.

569
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,060
No! You have allergies! You do!

570
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:46,730
 Bannae Go Eun Dermatologist

571
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,700
 Ji Yool ate peanuts.

572
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,200
 She's being taken care of at the hospital.

573
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,370
 Thankfully, her allergy symptoms are nearly gone.

574
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:59,250
 Thank you for all your concerns.

575
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:24,650
 Assistant Manager Jang, Oh Yu Jin lives in Bannae-dong.

576
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:26,520

Wow, she lives in an expensive neighborhood.

577
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,460
 Her husband's a doctor. A dentist.

578
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:32,790
 I guess you have to be that rich to live in Bannae-dong.

579
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:47,660
Close the curtains.

580
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,250
Gosh, that woman.

581
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:57,590
She was just throwing a fit wondering why you weren't coming.

582
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:59,460
It's okay.

583
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:18,780
 Oh Yu Jin

584
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:34,830

Ji Yool's back from the hospital. The allergic reaction is gone. Sorry for worrying you guys.

585
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:37,870
Gosh, why aren't they responding?

586
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:46,320
 Kim Na Yeong

587
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:57,520
Why are they so quiet?

588
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:02,430
 3 people have not read the text

589
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:16,480
 Ladies, did you have fun?

590
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,350
 I should join next time.

591
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:21,050
 Looks like the kids are loving the food.

592
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:23,320
 Is the sweet, crispy fried chicken that good?

593
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:27,470
 The peanuts on top look so good.

594
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:32,590
Right here. The truth behind the incident from two years ago.

595
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:37,070
How could she tell such lies to have her daughter audition again?

596
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:39,090
But...

597
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:41,790
No way. How could she lie like that?

598
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:46,270
She's lied about her daughter not taking lessons. She's lied numerous times.

599
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:50,470
Who knows what else she's lied about besides the peanut allergy?

600
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:55,830
True. On Yu Jin's SNS, you only see posts about her in-laws in the States

601
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:57,900
but nothing about her side of the family.

602
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,150
Exactly.

603
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:04,220
And I think there's something fishy about Ji Yool getting the Snow Princess role.

604
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:09,840
If she's done it once, she can do it again.

605
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,710
 Gold Mom 2

606
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:17,460
Jeong Ah made another group chat.

607
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:23,900
Hello?

608
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,610
Hello? Hello?

609
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:30,790
 Is this Yu Jin?

610
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:33,690
 010-912-9339

611
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:37,930

This is Assistant Manager Jang Mi Ho.

612
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:45,130
 Is this Yu Jin?

613
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:03,210
How can you live so carefree?

614
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,830
 Calls  
Gosh, why?

615
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:11,660
Why is she calling me now?

616
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:16,350
 Who knows what else she's lied about besides the peanut allergy?

617
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:38,450
 Oh Yu Jin

618
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,210
Mi Ho, where are you going?

619
00:46:57,210 --> 00:46:59,490
Give me a minute. Sorry.

620
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:00,520
 Oh Yu Jin

621
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:09,370
 Oh Yu Jin

622
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:12,570
 Hello?

623
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:14,440
Is this Mi Ho?

624
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:19,540
Yeah.

625
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:25,250
I wondered if it was really you.

626
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:28,530
I couldn't believe it was you.

627
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:30,570
Good to hear from you.

628
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:34,930
Yeah.

629
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:39,480
 How are you?

630
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:43,500
 Are you doing well?

631
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:46,210
Yeah, we are all doing well.

632
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:49,650
Yu Jin, I'm home!

633
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:53,960
I can't talk long.

634
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,510
How about we meet?

635
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:59,030
Meet?

636
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:02,160
Yeah, I'll call you back.

637
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:08,800
Welcome home.

638
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,030
Were you in the utility room?

639
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:12,030
Yeah, I was cleaning it out.

640
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:14,250
We should throw away stuff we don't need.

641
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:49,650
Hey, I'm Jang Mi Ho from fourth grade, class 7.

642
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:01,770
 ooo_yoojin

643
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:33,600
Welcome.

644
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:05,380
It's been so long since I've seen you.

645
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:06,900
Is your mom well?

646
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:08,820
Yeah.

647
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:12,840
She's in the care home for knee joint surgery.

648
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:15,630
It's been some time since my dad passed away.

649
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:18,130
I see.

650
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:21,660
- Sorry.
 - No need.

651
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:24,020
Although we lived like a family,

652
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:26,650
we were never a real family.

653
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:45,030
Why... did you contact me?

654
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:46,750
Just because.

655
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:48,590
I was curious how you were doing.

656
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:52,290
Is that really it? You must have a reason.

657
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,610
Do I need a reason?

658
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:12,080
What happened back then—

659
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:17,260
Take your time and open it later.

660
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,030
What's this?

661
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:21,780
My feelings.

662
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:27,880
Sorry, I left the kids with my husband, so I need to go.

663
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,790
I'll get going.

664
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:04,760
Yu Jin! Oh Yu Jin!

665
00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:30,540
 The customer is not answering the phone.

666
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:26,140

I'm in front of your house. Come down now.

667
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:29,410
She's crazy! Where does she think she is?

668
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:31,260
Honey, are you home?

669
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:35,780
Yeah, but I'm going to take out the trash.

670
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:37,270
Okay.

671
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,410
Aigoo!

672
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:05,480
No! I said I'm washing first!

673
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,040
I'm older.

674
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,280
Ha Yool, let's wash your feet first.

675
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,470
No! No!

676
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:14,590

If you've got something to say, you come up. Tenth floor.

677
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:31,210
What should we say at first?

678
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:33,540
We should ask right away before she finds a way to wriggle out of it.

679
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:36,580
Don't you think it's a bit much to corner her like this?

680
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:38,570
Who are you defending right now?

681
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:40,880
It's not like we'll have a go at Yu Jin.

682
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,680
Let's take it easy.

683
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,440
Shouldn't we at least hear her out?

684
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:52,540
Should we go get coffee?

685
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:54,640
Let's get coffee. Okay?

686
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:06,910
Never mind. Why go outside?

687
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:08,090
Do you want to come inside?

688
00:56:08,090 --> 00:56:10,430
No, I came to give this back.

689
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:12,760
Why did you give me this?

690
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:16,200
Hey, are you listening?

691
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,200
Why? Was it not enough?

692
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,760
What?

693
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,640
Hey! How could you say that?

694
00:56:29,870 --> 00:56:31,390
Hey!

695
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:39,190
What are you doing right now?

696
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:40,460
Honey, you home?

697
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:44,300
Can you get me body wash for the kids? We're all out.

698
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,800
W-Wait! Wait!

699
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:55,500
Yu Jin.

700
00:56:59,930 --> 00:57:02,430
Are you home, Yu Jin?

701
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:04,040
Yu Jin!

702
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:17,440
♫  Something's wrong, uncover my blindfolded eyes  ♫

703
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:24,340
♫  It's over, I can't hide anymore  ♫

704
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:30,120
♫  The crooked trust, the hidden anxiety  ♫

705
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:32,810
♫  I grow by eating them  ♫

706
00:57:32,810 --> 00:57:36,020
♫  My twisted memory  ♫

707
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:42,030
♫  Buried scars eventually choke us  ♫

708
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:47,820
♫  Never leave behind again  ♫

709
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:50,270
♫  Wake up, break your desire  ♫

710
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:53,520
 Battle For Happiness

711
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,770
 I'd love to shoot an advertisement.

712
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:56,660
 Mi Ho!

713
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:58,840
 This time, she's a real auntie.

714
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:00,190
 Give it!

715
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:01,780
 I won't let this go!

716
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:05,870
 Everything you did! I'm telling the bank!

717
00:58:05,870 --> 00:58:07,760
 She's told so many lies.

718
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,430
 I'll be looking forward to an appropriate solution.

719
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:11,320
 If not me, who else would resolve this?

720
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:14,940
 How could you do this to me, Eonni! You started it!

721
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:17,100
 I'll help you.

722
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:20,710
 I guess you can tell the truth right here.  Tell the truth!

723
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:23,890
 Do you still resent me?

724
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:27,450
 Wasn't Ji Yool a bit strange that day?  
 -  I think it's abuse.

725
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:29,000
 Just in case someone gets jealous.

726
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,340
 Don't worry, it won't happen.

727
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:35,170
 Because I'll do anything.

728
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:41,180
 Oh, yeah, aren't you due for a promotion soon?

729
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:44,670
 Ah Rin's mom!

730
00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:46,830
 I have a strange feeling.

731
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:48,550
 Have a look at this.

732
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:50,110
 I wonder why Ji Yool did that.

733
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:51,470
 I'll take care of it.

734
00:58:51,470 --> 00:58:54,710
 I think you have more to lose than me.
