 Battle For Happiness

10
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,860
 This is a work of fiction. Characters, locations, agencies, incidents, organizations, and jobs have no relation to real life.

11
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,200

Do you know something?

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,100
 I know enough.

13
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,930
 Did you think I didn't know you worked at a host bar?

14
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:58,720
 Jeong Su Bin, that bastard, he fell for Oh Yu Jin and followed her everywhere.

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,360
 His love letters were so sincere as well.

16
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,670
 The day Oh Yu Jin died, he was waiting for her by himself in the underground parking.

17
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:05,630
 My husband didn't do it.

18
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,360
 She went out of her way to purchase the apartment that was way too much for her.

19
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,680
 You know that most motives for murder are usually infatuation, resentment, or money.

20
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,720
 Still, I must check with my own eyes

21
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,050
 her meeting Kang Do Joon.

22
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:22,340
 On the day Yu Jin died, I think someone was there.

23
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,920
 It could be an eyewitness or an accomplice.

24
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,210
 It's really not me!

25
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,330
 You opened the locker, right? B-19?

26
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,870
 Actually, Ji Yool's drawing was there originally.

27
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,440
 That. Find out about that. That's the evidence.

28
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,610
 Did you draw this, Ji Yool?

29
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,800
 - Yeah.
 - Ji Yool...

30
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,850
 you have four people in your family,

31
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,930
 but why did you draw five people?

32
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:47,380
 Mommy told us we have an eonni, too.

33
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:59,560

34
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,880
Ji Yool, you have four people in your family,

35
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,020
so why did you draw five people?

36
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,400
I can't tell you.

37
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,620
She said it was a secret.

38
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,130
Who said that?

39
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,670
Mommy.

40
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,500
I'll keep your secret.

41
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,820
Just tell it only to me.

42
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,460
She said we have an older sister, too.

43
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:47,900
Mommy said so—that we have an older sister in our family.

44
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,700
An Eonni?

45
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,790
What older sister?

46
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,670
An angel.

47
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,750
She was like an angel.

48
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,530
Mommy said she was an angel.

49
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,870
I guess she went to heaven.

50
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,890
You will make sure to keep it a secret, right?

51
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,660
Ji Yool, did Mommy really say that?

52
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,000
That you guys have an older sister?

53
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,390
Ji Yool!

54
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,760
Ji Yool, please open the door.

55
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,570
Ji Yool!

56
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,630
What brings you here?

57
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:49,060
 Oh Yu Jin

58
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,580
- What is this?
 - I'm giving it to you because I think you'll need it.

59
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,440
 I can't be sure of it, either.

60
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,410
 But based on the timing and circumstance,

61
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:04,790
 if she's not Yu Jin's child, who could it be?

62

 Episode 14

63
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,240
What is going on between you two?

64
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,010
What have you two plotted together?

65
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:53,290
All that's left is to ditch this place.

66
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,420
Do you want everything to be exposed?

67
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,030
 Private Detective Agency

68
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,020
Did you install the secret recording app on Hwang Ji Hye's phone?

69
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,030
 No, I'm planning to go to the branch tomorrow morning.

70
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,530
Can't you hurry it up?

71
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,190
Also...

72
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,300
do you have anyone who could get physical?

73
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,460
 Well, that's handled by a separate group.

74
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,780
Introduce me to them.

75
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,280
What is the severity you're looking for?

76
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,860
I don't know.

77
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,960
How about...

78
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,450
just enough to step on her a bit?

79
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,840
 I'll call you back after I look into it.

80
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,560
Who is it?

81
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,140
Can I come in for a moment?

82
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,010
You should talk to me here.

83
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,920
What is your relationship with Hwang Ji Hye?

84
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,950
I think she's told you guys.

85
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,350
We've met a couple of times with interest in each other.

86
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:21,130
Do you know where Hwang Ji Hye was on the day Oh Yu Jin died?

87
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,330
I wouldn't know that, either.

88
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:24,510
We weren't that close.

89
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:29,640
Kang Do Joon, how much do you trust Hwang Ji Hye?

90
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:35,930
How much longer do you think Hwang Ji Hye will keep her mouth shut in your relationship?

91
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,170
What are you talking about?

92
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:44,680
You don't know how weak the relationship between accomplices is, do you?

93
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:50,610
That sort of relationship crumbles with the slightest crack.

94
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,030
Hey, Detective Bae.

95
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:58,340
This case is already closed, so what are you doing?

96
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,890
Do your superiors know you're doing this, Detective?

97
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,510
If you have time to waste,

98
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:08,690
why don't you just go to a mental hospital with Jang Mi Ho?

99
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,060
 If you dare to open your mouth,

100
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,580
 I'll kill both you and your child.

101
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,690
 If you don't want me to expose what you're doing with that apartment,

102
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:25,270
 continue to keep your mouth shut.

103
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,950
 Baek Seong Hui

104
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,660
Yes, Ji Hye.

105
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,990
Hey, Seong Hui.

106
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:56,210
I-I think i-it would be good... for us to stamp our seal on the contract quickly.

107
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,210
 Oh, is that so?

108
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,960
You have time the day after tomorrow, right?

109
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,640
How about we meet up right away and get it done?

110
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,580
Oh, okay.

111
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,570
Since we decided to do it anyway, it would be good for us to get it over with quickly.

112
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,350
Okay, I'll see you then.

113
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:14,360
Oh, by the way, does So Won like macarons?

114
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,000
I was thinking of bringing some for So Won.

115
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,800
 Thinking about it now, Eun Han and So Won are close, but they never went to a kids' cafe together.

116
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,410
We should all go together later.

117
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,780
It's okay. We don't need to.

118
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,820
I'll see you then.

119
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,870
Wake up.

120
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,850
Come to your senses!

121
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:43,080
Who is pitying who?

122
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,080
I'm the most pitiful.

123
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,610
Is it this?

124
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,820
No.

125
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,970
Oh, it's this one.

126
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,470
Let's take a look.

127
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,720
Where would be the prettiest spot?

128
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,350
So pretty! Let's go.

129
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:14,420
Give me her backpack. I'll take her today.

130
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,850
What's the occasion? How about work?

131
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,250
Who cares if I'm a little late?

132
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,050
Family is most important.

133
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,410
I told you I'll be good to you.

134
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,700
Go ahead and take her.

135
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,150
You should say goodbye to Mommy.

136
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,410
I'll be back.

137
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,330
All right, have a good day at kindergarten.

138
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,020
Let's go.

139
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,480
Where are you?

140
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,660
Oh, you can come right now.

141
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,650
- Yes. 
- Good morning!

142
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:51,900
Hello.

143
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,440
Good morning!

144
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,070
Hello.

145
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,810
- Good morning, Chloe. 
- Good morning.

146
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:58,360
Bye!

147
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,100
- Please take good care of her. 
- Of course.

148
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,440
Hello!

149
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,110
Good morning!

150
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,530
Wait for me.

151
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,860
Hello.

152
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,460
Are you Lee Tae Ho of Unit 1803?

153
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,850
- Yes. Why?
 - Your registered mail is here.

158

- What is this?
 - Can't you tell from looking at it?

159
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,810
It's a letter of divorce.

160
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,410
So I'm asking what is this!

 Recorded audio transcript

162
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,120
Na Yeong, why are you being like this?

163
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,040
You know it wasn't a serious relationship!

164
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,550
What is the reason you're going to this extent?

165
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,960
Please come in.

166
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,900
Please come this way.

167
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:18,690
Please pack everything from here to here.

168
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:19,910
Why would you pack those things?

169
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,250
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

170
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,260
You cheated on me

171
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,060
without stopping once since Ah Rin turned 100 days old.

172
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:32,550
Oh, right. I heard Ms. Jo Ah Ra is pregnant.

173
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:36,800
You were planning on starting a new family of four with her and Ah Rin after you divorced me.

174
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,090
That was because I lost my mind temporarily-

175
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,930
It's true I did wrong, but why are you suddenly doing this?

176
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,210
It's not like this was the first time I was like this—

177
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,130
I'll take those words as your admission

178
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,770
of habitual cheating.

179
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,540
Are you being serious?

180
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,530
If you're just trying to scare me, stop it.

181
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,680
I get it.

182
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,120
I finally understand how much of an idiot I've been.

183
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,630
I was stupid for trying to depend on someone else.

184
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,500
I thought I couldn't live with my dad or you!

185
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,040
But it's not like that anymore.

186
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,340
I will live properly.

187
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:13,080
So, leave.

188
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,070
Na Yeong, it seems like you are really worked up right now.

189
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,710
No, I am not.

190
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:19,680
I'm telling you to leave my house.

191
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,150
Get out of my face.

192
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,840
Where are you going with these?

193
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,790
A studio in Yimyeong-dong.

194
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,770
Where is that?

195
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,210
Geez.

196
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,750
 Director Kang Do Joon

197
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,100
Yes?

198
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,990
It's quite hectic for me right now, so—

199
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,440
The missus said you should take these, too.

200
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,690
Oh, I see.

201
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,360
Let's meet today.

202
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,400
Please come to the hotel.

203
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,940
I can't go right now. I'll call you later.

204
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,140
You're my attorney!

205
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,970
So you should come when I tell you to!

206
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,720
If anyone hears you, they'll think I took on your case officially!

207
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,250
I was just temporarily helping you out, don't forget that!

208
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,080
Who do you think you are to treat me like your servant!

209
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,340
Hey— Hello?

210
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,660
This bastard.

211
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,950
Damn it.

212
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,570
Damn that bastard. Damn it!

213
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:27,520
I never said anything like that.

214
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:34,970
I wonder why Ms. Jang made something like that up.

215
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,560
I think I need to go now—

216
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,060
Ms. Hwang Ji Hye.

217
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:43,620
There are many times that an eyewitness

218
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,130
becomes an accomplice by not saying what they should say.

219
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,530
You just have to get Mr. Go's weekly work files and hand them to the Team Leader.

220
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:06,360
And I will personally give the activity report on the third-generation bank creators.

221
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,820
 You don't have anything else that is urgent?

222
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,250
Yeah.

223
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,420
Sorry for suddenly taking my vacation.

224
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,330
Don't worry and have a good trip.

225
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,850
And please be careful.

226
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,530
Okay.

227
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:26,850
 Mommy told us we have an older sister too.

228
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,770
 I guess she went to heaven.

229
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,660
 Mommy said she was an angel.

230
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,140
 Do you even know why Yu Jin died?

231
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:41,620
 You can't find out anything without me.

232
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,170
What about the money?

233
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:03,280
- Who's this?
 - That's for you to tell me, Sim Hye Jeong.

234
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:08,070
- I don't know this girl.
 - She's the daughter Yu Jin bore while she was here.

235
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,460
And right now, you're raising her.

236
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,240
What kind of nonsense are you saying now?

237
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,610
Was this what Kang Do Joon paid you to keep secret?

238
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:39,450
She came knowing everything.

239
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:44,560
A woman named Jang Mi Ho might come here.

240
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,580
Don't tell her anything.

241
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,610
If she is Yu Jin's daughter,

242
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:52,410
do you think Kang Do Joon, with his pride, would have done nothing?

243
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:54,400
Stop talking nonsense,

244
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,580
and if you're not going to give me money, leave.

245
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,860
Please go to the police and tell them the truth.

246
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,690
Are you crazy?

247
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,850
It's only a matter of time before the police find out.

248
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,210
That's right.

249
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:08,080
If Ju Ah was Yu Jin's daughter, the police would have found out long ago.

250
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,470
Tell them to open all the files,

251
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:12,030
such as the birth certificate and the adoption papers from the orphanage!

252
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:15,110
What a shitty imagination you've got.

253
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:19,450
Then why would Yu Jin tell her child that she has an older sister?

254
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,540
Why are you asking me that?

255
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:27,740
Maybe, like someone said, she went a bit crazy before she died.

256
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,370
Then I guess it's okay if I meet with that child.

257
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,390
The girl named Sim Ju Ah.

258
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,630
 I had a smoke because I got pissed off.

259
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,020
 She's being so pretentious. It's just a lollipop.

260
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:50,600
 Don't give the attention whore attention and just report her.

261
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,090
 I'm supposed to go buy a wallet with him tomorrow after eating pasta.

262
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,540
 Give me some recommendations.

263
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,980
 Is Sim Ju Ah really selling her body for benefits?

264
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,720
 Stop replying to her as if it's real.

265
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,330
 If you do, she'll get excited and act like an attention whore.

266
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:06,400
You just wait and see if I really do it or not.

267
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,340
Welcome!

268
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,940
- Why were you away for so long?
 - How are you?

269
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,140
Oh, of course.

270
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,650
Please sit over there.

271
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,190
Oh, my, sorry.

272
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,510
Gosh, it's been so long.

273
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:25,720
 Associate Manager Lee Jin Seop (Digital Division)

274
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,130
- Hey.
  - Auntie!

275
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,440
 Auntie!

276
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,230
Are you playing well with Uncle?

277
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:33,520
 Auntie, Uncle isn't letting us eat chocolate syrup.

278
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,550
- Where is Uncle?
  - Surprise!

279
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,780
 Uncle is here.

280
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,330
 Hope everything goes well.

281
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:39,400
Thanks.

282
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,900
 Bye!

283
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,830
Ji Yool and Ha Yool, make sure you listen to Uncle, okay?

284
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:45,820
 Okay!

285
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,020
What the...

286
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,530
 Associate Manager Lee Jin Seop (Digital Division)

287
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,250
Yeah, I'm here.

288
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,810
Are you all right?

289
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:52,120
We've only got this angle.

290
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,890
But they're wearing a hood, so...

291
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:57,540
Can you tell who it is?

292
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,890
- You didn't get hit? Are you okay?
 - I'm okay.

293
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:18,320
Let's go back inside together.

294
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,190
- Let me take a look.
 - It's dangerous, so we should go inside.

295
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,120
 If you dare to open your mouth,

296
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,750
 I'll kill both you and your child.

297
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,870
  So if you don't want me to expose what you're doing with that apartment,

298
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:42,510
 continue to keep your mouth shut.

299
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:56,470
Oh, you're here?

300
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:00,180
You should have just said to meet up at your or my house.

301
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:03,200
What good will come of others finding out about this?

302
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,270
You brought your husband's seal as well, right?

303
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,720
Yes.

304
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,100
All right.

305
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,150
 Real Estate Sales Contract 
Take a look.

306
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:17,080
You just have to stamp here and here.

307
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,120
But...

308
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:25,120
I wonder if it's okay to do a deal like this without getting a realtor involved.

309
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,300
Then...

310
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,770
you can look elsewhere.

311
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,630
I'm selling this a 100 million won cheaper.

312
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:36,630
I don't want to pay an additional broker fee.

313
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,330
There are many people who would buy this besides you, Seong Hui.

314
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,940
Gosh, what are you doing?

315
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,990
I'll just do it.

316
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,340
- Here?
 - Yes.

317
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:57,740
You know you need to send the downpayment by this week, right?

318
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,800
Of course.

319
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:10,180
You have to keep this a secret until the full balance is paid, okay?

320
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,590
Okay.

321
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:17,280
- Thank you.
 - No problem!

322
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,110
You're getting a good deal.

323
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,800
Thanks to you.

324
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,280
 Even we can't figure out the secret of her birth from just her name, age, and address.

325
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,430
Then, can't you at least find out which hospital she was born in?

326
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:32,390
 Gosh, medical records are even more difficult.

327
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:35,040
Okay, I got it.

328
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,080
 Princess Jjua

329
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,470
 I had a smoke because I got pissed off.

330
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:45,020
 I'm supposed to go buy a wallet with him tomorrow after eating pasta.

331
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,120
 Give me some recommendations.

332
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,870
 Man, I don't want to go to school.

333
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:50,070
 I'll tell you about how I got a bag after just having one meal with them.

334
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:52,270
 Princess is bored. DM me.

335
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,880
 He says he'll take me to an omakase restaurant.

336
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,070
 I like that he's handsome.

337
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:57,230
 And I like it even more that he isn't stingy with his money.

338
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:08,020
Hey, what are you doing right now!

339
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,790
Let go of me!

340
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,390
You were the one who threw the pot last time, too, right?

341
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:16,680
I told you to let go!

342
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:22,430
Who are you? Who are you that you're so reckless and rude?

343
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:25,250
I'm like this because I'm a motherless orphan! What of it?

344
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:36,210
- You...
 - Are they only...

345
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:38,450
Are they the only ones who are your kids?

346
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:40,260
What about me?

347
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,400
What about me!

348
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:04,740
My ball...

349
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,340
You're my mom, too.

350
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:21,000
So why are you only living with them? What about me?

351
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,870
I'll kill you all.

352
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,290
I'll kill off your family.

353
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:07,860
I...

354
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:13,130
am actually not their mom either.

355
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,640
I'm their aunt.

356
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,860
I'm only taking care of them because of an unfortunate situation.

357
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,560
Don't lie to me.

358
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,570
If you're going to ignore me, you shouldn't have given birth to me.

359
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,910
I don't know what made you misunderstand, but—

360
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,850
Then what was that I heard?

361
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,730
Grandma said to someone on the phone

362
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,440
that my birth mom lives here.

363
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,180
I'll pay you back the 20 million won really quickly.

364
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:35,330
I was the one who raised and fed her daughter all this time.

365
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:37,360
You think she won't give me 20 million won?

366
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,910
Yeah. Yeah. I'm supposed to meet with her tomorrow.

367
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:45,250
One of those apartments was worth hundreds of millions of won.

368
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,140
Yeah, yeah.

369
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:53,410
Sorry. I'm sorry.

370
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,740
It's true your birth mom did live here,

371
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,750
but I'm not her.

372
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,260
Then, where is that woman right now?

373
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:14,720
- I'm sorry. 
- What are you sorry about?

374
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:20,000
I'm asking you right now. Where is that woman?

375
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,330
What is this... Did she like die or something?

376
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,190
Great.

377
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:48,670
She abandoned her child and ran away.

378
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:52,100
Oh, what a shame.

379
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,610
I should have been the one to kill her.

380
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,120
Get in, it's late.

381
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,080
Tell me...

382
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,020
why she died,

383
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,410
how she lived, and how she died.

384
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:47,910
I must hear it.

385
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,940
It's already late at night, so—

386
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,550
I'm not going anywhere until you tell me.

387
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,150
Take a seat.

388
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:31,800
 Marilyn

389
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,450
- The last time— Oh, there's no more. 
 - Bring some more.

390
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,570
- Hey.
 - Yes?

391
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:48,930
- Bring me three more beers.
 - Okay.

392
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,760
 Ju Ah is with me.

393
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,510
 I'll have her sleepover for the night at Yu Jin's place.

394
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:59,000
Where is Ju Ah? Did she come?

395
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,890
I wouldn't know that.

396
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:09,700
Give me your hand.

397
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:18,300
Why don't you just hurry up and tell me?

398
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,320

399
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:30,280
What? Is there anything else that's distracting you?

400
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,480
Damn it.

401
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:37,260
Do you want to eat first?

402
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,830
Gosh, it's so bad.

403
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,770
 Marilyn

404
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,840
- Yes?
 -  What are you doing!

405
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,380
- Didn't you see my message? 
-  Forget it.

406
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:28,110
 Tell Ju Ah to leave the house right now.

407
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:31,090
 Why would you take a child as you please?

408
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,910
 You said Ju Ah has nothing to do with Yu Jin.

409
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,780
So why are you acting like this?

410
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:48,460
Okay.

411
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,160
 Ju Ah is at Yu Jin's place.

412
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,920
 Jang Mi Ho says she'll have her sleepover for the night there.

413
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,700
 I'm here, so bring her down.

414
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:39,660
Ju Ah, I got a call from your grandmother, and I think you need to go now.

415
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,010
That ahjussi...

416
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:47,480
Is that ahjussi...

417
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:51,050
my mom's husband?

418
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,690
Yes.

419
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,320
Why?

420
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,670
Do you him by chance?

421
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:39,420
 I'll tell you about how I got a bag after just having one meal with them.

422
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,000
 Do not give her attention or feed her.

423
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,210
 It's a waste to even call her an attention whore. I think she's just crazy.

424
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:45,710
Damn it, I'll really do it.

425
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,800
Gosh, who is it?

426
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,060
- Hey.
 - Let go!

427
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,000
Ju Ah.

428
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,940
Let go! Let go!

429
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,680
- Ju Ah.
 - I told you to let go of me!

430
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,200
You know that man, right?

431
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,670
I don't know. I don't know him.

432
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,190
I've never even met him.

433
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,780
I didn't do anything with him!

434
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:41,390
 I'll tell you about how I got a bag after just having one meal with them.

435
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:42,780
 He says he'll take me to an omakase restaurant.

436
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,800
 I like that he's handsome.

437
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,950
 And I like it even more that he isn't stingy with his money.

438
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:34,190
Start it. As soon as possible.

439
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,620
Why are you being like this?

440
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,890
Are you crazy?

441
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:10,770
Where do you think this is?

442
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:12,790
You're supposed to be her grandmother. What have you done all this time?

443
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,690
Who are you to talk to me like that?

444
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:17,150
Who do you think you are?

445
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:19,220

 Detective Bae Chang Hoon – Bannae Police Station

454
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:22,970
 The child that Sim Hye Jeong from Marilyn is raising is Yu Jin's daughter.

455
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:27,280
 I don't know what it says in documents, but I'm sure that's right.

456
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,660
 That child acted like she harmed herself to get attention,

457
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:34,200
 and posted on her social media that she sold her body for favors.

 I think Kang Do Joon used that to approach Ju Ah.

461
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,490
 Kang Do Joon

462
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,540
 And I think Yu Jin found out about it.

463
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,430
 If Yu Jin had done some digging around Kang Do Joon,

464
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:02,550
 there's no way she wouldn't have learned that.

 I believe that is the reason the two fought on the day Yu Jin died,

468
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:19,350
 and the motive for Kang Do Joon killing Yu Jin.

 So? You haven't gotten a reply from the Detective?

475
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,530
I haven't.

476
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:53,550
I'm thinking of going to meet Deputy Manager Hwang.

477
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:55,400
I'm sure she knows something

478
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,060
about what took place between Yu Jin and Kang Do Joon over Ju Ah.

479
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:02,500
The only way right now is for Ms. Hwang to open her mouth.

480
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,960
What are your thoughts?

481
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:13,890
After receiving your texts yesterday, I've had many thoughts.

482
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:17,470
However, as you know, there's nothing to prove it.

483
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:21,510
I know. That's why I'm going to meet with Deputy Manager Hwang— I mean  Hwang Ji Hye.

484
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,910
I'm sure she knows something.

485
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:31,320
You said this was a picture that Oh Yu Jin had put in the locker, right?

486
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,860
- Yes.
 - This picture...

487
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:37,560
I'm wondering if this was the picture Oh Yu Jin ripped up.

488
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,400
What?

489
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,550
You know that before Oh Yu Jin died, she moved around the house, right?

490
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,570
 She found a picture in the children's room,

491
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:47,130
 and she ripped it up and threw it away into the toilet.

492
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,720
Detective.

493
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,950
You said Yu Jin's cause of death was from excessive bleeding.

494
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:01,010
If 911 was called right away, could she have survived?

495
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:04,020
Probably.

496
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,950
 Help me...

497
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,070
 Yu Jin, Oh Yu Jin.

498
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,240
 Is something the matter?

499
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,140
 Help...

500
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,210
 Deputy Manager Hwang Ji Hye – Shindang Station Branch

501
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,780
 The call is not going through...

502
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,910
You don't know when she'll come home. You're still here?

503
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:04,850
I need to meet with her somehow.

504
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:07,590
But that doesn't have to be today, though.

505
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:10,220
You didn't eat anything yet, right?

506
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,670
Let's go.

507
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:19,300
Come on, let's go.

508
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:26,350
I'll check and see if the restaurant has seats.

509
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,950
Hey, Jin Seop! Oh, no!

510
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:48,500
Gosh, what do I do?

511
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:52,480
Just hold on!

512
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:58,200
 Emergency Center

513
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:04,770
I came after receiving a report.

514
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,790
Hey!

515
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:11,140
 Marilyn

516
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:18,690
You know where Kang Do Joon is right now, right?

517
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,500
 Wait a sec.

518
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:39,490
What are you trying to do?

519
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:43,250
Where is he? You hired him, right?

520
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:46,730
Damn it.

521
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:50,110
Hey! Jang Mi Ho!

522
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:54,450
 Real Estate Sales Contrac/tv

523
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,850
You're doing this because you killed her.

524
00:43:57,850 --> 00:44:01,090
Why are you harming people who have nothing to do with this?

525
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:08,990
You look like the one who killed someone.

526
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:10,130
Do you have evidence?

527
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:12,810
Do you have evidence that I was the one who did it?

528
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:18,680
I'm getting a restraining order against you soon.

529
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:22,150
If you ever do something like this again, I'll put you in jail.

530
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:24,250
I won't stand for this.

531
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:28,290
I will pay you back for everything for Yu Jin and her kids. So brace yourself.

532
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:38,010
 M/38 Kim * Joon / M/31 Lee * Seop /  M/41 Joo * Min

533
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,620
Oh, Assistant Manager!

534
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:12,930
Gosh, why are you being like that?

535
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:14,320
Can't you see I'm perfectly fine?

536
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,900
I just got a neat fracture where I got hit.

537
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:25,850
- Sorry.
 - Gosh, seriously.

538
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:27,550
Why would you be sorry, Assistant Manager?

539
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:29,500
Were you the one who hit me?

540
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:33,710
I shouldn't have asked you to help me.

541
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:35,910
Why are you being like this?

542
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:38,750
I was the one who volunteered to do it first.

543
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:48,060
Please look at me.

544
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:54,910
Make sure you catch the bastard that did this to me.

545
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,540
I feel like I know who it is.

546
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:01,890
So please catch him and pay him back for me.

547
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:08,520
Gosh, but it's dangerous by yourself.

548
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,110
Well, then...

549
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:13,200
I guess I'll just have to recover quickly.

550
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:23,870
 Did you hear?

551
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:25,500
 There was an assault at the apartments.

552
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,330
 Really? An assault?

553
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:28,550
 In the apartment complex?

554
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:31,040
 The victim was supposedly Jang Mi Ho's junior at her workplace.

555
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,600
 Oh my, oh my, goodness.

556
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,170
 He didn't get too hurt, right?

557
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:35,920
 He didn't get too hurt,

558
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,620
 but supposedly, it's hard to find the culprit.

559
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,330
 Seeing how he covered up his motorcycle license plate,

560
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:41,470
 and did this where there were no CCTVs,

561
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:44,430
 so people were saying someone probably plotted this.

562
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:45,530
 Real Estate Sales Contract

563
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:53,140
We stamped everything with our seal.

564
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:54,500
Yes.

565
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:57,090
You just bought a good house for a cheap price.

566
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:58,630
Please send the downpayment right away.

567
00:46:58,630 --> 00:46:59,910
Okay.

568
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:03,570
Have a good day.

569
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:05,680
Yes, have a good day.

570
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:16,470
 Ji Hye, I just sent the downpayment. Please check to make sure that you received it.

571
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:19,750
 Thanks to you, Ji Hye, I think I bought a good house for a cheap price.

572
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:21,950
 Finally, I don't have to long-term lease a house.

573
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:24,270
 Thank you.

574
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:26,520
 Ms. Hwang, I just sent the downpayment.

575
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,320
 Please check it.

576
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:34,190
 Baek Seong Hui, Kang Wu Hyeok - Sent 1 billion won
 Byeon Seong Han, Kang Seong Dae, Seong Ha Neul - Sent 1 billion won

577
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:35,390
 Account balance - 4 billion won

578
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:47,720
 The Deputy Department Head's weakness that Kang Do Joon knows.

579
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,600
 Jang Mi Ho!

580
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:53,130
 Real Estate Sales Contract

581
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:55,780
 I'm sure it was a real estate sales contract.

582
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:58,320
- I saw it all!
 - Seriously, you—

583
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:03,450
So? Shall I expose everything here?

584
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:05,260
Shall I expose everything?

585
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,520
Why did you come in to work already?

586
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:18,110
What good will come of staying at home? I'll just be bored.

587
00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:19,320
So what shall I do now?

588
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:22,380
Don't get involved. I'll take care of everything by myself from now.

589
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:24,620
Pardon?

590
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,370
Are you seriously going to be like this?

591
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:31,060
You're going to leave me out of it now after all that?

592
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:33,600
Seriously, why did I get hurt then?

593
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,250
I got hurt for nothing.

594
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,170
I'm so upset.

595
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:47,370
Why? Does it hurt?

596
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:50,340
I feel like it won't hurt if you tell me.

597
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,720
I saw pictures of Deputy Manager Hwang Ji Hye in Kang Do Joon's hotel room.

598
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:01,990
It appeared she was meeting with several people.

599
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:04,170
I felt like that was a bit strange.

600
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:07,560
Okay. I'll look into it.

601
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:13,380
 Yeong Su, I haven't been able to reach Deputy Manager Hwang Ji Hye.

602
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:14,660
 Did something happen to her?

603
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:15,860
 Deputy Manager Hwang Ji Hye?

604
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:17,650
 I don't know. Even though I'm part of HR,

605
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:20,450
 I don't know everything about the employees' personal matters.

606
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:22,450
 Don't you have Associate Manager Lee Jin Seop in your division?

607
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:23,550
 You should ask him.

608
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:26,910
 He is a colleague of Mr. Park Jin Ju, who works at the Shindang Station location.

609
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:30,550
Apparently, Deputy Manager Hwang is selling her house.

610
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,490
- What?
 -  But did everyone hear the news?

611
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:36,180
 Ms. Byeon Seong Han made a purchase agreement for Ms. Hwang Ji Hye's house.

612
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:38,910
 He was bragging so much about how he bought it for a cheap price.

613
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:44,190
 She went out of her way to purchase the apartment that was way too much for her.

614
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:46,190
 Even paying interest on top of repaying principal in installments.

615
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:50,050
 She must have had to fork over tens of millions of won each month to the bank.

616
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:54,220
 I heard she asked Seong Hui to buy her place not too long ago.

617
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:58,030
Well, I mean that much is okay.

618
00:49:58,030 --> 00:49:59,780
Just a moment.

619
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:03,920
Yes, Mi Ho.

620
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,660
Hey, Seong Hui, please understand even if I am being a little abrupt in how I ask this.

621
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:09,640
By chance, did you agree to a house purchase with Hwang Ji Hye?

622
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:13,140
Where did you hear that from?

623
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:17,390
Ask your colleague at the Shindang Station branch where Deputy Manager Hwang Ji Hye is.

624
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:20,100
Yes, well, things turned out like that.

625
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:24,320
To be honest, I've been taking out long-term leases on houses—

626
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:28,030
Seong Hui, quickly call your bank and request a suspension of payment to Deputy Manager Hwang Ji Hye.

627
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:29,700
Please do it as soon as you can.

628
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:35,350
She suddenly took a day off.

629
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:53,700
 Overseas remittance - Recipient: Yang Hee Tae

630
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:56,680
 Transfer amount

631
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:09,560
 5 billion won

632
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:12,130
 Send

633
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,380
 Thank you.

634
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:18,650
 Thanks to you, Ji Hye, I think I bought a good house for a cheap price.

635
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:20,860
 Finally, I don't have to long-term lease a house.

636
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,850
 Thank you.

637
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,340
 Baek Seong Hui

638
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:37,650
 Deputy Head Byeon Seong Han of DGB Individual Customers Department

639
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:43,640
 Send

640
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:46,370
 A request for remittance has been made

641
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:53,810
So Won, let's go.

642
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,140
 Mi Ho, Ji Hye isn't picking up her phone.

643
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:05,450
 What is going on?

644
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,230
I'm sorry, sir, but could you go a bit faster?

645
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:25,950
Mom, when are we coming back?

646
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:37,840
Let's go.

647
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:52,270
Why are you doing this?

648
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:53,910
- Move! Let go of me!
 - I can't!

649
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:55,360
What about So Won?

650
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,210
At this rate, you'll really become a felon!

651
00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:00,110
I told you to let go of me. Let go, let go!

652
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:01,420
Let go!

653
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:04,470
I can't let go. You really shouldn't be doing that to me, of all people.

654
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:05,700
You should at least say what you need to!

655
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:08,100
Who are you to do this to me?

656
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,530
Did you have to go this far?

657
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:14,650
You, of all people, know how hard it is to save money.

658
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:17,550
You know how hard people worked to save up that money!

659
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,940
How could someone who knows that think to steal other people's money?

660
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:26,220
Why shouldn't I?

661
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:31,400
Why can't I do that?

662
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:36,840
Why am I the only one who can't? Why, why, why?

663
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,530
Why am I the only one who can't?

664
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:41,030
Why!

665
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:52,360
Why can't I do that...

666
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,730
It's all true.

667
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:39,350
I committed fraud and got loans from loan sharks.

668
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:45,840
I grew up poor.

669
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:52,450
I thought it would be great once I start making money with my own hands,

670
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:59,320
but I couldn't keep up with those who grew up in a rich family.

671
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:03,470
I was jealous...

672
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:05,210
of that woman,

673
00:55:06,910 --> 00:55:09,300
She seemed to have everything.

674
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:25,480
 I know, So Won's mother.

675
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:27,760
 I wanted to meet with that woman, no matter what,

676
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,690
 and beg her to keep it a secret,

677
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:33,120
 but I couldn't meet with her.

678
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:46,650
I saw her put something in a locker.

679
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:55,850
What was that?

680
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:00,250
I can't tell you.

681
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,480
 Kang Do Joon thinks that I have it.

682
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:16,180
I used that to threaten him.

683
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:19,220
So I'm asking you, what is it!

684
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:23,780
USB.

685
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:33,440
Yu Jin was the one who hired someone to kill Kang Do Joon.

686
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:39,120
 The USB that contains that murder request information.

687
00:58:14,610 --> 00:58:17,650
♫  Time to end the night  ♫

688
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:23,640
♫  I don't know where the end is, but wake up anyway  ♫

689
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:27,240
♫  I'll protect myself from the ruins  ♫

690
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:30,150
♫  Don't be shy, it'll be fine  ♫

691
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:32,500
♫  Now, take down the walls, get go  ♫

692
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:35,410
♫  Time to end the night  ♫

693
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:39,120
♫  I'll find everything and let go  ♫

694
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:42,020
♫  The answer is right in front of me  ♫

695
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:44,990
♫  In a world where the lies are rampant  ♫

696
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:46,950
♫  I'll never hide it again, never  ♫

697
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:50,210
 Battle For Happiness

698
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:53,140
 Then why did Yu Jin die that day?

699
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:55,740
 What happened!

700
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:56,760
 Nothing.

701
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,840
 Deputy Manager, wait! Deputy Manager!

702
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,420
 How could you be like this?

703
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:02,240
 I asked what else was there?

704
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:05,940
 Was there really a black USB in the master bedroom drawers?

705
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:08,380
 Who are you to talk about whether I deserve to be their dad?

706
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:11,010
 But I'm not scared at all of someone like you.

707
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:13,050
 All you know how to do is something like this.

708
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:15,000
 Shut up!

709
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:23,670
 Do you really think Oh Yu Jin got rid of it?

710
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:26,340
 I asked, where is she!

711
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:27,940
 Come with me

712
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:30,270
 and let's talk.

713
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:35,830
 Why are you doing this?

714
00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:36,800
 Take this.

715
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:39,880
 It's a lawsuit filing for compensation from the husband's mistress.

716
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:40,860
 She stopped in the middle of her text.

717
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:43,510
 Check where Jang Mi Ho's phone turned off.

718
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:45,980
 Please turn off all the CCTVs for the underground parking lot, elevators,

719
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:48,220
 and clinic interior.

720
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:51,750
 An important customer is coming, and she said she's uncomfortable with them.
