 This is a work of fiction. Characters, locations, agencies, incidents, organizations, and jobs have no relation to real life.

00:00:48,614 --> 00:00:50,004

You crazy bastard.

12
00:00:50,004 --> 00:00:54,454

The videos of you doing meth and punching someone were released!

13
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:55,734
 So tell me quickly.

14
00:00:55,734 --> 00:00:58,404
 Where is that bastard Han Joon Gyeong?

 He even went to the nightclub before with Director Park.

18
00:01:09,474 --> 00:01:11,584
 Is there anything for her to find by digging around?

19
00:01:11,584 --> 00:01:14,774
 I don't like that woman Jang Mi Ho digging around!

00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:18,314

I'll send a girl. Have a drink before you go.

00:02:12,394 --> 00:02:13,904
Mother.

36
00:02:17,574 --> 00:02:19,314
You should take a seat.

00:02:27,334 --> 00:02:29,864
Who are you? Who are you to call me that?

38
00:02:29,864 --> 00:02:32,654
Why are you already scared?

39
00:02:32,654 --> 00:02:34,934
I haven't even said anything yet.

40
00:02:34,934 --> 00:02:37,454
I asked who you were!

41
00:02:37,454 --> 00:02:39,654

Just make one statement for me.

00:02:59,664 --> 00:03:04,754
Even when Yu Jin lived here, she must not have been herself.

47
00:03:13,834 --> 00:03:16,754
I came here knowing everything.

48
00:03:28,704 --> 00:03:34,194
I'm not such complete scum that I'd sell out my dead daughter over this petty cash.

49
00:04:00,884 --> 00:04:03,574
I told you I came here knowing everything.

00:04:06,324 --> 00:04:09,524

 I should have gone.

59
00:05:05,504 --> 00:05:08,184
 Don't think about anything for now, and sleep well tonight.

- Ms. Jang!

75
00:06:41,694 --> 00:06:43,304
- Hello!
 - I'm here.

76
00:06:43,304 --> 00:06:44,974
Aigoo! Assistant Manager Jang!

77
00:06:44,974 --> 00:06:46,424
Assistant Manager,

78
00:06:50,914 --> 00:06:52,154
welcome back!

79
00:06:52,154 --> 00:06:53,894
Finally, you're here!

80
00:06:56,994 --> 00:07:00,994
Assistant Manager Jang, I almost broke my neck, straining as I waited for your return.

81
00:07:00,994 --> 00:07:03,234
This division of tasks looks okay, right?

84
00:07:06,974 --> 00:07:11,744
All right. Here's all the kinds of work you enjoy.

85
00:07:19,294 --> 00:07:22,074
No. I'm not working like this anymore.

86
00:07:23,064 --> 00:07:24,834
Looks like you need to redo this.

87
00:07:24,834 --> 00:07:27,864
Why? Hey, what's with you? What happened?

88
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,504
Since it's before office hours, I'll go have coffee first.

89
00:07:30,504 --> 00:07:34,904
Oh, I have somewhere to go today, so I'm leaving early.

90
00:07:34,904 --> 00:07:36,164
- Hey, hey!
 - Assistant Manager!

91
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,604
Assistant Manager!

92
00:07:37,604 --> 00:07:40,514
Wh-What are we going to do?

93
00:07:49,074 --> 00:07:50,534
Why?

94
00:07:50,534 --> 00:07:53,154
Because I'm genuinely curious now

95
00:07:54,054 --> 00:07:56,714
what you're thinking.

96
00:07:56,714 --> 00:07:59,684
If you say it's all right, I wonder if that's really true.

97
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:10,494
Why are you carrying this around?

98
00:08:10,494 --> 00:08:12,054
You said you were scared yesterday

99
00:08:12,054 --> 00:08:14,274
to find out what you don't want to know.

100
00:08:14,274 --> 00:08:18,214
I'm scared. I might find out what I don't want to know.

101
00:08:19,584 --> 00:08:22,144
But I still have to find out what I need to know.

102
00:08:26,734 --> 00:08:28,384
 Despite the "I don't drink drugged beverages" CEO's apology,

103
00:08:28,384 --> 00:08:30,474
 the movement to boycott Inner Spirit beauty foods spreads.

104
00:08:30,474 --> 00:08:33,164
 Enterprise faltering due to SNS

105
00:08:35,554 --> 00:08:38,514
How could you suddenly withdraw your investment funds like that?

106
00:08:38,514 --> 00:08:41,904
We faced numerous crises like this while expanding Inner Spirit.

107
00:08:41,904 --> 00:08:43,704
If you just trust me this once—

108
00:08:43,704 --> 00:08:45,824
Mr. President! Mr—

109
00:08:52,814 --> 00:08:53,964
 Power off

110
00:09:00,154 --> 00:09:02,824
CEO Song, the bank just called.

111
00:09:02,824 --> 00:09:05,874
They said they couldn't offer an extension

112
00:09:05,874 --> 00:09:08,104
for the 800 million won in operating funds.

113
00:09:10,194 --> 00:09:10,924
 Reduction in labor force, Factory sale

114
00:09:13,074 --> 00:09:17,024
Even if we sell the factory, we'll be 3 billion won short.

115
00:09:51,444 --> 00:09:54,304
Su Bin, I didn't bring my car.

116
00:09:54,304 --> 00:09:56,234
I felt like walking.

117
00:09:58,714 --> 00:10:01,564
You go ahead and have lunch.

118
00:10:10,424 --> 00:10:13,644
Mrs. Song! It's been a while.

119
00:10:13,644 --> 00:10:16,084
Oh, yes.

120
00:10:16,084 --> 00:10:18,114
I didn't know I'd run into you here.

121
00:10:18,114 --> 00:10:21,404
I quit the kindergarten and was taking a break. But then Mrs. Kim called me.

122
00:10:21,404 --> 00:10:24,264
So I ended up looking after Ah Rin.

123
00:10:24,264 --> 00:10:25,914
Oh, I see.

124
00:10:25,914 --> 00:10:27,514
Ah Rin, let's go.

125
00:10:31,024 --> 00:10:32,724
Na Yeong!

126
00:10:35,744 --> 00:10:37,404
Mom!

127
00:11:12,284 --> 00:11:15,254
Oh, Noona! You're home.

128
00:11:15,254 --> 00:11:17,184
We opened this one!

129
00:11:18,134 --> 00:11:21,414
Is this a time for you guys to be day drinking?

130
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:25,214
You want to do this when you might get arrested?

131
00:11:26,234 --> 00:11:29,714
We were supposed to meet to discuss what we're going to do.

132
00:11:31,764 --> 00:11:33,384
Clean this up.

133
00:11:33,384 --> 00:11:35,954
You, too, dear. Stop that and sit down.

134
00:11:37,414 --> 00:11:39,154
We don't have enough snacks.

135
00:11:39,154 --> 00:11:41,094
Can't we discuss it after we eat?

136
00:11:41,094 --> 00:11:43,324
And what would Brother-in-law know even if he heard it?

137
00:11:43,324 --> 00:11:44,734
I know right.

138
00:11:51,504 --> 00:11:54,264
What did you guys say to your brother-in-law?

139
00:11:56,654 --> 00:11:59,264
I said, what did you say to your brother-in-law?

140
00:12:01,704 --> 00:12:03,454
For the past 20 years,

141
00:12:03,454 --> 00:12:07,614
I have lived while taking responsibility for you guys because of Mom and Dad's will.

142
00:12:09,024 --> 00:12:12,204
Because I'm the oldest. Because I'm your older sister.

143
00:12:12,204 --> 00:12:16,784
Taking care of you guys in place of the two people who passed on.

144
00:12:16,784 --> 00:12:19,624
I thought that was the obviously right thing to do. I believed it was my duty.

145
00:12:19,624 --> 00:12:23,394
But what's the use if I'm the only one fulfilling my duty?

146
00:12:24,264 --> 00:12:25,904
Am I just your ATM?

147
00:12:25,904 --> 00:12:30,384
How little you must've thought of me to

148
00:12:30,384 --> 00:12:32,394
look down on my husband like this.

149
00:12:35,844 --> 00:12:39,874
How much longer must I spend my life cleaning up after your mess?

150
00:12:40,864 --> 00:12:43,874
Noona, why are you being like this all of a sudden?

151
00:12:43,874 --> 00:12:45,354
First, calm down.

152
00:12:45,354 --> 00:12:48,814
Shut up before I rip that mouth of yours off!

153
00:12:48,814 --> 00:12:51,894
From now on, you guys take care of your own lives!

154
00:12:51,894 --> 00:12:53,814
I don't have any money to give you

155
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:56,814
and I won't give you a penny going forward.

156
00:12:56,814 --> 00:12:58,844
Get out immediately.

157
00:13:00,324 --> 00:13:03,394
I said, get lost! Now!

158
00:13:43,294 --> 00:13:45,724
How are you so unaffected?

159
00:13:47,854 --> 00:13:50,634
Why do you always get taken advantage of?

160
00:13:50,634 --> 00:13:52,864
Who are those jerks to say anything?

161
00:14:02,254 --> 00:14:07,194
Well, it's not because I like being treated like that.

162
00:14:07,194 --> 00:14:11,894
It's just because you care for your brothers so much.

163
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:15,404
But still, you could have said something.

164
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:19,934
Well...

165
00:14:20,884 --> 00:14:24,074
you think I had a hard time holding it in.

166
00:14:24,074 --> 00:14:25,614
But...

167
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:29,634
I let it go because I was able to tolerate it.

168
00:14:31,664 --> 00:14:33,474
Why are you being like that?

169
00:14:33,474 --> 00:14:35,194
Su Bin.

170
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:40,194
We have to sell this house.

171
00:14:43,244 --> 00:14:47,554
It's going to be very difficult from now on.

172
00:14:49,074 --> 00:14:53,374
Our company, our employees...

173
00:14:54,914 --> 00:14:57,554
I don't think I can give up on them.

174
00:14:59,194 --> 00:15:00,864
It's all right.

175
00:15:02,184 --> 00:15:04,494
Do what you want to do.

176
00:15:49,174 --> 00:15:50,894
Su Bin.

177
00:16:08,054 --> 00:16:10,394
 Knock it off!

178
00:16:13,831 --> 00:16:16,541
I don't have any more money to give you.

179
00:16:18,768 --> 00:16:21,221
Who's going to believe you?

180
00:16:21,221 --> 00:16:25,221
I'm telling you, I don't have anything to do with that woman!

181
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,331
 DGB Financial Group

182
00:16:42,111 --> 00:16:44,701
 Division of Tasks: This is today's work schedule. Team Leader, please confirm.

183
00:16:44,701 --> 00:16:45,931
 Send

184
00:16:45,931 --> 00:16:49,191
 Jang Mi Ho: Division of Tasks

185
00:16:55,651 --> 00:16:57,461
I'll get going first.

186
00:16:57,461 --> 00:17:00,621
- Yes, yes.
 - I'm off. See you all tomorrow.

187
00:17:14,021 --> 00:17:15,671
 Sim Hye Jeong

188
00:17:31,421 --> 00:17:32,981
 Marilyn

189
00:17:46,571 --> 00:17:48,341
Hello!

190
00:17:49,521 --> 00:17:51,981
Is anyone there?

191
00:17:53,891 --> 00:17:56,161
We're not open yet.

192
00:17:57,891 --> 00:18:00,061
I came to see Sim Hye Jeong.

193
00:18:00,061 --> 00:18:01,931
Is she here right now?

194
00:18:03,251 --> 00:18:05,201
Why?

195
00:18:05,201 --> 00:18:08,301
- I have something to check with her.
 - Sh*t, a cop!

196
00:18:09,281 --> 00:18:11,011
Wait!

197
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,981
Hold on!

198
00:18:14,881 --> 00:18:17,001
Sim Hye Jeong!

199
00:18:49,001 --> 00:18:51,131
Excuse me!

200
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:57,721
This is my bag.

201
00:18:59,941 --> 00:19:02,581
So, who told you to just leave it anywhere?

202
00:19:02,581 --> 00:19:05,151
Isn't it the fault of the person who left it behind?

203
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:09,491
You're not giving me a reward?

204
00:19:09,491 --> 00:19:12,711
Why should I give you a reward? What did you do?

205
00:19:12,711 --> 00:19:14,941
What bad luck before work starts.

206
00:19:14,941 --> 00:19:17,371
If you're not going to pay, get lost.

207
00:19:19,521 --> 00:19:23,621
By chance, do you know someone named Sim Hye Jeong?

208
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:29,741
What is it about?

209
00:19:29,741 --> 00:19:31,741
I have some things to ask her.

210
00:19:31,741 --> 00:19:33,171
There's no one here by that name.

211
00:19:33,171 --> 00:19:35,461
Don't hang around here and go.

212
00:19:35,461 --> 00:19:37,551
- Excuse me.
 - I told you to go!

213
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,641
Can't you hear me telling you to get lost?

214
00:19:46,501 --> 00:19:47,781
Boss! Ms. Sim!

215
00:19:47,781 --> 00:19:50,841
 Could you change these with 10,000 won bills?

216
00:19:53,311 --> 00:19:55,091
Sim Hye Jeong?

217
00:19:59,411 --> 00:20:02,861
You're the one who sent this to Oh Yu Jin, right?

218
00:20:04,801 --> 00:20:07,481
What is this key? Why did you send this to her?

219
00:20:07,481 --> 00:20:09,291
And what does this note mean?

220
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,951
I came here because I wanted to know the answers to those questions.

221
00:20:11,951 --> 00:20:13,341
Then, who are you?

222
00:20:13,341 --> 00:20:16,021
How do you have this package in your possession?

223
00:20:16,021 --> 00:20:19,281
Shouldn't you disclose that first?

224
00:20:19,281 --> 00:20:21,471
I'm sorry. I'm...

225
00:20:23,401 --> 00:20:26,981
I'm Yu Jin's friend.

226
00:20:26,981 --> 00:20:31,061
I discovered this box that someone left outside her door yesterday.

227
00:20:32,061 --> 00:20:34,061
- Yesterday?
 - Yes.

228
00:20:34,061 --> 00:20:36,931
You sent it on December 4th, right?

229
00:20:39,351 --> 00:20:41,991
I don't know why this package arrived only yesterday,

230
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:45,201
but there are so many things that are bothering me.

231
00:20:45,201 --> 00:20:47,841
You know what happened to Yu Jin, right?

232
00:20:47,841 --> 00:20:50,431
Yes, why wouldn't I?

233
00:20:50,431 --> 00:20:52,951
Yu Jin left this with me before.

234
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:55,441
I don't know what the key is for.

235
00:20:56,651 --> 00:20:59,121
Then why did you send this back to her?

236
00:20:59,121 --> 00:21:01,151
What about this note? You wrote it yourself, right?

237
00:21:01,151 --> 00:21:02,971
Before talking about that,

238
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:05,521
what is your relation to Yu Jin?

239
00:21:19,881 --> 00:21:22,351
Why should I tell you that?

240
00:21:23,601 --> 00:21:24,451
Excuse me?

241
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:27,431
Friend? What a load of crap.

242
00:21:27,431 --> 00:21:30,661
- Actually, I'm Yu Jin's—
- How do I know your true intentions?

243
00:21:30,661 --> 00:21:33,381
How do I even know if you stole this package or not!

244
00:21:33,381 --> 00:21:35,441
I'm actually Yu Jin's legal sister.

245
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:37,601
You know Yu Jin's incident is still under investigation, right?

246
00:21:37,601 --> 00:21:39,001
- If this—
 - See?

247
00:21:39,001 --> 00:21:40,461
You keep changing your story.

248
00:21:40,461 --> 00:21:42,801
At first, you said you were her friend.

249
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:46,391
Get lost before I report you for theft.

250
00:21:46,391 --> 00:21:48,871
- Ms. Sim.
 - I told you to get lost!

251
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,671
Hold on.

252
00:21:59,271 --> 00:22:02,291
 We only dated for a couple of months.

253
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:06,061
 But there were so many strange things when we were dating.

254
00:22:06,061 --> 00:22:07,681
 She lied easily.

255
00:22:07,681 --> 00:22:11,851
 At first, I thought she was the daughter of a very wealthy family.

256
00:22:11,851 --> 00:22:13,271
What do you think?

257
00:22:14,731 --> 00:22:16,491
That's not bad.

258
00:22:16,491 --> 00:22:19,881
Due to the scandalous incident during her high school years, Oh Yu Jin

259
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:22,061
suffered a mental breakdown.

260
00:22:22,061 --> 00:22:25,501
As a result, she developed an anxiety disorder, delusions,

261
00:22:25,501 --> 00:22:27,961
and lived with a sense of victimization.

262
00:22:27,961 --> 00:22:30,901
Then, she met Jang Mi Ho, the one who caused the incident.

263
00:22:30,901 --> 00:22:35,711
Oh Yu Jin fell into a critical mental state and tried to harm herself.

264
00:22:35,711 --> 00:22:38,111
And while Kang Do Joon tried to stop her,

265
00:22:38,111 --> 00:22:44,161
Oh Yu Jin ended up stabbing herself accidentally.

266
00:22:47,641 --> 00:22:49,831
You have to acknowledge this as the truth.

267
00:22:49,831 --> 00:22:51,081
It's even better if you believe it.

268
00:22:51,081 --> 00:22:53,551
What do you mean by "believe it"?

269
00:22:53,551 --> 00:22:55,521
What are you telling me to believe?

270
00:22:55,521 --> 00:22:57,451
That's the truth.

271
00:22:58,501 --> 00:23:00,801
Weren't there any psychiatric counseling records on Yu Jin,

272
00:23:00,801 --> 00:23:03,131
like drug prescriptions? That would be perfect.

273
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,441
I'll check on that.

274
00:23:04,441 --> 00:23:08,751
Anyway, meet all of Oh Yu Jin's old friends and coworkers to collect more statements.

275
00:23:08,751 --> 00:23:11,301
Let them mention Jang Mi Ho's name and that things were difficult.

276
00:23:11,301 --> 00:23:14,771
We just need a few words from the witnesses saying that they've heard about their issues.

277
00:23:26,241 --> 00:23:27,881
What is it?

278
00:23:29,931 --> 00:23:33,221
That woman, Jang Mi Ho. She came by.

279
00:23:37,301 --> 00:23:40,691
A woman named Jang Mi Ho may come to see you.

280
00:23:43,111 --> 00:23:44,881
Don't tell her anything.

281
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:47,461
So what? I told you she would.

282
00:23:47,461 --> 00:23:49,521
 She brought the key!

283
00:23:53,201 --> 00:23:56,991
Before she died, she gave me a key to hold onto,

284
00:23:56,991 --> 00:24:00,671
even though I mailed it back to her because I had a bad feeling.

285
00:24:01,681 --> 00:24:03,541
 How does she have the key?

286
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:05,421
How would I know that?

287
00:24:05,421 --> 00:24:09,731
So, why did you even send that in the first place and complicate things?

288
00:24:09,731 --> 00:24:13,201
Do you know how long it's been since I sent that package?

289
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:19,461
Jang Mi Ho said that someone left the package yesterday.

290
00:24:26,761 --> 00:24:30,171
It seems there's something you haven't told me.

291
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:50,271
Mind your own business, will you?

292
00:24:57,331 --> 00:25:00,121
 You sent it on December 4th, right?

293
00:25:05,941 --> 00:25:07,311
 The package you mailed to Oh Yu Jin was delivered on December 5, 2022.

294
00:25:07,311 --> 00:25:10,141
December 5th.

295
00:25:12,771 --> 00:25:16,111
 The time of death is estimated to have been around 9 p.m. on December 5th.

296
00:25:21,171 --> 00:25:28,611
 December 5th

297
00:25:58,201 --> 00:26:01,301
 What happened to the package? Did you take it that day?

298
00:26:02,301 --> 00:26:04,761
 Why did you take it back there?

299
00:26:04,761 --> 00:26:06,621
 So, why did you break your promise? Did you forget already?

300
00:26:06,621 --> 00:26:08,841
Shit.

301
00:26:11,391 --> 00:26:14,031
 What if Jang Mi Ho catches on and starts digging around?

302
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:17,771
 If that woman finds out everything, you and I are both finished.

303
00:26:26,601 --> 00:26:29,051
 Are you the real...
 Detective Bae Chang Hoon

304
00:26:29,051 --> 00:26:30,631
What's this?

305
00:26:31,491 --> 00:26:33,261
Shit.

306
00:26:40,191 --> 00:26:42,171
What's going on?

307
00:26:42,171 --> 00:26:47,281
 Kang Do Joon, please come in to be interrogated as a suspect in the investigation of Oh Yu Jin's death.

308
00:26:47,281 --> 00:26:48,671
Again?

309
00:26:52,601 --> 00:26:54,991
How much longer will you torment me like this?

310
00:26:54,991 --> 00:26:57,201
 When can you come in?

311
00:26:57,201 --> 00:27:00,101
 How's 10 am on the 17th?

312
00:27:00,101 --> 00:27:04,001
 I'll take no response as your agreement. We'll see you then.

313
00:27:09,801 --> 00:27:11,441
Damn it!

314
00:27:18,051 --> 00:27:22,721
 Let me know when you're ready.

315
00:27:58,891 --> 00:28:00,971
You should take a break.

316
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:03,741
Again? We just had one earlier, too.

317
00:28:03,741 --> 00:28:06,271
I prepared dinner, so please have some before you leave.

318
00:28:06,271 --> 00:28:08,911
I feel bad bothering you like this each time.

319
00:28:08,911 --> 00:28:11,021
It's no bother.

320
00:28:12,201 --> 00:28:14,471
Ah Rin, eat a lot, okay?

321
00:28:14,471 --> 00:28:17,291
Here, one more. Meat.

322
00:28:17,291 --> 00:28:18,931
This one, too.

323
00:28:21,851 --> 00:28:25,451
How come you're not eating? You didn't eat last time, either.

324
00:28:25,451 --> 00:28:27,551
I'll eat when my husband gets home.

325
00:28:27,551 --> 00:28:30,401
He gets so hurt when I eat without him.

326
00:28:30,401 --> 00:28:32,351
Oh, I see.

327
00:28:32,351 --> 00:28:37,361
Even though he doesn't seem that way, he can't do anything without me.

328
00:28:37,361 --> 00:28:41,251
Sometimes, he's more high maintenance than Ah Rin.

329
00:28:43,651 --> 00:28:47,871
I don't know why, but my stomach's not feeling well these days.

330
00:28:47,871 --> 00:28:50,501
I'm not sure why.

331
00:28:50,501 --> 00:28:52,641
Oh, I see.

332
00:28:54,471 --> 00:28:58,581
 But Ms. Jo, you're not eating well.

333
00:28:58,581 --> 00:29:01,821
 My stomach has been bothering me lately.

334
00:29:01,821 --> 00:29:04,781
 You're not eating well, either, ma'am.

335
00:29:04,781 --> 00:29:07,501
 I'm not feeling well lately, either.

336
00:29:17,461 --> 00:29:18,921
What's wrong?

337
00:29:18,921 --> 00:29:20,641
One moment.

338
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:50,691
Is something wrong?

339
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:56,211
I don't feel well all of a sudden. I have to leave.

340
00:30:01,551 --> 00:30:04,631
 Our Hope Obstetrics and Gynecology

341
00:30:15,301 --> 00:30:16,681
 Ladies

342
00:30:36,231 --> 00:30:37,921
Eat lots.

343
00:30:42,431 --> 00:30:44,571
What happened? Huh!

344
00:30:44,571 --> 00:30:46,031
What's going on now?

345
00:30:46,031 --> 00:30:47,731
That woman!

346
00:30:49,961 --> 00:30:52,971
Your wife is pregnant.

347
00:30:52,971 --> 00:30:54,021
What?

348
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:56,091
You said you didn't even touch her.

349
00:30:56,091 --> 00:30:59,321
You said you'd do the bare minimum, so how could she get pregnant?

350
00:30:59,321 --> 00:31:00,981
What are you talking about?

351
00:31:00,981 --> 00:31:02,121
What do you mean, pregnant?

352
00:31:02,121 --> 00:31:05,271
How should I know, Oppa? You tell me!

353
00:31:05,271 --> 00:31:07,041
What are you going to do now!

354
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:10,001
Hold on. I'll call you later.

355
00:31:13,001 --> 00:31:14,021
 My Prince

356
00:31:21,261 --> 00:31:25,451
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail.

357
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:27,131
Shit.

358
00:32:25,071 --> 00:32:26,801
Hey, what are you doing?

359
00:32:26,801 --> 00:32:30,871
I'm writing up an announcement for interdepartmental cooperation for the internal creative contest.

360
00:32:30,871 --> 00:32:32,391
I mean, what are you doing at this hour?

361
00:32:32,391 --> 00:32:34,251
I have to leave early today, too.

362
00:32:34,251 --> 00:32:38,461
You confirmed my flex hours for 6:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. yesterday.

363
00:32:38,461 --> 00:32:40,081
Oh, did I?

364
00:32:40,081 --> 00:32:44,111
Regarding Hongbu Marketing's fee waiver promo that I talked to you about yesterday.

365
00:32:44,111 --> 00:32:49,471
As of now, it is only advertised that there is no fee on this screen.

366
00:32:49,471 --> 00:32:54,301
How about we create a pop-up on the app's screen at the beginning?

367
00:32:54,301 --> 00:32:55,491
Yes, do that then.

368
00:32:55,491 --> 00:32:57,801
Okay. I'll do that sir.

369
00:32:57,801 --> 00:33:02,721
Also, our strong point is that you can transfer a large amount at once.

370
00:33:02,721 --> 00:33:04,011
Include that in the wording, too.

371
00:33:04,011 --> 00:33:07,061
All right, I got it. Please give me your approval, too.

372
00:33:11,701 --> 00:33:15,861
Yes, ma'am, I have a training session at the headquarters.

373
00:33:21,721 --> 00:33:23,631
I'll see you tomorrow.

374
00:34:16,451 --> 00:34:19,611
 Marilyn

375
00:34:34,671 --> 00:34:35,881
Hello.

376
00:34:35,881 --> 00:34:37,591
Welcome.

377
00:34:37,591 --> 00:34:38,871
What would you like to do?

378
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:40,371
Of course.

379
00:34:40,371 --> 00:34:45,041
Where else would their workers get perms and dry their hair?

380
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,731
Then you must have known that owner for a long time, right?

381
00:34:47,731 --> 00:34:52,511
We've been in business in this area together for about 25 years now.

382
00:34:52,511 --> 00:34:57,521
But didn't you go see Ms. Sim before?

383
00:34:57,521 --> 00:34:59,121
Yes.

384
00:34:59,121 --> 00:35:00,991
About what?

385
00:35:02,731 --> 00:35:04,921
I can't tell you that.

386
00:35:05,891 --> 00:35:09,621
Are you here because of that woman, too?

387
00:35:17,211 --> 00:35:20,081
When was she here?

388
00:35:20,081 --> 00:35:22,941
About two months ago?

389
00:35:22,941 --> 00:35:28,141
The detectives were here quite bit because of her.

390
00:35:28,141 --> 00:35:29,931
She's the dead woman, right?

391
00:35:29,931 --> 00:35:32,461
I heard she's Ms. Sim's daughter.

392
00:35:38,601 --> 00:35:40,201
Her daughter?

393
00:35:40,201 --> 00:35:42,551
I don't know! But that's what rumors say.

394
00:35:42,551 --> 00:35:46,291
 Apparently, the laundromat owner overheard the detectives talking about it.

395
00:35:48,181 --> 00:35:50,651
Sim Hye Jeong!

396
00:35:50,651 --> 00:35:53,041
Sim Hye Jeong! Are you there?

397
00:35:56,711 --> 00:35:58,481
 Closed today

398
00:36:02,801 --> 00:36:07,301
 Pyeongju Terminal

399
00:36:11,351 --> 00:36:13,991
 You know what happened to Yu Jin, right?

400
00:36:13,991 --> 00:36:16,681
 Of course. Why wouldn't I know.

401
00:36:16,681 --> 00:36:19,271
 Yu Jin left this with me before.

402
00:36:19,271 --> 00:36:21,821
 I don't know what the key is for.

403
00:36:53,091 --> 00:36:54,471
 Mom

404
00:37:01,491 --> 00:37:02,811
 Hi, my daughter!

405
00:37:02,811 --> 00:37:05,461
Mom, what are you doing?

406
00:37:07,231 --> 00:37:09,561
I had nothing to do, so I was reading a book.

407
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,161
It's Friday. What's my daughter doing?

408
00:37:13,351 --> 00:37:16,121
Nothing much. Every day is the same.

409
00:37:16,121 --> 00:37:18,361
 I decided to leave this place the day after tomorrow.

410
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:21,111
 It's so stifling I can hardly bear it.

411
00:37:21,111 --> 00:37:23,751
Aunt Jin Sook will drive me to Gapyeong.

412
00:37:23,751 --> 00:37:25,141
You'll come too, right?

413
00:37:25,141 --> 00:37:27,951
Y-Yes. Of course, I should go.

414
00:37:27,951 --> 00:37:30,451
What's wrong with your voice?

415
00:37:30,451 --> 00:37:32,801
Did something happen?

416
00:37:32,801 --> 00:37:35,071
Actually, Mom.

417
00:37:35,071 --> 00:37:38,901
Is there anything you know about Yu Jin's birth mom?

418
00:37:38,901 --> 00:37:41,151
 I have something to ask you about her.

419
00:37:43,671 --> 00:37:46,921
You have a knack for making me speechless sometimes!

420
00:37:46,921 --> 00:37:49,301
Why are you asking such a question?

421
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:52,971
I didn't mean anything by it.

422
00:37:52,971 --> 00:37:56,741
Why should I care about my ex-husband's ex-wife's situation?

423
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:59,141
If you called to ask about that, let's hang up.

424
00:38:46,531 --> 00:38:48,951
 Who will believe you?

425
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:53,181
 I really have nothing to do with that woman!

426
00:38:53,181 --> 00:38:55,871
- Su Bin.
 - Yeah?

427
00:38:55,871 --> 00:38:58,121
Do you have anything to tell me?

428
00:39:01,461 --> 00:39:03,131
Oh. About the bank loan?

429
00:39:03,131 --> 00:39:04,401
Don't worry too much.

430
00:39:04,401 --> 00:39:07,141
I'm looking into other places with Mr. Park.

431
00:39:08,151 --> 00:39:11,271
Despite the risks, if the revenue is high,

432
00:39:11,271 --> 00:39:14,611
there are many banks who are more than willing to give out loans.

433
00:39:17,091 --> 00:39:20,891
Just trust me, honey. Please?

434
00:40:08,181 --> 00:40:11,071
 Youngest Brother-in-law Song Jeong Sik

435
00:40:11,761 --> 00:40:13,581
 Straw

436
00:40:20,641 --> 00:40:23,241
Hey. Do you have it ready?

437
00:40:25,241 --> 00:40:27,191
 Why aren't you talking, punk? You called me.

438
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:28,851
 I asked if it was ready.

439
00:40:28,851 --> 00:40:31,191
What does he have to get ready?

440
00:40:33,851 --> 00:40:36,931
Wh-Why are you calling from Brother-in-law's phone?

441
00:40:36,931 --> 00:40:40,101
Do you normally talk to Su Bin like that?

442
00:40:43,391 --> 00:40:45,301
So what if I talk to him that way?

443
00:40:45,301 --> 00:40:48,781
What's that got to do with you? You told me to get lost!

444
00:40:48,781 --> 00:40:50,201
You're the one who cut me off.

445
00:40:50,201 --> 00:40:53,141
 You were on the phone with Su Bin last night, weren't you?

446
00:40:54,391 --> 00:40:55,711
 You guys were talking about a woman.

447
00:40:55,711 --> 00:40:57,661
What woman?

448
00:40:59,531 --> 00:41:02,561
- Why?
 - Just answer me. What woman?

449
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:05,501
Why should I tell you that, Noona?

450
00:41:05,501 --> 00:41:06,911
That's the key to my personal wallet.

451
00:41:06,911 --> 00:41:09,181
- You!
  - Didn't you say I'm on my own now?

452
00:41:09,181 --> 00:41:11,971
I need to find a way to eat and live, don't I?

453
00:41:11,971 --> 00:41:14,041
Don't call me anymore.

454
00:41:58,521 --> 00:42:01,821
- You crazy bitch!
 - You're Yu Jin's birth mom, aren't you?

455
00:42:05,911 --> 00:42:07,491
Why didn't you tell me?

456
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:10,931
How do I know what you're scheming?

457
00:42:10,931 --> 00:42:12,911
Jang Mi Ho.

458
00:42:14,061 --> 00:42:17,041
I remember who you are now.

459
00:42:18,031 --> 00:42:23,201
I don't have any intention of playing the role of a mother.

460
00:42:24,331 --> 00:42:27,761
But you're really thick-skinned, aren't you?

461
00:42:29,761 --> 00:42:32,901
You forgot you threw her out like trash.

462
00:42:32,901 --> 00:42:35,351
Why are you digging up a dead girl's background now?

463
00:42:35,351 --> 00:42:38,291
I'm not digging up anything! I told you!

464
00:42:38,291 --> 00:42:41,861
I think there's a connection between the package and Yu Jin's death!

465
00:42:41,861 --> 00:42:43,361
Sim Hye...

466
00:42:44,601 --> 00:42:47,661
Mother, aren't you lying because you're guilty about something?

467
00:42:47,661 --> 00:42:49,901
Are you playing detective?

468
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:53,121
Look here, Jang Mi Ho. Why didn't you look further into the past instead?

469
00:42:53,121 --> 00:42:56,591
If you know what you did to Yu Jin,

470
00:42:56,591 --> 00:43:01,771
you couldn't have come to see me like this using Yu Jin's name.

471
00:43:03,281 --> 00:43:04,431
What are you talking about?

472
00:43:04,431 --> 00:43:06,881
Don't act like you don't know. Don't ever show up here again.

473
00:43:06,881 --> 00:43:10,491
Before I gouge out your eyeballs!

474
00:43:11,731 --> 00:43:14,351
Yu Jin's mother! Wait a minute.

475
00:43:15,241 --> 00:43:17,741
Wait a minute. Yu Jin's mother!

476
00:43:20,601 --> 00:43:21,531
How dare you follow me!

477
00:43:21,531 --> 00:43:23,811
What is it that I did to Yu Jin?

478
00:43:23,811 --> 00:43:25,511
What else do I need to know?

479
00:43:25,511 --> 00:43:28,371
What is it that I didn't know?

480
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:35,331
You lived a comfortable life all this time.

481
00:43:35,331 --> 00:43:37,811
Like a plant in a greenhouse.

482
00:43:40,841 --> 00:43:42,861
You really want to know?

483
00:44:07,941 --> 00:44:13,791
This is the room Yu Jin used for two years after she graduated high school.

484
00:44:13,791 --> 00:44:17,191
She lived like a rat in a place like this

485
00:44:17,191 --> 00:44:19,161
thanks to someone.

486
00:44:20,061 --> 00:44:23,101
Yu Jin used to live here?

487
00:44:23,101 --> 00:44:24,531
Why do you pretend like you don't know?

488
00:44:24,531 --> 00:44:28,881
Your amazing mother abused her like a dog and then kicked her out.

489
00:44:28,881 --> 00:44:30,701
There's no way.

490
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:32,311
When did my mom do that?

491
00:44:32,311 --> 00:44:35,471
You had an affair and abandoned Yu Jin!

492
00:44:37,101 --> 00:44:39,281
I'm speechless.

493
00:44:39,281 --> 00:44:42,750
Who told you that? Your mother?

494
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:46,401
She's a shameless bitch until the end, isn't she?

495
00:44:46,401 --> 00:44:51,311
Your mother's the one who had an affair with my husband.

496
00:44:51,311 --> 00:44:56,761
It wasn't enough that she abused my daughter. She made up such nonsense, too?

497
00:44:56,761 --> 00:44:59,951
Wait a minute. What are you saying?

498
00:44:59,951 --> 00:45:02,591
What do you mean she had an affair with your husband?

499
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:04,661
How could you not know that?

500
00:45:04,661 --> 00:45:10,101
Your mother and Yu Jin's father were having an affair even before they remarried.

501
00:45:10,101 --> 00:45:11,421
Please don't lie.

502
00:45:11,421 --> 00:45:15,211
Do you know where I got the money to open this place?

503
00:45:15,211 --> 00:45:19,161
With the money that Yu Jin's father gave me for alimony.

504
00:45:19,161 --> 00:45:23,951
Why would such a stingy man give me that much money?

505
00:45:28,721 --> 00:45:32,131
Teacher, you must know very well since you're an educator.

506
00:45:32,131 --> 00:45:35,991
There's not much you can do about a child's inherited disposition.

507
00:45:35,991 --> 00:45:41,301
You know her mother had an affair with a younger man, right?

508
00:45:42,631 --> 00:45:46,211
Mom, what did you just say?

509
00:45:46,211 --> 00:45:48,911
How dare you interrupt a conversation between adults?

510
00:45:48,911 --> 00:45:52,521
 At least Yu Jin knew the truth.

511
00:45:52,521 --> 00:45:54,351
What about you?

512
00:45:59,961 --> 00:46:01,961
Why did you come here?

513
00:46:01,961 --> 00:46:04,961
My life is ruined because of you!

514
00:46:04,961 --> 00:46:07,511
If only you'd disappear!

515
00:46:07,511 --> 00:46:09,231
Leave!

516
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,501
I'll tell them everything!

517
00:46:19,501 --> 00:46:22,251
I'm going to tell them the whole thing!

518
00:46:26,401 --> 00:46:28,351
 You say you didn't know?

519
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,961
 Don't make me laugh.

520
00:46:29,961 --> 00:46:32,921
 If you wanted to know, you could've found out everything!

521
00:46:32,921 --> 00:46:35,601
 After her father's business failed...

522
00:46:35,601 --> 00:46:39,151
- Where's the seal?
- See if there's any cash!

523
00:46:42,651 --> 00:46:44,731
Where is the money!

524
00:46:45,641 --> 00:46:48,601
 When Yu Jin was chased by debt collectors...

525
00:46:51,611 --> 00:46:53,290
Mi Ho!

526
00:46:53,921 --> 00:46:56,021
Mi Ho!

527
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:58,381
 She called you.

528
00:46:58,381 --> 00:47:00,191
Don't you remember?

529
00:47:02,341 --> 00:47:04,211
I didn't get the call. I really didn't know!

530
00:47:04,211 --> 00:47:06,441
Not knowing is a sin, too!

531
00:47:20,181 --> 00:47:22,281
What is this?

532
00:48:03,811 --> 00:48:06,851
 As they say, don't take in animals with black hair.

533
00:48:06,851 --> 00:48:09,051
 Just look at me.

534
00:48:09,051 --> 00:48:11,221
 You can't hide the stock that someone is from.

535
00:48:29,311 --> 00:48:31,371
I must've been here a while.

536
00:48:31,371 --> 00:48:34,251
I have so many things to take.

537
00:48:34,251 --> 00:48:36,701
No, no, no. Everything will fit in my suitcase.

538
00:48:36,701 --> 00:48:39,681
Hyeon Sook doesn't need to come—only you, Jin Sook.

539
00:48:39,681 --> 00:48:42,971
That's right. See you tomorrow.

540
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:45,411
Is your daughter coming tomorrow?

541
00:48:45,411 --> 00:48:46,831
Of course.

542
00:48:46,831 --> 00:48:49,821
I told her not to, but she insisted on coming.

543
00:48:49,821 --> 00:48:51,651
Leaving the hospital is not a big deal.

544
00:48:51,651 --> 00:48:54,291
Why do you keep calling your busy daughter?

545
00:48:54,291 --> 00:48:56,181
What do you mean, busy?

546
00:48:56,181 --> 00:48:57,951
Her mother's leaving the hospital.

547
00:48:57,951 --> 00:48:59,641
What could be more important than that?

548
00:48:59,641 --> 00:49:01,531
Oh, what's going on?

549
00:49:01,531 --> 00:49:03,721
You didn't say you were coming?

550
00:49:08,941 --> 00:49:11,601
What's wrong with you? Oh, my goodness.

551
00:49:11,601 --> 00:49:14,461
Mi Ho! Jang Mi Ho! Mi Ho!

552
00:49:14,461 --> 00:49:19,280
Stop. Stop! I told you to stop!

553
00:49:39,891 --> 00:49:41,891
How dare you!

554
00:49:41,891 --> 00:49:45,261
How dare you do this to me?

555
00:49:51,261 --> 00:49:53,431
Mom.

556
00:49:53,431 --> 00:49:55,111
It's not true, right?

557
00:49:55,111 --> 00:49:56,631
Speak clearly so I can understand.

558
00:49:56,631 --> 00:49:58,051
Mom.

559
00:49:59,051 --> 00:50:01,651
You weren't having an affair with Stepdad

560
00:50:01,851 --> 00:50:04,281
before he got divorced, right?

561
00:50:10,291 --> 00:50:11,941
It was true, then?

562
00:50:14,281 --> 00:50:16,181
It was true!

563
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:20,941
How could you do that!

564
00:50:20,941 --> 00:50:23,361
It was actually you and Stepdad who had been having an affair!

565
00:50:23,361 --> 00:50:26,241
How could you say it was Yu Jin's mother who had the affair?

566
00:50:26,241 --> 00:50:27,731
What are you talking about?

567
00:50:27,731 --> 00:50:30,551
Where did you hear such nonsense!

568
00:50:31,701 --> 00:50:34,361
- I've never done such a thing.
 - Mom, are you even human?

569
00:50:34,361 --> 00:50:37,741
How could you be so shameless!

570
00:50:37,741 --> 00:50:41,461
You and I are perpetrators to Yu Jin!

571
00:50:41,461 --> 00:50:43,411
I heard when Yu Jin was hounded by debt collectors,

572
00:50:43,411 --> 00:50:45,201
you kicked her out with only 300,000 won!

573
00:50:45,201 --> 00:50:46,871
After throwing her out like that,

574
00:50:46,871 --> 00:50:49,311
how could you say something like that about her!

575
00:50:49,311 --> 00:50:51,981
I said that's not true!

576
00:50:51,981 --> 00:50:55,841
Up until now, I lived not knowing I was a perpetrator.

577
00:50:55,841 --> 00:50:58,551
 You don't say anything to Yu Jin. Why are you picking on me?

578
00:50:58,551 --> 00:51:01,041
 You and Yu Jin aren't the same.

579
00:51:01,041 --> 00:51:04,921
 Why is Mom just picking on me and not you?

580
00:51:04,921 --> 00:51:07,051
 You really don't know?

581
00:51:09,421 --> 00:51:11,001
 Let go.

582
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:12,698
 I'll carry it for you.

583
00:51:12,698 --> 00:51:16,328
 Hey! Your mom's the one who cheated!

584
00:51:18,831 --> 00:51:22,221
Do you know all the things I did to Yu Jin?

585
00:51:23,221 --> 00:51:26,901
How could you not say a word to me!

586
00:51:38,921 --> 00:51:43,661
Do you really not know why I didn't?

587
00:51:43,661 --> 00:51:45,301
It was all for you.

588
00:51:45,301 --> 00:51:48,681
I was trying to protect you, my precious daughter!

589
00:51:48,681 --> 00:51:52,141
What kind of mom wants to see her child hurt?

590
00:51:54,571 --> 00:51:57,551
It's always everyone else's fault for you, isn't it?

591
00:51:57,551 --> 00:51:59,171
Now...

592
00:52:05,071 --> 00:52:06,701
That's enough.

593
00:52:09,821 --> 00:52:13,891
You knew Yu Jin stayed at her birth mother's store after high school, right?

594
00:52:15,531 --> 00:52:17,591
What happened then?

595
00:52:19,321 --> 00:52:21,021
Answer me.

596
00:52:21,021 --> 00:52:24,251
I'm asking you, what else happened?

597
00:52:24,251 --> 00:52:27,951
Are you threatening your mom right now?

598
00:52:27,951 --> 00:52:31,131
How could you do this to me!

599
00:52:31,131 --> 00:52:34,101
You know how I raised you!

600
00:52:34,101 --> 00:52:36,771
Mom! Mom! Mom!

601
00:52:36,771 --> 00:52:39,671
Please help! Mom!

602
00:52:55,251 --> 00:52:57,271
Do you know what this is?

603
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:08,761
But then again, you'd pretend not to know even if you did.

604
00:53:10,901 --> 00:53:15,031
Even if you don't tell me, I'll find out what this is.

605
00:53:15,031 --> 00:53:17,711
And I'll find out what happened to Yu Jin.

606
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:36,311
 When was she here?

607
00:53:36,311 --> 00:53:38,421
 Maybe it's been about two months?

608
00:53:38,421 --> 00:53:40,341
 You sent it on December 4th, right?

609
00:53:40,341 --> 00:53:42,981
 Yu Jin came and left it with me before.

610
00:53:42,981 --> 00:53:45,591
 I don't know what the key is for.

611
00:54:02,451 --> 00:54:06,851
 Keys and Hardware

612
00:54:09,251 --> 00:54:11,201
Hello.

613
00:54:15,571 --> 00:54:17,771
Sir. Hello.

614
00:54:17,771 --> 00:54:20,981
By any chance, do you know what kind of key this might be?

615
00:54:27,271 --> 00:54:32,331
Isn't this a key to an apartment storage locker?

616
00:54:32,331 --> 00:54:37,371
- Really?
 - Yes. I remember because I went to unlock one before.

617
00:54:37,371 --> 00:54:40,451
But I think the number tag that should be here fell off.

618
00:54:40,451 --> 00:54:43,401
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

619
00:54:54,721 --> 00:54:57,821
 Building 151. Unit 1004. `

620
00:55:01,691 --> 00:55:04,881
 Where is it? Building 151. Unit 1004.

621
00:56:28,391 --> 00:56:33,711
 Kang Do Joon, please come in for the suspect investigation for the death of Oh Yu Jin.

622
00:56:40,451 --> 00:56:42,371
 Sim Hye Jeong

623
00:56:42,371 --> 00:56:44,611
Damn.

624
00:56:46,811 --> 00:56:49,261
- What is it now?
  - What is that key for?

625
00:56:49,261 --> 00:56:51,671
 What is it that Jang Mi Ho is going to such lengths?

626
00:56:51,671 --> 00:56:56,211
Mind your own business. It has nothing to do with you.

627
00:56:56,211 --> 00:56:58,281
I shouldn't have returned it to her.

628
00:56:58,281 --> 00:57:00,211
I should've found out what it was.

629
00:57:00,211 --> 00:57:05,001
I wonder if I shut my mouth for too low a price.

630
00:57:05,001 --> 00:57:08,541
- Look!
 - The person who left the package outside Yu Jin's house.

631
00:57:08,541 --> 00:57:10,431
Who is it?

632
00:57:10,431 --> 00:57:13,911
 Who was there that day?

633
00:57:16,201 --> 00:57:17,841
By chance...

634
00:57:17,841 --> 00:57:20,021
- was it your—
- Shut your mouth!

635
00:57:20,021 --> 00:57:23,201
I wouldn't talk! You sold off your daughter's life!

636
00:57:23,201 --> 00:57:28,401
If you call me one more time about this, I might just kill you, and no one would know!

637
00:58:07,171 --> 00:58:11,111
 Do you know how messy things got because you left the package there?

638
00:58:14,331 --> 00:58:16,351
 Look who's talking. You should've kept your promise in the first place.

639
00:58:16,351 --> 00:58:19,381
 I didn't keep quiet to see this mess, either.

640
00:58:19,381 --> 00:58:20,731
 This isn't how you repay your debt...

641
00:58:20,731 --> 00:58:22,821
Shit.

642
00:58:25,931 --> 00:58:29,671
 What are you talking about? You're the one who owes me!

643
00:58:38,811 --> 00:58:43,151
 But you killed Yu Jin

644
00:59:05,601 --> 00:59:07,381
 ooo_yoojin just uploaded a picture

 It's a date night for us tonight.

646

 Kids are away at an overnight camp, and we plan for a cozy night together.

♫  Something's wrong, wake me up from my blindfolded eyes  ♫

649

 Battle For Happiness

657
01:00:22,191 --> 01:00:25,601
 We didn't find any diagnoses or conditions of that sort.

658
01:00:25,601 --> 01:00:27,411
 It seems like you may have a motive.

659
01:00:27,411 --> 01:00:32,011
 Do you think that she'd admit to having a mental illness?

660
01:00:32,011 --> 01:00:34,031
 Has it been decided not to hand it over to the prosecution?

661
01:00:34,031 --> 01:00:36,901
 Unless new evidence comes up, it would be difficult.

662
01:00:36,901 --> 01:00:39,631
 Who would steal someone's package at that time?

663
01:00:39,631 --> 01:00:42,301
 Do you think that's a coincidence?

664
01:00:42,301 --> 01:00:45,131
 It could have been a witness or an accomplice.

665
01:00:45,131 --> 01:00:47,921
 Why? Are you going to confess?

666
01:00:47,921 --> 01:00:49,981
 Another suspect's confession. Not mine.

667
01:00:49,981 --> 01:00:52,871
 Ms. Hwang, you have two cell phones?

668
01:00:54,831 --> 01:00:56,401
 Ms. Hwang! Ms. Hwang!

669
01:00:56,401 --> 01:01:00,711
 What do you mean, Su Bin and Oh Yu Jin met often?

670
01:01:00,711 --> 01:01:05,981
 By chance, is Jeong Su Bin connected to that woman's death?

671
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:12,801
 Do you even know why Yu Jin died?

672
01:01:12,801 --> 01:01:18,421
 Without me, you won't be able to find out anything.

673
01:01:18,421 --> 01:01:20,931
 Should I tell you the truth?

674
01:01:23,161 --> 01:01:25,551
 Will you be able to handle it?

675
01:01:26,781 --> 01:01:30,671
