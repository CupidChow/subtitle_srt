11
00:00:48,544 --> 00:00:51,214

I don't know how she provoked Yu Jin, but Yu Jin got extremely agitated.

12
00:00:51,214 --> 00:00:53,954
 Detective, can you accept everything Kang Do Joon said?

13
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:56,734
 If two people were in a space and one of them died,

14
00:00:56,734 --> 00:00:59,044
 shouldn't you be most suspicious of the other person?

15
00:00:59,044 --> 00:01:02,034
 You know better than anyone who this person is.

16
00:01:02,034 --> 00:01:03,914
 What's going on? You said everything will be fine.

17
00:01:03,914 --> 00:01:05,834
 Sounds like she knows you're behind it.

18
00:01:05,834 --> 00:01:08,434
 Once is enough. I won't do any more dangerous stunts.

19
00:01:08,434 --> 00:01:12,114
 She attacked my husband and Jeong Ah's company on social media.

20
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:13,634
 Just stay put.

21
00:01:13,634 --> 00:01:17,334
 I'll find out that bitch's weakness, no matter what.

22
00:01:17,334 --> 00:01:21,004
 Yu Jin acted very strangely for a while, right before she died.

23
00:01:21,004 --> 00:01:23,114
 I heard she even caused a scene at the kindergarten.

24
00:01:23,114 --> 00:01:24,784
 I think she ripped up the children's drawings or something.

25
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:27,304
 That anonymous bulletin board is not just any bulletin board.

26
00:01:27,304 --> 00:01:29,754
 If Yu Jin had a huge, unspeakable secret,

27
00:01:29,754 --> 00:01:32,464
 she would have shared it there, not with us.

28
00:01:32,464 --> 00:01:34,224
 You have a baby face.

31
00:01:42,814 --> 00:01:47,084
 This video was shocking, even for me, but I think my child saw it.

32
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:57,990

33
00:02:05,854 --> 00:02:08,614

34
00:02:10,534 --> 00:02:15,344
 "If I find a strange video on my husband's laptop."

35
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:17,804
 "I am trying even now to stay calm.

36
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:21,764
 yet, my hands can't help but tremble."

37
00:02:24,904 --> 00:02:32,334
 "In the video, my husband was engaging in some kind of weird play."

38
00:02:32,334 --> 00:02:33,954
You have a baby face.

39
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:36,084
I hear that often.

40
00:02:38,374 --> 00:02:40,224
Hey! Did you come prepared?

41
00:02:40,224 --> 00:02:42,124
 In the video, my husband had 'sex' with that person... I am so 'disgusted' by him.

42
00:02:42,124 --> 00:02:44,394
 I didn't know my husband had such a fetish. This video was shocking even for me.

43
00:02:53,934 --> 00:02:55,434
Get ready.

44
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,084
 I think my child...

45
00:02:59,024 --> 00:03:02,124
 It's a video that was shocking, even for me, but I think my child saw it./

Just a moment!

55
00:04:09,954 --> 00:04:12,574
I called you several times.

56
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:16,714
Is this you, by chance?

57
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,134
Yes.

58
00:04:22,014 --> 00:04:23,764
This is something very urgent.

59
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,514
How long do you think it will take?

60
00:04:26,514 --> 00:04:28,394
I'll have to try it to know.

61
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:30,244
Can you get it done by tomorrow?

62
00:04:30,244 --> 00:04:31,714
I'll pay you however much you want.

63
00:04:31,714 --> 00:04:34,404
I get it, so please leave now.

64
00:04:34,404 --> 00:04:36,894
Please take care of it as soon as possible.

65
00:04:56,034 --> 00:04:59,184
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail...

68
00:05:27,874 --> 00:05:29,924
Could you take a seat for a minute?

69
00:05:38,134 --> 00:05:41,574
I need to ask you for a favor.

70
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:44,314
You know Jeong Sik's car accident.

71
00:05:44,314 --> 00:05:47,844
Could you testify you were the one driving?

72
00:05:47,844 --> 00:05:50,874
Didn't you report the car as stolen?

73
00:05:50,874 --> 00:05:54,344
I canceled it because it felt like I was making things worse.

74
00:05:55,414 --> 00:05:58,184
I promise you nothing will happen.

75
00:05:58,184 --> 00:05:59,914
It's not like anyone got hurt

76
00:05:59,914 --> 00:06:03,064
and what trouble will come of us damaging our own car?

77
00:06:03,064 --> 00:06:07,484
I can just shut up Jeong Sik's friends with bribes as we've done before.

78
00:06:09,704 --> 00:06:12,664
But you know how he has a past record.

79
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,740
Please do me this favor.

80
00:06:20,454 --> 00:06:22,204
Great work.

81
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,314
Yeah, there's no trouble, right?

82
00:06:28,314 --> 00:06:29,454
What about Jeong Sik?

83
00:06:29,454 --> 00:06:32,084
Yeah, he's doing fine.

84
00:06:32,084 --> 00:06:37,314
But Honey, you know I have to go to a meeting in Hannam-dong, right?

85
00:06:38,244 --> 00:06:41,024
Yeah, okay.

86
00:06:43,204 --> 00:06:45,014
What kind of meeting is it?

87
00:06:45,014 --> 00:06:47,354
A meeting of Herinity dads.

88
00:06:48,334 --> 00:06:49,874
The one at the membership club?

89
00:06:49,874 --> 00:06:52,114
What? Yeah.

90
00:06:52,114 --> 00:06:54,884
I'll be back soon. Order some food for yourself.

91
00:06:54,884 --> 00:06:57,084
Oh, wait a minute...

92
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,644
Brother-in-law, can I come with you?

93
00:06:59,644 --> 00:07:01,824
Why are you being like this? What if your noona finds out?

94
00:07:01,824 --> 00:07:04,244
How would she know if we're out briefly?

95
00:07:04,244 --> 00:07:06,084
No, you can't. You really can't.

96
00:07:06,084 --> 00:07:08,034
Hey, Jeong Su Bin.

97
00:07:08,624 --> 00:07:11,034
How can you do this to me?

98
00:07:11,034 --> 00:07:13,354
Did you already forget what I did for you?

99
00:07:24,604 --> 00:07:26,964
If I say I'm going, I'm going.

100
00:07:26,964 --> 00:07:29,114
Who are you to interfere?

101
00:07:29,884 --> 00:07:32,794
You know what will happen if I open my mouth.

102
00:07:32,794 --> 00:07:35,174
You birdbrain.

103
00:07:36,064 --> 00:07:38,004
Remember that.

104
00:07:38,004 --> 00:07:40,094
Remember.

105
00:07:50,444 --> 00:07:52,494
I'll see you at the next meeting.

106
00:07:58,414 --> 00:08:01,284
Why is she not answering me? 
  What do they say at the hospital?

107
00:08:01,284 --> 00:08:03,144
 Is my pretty one busy?

108
00:08:03,144 --> 00:08:05,294
 I'm going home.

114
00:08:26,094 --> 00:08:28,584
Oh, my daughter!

115
00:08:29,524 --> 00:08:30,784
Did you have fun today?

116
00:08:30,784 --> 00:08:33,254
- Yeah.
 - You're home early today.

117
00:08:36,254 --> 00:08:37,754
Oh, my.

118
00:08:39,774 --> 00:08:41,654
Honey, you're home.

119
00:08:45,384 --> 00:08:47,914
What is this? What happened?

120
00:08:47,914 --> 00:08:50,014
Oh, didn't I tell you?

121
00:08:50,014 --> 00:08:53,924
I heard Ms. Jo quit the kindergarten and was taking a break.

122
00:08:53,924 --> 00:08:56,224
Why? Is there a problem?

123
00:08:56,224 --> 00:08:58,964
No, I was just surprised.

124
00:09:00,304 --> 00:09:03,344
We'll have dinner with Ms. Jo tonight.

125
00:09:03,344 --> 00:09:06,434
It's a good thing you didn't go to the gathering tonight. Right?

126
00:09:07,394 --> 00:09:08,694
Yeah.

127
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:18,644
 Tell me what kind of person Kang Do Joon is.

128
00:09:18,644 --> 00:09:20,094
 You must know him very well.

129
00:09:20,094 --> 00:09:23,054
 I don't want to get involved in those matters.

130
00:09:25,134 --> 00:09:28,494
 Lee Tae Ho

131
00:09:28,494 --> 00:09:29,844
Here.

132
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,444
What are you doing? Aren't you going to get changed?

133
00:09:33,444 --> 00:09:37,534
Aigoo, I knew I was forgetting something.

134
00:09:37,534 --> 00:09:40,744
I was supposed to go to the meeting. I actually just stopped by the house to change my clothes.

135
00:09:40,744 --> 00:09:42,634
What are you talking about?

136
00:09:42,634 --> 00:09:47,434
I just talked to Seong Hui on the phone, and her husband thinks you're not coming.

137
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,554
 Jang Mi Ho

138
00:09:55,454 --> 00:09:57,204
Hello, Jang Mi Ho.

139
00:09:57,204 --> 00:09:59,814
If you have time, could I meet you sometime?

140
00:09:59,814 --> 00:10:00,834
 I know a request like this is—

141
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:03,534
Of course. Could you come to where I am?

142
00:10:03,534 --> 00:10:05,834
I will send you the address by text.

143
00:10:07,254 --> 00:10:10,664
 Hannam-dong 9-3.

144
00:10:12,554 --> 00:10:14,234
I forgot to tell you this.

145
00:10:14,234 --> 00:10:18,494
- I'm supposed to introduce Jang Mi Ho to our meeting members. 
 - Why?

146
00:10:18,494 --> 00:10:21,894
I guess she has something to ask about Kang Do Joon.

147
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,674
Yes, this is Kang Do—

148
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:47,214
- I'm the one on the phone. 
- Where are you?

149
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:49,054
Did you get discharged from the hospital?

150
00:11:03,334 --> 00:11:06,144
I had something to take care of, so I stopped by a hotel. Why are you calling?

151
00:11:06,144 --> 00:11:08,244
 You know we have a meeting today, right?

152
00:11:10,124 --> 00:11:11,404
Right now, I'm a bit—

153
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,474
Jang Mi Ho will come.

154
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,554
 Lee Tae Ho

155
00:12:00,394 --> 00:12:01,844
Let's go.

156
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:22,604
What is this place?

157
00:12:22,604 --> 00:12:24,944
You said you had something important to ask me.

158
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,854
It's a place that's fitting for that.

159
00:12:37,984 --> 00:12:40,684
I asked what this place is for!

160
00:12:45,284 --> 00:12:48,774
You said you were curious about what Kang Do Joon did.

161
00:12:48,774 --> 00:12:53,034
Don't you want to find out what he did inside there?

162
00:12:53,034 --> 00:12:57,134
I thought it would be better to see for yourself than hear it from me.

163
00:13:08,384 --> 00:13:09,704
All right.

164
00:13:34,204 --> 00:13:36,904
What were you imagining that your facial expression is like that?

165
00:13:36,904 --> 00:13:39,634
You've got quite a twisted mind.

166
00:13:39,634 --> 00:13:42,044
I told you guys. This is Jang Mi Ho.

167
00:13:42,044 --> 00:13:43,774
She has a lot of questions.

168
00:13:43,774 --> 00:13:45,784
Welcome. My name is Yoon Seong Jae.

169
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:48,274
- I'm Kim Wu Hyeok.
- Please take a seat.

170
00:13:56,884 --> 00:13:58,694
I'm Jeong Su Bin.

171
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:09,804
I'm sorry. This is the first time we've had a female guest here.

172
00:14:10,714 --> 00:14:12,454
Gosh, Chae Ah's father.

173
00:14:12,454 --> 00:14:14,564
Come on, Eun Han's father.

174
00:14:14,564 --> 00:14:16,894
Mentioning children's names here is cheating!

175
00:14:16,894 --> 00:14:20,424
So, what were you curious about?

176
00:14:30,334 --> 00:14:32,724
Why don't you give me a drink first?

177
00:16:10,814 --> 00:16:13,094
 Bannae-dong couple murder case... possibility of a planned murder

178
00:16:17,104 --> 00:16:18,614
 Though ten days have passed... the Bannae-done couple murder is still a mystery

179
00:16:18,614 --> 00:16:20,514
 "Was it the act of an acquaintance?" No sign of a break-in for the Bannae-dong couple murder

180
00:16:54,894 --> 00:16:57,364
One martini. Ah, actually,

181
00:16:57,364 --> 00:16:59,884
give me whiskey, the most expensive one you've got.

182
00:17:30,994 --> 00:17:32,514
It was unfortunate for him.

183
00:17:32,514 --> 00:17:34,964
He didn't deserve that.

184
00:17:34,964 --> 00:17:39,184
He was a right and proper man.

185
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:42,204
And he's rich. He's the director of his own clinic.

186
00:17:42,204 --> 00:17:44,814
He didn't seem to be cheating.

187
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,084
Was I the only one to think so?

188
00:17:48,054 --> 00:17:50,384
His love for his wife was very strong.

189
00:17:50,384 --> 00:17:53,084
I'm pretty sure he even handed over ownership of the house to Oh Yu Jin.

190
00:17:53,084 --> 00:17:55,874
Kang Do Joon did that?

191
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:58,234
I introduced him to a judicial scrivener.* 
 *(legal real estate procedures professional)

192
00:17:58,234 --> 00:18:01,344
He was advised to pursue a co-ownership of the house for tax purposes,

193
00:18:01,344 --> 00:18:03,674
but he insisted on letting his wife own it.

194
00:18:03,674 --> 00:18:05,184
Why is that?

195
00:18:07,764 --> 00:18:11,134
We're not close enough to divulge things like that.

196
00:18:12,364 --> 00:18:14,724
Maybe she found his weakness.

197
00:18:14,724 --> 00:18:17,774
What could he possibly have done wrong to hand over a house worth billions of won?

198
00:18:17,774 --> 00:18:20,194
How much gift tax did he have to pay?

199
00:18:33,331 --> 00:18:35,211
Why won't you believe me?

200
00:18:35,211 --> 00:18:39,281
I'm telling you I'm the younger brother of the CEO of that company!

201
00:18:39,281 --> 00:18:44,451
Shall I provide all of you with a box of Spirit High?

202
00:18:46,441 --> 00:18:48,741
Hey, it's difficult working here, right?

203
00:18:50,351 --> 00:18:52,251
Give me your number.

204
00:18:52,251 --> 00:18:55,671
- Sir—
 - I'll get you hired in my noona's company.

205
00:18:55,671 --> 00:18:58,271
Do you know how many people I got hired there?

206
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:00,261
I'm serious. Give me your number.

207
00:19:00,261 --> 00:19:03,361
I'm doing this because I feel sorry for you!

208
00:19:03,361 --> 00:19:06,361
I heard you went out on the field with Mr. Lim last time.

209
00:19:06,361 --> 00:19:08,651
Did you improve at all from the lessons?

210
00:19:08,651 --> 00:19:10,591
I just relaxed and played.

211
00:19:10,591 --> 00:19:12,261
I'll be going now.

212
00:19:12,261 --> 00:19:13,271
Will you?

213
00:19:13,271 --> 00:19:16,201
Aigoo, you're going to leave already?

214
00:19:16,201 --> 00:19:18,341
Today was a pleasure.

215
00:19:18,341 --> 00:19:20,031
Let's meet again next time.

216
00:19:22,801 --> 00:19:24,211
I'll grab you a taxi.

217
00:19:24,211 --> 00:19:25,311
It's fine.

218
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,881
Let's go.

219
00:19:38,781 --> 00:19:40,731
She's not my type.

220
00:19:40,731 --> 00:19:43,941
Gosh, you never know how she might be.

221
00:19:45,011 --> 00:19:48,551
But why is she so dumb?

222
00:19:48,551 --> 00:19:51,231
Would we say anything if she's like that?

223
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:54,351
Why not? I almost made a mistake while drinking.

224
00:19:54,351 --> 00:19:56,911
Gosh, what is there to make a mistake about?

225
00:19:56,911 --> 00:19:59,851
You know, Kang Do Joon's tastes.

226
00:19:59,851 --> 00:20:03,041
He even went to the nightclub before with Director Park.

227
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:06,151
Don't you think he handed over the deed to the house because she found out about that?

228
00:20:15,401 --> 00:20:17,911
Have a good time by yourselves.

229
00:20:22,051 --> 00:20:24,821
What the? Maybe she heard us.

230
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:30,421
 Recording in progress

231
00:20:34,171 --> 00:20:35,621
Let's go.

232
00:20:37,521 --> 00:20:39,131
Thank you, but I'm fine.

233
00:20:39,131 --> 00:20:42,201
I said, give me your number!

234
00:20:45,201 --> 00:20:46,701
Hey!

235
00:20:52,831 --> 00:20:54,631
What are you doing?

236
00:20:57,011 --> 00:20:58,911
Did you call for a female escort?

237
00:20:58,911 --> 00:21:02,691
- It's not like that. 
- I knew it when you said you were coming here.

238
00:21:02,691 --> 00:21:04,771
What would have happened if I hadn't come here?

239
00:21:04,771 --> 00:21:07,021
- It's not like that.
 - Excuse me.

240
00:21:07,021 --> 00:21:09,661
Who are you that you're being so rude?

241
00:21:10,981 --> 00:21:12,851
Hey, you bastard.

242
00:21:12,851 --> 00:21:15,921
How could you do this to my noona!

243
00:21:15,921 --> 00:21:18,421
You bastard, leeching money off of my noona!

244
00:21:18,421 --> 00:21:22,161
How dare you meet another girl!

245
00:21:22,161 --> 00:21:24,621
You can't do this here. Please go outside and talk.

246
00:21:24,621 --> 00:21:25,851
Let go.

247
00:21:26,691 --> 00:21:28,781
I told you to let go!

248
00:21:30,231 --> 00:21:33,621
You should know your place as one leeching off of a woman.

249
00:21:33,621 --> 00:21:38,481
Hey. I will take responsibility and make sure you get divorced from my noona.

250
00:21:38,481 --> 00:21:41,931
Please just stop!

251
00:21:41,931 --> 00:21:43,241
You bastard!

252
00:21:43,241 --> 00:21:45,201
Please stop this!

253
00:21:45,201 --> 00:21:46,851
Let go!

254
00:21:51,821 --> 00:21:53,701
Mr. Han, where are you?

255
00:21:53,701 --> 00:21:56,031
Why don't you get it?

256
00:21:56,031 --> 00:21:58,401
I'm telling you to come right now!

257
00:22:39,981 --> 00:22:43,441
I have no words. I'm so sorry.

258
00:22:43,441 --> 00:22:45,001
Why would you be sorry?

259
00:22:45,001 --> 00:22:46,501
He's the one who hit me.

260
00:22:46,501 --> 00:22:49,241
Could you please not report this to the police?

261
00:22:49,241 --> 00:22:53,931
I'll pay you sufficient compensation.

262
00:23:27,801 --> 00:23:29,851
Go wait in the car.

263
00:23:34,901 --> 00:23:38,001
- Bring me three thousand by tomorrow.
 - Understood.

264
00:23:47,521 --> 00:23:49,771
Damn her!

265
00:23:49,771 --> 00:23:52,421
The safe is in the basement of her house.

266
00:24:03,981 --> 00:24:06,801
She's no ordinary person.

267
00:24:20,851 --> 00:24:24,311
But what's there for you to worry about?

268
00:24:24,311 --> 00:24:27,681
Who doesn't have a secret like that?

269
00:24:29,244 --> 00:24:31,754
The problem is giving her something to be suspicious about.

270
00:24:31,754 --> 00:24:34,524
 You already settled it with Oh Yu Jin by handing over the apartment.

271
00:24:34,524 --> 00:24:37,884
 You already told the police everything. Why worry?

272
00:24:37,884 --> 00:24:40,654
You going to the club has nothing to do with Oh Yu Jin's death.

273
00:24:40,654 --> 00:24:44,514
I don't like that woman Jang Mi Ho digging around!

274
00:24:45,454 --> 00:24:48,444
Is there anything for her to find by digging around?

275
00:24:51,594 --> 00:24:54,614
 Is there something you haven't told me?

276
00:24:56,184 --> 00:24:58,704
I told you all you need to know.

277
00:24:58,704 --> 00:25:01,384
 Well, you do what you need to do.

278
00:25:01,384 --> 00:25:03,194
 Tell me what you need to tell me,

279
00:25:03,194 --> 00:25:07,004
 so you can hide what you need to hide. That's another way.

280
00:25:07,004 --> 00:25:08,714
You shouldn't assume.

281
00:25:08,714 --> 00:25:11,204
What do you think I'm hiding?

282
00:25:12,994 --> 00:25:16,054
Anyway, seeing how Jang Mi Ho is sticking around like this,

283
00:25:16,054 --> 00:25:17,944
it looks like it'll become a headache.

284
00:25:17,944 --> 00:25:21,284
Don't worry about it. I'll handle it by myself.

285
00:25:28,604 --> 00:25:31,604
 You know, Kang Do Joon's tastes.

286
00:25:31,604 --> 00:25:35,494
 He even went to the nightclub before with Director Park.

287
00:25:35,494 --> 00:25:38,524
 Don't you think he handed over the deed to the house because she found out about that?

288
00:25:43,414 --> 00:25:47,274
 If I find a strange video on my husband's laptop.

289
00:25:54,204 --> 00:25:58,064
 I unlocked the password. Come and pick it up.

290
00:26:04,944 --> 00:26:06,664
Hello.

291
00:26:16,344 --> 00:26:19,294
Thank you, thank you!

292
00:26:43,514 --> 00:26:44,314
 Pandora's Box

293
00:26:45,974 --> 00:26:46,844
 Kang Do Joon

294
00:27:05,504 --> 00:27:06,934
 Come here.

295
00:27:07,874 --> 00:27:09,844
 I said, come here right now!

296
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:44,584
 I think my child...

297
00:27:44,584 --> 00:27:46,354
 Sparkly jewel?

298
00:27:46,354 --> 00:27:50,344
 Stupid, it wasn't a sparkly jewel. It was a USB.

299
00:27:50,344 --> 00:27:53,944
 Ji Yool, do you know what a USB is?

300
00:27:53,944 --> 00:27:57,334
 Yes. The one in the office. Mom's.

301
00:28:03,024 --> 00:28:07,154
Gosh, Ji Yool watched this?

302
00:28:20,894 --> 00:28:25,344
 Kang Do Joon

303
00:28:30,274 --> 00:28:31,884
Where are you?

304
00:28:31,884 --> 00:28:33,684
Let's meet.

305
00:28:34,684 --> 00:28:36,304
 All right.

306
00:29:20,264 --> 00:29:22,394
Was it because of this?

307
00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:25,524
The reason you and Yu Jin fought that day?

308
00:29:27,644 --> 00:29:29,614
I saw the video.

309
00:29:31,174 --> 00:29:34,984
Did that happen because Yu Jin found out about it?

310
00:29:38,704 --> 00:29:42,664
Do you know Ji Yool watched the video?

311
00:29:42,664 --> 00:29:44,244
How could you—

312
00:29:49,574 --> 00:29:52,254
I'm going to the police with this,

313
00:29:52,254 --> 00:29:54,414
so you should turn yourself in first

314
00:29:54,414 --> 00:29:57,274
if you really care about Ji Yool and Ha Yool.

315
00:30:05,344 --> 00:30:07,104
Go ahead.

316
00:30:08,034 --> 00:30:09,754
What did you say?

317
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:13,824
I said you should go to the police.

318
00:30:13,824 --> 00:30:15,944
But the police already know about it.

319
00:30:15,944 --> 00:30:17,824
Yu Jin knew about it, too.

320
00:30:17,824 --> 00:30:19,174
In fact, she knew for a long time.

321
00:30:19,174 --> 00:30:21,924
So you're admitting you killed Yu Jin because of the video—

322
00:30:21,924 --> 00:30:23,604
Geez...

323
00:30:24,574 --> 00:30:26,764
This is so bothersome.

324
00:30:30,314 --> 00:30:35,384
Yu Jin and I came to a settlement to bury it.

325
00:30:35,384 --> 00:30:38,634
That's why I gave her the ownership of our house and finances.

326
00:30:38,634 --> 00:30:42,854
So why would I kill Yu Jin over something that's already in the past?

327
00:30:42,854 --> 00:30:44,254
We settled this already.

328
00:30:44,254 --> 00:30:46,534
And they all got paid for the job they did.

329
00:30:46,534 --> 00:30:50,354
It had nothing to do with Yu Jin's death.

330
00:30:56,924 --> 00:30:58,784
So...

331
00:30:59,734 --> 00:31:02,504
please stop bothering me.

332
00:31:20,354 --> 00:31:22,164
What exactly happened that day?

333
00:31:22,164 --> 00:31:24,064
What happened that it led to a stabbing?

334
00:31:24,064 --> 00:31:25,784
Why are you asking me that?

335
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:27,914
It's something you and Yu Jin plotted together!

336
00:31:27,914 --> 00:31:29,374
Stop talking nonsense!

337
00:31:29,374 --> 00:31:31,464
You know what you're saying makes no sense!

338
00:31:31,464 --> 00:31:32,854
Damn it!

339
00:31:33,714 --> 00:31:35,464
Why do you keep avoiding it

340
00:31:35,464 --> 00:31:38,114
when Yu Jin really died because of you?

341
00:31:38,114 --> 00:31:41,124
After you appeared, Yu Jin seemed like a crazy person.

342
00:31:41,124 --> 00:31:43,824
Do you know how many times she woke up screaming in the middle of the night?

343
00:31:43,824 --> 00:31:47,204
She was trembling, fearing her past might be exposed!

344
00:31:49,604 --> 00:31:52,354
Okay, we did fight that day.

345
00:31:52,354 --> 00:31:55,264
She had another hysterical fit while talking about you,

346
00:31:55,264 --> 00:31:57,394
and I thought I'd go crazy myself!

347
00:31:57,394 --> 00:31:59,064
But,

348
00:31:59,064 --> 00:32:04,164
the one who lost it and stabbed herself was Yu Jin!

349
00:32:04,164 --> 00:32:06,654
I wanted you to suffer as well, so I told the police—

350
00:32:06,654 --> 00:32:09,164
Sure! I lied a little bit.

351
00:32:09,164 --> 00:32:15,144
But, do you know what Yu Jin's last words were when she called you?

352
00:32:21,404 --> 00:32:22,744
 ...help...

353
00:32:22,744 --> 00:32:24,504
"Please die."

354
00:32:27,014 --> 00:32:29,734
"You disgust me."

355
00:32:29,734 --> 00:32:33,304
"Because of you... If only you didn't exist...

356
00:32:33,304 --> 00:32:36,414
I really wish you could just die."

357
00:32:36,414 --> 00:32:38,654
Yu Jin died thinking of you,

358
00:32:38,654 --> 00:32:40,904
and resented you until the very end.

359
00:32:40,904 --> 00:32:45,094
Jang Mi Ho. She died because of you.

360
00:32:45,094 --> 00:32:48,994
Don't you try to avoid that fact.

361
00:33:43,214 --> 00:33:45,134
Welcome.

362
00:34:14,064 --> 00:34:15,804
 Jang Mi Ho

363
00:34:19,844 --> 00:34:22,354
 Letter of Complaint

364
00:34:22,354 --> 00:34:28,454
 Letter of complaint

365
00:34:28,454 --> 00:34:32,564
"I lived together with Jang Mi Ho for six years

366
00:34:32,564 --> 00:34:36,324
as sisters when our parents got remarried."

367
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:40,214
After a series of immoral acts by Jang Mi Ho, we got separated,

368
00:34:40,214 --> 00:34:42,594
and we lived without contacting each other for 18 years."

369
00:34:42,594 --> 00:34:47,194
"However, not too long ago, Jang Mi Ho appeared out of the blue,

370
00:34:47,194 --> 00:34:51,154
and threatened to expose the past."

371
00:34:51,154 --> 00:34:53,864
"She used a commercial deal to lure me out,

372
00:34:53,864 --> 00:34:57,034
and went as far as to put my daughter in danger."

373
00:34:57,034 --> 00:35:00,134
"As a result, I ended up having nervous breakdowns from anxiety and fear,

374
00:35:00,134 --> 00:35:01,874
and couldn't even sleep."

375
00:35:01,874 --> 00:35:04,634
 Do you know how many times she woke up in the middle of the night screaming?

376
00:35:04,634 --> 00:35:07,974
 She was trembling, fearing her past might be exposed!

377
00:35:07,974 --> 00:35:09,814
 Hey, Oh Yu Jin.

378
00:35:09,814 --> 00:35:12,434
 You disgust me.

379
00:35:12,434 --> 00:35:14,274
 If it...

380
00:35:14,274 --> 00:35:16,784
 Only if it wasn't for you...

381
00:35:19,834 --> 00:35:22,454
 I wish you could just die.

382
00:35:25,484 --> 00:35:27,854
 Yu Jin died thinking of you,

383
00:35:27,854 --> 00:35:30,184
 and blamed you to the end.

384
00:35:30,184 --> 00:35:34,814
 Jang Mi Ho. She died because of you.

385
00:35:35,814 --> 00:35:38,614
"Is she trying to destroy our family?

386
00:35:38,614 --> 00:35:43,154
Living every day with extreme fear like this is hell.

387
00:35:43,154 --> 00:35:45,534
"If there was anything I did wrong,

388
00:35:46,534 --> 00:35:51,934
it was only becoming sisters with Jang Mi Ho when I was younger, though I didn't ask for it."

389
00:35:51,934 --> 00:35:55,174
 "I regret those years so much."

390
00:35:56,474 --> 00:35:57,994
"Please,

391
00:35:59,134 --> 00:36:02,754
I hope the bank will take measures

392
00:36:02,754 --> 00:36:06,254
so that woman can't approach me anymore."

393
00:36:06,254 --> 00:36:07,914
"I'm suffering so much."

394
00:36:07,914 --> 00:36:11,034
"Every day is like hell for me."

395
00:36:11,034 --> 00:36:15,384
"I'm so tormented that it would be better to just die."

396
00:36:50,584 --> 00:36:53,804
 2023 Inner Spirit Investment Fundraising Briefing

397
00:36:53,804 --> 00:36:58,794
Now, we will start the Inner Spirit investment fundraising briefing.

398
00:36:58,794 --> 00:37:02,234
- Yeah.
- Hello, I am President Jeong Su Bin of Inner Spirit.

399
00:37:02,234 --> 00:37:04,754
Why didn't you report to me? Did you take care of it?

400
00:37:04,754 --> 00:37:06,844
 I'm going to meet them this afternoon.

401
00:37:06,844 --> 00:37:09,604
What? You still haven't met with them?

402
00:37:09,604 --> 00:37:12,614
You told me to stay at the motel, CEO.

403
00:37:12,614 --> 00:37:14,144
 Oh, right.

404
00:37:14,144 --> 00:37:17,834
Anyway, don't worry about here. Just make sure to watch Jeong Sik well.

405
00:37:17,834 --> 00:37:20,574
And make sure to shut the nightclub manager's mouth.

406
00:37:20,574 --> 00:37:22,364
 That is your job, Secretary Han.

407
00:37:22,364 --> 00:37:24,624
Yes ma'am. I understand—

408
00:37:27,264 --> 00:37:29,044
Damn it.

409
00:37:42,664 --> 00:37:44,794
Damn it.

410
00:38:06,834 --> 00:38:08,484
It's Han Joon Gyeong.

411
00:38:08,484 --> 00:38:11,014
Could we meet a little earlier today?

412
00:38:11,014 --> 00:38:12,234
Yes, at the nightclub.

413
00:38:12,234 --> 00:38:14,644
I've prepared what we promised.

414
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:26,204
We have less than an hour left. I'm so nervous.

415
00:38:26,204 --> 00:38:27,384
Many people will show up, right?

416
00:38:27,384 --> 00:38:29,194
There weren't enough seats last time.

417
00:38:29,194 --> 00:38:31,714
This many chairs should be enough extra seats, right?

418
00:38:37,264 --> 00:38:40,654
President Jeong, shall we do another presentation rehearsal?

419
00:38:40,654 --> 00:38:42,774
Yes, let's do that.

420
00:38:48,624 --> 00:38:51,794
CEO, I think you need to look at this.

421
00:39:05,964 --> 00:39:09,244
 Please love me!

422
00:39:12,344 --> 00:39:14,764
 - What is this?
- Look at this.

423
00:39:14,764 --> 00:39:17,554
 I think that was the CEO's younger brother.

424
00:39:26,034 --> 00:39:27,564
Who sent this?

425
00:39:27,564 --> 00:39:29,854
- Well, it—
 - CEO!

426
00:39:29,854 --> 00:39:31,954
You need to take a look at this, too. 
 Inner Spirit younger brother

427
00:39:31,954 --> 00:39:33,824
 Inner Spirit younger brother

428
00:39:40,434 --> 00:39:42,934
 CEO Gwak Sang Hyeon – HB Food

429
00:39:45,114 --> 00:39:48,194
- Yes, President.
 - Hello?

430
00:39:48,194 --> 00:39:51,024
- No, that's not true.
 - I will check.

431
00:39:51,024 --> 00:39:53,744
Yes, I'll check.

432
00:39:53,744 --> 00:39:55,844
If you could just give us some time...

433
00:39:56,974 --> 00:40:00,604
Set every phone to silent mode, and don't take any calls right now.

434
00:40:00,604 --> 00:40:02,364
Not until we find out what happened.

435
00:40:02,364 --> 00:40:04,194
 Okay, understood.

436
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:16,824
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail...

437
00:40:16,824 --> 00:40:17,774
 Secretary Han Joon Gyeong

438
00:40:24,724 --> 00:40:26,804
Hey! Gosh...

439
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:35,634
Hello?

440
00:40:35,634 --> 00:40:36,834
Where is Han Joon Gyeong?

441
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:38,624
Gosh, I don't know.

442
00:40:38,624 --> 00:40:41,974
How would I know? He probably went to the nightclub.

443
00:40:41,974 --> 00:40:45,454
You crazy bastard, do you know what just happened?

444
00:40:45,454 --> 00:40:49,074
The videos of you doing meth and punching someone were released!

445
00:40:49,074 --> 00:40:53,424
My company is about to go down because of you. How can you say that?

446
00:40:55,184 --> 00:40:56,934
What?

447
00:40:56,934 --> 00:40:58,904
So tell me quickly.

448
00:40:58,904 --> 00:41:01,564
Where is Han Joon Gyeong, that bastard?

449
00:41:03,654 --> 00:41:05,354
I don't know.

450
00:41:05,354 --> 00:41:07,994
I really don't know!

451
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,430
 Resig—

452
00:42:16,084 --> 00:42:19,444
 CEO, thank you for everything over all this time.

453
00:42:19,444 --> 00:42:22,004
 For various reasons, I won't be able to report in.

454
00:42:22,004 --> 00:42:26,864
 I'll put this money here to good use as my severance pay.

455
00:42:33,654 --> 00:42:36,074
Forcefully insist that the videos were manipulated.

456
00:42:36,074 --> 00:42:38,974
And push forward with today's investment fundraising briefing.

457
00:43:15,974 --> 00:43:18,464
You worked hard today. You should go home now.

458
00:43:18,464 --> 00:43:20,344
Okay, thank you.

459
00:43:20,344 --> 00:43:23,324
You should go home now. Great work today.

460
00:43:26,034 --> 00:43:27,674
You should go home now. Great work today.

461
00:43:27,674 --> 00:43:29,614
We'll be on our way then.

462
00:43:34,004 --> 00:43:35,564
Let's go.

463
00:43:38,234 --> 00:43:40,164
I said, let's go.

464
00:43:41,344 --> 00:43:42,694
Honey, what's wrong?

465
00:43:42,694 --> 00:43:44,754
A-Are you okay?

466
00:43:44,754 --> 00:43:47,904
No. I'm not okay.

467
00:43:47,904 --> 00:43:50,044
Everything's ruined, so how could I be?

468
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,844
Not yet. There's still a way out of this.

469
00:43:52,844 --> 00:43:55,714
I can't be ruined.

470
00:43:55,714 --> 00:43:58,404
What do we do about our Min Seong?

471
00:43:58,404 --> 00:44:03,114
Jeong Woon, Jeong Pil, Jeong Sik... and you as well.

472
00:44:03,114 --> 00:44:06,784
Why are you thinking about others at a time like this?

473
00:44:06,784 --> 00:44:11,494
Why do you keep trying to take responsibility for our lives as well?

474
00:44:11,494 --> 00:44:17,294
That's why up to now, you've... you've lived such a hard life.

475
00:44:44,894 --> 00:44:46,504
 Ms. Jang, is everything all right?

476
00:44:46,504 --> 00:44:48,734
 You know you're supposed to come in to work starting tomorrow, right?

477
00:45:27,354 --> 00:45:29,224
 Kang Bong Seok - Yu Jin's father-in-law

478
00:45:36,824 --> 00:45:38,104
Yes, Mr. Kang.

479
00:45:38,104 --> 00:45:40,704
 Are you busy, Jang Mi Ho?

480
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:43,234
No, you can speak.

481
00:45:44,034 --> 00:45:47,004
Could you come for a moment?

482
00:46:08,384 --> 00:46:10,524
Ji Yool, Ha Yool!

483
00:46:10,524 --> 00:46:12,624
Auntie!

484
00:46:14,334 --> 00:46:15,994
Yeah.

485
00:46:19,834 --> 00:46:21,414
Ha Yool.

486
00:46:22,624 --> 00:46:25,054
Ji Yool, why is Ha Yool being like that?

487
00:46:35,804 --> 00:46:37,584
I heard

488
00:46:37,584 --> 00:46:41,984
you got really scared because Grandpa wasn't there when you woke up, right?

489
00:46:45,174 --> 00:46:49,164
Ha Yool, Auntie, Grandpa,

490
00:46:49,164 --> 00:46:52,864
Mommy and Daddy never abandoned you.

491
00:46:52,864 --> 00:46:55,774
We all love you so much, Ha Yool.

492
00:46:59,724 --> 00:47:04,244
Daddy is currently busy with work,

493
00:47:04,244 --> 00:47:06,074
and I'm also...

494
00:47:14,514 --> 00:47:16,124
Sorry.

495
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:20,224
I shouldn't ask you to understand the circumstances of adults.

496
00:47:27,654 --> 00:47:29,804
I'm sorry.

497
00:47:30,804 --> 00:47:33,144
I'm really sorry, Ha Yool.

498
00:47:34,724 --> 00:47:35,994
I'm sorry.

499
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:46,254
The dinosaur is all done. Who wants it?

500
00:47:46,254 --> 00:47:51,234
- Me, me! I want to have it!
 - Ha Yool, Ha Yool does!

501
00:47:51,234 --> 00:47:53,114
It's mine.

502
00:47:54,624 --> 00:47:57,204
Ha Yool, it's so funny.

503
00:48:14,814 --> 00:48:16,254
Have some.

504
00:48:16,254 --> 00:48:17,574
Okay.

505
00:48:24,604 --> 00:48:26,664
The kids must be anxious, too,

506
00:48:26,664 --> 00:48:28,924
since their caretaker keeps changing.

507
00:48:29,924 --> 00:48:31,484
You're right.

508
00:48:32,314 --> 00:48:35,244
Things should get better when their father comes back.

509
00:48:37,674 --> 00:48:38,944
Pardon?

510
00:48:40,034 --> 00:48:43,884
Aren't they like that because their dad isn't here?

511
00:48:43,884 --> 00:48:48,334
Now, all they have left is their dad.

512
00:48:48,334 --> 00:48:51,764
Hey, Ha Yool, it's so funny.

513
00:48:51,764 --> 00:48:53,364
Hey...

514
00:49:01,474 --> 00:49:03,274
I'm going to go now.

515
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:06,924
Now, if Ji Yool or Ha Yool ever want to see Auntie, you can see me.

516
00:49:06,924 --> 00:49:09,054
Can't you sleep over?

517
00:49:10,054 --> 00:49:12,914
Auntie, why are you always busy?

518
00:49:12,914 --> 00:49:16,964
Daddy and Auntie are both always busy.

519
00:49:19,714 --> 00:49:22,404
Do you miss Daddy a lot?

520
00:49:22,404 --> 00:49:23,984
 Yeah.

521
00:49:27,494 --> 00:49:31,134
I'm sorry for so many things, girls.

522
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:33,344
Like what?

523
00:49:33,344 --> 00:49:36,154
Everything. All of it.

524
00:49:37,604 --> 00:49:39,834
I'm very, very sorry.

525
00:49:49,234 --> 00:49:52,024
 Is there anything for her to find by digging around?

526
00:49:52,024 --> 00:49:55,064
 Is there something you haven't told me?

527
00:50:23,404 --> 00:50:24,784
Did you check the money I sent you?

528
00:50:24,784 --> 00:50:26,264
 Aigoo, thank you.

529
00:50:26,264 --> 00:50:29,654
 Whenever and whatever you need me to do, I'll be available.

530
00:50:29,654 --> 00:50:33,384
You probably know this, but you can't mention this at all to Attorney Lee Tae Ho.

531
00:50:33,384 --> 00:50:35,014
 Oh, of course.

532
00:50:35,014 --> 00:50:39,234
Actually, not just Attorney Lee,

533
00:50:40,684 --> 00:50:43,674
but you'll have to take this secret to your grave.

534
00:50:43,674 --> 00:50:46,234
That way, it will be worth the money I spent on you.

535
00:50:46,234 --> 00:50:48,684
 Of course.

536
00:50:48,684 --> 00:50:51,064
 - But about that kid 
- Damn it!

537
00:50:51,064 --> 00:50:53,274
I told you not to talk about her!

538
00:50:54,854 --> 00:50:55,944
You got that?

539
00:50:55,944 --> 00:50:58,104
 Yes. Yes, I understand.

540
00:51:11,214 --> 00:51:13,514
 I'll tell you the passcode,

541
00:51:13,514 --> 00:51:17,114
 so pick up the stuff you left behind.

542
00:51:51,114 --> 00:51:55,074
 The Bannae-dong couple murder case looks to become prolonged

543
00:51:59,384 --> 00:52:01,194
 DGB Financial Group

544
00:52:01,194 --> 00:52:02,494
 Assistant Manager Jang Mi Ho

545
00:52:03,714 --> 00:52:05,454
 We're delegating tasks before you come, Assistant Manager Jang

546
00:52:05,454 --> 00:52:09,404
Deputy General Manager Koh can do the social data tool upgrade.

547
00:52:09,404 --> 00:52:11,774
Like last time, Assistant Manager Jang will be in charge of planning,

548
00:52:11,774 --> 00:52:15,164
holding meetings, and running official social media accounts.

549
00:52:15,164 --> 00:52:18,034
And for the general office affairs,

550
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:19,534
who wants to be in charge?

551
00:52:21,614 --> 00:52:24,954
Then, I guess Assistant Manager Jang will also be responsible for general office affairs.

552
00:52:24,954 --> 00:52:27,404
Pardon? What did you just say?

553
00:52:28,244 --> 00:52:29,724
Aren't you all being a bit too much?

554
00:52:29,724 --> 00:52:32,654
Assistant Manager Jang is returning tomorrow, and you're delegating tasks without her today.

555
00:52:32,654 --> 00:52:34,944
After giving her all the burdensome duties,

556
00:52:34,944 --> 00:52:37,024
you give her general affairs duty, too?

557
00:52:37,024 --> 00:52:39,634
Are you taking her side because you're her subordinate?

558
00:52:39,634 --> 00:52:42,464
You know, it's not like she was resting easy.

559
00:52:42,464 --> 00:52:45,474
Seriously, you should stop picking on Assistant Manager Jang as fellow human beings!

560
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:53,644
W-What is this? Why are you all laughing?

561
00:52:54,514 --> 00:52:57,534
Associate Manager Lee, do you like Assistant Manager Jang that much?

562
00:52:57,534 --> 00:52:59,004
Pardon?

563
00:52:59,894 --> 00:53:02,124
That's not true! What are you talking about?

564
00:53:02,124 --> 00:53:04,874
Gosh, Assistant Manager Jang must be so happy.

565
00:53:04,874 --> 00:53:06,624
She's got someone like this on her side looking out for her.

566
00:53:06,624 --> 00:53:08,494
It's really not like that!

567
00:53:08,494 --> 00:53:10,524
- I'm telling you, it's not! 
- All right.

568
00:53:10,524 --> 00:53:11,964
Let's just say it's not.

569
00:53:11,964 --> 00:53:13,874
It's really not, right?

570
00:53:16,714 --> 00:53:18,644
I'm telling you, it's really not...

571
00:53:18,644 --> 00:53:20,434
 Assistant Manager Jang Mi Ho

572
00:53:20,434 --> 00:53:21,914
 Assistant Manager Jang, is everything all right?

573
00:53:21,914 --> 00:53:23,154
 Why can't I reach you?

574
00:53:23,154 --> 00:53:24,754
 Assistant Manager Jang, why aren't you picking up your phone?

575
00:53:24,754 --> 00:53:26,324
 Nothing's wrong, right?

576
00:53:26,324 --> 00:53:27,524
 I'm worried about you.

577
00:53:27,524 --> 00:53:29,714
 Please reply when you see this.

578
00:53:31,204 --> 00:53:32,394
I'll see you all tomorrow.

579
00:53:32,394 --> 00:53:34,094
Good night.

580
00:53:37,644 --> 00:53:39,104
Aren't you going home?

581
00:53:39,104 --> 00:53:40,974
I should go.

582
00:53:44,384 --> 00:53:46,494
Why's he like that?

583
00:53:46,494 --> 00:53:49,224
He's like a dog who has lost its master.

584
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:09,224
 You have to come to work tomorrow. What are you doing?

585
00:54:14,524 --> 00:54:17,334
Assistant Manager Jang! Why didn't you pick up my calls?

586
00:54:17,334 --> 00:54:20,474
I thought something happened to you!

587
00:54:20,474 --> 00:54:23,374
Sorry. I didn't even know you had called me.

588
00:54:23,374 --> 00:54:25,704
Do you know how worried I was?

589
00:54:25,704 --> 00:54:28,594
Is it that hard for you to check your phone once?

590
00:54:28,594 --> 00:54:30,304
Where are you right now?

591
00:54:31,224 --> 00:54:32,574
I'm at Yu Jin's house.

592
00:54:32,574 --> 00:54:35,734
I came to pick up my things. Yu Jin's father-in-law gave me the passcode to the front door.

593
00:54:35,734 --> 00:54:38,424
Then just wait there. I'm in a taxi right now.

594
00:54:38,424 --> 00:54:40,884
There's no need for that. I'm going to leave now.

595
00:54:40,884 --> 00:54:43,394
 - I'll see you tomorrow. 
- Assistant Manager Jang, I'm already in the taxi—

596
00:54:44,704 --> 00:54:46,264
Gosh...

597
00:55:51,624 --> 00:55:53,324
 Marilyn

598
00:56:00,264 --> 00:56:02,444
Welcome.

599
00:56:13,434 --> 00:56:15,594
How can I help you?

600
00:57:03,074 --> 00:57:05,784
 Oh Yu Jin

601
00:57:05,784 --> 00:57:07,034
 Sim Hye Jeong

602
00:57:07,034 --> 00:57:08,724
Oh Yu Jin?

603
00:57:16,114 --> 00:57:19,514
I don't know her. How could I remember every single person?

604
00:57:19,514 --> 00:57:22,704
Countless girls work for a little bit and quit.

605
00:57:24,844 --> 00:57:26,804
You came here for nothing.

606
00:57:26,804 --> 00:57:29,494
I'll send a girl. Have a drink before you go.

607
00:57:29,494 --> 00:57:31,174
Mother.

608
00:57:35,474 --> 00:57:37,234
You should take a seat.

609
00:57:40,994 --> 00:57:42,654
 Sim Hye Jeong

610
00:57:43,764 --> 00:57:46,504
 Oh Yu Jin

611
00:57:55,714 --> 00:57:58,234
 It's the price for your life.

612
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:06,570

 Battle For Happiness

 I'm scared that I may learn something I don't want to know.

623
00:58:58,464 --> 00:59:01,524
 Still, I should know what I need to know.

624

 Shim Hye Jeong?

625
00:59:03,274 --> 00:59:05,614
 I wanted to know what you meant by your note.

626
00:59:05,614 --> 00:59:07,844
 I don't know why the package you sent a while ago arrived only now,

627
00:59:07,844 --> 00:59:09,534
 but so many things are bothering me.

628
00:59:09,534 --> 00:59:11,934
 Why should I tell you about that?

629
00:59:12,934 --> 00:59:15,674
 She met the one who caused the problem, Jang Mi Ho.

630
00:59:15,674 --> 00:59:16,894
 So what do you think?

631
00:59:16,894 --> 00:59:18,384
 It's not bad.

632
00:59:18,384 --> 00:59:21,334
 How could you suddenly withdraw your investment funds like that?

633
00:59:21,334 --> 00:59:23,614
 Could you just trust in me—

634
00:59:23,614 --> 00:59:27,154
 Shut up before I rip your mouth apart.

635
00:59:27,154 --> 00:59:29,424
 Mom, Mom!

636
00:59:30,524 --> 00:59:34,724
 I don't know why, but I keep having indigestion.

637
00:59:34,724 --> 00:59:38,274
 Sir, do you know what this key is for?

638
00:59:38,274 --> 00:59:43,234
 Isn't this a key for the lockers in the apartment storage out front?

639
00:59:43,234 --> 00:59:44,314
 Really?

640
00:59:44,314 --> 00:59:46,124
 She brought a key.

641
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:48,884
 - How does she have that key?
 - Damn it!

642
00:59:48,884 --> 00:59:52,164
 There must be something you haven't told me.
