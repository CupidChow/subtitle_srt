 Battle For Happiness

10
00:00:45,077 --> 00:00:48,467
 This is a work of fiction. Characters, locales, agencies, incidents, organizations, and jobs have no connections to real life.

11
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:51,647

It's an annual event. Why are there so many applicants this year?

12
00:00:51,647 --> 00:00:54,337
 Because the prizes are great.

13
00:00:54,337 --> 00:00:55,737
 What? Do you know her?

14
00:00:55,737 --> 00:00:59,527
 Ji Yool and Ha Yool. Happiness is all about sharing.

15
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:01,567
 How can you live so carefree?

16
00:01:01,567 --> 00:01:04,497
 We'll be performing the "Red Shoes" musical in English.

17
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:08,147
 We'll pick the main role through a simple audition.

18
00:01:08,977 --> 00:01:11,877
 - Congratulations!
- Congratulations, Ji Yool!

19
00:01:11,877 --> 00:01:13,257
 Who ordered this?

20
00:01:13,257 --> 00:01:16,277
 Are you trying to kill her?

21
00:01:16,277 --> 00:01:19,237
 Didn't you say Ji Yool had really bad peanut allergies?

22
00:01:19,237 --> 00:01:22,787
 How could she tell such lies to have her daughter audition again?

23
00:01:22,787 --> 00:01:25,117
 This is Deputy Jang Mi Ho of the Digital Division.

24
00:01:25,117 --> 00:01:26,917
 Good to hear from you.

26
00:01:29,037 --> 00:01:30,247
 What's this?

27
00:01:30,247 --> 00:01:31,437
 My feelings.

28
00:01:31,437 --> 00:01:34,337
 I'm in front of your house. Come down now.

29
00:01:37,547 --> 00:01:39,707
- It's not hot, right?
 - Yeah.

30
00:01:42,457 --> 00:01:44,167
Why isn't this coming out?

31
00:01:46,877 --> 00:01:48,177
Honey, are you home?

32
00:01:48,177 --> 00:01:51,587
Can you get me body wash for the kids? I'm out.

33
00:01:56,017 --> 00:01:57,627
Wait!

34
00:01:59,607 --> 00:02:01,197
Yu Jin.

35
00:02:06,767 --> 00:02:08,497
My husband doesn't know.

36
00:02:08,497 --> 00:02:10,897
How do I explain this?

37
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:12,577
Yu Jin.

38
00:02:13,557 --> 00:02:15,757
Yu Jin, I asked if you're back.

39
00:02:15,757 --> 00:02:17,357
Yu Jin?

40
00:02:19,117 --> 00:02:20,487
Didn't you hear me?

41
00:02:20,487 --> 00:02:23,697
I heard you. Why were you calling me so much?

42
00:02:23,697 --> 00:02:26,557
You really can't do anything without me.

43
00:02:26,557 --> 00:02:29,847
It was so messy here, so I was cleaning a bit. Here.

44
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,127
I think someone's here.

45
00:02:32,127 --> 00:02:34,527
Who would be coming here at this hour?

46
00:02:34,527 --> 00:02:36,717
It's probably the moms.

47
00:02:36,717 --> 00:02:37,897
I'll go out and see.

48
00:02:37,897 --> 00:02:41,357
Please finish washing the kids, honey.

49
00:02:47,607 --> 00:02:49,867
Just to be clear, I gave it back.

50
00:02:49,867 --> 00:02:52,567
- I'm leaving.
 - My gosh!

51
00:02:54,467 --> 00:02:56,697
We need to talk.

52
00:02:57,957 --> 00:03:00,507
Let's talk properly after sending away the guests.

53
00:03:04,907 --> 00:03:06,677
What's taking you so long?

54
00:03:06,677 --> 00:03:09,107
I'm not feeling well.

55
00:03:10,307 --> 00:03:13,317
I'm sorry, but let's meet later.

56
00:03:15,407 --> 00:03:17,027
What's this? Unbelievable.

57
00:03:17,027 --> 00:03:19,007
She's avoiding us, right?

58
00:03:19,007 --> 00:03:20,587
Just leave her.

59
00:03:21,497 --> 00:03:25,377
Eonni, are you saying we should back off like this?

60
00:03:25,377 --> 00:03:27,927
What can you do when she says she's sick?

61
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:37,377
What are you doing not going out?

62
00:03:42,307 --> 00:03:44,057
I have to go out, don't I?

63
00:04:09,847 --> 00:04:11,177
What?

64
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:16,327
What are you so afraid will be found out?

65
00:04:18,527 --> 00:04:20,557
What do you mean?

66
00:04:20,557 --> 00:04:22,287
Let's hurry up and go.

67
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:42,487
It looks like you had a guest over.

68
00:04:42,487 --> 00:04:45,697
I came to ask if you wanted to eat some rice porridge.

69
00:04:45,697 --> 00:04:46,907
Oh, yes.

70
00:04:47,717 --> 00:04:49,287
Who?

71
00:04:49,287 --> 00:04:50,847
Are you her friend?

72
00:04:50,847 --> 00:04:52,457
No.

73
00:04:53,447 --> 00:04:55,507
I'm Jang Mi Ho.

74
00:04:57,317 --> 00:05:02,307
Oh Yu Jin won our bank's family photo event.

75
00:05:02,307 --> 00:05:05,007
We plan to have a photo shoot for the winner's family,

76
00:05:05,007 --> 00:05:06,527
so I came to propose an ad deal.

77
00:05:06,527 --> 00:05:08,717
Oh. I see.

78
00:05:08,717 --> 00:05:11,687
At this hour on a Saturday of all times.

79
00:05:12,557 --> 00:05:14,217
You're right.

80
00:05:14,217 --> 00:05:17,247
This was the only available time for us to meet.

81
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:21,307
Well, if you say so.

82
00:05:21,307 --> 00:05:23,487
I'll buy you porridge next time.

83
00:05:23,487 --> 00:05:27,097
Then, have a nice conversation.

84
00:05:36,547 --> 00:05:38,377
It was me, wasn't it?

85
00:05:42,117 --> 00:05:45,787
- I was the problem. 
 - No, it's not like that.

86
00:05:45,807 --> 00:05:48,767
Are you afraid that I might say something about you?

87
00:05:49,367 --> 00:05:51,947
And the money was to shut my mouth.

88
00:05:54,197 --> 00:05:56,427
You're exactly the same as before.

89
00:05:56,427 --> 00:05:59,197
You really haven't changed one bit.

90
00:05:59,197 --> 00:06:01,007
Look who's talking.

91
00:06:01,007 --> 00:06:03,517
What do you have to be so proud about?

92
00:06:04,307 --> 00:06:07,377
Do you think you and I are the same?

93
00:06:07,377 --> 00:06:10,507
I think you're the one who has more to lose.

94
00:06:11,427 --> 00:06:14,197
I felt it was unfair that only you were living happily.

95
00:06:14,197 --> 00:06:19,337
So, if you don't want everything you did in the past exposed, shut your mouth.

96

Dad! Mango!

Mango!

101
00:06:45,807 --> 00:06:47,547
I'm going to eat first!

102
00:06:47,547 --> 00:06:50,617
I'm going to eat first!

103
00:06:50,617 --> 00:06:52,307
I'm going to eat first!

104
00:06:52,307 --> 00:06:54,747
I'm going to eat first!

105
00:06:56,637 --> 00:06:59,217
 Hurry up and cut it up for me!

106
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:01,957
Hurry up and cut it up for us!

107
00:07:01,957 --> 00:07:03,397
Dad.

108
00:07:03,397 --> 00:07:05,737
Hurry, hurry.

109
00:07:05,737 --> 00:07:08,697
I'm trying my best.

110
00:07:08,697 --> 00:07:10,277
Give it to me.

111
00:07:10,277 --> 00:07:12,627
You take off too much flesh with the skin.

112
00:07:12,627 --> 00:07:14,277
Gosh, so cruel.

113
00:07:14,277 --> 00:07:16,577
So cruel!

114
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:22,077
Aren't we taking the photo today?

115
00:07:22,077 --> 00:07:24,157
Oh, we should.

116
00:07:24,947 --> 00:07:27,517
Shall we say "Mango" together?

117
00:07:27,517 --> 00:07:28,587
One, two, three.

118
00:07:28,587 --> 00:07:32,687
 Mango!

119
00:07:35,927 --> 00:07:37,607
 My husband, a full-time stay-at-home dad.

120
00:07:37,607 --> 00:07:40,357
 He is working hard to feed the kids today, too.

121
00:07:40,357 --> 00:07:43,667
Gosh, I'm not doing this full-time. That's an exaggeration.

122
00:07:43,667 --> 00:07:47,167
Do you know how I increased my following in a few years?

123
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:49,627
People want to see good and happy things.

124
00:07:49,627 --> 00:07:52,867
They don't want to see anything pathetic.

125
00:07:52,867 --> 00:07:54,287
And it's all true, anyway.

126
00:07:54,287 --> 00:07:57,577
No, I mean, I'm just worried people might get jealous of us.

127
00:07:57,577 --> 00:08:00,677
Don't worry, we won't get hurt.

128
00:08:01,517 --> 00:08:05,267
To protect us right now, I'll do...

129
00:08:05,267 --> 00:08:08,107
I'll do anything.

 Oh Yu Jin

133
00:08:44,137 --> 00:08:45,987
Did I go too far?

134
00:08:51,757 --> 00:08:53,947
I was a bit too harsh earli—

 Photo shoot with the"Home Sweet Home" event winner – How the photo shoot will be used

137
00:09:09,057 --> 00:09:13,757
 Photo shoot with the"Home Sweet Home" event winner

138
00:09:20,607 --> 00:09:22,247
Aigoo, so busy.

139
00:09:22,247 --> 00:09:24,947
Assistant Manager Jang and Associate Manager Lee, come to the conference room.

140
00:09:27,697 --> 00:09:29,177
Yeah?

141
00:09:31,887 --> 00:09:33,137
Okay.

142
00:09:33,137 --> 00:09:34,367
What was the problem?

143
00:09:34,367 --> 00:09:35,417
 Influencer Oh Yu Jin

144
00:09:36,717 --> 00:09:38,067
It's nothing big.

145
00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:42,847
You know our vice president likes to look trendy, copying young people.

146
00:09:42,847 --> 00:09:45,267
It's great that you came up with the follow-up plan,

147
00:09:45,267 --> 00:09:46,897
but he suggested we do the shoot with

148
00:09:46,897 --> 00:09:50,137
the Influencer Category winner Oh Yu Jin rather than the winner's family,

149
00:09:50,137 --> 00:09:52,877
 Influencer Oh Yu Jin  
saying we can't ignore the impact of social media marketing.

150
00:09:52,877 --> 00:09:54,547
I see...

151
00:09:55,787 --> 00:09:57,247
- Pardon?
 - What?

152
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,927
You said to do it with Oh Yu Jin at first, too.

153
00:09:58,927 --> 00:10:00,737
You shot it down, saying it would raise fairness issues.

154
00:10:00,737 --> 00:10:03,257
What can I do when my higher-ups are specifically asking for it?

155
00:10:03,257 --> 00:10:05,957
I'll give you enough time to fix the report.

156
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,837
- Give it to me by tomorrow.
 - What?

157
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:27,047
Assistant Manager Jang. Assistant Manager Jang?

158
00:10:27,887 --> 00:10:29,497
Assistant Manager!

159
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:36,487
Won't this blow your eardrums out?

160
00:10:36,487 --> 00:10:38,877
Why are you bothering me, following me all the way here?

161
00:10:38,877 --> 00:10:40,547
You said you'd buy me food.

162
00:10:40,547 --> 00:10:42,967
- When did I say that?
 - It's been over eight months.

163
00:10:42,967 --> 00:10:45,427
I probably didn't mean we should eat together.

164
00:10:45,427 --> 00:10:47,337
Eat. I'll pay for it.

165
00:10:47,337 --> 00:10:50,347
You're quite heartless.

166
00:10:53,227 --> 00:10:55,217
You know...

167
00:10:56,827 --> 00:11:00,817
shall I relay the message to Oh Yu Jin?

168
00:11:05,117 --> 00:11:07,467
Your food is here.

169
00:11:09,147 --> 00:11:12,767
You seem to have some kind of deep-seated feelings about her.

170
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,317
What's your relationship with her? Are you friends?

171
00:11:16,737 --> 00:11:19,297
Shut up and just eat your food.

172
00:11:29,597 --> 00:11:32,597
This is why I don't like eating with people.

173
00:11:40,687 --> 00:11:42,307
Better?

174
00:11:52,867 --> 00:11:55,887
Yeah, I'm on my way home.

175
00:11:55,887 --> 00:11:57,537
I'm a bit tired.

176
00:11:57,537 --> 00:12:00,847
Can you stop saying you're tired?

177
00:12:00,847 --> 00:12:03,627
It sounds like you're weaseling out of talking to me on the phone.

178
00:12:03,627 --> 00:12:05,407
 How could you always say that?

179
00:12:05,407 --> 00:12:07,937
 Can't you be considerate of the person who called you?

180
00:12:07,937 --> 00:12:10,807
No, Mom. Why are you being like that again?

181
00:12:11,677 --> 00:12:13,227
I'm sorry.

182
00:12:13,227 --> 00:12:15,697
Okay, I'll pick up right away.

183
00:12:15,697 --> 00:12:17,347
Mom, you hang up first.

184
00:12:17,347 --> 00:12:18,827
Okay.

185
00:12:49,547 --> 00:12:53,067
 Jeong Ah eonni  
 As you probably know, the moms are having lots of conversations about you.

186
00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:55,117
 If you don't want them all as your enemies,

187
00:12:55,117 --> 00:12:58,637
 you should bring up something that will wrap this up.

188
00:12:58,637 --> 00:13:00,667
 She's lied so many times.

189
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:03,337
 If she cheated to get the Snow role,

190
00:13:03,337 --> 00:13:06,277
 I think this should be brought up openly.

191
00:13:07,727 --> 00:13:10,507
Who could mediate this if it weren't for me?

192
00:13:17,917 --> 00:13:20,267
My lovely men.

193
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:22,157
I am feeding you today as well.

194
00:13:22,157 --> 00:13:24,407
- Thank you. 
- It looks good.

195
00:13:24,407 --> 00:13:25,967
Brother-in-law.

196
00:13:27,487 --> 00:13:32,007
 You don't want people to keep talking about what happened two years ago, right?

197
00:13:32,007 --> 00:13:34,707
 I'll look forward to your wise solution.

198
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:46,837
I asked you all to come here once again because... (in English)

199
00:13:46,837 --> 00:13:49,707
There were many objections regarding the performance, (in Korean)

200
00:13:49,707 --> 00:13:52,227
so I thought we should fine-tune some things.

201
00:13:52,227 --> 00:13:53,917
Yes.

202
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:58,797
Actually, I was the one who asked the principal to have this meeting.

203
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:04,837
My Ella won't take the role of Snow Princess for this performance.

204
00:14:07,287 --> 00:14:08,817
What is she saying?

205
00:14:09,657 --> 00:14:14,837
And I would like all other children not to take the Snow Princess role, either.

206
00:14:15,857 --> 00:14:17,517
What do you mean by that?

207
00:14:17,517 --> 00:14:20,797
I'm saying let's not do the "Red Shoes" musical.

208
00:14:21,537 --> 00:14:24,317
Then what about the performance? It's coming up very soon.

209
00:14:24,317 --> 00:14:25,417
Yes, that's right.

210
00:14:25,417 --> 00:14:26,767
It's coming up very soon,

211
00:14:26,767 --> 00:14:29,627
so we won't be able to do a musical that requires a lot of practice.

212
00:14:29,627 --> 00:14:31,717
That's why I want to make this proposal.

213
00:14:31,717 --> 00:14:34,757
How about we do a series of short musicals,

214
00:14:34,757 --> 00:14:38,177
so all the children could be the main lead?

215
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:42,217
Cinderella, The Little Match Girl, Peter Pan, and Robin Hood.

216
00:14:42,217 --> 00:14:44,417
Do the highlight scenes from these stories.

217
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:47,077
I will go out of my way to prepare everything

218
00:14:47,077 --> 00:14:50,197
from the script to the costumes, stage, and catering.

219
00:14:50,197 --> 00:14:51,727
What do you all think?

220
00:14:51,727 --> 00:14:54,987
I mean, it's better than my child being a side character.

221
00:14:54,987 --> 00:14:58,937
Well, if you say you will prepare everything, Yu Jin.

222
00:14:58,937 --> 00:15:00,587
But will you really be okay with that?

223
00:15:00,587 --> 00:15:02,397
Of course.

224
00:15:02,397 --> 00:15:04,347
This is such an obvious decision to make.

225
00:15:04,347 --> 00:15:06,677
We want to make everyone happy with the performance.

226
00:15:06,677 --> 00:15:10,147
Wouldn't it be important for everyone to be winners?

227
00:15:10,147 --> 00:15:12,497
That's not a bad solution.

228
00:15:12,497 --> 00:15:14,037
I'm in.

229
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:41,757
 Oh Yu Jin won our bank's family photo event.

230
00:15:41,757 --> 00:15:44,467
 We had plans for a photoshoot for the winner's family,

231
00:15:44,467 --> 00:15:46,897
 so I came to propose a commercial deal.

232
00:15:56,847 --> 00:15:59,877
Ji Yool, you're sad that you can't be Snow, right?

233
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:02,227
No, I'm okay.

234
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:05,687
I'm happier since I can do both Cinderella and Peter Pan.

235
00:16:05,687 --> 00:16:08,207
Gosh, good girl, Ji Yool.

236
00:16:08,207 --> 00:16:10,787
You don't want me to be upset, huh?

237
00:16:11,547 --> 00:16:12,967
It's okay.

238
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:17,207
I will make sure you shine the most, Ji Yool.

239
00:16:32,947 --> 00:16:37,417
The head of the social media marketing team of the Digital Division, please.

240
00:16:38,577 --> 00:16:41,387
Hello, this is Oh Yu Jin.

241
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:46,547
I heard you're planning to shoot an ad with the event winner.

242
00:16:48,797 --> 00:16:50,387
Oh, really?

243
00:16:50,387 --> 00:16:53,577
I still haven't received a call from the person in charge.

244
00:16:56,367 --> 00:17:00,237
Of course, I should shoot the ad.

245
00:17:07,577 --> 00:17:08,477
 Pandora's box

246

254
00:18:00,867 --> 00:18:05,487
 Welcome - 9th Herinity Winter Festival

255
00:18:10,097 --> 00:18:11,497
Yes, good.

256
00:18:14,967 --> 00:18:17,367
- Hello.
 - Welcome!

257
00:18:17,367 --> 00:18:19,917
Please go to the auditorium.

258
00:18:26,927 --> 00:18:29,117
 Jang Mi Ho

259
00:18:33,307 --> 00:18:37,877
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail.

260
00:18:42,527 --> 00:18:44,627
 Why aren't you picking up your phone?

261
00:18:44,627 --> 00:18:48,917
 You called my team leader about the photoshoot first.

262
00:18:53,107 --> 00:18:56,047
 Yu Jin, could we talk on the phone?

263
00:19:08,077 --> 00:19:10,587
 Please call me when you see this.

264
00:19:15,747 --> 00:19:17,407
Aren't you dressed too casual for this?

265
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:19,727
It's not like you just came out of your house.

266
00:19:19,727 --> 00:19:20,947
What?

267
00:19:20,947 --> 00:19:23,197
I actually dressed up for this.

268
00:19:23,197 --> 00:19:25,637
Who dresses up so fancy these days—

269
00:19:25,637 --> 00:19:29,387
How is it that you still don't know the right time and place for certain things?

270
00:19:29,387 --> 00:19:31,667
How would you live without me?

271
00:19:33,117 --> 00:19:35,797
I guess my outfit isn't the best for this, huh?

272
00:19:35,797 --> 00:19:37,437
Go get changed. I'll wait here.

273
00:19:37,437 --> 00:19:39,967
Okay. I'll be right back.

274
00:19:39,967 --> 00:19:41,677
- Wait just a little bit.
 - Okay.

275
00:19:47,737 --> 00:19:49,667
Hello.

276
00:19:53,357 --> 00:19:55,537
 Hello.

277
00:20:00,527 --> 00:20:02,487
- Honey. 
- You made it?

278
00:20:02,487 --> 00:20:04,787
I told you I wouldn't be late.

279
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,437
It's been a while. You've been well, right?

280
00:20:06,437 --> 00:20:08,107
Oh, yes.

281
00:20:13,417 --> 00:20:15,267
You made it. How about your hospital?

282
00:20:15,267 --> 00:20:17,977
Is it okay to see you every time there's an event?

283
00:20:17,977 --> 00:20:21,457
It's pretty slow these days since the discount event for test takers is over.

284
00:20:21,457 --> 00:20:23,777
He's doing it because he can.

285
00:20:23,777 --> 00:20:28,027
He's the hospital director, so he can be freer even if he's busy.

286
00:20:29,057 --> 00:20:30,737
Everything's going well with the company, right?

287
00:20:30,737 --> 00:20:35,797
I heard that Eonni leaves most of the company management to you.

288
00:20:35,797 --> 00:20:37,537
Oh, yes. Well—

289
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:40,247
Though he looks mild-tempered, he's actually pretty tough.

290
00:20:40,247 --> 00:20:45,367
He planned the detox drink that we released last month.

291
00:20:45,367 --> 00:20:48,087
Oh, really?

292
00:20:48,087 --> 00:20:51,177
Then, you don't need to fill your social media with ads.

293
00:20:51,177 --> 00:20:54,737
Others might think you do that because you can't trust your husband.

294
00:20:54,737 --> 00:20:57,627
I support him because I am capable of that.

295
00:20:57,627 --> 00:20:59,817
Don't you think I do it because it's worthwhile?

296
00:20:59,817 --> 00:21:02,367
- Did you eat?
 - Yeah, omakase.

297
00:21:02,367 --> 00:21:05,307
- You said Ji Yool will perform third, right?
 - Yeah. Gold class.

298
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:07,407
Hello.

299
00:21:07,407 --> 00:21:09,717
Welcome.

300
00:21:10,917 --> 00:21:12,637
- Let's go. 
- Yeah.

301
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:16,177
Eonnis.

302
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:20,867
You made it.

303
00:21:20,867 --> 00:21:23,297
You look so pretty today, Na Yeong.

304
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:27,517
It's a special day, so I dressed up for the occasion.

305
00:21:27,517 --> 00:21:29,427
- It's been a while.
 - Yes.

306
00:21:29,427 --> 00:21:31,197
Have you been well?

307
00:21:45,507 --> 00:21:47,057
I need quiet.

308
00:21:47,867 --> 00:21:49,567
Everyone, get ready.

309
00:21:49,567 --> 00:21:50,707
Okay.

310
00:21:50,707 --> 00:21:52,747
Where is Ms. Ah Ra?

311
00:21:53,757 --> 00:21:55,907
Sorry, I'm here.

312
00:21:55,907 --> 00:21:57,897
Where did you go?

313
00:21:57,897 --> 00:21:59,647
The bathroom...

314
00:22:00,927 --> 00:22:03,507
- Let's talk after.
 -  I'm sorry.

315
00:22:03,507 --> 00:22:05,147
Okay, everyone, let's line up.

316
00:22:05,147 --> 00:22:06,847
Come by often.

317
00:22:10,967 --> 00:22:13,297
- Where were you?
 - The bathroom.

318
00:22:13,297 --> 00:22:14,977
It's starting now.

319
00:22:23,077 --> 00:22:25,377
Everyone is welcome here.

320
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:29,347
And now, the moment you have all been waiting for.

321
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:35,847

 Oppa, you were so handsome today.

333
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:22,817
 I fell in love again.

334
00:23:31,997 --> 00:23:35,057
 My Prince: You were also so pretty that I only had eyes for you.

335
00:23:41,507 --> 00:23:43,197
Hello, everyone.

336
00:23:43,197 --> 00:23:45,827
My name is Chloe.

337
00:23:45,827 --> 00:23:51,427
I'm going to tell you about my favorite family giving.

338
00:23:51,427 --> 00:23:53,637
What they liked to do...

339
00:23:53,637 --> 00:23:55,207
Be still family.

340
00:23:55,207 --> 00:23:59,027
Oh, my, it's snowing heavily.

341
00:23:59,027 --> 00:24:05,067
If I don't sell these matches, my family will starve.

342
00:24:06,217 --> 00:24:08,797
Please, little girl.

343
00:24:08,797 --> 00:24:14,157
Don't you need the matches to keep you warm in this bitter cold?

344
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:17,347
 "Get away"

345
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:19,857
"Get away."

346
00:24:20,697 --> 00:24:24,277
I don't want to say, "Get away."

347
00:24:31,467 --> 00:24:33,187
What's wrong with that?

348
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:38,677
I so dearly want to go to the castle.

349
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:44,217
If my parents were here, none of this would have happened.

350
00:24:47,227 --> 00:24:49,877
Oh, my beautiful Cinderella.

351
00:24:49,877 --> 00:24:52,417
Don't waste your tears.

352
00:24:52,417 --> 00:24:55,367
You too will go to the ball.

353
00:24:55,367 --> 00:24:57,497
I'll help you.

354
00:25:04,887 --> 00:25:07,597
Don't hit me!

355
00:25:32,537 --> 00:25:36,667
Ji Yool, are you okay? 
 - I'm sorry!

356
00:25:44,657 --> 00:25:47,537
It appears that the performance has gotten a bit overheated.

357
00:25:47,537 --> 00:25:50,357
I think our children need a break.

358
00:25:50,357 --> 00:25:53,697
We'll resume in ten minutes.

359
00:26:01,887 --> 00:26:03,587
Ji Yool, are you okay?

360
00:26:03,587 --> 00:26:05,017
It must've been stressful for her.

361
00:26:05,017 --> 00:26:06,617
Look how pale she looks.

362
00:26:06,617 --> 00:26:11,200
H-How is Ji Yool?

363
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,627
I think she got a bit frightened, but she's okay now.

364
00:26:15,627 --> 00:26:18,637
Ji Hye, don't worry about it too much.

365
00:26:18,637 --> 00:26:21,897
You know how children aren't able to control their strength well.

366
00:26:21,897 --> 00:26:27,007
So Won tends to make big gestures when she gets excited. 
 - Pardon?

367
00:26:27,007 --> 00:26:29,247
She got hit slightly by So Won's wand,

368
00:26:29,247 --> 00:26:33,057
but I think Ji Yool was shaken up because she wasn't expecting it.

369
00:26:34,097 --> 00:26:35,937
I think we should head home first.

370
00:26:35,937 --> 00:26:37,687
Honey, could you bring Ha Yool?

371
00:26:37,687 --> 00:26:39,487
Oh, okay.

372
00:26:45,367 --> 00:26:47,767
It's really okay.

373
00:26:55,187 --> 00:26:56,797
Hey!

374
00:26:58,217 --> 00:27:00,107
What do you mean, Ji Yool got hit by the wand?

375
00:27:00,107 --> 00:27:02,037
The wand didn't even touch Ji Yool.

376
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:05,077
I didn't expect you to apologize, but I'm a bit disappointed.

377
00:27:05,077 --> 00:27:08,057
It's not like the situation changes if you insist.

378
00:27:08,717 --> 00:27:13,807
But I still understand why you want to believe that, Ji Hye.

379
00:27:13,807 --> 00:27:15,057
What did you just say?

380
00:27:15,057 --> 00:27:17,627
What kind of nonsense is that?

381
00:27:18,687 --> 00:27:19,837
Let's stop.

382
00:27:19,837 --> 00:27:22,557
So Won must be shocked, too, so please comfort her.

383
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:26,297
And tell her that children grow up by making mistakes.

384
00:27:27,117 --> 00:27:31,907
You don't perhaps still have a grudge against me, do you?

385
00:27:36,777 --> 00:27:39,387
Wait. H-Hey!

386
00:27:40,747 --> 00:27:42,057
What are you doing right now?

387
00:27:42,057 --> 00:27:45,257
Why bring up the past and sneakily put the blame on my daughter?

388
00:27:45,257 --> 00:27:47,347
I saw it with my own two eyes.

389
00:27:47,347 --> 00:27:51,057
Why say such nonsense that my So Won hit her?

390
00:27:51,057 --> 00:27:54,237
Please watch your language when children are listening.

391
00:27:54,237 --> 00:27:57,387
You can continue to believe that, Ji Hye.

392
00:28:00,247 --> 00:28:05,577
You even lied about the peanut allergy. You really are full of lies.

393
00:28:07,167 --> 00:28:10,377
It looks like you're making stuff up since there's no evidence right now,

394
00:28:10,377 --> 00:28:12,457
but I guess we can expose it here.

395
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:15,047
There is a CCTV in the auditorium.

396
00:28:15,047 --> 00:28:18,147
There were quite a few parents who were filming at that moment.

397
00:28:18,147 --> 00:28:19,677
Let's take a look!

398
00:28:19,677 --> 00:28:22,567
Let's see if my So Won really hit Ji Yool or not!

399
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:26,697
Excuse me, I filmed it from the side. You could get a clear answer—

400
00:28:26,697 --> 00:28:28,477
What are you all doing right now?

401
00:28:28,477 --> 00:28:30,707
Don't you see how shocked the kids are?

402
00:28:30,707 --> 00:28:32,567
Is this the time to talk about whose fault it is?

403
00:28:32,567 --> 00:28:34,187
Why are you deflecting now?

404
00:28:34,187 --> 00:28:36,587
Are you afraid your lies will be exposed?

405
00:28:36,587 --> 00:28:38,317
Look how much she's sweating.

406
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:40,497
Today was an event for the kids.

407
00:28:40,497 --> 00:28:43,527
How do you think your attitude will reflect on the kids?

408
00:28:43,527 --> 00:28:46,357
- Honey.
- Think deeply about it, all of you.

409
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:48,447
We'll be going now.

410
00:28:55,747 --> 00:28:57,797
What is this about now?

411
00:29:05,847 --> 00:29:08,727
You can tell Mommy and Daddy honestly.

412
00:29:08,727 --> 00:29:10,327
Why did you act like that?

413
00:29:10,327 --> 00:29:12,057
Was the wand scary?

414
00:29:12,057 --> 00:29:14,037
Did you feel like you would get hit?

415
00:29:17,087 --> 00:29:19,667
I wonder why you acted like that, Ji Yool.

416
00:29:22,117 --> 00:29:23,467
Honey, you should stop.

417
00:29:23,467 --> 00:29:25,527
I'll take care of it.

418
00:29:25,527 --> 00:29:28,297
I guess you don't want to talk.

419
00:29:28,297 --> 00:29:32,417
Let's go home and draw like you like to do, Ji Yool.

420
00:29:35,177 --> 00:29:36,807
It's not hot, right?

421
00:29:36,807 --> 00:29:40,257
Let's wash our hands.

422
00:29:42,757 --> 00:29:44,647
It's hot.

423
00:29:50,507 --> 00:29:52,937
 Tree Drawing Test

424
00:29:54,527 --> 00:29:56,727
Let's try drawing a tree.

425
00:29:56,727 --> 00:30:00,727
But I want to draw Princess Sophia and a racing car.

426
00:30:00,727 --> 00:30:03,447
Let's draw a tree first, okay?

427
00:30:04,267 --> 00:30:06,367
Then, can I draw it however I want?

428
00:30:06,367 --> 00:30:10,387
Of course. You can draw it however you want, Ji Yool.

429
00:30:13,257 --> 00:30:17,597
 Typically, the trunk of a tree reflects a child's emotions about

430
00:30:17,597 --> 00:30:22,497
 energy, creativity, vitality, and life in growth and development.

431
00:30:22,497 --> 00:30:26,997
Hey, Ji Yool, shall we draw the trunk a bit wider?

432
00:30:30,687 --> 00:30:33,407
 A meager branch drawn with a single line

433
00:30:33,407 --> 00:30:36,847
 reflects frustration and helplessness.

434
00:30:36,847 --> 00:30:38,367
You should draw apples, too.

435
00:30:38,367 --> 00:30:40,777
The tree is too lonely.

436
00:30:43,307 --> 00:30:46,157
 Since the fruit represents a desire to achieve things...

437
00:30:46,157 --> 00:30:50,997
Let's draw them prettily, like this.

438
00:30:50,997 --> 00:30:53,447
Like this.

439
00:30:55,497 --> 00:30:57,777
Hello?
 -  It's me.

440
00:31:00,657 --> 00:31:02,607
 Jang Mi Ho

441
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:07,117
Ji Yool, just a moment.

442
00:31:12,777 --> 00:31:14,777
Did you see my text?

443
00:31:14,777 --> 00:31:16,457
I called you several times.

444
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:19,587
I was busy because of my children's performance.

445
00:31:19,587 --> 00:31:22,527
Also, I heard you were going to make the proposal first.

446
00:31:22,527 --> 00:31:25,027
 Why didn't you say anything?

447
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,907
I left you a text with the details.

448
00:31:31,907 --> 00:31:34,387
The ad will be shot with your kids.

449
00:31:34,387 --> 00:31:35,927
The kids?

450
00:31:42,957 --> 00:31:47,277
Let's see. What's my daughter drawing?

451
00:31:53,157 --> 00:31:55,697
What's a good date for you?

452
00:31:55,697 --> 00:31:58,057
 But now that I think about it, I'm not sure.

453
00:31:58,057 --> 00:32:00,527
 My kids will be exposed to the public.

454
00:32:00,527 --> 00:32:02,897
Why are you going back on what you said?

455
00:32:03,337 --> 00:32:05,397
Don't do it if you don't want to.

456
00:32:07,187 --> 00:32:09,837
Really? Then, should I not do it?

457
00:32:10,677 --> 00:32:13,997
 If it's difficult for you, I'll call the Team Leader.

458
00:32:13,997 --> 00:32:15,987
Because he asked me a few times,

459
00:32:15,987 --> 00:32:19,027
I was going to think positively about it.

460
00:32:19,027 --> 00:32:20,417
But it's too bad.

461
00:32:20,417 --> 00:32:22,237
Oh, right.

462
00:32:22,237 --> 00:32:25,067
I heard your promotion is coming up soon.

463
00:32:35,077 --> 00:32:37,967
You don't need to decide right now.

464
00:32:38,857 --> 00:32:41,127
Call me when you decide.

465
00:33:34,597 --> 00:33:36,427
Where did she go?

466
00:33:50,257 --> 00:33:53,237
 New Folder

467
00:33:53,237 --> 00:33:54,887
 Jang Mi Ho

468
00:34:12,077 --> 00:34:15,577
 Jang Mi Ho

469
00:34:23,567 --> 00:34:26,407
 I made up my mind. I'll do it.

470
00:34:29,957 --> 00:34:36,047
I think it will be good to go for a holy look for Oh Yu Jin's facial expression.

471
00:34:36,047 --> 00:34:38,867
The kids' facial expressions are the key.

472
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:49,537
Please put the food over here.

473
00:34:49,537 --> 00:34:51,517
And put that over here.

474
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,747
Mi Ho.

475
00:35:11,197 --> 00:35:12,947
Kids, this is Auntie.

476
00:35:12,947 --> 00:35:14,327
Did you say hello?

477
00:35:14,327 --> 00:35:16,917
We have lots of zunties.

478
00:35:16,917 --> 00:35:19,477
This time, she's a real auntie.

479
00:35:19,477 --> 00:35:21,637
Real Auntie?

480
00:35:24,337 --> 00:35:25,897
Hi.

481
00:35:30,257 --> 00:35:33,987
The bank catered the food especially for us.

482
00:35:33,987 --> 00:35:36,277
Gosh, it's so pretty.

483
00:35:37,567 --> 00:35:41,007
I should really thank the bank president. It's so tasty.

484
00:35:41,007 --> 00:35:42,767
Oh, my.

485
00:35:43,987 --> 00:35:46,357
Gosh, that was close.

486
00:35:47,127 --> 00:35:50,047
I'll show you around the studio.

487
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:53,227
All right, if you come over here...

488
00:35:53,227 --> 00:35:54,937
Ta-da!

489
00:35:55,657 --> 00:36:00,427
If you look here, these are the outfits Ha Yool and Ji Yool will wear today.

490
00:36:00,427 --> 00:36:02,547
Aren't they so pretty?

491
00:36:06,527 --> 00:36:10,657
Ta-da! It's the dressing room.

492
00:36:10,657 --> 00:36:12,477
Isn't it so nice?

493
00:36:12,477 --> 00:36:15,927
If you look over here, oh my, they even prepared toys

494
00:36:15,927 --> 00:36:19,337
 for Ji Yool and Ha Yool to play with.

495
00:36:19,337 --> 00:36:21,817
 - Then, I'll...  
- Showing off...

496
00:36:23,057 --> 00:36:24,537
Thank you, ma'am.

497
00:36:24,537 --> 00:36:26,197
Please enjoy it.

498
00:36:26,197 --> 00:36:28,397
 Thank you.

499
00:36:30,167 --> 00:36:34,317
Even with this, can you say my So Won hit Ji Yool?

500
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:39,077
Here. It's all right here!

501
00:36:42,777 --> 00:36:47,250
Ms. Hwang, how about you let this go

502
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:50,540
for the sake of everyone?

503
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:57,167
What mother would let it go when her daughter is unfairly blamed for something she didn't do?

504
00:37:04,337 --> 00:37:06,227
Mrs. Kim!

505
00:37:09,737 --> 00:37:13,777
I have a strange feeling about something.

506
00:37:13,777 --> 00:37:15,987
Could you take a look at this?

507
00:37:24,187 --> 00:37:25,847
Yes, that's good.

508
00:37:25,847 --> 00:37:29,237
Yes, let's smile big. That's good.

509
00:37:29,237 --> 00:37:32,397
Yes, that's good, very good.

510
00:37:32,397 --> 00:37:35,127
Yes, that's good.

511
00:37:37,077 --> 00:37:39,087
Let's look this way.

512
00:37:39,087 --> 00:37:40,617
Yes, that's good.

513
00:37:40,617 --> 00:37:43,467
So pretty. Gosh, so pretty.

514
00:37:43,467 --> 00:37:47,297
Ji Yool is like a model student, while Ha Yool is a bit silly.

515
00:37:47,297 --> 00:37:49,207
They are complete opposites.

516
00:37:49,207 --> 00:37:51,557
But they still get along well.

517
00:37:51,557 --> 00:37:53,977
Ji Yool takes good care of Ha Yool

518
00:37:53,977 --> 00:37:56,207
since she's the older sister.

519
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,367
Nice.

520
00:38:00,817 --> 00:38:02,927
- Back then—
 - Back then,

521
00:38:04,807 --> 00:38:07,467
I misunderstood.

522
00:38:07,467 --> 00:38:10,307
I thought you were trying to threaten me.

523
00:38:10,307 --> 00:38:15,317
I got so scared at that moment that I did something ridiculous.

524
00:38:18,057 --> 00:38:21,557
I have no intention of threatening you with what happened in the past.

525
00:38:21,557 --> 00:38:23,477
Why would I do that?

526
00:38:27,067 --> 00:38:31,867
Meeting you once sometime later in my life was my lifelong assignment.

527
00:38:33,487 --> 00:38:35,667
To be blunt,

528
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:39,057
we were both perpetrators against each other.

529
00:38:39,057 --> 00:38:41,597
So we should apologize to each other and resolve our past—

530
00:38:41,597 --> 00:38:43,377
Wait.

531
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:47,817
Why should I apologize?

532
00:38:47,817 --> 00:38:50,597
All I said was I thought you'd threaten me with the past.

533
00:38:50,597 --> 00:38:54,027
I didn't say what happened in the past was my fault.

534
00:38:57,927 --> 00:38:59,507
All right.

535
00:39:01,207 --> 00:39:04,047
Honestly, I was a bit flustered back then.

536
00:39:04,047 --> 00:39:09,417
It was a past I wanted to hide, though it wasn't my fault.

537
00:39:09,417 --> 00:39:11,837
But now that I think about it,

538
00:39:12,647 --> 00:39:14,217
why should I?

539
00:39:15,007 --> 00:39:17,677
It wasn't even my fault, so why?

540
00:39:17,677 --> 00:39:19,177
You...

541
00:39:21,427 --> 00:39:23,827
You don't think at all about what you did, do you?

542
00:39:23,827 --> 00:39:26,827
What I did? What did I do?

543
00:39:26,827 --> 00:39:30,057
All I did was pay you back for what you did.

544
00:39:30,057 --> 00:39:31,487
We'll take a brief break.

545
00:39:31,487 --> 00:39:33,867
Let's take a 10-minute break.

546
00:39:38,367 --> 00:39:43,827
I wanted us to meet today, apologize to each other, and resolve bad feelings.

547
00:39:43,827 --> 00:39:46,747
You're really something else.

548
00:39:46,747 --> 00:39:49,817
How could you even think of receiving an apology from me?

549
00:39:49,817 --> 00:39:54,177
Is it my fault for expecting a bit of shame or conscience from you?

550
00:40:06,097 --> 00:40:09,237
Oh, my. What's going on?

551
00:40:09,237 --> 00:40:11,687
Ha Yool, Ha Yool!

552
00:40:11,687 --> 00:40:13,847
Ha Yool, what's wrong?

553
00:40:13,847 --> 00:40:15,367
- Ha Yool!
- Hey, move.

554
00:40:15,367 --> 00:40:18,217
Are you crazy? Ha Yool, what's wrong?

555
00:40:18,217 --> 00:40:20,237
I said move!

556
00:40:23,757 --> 00:40:26,057
What are you doing? 
 - Spit it out, spit it out.

557
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:28,137
Give her to me, give her to me!

558
00:40:28,137 --> 00:40:30,127
Give me Ha Yool!

559
00:40:30,927 --> 00:40:32,857
Give her to me!

560
00:40:40,947 --> 00:40:44,197
- Mom!
 - It's okay, it's okay, my girl...

561
00:40:44,197 --> 00:40:46,437
Ha Yool, are you okay?

562
00:40:46,437 --> 00:40:48,877
How dare you touch her? Are you crazy?

563
00:40:48,877 --> 00:40:52,257
Who put that kind of candy here when there are kids!

564
00:40:52,257 --> 00:40:54,177
Oh, sorry. I really didn't think of this.

565
00:40:54,177 --> 00:40:56,927
I won't let this slide!

566
00:40:56,927 --> 00:41:00,747
I'll report everything you've done up until now to the bank.

567
00:41:00,747 --> 00:41:04,867
- Yu Jin—
 - Do you still not get what you did to me?

568
00:41:04,867 --> 00:41:07,737
You almost killed me a long time ago,

569
00:41:07,737 --> 00:41:10,577
and you almost killed my daughter today.

570
00:41:14,797 --> 00:41:16,437
Ji Yool, come here.

571
00:41:42,347 --> 00:41:45,607
Assistant Manager Jang, are you okay?

572
00:42:09,947 --> 00:42:12,667
Mom, is something wrong?

573
00:42:15,207 --> 00:42:16,837
Yeah...

574
00:42:18,737 --> 00:42:20,347
Let's go.

575
00:42:28,747 --> 00:42:31,517
Does she know anything about misfortune?

576
00:42:34,327 --> 00:42:36,037
I wonder what kind of blessing she has.

577
00:42:36,037 --> 00:42:39,297
I know. Even though I feel like we live a similar life,

578
00:42:39,297 --> 00:42:41,927
I feel like we can't ever get to her level.

579
00:42:44,767 --> 00:42:47,457
Since we're on the topic,

580
00:42:47,457 --> 00:42:49,497
have you heard the rumor?

581
00:42:50,517 --> 00:42:54,647
You know that day, Ji Yool was a bit strange.

582
00:42:56,087 --> 00:42:59,567
I think it could be abuse.

583
00:42:59,567 --> 00:43:01,397
Abuse?

584
00:43:01,397 --> 00:43:05,057
Well, I mean, I'm saying it's suspicious.

585
00:43:05,057 --> 00:43:09,427
It's possible to get frightened by the sudden swing of the wand.

586
00:43:09,427 --> 00:43:12,897
She could also say, "Please don't hit me."

587
00:43:12,897 --> 00:43:18,617
But what's with "I'm sorry"? Don't you think?

588
00:43:23,117 --> 00:43:26,807
Gosh, no way. Why would you say that?

589
00:43:26,807 --> 00:43:29,447
Yu Jin's family seems so genuine.

590
00:43:30,347 --> 00:43:33,597
You can pretend to be anything on social media.

591
00:43:33,597 --> 00:43:38,507
And none of the suspicions have been resolved yet.

592
00:43:42,977 --> 00:43:44,697
Oh, Eonni!

593
00:43:45,867 --> 00:43:51,267
I wondered where the source of the gossip and rumors was.

594
00:43:51,267 --> 00:43:53,517
It turns out it was here.

595
00:43:53,517 --> 00:43:55,447
Oh, i-it's not like that.

596
00:43:55,447 --> 00:43:58,287
You were going around spreading such rumors, I see.

597
00:43:59,097 --> 00:44:02,057
No, Eonni. It's not like that. Well, so Ji Hye—

598
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:07,077
I... won't just sit back and watch.

599
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:11,017
I can tolerate everything else, but you never should've messed with my family.

600
00:44:11,017 --> 00:44:14,027
I won't let others insult my family like this.

601
00:44:14,027 --> 00:44:15,737
No matter who it is,

602
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:19,417
I'll make sure they pay for their careless words.

603
00:44:20,237 --> 00:44:21,767
Just wait and see.

604
00:44:22,767 --> 00:44:27,077
Come on, Eonni. Eonni, Eonni! Gosh, what do I do?

605
00:44:43,757 --> 00:44:45,917
Eonni, what do I do now?

606
00:44:45,917 --> 00:44:49,527
You blabbered on. What do you want me to do about it?

607
00:44:49,527 --> 00:44:51,517
Your mouth is the problem.

608
00:44:51,517 --> 00:44:55,437
Can't you just stop making up stories?

609
00:44:55,437 --> 00:44:58,137
Eonni! How could you say that to me?

610
00:44:58,137 --> 00:44:59,647
You're the one who egged me on!

611
00:44:59,647 --> 00:45:03,187
When did I do that? Don't accuse me.

612
00:45:03,187 --> 00:45:04,987
Eonni!

613
00:45:04,987 --> 00:45:08,367
Gosh, seriously!

614
00:45:11,117 --> 00:45:14,197
 The man who can't live without me

615
00:45:19,097 --> 00:45:23,377
Hey, Honey. What do I do?

616
00:45:31,107 --> 00:45:34,817
Mom, you said you'd put a band-aid on me.

617
00:45:34,817 --> 00:45:36,447
Let me take a look.

618
00:45:37,907 --> 00:45:40,417
Ha Yool, it must've hurt so much.

619
00:45:40,417 --> 00:45:42,237
Just wait a little bit.

620
00:45:56,297 --> 00:45:57,797
 I came to give this back.

621
00:45:57,797 --> 00:45:59,767
 Why did you give me this?

622
00:45:59,767 --> 00:46:03,247
 I have no intention of threatening you with what happened in the past.

623
00:46:03,247 --> 00:46:05,407
 Why would I do that?

624
00:46:17,687 --> 00:46:19,537
There you go.

625
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:25,457
 Yu Jin, I saw the livestream.

626
00:46:25,457 --> 00:46:27,987
 I'm so jealous.

627
00:46:31,617 --> 00:46:34,417
 My Ha Yool got hurt while shooting the ad.

628
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:36,767
 She got a scratch on such a pretty knee.

629
00:46:36,767 --> 00:46:39,137
 I got a scratch on my heart as well.

630
00:46:39,137 --> 00:46:44,037
 Since my child's well-being comes first, I decided not to shoot the ad.

631
00:46:50,477 --> 00:46:53,247
Mom, you got hurt, too?

632
00:46:55,167 --> 00:46:56,437
It's okay.

633
00:46:56,437 --> 00:46:59,657
I will put a band-aid on you.

634
00:47:04,507 --> 00:47:06,137
 I said move!

635
00:47:06,137 --> 00:47:08,407
 You almost killed me a long time ago,

636
00:47:08,407 --> 00:47:11,177
 and you almost killed my daughter today.

637
00:47:15,327 --> 00:47:18,077
Mom, what's wrong?

638
00:47:18,587 --> 00:47:20,627
Does it hurt a lot?

639
00:47:23,967 --> 00:47:25,027
Yeah.

640
00:47:25,767 --> 00:47:27,667
It hurts.

641
00:47:57,467 --> 00:47:58,527

 Hello, did you receive the spokesmodel gift for the Domestic Eyewear New Collection?

648
00:48:39,497 --> 00:48:44,247
 Please post on your feed based on the guidelines we discussed.

649
00:48:44,247 --> 00:48:47,727
 There were so many pretty ones. I had such a hard time picking.

650
00:48:47,727 --> 00:48:50,637
 I hope they like my gift.

651
00:48:52,577 --> 00:48:56,297
 As usual, our Yu Jin's good taste hasn't changed.

652
00:48:56,297 --> 00:48:57,457
 Who will you give them to?

653
00:48:57,457 --> 00:49:00,837
 I'm so jealous of the person you're gifting them to.

654
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,800
 Isabelle Marant

655
00:49:14,917 --> 00:49:17,097
You thought of me?

656
00:49:17,097 --> 00:49:19,607
Eonni, I'm so touched!

657
00:49:19,607 --> 00:49:21,267
They're so pretty!

658
00:49:21,267 --> 00:49:23,237
Gosh, they were made for you, Na Yeong.

659
00:49:23,237 --> 00:49:24,867
They look good on you.

660
00:49:24,867 --> 00:49:27,407
I must be so blessed.

661
00:49:27,407 --> 00:49:30,197
I even get things like this from a friend.

662
00:49:30,197 --> 00:49:33,057
It's nothing. I do it because I want to.

663
00:49:33,057 --> 00:49:36,847
Even so, who actually does this like you do?

664
00:49:36,847 --> 00:49:39,087
Thank you, Eonni.

665
00:49:49,317 --> 00:49:52,077
 DGB Financial Group

666
00:49:52,077 --> 00:49:54,407
 2 weeks later

667
00:49:55,437 --> 00:49:57,297
All right, I'm taking the picture.

668
00:49:57,297 --> 00:50:00,067
Okay. One, two, three!

669
00:50:01,767 --> 00:50:03,477
Yes, we're done.

670
00:50:03,477 --> 00:50:06,707
- Good work, everyone.
 - Good work, everyone!

671
00:50:06,707 --> 00:50:08,527
Good work, Assistant Manager Jang. You, too, Associate Manager Lee.

672
00:50:08,527 --> 00:50:11,407
Gosh, I'm so relieved now.

673
00:50:11,407 --> 00:50:13,847
Though there was some trouble, I'm glad nobody was hurt.

674
00:50:13,847 --> 00:50:15,437
That's good enough.

675
00:50:24,847 --> 00:50:29,807
♫  When I forced my eyes open  ♫

676
00:50:32,467 --> 00:50:37,067
♫  I was still alone  ♫

677
00:50:38,467 --> 00:50:45,967
♫  The same days I couldn't get used to  ♫

678
00:50:47,657 --> 00:50:52,077
♫  In the end, I'm right back where I started  ♫

679
00:50:52,077 --> 00:50:54,837
 My Ha Yool got hurt while shooting the ad.

680
00:50:54,837 --> 00:50:57,287
 She got a scratch on her pretty knee.

681
00:50:57,287 --> 00:50:59,847
 I got a scratch on my heart as well.

682
00:51:01,467 --> 00:51:08,547
♫  Since tomorrow is always so far away  ♫

683
00:51:08,547 --> 00:51:13,367
♫  Beyond the dim light  ♫

684
00:51:13,367 --> 00:51:23,837
♫  Everyone in this trembling world seems to have fallen asleep  ♫

685
00:51:23,837 --> 00:51:33,367
♫  With small cowering shoulders, I look for someone's arms to fall asleep in  ♫

686
00:51:33,367 --> 00:51:42,337
♫  I turn around and head home  ♫

687
00:51:43,577 --> 00:51:46,897
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail.

688
00:51:46,897 --> 00:51:49,837

Is she ignoring me or can't get to the phone?

689
00:51:49,837 --> 00:51:52,117
 It's a date night for us tonight.

690
00:51:52,117 --> 00:51:54,127
 Kids are away at an overnight camp,

691
00:51:54,127 --> 00:51:56,777
 and we plan for a cozy night together.

692
00:51:56,777 --> 00:51:58,267
What's this?

693
00:51:59,487 --> 00:52:01,447
She was home?

694
00:52:30,857 --> 00:52:33,217
What do we do about this...

695
00:52:33,217 --> 00:52:35,207
I guess you can't eat this.

696
00:52:35,207 --> 00:52:37,337
I was just going to leave it and go.

697
00:52:40,627 --> 00:52:43,767
I was wondering if Ha Yool was okay.

698
00:52:43,767 --> 00:52:47,187
Apart from our past, this time was my responsibility,

699
00:52:47,187 --> 00:52:48,857
so I wanted to apologize.

700
00:52:48,857 --> 00:52:50,657
Get out of my face.

701
00:52:52,207 --> 00:52:54,257
Hey, Oh Yu Jin.

702
00:52:54,257 --> 00:52:56,397
Aren't you being a bit too much?

703
00:52:56,397 --> 00:52:58,407
I came to apologize to you!

704
00:52:58,407 --> 00:53:01,097
You disgust me.

705
00:53:01,097 --> 00:53:02,957
If it weren't...

706
00:53:02,957 --> 00:53:05,397
Only if it weren't for you...

707
00:53:08,567 --> 00:53:11,167
I wish you would just die.

708
00:53:23,167 --> 00:53:24,367
Hey.

709
00:53:25,187 --> 00:53:26,967
That's what I should say.

710
00:53:26,967 --> 00:53:29,457
Hey, open the door.

711
00:53:29,457 --> 00:53:31,707
 You think only you can have your say?

712
00:53:31,707 --> 00:53:33,637
 Hey, Oh Yu Jin!

713
00:53:46,707 --> 00:53:48,597
People like you...

714
00:53:50,177 --> 00:53:52,487
disgust me, too.

715
00:54:23,387 --> 00:54:25,687
 Oh Yu Jin

716
00:54:31,637 --> 00:54:34,157
What? You have something more to say?

717
00:54:34,157 --> 00:54:36,377
I left like you told me to.

718
00:54:37,137 --> 00:54:39,227
 ...elp me.

719
00:54:45,087 --> 00:54:46,447
Hey, Oh Yu Jin...

720
00:54:46,447 --> 00:54:49,287
 You... know... the number...

721
00:54:58,997 --> 00:55:01,257
Yu Jin, Oh Yu Jin.

722
00:55:01,257 --> 00:55:03,417
Is something the matter?

723
00:55:03,417 --> 00:55:05,487
 Hel...

724
00:55:06,167 --> 00:55:08,187
 Oh Yu Jin

725
00:55:12,837 --> 00:55:14,127
 Oh Yu Jin

726
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:37,357
What is this? Is she playing with me?

727
00:55:55,467 --> 00:55:57,497
 - Did you hear what happened?
 - Did you watch the news?

728
00:55:57,497 --> 00:55:59,047
 They're saying that woman died!

729
00:55:59,047 --> 00:56:00,737
 - Oh, my. Look at the article. 
- She died?

730
00:56:00,737 --> 00:56:01,887
 Wait, this is my neighborhood!

731
00:56:01,887 --> 00:56:03,807
 I was so shocked when I saw it, too.

732
00:56:03,807 --> 00:56:06,527
 That's what I mean. It's so scary!

733
00:56:06,527 --> 00:56:08,237
 She really died? Did you see the news?

734
00:56:08,237 --> 00:56:10,897
 - What do we do?
- It's crazy.

735
00:56:10,897 --> 00:56:13,927
 - She really died?
 - She's famous on social media.

736
00:56:13,927 --> 00:56:16,077
 It's that famous woman on social media.

737
00:56:16,077 --> 00:56:17,767
 That woman?

738
00:56:17,767 --> 00:56:19,757
 Oh, no.

739
00:56:19,757 --> 00:56:21,097
 Who?

740
00:56:21,097 --> 00:56:23,177
 Oh, no...

741
00:56:23,897 --> 00:56:25,237
 Oh, my...

742
00:56:25,237 --> 00:56:27,697
 - Goodness... 
- I know...

743
00:56:29,747 --> 00:56:32,927
Deputy, did you see this?

744
00:56:34,817 --> 00:56:38,287
 May she rest in peace.

745
00:56:38,287 --> 00:56:43,117
 May she rest in peace.

 We're mothers from the same kindergarten as Yu Jin's kids.

756
00:58:11,627 --> 00:58:14,277
 But who is she that she's sitting with the bereaved?

757
00:58:14,277 --> 00:58:15,647
 What are the police saying?

758
00:58:15,647 --> 00:58:18,377
 Do they say it's a murder, and are there any suspects?

759
00:58:18,377 --> 00:58:19,937
 Are you okay?

760
00:58:19,937 --> 00:58:21,977
 Please take care of them for a month or two.

761
00:58:21,977 --> 00:58:23,927
  A relative is the best option, right?

762
00:58:23,927 --> 00:58:25,857
 I'm not a relative, though.

763
00:58:25,857 --> 00:58:28,287
 I don't want to! I want to go home!

764
00:58:28,287 --> 00:58:31,917
 I want to see Mommy...

765
00:58:31,917 --> 00:58:34,077
 Did you know rumors about you are spreading in the bank?

766
00:58:34,077 --> 00:58:37,057
 I heard the police questioned you many times.

767

 You... know... number...

768
00:58:38,617 --> 00:58:39,927
 Hey.

769
00:58:39,927 --> 00:58:43,047
 What do you mean to catch the culprit? She's already dead.

770
00:58:44,527 --> 00:58:47,137
 Good morning! Hello.

771
00:58:47,137 --> 00:58:49,347
 We're going to plant this today.

772
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:53,927
 By chance, there isn't anything I don't know about, right?

773
00:58:53,927 --> 00:58:57,547
 Great job today, Honey.
