 Battle For Happiness

10
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,060
 This is a work of fiction. Characters, locations, agencies, incidents, organizations, and jobs have no relation to real life.

11
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,690
 The filming of child actors was conducted safely with consultation from experts and with their guardian's consent.

12
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,140

I can't be sure of it, either.

13
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,550
 But based on the timing and circumstance,

14
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,920
 if she's not Yu Jin's child, who could it be?

15
00:00:58,314 --> 00:00:59,884
 Hey, what are you doing right now!

16
00:00:59,884 --> 00:01:02,734
 Are they the only ones who are your kids? You're my mom too.

17
00:01:02,734 --> 00:01:06,224
 So why are you only living with them? What about me?

18
00:01:06,224 --> 00:01:11,504
 That child posted on her social media that she sold her body for favors in order to gain attention.

19
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:16,034
 I think Kang Do Joon used that to approach Ju Ah.

20
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:19,324
 And I think Yu Jin found out about it.

21
00:01:19,324 --> 00:01:22,074
 She went out of her way to purchase the apartment that was way too much for her.

22
00:01:22,074 --> 00:01:23,844
 Even paying interest on top of repaying principal in installments.

23
00:01:23,844 --> 00:01:27,544
 She must have had to fork over tens of millions won each month to the bank.

24
00:01:27,544 --> 00:01:32,464
 Yu Jin was the one who hired someone to kill Kang Do Joon.

25
00:01:32,464 --> 00:01:34,764
 Kang Do Joon thinks I have it.

26
00:01:34,764 --> 00:01:35,994
 I used that

27
00:01:35,994 --> 00:01:37,774
 to threaten Kang Do Joon.

28
00:01:37,774 --> 00:01:41,804
 USB. The USB that contains that murder request information.

29
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:50,760

30
00:01:53,924 --> 00:01:56,694
 Kang Do Joon thinks that I have it.

31
00:01:58,684 --> 00:02:00,574
 I used that

32
00:02:00,574 --> 00:02:02,714
to threaten him.

33
00:02:02,714 --> 00:02:05,744
So I'm asking you, what is it!

34
00:02:12,294 --> 00:02:15,884
If I tell you,

35
00:02:17,414 --> 00:02:23,854
can you testify that I was an eyewitness and not an accomplice?

36
00:02:23,854 --> 00:02:25,254
Tell me.

37
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:28,084
USB.

38
00:02:33,464 --> 00:02:37,934
Yu Jin was the one who hired someone to kill Kang Do Joon.

39
00:02:41,574 --> 00:02:44,644
 The USB that contains that murder request information.

40
00:02:53,274 --> 00:02:56,984
 You probably won't believe me, but it's true.

41
00:02:56,984 --> 00:03:01,614
 On that USB, she gathered the weaknesses of other moms and blackmailed them.

42
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:04,734
 She shouldn't be doing that.

43
00:03:04,734 --> 00:03:06,614
 So? What do you want me to do?

44
00:03:06,614 --> 00:03:11,654
 You can steal that USB, right?

45
00:03:11,654 --> 00:03:13,374
 Why would I do that?

46
00:03:13,374 --> 00:03:15,484
 How would you know where that is?

47
00:03:15,484 --> 00:03:16,614
 I'm telling you, I saw it.

48
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:22,604
 I saw Ji Yool's mom put that USB in that locker with a sketchbook.

49
00:03:22,604 --> 00:03:26,154
 I suppose that one was a black and long one—

50
00:03:26,154 --> 00:03:27,814
 Wait. .

51
00:03:27,814 --> 00:03:29,584
 A black one?

52
00:03:32,624 --> 00:03:35,384
 200 million won for getting rid of someone is chump change.

53
00:03:35,384 --> 00:03:37,384
 You said December 10th?

54
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,214
 Yes.

55
00:03:39,214 --> 00:03:41,014
 He'll arrive in Cebu the day before.

56
00:03:41,014 --> 00:03:46,354
 Then, with this recording, the deal involving Kang Do Joon is set.

57
00:03:50,724 --> 00:03:51,734
 Recording - Pause

58
00:03:53,504 --> 00:03:54,944
 Let's do a trade.

59
00:03:54,944 --> 00:03:57,444
 Bring me that black USB from that locker.

60
00:03:57,444 --> 00:04:01,814
 Then I will find that silver USB somehow and give it to you.

61
00:04:24,054 --> 00:04:26,064
 What the...

62
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:30,384
 Did he strike first?

63
00:04:30,384 --> 00:04:35,344
 December 5th, 2022. The day of Oh Yu Jin's death

64
00:04:55,354 --> 00:04:56,554
 What if someone sees you!

65
00:04:56,554 --> 00:04:58,734
 I came because it was urgent. That locker...

66
00:04:58,734 --> 00:05:00,584
 What about the USB?

67
00:05:00,584 --> 00:05:02,044
 The black one.

68
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:05,354
 I asked if you brought it.

69
00:05:06,614 --> 00:05:08,384
 I did manage to smuggle it away.

70
00:05:08,384 --> 00:05:09,874
 But I didn't bring it with me.

71
00:05:09,874 --> 00:05:11,874
 Give me the silver USB first.

72
00:05:11,874 --> 00:05:13,774
 That was the condition for the trade.

73
00:05:32,204 --> 00:05:34,164
 ooo_yoojin has just posted a photo.

74
00:05:36,274 --> 00:05:38,574
 It's a date night for just the two of us tonight.

75
00:05:38,574 --> 00:05:40,474
 Kids are away at an overnight camp,

76
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:43,474
 and we plan for a cozy night together.

77
00:06:18,074 --> 00:06:20,584
 Now, tell me.

78
00:06:20,584 --> 00:06:23,744
 How are you planning on killing me?

79
00:06:24,604 --> 00:06:26,654
 Stop speaking such nonsense!

80
00:06:26,654 --> 00:06:28,784
 You think I don't know? Tell me the truth!

81
00:06:28,784 --> 00:06:31,284
 What are you saying! Please come to your senses!

82
00:06:31,284 --> 00:06:34,194
 - I feel like I'll go crazier than you!
 - Why would you?

83
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:37,654
 - Please stop it!
 - I feel like I'll go crazy because of you!

84
00:06:37,654 --> 00:06:39,354
 Jang Mi Ho

85
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,704
 You disgust me.

86
00:06:51,704 --> 00:06:54,414
 I wish you would just die.

87
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:02,394
 Damn it!

88
00:07:02,394 --> 00:07:04,004
 You're just reaping what you sowed.

89
00:07:04,004 --> 00:07:05,554
 You dirty bastard!

90
00:07:05,554 --> 00:07:08,384
 How could you do that to Ju Ah?

91
00:07:08,384 --> 00:07:10,954
 To Ju Ah!

92
00:07:10,954 --> 00:07:12,524
 You're a piece of trash!

93
00:07:12,524 --> 00:07:13,704
 You're worse than a dog!

94
00:07:13,704 --> 00:07:16,864
 Damn it! You're the one who is a piece of trash!

95
00:07:16,864 --> 00:07:20,634
 You thought I wouldn't know that you hired someone to kill me?

96
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,874
Yu Jin

97
00:07:31,874 --> 00:07:34,574
hired someone to kill him?

98
00:07:34,574 --> 00:07:36,554
That day,

99
00:07:36,554 --> 00:07:40,414
from what I heard, I think it was because of a child named Ju Ah.

100
00:07:40,414 --> 00:07:42,284
Yu Jin blew up,

101
00:07:42,284 --> 00:07:46,634
asking how he could do that to Ju Ah.

102
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:48,214
 - Let go!
 - Where do you think you're going?

103
00:07:48,214 --> 00:07:49,894
 Get over here!

104
00:07:49,894 --> 00:07:51,424
 You!

105
00:07:59,844 --> 00:08:01,814
D-Did...

106
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,894
Did Yu Jin

107
00:08:03,894 --> 00:08:06,834
really try to kill Kang Do Joon?

108
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:18,384
God. Okay, if that's true,

109
00:08:29,944 --> 00:08:32,834
why did Yu Jin die that day?

110
00:08:32,834 --> 00:08:35,614
What happened?

111
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:46,654
Th-That black U-USB.

112
00:08:54,894 --> 00:08:57,724
 If you tell her that right now,

113
00:08:57,724 --> 00:08:59,704
 your daughter will die.

114
00:09:07,344 --> 00:09:11,124
What else was in that black USB?

115
00:09:15,204 --> 00:09:16,804
Nothing.

116
00:09:18,714 --> 00:09:19,914
Nothing's there.

117
00:09:19,914 --> 00:09:23,784
Why are you doing this? You were just about to say something!

118
00:09:23,784 --> 00:09:25,574
Now, leave.

119
00:09:25,574 --> 00:09:26,954
Now, go.

120
00:09:26,954 --> 00:09:29,744
Deputy Manager, that message just now was from Kang Do Joon, right?

121
00:09:29,744 --> 00:09:30,914
Don't you hear me telling you to leave?

122
00:09:30,914 --> 00:09:32,644
- Deputy Manager!
 - Just leave!

123
00:09:32,644 --> 00:09:33,834
Come on, Deputy Manager!

124
00:09:33,834 --> 00:09:35,524
Please just leave now!

125
00:09:35,524 --> 00:09:38,104
Deputy Manager, wait! Deputy Manger.

126
00:09:38,104 --> 00:09:40,484
Come on, please just go home!

127
00:09:40,484 --> 00:09:42,094
Deputy Manager!

128
00:09:42,094 --> 00:09:44,354
Ms. Hwang!

129
00:09:44,354 --> 00:09:46,494
Deputy Manager, open the door!

130
00:09:47,784 --> 00:09:50,474
 What else was there?

131
00:09:50,474 --> 00:09:53,654
 Deputy Manager! Deputy Manager!

132
00:09:57,604 --> 00:09:58,624
 The USB.

133
00:09:58,624 --> 00:10:01,364
 Kang Do Joon thinks that I have it.

134
00:10:03,734 --> 00:10:07,574
 Episode 15

135
00:10:21,574 --> 00:10:22,844
I mean it.

136
00:10:22,844 --> 00:10:26,114
I'm doing this because it's a document I need to run the clinic.

137
00:10:26,114 --> 00:10:29,374
You're really not doing something worthless, right?

138
00:10:29,374 --> 00:10:31,214
Everything will be resolved once I find this.

139
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:34,384
I will be going back home soon, so don't worry too much.

140
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,344
Please hurry it up a bit.

141
00:10:55,164 --> 00:10:57,624
Where is it?

142
00:11:00,194 --> 00:11:02,484
It's not here. Let's withdraw.

143
00:11:02,484 --> 00:11:04,204
Put all of this back.

144
00:11:11,164 --> 00:11:13,094
Kids, pay attention in class.

145
00:11:13,094 --> 00:11:14,754
 Okay.

146
00:11:14,754 --> 00:11:16,694
Okay.

147
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,604
Take this.

148
00:11:45,244 --> 00:11:48,014
It's a lawsuit filing for compensation from the husband's mistress.

149
00:11:48,014 --> 00:11:50,384
I sent it to your house, but it kept getting returned.

150
00:11:50,384 --> 00:11:53,784
Change your job again and again.

151
00:11:53,784 --> 00:11:57,354
Every time you do, I will come to see you like this with a lawsuit I've filed

152
00:11:57,354 --> 00:12:00,314
for compensation from the husband's mistress.

153
00:12:00,314 --> 00:12:02,114
Have a good day.

154
00:12:14,394 --> 00:12:16,364
You don't have to go this far.

155
00:12:16,364 --> 00:12:19,864
I thought I was pregnant, but it turned out I wasn't. Okay?

156
00:12:25,314 --> 00:12:27,274
You knew about it?

157
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:31,894
Even if I get divorced, I won't ever marry someone so wicked like you!

158
00:12:31,894 --> 00:12:35,154
Then you'll end up as a single mom with no support, you know that?

159
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:36,944
 Single mom?

160
00:12:37,794 --> 00:12:38,884
 You're quite naive.

161
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:40,414
 What do you mean by that?

162
00:12:40,414 --> 00:12:42,564
 I asked what you mean by that!

163
00:12:44,324 --> 00:12:46,054
Then why are you being like this?

164
00:12:46,054 --> 00:12:48,024
Aren't you pregnant right now, Ah Rin's mother?

165
00:12:48,024 --> 00:12:49,964
Then you can just live happily with him and not get divorced!

166
00:12:49,964 --> 00:12:51,544
How dare you say—

167
00:12:54,924 --> 00:12:57,284
How dare you say something like that?

168
00:12:58,254 --> 00:13:04,114
For the rest of your life, I'll help you come to realize

169
00:13:04,114 --> 00:13:08,214
what you have done, so look forward to it.

170
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:15,564
Oh, and make sure you meet a good guy and get married...

171
00:13:18,394 --> 00:13:20,774
so I can destroy your marriage.

172
00:13:23,484 --> 00:13:25,604
Hey, what makes you think you're all that?

173
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:27,644
Lee Tae Ho said you were really not that great.

174
00:13:27,644 --> 00:13:30,524
He said he's never loved you!

175
00:13:34,904 --> 00:13:37,084
In the end, you're just a divorced woman!

176
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:39,824
You think you'll live happily as a single mom of two?

177
00:13:49,784 --> 00:13:51,874
 Representative Attorney Jeong Hae Dam

178
00:13:53,134 --> 00:13:54,744
 Letter of Complaint

179
00:13:54,744 --> 00:13:57,844
 Content of Complaint

180
00:14:05,974 --> 00:14:07,954
 Aren't you pregnant right now, Ah Rin's mother?

181
00:14:07,954 --> 00:14:11,014
 Then you can just live happily with him and not get divorced!

182
00:14:43,644 --> 00:14:44,934
 Pregnancy Diary

183
00:14:53,714 --> 00:14:55,424
Hey, Eonni—

184
00:14:58,624 --> 00:15:01,914
Do you want to have a cup of tea together?

185
00:15:01,914 --> 00:15:06,634
I saw from doing some research that there was something called attorney ethics.

186
00:15:06,634 --> 00:15:09,444
That guy legally represented Jang Mi Ho in Yu Jin's case,

187
00:15:09,444 --> 00:15:12,334
and is now providing consultation for Kang Do Joon.

188
00:15:12,334 --> 00:15:14,424
We must have him disciplined for this, somehow.

189
00:15:14,424 --> 00:15:17,724
I'm sure Jang Mi Ho will testify for us.

190
00:15:19,774 --> 00:15:22,954
Things will be difficult for you with just child support.

191
00:15:22,954 --> 00:15:24,434
Are you thinking about working?

192
00:15:24,434 --> 00:15:28,624
Yes. I don't want to depend on my dad again.

193
00:15:33,244 --> 00:15:36,014
How about you work at my company?

194
00:15:37,014 --> 00:15:39,584
- Pardon?
 - It's a job that can be done remotely,

195
00:15:39,584 --> 00:15:42,584
and it won't be difficult to learn the job.

196
00:15:42,584 --> 00:15:45,984
You've worked at a related job before you got married, anyway.

197
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:49,824
You're not looking for new employees?

198
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,294
I am.

199
00:15:51,294 --> 00:15:54,664
I just haven't found someone who fits the bill.

200
00:15:54,664 --> 00:15:57,194
But why me, of all people?

201
00:15:57,194 --> 00:16:00,974
It's not like things have always been great between you and me, Eonni.

202
00:16:03,314 --> 00:16:08,564
Right now, I need someone who has been by my side.

203
00:16:08,564 --> 00:16:11,174
Even if that is me?

204
00:16:11,174 --> 00:16:13,384
Think about it. I'll await your response.

205
00:16:13,384 --> 00:16:15,144
I'll do it.

206
00:16:15,144 --> 00:16:19,184
If you're okay that it's me, then I want to do it.

207
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:29,244
 I am not an adulteress but a victim who is unfairly blamed.

208
00:16:29,244 --> 00:16:34,244
 Hello, I am Jo Ah Ra, the one known as the adulteress of Attorney Lee Tae Ho of Boolhwi Law Firm.

209
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:35,754
 This is so unfair to me.

210
00:16:35,754 --> 00:16:38,024
 Since I am not an adulteress but a victim.

211
00:16:38,024 --> 00:16:42,154
 When we first met, Lee Tae Ho said he came to pick up his niece.

212
00:16:42,154 --> 00:16:44,094
 However, it turned out that it wasn't his niece but his daughter.

213
00:16:44,094 --> 00:16:45,064
 Director Kang Do Joon

214
00:16:49,974 --> 00:16:51,354
Yes?

215
00:16:52,474 --> 00:16:54,624
 Let's meet for a moment.

216
00:16:54,624 --> 00:16:56,464
I'm not in a situation where I can do that.

217
00:16:56,464 --> 00:16:58,454
Hey.

218
00:16:58,454 --> 00:17:00,704
It appears you've been kicked out because you got caught cheating,

219
00:17:00,704 --> 00:17:03,254
but shouldn't you still try to figure out a way to survive?

220
00:17:03,254 --> 00:17:07,174
Also, you do know that you've broken attorney regulations, right?

221
00:17:07,174 --> 00:17:09,264
If you ignore me one more time,

222
00:17:09,264 --> 00:17:11,344
it won't end with you no longer being able to practice law.

223
00:17:11,344 --> 00:17:15,034
What? What did you say? Hello? Hey—

224
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,254
Gosh, seriously!

225
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:37,914
I've been played a fool by that woman, Hwang Ji Hye.

226
00:17:37,914 --> 00:17:39,794
If that's the case,

227
00:17:41,864 --> 00:17:45,514
then I'm sure Yu Jin took back that USB.

228
00:17:45,514 --> 00:17:47,784
But I can't figure out where it is.

229
00:17:47,784 --> 00:17:49,774
Have you searched everywhere?

230
00:17:50,774 --> 00:17:54,044
Seeing how everything is quiet, the police don't have it.

231
00:17:54,044 --> 00:17:55,944
And I had searched the house a long time ago.

232
00:17:55,944 --> 00:17:58,484
And I've checked the box filled with the deceased's belongings and the locker.

233
00:17:59,934 --> 00:18:02,144
I've looked everywhere

234
00:18:02,144 --> 00:18:03,874
but I can't find it.

235
00:18:04,764 --> 00:18:09,534
Seeing how I can't find it, though I've looked everywhere like this,

236
00:18:09,534 --> 00:18:12,824
it means she may have gotten rid of it.

237
00:18:14,324 --> 00:18:17,564
Do you really think Oh Yu Jin would have gotten rid of it?

238
00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:23,454
You're too calm.

239
00:18:23,454 --> 00:18:26,114
The way those women work is by gathering evidence secretly

240
00:18:26,114 --> 00:18:29,224
and striking you with all of it at once when you least expect it.

241
00:18:29,224 --> 00:18:32,474
I told you I've checked everywhere, damn it.

242
00:18:32,474 --> 00:18:37,134
Then, is there anyone else who might know about the USB apart from Hwang Ji Hye?

243
00:18:37,134 --> 00:18:39,544
Someone else may have seen it.

244
00:18:45,704 --> 00:18:50,284
Let's see what my daughter is drawing.

245
00:18:57,534 --> 00:19:00,814
 Do you know that Ji Yool watched the video?

246
00:19:04,314 --> 00:19:06,174
Let me borrow your car. Where did you park it?

247
00:19:06,174 --> 00:19:08,904
- Why?
 - I asked where you parked it!

248
00:19:11,054 --> 00:19:14,074
I parked it near the entrance on the basement level 4.

249
00:19:39,224 --> 00:19:42,454
 Birthmark Teacher

250
00:19:44,174 --> 00:19:45,594
 Yes, Ji Yool's father.

251
00:19:45,594 --> 00:19:48,164
Hello, Miss. Thank you for your hard work.

252
00:19:48,164 --> 00:19:50,004
My kids...

253
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,364
Ji Yool is at the kindergarten, right?

254
00:19:52,364 --> 00:19:53,924
A black USB.

255
00:19:53,924 --> 00:19:56,224
I was wondering if it was among the items that the police took.

256
00:19:56,224 --> 00:19:57,844
 I don't think so.

257
00:19:57,844 --> 00:19:59,554
 I'll check.

258
00:19:59,554 --> 00:20:02,624
 But what is this about?

259
00:20:02,624 --> 00:20:06,014
I just felt like it was relevant.

260
00:20:07,734 --> 00:20:09,454
 Herinity Kindergarten Assistant Teacher Park Chae Ri

261
00:20:11,734 --> 00:20:14,824
Detective, I'll call you right back.

262
00:20:14,824 --> 00:20:17,364
- Yes, Teacher.
  - Hello, Ji Yool's aunt.

263
00:20:17,364 --> 00:20:19,704
 It's just that...

264
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,034
Daddy, where are we going?

265
00:20:23,034 --> 00:20:24,174
We're going home, right?

266
00:20:24,174 --> 00:20:26,074
Yeah, just a second.

267
00:20:27,494 --> 00:20:30,934
 Ji Yool's father just took the kids not too long ago.

268
00:20:30,934 --> 00:20:32,244
What!

269
00:20:32,244 --> 00:20:34,794
 I wasn't going to say anything, but I called you just in case.

270
00:20:34,794 --> 00:20:38,414
No, you can't send the kids with him!

271
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:41,414
Where did he take them?

272
00:20:46,764 --> 00:20:50,034
Should we sit here for a bit before we go?

273
00:20:58,514 --> 00:21:00,474
All right, Ji Yool, you sit here, too.

274
00:21:03,094 --> 00:21:06,194
Ji Yool, have you ever seen that before?

275
00:21:06,194 --> 00:21:07,464
What are you talking about?

276
00:21:07,464 --> 00:21:10,354
Daddy, let's go home quickly.

277
00:21:10,354 --> 00:21:12,294
You know...

278
00:21:15,254 --> 00:21:16,624
Let's go.

279
00:21:22,234 --> 00:21:24,954
Daddy, let's go home.

280
00:21:24,954 --> 00:21:26,614
Yeah, we should.

281
00:21:26,614 --> 00:21:30,354
Before we go home, buy me toys. And cards, too!

282
00:21:30,354 --> 00:21:32,644
All right. Okay.

283
00:21:57,714 --> 00:21:59,464
Mi Ho!

284
00:22:09,744 --> 00:22:11,744
Didn't Jang Mi Ho go back to work?

285
00:22:11,744 --> 00:22:13,134
You're right. At this hour...

286
00:22:13,134 --> 00:22:15,024
Well, that works out for us. You should ask her.

287
00:22:15,024 --> 00:22:17,814
You said you wanted to get your husband to face discipline.

288
00:22:19,074 --> 00:22:21,734
Min Seong supposedly has golden cards, too.

289
00:22:21,734 --> 00:22:24,384
Really? How many?

290
00:22:27,834 --> 00:22:30,214
Ha Yool, you continue playing.

291
00:22:30,214 --> 00:22:32,834
Ji Yool, let's have a little talk with Daddy.

292
00:22:39,564 --> 00:22:42,994
 I told the kid's aunt that you took the kids.

293
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:47,974
 Next time, please come to an agreement between the two of you beforehand.

294
00:22:47,974 --> 00:22:50,044
Damn it.

295
00:22:55,664 --> 00:22:59,244
Ji Yool, you know what a USB is, right?

296
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:03,054
Didn't Mommy have a black USB?

297
00:23:18,084 --> 00:23:19,914
It's Auntie!

298
00:23:19,914 --> 00:23:21,444
Ha Yool.

299
00:23:26,544 --> 00:23:28,714
Ha Yool, you stay here for a little bit.

300
00:23:31,154 --> 00:23:32,744
What are you doing with the kids?

301
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:33,784
Mind your own business.

302
00:23:33,784 --> 00:23:36,154
I don't know what you're plotting, but leave the kids out of it!

303
00:23:36,154 --> 00:23:37,514
Damn you!

304
00:23:37,514 --> 00:23:40,284
Who are you to tell me what I shouldn't do!

305
00:23:44,634 --> 00:23:45,834
Let's talk somewhere else.

306
00:23:45,834 --> 00:23:47,494
I have nothing to say to you.

307
00:23:47,494 --> 00:23:49,594
Come here!

308
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,114
Ha Yool, you come, too.

309
00:23:51,114 --> 00:23:54,234
Let go of them. They're getting scared, so leave them out of it.

310
00:23:54,234 --> 00:23:55,914
You're not going to move?

311
00:23:55,914 --> 00:23:57,874
I get it, so please just let go of them!

312
00:23:57,874 --> 00:23:59,454
Move!

313
00:23:59,454 --> 00:24:01,434
Come!

314
00:24:03,434 --> 00:24:05,384
Damn it...

315
00:24:12,894 --> 00:24:15,014
Come here.

316
00:24:15,014 --> 00:24:17,744
I'm sorry, but please watch the kids for a bit.

317
00:24:23,744 --> 00:24:25,564
Let go.

318
00:24:31,154 --> 00:24:32,954
Let's go inside.

319
00:24:38,084 --> 00:24:40,114
Are you okay?

320
00:24:47,214 --> 00:24:48,794
Who do you think you are?

321
00:24:50,454 --> 00:24:52,324
I'm their father.

322
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,694
I am asking what right you have to be doing this!

323
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:58,904
How could someone who mistreats his children like that be a father?

324
00:24:58,904 --> 00:25:00,934
You're trying to take them away because you're plotting something!

325
00:25:00,934 --> 00:25:04,814
Damn you! Who are you to talk about whether I deserve to be their dad?

326
00:25:04,814 --> 00:25:06,744
Are you looking down on me?

327
00:25:08,814 --> 00:25:11,064
She'll be fine, right?

328
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,064
No.

329
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:16,884
Go inside with the kids first.

330
00:25:16,884 --> 00:25:18,494
I'll come back after I check up on her.

331
00:25:18,494 --> 00:25:20,464
Okay. Let's go.

332
00:25:26,104 --> 00:25:28,934
You think I will give up if you threaten me like this, don't you?

333
00:25:28,934 --> 00:25:31,604
But I'm not at all scared of someone like you.

334
00:25:31,604 --> 00:25:33,814
All you know how to do is something like this.

335
00:25:33,814 --> 00:25:36,074
Shut up!

336
00:25:36,074 --> 00:25:38,594
Damn you!

337
00:25:38,594 --> 00:25:43,274
At this rate, I may really kill you!

338
00:25:44,274 --> 00:25:46,824
You were like this to Yu Jin, too, right?

339
00:25:46,824 --> 00:25:49,274
You worthless bastard.

340
00:25:49,274 --> 00:25:52,594
You think someone so pathetic like you will scare me?

341
00:26:14,644 --> 00:26:16,144
Why do you look down on me?

342
00:26:16,144 --> 00:26:21,564
Why? Why? Why! Why!

343
00:26:36,124 --> 00:26:38,534
 Die!

344
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:45,984
Mi Ho! Mi Ho! Mi Ho!

345
00:26:51,164 --> 00:26:52,874
Are you okay?

346
00:26:56,004 --> 00:26:58,624
D-Don't go...

347
00:27:00,684 --> 00:27:04,664
 I will make this into a fragrant dessert cafe!

348
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:08,054
 Cherry is full of energy today.

349
00:27:08,054 --> 00:27:11,524
 She looks about ready to destroy the cafe.

350
00:27:17,414 --> 00:27:20,054
How could his eyes flip like that in an instant?

351
00:27:20,054 --> 00:27:22,564
You saw how he was treating the kids, right?

352
00:27:22,564 --> 00:27:24,054
Be careful.

353
00:27:24,054 --> 00:27:26,334
I feel like something will really happen.

354
00:27:27,594 --> 00:27:30,554
Since it's already so late, let's have the kids sleep over here,

355
00:27:30,554 --> 00:27:33,544
and let's go to the police station together after dropping off the kids at the kindergarten.

356
00:27:33,544 --> 00:27:35,964
I don't think we should just let things be.

357
00:27:41,014 --> 00:27:43,174
Auntie.

358
00:27:43,174 --> 00:27:45,304
I need to use the bathroom.

359
00:27:57,374 --> 00:27:59,424
You got scared, right?

360
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:03,284
I'm sorry.

361
00:28:04,614 --> 00:28:06,704
What about Daddy?

362
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:11,634
Daddy is...

363
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:16,834
When Daddy bought us toys,

364
00:28:16,834 --> 00:28:20,404
he said you weren't our real aunt.

365
00:28:20,404 --> 00:28:24,294
Auntie, are you not our real aunt?

366
00:28:25,494 --> 00:28:29,094
That's not true. Auntie is your real aunt.

367
00:28:31,424 --> 00:28:34,544
But what else did Daddy say to you?

368
00:28:34,544 --> 00:28:40,564
He said since we are family, we have to stick together.

369
00:28:42,184 --> 00:28:44,954
And he asked me about that, too.

370
00:28:44,954 --> 00:28:49,514
The USB that Mom always got sad while looking at.

371
00:28:49,514 --> 00:28:52,294
The shiny jewel USB?

372
00:28:52,294 --> 00:28:55,074
No, not that one.

373
00:28:55,074 --> 00:28:57,974
The black stick-shaped one.

374
00:29:01,084 --> 00:29:03,504
What did Daddy ask you?

375
00:29:03,504 --> 00:29:07,094
Ji Yool, you know what a USB is, right?

376
00:29:07,094 --> 00:29:10,854
Didn't Mommy have a black USB?

377
00:29:13,484 --> 00:29:16,274
You remember when you went on the kindergarten camping trip, right?

378
00:29:16,274 --> 00:29:19,604
Did you see that USB that day, too?

379
00:29:23,494 --> 00:29:24,914
Kang Ji Yool!

380
00:29:24,914 --> 00:29:29,124
You think Daddy doesn't know that you always look through Mommy's stuff?

381
00:29:29,124 --> 00:29:34,144
I saw that it was in the master bedroom drawers.

382
00:30:17,444 --> 00:30:20,334
So that's what she was looking for.

383
00:30:26,104 --> 00:30:29,784
Was there really a black USB in the master bedroom drawers?

384
00:30:33,294 --> 00:30:35,564
Thank you. Let's go.

385
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:38,354
I'm going to drop by Yu Jin's place for a bit.

386
00:30:38,354 --> 00:30:40,094
Could you watch the kids?

387
00:30:40,094 --> 00:30:42,644
What's wrong?

388
00:30:42,644 --> 00:30:44,344
I need to check something.

389
00:30:44,344 --> 00:30:46,034
I'll be back.

390
00:31:00,684 --> 00:31:03,624
 It was definitely not in the house.

391
00:31:40,884 --> 00:31:42,054
 Come here!

392
00:31:42,054 --> 00:31:44,284
 Come here!

393
00:31:44,284 --> 00:31:46,524
 I heard they fought.

394
00:32:24,194 --> 00:32:26,074
 And then...

395
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:30,074
 After that, she went to the kids' room.

396
00:35:31,194 --> 00:35:33,884
 And finally, to the balcony.

397
00:36:01,454 --> 00:36:04,604
 You said that Yu Jin's cause of death was excessive bleeding, right?

398
00:36:04,604 --> 00:36:08,744
 If 911 was called right away, could she have survived?

399
00:36:10,154 --> 00:36:11,554
 Probably.

400
00:36:11,554 --> 00:36:15,044
 I wonder what was more important to her than life or death.

401
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,700
 Call

402
00:36:53,504 --> 00:36:56,404
 What? You have something more to say?

403
00:36:56,404 --> 00:36:59,204
 I left as you told me to.

404
00:36:59,204 --> 00:37:01,094
 Help me...

405
00:37:02,364 --> 00:37:06,104
 You... know... the number...

406
00:37:14,564 --> 00:37:16,324
 Hey, Oh Yu Jin...

407
00:37:18,334 --> 00:37:20,564
 Yu Jin, Oh Yu Jin.

408
00:37:20,564 --> 00:37:22,384
 Is something the matter?

409
00:37:22,384 --> 00:37:24,484
 Help me...

410
00:37:26,474 --> 00:37:29,094
 You... know... the number...

411
00:38:38,014 --> 00:38:42,254
 What Yu Jin wanted to hide even with her life

412
00:38:42,254 --> 00:38:44,394
 was her true happiness.

413
00:38:46,694 --> 00:38:49,544
 What she wanted to protect even with her life

414
00:38:51,374 --> 00:38:53,304
 was fake happiness.

415
00:42:31,964 --> 00:42:34,984
 200 million won for getting rid of someone is chump change.

416
00:42:34,984 --> 00:42:37,534
You said December 10th?

417
00:42:37,534 --> 00:42:38,944
Yes.

418
00:42:40,794 --> 00:42:43,664
He'll arrive in Cebu the day before.

419
00:42:43,664 --> 00:42:44,944
Then, with this recording,

420
00:42:44,944 --> 00:42:48,874
 the deal involving Kang Do Joon is set.

421
00:42:50,844 --> 00:42:54,164
 No! No.

422
00:42:54,164 --> 00:42:56,054
 No, I don't want to do it.

423
00:42:56,054 --> 00:42:57,444
 Pardon?

424
00:42:58,594 --> 00:43:01,254
 I must have lost my mind for a moment.

425
00:43:01,254 --> 00:43:03,084
 I must have gone crazy.

426
00:43:03,084 --> 00:43:06,164
I won't do it. I don't want it.

427
00:43:08,304 --> 00:43:11,154
What am I doing right now...

428
00:43:15,034 --> 00:43:20,354
Gosh, gosh, I just felt like I would go crazy.

429
00:43:20,354 --> 00:43:23,884
I won't do it. I don't want it.

430
00:43:25,364 --> 00:43:27,634
I don't want it, no...

431
00:43:41,504 --> 00:43:43,504
 He'll arrive in Cebu the day before.

432
00:43:43,504 --> 00:43:48,594
 Then, with this recording, the deal involving Kang Do Joon is set.

433
00:43:50,224 --> 00:43:52,034
What is the reason you're playing this for me?

434
00:43:52,034 --> 00:43:54,894
 I thought you should know.

435
00:43:54,894 --> 00:43:58,804
 That your wife is capable of doing this.

436
00:44:00,534 --> 00:44:02,504
 So...

437
00:44:02,504 --> 00:44:04,684
 should I just let her be?

438
00:44:06,204 --> 00:44:07,934
All right, then.

439
00:44:09,384 --> 00:44:11,294
Why don't you kill her for me then?

440
00:44:17,334 --> 00:44:20,504
Damn it! You're the one who is a piece of trash!

441
00:44:20,504 --> 00:44:23,314
You thought I wouldn't know that you hired someone to kill me?

442
00:44:23,314 --> 00:44:24,884
Then what about you?

443
00:44:24,884 --> 00:44:29,094
You think that hitman wouldn't have told on you to me?

444
00:44:30,384 --> 00:44:33,684
You bastard, you don't even have the guts to kill me yourself.

445
00:44:33,684 --> 00:44:37,604
Die! I'll kill you, damn it!

446
00:44:37,604 --> 00:44:38,974
Let go!

447
00:44:38,974 --> 00:44:42,564
Come here! Come here!

448
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:09,570
 Associate Manager Lee Jin Seop

449
00:45:14,524 --> 00:45:16,914
 Why is it so hard to get in touch with you?

450
00:45:22,044 --> 00:45:23,194
 Is something the matter?

451
00:45:23,194 --> 00:45:24,954
Jin Seop...

452
00:45:26,684 --> 00:45:28,254
 I'll be right there.

453
00:45:30,184 --> 00:45:31,534
Okay.

454
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:56,364
Isn't Mi Ho taking too long?

455
00:46:03,574 --> 00:46:05,574
 Select photos and audio folders

456
00:46:08,204 --> 00:46:09,364
 Copy here

457
00:46:09,364 --> 00:46:10,234
 Kang Do Joon

458
00:46:19,824 --> 00:46:24,724
 Kang Do Joon

459
00:46:26,894 --> 00:46:30,024
 I'm sorry about what happened earlier.

460
00:46:30,024 --> 00:46:32,314
 I got a bit excessively emotional.

461
00:46:36,164 --> 00:46:41,254
 The thing is, I have a kid named Ju Ah with me.

462
00:46:41,254 --> 00:46:42,904
Don't mess around.

463
00:46:42,904 --> 00:46:44,454
What are you plotting this time?

464
00:46:44,454 --> 00:46:46,714
 I'm at the parking lot in underground level three.

465
00:46:48,454 --> 00:46:51,304
 Kang Do Joon

466
00:47:04,274 --> 00:47:08,324
Ju Ah! Ju Ah!

467
00:47:08,324 --> 00:47:10,094
Ju Ah!

468
00:47:15,894 --> 00:47:18,854
 Detective, come to the underground parking lot in the apartment building

469
00:47:25,874 --> 00:47:27,704
Where is Ju Ah?

470
00:47:28,814 --> 00:47:30,674
Where is she!

471
00:47:33,304 --> 00:47:36,144
I temporarily put her under someone else's charge.

472
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:38,414
- Where?
 - Come with me

473
00:47:38,414 --> 00:47:40,604
and let's talk.

474
00:47:49,634 --> 00:47:51,284
Why are you doing this?

475
00:47:55,524 --> 00:47:57,254
USB.

476
00:48:47,714 --> 00:48:50,724
 The phone is turned off. You'll be connected to the voicemail.

477
00:48:50,724 --> 00:48:53,054
 After the beep, and there will be an additional charge.

478
00:48:53,054 --> 00:48:54,964
Is it still turned off?

479
00:48:54,964 --> 00:48:56,464
Yeah.

480
00:48:58,494 --> 00:49:00,014
Did you find her?

481
00:49:00,994 --> 00:49:05,104
I went to the management office, the underground parking lot, and the personal garage, but she wasn't there.

482
00:49:05,104 --> 00:49:06,824
Shouldn't we report it to the police?

483
00:49:06,824 --> 00:49:09,244
It hasn't been that long since you've lost contact with her.

484
00:49:09,244 --> 00:49:11,224
You sure we're worrying over nothing?

485
00:49:11,224 --> 00:49:13,714
 Die!

486
00:49:18,154 --> 00:49:21,404
No, I think something happened.

487
00:49:21,404 --> 00:49:24,354
Let's go check the CCTVs at the management office.

488
00:49:41,514 --> 00:49:43,414
Isn't this a kidnapping?

489
00:49:43,414 --> 00:49:45,834
The police station, the police station.

490
00:49:47,444 --> 00:49:49,914
-  The phone is turned off... 
 - Why isn't she picking up?

491
00:49:49,914 --> 00:49:53,254
Excuse me.

492
00:49:55,384 --> 00:49:58,054
Did you come to meet Jang Mi Ho?

493
00:49:58,054 --> 00:49:59,524
- Oh, yes.
 - Where does she say she is?

494
00:49:59,524 --> 00:50:01,214
Were you able to get in contact with her?

495
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:06,244
Officer, I know how this picture seems.

496
00:50:06,244 --> 00:50:08,394
But you shouldn't make a judgment call from just this picture alone.

497
00:50:08,394 --> 00:50:11,874
This person is the husband and suspect in the Bannae-dong couple murder case,

498
00:50:11,874 --> 00:50:14,804
and Mi Ho kept digging up what this husband had done.

499
00:50:14,804 --> 00:50:16,604
It may really be a kidnapping.

500
00:50:16,604 --> 00:50:18,744
There was even a time he choked and assaulted her,

501
00:50:18,744 --> 00:50:20,344
so what more wouldn't he be capable of?

502
00:50:20,344 --> 00:50:23,924
I don't think it's something for us to determine so quickly.

503
00:50:25,104 --> 00:50:26,324
If you're going to report it,

504
00:50:26,324 --> 00:50:29,494
fill out her visual description, last destination, and a summary of the incident,

505
00:50:29,494 --> 00:50:30,714
and wait just a bit longer.

506
00:50:30,714 --> 00:50:35,104
In 90% of adult cases, they are found somewhere drunk.

507
00:50:37,594 --> 00:50:39,204
What do we do now?

508
00:50:39,204 --> 00:50:40,904
If something happens to my assistant manager...

509
00:50:40,904 --> 00:50:42,744
Eonni, what do we do?

510
00:50:42,744 --> 00:50:45,134
- Where are you going? 
 - I need to do whatever I can!

511
00:50:45,134 --> 00:50:47,094
I should try going somewhere! How can I just sit idly by?

512
00:50:47,094 --> 00:50:48,854
Will you find an answer by just going somewhere randomly?

513
00:50:48,854 --> 00:50:50,634
You should think about it a little bit, at least!

514
00:50:50,634 --> 00:50:53,014
Then you want me just blankly to stand still here?

515
00:50:53,014 --> 00:50:54,714
I should at least try to find Kang Do Joon's car!

516
00:50:54,714 --> 00:50:57,244
That wasn't even Kang Do Joon's car! It was my husband's!

517
00:50:57,244 --> 00:50:59,024
Know something before you speak—

518
00:51:13,114 --> 00:51:16,944
Oh, oh! Let's go.

519
00:51:16,944 --> 00:51:18,234
I'll explain it to you later when we get there.

520
00:51:18,234 --> 00:51:20,064
Let's go. Hurry!

521
00:51:25,024 --> 00:51:26,494
Yes, Manager.

522
00:51:26,494 --> 00:51:31,504
Please turn off all the CCTVs for the underground parking lot, elevators, and the interior of the clinic.

523
00:51:32,504 --> 00:51:36,144
An important customer is coming, and she said she's uncomfortable with them.

524
00:51:44,884 --> 00:51:47,394
Yes, please do so.

525
00:52:03,254 --> 00:52:06,724
I admit it. I was too complacent.

526
00:52:06,724 --> 00:52:11,104
I guess I wanted to believe that woman, Hwang Ji Hye, had it.

527
00:52:12,304 --> 00:52:15,044
I also admit you're persistent.

528
00:52:15,044 --> 00:52:18,604
Wow, how did you manage to find it?

529
00:52:18,604 --> 00:52:20,924
You're really persistent.

530
00:52:23,414 --> 00:52:25,544
You don't seem to be very surprised.

531
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:30,204
Well, in any case, you don't have to worry a lot.

532
00:52:30,204 --> 00:52:33,864
If we manage to come to an agreement, I'll let you go.

533
00:52:33,864 --> 00:52:36,744
You? Don't kid me.

534
00:52:36,744 --> 00:52:39,404
All of this took place because of this.

535
00:52:39,404 --> 00:52:43,034
After this is gotten rid of, I'll release you.

536
00:52:52,774 --> 00:52:54,384
Oh, sorry.

537
00:52:54,384 --> 00:52:56,014
Are you okay?

538
00:53:27,604 --> 00:53:30,764
But I guess you're not curious about where we're going?

539
00:53:31,934 --> 00:53:35,304
If I ask you, will you even tell me?

540
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:40,034
You'll know when we get there.

541
00:53:43,534 --> 00:53:47,514
 The phone is turned off. You'll be connected to the voicemail.

542
00:53:47,514 --> 00:53:51,384
What's wrong? What is it that you are so concerned?

543
00:53:51,384 --> 00:53:52,774
She stopped in the middle of her text.

544
00:53:52,774 --> 00:53:54,794
And her phone is turned off.

545
00:53:55,844 --> 00:53:58,834
Check where Jang Mi Ho's phone is turned off.

546
00:54:00,944 --> 00:54:04,304
Eonni, I think they're headed to Gangnam.

547
00:54:04,304 --> 00:54:05,790
Gangnam?

548
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:07,160
 Bannaedong Keep Left / Gangnam Turn Right

549
00:55:00,414 --> 00:55:03,874
 You can't even function properly as a man.

550
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:09,054
 Apartment Ownership Transfer Agreement

551
00:55:11,264 --> 00:55:13,834
 Party A: Kang Do Joon / Party B: Oh Yu Jin

552
00:55:18,784 --> 00:55:22,134
 You can't even function as a man properly.

553
00:55:41,014 --> 00:55:42,384
 What?

554
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:56,464
 Adoption Record

555
00:56:06,094 --> 00:56:10,234
 Divorce? You lived with another guy and had a child with him!

556
00:56:10,234 --> 00:56:11,824
 And you're asking me to do what?

557
00:56:11,824 --> 00:56:16,334
 That's better than filming dirty and disgusting videos like you.

558
00:56:16,334 --> 00:56:18,474
 I'm the one who gets to say we should get divorced!

559
00:56:18,474 --> 00:56:20,754
 Someone like you can't say that to me!

560
00:56:20,754 --> 00:56:23,634
 If anyone's going to abandon or kill the other,

561
00:56:23,634 --> 00:56:25,384
 it's not you, but me!

562
00:56:25,384 --> 00:56:27,564
 Why do you look down on me?

563
00:56:33,684 --> 00:56:35,424
 I'll tell everyone!

564
00:56:35,424 --> 00:56:37,744
 That disgusting video you filmed,

565
00:56:37,744 --> 00:56:40,184
 and everything you've just done to me!

566
00:56:40,184 --> 00:56:42,064
 Damn you!

567
00:56:50,924 --> 00:56:53,504
 I'm supposed to go buy a wallet with him tomorrow after eating pasta.

568
00:56:53,504 --> 00:56:54,594
 Give me some recommendations.

569
00:56:54,594 --> 00:56:57,264
 Is Sim Ju Ah really selling her body for benefits?

570
00:56:58,184 --> 00:57:00,804
 Sim Ju Ah

571
00:57:18,104 --> 00:57:19,964
 Sim Ju Ah

572
00:58:04,324 --> 00:58:06,754
 Gangnam

573
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:39,110

574
00:58:41,434 --> 00:58:44,434
♫  Time to end the night  ♫

575
00:58:44,434 --> 00:58:50,074
♫  I don't know where the end is, but wake up anyway  ♫

576
00:58:50,074 --> 00:58:54,044
♫  I'll protect myself from the ruins  ♫

577
00:58:54,044 --> 00:58:56,774
♫  Don't be shy, it'll be fine  ♫

578
00:58:56,774 --> 00:58:59,404
♫  Now, take down the walls, get go  ♫

579
00:58:59,404 --> 00:59:02,004
♫  Time to end the night  ♫

580
00:59:02,004 --> 00:59:05,314
♫  I'll find everything and let go  ♫

581
00:59:05,314 --> 00:59:08,294
 Battle For Happiness

582
00:59:14,224 --> 00:59:15,614
 What is this?

583
00:59:15,614 --> 00:59:18,764
 I felt we were very similar.

584
00:59:18,764 --> 00:59:21,124
 Just kill me instead.

585
00:59:21,124 --> 00:59:24,694
 Then at least what you've done will be exposed to the world.

586
00:59:27,114 --> 00:59:30,554
 As parents, we shouldn't live our lives sinning against our kids.

587
00:59:30,554 --> 00:59:33,454
 Let's please just get back together.

588
00:59:34,494 --> 00:59:35,544
 What's wrong with you?

589
00:59:35,544 --> 00:59:38,774
 Could you let me stay by your side, Noona?

590
00:59:38,774 --> 00:59:40,654
 Please?

591
00:59:40,654 --> 00:59:46,504
 I hope you won't ever forget about us, even when we go to the US, Auntie.

592
00:59:46,504 --> 00:59:47,834
 I said, where are you!

593
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:51,034
 Help! Is nobody around!

594
00:59:53,504 --> 00:59:56,204
 I'm thinking about changing the plans.

595
00:59:57,964 --> 00:59:59,974
 We should just die together.

596
00:59:59,974 --> 01:00:01,334
♫  Time to end the night  ♫

597
01:00:01,334 --> 01:00:06,614
♫  I'll find everything and let go  ♫
