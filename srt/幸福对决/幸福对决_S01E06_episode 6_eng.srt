 What did you just say?

13
00:00:53,314 --> 00:00:55,624
 Do you have something to do with Yu Jin's death?

 Are you crazy? How dare you accuse me of murder!

 Hello, Mr. Lee Tae Ho. This is Jang Mi Ho from Unit 1004.

18
00:01:09,734 --> 00:01:13,204
 I have a question for you. When you see this note, please call me.

19
00:01:13,204 --> 00:01:15,914
 Do you think we don't know?

00:01:15,914 --> 00:01:18,614
 How your husband cheats on you?

 Eonni, aren't you looking for Oh Yu Jin's flash drive?

 Want to know something?

24
00:01:29,614 --> 00:01:32,514
 Jo Ah Ra is pregnant.

25
00:01:32,514 --> 00:01:35,194
 Worry about yourself.

 love@mom: What's going on Na Yeong?

32
00:02:13,264 --> 00:02:15,604
 Somebody get her right now.

33
00:02:20,684 --> 00:02:23,404
Kim Na Yeong? Open the door. Now!

34
00:02:23,404 --> 00:02:24,814
Kim Na Yeong!

35
00:02:24,814 --> 00:02:27,634
Ma'am, I need the key to the master bedroom.

36
00:02:27,634 --> 00:02:28,824
Hurry up!

37
00:02:28,824 --> 00:02:30,624
What is going on?

38
00:02:30,624 --> 00:02:32,604
Kim Na Yeong!

39
00:02:32,604 --> 00:02:34,664
- Kim Na Yeong!
 - Here.

40
00:02:34,664 --> 00:02:36,194
Turn to the right.

41
00:02:45,628 --> 00:02:48,248
Ma'am! Scissors! Get me scissors!

 Episode 6

43
00:02:58,948 --> 00:03:00,308
- What's going on? 
- I don't know.

44
00:03:00,308 --> 00:03:02,178
I heard noises coming from your floor.

45
00:03:02,178 --> 00:03:04,108
Gosh! What are you saying?

46
00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:08,358
Oh, my goodness, Na Yeong!

47
00:03:08,358 --> 00:03:10,208
What happened?

48
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,518
What's going on?

49
00:03:39,048 --> 00:03:41,668
...and then I called 911.

50
00:03:41,668 --> 00:03:43,618
Why did you do that?

51
00:03:44,508 --> 00:03:47,248
- What?
 - You knew she was mentally unstable.

52
00:03:47,248 --> 00:03:49,928
I told you in the emergency room.

53
00:03:49,928 --> 00:03:53,088
Why did you trigger a person like that?

54
00:03:53,088 --> 00:03:54,858
What are you talking about?

55
00:03:54,858 --> 00:03:56,918
You think I don't know?

56
00:03:56,918 --> 00:03:58,858
This whole situation is your fault!

57
00:03:58,858 --> 00:04:01,698
Excuse me, Mr. Lee Tae Ho, you're blaming me right now?

58
00:04:01,698 --> 00:04:03,518
Is this really the right situation for you to be behaving like this?

59
00:04:03,518 --> 00:04:09,978
There's no way you don't know why Na Yeong is in such pain, right?

60
00:04:09,978 --> 00:04:14,788
Anyway, if something happens to Na Yeong, I won't just let it go.

61
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:18,358
I'll make sure you're held accountable, so watch out.

62
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:22,571
Hey, Attorney Park.

63
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:24,971
Something happened to my wife.

64
00:04:28,521 --> 00:04:31,091
What happened? Is Na Yeong all right?

65
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:33,601
Yes. They'll move her to the regular ward soon.

66
00:04:33,601 --> 00:04:36,587
 But why did Na Yeong do that?

67
00:04:36,587 --> 00:04:38,667
I don't know.

68
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:43,387
But Mi Ho, you were there. You don't have any guesses?

69
00:04:43,387 --> 00:04:44,807
I really don't know.

70
00:04:44,807 --> 00:04:47,817
Please don't ask me such questions.

71
00:04:54,144 --> 00:04:56,004
What did she say? Why did she do it?

72
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,234
She told me to stop asking her such questions.

73
00:04:58,234 --> 00:05:00,334
What? Maybe there's really something going on there.

74
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:01,844
Why was she even there?

75
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:03,284
Think about it.

76
00:05:03,284 --> 00:05:07,034
We all know that Na Yeong couldn't stand to be around Mi Ho.

77
00:05:07,034 --> 00:05:09,794
They got into a fight at the kids' cafe that time.

78
00:05:09,794 --> 00:05:13,264
I mean, Jang Mi Ho has a strong personality, too.

79
00:05:13,264 --> 00:05:16,254
They may have lived separate lives, but they were still sisters.

80
00:05:16,254 --> 00:05:20,044
Your environment contributes so much to your personality development.

81
00:05:20,044 --> 00:05:22,444
I don't want to speak ill of the dead,

82
00:05:22,444 --> 00:05:25,424
but Yu Jin also had quite a personality, no?

83
00:05:25,424 --> 00:05:28,044
Well, nothing is confirmed yet.

84
00:05:28,044 --> 00:05:32,224
Let's not gossip about someone who's going through a tough time.

85
00:05:35,564 --> 00:05:37,924
When should we visit her at the hospital?

86
00:05:46,264 --> 00:05:48,734
 Want to know something?

87
00:05:48,734 --> 00:05:50,964
 Jo Ah Ra is pregnant.

88
00:05:55,704 --> 00:05:56,744
 Stop lying.

89
00:05:56,744 --> 00:06:00,904
 And you think you can tell me what to do?

90
00:06:00,904 --> 00:06:02,314
 Worry about yourself.

91
00:06:02,314 --> 00:06:05,014

 Did you think I didn't know?

95
00:06:20,654 --> 00:06:22,614
 Oh Yu Jin had your secrets in her hands.

96
00:06:22,614 --> 00:06:26,344
 I'll tell Jang Mi Ho everything if things go wrong.

97
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,054
 And also...

98
00:06:29,054 --> 00:06:31,954
 what we did before Oh Yu Jin died.

 Kim Na Yeong? How? Grudge? Affair?

101
00:06:57,904 --> 00:07:00,394
I totally got it wrong.

 Ji Yool, Ha Yool after school pickup

103
00:07:47,594 --> 00:07:50,294
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

104
00:07:50,294 --> 00:07:51,814
Try standing up.

105
00:07:55,854 --> 00:07:57,664
That must hurt.

106
00:07:57,664 --> 00:07:59,864
Where's your mom?

107
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:03,664
You know your mom's number, right?

108
00:08:03,664 --> 00:08:05,974
Tell me your mom's phone number.

109
00:08:13,254 --> 00:08:16,464
- Joon Ha!
 - Mom!

110
00:08:16,464 --> 00:08:17,884
My goodness.

111
00:08:17,884 --> 00:08:19,674
Aigoo, my goodness.

112
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:24,045
What should we do? He got hurt.

113
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,104
It's not too bad.

114
00:08:26,104 --> 00:08:30,524
He switched to a two-wheel bike recently. He's still getting used to it.

115
00:08:30,524 --> 00:08:32,031
You're not hurt, right?

116
00:08:32,031 --> 00:08:33,341
I'm fine.

117
00:08:33,341 --> 00:08:36,271
You never know, so you should take him to the hospital.

118
00:08:36,271 --> 00:08:39,171
I don't think that's necessary.

119
00:08:39,171 --> 00:08:42,201
You can go ahead if you need to attend to something.

120
00:08:42,201 --> 00:08:44,491
I'm sorry. Go to the hospital, okay?

121
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:45,931
Okay.

122
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,351
I told you to be careful.

123
00:08:49,351 --> 00:08:51,951
You should ride it on a field.

124
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:59,101
Pink school, purple school, one and two.

125
00:08:59,101 --> 00:09:01,361
Put them on the cupcake...

126
00:09:01,361 --> 00:09:04,651
- Real Auntie! 
- Real Auntie!

127
00:09:04,651 --> 00:09:07,061
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

128
00:09:07,061 --> 00:09:08,531
I'm sorry I'm late.

129
00:09:08,531 --> 00:09:11,841
Auntie! Auntie! Can we go to the kids' cafe today, too?

130
00:09:11,841 --> 00:09:14,711
All the other kids went.

131
00:09:14,711 --> 00:09:16,291
All the other kids went?

132
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:20,711
We wanted to go with them, but they didn't take us.

133
00:09:20,711 --> 00:09:24,491
You weren't comfortable with other people taking them last time,

134
00:09:24,491 --> 00:09:27,161
so I was looking after them.

135
00:09:27,161 --> 00:09:28,731
Sure.

136
00:09:28,731 --> 00:09:31,571
But is Ah Rin's mother okay?

137
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,561
I heard there was an accident.

138
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:37,151
What kind of accident?

139
00:09:37,941 --> 00:09:39,961
If you're that curious, look into it yourself.

140
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:41,901
That shouldn't be too hard for you.

141
00:09:41,901 --> 00:09:43,331
Let's go.

142
00:09:58,751 --> 00:10:01,591
We want to go to the kids' cafe, too.

143
00:10:01,591 --> 00:10:04,371
Auntie! Can we please go too?

144
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:07,941
- We can't.
 - Why not?

145
00:10:08,981 --> 00:10:10,831
I don't like it there.

146
00:10:10,831 --> 00:10:13,591
Besides, I need to leave soon.

147
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:16,651
Are you going somewhere?

148
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,051
Never mind.

149
00:10:22,051 --> 00:10:24,121
Play with me today. What do you want to do?

150
00:10:24,121 --> 00:10:25,641
I want to play princess with Sophia!

151
00:10:25,641 --> 00:10:26,931
I want to do origami!

152
00:10:26,931 --> 00:10:28,281
Okay, let's do both. Let's go!

153
00:10:28,281 --> 00:10:31,131
Let's have some fun. Let's go, go, go!

154
00:10:33,641 --> 00:10:35,841
Sorry. I just saw your message.

155
00:10:35,841 --> 00:10:39,471
I got off work. Should I swing by the mall and pick it up?

156
00:10:39,471 --> 00:10:41,461
 No, I asked Jeong Woon to do it.

157
00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:44,431
 He says he'll be here soon. Don't worry about it.

158
00:10:44,431 --> 00:10:45,821
Really?

159
00:10:45,821 --> 00:10:47,971
I should have checked my phone earlier.

160
00:10:47,971 --> 00:10:50,121
I wanted to do it for you.

161
00:10:51,121 --> 00:10:53,161
Do you need anything else?

162
00:10:53,161 --> 00:10:54,741
 No. What's going on?

163
00:10:54,741 --> 00:10:57,001
 Why are you acting all sweet?

164
00:10:58,721 --> 00:11:01,081
When was I not sweet?

165
00:11:01,081 --> 00:11:04,341
You're all I've got. Of course, I want to be good to you.

166
00:11:04,341 --> 00:11:07,241
 You're so adorable.

167
00:11:08,411 --> 00:11:10,071
 See you at home.

168
00:11:10,071 --> 00:11:12,611
Okay, bye.

169
00:11:34,071 --> 00:11:36,041
I thought your brother was here.

170
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:39,601
I had asked for a favor. So, I went to get it.

171
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:40,821
What's this?

172
00:11:40,821 --> 00:11:44,951
The sales associate recommended this new fragrance.

173
00:11:44,951 --> 00:11:47,201
The bag I've been waiting for is finally here.

174
00:11:47,201 --> 00:11:49,701
Jeong Woon said he'd pick up both,

175
00:11:49,701 --> 00:11:52,851
so I asked him to get a bunch of them for you ladies.

176
00:11:52,851 --> 00:11:54,601
This is so nice!

177
00:11:54,601 --> 00:11:57,341
Eonni, you are so generous.

178
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:00,831
Many people have money, but only a few spend it well.

179
00:12:00,831 --> 00:12:01,971
So true.

180
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,811
I heard you were looking for a writing tutor?

181
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:07,701
You've been on the wait list for Daechi Writing for two years, right?

182
00:12:07,701 --> 00:12:10,791
I know a tutor who used to work there. Do you want their number?

183
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:15,001
Really? Eonni, I would be so grateful.

184
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:18,601
- That's what friends are for. 
- Mommy.

185
00:12:18,601 --> 00:12:20,651
When is Ji Yool coming?

186
00:12:20,651 --> 00:12:22,761
Ah Rin isn't here, either.

187
00:12:23,671 --> 00:12:26,691
Ji Yool can't make it today.

188
00:12:26,691 --> 00:12:28,871
Go play with the other kids.

189
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:34,921
It's bugging me a bit that we left them behind.

190
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:39,901
I heard their aunt said not to let the kids leave with anybody.

191
00:12:39,901 --> 00:12:41,871
Are we just "anybody"?

192
00:12:41,871 --> 00:12:44,871
Anyway, I really can't warm up to that woman.

193
00:12:44,871 --> 00:12:46,031
You're right.

194
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:49,421
Right. What a sad thing for her to say.

195
00:12:49,421 --> 00:12:54,921
I've been thinking. We can't just ignore the Na Yeong issue.

196
00:12:54,921 --> 00:12:57,131
What do you mean?

197
00:12:57,131 --> 00:13:00,181
I mean, you all know.

198
00:13:00,181 --> 00:13:04,571
After what happened to Yu Jin, Na Yeong has been mentally unstable.

199
00:13:04,571 --> 00:13:07,571
Now, that woman has been bullying Na Yeong.

200
00:13:07,571 --> 00:13:12,891
I heard she even accused Na Yeong of murdering Yu Jin.

201
00:13:12,891 --> 00:13:14,621
Right!

202
00:13:14,621 --> 00:13:18,111
That means she hung out with her this whole time while suspecting her.

203
00:13:18,111 --> 00:13:20,131
I'm getting chills.

204
00:13:20,131 --> 00:13:21,711
Am I the only one who thinks that?

205
00:13:21,711 --> 00:13:26,391
Why else would Na Yeong do such a thing?

206
00:13:26,391 --> 00:13:29,811
In reality, we don't know anything about that woman.

207
00:13:29,811 --> 00:13:34,761
I think we let her in too easily because she's the kids' aunt.

208
00:13:34,761 --> 00:13:36,641
I'm only talking about this because the situation has come this far,

209
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:38,841
but I never liked her from the beginning.

210
00:13:38,841 --> 00:13:42,881
Her demeanor is so stiff, and I never know what she's thinking.

211
00:13:42,881 --> 00:13:46,491
I'm not the only one who thinks that, right?

212
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:50,741
Anyway, let's keep our distance going forward.

213
00:14:06,961 --> 00:14:10,621
- Mr. Han. 
-  I set up a public SNS account as you wanted.

214
00:14:10,621 --> 00:14:12,881
Okay. Good work.

215
00:14:13,991 --> 00:14:19,161
Also, ask Mr. Gong for one more thing. I'm sending over a card.

216
00:14:19,161 --> 00:14:21,951
At the head office, there's someone named Assistant Manager Jang Mi Ho.

217
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:24,621
Dig up dirt on her. About her past.

218
00:14:24,621 --> 00:14:28,191
 Not since 11th grade in high school...

219
00:14:28,191 --> 00:14:29,871
 So it had been 18 years.

220
00:14:29,871 --> 00:14:32,451
Focus on her high school years.

221
00:14:32,451 --> 00:14:37,471
I think we'll be using those accounts.

222
00:14:49,861 --> 00:14:53,111
Ta-da! Carnation. Who wants it?

223
00:14:53,111 --> 00:14:54,911
Me! I want it!

224
00:14:54,911 --> 00:14:57,321
It's my turn.

225
00:14:58,191 --> 00:15:00,341
Don't fight. Wait...

226
00:15:02,681 --> 00:15:04,671
Hold on.

227
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:12,891
- Hello?
 -  Hello, Ms. Jang Mi Ho. It's been a while.

228
00:15:12,891 --> 00:15:16,631
Oh, yes. How have you been?

229
00:15:16,631 --> 00:15:17,861
What's going on?

230
00:15:17,861 --> 00:15:23,411
I think I found someone who can look after the kids.

231
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:29,431
So when will they start?

232
00:15:29,431 --> 00:15:32,981
I'll need to talk to them, but probably two or three days.

233
00:15:32,981 --> 00:15:37,031
Let's plan that for now. I'll call you again tomorrow.

234
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:49,821
Who was that?

235
00:15:49,821 --> 00:15:51,001
Grandpa.

236
00:15:51,001 --> 00:15:53,181
Why did Grandpa call?

237
00:15:56,601 --> 00:16:00,031
I'll tell you when I know for sure.

238
00:16:01,881 --> 00:16:05,771
It's time for bed. Should we go inside?

239
00:16:05,771 --> 00:16:07,251
I'm going first next time.

240
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:10,411
No! I will be first again next time!

241
00:16:10,411 --> 00:16:12,761
How is that fair?

242
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,181
Are you awake?

243
00:16:42,521 --> 00:16:44,511
What?

244
00:16:44,511 --> 00:16:46,551
My phone...

245
00:16:46,551 --> 00:16:51,551
The officers took it a while ago.

246
00:16:51,551 --> 00:16:53,461
No...

247
00:16:54,401 --> 00:16:56,471
Yours, Dad...

248
00:17:01,081 --> 00:17:02,851
This? Why?

249
00:17:09,101 --> 00:17:11,781
 The murder case of the Bannae-dong couple

250
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:14,321
 The grotesque crime scene. Resentment? Affair? Three unanswered questions from the Bannae-dong murder.

251
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:32,181
Her absence is palpable.

252
00:17:35,991 --> 00:17:37,581
 Assistant Manager Jang Mi Ho

253
00:17:50,121 --> 00:17:52,741
 If I'm not okay, what difference does it make?

254
00:17:52,741 --> 00:17:55,891
 There's nothing I can do.

255
00:17:59,131 --> 00:18:02,071
 Ms. Jang Mi Ho

256
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:07,271
 Call

257
00:18:08,901 --> 00:18:11,521
- Assistant Manager!
  - What now? What's going on?

258
00:18:11,521 --> 00:18:14,061
Does something need to be wrong for me to call?

259
00:18:14,061 --> 00:18:16,211
I was just wondering if you were feeling okay.

260
00:18:16,211 --> 00:18:17,891
Is everything good?

261
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,381
No, everything is not good.

262
00:18:23,381 --> 00:18:25,871
Why? Tell me.

263
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:27,861
Tell me!

264
00:18:27,861 --> 00:18:30,311
Really? The emergency room?

265
00:18:30,311 --> 00:18:32,231
Are you okay?

266
00:18:44,301 --> 00:18:47,111
It could have gone so wrong for Kim Na Yeong.

267
00:18:49,751 --> 00:18:53,931
She'll be okay, so you take care of yourself now.

268
00:18:54,681 --> 00:18:58,111
♫  I, I don't mind mine  ♫

269
00:18:58,111 --> 00:19:01,891
♫  Unlike the way you are  ♫

270
00:19:03,671 --> 00:19:05,451
So you're really coming back?

271
00:19:05,451 --> 00:19:07,441
 I'm thinking about it.

272
00:19:08,441 --> 00:19:10,211
That's the right call.

273
00:19:10,211 --> 00:19:11,801
You should call the team leader sometime.

274
00:19:11,801 --> 00:19:14,541
 Sure. But where are you?

275
00:19:15,511 --> 00:19:17,131
I'm home.

276
00:19:18,081 --> 00:19:19,411
Yes.

277
00:19:20,221 --> 00:19:23,221
Yes. I'll call you again soon.

278
00:19:27,821 --> 00:19:28,861
 Parenting Solutions

279
00:19:36,511 --> 00:19:39,151
 Team Leader Seo Gyeong Joon

280
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:48,041
What are you guys doing, not sleeping?

281
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,651
Huh?

282
00:19:49,651 --> 00:19:51,151
I want to sleep with you, Auntie.

283
00:19:51,151 --> 00:19:54,021
I want to sleep with you, too.

284
00:19:54,021 --> 00:19:55,501
What's with you guys?

285
00:19:55,501 --> 00:20:00,241
Let's sleep together! We want to be next to you!

286
00:20:07,201 --> 00:20:09,161
No.

287
00:20:09,161 --> 00:20:10,531
You guys can't sleep here.

288
00:20:10,531 --> 00:20:11,901
- Get up. Now. 
- No!

289
00:20:11,901 --> 00:20:14,131
We're going to sleep here.

290
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:16,561
I can't baby you guys right now.

291
00:20:16,561 --> 00:20:19,151
You need to sleep by yourselves, okay?

292
00:20:22,591 --> 00:20:24,711
I hate you, Auntie!

293
00:20:26,181 --> 00:20:28,291
What's wrong with you guys?

294
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,001
I'm not going!

295
00:20:30,001 --> 00:20:33,081
I'm not going! I won't!

296
00:20:33,081 --> 00:20:35,301
Why not?

297
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:36,941
Get in.

298
00:20:38,731 --> 00:20:41,091
What is going on?

299
00:20:41,091 --> 00:20:42,621
I won't know unless you tell me.

300
00:20:42,621 --> 00:20:45,741
If you don't tell me, how would I know?

301
00:20:45,741 --> 00:20:47,591
No! No!

302
00:20:47,591 --> 00:20:50,241
No!

303
00:20:50,241 --> 00:20:54,051
Go ahead. It'll get better once you're out of sight.

304
00:20:54,051 --> 00:20:57,621
Let go. If you don't, I will.

305
00:20:57,621 --> 00:21:00,481
Real Auntie!

306
00:21:08,121 --> 00:21:10,611
I'm not your real auntie.

307
00:21:17,971 --> 00:21:19,701
I'm sorry.

308
00:22:26,421 --> 00:22:28,611
Mr. Seo, it's me.

309
00:22:34,451 --> 00:22:37,001
 DGB Financial Group

310
00:22:37,001 --> 00:22:41,191
Is this your living room or something—to come and go as you please?

311
00:22:41,851 --> 00:22:45,701
Should I come back to work starting next Monday?

312
00:22:46,701 --> 00:22:48,771
As you wish.

313
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:53,561
Oh, is everything handled?

314
00:22:53,561 --> 00:22:56,291
Yeah, sure. I think he found someone to take care of the kids.

315
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,811
That's a relief.

316
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:01,461
But what if you get stuck with them again later?

317
00:23:01,461 --> 00:23:04,231
You won't go on parental leave and whatnot, right?

318
00:23:04,231 --> 00:23:06,311
Do you think I'm crazy?

319
00:23:06,311 --> 00:23:09,491
Right, Ms. Jang, you're no young fool.

320
00:23:09,491 --> 00:23:11,871
- Let's go.
 - Fool?

321
00:23:13,081 --> 00:23:14,541
What are you doing?

322
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:17,411
Are you that happy your dearly missed superior is back?

323
00:23:17,411 --> 00:23:19,511
What are you talking about?

324
00:23:19,511 --> 00:23:21,641
Since you're here, register with HR before you leave.

325
00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:25,741
Maybe give updates on the monthly remote customer numbers while you're at it.

326
00:23:25,741 --> 00:23:28,261
All you think about is squeezing all the juice out of everyone.

327
00:23:28,261 --> 00:23:32,591
Hey, man, I wouldn't need to if you hadn't lost all the data.

328
00:23:32,591 --> 00:23:35,011
How long will you bring that up?

329
00:23:38,621 --> 00:23:41,751
It's time for everything to return to its place.

330
00:23:41,751 --> 00:23:43,261
You've done as much as you could.

331
00:23:43,261 --> 00:23:46,871
You went through so much taking care of the kids due to their grandfather's situation.

332
00:23:49,201 --> 00:23:51,881
But I do feel bad for the kids.

333
00:23:54,701 --> 00:23:59,381
You think kids that age don't know what's going on with adults,

334
00:23:59,381 --> 00:24:01,251
but they understand everything.

335
00:24:01,251 --> 00:24:05,231
Like, who abandoned them, who really loves them.

336
00:24:07,871 --> 00:24:09,581
Is Kim Na Yeong doing any better?

337
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:11,571
I heard she wasn't seriously hurt.

338
00:24:11,571 --> 00:24:14,291
I don't know. I haven't heard anything.

339
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:17,441
It wasn't your fault, Ms. Jang. Don't let it get to you.

340
00:24:17,441 --> 00:24:19,901
Let's go. I need to head out.

341
00:24:19,901 --> 00:24:22,191
Go after lunch. All you've had is coffee.

342
00:24:22,191 --> 00:24:24,841
I need to drop by somewhere before the kids get out of school.

343
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:28,351
 Restricted Area

344
00:24:31,411 --> 00:24:34,101
We can't even drop by briefly?

345
00:24:34,101 --> 00:24:35,721
She needs rest.

346
00:24:35,721 --> 00:24:39,661
Her guardian asked to not allow any visitors.

347
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:44,571
Then, please give this to her.

348
00:24:48,261 --> 00:24:50,761
Does he think people don't know? We can't even hear updates?

349
00:24:50,761 --> 00:24:52,601
I know, right?

350
00:24:52,601 --> 00:24:53,941
Should I call Jeong Ah?

351
00:24:53,941 --> 00:24:55,381
No, I'll do it.

352
00:24:55,381 --> 00:24:58,231
- These two tables are for the VIP guests.
 - Yes.

353
00:24:58,231 --> 00:24:59,811
This one is for the foreign investors.

354
00:24:59,811 --> 00:25:01,511
Yes, ma'am.

355
00:25:06,011 --> 00:25:07,811
Hey. How did it go?

356
00:25:07,811 --> 00:25:10,481
They're not allowing visitors. We got kicked out.

357
00:25:10,481 --> 00:25:13,291
Really? That's too bad.

358
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:17,301
Can you or Seong Hui make a separate group chat for Gold Moms?

359
00:25:19,031 --> 00:25:21,081
You want to totally exclude Jang Mi Ho?

360
00:25:21,081 --> 00:25:22,291
 Of course.

361
00:25:22,291 --> 00:25:25,901
How can we let the perpetrator and the victim be in one group chat?

362
00:25:25,901 --> 00:25:29,961
Anyway, sorry I couldn't come with you guys. Thanks for doing that.

363
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:31,371
Bye.

364
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:35,221
 Secretary Han Joon Gyeong

365
00:25:40,751 --> 00:25:42,681
Hey, what's up?

366
00:25:43,511 --> 00:25:45,011
Already?

367
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,611
Mr. Gong sure knows what he's doing.

368
00:25:48,611 --> 00:25:50,201
Yeah.

369
00:25:50,201 --> 00:25:51,631
Yeah.

370
00:25:52,671 --> 00:25:54,851
Seora High School?

371
00:25:59,461 --> 00:26:02,731
Let's talk about the details later. Send me the photo first.

372
00:26:14,261 --> 00:26:19,671
She's been putting on an act, fooling everyone this whole time.

373
00:26:31,021 --> 00:26:32,881
Hello.

374
00:26:45,311 --> 00:26:48,551
Where did my mother go?

375
00:26:48,551 --> 00:26:52,961
What? She said she was going to go read a little while ago.

376
00:26:52,961 --> 00:26:57,331
Aigoo, she left on time for you to come again.

377
00:26:57,331 --> 00:26:59,891
What is she upset about this time?

378
00:26:59,891 --> 00:27:01,441
I don't think it's like that.

379
00:27:01,441 --> 00:27:05,421
You don't? I think she's mad because you haven't come in a few days.

380
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:12,451
 Mom

381
00:27:15,341 --> 00:27:17,381
 The call is not going through...

382
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:32,011
 Happiness Nursing Home

383
00:27:46,761 --> 00:27:49,351
 Mi Ho, my daughter

384
00:27:58,191 --> 00:28:00,551
I'm sorry. I've been busy.

385
00:28:06,711 --> 00:28:09,281
You know I'm up for a promotion.

386
00:28:10,681 --> 00:28:13,491
Why are you talking like that?

387
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:17,391
Making me out to be a shameless person, nagging a busy daughter.

388
00:28:20,371 --> 00:28:23,451
I'm sorry for assuming.

389
00:28:25,031 --> 00:28:27,491
You said you wanted tteokbokki. This is famous—

390
00:28:27,491 --> 00:28:29,591
I called your workplace.

391
00:28:29,591 --> 00:28:32,131
They asked me, did I not know?

392
00:28:32,131 --> 00:28:34,451
It was humiliating.

393
00:28:35,961 --> 00:28:38,281
I meant to tell you.

394
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:41,151
When? After I'm dead?

395
00:28:41,151 --> 00:28:42,481
Don't say that.

396
00:28:42,481 --> 00:28:45,121
Because you're being a doormat!

397
00:28:45,121 --> 00:28:48,041
- How come she's sucking you dry even after she's dead? 
 - Mom!

398
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:51,021
It's her fault that your life has been so directionless.

399
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:54,451
And now? You're watching her kids?

400
00:28:55,161 --> 00:28:58,261
As they say, don't take in animals with black hair.

401
00:28:58,261 --> 00:28:59,801
Just look at me.

402
00:28:59,801 --> 00:29:02,481
I'm sure they take after their blood. I don't have to see to know.

403
00:29:02,481 --> 00:29:04,301
Don't be cruel. They're just kids.

404
00:29:04,301 --> 00:29:07,681
You watch them for a few days, and now you're defending them?

405
00:29:08,931 --> 00:29:11,301
Maybe it's a good thing.

406
00:29:11,301 --> 00:29:14,721
They couldn't have grown up properly with a mother like that.

407
00:29:14,721 --> 00:29:17,061
How can you say that?

408
00:29:17,061 --> 00:29:18,551
Am I wrong?

409
00:29:18,551 --> 00:29:19,991
I'm just so upset.

410
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:22,241
Before she got married, she shamelessly showed her face.

411
00:29:22,241 --> 00:29:25,691
Now you're stuck with her kids?

412
00:29:25,691 --> 00:29:28,871
Came to you before she got married? Who?

413
00:29:31,071 --> 00:29:33,241
Didn't I tell you?

414
00:29:33,241 --> 00:29:36,171
She came to me once before she got married and once after she had her kids.

415
00:29:36,171 --> 00:29:38,041
She was looking for you.

416
00:29:38,951 --> 00:29:40,571
Why...

417
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:43,001
Wh-Why didn't you tell me?

418
00:29:43,001 --> 00:29:45,601
Because it was so obvious!

419
00:29:45,601 --> 00:29:48,511
She was just trying to fill those wedding guest seats!

420
00:29:48,511 --> 00:29:51,331
She's been that cunning since she was little.

421
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,741
What if it wasn't like that?

422
00:29:54,741 --> 00:29:59,001
The last time I saw her, we were screaming at each other.

423
00:29:59,001 --> 00:30:04,071
She died before I ever got to really talk to her again.

424
00:30:05,461 --> 00:30:06,571
What if...

425
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:09,391
What if she wanted to make it right?

426
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:12,881
What if that's why she came to visit?

427
00:30:12,881 --> 00:30:15,771
Yeah, right. She'd never.

428
00:30:15,771 --> 00:30:18,291
Do you know how much I...

429
00:30:18,291 --> 00:30:21,661
Why didn't you tell me something so important!

430
00:30:24,451 --> 00:30:26,731
Where are you going?

431
00:30:26,731 --> 00:30:30,071
She's throwing her weight around just because she's making money.

432
00:30:47,801 --> 00:30:51,461
 That was the best year of my life.

433
00:30:52,771 --> 00:30:55,991
 Seora High School

434
00:31:06,771 --> 00:31:09,441
 My hair had grown past my shoulders like I wanted.

435
00:31:09,441 --> 00:31:11,801
 I grew 5 centimeters.

436
00:31:11,801 --> 00:31:17,011
 I was second in my homeroom class and 19th in the whole school. The best ranking I ever had.

437
00:31:17,011 --> 00:31:22,101
 My mom was so, so proud of me that day.

438
00:31:23,111 --> 00:31:27,291
 I thought days like that would just continue to happen.

439
00:31:32,371 --> 00:31:36,671
Is it true about what happened with your stepfather?

440
00:31:38,151 --> 00:31:39,611
No.

441
00:31:40,511 --> 00:31:43,931
Nothing happened between me and my stepfather.

442
00:31:43,931 --> 00:31:47,311
Nothing happened with your stepfather.

443
00:31:47,311 --> 00:31:53,031
 Investigation Committee for School Violence

444
00:31:53,031 --> 00:31:55,191
 November 2003

445
00:31:57,241 --> 00:31:59,431
Mi Ho, come eat!

446
00:31:59,431 --> 00:32:01,071
Coming!

447
00:32:03,101 --> 00:32:05,771
Gosh, why don't you be more like Yu Jin?

448
00:32:05,771 --> 00:32:10,231
She comes down every morning to help me make breakfast.

449
00:32:11,801 --> 00:32:13,841
These days, YuJin is why I live.

450
00:32:13,841 --> 00:32:16,411
- Yu Jin, eat plenty.
 - Yes.

451
00:32:16,411 --> 00:32:18,701
Let's pray.

452
00:32:18,701 --> 00:32:22,141
Dear Lord, thank you for this food.

453
00:32:22,141 --> 00:32:24,721
In Jesus' name, we pray.

454
00:32:24,721 --> 00:32:26,661
 Amen.

455
00:32:33,861 --> 00:32:35,631
Eat.

456
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:43,491
 Sex Education  
Pass this back.

457
00:32:55,791 --> 00:32:58,721
Hey! Wait for me.

458
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:03,501
Who was that boy you were standing with in the hallway?

459
00:33:03,501 --> 00:33:06,441
The leader of the math research team. He wanted to ask me something.

460
00:33:06,441 --> 00:33:09,361
It didn't look like he was just asking.

461
00:33:12,001 --> 00:33:13,741
You're looking good these days.

462
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:15,671
It's all because of me.

463
00:33:15,671 --> 00:33:17,951
What are you talking about?

464
00:33:17,951 --> 00:33:19,761
Oh, by the way...

465
00:33:22,241 --> 00:33:24,311
I took a couple of those.

466
00:33:24,311 --> 00:33:25,631
What?

467
00:33:26,641 --> 00:33:28,131
Really?

468
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,931
You said I should take some when they were collecting.

469
00:33:32,461 --> 00:33:34,501
I'm keeping them.

470
00:33:34,501 --> 00:33:36,881
- Why would you need them?
 - Why do you need them?

471
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:38,941
I'm the one who told you to take them.

472
00:33:38,941 --> 00:33:41,611
- Just in case? 
 - Same.

473
00:33:41,611 --> 00:33:43,361
Stop joking. It won't be for a while.

474
00:33:43,361 --> 00:33:45,621
Let's make balloons with these.

475
00:33:45,621 --> 00:33:47,661
Hey!

476
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,881
How do you not even have an ID yet?

477
00:33:50,881 --> 00:33:54,711
If I get caught doing this, my mom will kill me.

478
00:33:54,711 --> 00:33:57,481
It's just chatting.

479
00:33:57,481 --> 00:34:00,081
I'll just make your ID the same as your email.

480
00:34:00,081 --> 00:34:02,311
What do you want for your password?

481
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,161
I'll just use mine.

482
00:34:07,161 --> 00:34:08,411
 00yj0328

483
00:34:09,451 --> 00:34:11,711
You always use that password.

484
00:34:11,711 --> 00:34:13,441
What does it mean?

485
00:34:14,971 --> 00:34:16,821
My biological mom's birthday.

486
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:23,561
 Hey, girls, I'm home!

487
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:31,731
Coming!

488
00:34:37,001 --> 00:34:40,221
Mi Ho, Yu Jin, we're going to be late for church.

489
00:34:47,431 --> 00:34:49,591
I told you to wear socks.

490
00:34:49,591 --> 00:34:52,421
Your temperature will drop. How many times do I have to tell you?

491
00:34:58,901 --> 00:35:04,441
 I just assumed that Yu Jin and I would be on the same page.

492
00:35:26,681 --> 00:35:31,091
My gosh! Yu Jin, Mi Ho, you are young ladies now.

493
00:35:31,091 --> 00:35:33,361
You guys look so happy together.

494
00:35:33,361 --> 00:35:35,031
God's grace is with you.

495
00:35:35,031 --> 00:35:39,531
Right. There must be so much laughter every day.

496
00:35:39,531 --> 00:35:42,301
- Enjoy your meal.
 - You, too.

497
00:35:43,321 --> 00:35:46,761
 But just like how a butterfly fluttering its wings can cause a typhoon,

498
00:35:46,761 --> 00:35:51,391
 one crack changed everything completely.

499
00:35:53,801 --> 00:35:56,891
Mi Ho! Oh, my goodness!

500
00:35:56,891 --> 00:35:58,891
Mi Ho!

501
00:35:58,891 --> 00:36:01,511
Are you all right? Let me see.

502
00:36:01,511 --> 00:36:03,251
Are you hurt?

503
00:36:05,201 --> 00:36:07,881
I can't walk.

504
00:36:07,881 --> 00:36:09,711
I told you not to play around like that.

505
00:36:09,711 --> 00:36:11,601
She got hurt because of you!

506
00:36:11,601 --> 00:36:14,211
You should get to the hospital. You can't walk at all?

507
00:36:14,211 --> 00:36:16,181
Elder, please carry her on your back.

508
00:36:16,181 --> 00:36:17,681
Me?

509
00:36:17,681 --> 00:36:19,241
Hurry up!

510
00:36:19,241 --> 00:36:21,651
No, I'm okay.

511
00:36:21,651 --> 00:36:25,091
Mi Ho, come on. Mi Ho, hurry.

512
00:36:25,091 --> 00:36:27,001
Careful, careful.

513
00:36:27,001 --> 00:36:28,741
One, two, three.

514
00:36:30,151 --> 00:36:31,701
Gently.

515
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:35,481
This way.

516
00:36:35,481 --> 00:36:38,071
I hope it's not too bad.

517
00:36:51,661 --> 00:36:53,511
Jang Mi Ho.

518
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:54,781
Sit over there.

519
00:36:54,781 --> 00:36:56,031
Why?

520
00:36:56,031 --> 00:36:57,861
Do what I say.

521
00:37:02,141 --> 00:37:06,201
You weren't even that hurt. Why did you make a fuss?

522
00:37:08,461 --> 00:37:10,451
Honey, eat.

523
00:37:10,451 --> 00:37:12,371
Oh, yes.

524
00:37:16,021 --> 00:37:18,161
- Bye.
 - See you later.

525
00:37:18,161 --> 00:37:19,681
Jang Mi Ho.

526
00:37:20,591 --> 00:37:22,291
Stand straight.

527
00:37:25,751 --> 00:37:27,521
Let's cut your hair.

528
00:37:27,521 --> 00:37:29,901
You're a student. You should look modest.

529
00:37:29,901 --> 00:37:32,881
No! I don't want to. I'm really growing it out this time.

530
00:37:32,881 --> 00:37:35,031
You'll be a high school senior next year.

531
00:37:35,031 --> 00:37:37,201
How will you study with your hair in the way?

532
00:37:37,201 --> 00:37:40,261
What does my hair have to do with my studies? I study really hard.

533
00:37:40,261 --> 00:37:42,231
This is not the time to care about your appearance.

534
00:37:42,231 --> 00:37:44,871
You don't say anything to Yu Jin. Why are you picking on me?

535
00:37:44,871 --> 00:37:46,831
The two of you aren't the same!

536
00:37:47,881 --> 00:37:49,961
Come home early after school.

537
00:37:49,961 --> 00:37:53,781
You're not going to let your mom down, are you?

538
00:37:59,641 --> 00:38:03,071
 Why do I have to go through this?

539
00:38:03,071 --> 00:38:09,401
 I hated Yu Jin, and I hated my mom for only being on her side.

540
00:38:20,511 --> 00:38:22,671
Stop crying.

541
00:38:22,671 --> 00:38:25,111
Hair grows back.

542
00:38:25,111 --> 00:38:28,231
You know my hair doesn't grow fast.

543
00:38:28,231 --> 00:38:31,201
Why is Mom just picking on me and not you?

544
00:38:31,201 --> 00:38:33,261
Why play favorites?

545
00:38:37,271 --> 00:38:42,211
You really don't know? Why Mom is being like that?

546
00:38:46,171 --> 00:38:49,531
She's jealous of you as a woman.

547
00:38:50,831 --> 00:38:53,491
- What?
 - Some mothers are jealous of their daughters.

548
00:38:53,491 --> 00:38:57,511
In the original Snow White, the queen was her biological mother.

549
00:38:57,511 --> 00:39:00,611
She still wanted to kill her own daughter.

550
00:39:00,611 --> 00:39:03,331
Why do you think she did that?

551
00:39:03,331 --> 00:39:04,971
Jealousy.

552
00:39:04,971 --> 00:39:08,511
She hated that her daughter was becoming a woman.

553
00:39:08,511 --> 00:39:12,041
What are you talking about? What kind of mother is like that?

554
00:39:12,041 --> 00:39:14,161
If you're going to talk nonsense, go to your room.

555
00:39:14,161 --> 00:39:16,211
Just go!

556
00:39:27,981 --> 00:39:29,721
- Hello.
 - Hello.

557
00:39:29,721 --> 00:39:31,461
Hello.

558
00:39:31,461 --> 00:39:34,701
Hi, good morning.

559
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:37,971
Let go.

560
00:39:37,971 --> 00:39:39,661
I'll carry it for you.

561
00:39:39,661 --> 00:39:41,711
I told you it's fine!

562
00:39:43,301 --> 00:39:45,931
Whoa, what is that?

563
00:39:45,931 --> 00:39:48,281
Hey, what are these?

564
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:53,520
 For educational purposes

565
00:39:53,521 --> 00:39:56,481
I thought you should know, ma'am.

566
00:39:56,481 --> 00:40:00,101
It happened in public, so...

567
00:40:00,101 --> 00:40:03,361
I don't know what to tell you.

568
00:40:03,361 --> 00:40:06,621
Yu Jin has always been a curious child.

569
00:40:06,621 --> 00:40:10,061
You must know as an educator.

570
00:40:10,061 --> 00:40:14,131
Education can't change the traits you inherit.

571
00:40:14,131 --> 00:40:19,401
You know that her mother had an affair with a younger man, right?

572
00:40:19,401 --> 00:40:20,871
Mom!

573
00:40:21,781 --> 00:40:24,121
What did you just say?

574
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:26,951
How dare you interrupt when adults are talking?

575
00:40:26,951 --> 00:40:28,631
Those aren't even mine!

576
00:40:28,631 --> 00:40:30,731
Teacher, they're hers.

577
00:40:30,731 --> 00:40:32,931
She stole them during the sex education class!

578
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,661
That's not true!

579
00:40:34,661 --> 00:40:37,711
What are you saying? You told me to do it.

580
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:42,541
I did steal them, but I gave them all to her.

581
00:40:42,541 --> 00:40:44,281
You said you needed them!

582
00:40:44,281 --> 00:40:46,431
- When did I say that?
 - Quiet, quiet!

583
00:40:46,431 --> 00:40:47,931
Go write your letter of apology.

584
00:40:47,931 --> 00:40:50,031
Stay around after class.

585
00:40:59,551 --> 00:41:01,491
Why did you lie?

586
00:41:01,491 --> 00:41:04,271
It's true that you stole them.

587
00:41:05,271 --> 00:41:08,581
Is it because of what my mom said?

588
00:41:08,581 --> 00:41:10,481
You know Mom just says whatever she wants.

589
00:41:10,481 --> 00:41:12,521
I have to listen to it every day.

590
00:41:12,521 --> 00:41:16,721
Or are you mad that Mom took my side?

591
00:41:19,231 --> 00:41:22,851
Hey. This is insane.

592
00:41:22,851 --> 00:41:24,671
Who says I'm jealous of that?

593
00:41:24,671 --> 00:41:26,611
I don't need a mom like that.

594
00:41:26,611 --> 00:41:28,351
I wouldn't even want her if she was hand-delivered to me!

595
00:41:28,351 --> 00:41:30,731
What? A mom like that?

596
00:41:30,731 --> 00:41:33,441
Yeah. She's tacky and out of touch,

597
00:41:33,441 --> 00:41:36,221
and she sucks the air out of everyone around her.

598
00:41:36,221 --> 00:41:39,021
My dad will probably get sick of her and run off, just like your dad did.

599
00:41:39,021 --> 00:41:42,381
Hey! Your mom's the one who cheated!

600
00:41:42,381 --> 00:41:44,091
You...

601
00:41:44,091 --> 00:41:45,781
Hey.

602
00:42:05,441 --> 00:42:08,741
 The crack got bigger and bigger

603
00:42:08,741 --> 00:42:10,981
 until the two of us finally crumbled.

604
00:42:10,981 --> 00:42:13,451
Go away! How dare you come in here!

605
00:42:13,451 --> 00:42:16,131
Calm down, calm down.

606
00:42:16,131 --> 00:42:19,181
I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill your daughter!

607
00:42:19,181 --> 00:42:21,081
Yu Jin, stop.

608
00:42:29,961 --> 00:42:31,811
Stop it.

609
00:43:15,371 --> 00:43:17,401
So close.

610
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:25,730
 Wisely, Beautifully, Sincerely

611
00:43:25,731 --> 00:43:28,651
- Hello. 
- Hi.

612
00:43:30,051 --> 00:43:31,401
Who is Jang Mi Ho?

613
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:33,001
Jang Mi Ho?

614
00:43:33,001 --> 00:43:34,721
 Tacky Jang Mi Ho?

615
00:43:34,721 --> 00:43:36,071
 Who knew?

616
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:39,001
- Hey, it's Jang Mi Ho!
 - This is real garbage.

617
00:43:42,641 --> 00:43:46,041
 Exposing the real Jang Mi Ho, Second Year, Class 12.

618
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:49,861
 Jang Mi Ho has been pretending to be a model student, fooling everyone.

619
00:43:49,861 --> 00:43:53,231
 The reality is that she is evil. She planned the condom incident.

620
00:43:53,231 --> 00:43:54,681
 She framed me.

621
00:43:54,681 --> 00:43:57,851
 But the most disgusting thing is that Jang Mi Ho tried to seduce her stepfather.

622
00:43:57,851 --> 00:43:59,521
 I cannot forgive Jang Mi Ho.

623
00:43:59,521 --> 00:44:01,091
 Rather than be blamed for something I didn't do...

624
00:44:01,091 --> 00:44:02,081
 She pretends to be all pure, but...

625
00:44:02,081 --> 00:44:05,181
 I would rather die than to be falsely accused.

626
00:44:05,181 --> 00:44:08,221
 Second Year, Class 7, Oh Yu Jin.

627
00:44:08,221 --> 00:44:11,211
Oh Yu Jin! Where is Oh Yu Jin?

628
00:44:12,641 --> 00:44:13,841
 Over there, over there.

629
00:44:13,841 --> 00:44:15,791
 What is it?

630
00:44:18,591 --> 00:44:20,861
Get down. Get down now!

631
00:44:20,861 --> 00:44:23,381
Admit what you did.

632
00:44:23,381 --> 00:44:26,081
Say what I wrote down there is true.

633
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:29,441
Those are all lies, you crazy bitch.

634
00:44:31,651 --> 00:44:35,471
Yu Jin! Please, please! Don't do it!

635
00:44:35,471 --> 00:44:37,911
Say it! Say they're true!

636
00:44:38,901 --> 00:44:40,481
Why are you doing this to me?

637
00:44:40,481 --> 00:44:43,351
You're the one who tried to kill me!

638
00:44:43,351 --> 00:44:45,751
Please!

639
00:44:45,751 --> 00:44:48,661
Don't do it, Yu Jin.

640
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:57,801
You're right. You are right about everything.

641
00:45:00,101 --> 00:45:02,501
I'm the black sheep.

642
00:45:02,501 --> 00:45:07,111
I'm the one who bled because of the shitty things you and your mother did.

643
00:45:07,111 --> 00:45:09,151
Disgusting bitch.

644
00:45:10,161 --> 00:45:13,531
You and your bitch of a mother are the same.

645
00:45:13,531 --> 00:45:16,311
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

646
00:45:16,311 --> 00:45:20,071
It's my fault. So, please come down.

647
00:45:20,071 --> 00:45:21,781
Oh Yu Jin!

648
00:45:30,701 --> 00:45:33,391
 Why did I not know anything?

649
00:45:33,391 --> 00:45:36,171
Honey, honey!

650
00:45:36,171 --> 00:45:38,061
Open the door.

651
00:45:38,971 --> 00:45:42,011
Honey, how long are you going to do this?

652
00:45:42,011 --> 00:45:43,891
 I can't fail at a second marriage.

653
00:45:43,891 --> 00:45:46,481
 That's the same for you!

654
00:45:47,731 --> 00:45:49,181
 Honey...

655
00:45:50,201 --> 00:45:52,071
Seriously...

656
00:45:52,071 --> 00:45:55,241
Rumors are rumors, but this one is ugly.

657
00:45:55,241 --> 00:45:58,851
Well, there's no smoke without fire.

658
00:46:06,981 --> 00:46:09,331

Honey, please open the door...

659
00:46:09,331 --> 00:46:11,481
 Honey, please...

660
00:46:14,191 --> 00:46:16,771
 Honey, Honey...

661
00:46:17,751 --> 00:46:20,311
 Or did I pretend not to know?

662
00:46:25,381 --> 00:46:29,861
Yu Jin's dad woke up in the hospital.

663
00:46:31,171 --> 00:46:35,191
I don't know if he'll be able to live a normal life again,

664
00:46:36,641 --> 00:46:39,771
but we decided not to take any legal action.

665
00:46:42,471 --> 00:46:46,401
No need for the world to know my second marriage failed.

666
00:46:49,841 --> 00:46:52,031
You know this is your fault, right?

667
00:46:54,271 --> 00:46:55,631
I'm sorry.

668
00:46:55,631 --> 00:46:57,331
Because of you—

669
00:47:01,071 --> 00:47:04,101
Atone your entire life for this.

670
00:47:04,101 --> 00:47:07,471
You're a sinner to me.

671
00:47:53,721 --> 00:47:57,671
 The wound was closed by force of will, and it looked like it was healing.

672
00:48:10,061 --> 00:48:11,901
Hello.

673
00:48:11,901 --> 00:48:15,851
Could I get one, no, two copies of a family relationship certificate?

674
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:17,601
- Just a moment.
 - Okay.

675
00:48:20,199 --> 00:48:23,331
 Congratulations! You've been hired. Please bring a family relationship certificate, a bank statement...

676
00:48:27,101 --> 00:48:29,301
Thank you.

677
00:48:34,501 --> 00:48:38,681
 Father: Oh Joong Geun / Mother: Im Gang Sook / Child: Oh Yu Jin

678
00:48:38,681 --> 00:48:40,081
 Child: Oh Yu Jin

679
00:48:43,411 --> 00:48:45,001
 Family Relationship Certificate

680
00:49:08,251 --> 00:49:13,201
 Why didn't I know anything?

681
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,701
 Before she got married, she shamelessly showed her face.

682
00:49:16,701 --> 00:49:19,521
 Now you're stuck with her kids?

683
00:49:19,521 --> 00:49:22,081
 This time, she's a real auntie.

684
00:49:30,251 --> 00:49:31,811
 Wait!

685
00:49:34,431 --> 00:49:36,311
 We need to talk.

686
00:49:40,331 --> 00:49:45,391
 So, if you don't want everything you did in the past exposed, shut your mouth.

687
00:49:51,011 --> 00:49:53,781
 Why didn't I know anything?

688
00:49:55,531 --> 00:49:58,031
 Or was I pretending?

689
00:50:12,661 --> 00:50:14,621
No!

690
00:50:14,621 --> 00:50:16,631
No!

691
00:50:16,631 --> 00:50:18,481
No! I don't want to!

692
00:50:18,481 --> 00:50:20,311
I don't know why they're like this today.

693
00:50:20,311 --> 00:50:22,321
Let's go. You're putting your teacher in a tough spot.

694
00:50:22,321 --> 00:50:24,641
I don't want to! No!

695
00:50:24,641 --> 00:50:26,901
I don't want to!

696
00:50:28,801 --> 00:50:31,061
Bye. Ji Yool, let's go.

697
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:33,381
No!

698
00:50:33,381 --> 00:50:35,581
No!

699
00:50:45,781 --> 00:50:47,961
Do you hate me? You don't want to go?

700
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:50,471
I don't want to! I hate you!

701
00:50:50,471 --> 00:50:53,281
You hate me? Fine, do whatever you want.

702
00:50:53,281 --> 00:50:56,121
Come home or not. Follow the teacher or whatever.

703
00:51:02,041 --> 00:51:04,771
Are you going to abandon us too, Auntie?

704
00:51:11,471 --> 00:51:14,771
You're going to abandon us too, aren't you?

705
00:51:19,661 --> 00:51:21,691
 Didn't I tell you?

706
00:51:21,691 --> 00:51:25,501
 She came to me once before she got married and after she had her kids.

707
00:51:25,501 --> 00:51:27,361
 She was looking for you.

708
00:51:34,621 --> 00:51:36,261
 We have lots of aunties.

709
00:51:36,261 --> 00:51:38,061
 This time, she's a real auntie.

710
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:39,911
 Real Auntie?

711
00:51:39,911 --> 00:51:42,041
 All the other aunties are fake, but

712
00:51:42,041 --> 00:51:44,641
 Auntie Mi Ho is your real aunt.

713
00:53:44,731 --> 00:53:47,291
Why did you look for me?

714
00:53:49,551 --> 00:53:52,201
What did you want to say?

715
00:55:02,921 --> 00:55:04,911
 Bye!

716
00:55:07,131 --> 00:55:08,921
 Kang Bong Seok (Yu Jin's father-in-law)

717
00:55:09,571 --> 00:55:12,661
Hello, Mr. Kang. Did you see my text?

718
00:55:12,661 --> 00:55:15,591
I wanted to watch the kids for the days I took off from work.

719
00:55:15,591 --> 00:55:18,521
It's all good. Thank you.

720
00:55:19,051 --> 00:55:21,261
Hello!

721
00:55:21,261 --> 00:55:23,501
Excuse me.

722
00:55:23,501 --> 00:55:26,251
I guess you didn't come with Song Jeong Ah today.

723
00:55:26,251 --> 00:55:28,371
Why are you looking for Jeong Ah?

724
00:55:28,371 --> 00:55:30,991
I wanted to have brunch together.

725
00:55:30,991 --> 00:55:33,621
I have some questions about Yu Jin.

726
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:37,501
I thought she might know best what Yu Jin's time here was like.

727
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:39,191
Brunch?

728
00:55:40,291 --> 00:55:41,801
Now?

729
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:45,311
Moving forward, I don't think there will be brunch.

730
00:55:45,311 --> 00:55:47,081
See you later.

731
00:55:50,821 --> 00:55:53,181
 Like you said, she was shameless.

732
00:55:53,181 --> 00:55:54,801
 She's definitely guilty of something.

733
00:55:54,801 --> 00:55:57,101
So what did you tell her? Did you say I'll go to brunch?

734
00:55:57,101 --> 00:55:59,921
 Are you crazy? We've known Na Yeong for years.

735
00:55:59,921 --> 00:56:02,901
Good. Let's keep doing that.

736
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:07,631
We owe it to Na Yeong to not talk to that woman.

737
00:56:07,631 --> 00:56:10,571
Oh, when was Seong Hui going to visit today?

738
00:56:10,571 --> 00:56:12,131
I think she already left.

739
00:56:12,131 --> 00:56:15,471
She said she'd drop by with the principal and the teachers who are off today.

740
00:56:15,471 --> 00:56:18,321
Who's off today?

741
00:56:19,941 --> 00:56:21,521
What?

742
00:56:41,591 --> 00:56:43,481
 You have a new message

743
00:56:47,831 --> 00:56:50,061
How come you're outside?

744
00:56:50,061 --> 00:56:53,091
- Mommy!
 - Ah Rin!

745
00:57:17,171 --> 00:57:18,591
 Let's trade.

746
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:20,761
 I'll give you what you want.

747
00:57:20,761 --> 00:57:24,341
 At 11 p.m. Underground parking level 3, area A.

748
00:57:24,341 --> 00:57:28,861
 Don't forget the USB.

 Hello!

00:58:24,181 --> 00:58:27,811
 Is it because we have an unexpected guest?

 Even Song Jeong Ah can't handle Lim Da Eun.

 Stupid, it wasn't a sparkly jewel. It was a USB.

 Does she know?

767
00:58:37,871 --> 00:58:43,461
 The three of you, including Na Yeong, were quite intense before she died.

 Are you going to accuse me of murdering Oh Yu Jin?

773

 You think I'd sit back when someone classless like you is creating a ruckus?

 Shut your mouth and get lost quietly.
