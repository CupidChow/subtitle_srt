Look at these girls. Aren't you two going to say hi?

16
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:27,147
You will be living together from now on, so you should become friends.

17
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,617
Hi.

18
00:02:28,617 --> 00:02:32,147
I am Jang Mi Ho of 4th grade, Class 7.

19
00:02:32,147 --> 00:02:34,937
I am Oh Yu Jin of 4th grade, Class 11.

20
00:02:34,937 --> 00:02:37,417
Yu Jin, what month is your birthday?

21
00:02:37,417 --> 00:02:39,427
May.

22
00:02:39,427 --> 00:02:42,437
Ah, so you are the eonni, Yu Jin.

23
00:02:42,437 --> 00:02:45,337
Mi Ho, try calling her Eonni.

24
00:02:49,727 --> 00:02:51,837
Gosh, don't push her so much.

25
00:02:51,837 --> 00:02:53,337
They'll grow close over time.

26
00:02:53,337 --> 00:02:55,187
Oh, yes.

27
00:03:09,187 --> 00:03:12,787
 Now I— I know we're not in Kansas. 

28
00:03:14,547 --> 00:03:17,637
 Are you a good witch or a bad witch? 

29
00:03:18,707 --> 00:03:20,667
Oh, right.

30
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,747
I should go and do my homework.

31
00:03:22,747 --> 00:03:25,837
 I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas. 

32
00:03:25,837 --> 00:03:28,767
 But is that a witch? 

33
00:03:43,977 --> 00:03:46,627
- What are you doing?
- It's nothing.

34
00:03:48,157 --> 00:03:50,787
Do you get in trouble for getting just two wrong?

35
00:03:50,787 --> 00:03:53,257
What does that have to do with you?

36
00:03:55,177 --> 00:03:57,687
Do you want to switch with me?

37
00:03:57,687 --> 00:03:59,687
Forget it.

38
00:03:59,687 --> 00:04:02,437
 Jang Mi Ho - 100% 

39
00:04:06,117 --> 00:04:07,557
You did well.

40
00:04:07,557 --> 00:04:11,097
As expected, you don't disappoint me, my daughter.

41
00:04:11,097 --> 00:04:15,427
What about Yu Jin's? Shall I see what you got, Yu Jin?

42
00:04:15,427 --> 00:04:17,357
I threw away my exam.

43
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:18,977
I'll be going to the market!

44
00:04:18,977 --> 00:04:21,707
M-Me too. I'll go with her.

45
00:04:22,717 --> 00:04:25,867
Hey! Wait for me!

46
00:04:26,587 --> 00:04:29,327
Hey, I said, let's go together!

47
00:04:30,977 --> 00:04:32,937
But why don't you call me Eonni?

48
00:04:32,937 --> 00:04:36,027
We're the same age, so why would I call you Eonni?

49
00:04:36,027 --> 00:04:37,987
You're right...

50
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:40,847
Then call me whatever you want.

51
00:04:58,527 --> 00:05:00,247
Eonni!

52
00:05:02,377 --> 00:05:04,837
Is it like this or like this?

53
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:07,777
You don't even know how to put on shoes by yourself?

54
00:05:07,777 --> 00:05:09,747
Oh, right.

55
00:05:15,487 --> 00:05:18,947
Can you give her a jjong-jjong hairstyle?

56
00:05:18,947 --> 00:05:20,907
What is that?

57
00:05:20,907 --> 00:05:23,797
Jjong-jjong hairstyle, jjong-jjong hairstyle.

58
00:05:23,797 --> 00:05:25,427
So what is that?

59
00:05:25,427 --> 00:05:28,597
I have to know what that is for me to do it for you.

60
00:05:28,597 --> 00:05:29,967
Dummy.

61
00:05:29,967 --> 00:05:33,407
Only Mommy knows how to do a jjong-jjong hairstyle.

62
00:05:36,427 --> 00:05:39,717
Give her a jjong-jjong hairstyle!

63
00:05:50,737 --> 00:05:52,507
Eonni!

64
00:05:53,747 --> 00:05:58,677
I feel so bad for Yu Jin. What do we do?

65
00:05:58,677 --> 00:06:00,387
I'm sure she went to a good place.

66
00:06:00,387 --> 00:06:02,417
Let's think of it that way.

67
00:06:47,487 --> 00:06:51,617
We're mothers from the same kindergarten as Yu Jin's kids.

68
00:06:52,527 --> 00:06:56,167
This must be so heartbreaking for you.

69
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:58,607
Our hearts are breaking as well.

70
00:06:58,607 --> 00:07:01,987
Thank you for coming.

71
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,467
But still, a lot of people came.

72
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:16,057
I worried that there wouldn't be many people to keep it quiet.

73
00:07:16,057 --> 00:07:19,657
How could they keep it quiet when the news has spread like that?

74
00:07:19,657 --> 00:07:22,677
But who is that woman sitting with the bereaved family?

75
00:07:22,677 --> 00:07:24,977
I heard she's Yu Jin's sister.

76
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:27,357
I'm not sure if she is the older sister or the younger one.

77
00:07:27,357 --> 00:07:29,367
 - Are you her friend?
- No. 

78
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:33,547
 Oh Yu Jin won our bank's family photo event. 

79
00:07:33,547 --> 00:07:35,707
 I came to propose an ad deal. 

80
00:07:35,707 --> 00:07:38,377
What do you mean she's her sister?

81
00:07:38,377 --> 00:07:40,647
She's her step-sister from a remarriage.

82
00:07:40,647 --> 00:07:44,047
But when their parents separated, they didn't separate legally.

83
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,367
It appears Yu Jin's father-in-law just found out because of her death.

84
00:07:46,367 --> 00:07:49,677
But where are her parents that her step-sister is over there?

85
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:53,267
Her biological mother cut off all contact after she got remarried,

86
00:07:53,267 --> 00:07:55,517
and her father passed away.

87
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,607
I noticed earlier that...

88
00:07:57,607 --> 00:08:01,117
Yu Jin's father-in-law asked her to join him because it may seem too empty.

89
00:08:01,117 --> 00:08:05,167
Gosh, I hope the children's father wakes up soon.

90
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,877
What's going to happen to the kids?

91
00:08:08,877 --> 00:08:10,967
With their mom dying like that,

92
00:08:10,967 --> 00:08:14,727
they'll be so shocked when they find out later once they grow up.

93
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:17,637
Gosh, it breaks my heart.

94
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,470
 @somin.ing 

95
00:08:24,477 --> 00:08:26,817
 My last photo with her... 

96
00:08:26,817 --> 00:08:29,937
 I will remember you forever— 

97
00:08:29,937 --> 00:08:31,637
What are you doing on a day like this?

98
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:33,457
Everyone, go home.

99
00:08:47,147 --> 00:08:50,867
She did come in the end. I guess she felt guilty.

100
00:08:53,817 --> 00:08:55,417
Like this?

101
00:08:55,417 --> 00:08:57,387
No, it's not.

102
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:00,347
I'll do it for you later.

103
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:17,477
- Oh.
 - Deputy-- I mean General Manager...

104
00:09:17,477 --> 00:09:19,227
General Manager Hwang.

105
00:09:23,427 --> 00:09:25,117
Please eat before you go.

106
00:09:25,117 --> 00:09:28,307
No, I'm fine. I was going to pay my respects and go.

107
00:09:36,727 --> 00:09:40,127
- You're the same as always. 
- What?

108
00:09:40,127 --> 00:09:42,327
Me living so frantically?

109
00:09:42,327 --> 00:09:44,187
That's me.

110
00:09:45,357 --> 00:09:49,117
But... What a small world.

111
00:09:49,117 --> 00:09:53,147
I wouldn't have dreamed that you were Yu Jin's sister.

112
00:09:53,147 --> 00:09:56,517
You didn't mention that while we worked at the branch together.

113
00:09:56,517 --> 00:10:00,157
That wasn't something to tell everyone about.

114
00:10:01,377 --> 00:10:04,937
With that said, about today...

115
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,607
Oh, okay.

116
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:09,297
Yeah, I'll keep it a secret.

117
00:10:09,297 --> 00:10:10,787
Thank you.

118
00:10:11,687 --> 00:10:13,867
It's not like it's a typical funeral, either.

119
00:10:16,307 --> 00:10:19,667
No one else at our company knows besides me?

120
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:22,817
Well, apart from my subordinate, yeah.

121
00:10:22,817 --> 00:10:25,487
I used a PTO day for today.

122
00:10:28,947 --> 00:10:31,767
What do the police say?

123
00:10:31,767 --> 00:10:35,427
Do they think it's really murder, and are there any suspects?

124
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:38,087
I don't know why the police are being so secretive in their investigation.

125
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:41,087
That's why the rumors are getting scarier and scarier.

126
00:10:41,087 --> 00:10:44,207
Well, I don't know, either.

127
00:10:45,007 --> 00:10:47,297
My So Won must be waiting for me.

128
00:10:50,707 --> 00:10:53,087
How about those young children.

129
00:10:58,197 --> 00:10:59,997
I know.

130
00:10:59,997 --> 00:11:02,127
Oh, I'm really late.

131
00:11:02,127 --> 00:11:04,167
It's kind of sad we met like this. I'll be going.

132
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:06,207
Goodbye.

133
00:11:09,447 --> 00:11:13,377
But are you okay?

134
00:11:23,597 --> 00:11:26,507
The culprit will be caught soon.

135
00:11:26,507 --> 00:11:28,747
You should also take care of yourself.

136
00:11:29,417 --> 00:11:30,737
Okay.

137
00:12:44,117 --> 00:12:46,507
I'll be going now.

138
00:12:46,507 --> 00:12:49,667
Wait, can we talk for a bit?

139
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:52,997
It's not for a long time. I'm only asking you for a month or two.

140
00:12:52,997 --> 00:12:54,627
Even if the children's dad wakes up,

141
00:12:54,627 --> 00:12:58,007
he will have to stay in the hospital for a while.

142
00:12:58,007 --> 00:13:01,557
I'm sorry, but I also have a job.

143
00:13:01,557 --> 00:13:04,047
One or two months isn't a short period of time,

144
00:13:04,047 --> 00:13:05,617
and the babysitter is there, too.

145
00:13:05,617 --> 00:13:08,257
She will only stay until this week.

146
00:13:08,257 --> 00:13:11,997
And it's not easy to find someone who will take care of the kids full-time.

147
00:13:11,997 --> 00:13:14,387
In any case,

148
00:13:14,387 --> 00:13:16,877
how could it be better than a blood relative?

149
00:13:19,107 --> 00:13:22,137
I'm not a blood relative.

150
00:13:22,137 --> 00:13:25,247
I believe I've fulfilled all my duties and responsibilities as of today.

151
00:13:25,247 --> 00:13:26,647
Hey, look here.

152
00:13:26,647 --> 00:13:28,597
Don't you even feel bad for the kids?

153
00:13:28,597 --> 00:13:30,637
I do feel bad for them.

154
00:13:30,637 --> 00:13:34,457
But if I start this out of careless duty and pity,

155
00:13:34,457 --> 00:13:39,287
and later give up, you'd be in a difficult situation, too.

156
00:13:39,287 --> 00:13:43,687
If so, I feel it's better to tell you upfront that I can't do it.

157
00:13:43,687 --> 00:13:46,297
And I don't like kids anyway.

158
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:58,027
If we're done talking, I'll be going.

159
00:14:24,277 --> 00:14:26,847
Did Real Auntie leave?

160
00:14:26,847 --> 00:14:28,337
Yeah.

161
00:14:30,847 --> 00:14:33,267
 Hey, Sad Seob. I heard that Assistant Manager Jang in your section 

162
00:14:33,267 --> 00:14:35,187
 is a suspect in the Bannae-dong murder case. 

163
00:14:35,187 --> 00:14:36,177
 Is that true? 

164
00:14:36,177 --> 00:14:38,297
 What are you saying? Who said that? 

165
00:14:38,297 --> 00:14:40,757
 I heard detectives came to the office a few times. 

166
00:14:42,377 --> 00:14:43,887
 I mean— 

167
00:15:03,257 --> 00:15:04,647
 Even her messenger is offline. 

168
00:15:04,647 --> 00:15:07,987
 Daebak. Maybe she got arrested and is being interrogated. 

169
00:15:07,987 --> 00:15:09,777
 Hey, if you don't know anything, just be quiet. 

170
00:15:09,777 --> 00:15:11,667
 My boss was the victim's sister, 

171
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:13,547
 so she used a PTO day today to go to her funeral. 

172
00:15:13,547 --> 00:15:15,107
 You don't even know anything. 

173
00:15:15,107 --> 00:15:17,737
 Sister? Daebak, this is crazy. 

174
00:15:17,737 --> 00:15:20,717
 This could be a case of murder over an inheritance. 

175
00:15:20,717 --> 00:15:22,717
 Hey, don't you dare run your mouth carelessly. 

176
00:15:22,717 --> 00:15:25,437
 My boss would never do that. 

177
00:15:25,437 --> 00:15:28,437
 If you spread false rumors, you're dead! 

178
00:15:31,857 --> 00:15:33,797
Gosh, I'm so tired.

179
00:15:36,807 --> 00:15:38,427
All the bloodstains were a smeared mess,

180
00:15:38,427 --> 00:15:41,087
and the only eyewitness is unconscious.

181
00:15:41,087 --> 00:15:44,917
We are working so hard, and yet it's difficult to picture what happened.

182
00:15:44,917 --> 00:15:47,117
Oh, she's here.

183
00:15:48,817 --> 00:15:51,147
Wasn't the information I gave you at the office enough?

184
00:15:51,147 --> 00:15:52,527
You already checked everything.

185
00:15:52,527 --> 00:15:54,757
We're just trying to check the details

186
00:15:54,757 --> 00:15:58,377
of what happened that day from various angles.

187
00:15:58,377 --> 00:16:01,377
If you are looking for people with hostility toward her, look elsewhere.

188
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,897
I have no reason to harm her after 18 years.

189
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,787
Just a moment, Jang Mi Ho.

190
00:16:06,787 --> 00:16:08,537
Do you remember

191
00:16:08,537 --> 00:16:11,797
what Oh Yu Jin said in her last phone call with you?

192
00:16:18,317 --> 00:16:19,447
 Please input the passcode. 

193
00:16:19,447 --> 00:16:22,087
 The door is open. 

194
00:16:24,127 --> 00:16:28,867
 It's kind of hard to say it's my first time cooking, 

195
00:16:28,867 --> 00:16:32,907
 I didn't study it particularly. I studied something totally different. 

196
00:16:32,907 --> 00:16:35,587
 Regarding running a restaurant... 

197
00:16:35,587 --> 00:16:38,337
 Yes, since running a restaurant is different from cooking. 

198
00:16:38,337 --> 00:16:43,457
 I did help acquaintances create menus for their restaurants as a hobby. 

199
00:16:43,457 --> 00:16:45,567
 That's really good. 

200
00:16:49,737 --> 00:16:53,387
 The investigation of the murder of 30-something-year-old A at a luxury apartment in Seoul 

201
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:56,307
 is still unsolved as a mystery. 

202
00:16:56,307 --> 00:17:00,167
 At H Apartment in Bannae-dong on the 5th around 9 p.m.... 

203
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:02,067
 Oh Yu Jin 

204
00:17:03,637 --> 00:17:05,757
 ...help me. 

205
00:17:05,757 --> 00:17:07,477
Help me?

206
00:17:08,407 --> 00:17:09,707
Save me?

207
00:17:09,707 --> 00:17:11,887
 You... know... the number... 

208
00:17:13,027 --> 00:17:15,157
 Come... 

209
00:17:16,057 --> 00:17:18,987
Gosh, what was she talking about?

210
00:17:18,987 --> 00:17:21,997
 A was found dead on the balcony, 

211
00:17:21,997 --> 00:17:25,507
 and her husband, B was transported to the hospital with stab wounds. 

212
00:17:31,597 --> 00:17:35,267
 Even though my husband came home from work late last night, he plays with our daughters. 

213
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:37,727
 He's not letting me out of the cabana. 

214
00:17:37,727 --> 00:17:39,607
 You're doing a lot. Pat, pat. 

215
00:17:39,607 --> 00:17:41,587
 Yool's Mom, I'm so jealous. 

216
00:17:41,587 --> 00:17:45,147
 Yool's Mom, how did you get the collaboration beach bag? 

217
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,927
 There are three snakes living in a house. 

218
00:17:48,747 --> 00:17:52,137
 Daddy Snake, Daddy Snake, Daddy Snake. 

219
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:56,167
 Daddy Snake is a crazy bastard, Mommy Snake is a crazy bitch, 

220
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:58,497
 Mommy Snake has lost her mind  

221
00:18:00,937 --> 00:18:03,897
 Na Yeong 

222
00:18:16,657 --> 00:18:18,617
What is this?

223
00:18:18,617 --> 00:18:20,867
Were they not on good terms?

224
00:18:27,947 --> 00:18:30,957
- Ah Rin!
 - Min Seong!

225
00:18:30,957 --> 00:18:32,987
Ji Yool didn't come out yet?

226
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,777
Yeah, I don't think so.

227
00:18:38,157 --> 00:18:39,527
Stop stressing me out.

228
00:18:39,527 --> 00:18:41,627
Will you cause all the moms to talk about this?

229
00:18:41,627 --> 00:18:43,627
How are you so unfazed by this?

230
00:18:43,627 --> 00:18:45,427
What do you mean I'm not affected?

231
00:18:45,427 --> 00:18:48,667
I am sad and heartbroken by this as much as you.

232
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:51,307
It's not our fault. Just keep your mouth shut.

233
00:18:51,307 --> 00:18:54,757
Don't make this a bigger deal with your ridiculous guilt.

234
00:18:54,757 --> 00:18:56,907
Still, what about Ji Yool? What about the kids?

235
00:18:56,907 --> 00:19:00,617
I have a plan, so straighten out your face.

236
00:19:00,617 --> 00:19:02,167
I don't want to go down for this.

237
00:19:02,167 --> 00:19:04,287
Help me out with this.

238
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,807
Eonni!

239
00:19:11,877 --> 00:19:16,437
By chance, there isn't something I don't know about, is there?

240
00:19:30,797 --> 00:19:32,437
How about you?

241
00:19:51,437 --> 00:19:52,877
Let's go, Ah Rin.

242
00:19:52,877 --> 00:19:54,967
Good morning! Hello.

243
00:19:54,967 --> 00:19:56,667
Good morning!

244
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:59,217
Good morning, Jaden and Chloe!

245
00:19:59,217 --> 00:20:01,557
- You brought it.
 - We're going to plant this today.

246
00:20:01,557 --> 00:20:04,437
Who else takes care of Ji Yool and Ha Yool apart from me?

247
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:07,117
You will come with the kids, right, Ms. Jo?

248
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:10,797
Oh, of course.

249
00:20:10,797 --> 00:20:13,297
Since there's still some time left.

250
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:15,907
Oh, could you bring a marker?

251
00:20:15,907 --> 00:20:18,477
- Also, bring shovels and gloves. 
- Okay.

252
00:20:19,987 --> 00:20:22,557
Oh, my, hello.

253
00:20:22,557 --> 00:20:24,657
Ji Yool and Ha Yool, you're here!

254
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:27,307
Oh, my pretty babies.

255
00:20:28,277 --> 00:20:30,177
 Hello... 

256
00:20:30,177 --> 00:20:32,487
It so happens I was waiting for you.

257
00:20:32,487 --> 00:20:34,460
We'll plant a tree for your mom.

258
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:37,037
You will come, too, right, Ji Yool and Ha Yool?

259
00:20:37,037 --> 00:20:40,927
Let's plant the tree and go somewhere fun with me later, okay?

260
00:20:40,927 --> 00:20:43,807
- Okay.
 - Okay.

261
00:20:44,947 --> 00:20:47,297
You should come with us, ma'am.

262
00:20:50,137 --> 00:20:51,907
 Remembrance Tree 

263
00:20:51,907 --> 00:20:54,517
You have such pretty handwriting.

264
00:20:54,517 --> 00:20:58,487
Yu Jin would be so happy watching from Heaven.

265
00:21:00,077 --> 00:21:02,077
It's all finished.

266
00:21:02,077 --> 00:21:03,937
You're good at this.

267
00:21:03,937 --> 00:21:06,137
Then shall we plant it?

268
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:21,357
You're good at everything, Ms. Jo.

269
00:21:21,357 --> 00:21:23,847
I've done this a lot with the kids.

270
00:21:25,547 --> 00:21:27,637
I think this should be deep enough.

271
00:21:27,637 --> 00:21:29,587
Could you give me the sapling?

272
00:21:29,587 --> 00:21:33,127
Wait, we should have Ji Yool and Ha Yool do the planting.

273
00:21:33,127 --> 00:21:35,327
Ji Yool and Ha Yool!

274
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,837
Ji Yool and Ha Yool, come here!

275
00:21:38,887 --> 00:21:40,337
Come here!

276
00:21:45,047 --> 00:21:47,477
Could you finish the planting with the kids?

277
00:21:47,477 --> 00:21:50,767
I think the finishing touches should be done by someone who's good at it.

278
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:53,127
Of course, I should do it.

279
00:21:56,777 --> 00:21:58,667
The tree we're planting today

280
00:21:58,667 --> 00:22:02,317
is to remember your mom, Ji Yool and Ha Yool.

281
00:22:02,317 --> 00:22:05,157
Let's remember your mom who went to heaven first

282
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:09,037
whenever we look at this tree, Ji Yool and Ha Yool.

283
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:11,277
Oh, we finished right before class started.

284
00:22:11,277 --> 00:22:13,207
Great work, Ms. Jo.

285
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:17,117
You're so good at planting a tree with care and detail.

286
00:22:17,117 --> 00:22:20,747
I don't even worry about my Min Seong, thanks to you, Ms. Jo.

287
00:22:20,747 --> 00:22:22,907
This is for Ji Yool and Ha Yool's mother.

288
00:22:22,907 --> 00:22:24,427
Of course, I should help.

289
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:27,787
Children, let's go inside.

290
00:22:28,697 --> 00:22:30,407
Excuse me, ma'am.

291
00:22:31,447 --> 00:22:33,687
Let's have a brief chat.

292
00:22:39,267 --> 00:22:41,257
Don't even get me started.

293
00:22:41,257 --> 00:22:44,257
The children's father is still unconscious.

294
00:22:44,257 --> 00:22:47,207
The grandfather is going back and forth from the hospital and the house

295
00:22:47,207 --> 00:22:50,357
that I am always leaving past the time I'm supposed to leave work!

296
00:22:50,357 --> 00:22:53,147
You're going through a lot, ma'am.

297
00:22:53,147 --> 00:22:57,397
Then, will you keep taking care of the kids?

298
00:22:57,397 --> 00:23:01,537
I mean, it was supposed to be only up to this week,

299
00:23:02,477 --> 00:23:05,347
but their actual aunt bluntly refused

300
00:23:05,347 --> 00:23:09,807
and that grandfather can't ever watch the kids by himself.

301
00:23:09,807 --> 00:23:12,747
It's a dilemma for me, too.

302
00:23:14,257 --> 00:23:17,017
Why would you worry about something like that when we're here?

303
00:23:17,017 --> 00:23:19,837
Do you know how close I was with their mom?

304
00:23:19,837 --> 00:23:22,257
I'm pretty much like an aunt to them.

305
00:23:22,257 --> 00:23:24,737
And since we have our own babysitter,

306
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:28,067
it's not that difficult to watch a couple of kids.

307
00:23:28,067 --> 00:23:29,667
But still...

308
00:23:29,667 --> 00:23:34,037
More importantly, a mom I know in Gyepo-dong is looking for a babysitter.

309
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:36,997
- I immediately thought of you. 
 - Pardon?

310
00:23:36,997 --> 00:23:40,037
She gave me an advance payment in cash,

311
00:23:40,037 --> 00:23:41,637
asking me to find a good babysitter.

312
00:23:41,637 --> 00:23:43,417
Goodness.

313
00:23:43,417 --> 00:23:47,087
I don't know if it's okay to decide so hastily.

314
00:23:47,087 --> 00:23:49,037
You should work somewhere close to your home.

315
00:23:49,037 --> 00:23:52,037
And don't worry about Ji Yool and Ha Yool.

316
00:23:55,147 --> 00:23:59,627
- Still— 
 - What do you mean, still? If you accept the money, you just do it.

317
00:24:01,167 --> 00:24:04,847
Did you finish eating? Do you want some coffee as well?

318
00:24:04,847 --> 00:24:09,717
C of D**** Department is said to be the main suspect in the murder of the Bannae-dong couple.

319
00:24:09,717 --> 00:24:14,217
According to a police official, the reference investigation was conducted three times.

320
00:24:15,197 --> 00:24:16,957
Gosh, this is driving me nuts. 
  This is crazy. Is this going to be the first person that works here who has been found to be a killer? 

321
00:24:16,957 --> 00:24:19,247
Why did the rumors spread like this? 
  Lee Jin Seop, don't you work with her? Tell us what happened.  

322
00:24:21,997 --> 00:24:24,757
 Hey guys, that's really not true— 

323
00:24:27,457 --> 00:24:29,677
Hey, this is going to overflow!

324
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:31,417
Oh, sorry.

325
00:24:32,427 --> 00:24:35,467
What are you so distracted by?

326
00:24:35,467 --> 00:24:37,177
It's nothing.

327
00:24:46,877 --> 00:24:50,327
Assistant Manager Jang, to be honest, I— 
 - You said you have a niece or nephew, right?

328
00:24:50,327 --> 00:24:52,187
Pardon? Yes.

329
00:24:52,187 --> 00:24:54,467
I do. I have two older sisters, so I have four of them.

330
00:24:54,467 --> 00:24:55,847
Three nieces and one nephew.

331
00:24:55,847 --> 00:24:57,727
Do you know this doll?

332
00:24:57,727 --> 00:25:01,507
Oh, this? This is a really expensive one. Why do you ask all of a sudden?

333
00:25:01,507 --> 00:25:04,087
It's just a farewell gift.

334
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:06,347
Who are you giving it to? The girls love it.

335
00:25:06,347 --> 00:25:08,897
I gave one recently to my second niece.

336
00:25:08,897 --> 00:25:11,657
I should have a picture of her after she got the gift.

337
00:25:11,657 --> 00:25:14,057
- Do you want to see it? 
- Forget it. Actually, let me see it.

338
00:25:14,057 --> 00:25:16,047
Hey, where's Assistant Manager Jang?

339
00:25:17,877 --> 00:25:21,007
Is this the time for you to be chatting and sipping coffee?

340
00:25:21,007 --> 00:25:23,547
Did you do a final check on the Headquarters Weekly Meeting Data or not?

341
00:25:23,547 --> 00:25:26,217
Of course, I did. What do you take me for?

342
00:25:26,217 --> 00:25:28,577
Even after you uploaded it to the shared drive?

343
00:25:28,577 --> 00:25:31,477
Take a look and see if this is this week's or last week's.

344
00:25:31,477 --> 00:25:34,067
 Trend of social media connected customers (Week 4 of November, 2022) 

345
00:25:37,637 --> 00:25:40,707
- I'm sorry. 
- What are you doing with your promotion right around the corner?

346
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:43,497
Why do you keep making mistakes?

347
00:25:44,397 --> 00:25:45,987
Gosh, just go.

348
00:25:45,987 --> 00:25:47,657
I'm sorry.

349
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:51,917
Assistant Manager Jang, I'm really sorry. I—

350
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:54,277
Forget it. It's nothing big.

351
00:25:55,477 --> 00:25:57,417
You should be more careful.

352
00:25:57,417 --> 00:25:58,417
Yes, I'll check.

353
00:25:58,417 --> 00:26:00,467
What's wrong with me?

354
00:26:03,587 --> 00:26:06,517
Assistant Manager Jang, let me see you for a moment.

355
00:26:09,417 --> 00:26:12,787
Assistant Manager Jang, why are you so unsettled lately?

356
00:26:12,787 --> 00:26:15,867
Why do I keep hearing scandalous things when you're facing a promotion?

357
00:26:16,737 --> 00:26:19,717
There are no scandalous things about me.

358
00:26:19,717 --> 00:26:21,947
Do you know that rumors about you are going around in the bank?

359
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:24,177
Do you know that the HR department called me?

360
00:26:24,177 --> 00:26:26,847
I heard you even got investigated by the police multiple times.

361
00:26:28,947 --> 00:26:32,547
You oblivious idiot, how will you survive in this company like that?

362
00:26:32,547 --> 00:26:36,537
You should know that being good at work isn't everything.

363
00:26:37,377 --> 00:26:38,867
Geez...

364
00:26:40,517 --> 00:26:43,117
- Is everything wrapped up now? 
- Of course!

365
00:26:43,117 --> 00:26:46,327
- You sure? 
- Seriously—

366
00:26:51,897 --> 00:26:55,727
If you can't guarantee it, take a break until things are settled.

367
00:26:55,727 --> 00:26:57,637
You need to use up those PTO days anyway.

368
00:26:58,387 --> 00:27:00,617
You haven't filed for it yet, right?

369
00:27:00,617 --> 00:27:02,957
Are you being serious right now?

370
00:27:02,957 --> 00:27:05,067
Even if I do, I won't take my PTO days like I'm being chased out.

371
00:27:05,067 --> 00:27:09,577
And if I'm not here, who will follow up on all the projects we've started?

372
00:27:09,577 --> 00:27:13,167
At this rate, you are only a liability to your team.

373
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:18,327
And you know that one person missing won't prevent a company from functioning.

374
00:27:18,327 --> 00:27:19,947
Are you upset?

375
00:27:20,737 --> 00:27:22,777
 Kang Bong Seok (Yu Jin's father-in-law) 

376
00:27:26,197 --> 00:27:27,597
No. Why would I be?

377
00:27:27,597 --> 00:27:30,007
It's not like I'll use the PTO.

378
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:33,467
Geez...

379
00:27:38,897 --> 00:27:41,027
I really didn't say much.

380
00:27:41,027 --> 00:27:42,837
A colleague from another department kept asking me,

381
00:27:42,837 --> 00:27:45,707
so I only told him you were her sister and went to her funeral—

382
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:48,647
Forget it. Who said I was curious?

383
00:27:50,207 --> 00:27:54,397
I'm sorry. I didn't know things would get so out of hand.

384
00:27:56,047 --> 00:27:58,637
- You're disappointed in me, right? 
- No.

385
00:27:58,637 --> 00:28:01,407
Who are you that I'd get disappointed by you?

386
00:28:01,407 --> 00:28:04,027
That's also an overinflated sense of ego.

387
00:28:08,557 --> 00:28:09,847
 Kang Bong Seok (Yu Jin's father-in-law) 

388
00:28:15,217 --> 00:28:16,107
Hello?

389
00:28:16,107 --> 00:28:18,997
 Jang Mi Ho, let me ask an urgent favor of you. 

390
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:21,277
 You'll need to come right away. 

391
00:28:21,277 --> 00:28:22,817
 Why should I? 

392
00:28:23,717 --> 00:28:25,147
Hello—

393
00:28:27,267 --> 00:28:29,307
This is driving me crazy!

394
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:31,547
Why is everyone doing this to me?

395
00:28:33,347 --> 00:28:35,337
See if I go.

396
00:28:44,457 --> 00:28:48,247
Must you guys go? Think carefully about it.

397
00:28:48,247 --> 00:28:50,597
I want to go.

398
00:28:52,887 --> 00:28:55,887
- All right, let's go.
 - Oh, yeah!

399
00:28:55,887 --> 00:28:57,437
So Won Eonni!

400
00:28:57,437 --> 00:28:59,597
So Won, Yang So Won!

401
00:29:01,007 --> 00:29:02,787
So Won!

402
00:29:03,837 --> 00:29:05,517
Ms. Hwang.

403
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:08,197
What brings you here?

404
00:29:08,197 --> 00:29:10,417
- What about work? 
- I came out briefly.

405
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:12,937
Today is really the last time.

406
00:29:12,937 --> 00:29:14,687
What about you?

407
00:29:14,687 --> 00:29:17,817
Since we implemented flextime, I get off work at 4 pm on the dot on Mondays and Thursdays.

408
00:29:17,817 --> 00:29:20,237
They accommodated me after I became a deputy general manager.

409
00:29:20,237 --> 00:29:21,757
I'm jealous.

410
00:29:46,187 --> 00:29:47,907
I guess you're not that close to them.

411
00:29:47,907 --> 00:29:51,987
It doesn't end there. They're out to eat me alive.

412
00:29:51,997 --> 00:29:53,867
Why?

413
00:29:55,857 --> 00:29:58,797
Before Yu Jin ended up like that,

414
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,197
we had some trouble.

415
00:30:02,387 --> 00:30:06,877
But since Yu Jin ended up like that, and with the rumor about murder over resentment,

416
00:30:06,877 --> 00:30:09,437
they treat me like the culprit.

417
00:30:09,437 --> 00:30:13,717
They probably want to blame someone for the bad thing that happened.

418
00:30:14,797 --> 00:30:20,857
But honestly, those women have a lot of resentment towards Yu Jin themselves.

419
00:30:26,277 --> 00:30:29,177
What's happened? Did someone do this on purpose?

420
00:30:29,177 --> 00:30:31,597
Gosh, no way.

421
00:30:34,807 --> 00:30:38,677
Do you know which one of those two came to this playground first?

422
00:30:38,677 --> 00:30:41,437
We wouldn't know since we arrived here with you.

423
00:30:41,437 --> 00:30:43,747
I'm starting to get a bit scared.

424
00:30:43,747 --> 00:30:47,507
It's not what I'm thinking of, right?

425
00:30:47,507 --> 00:30:51,087
Gosh, what are you saying? It was probably children playing around.

426
00:30:51,087 --> 00:30:53,807
But still, shouldn't we find out who did this?

427
00:30:53,807 --> 00:30:55,967
What do you mean, catch the culprit?

428
00:30:57,157 --> 00:30:59,037
She's already dead.

429
00:31:07,457 --> 00:31:11,447
The relationship among moms with kids who play together is ambiguous.

430
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:15,147
We open up with them more than we would do with our friends

431
00:31:15,147 --> 00:31:18,167
but you can never become friends.

432
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:22,867
If I were a cop, I would have investigated them first.

433
00:31:27,807 --> 00:31:29,947
Give me a second.

434
00:31:29,947 --> 00:31:31,317
What?

435
00:31:34,877 --> 00:31:37,737
Hello. You're the bank employee I saw last time...

436
00:31:37,737 --> 00:31:40,497
I mean, you're Ji Yool and Ha Yool's aunt, right?

437
00:31:40,497 --> 00:31:42,777
Oh, yes, hello.

438
00:31:42,777 --> 00:31:46,657
We reserved a Little Mermaid show at the aquarium.

439
00:31:46,657 --> 00:31:48,277
We reserved it as a group

440
00:31:48,277 --> 00:31:51,157
so Ji Yool and Ha Yool's seats are also reserved, so I'm thinking of taking them.

441
00:31:51,157 --> 00:31:52,997
That's all right with you, right?

442
00:31:52,997 --> 00:31:56,287
- Well...
 - I don't remember if I put it in here.

443
00:31:58,887 --> 00:32:02,137
I don't think that's for me to decide.

444
00:32:02,137 --> 00:32:05,277
I already got permission from their grandfather.

445
00:32:05,277 --> 00:32:07,847
I heard you came here in a rush from your work.

446
00:32:07,847 --> 00:32:09,657
Don't you have to go back?

447
00:32:09,657 --> 00:32:11,967
Oh, well, yes.

448
00:32:11,967 --> 00:32:15,947
- Then I'll leave them in your care.
 - Real Auntie!

449
00:32:15,947 --> 00:32:17,767
Are we going to the aquarium, too?

450
00:32:17,767 --> 00:32:20,457
Yeah, you are. Have a good time.

451
00:32:20,457 --> 00:32:22,717
Are you going with us, Real Auntie?

452
00:32:22,717 --> 00:32:26,367
Auntie says she's busy. You're going with me today.

453
00:32:26,367 --> 00:32:27,617
Go ahead and say goodbye.

454
00:32:27,617 --> 00:32:30,037
- Have a good time.
 - Bye-bye.

455
00:32:31,067 --> 00:32:33,567
Let's go.

456
00:32:58,967 --> 00:32:59,957
 v Jang Mi Ho 

457
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:09,977
- Yeah. 
- Assistant Manager, you're not coming back, right? Should I turn off your computer?

458
00:33:11,007 --> 00:33:13,647
Leave it. I'm coming back.

459
00:33:14,917 --> 00:33:17,347
 Are you going with us, Real Auntie? 

460
00:33:24,567 --> 00:33:27,027
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

461
00:34:02,747 --> 00:34:05,157
Ji Yool, Ha Yool.

462
00:34:05,157 --> 00:34:07,597
It's Real Auntie!

463
00:34:09,037 --> 00:34:10,637
Let's go.

464
00:34:12,837 --> 00:34:15,507
What about your work?

465
00:34:15,507 --> 00:34:18,177
I'm going to go to the aquarium first.

466
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:30,737
I guess you couldn't trust me.

467
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:32,377
Didn't I tell you?

468
00:34:32,377 --> 00:34:35,857
I was pretty much like a sister to Yu Jin.

469
00:34:35,857 --> 00:34:38,787
I'm pretty much like an aunt to the kids as well.

470
00:34:38,787 --> 00:34:40,927
It's not that I couldn't trust you.

471
00:34:40,927 --> 00:34:45,057
I was going to be responsible for them today since I was asked to.

472
00:34:47,097 --> 00:34:49,857
I heard you said you couldn't take care of the kids.

473
00:34:49,857 --> 00:34:51,497
Pardon?

474
00:34:51,497 --> 00:34:54,427
Yes, because of my work.

475
00:34:54,427 --> 00:34:58,207
- So, I'm thinking of helping out. 
 - I see.

476
00:34:58,207 --> 00:35:00,627
I can do at least that much.

477
00:35:00,627 --> 00:35:02,467
It's temporary, and

478
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:06,577
I heard that their grandfather would put up the house for sale.

479
00:35:06,577 --> 00:35:10,207
Min Seong, make sure there is no peanut candy there.

480
00:35:10,207 --> 00:35:13,167
Ji Yool has a peanut allergy.

481
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:20,357
 Assistant Manager Jang, you don't have to overextend yourself to return if you're busy. 

482
00:35:20,357 --> 00:35:23,447
 I'll cover for you, so take your time— 

483
00:35:30,257 --> 00:35:32,557
 Assistant Manager Jang, I'm really sorry about earlier. 

484
00:35:32,557 --> 00:35:34,537
 That won't happen again. 

485
00:35:34,537 --> 00:35:37,747
 From now on, I'll become a man you can trust— 

486
00:35:39,257 --> 00:35:41,297
I must be crazy. I must be crazy!

487
00:35:41,297 --> 00:35:43,567
Why would I use the word "man" here?

488
00:35:45,757 --> 00:35:47,867
 I'll become the subordinate you can trust. 

489
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:00,827
 Why am I overreacting? 

490
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:02,727
 Gosh, this is really bothering me. 

491
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:05,217
 I mean, it's not like I said the wrong thing. 

492
00:36:05,217 --> 00:36:06,527
What is it? What's the matter?

493
00:36:06,527 --> 00:36:08,187
Oh, well...

494
00:36:08,187 --> 00:36:10,197
What did Assistant Manager Jang say?

495
00:36:10,197 --> 00:36:12,847
- She said she would come back soon. 
- When is soon?

496
00:36:12,847 --> 00:36:15,327
How many hours has it been?

497
00:36:15,327 --> 00:36:17,297
Gosh, this is so unsettling.

498
00:36:17,297 --> 00:36:19,017
Don't be so like that.

499
00:36:19,017 --> 00:36:21,157
This isn't Assistant Manager Jang's fault.

500
00:36:21,157 --> 00:36:23,857
Aigoo, look at you taking her side as her subordinate.

501
00:36:23,857 --> 00:36:26,737
But did Assistant Manager Jang write up the weekly meeting data?

502
00:36:26,737 --> 00:36:29,157
- Pardon? 
- She didn't, huh?

503
00:36:29,157 --> 00:36:32,587
If that file isn't on my desk by tonight,

504
00:36:32,587 --> 00:36:34,767
she's dead.

505
00:36:38,047 --> 00:36:39,467
 Headquarters Weekly Meeting 

506
00:36:41,717 --> 00:36:43,497
 Person in charge: Jang Mi Ho 

507
00:36:45,517 --> 00:36:47,827
It's so pretty.

508
00:36:47,827 --> 00:36:49,367
No, Mom!

509
00:36:49,367 --> 00:36:51,227
Come with Min Seong.

510
00:37:10,147 --> 00:37:12,597
You might lose it, so let's put it in your bag.

511
00:37:13,417 --> 00:37:14,997
Why isn't this going in?

512
00:37:14,997 --> 00:37:17,347
Give me a second. I'll put it in for you.

513
00:37:21,977 --> 00:37:23,477
Let's go.

514
00:37:43,587 --> 00:37:47,527
Ha Yool, I'll put this in here, so let me know if you need it.

515
00:37:48,747 --> 00:37:52,677
Since they're girls, they're definitely a bit sensitive.

516
00:38:02,867 --> 00:38:04,367
Let's go.

517
00:38:04,367 --> 00:38:07,007
All right, go and take a seat. There. Go in.

518
00:38:07,007 --> 00:38:09,977
Since we booked the place for ourselves,

519
00:38:09,977 --> 00:38:12,857
let's spread out and take a seat.

520
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:15,547
Let's have you go in first.

521
00:38:15,547 --> 00:38:17,607
Children, let's take a seat.

522
00:38:18,787 --> 00:38:21,997
I'm sorry, but could you all sit closer together?

523
00:38:21,997 --> 00:38:24,217
Your seat has the best view of the show.

524
00:38:25,977 --> 00:38:27,807
What do you mean by that?

525
00:38:27,807 --> 00:38:29,317
There was a mistake with the reservation?

526
00:38:29,317 --> 00:38:31,807
There must've been a misunderstanding,

527
00:38:31,807 --> 00:38:33,617
since it's all done by human beings.

528
00:38:33,617 --> 00:38:38,087
Please let this slide just this once and just watch the show.

529
00:38:38,087 --> 00:38:39,867
Look here.

530
00:38:39,867 --> 00:38:44,697
Whether we choose just to watch it or not is not for you to decide. It's up to me.

531
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:47,057
Why do you think we paid that much to rent out the place?

532
00:38:47,057 --> 00:38:49,917
Why do you think we double and triple-checked our reservation?

533
00:38:49,917 --> 00:38:53,987
You think we have money and time to spare?

534
00:38:53,987 --> 00:38:57,867
But still, we can't just kick out other kindergarten kids.

535
00:38:57,867 --> 00:38:59,767
You were the one who made the mistake.

536
00:38:59,767 --> 00:39:03,577
Why are you talking as if I'm the one who needs to deal with it?

537
00:39:03,577 --> 00:39:05,707
Then, shall I give you a refund?

538
00:39:05,707 --> 00:39:07,407
Refund?

539
00:39:07,407 --> 00:39:09,907
Then what about compensation?

540
00:39:09,907 --> 00:39:13,757
How will you compensate for making our kids experience an unpleasant ordeal?

541
00:39:13,757 --> 00:39:17,127
- I want to play—
 - Shut up! Don't you hear me talking?

542
00:39:19,997 --> 00:39:23,477
There is nothing we can do right now.

543
00:39:23,477 --> 00:39:26,407
Please excuse us with the generosity of your heart—

544
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:29,627
You keep pushing the responsibility on me.

545
00:39:31,437 --> 00:39:35,107
I can't watch the show like this, so take responsibility for what will happen.

546
00:39:35,107 --> 00:39:39,517
I won't let this end with just a refund, so brace yourself.

547
00:39:43,137 --> 00:39:45,287
Are we going, too?

548
00:39:45,287 --> 00:39:49,607
I really want to watch the little mermaid show...

549
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:54,927
Let's go.

550
00:39:59,227 --> 00:40:00,777
Excuse me.

551
00:40:03,457 --> 00:40:04,857
Let's just let the kids watch the show.

552
00:40:04,857 --> 00:40:07,237
Didn't you hear what I said?

553
00:40:07,237 --> 00:40:08,997
We can't watch the show like this.

554
00:40:08,997 --> 00:40:13,527
How could we let the kids watch in such a harmful and unpleasant environment?

555
00:40:13,527 --> 00:40:16,347
What's so harmful and unpleasant?

556
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:19,507
It looks like you're the one interfering with the kids watching the show.

557
00:40:21,967 --> 00:40:25,837
Why do you use the kids as an excuse for your upset feelings?

558
00:40:27,137 --> 00:40:31,187
So, you're saying I'm the one to blame.

559
00:40:31,187 --> 00:40:33,317
That's not what I'm saying.

560
00:40:33,317 --> 00:40:37,127
I'm saying the kids want to watch the show, so we should let them.

561
00:40:37,127 --> 00:40:39,487
Do you guys want to watch the show?

562
00:40:40,547 --> 00:40:43,007
We can't watch the show like this. It's so unpleasant!

563
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:44,527
Let's hurry up and go.

564
00:40:45,467 --> 00:40:49,747
Oh, well, it appears that's only your opinion.

565
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:53,377
You can watch the show if you want.

566
00:40:57,377 --> 00:40:59,757
Can we watch the show?

567
00:41:01,087 --> 00:41:02,337
What?

568
00:41:05,057 --> 00:41:06,587
Yeah...

569
00:41:54,927 --> 00:41:57,167
What did I do today?

570
00:42:05,657 --> 00:42:08,557
Aigoo, today was difficult for you, huh?

571
00:42:08,557 --> 00:42:11,797
- I had something urgent in the afternoon.
 - It's okay.

572
00:42:11,797 --> 00:42:15,097
Goodness. All right.

573
00:42:15,097 --> 00:42:18,647
So, do you want to come inside for a bit before you go?

574
00:42:18,647 --> 00:42:21,117
And say your final goodbyes?

575
00:42:23,397 --> 00:42:25,677
I'll just leave.

576
00:42:25,677 --> 00:42:28,007
Stay healthy.

577
00:42:28,007 --> 00:42:30,537
I'll be going.

578
00:42:30,537 --> 00:42:33,417
Oh, right. This.

579
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,940
 HIGHPRESTIGE 

580
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:06,747
 Sir, do you know what time it is right now? 

581
00:43:15,507 --> 00:43:21,167
Sir, this is not the first time I've helped you out.

582
00:43:21,167 --> 00:43:24,877
How could I leave the kids by themselves?

583
00:43:27,377 --> 00:43:29,267
One moment.

584
00:43:41,567 --> 00:43:43,517
They are both sleeping.

585
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:48,127
 All right, but please come quickly. 

586
00:44:10,997 --> 00:44:14,037
Ha Yool, Ha Yool, wake up.

587
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,597
What is it?

588
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:00,807
What are you doing?

589
00:45:02,817 --> 00:45:06,247
Working late. I should do at least that much.

590
00:45:06,247 --> 00:45:07,577
Why did you come back so late?

591
00:45:07,577 --> 00:45:09,587
Some things came up.

592
00:45:26,037 --> 00:45:27,707
This is driving me crazy.

593
00:45:29,867 --> 00:45:31,427
Hey, Associate Manager Lee, I'm going back.

594
00:45:31,427 --> 00:45:34,007
Pardon? Where are you going?

595
00:45:35,017 --> 00:45:36,587
 Kang Bong Seok (Yu Jin's father-in-law) 

596
00:45:42,477 --> 00:45:44,037
Hello?

597
00:45:45,447 --> 00:45:46,827
What?

598
00:45:52,787 --> 00:45:55,687
How could you leave the kids by themselves at this time of night?

599
00:45:55,687 --> 00:45:57,647
Anything could happen to them!

600
00:45:57,647 --> 00:46:00,617
I did that only because he said he would come quickly...

601
00:46:00,617 --> 00:46:03,417
I heard the kids were sleeping, and I made a mistake.

602
00:46:03,417 --> 00:46:05,307
I didn't know this would happen.

603
00:46:05,307 --> 00:46:06,897
So what happened?

604
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:09,687
It's currently impossible to track them using cellphone GPS tracking.

605
00:46:09,687 --> 00:46:12,107
We are searching the CCTV footage for the path they took.

606
00:46:12,107 --> 00:46:16,607
It has been confirmed that the kids went down the elevator by themselves.

607
00:46:21,157 --> 00:46:23,337
Where did they go at this time of night?

608
00:46:23,337 --> 00:46:25,777
Based on the time of this footage, they probably didn't get very far.

609
00:46:25,777 --> 00:46:29,097
They don't have any means of transportation. So, they are probably in the vicinity.

610
00:46:29,097 --> 00:46:32,957
- We are searching for their whereabouts, so— 
 - What if something happens before we find them?

611
00:46:34,147 --> 00:46:37,137
Someone might have told the kids to come out.

612
00:46:37,137 --> 00:46:40,437
You know what happened to the kids' mom recently!

613
00:46:40,437 --> 00:46:43,237
How could you be so calm?

614
00:46:43,237 --> 00:46:45,367
My gosh...

615
00:47:01,577 --> 00:47:03,107
What happened?

616
00:47:03,107 --> 00:47:06,097
I heard Ji Yool and Ha Yool disappeared.

617
00:47:06,097 --> 00:47:09,287
- Did someone take them away? Or did they leave on their own? 
 - I don't know.

618
00:47:09,287 --> 00:47:11,587
Come to your senses! We have no time for this.

619
00:47:11,587 --> 00:47:13,157
When did the kids disappear?

620
00:47:13,157 --> 00:47:16,037
Around 10 pm. We confirmed them leaving the apartment building front door.

621
00:47:16,037 --> 00:47:17,717
What were they wearing?

622
00:47:17,717 --> 00:47:20,527
They were wearing blue casual-looking pajamas.

623
00:47:20,527 --> 00:47:24,747
Everyone who does social media here, please come over here.

624
00:47:26,297 --> 00:47:29,047
Please spread this everywhere as quickly as possible.

625
00:47:29,047 --> 00:47:31,287
 Kang Ji Yool, Kang Ha Yool. Wearing blue pajamas. 

626
00:47:31,287 --> 00:47:34,967
 They left High Prestige Apartment Building #151 around 10 pm and went missing. 

627
00:47:34,967 --> 00:47:39,617
 Please spread the news and call the following number if you see the children. 

628
00:47:39,617 --> 00:47:41,517
 Ji Yool! Ha Yool! 

629
00:47:42,357 --> 00:47:44,507
 Ji Yool! Ha Yool! 

630
00:47:44,507 --> 00:47:46,517
Ji Yool!

631
00:47:46,517 --> 00:47:48,177
Ha Yool!

632
00:47:51,007 --> 00:47:51,897
Ha Yool!

633
00:47:51,897 --> 00:47:54,657
Kang Ha Yool!

634
00:47:54,657 --> 00:47:57,117
 Ji Yool! Ha Yool! Where are you? 

635
00:47:57,117 --> 00:47:57,977
Ha Yool!

636
00:47:57,977 --> 00:48:00,877
- Ji Yool!
 - Ha Yool!

637
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:03,817
- Ji Yool! Ha Yool!
 - Ji Yool!

638
00:48:04,727 --> 00:48:06,587
Goodness.

639
00:48:11,167 --> 00:48:12,747
Ji Yool!

640
00:48:21,367 --> 00:48:24,147
Ji Yool! Ha Yool!

641
00:48:24,147 --> 00:48:27,067
- Ji Yool!
 - Ha Yool!

642
00:48:27,067 --> 00:48:29,217
- What is it?
 - Eonni...

643
00:48:30,447 --> 00:48:31,827
I have such a bad feeling about this.

644
00:48:31,827 --> 00:48:34,467
If you want to talk nonsense, hang up. Don't you know things are crazy right now?

645
00:48:34,467 --> 00:48:37,787
 - The tree was pulled out by its roots!  
 - What?

646
00:48:37,787 --> 00:48:41,687
You know, Yu Jin's tree.

647
00:48:41,687 --> 00:48:46,637
Eonni, don't you think someone with a grudge against Yu Jin did this?

648
00:48:46,637 --> 00:48:49,887
 What if someone really kidnapped the kids? 

649
00:49:05,017 --> 00:49:06,747
 I got a DM. 

650
00:49:06,747 --> 00:49:10,437
 Someone saw two girls on the 740 bus. 

651
00:49:10,437 --> 00:49:11,547
 Probably another false alarm. 

652
00:49:11,547 --> 00:49:13,917
 I don't know if it's okay to say this, 

653
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:16,687
 but I don't think just searching like this will work. 

654
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:19,027
 I think someone took the kids. 

655
00:49:19,027 --> 00:49:20,477
 Gosh, that's crazy. 

656
00:49:20,477 --> 00:49:22,237
 No way./i&gt; 

657
00:49:22,237 --> 00:49:24,277
 What evidence... 

658
00:49:29,047 --> 00:49:31,387
 740 Bus? 

659
00:49:34,537 --> 00:49:35,997
 740 Bus 740 

660
00:49:38,607 --> 00:49:41,207
 740 Bus Company 

661
00:50:07,357 --> 00:50:10,257
Ji Yool, Ha Yool!

662
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:12,807
Real Auntie...

663
00:50:15,117 --> 00:50:16,557
Yeah...

664
00:50:20,717 --> 00:50:23,387
Okay, okay. Let me see you.

665
00:50:29,567 --> 00:50:31,097
Why did you get on the bus?

666
00:50:31,097 --> 00:50:33,947
So we could go to see you.

667
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:36,607
I wanted to see you.

668
00:50:52,327 --> 00:50:54,047
Wash up.

669
00:51:00,837 --> 00:51:02,777
Thank you so much.

670
00:51:02,777 --> 00:51:05,767
If it weren't for you, Song Jeong Ah, it could've been really bad.

671
00:51:05,767 --> 00:51:07,777
 We should all help each other out. 

672
00:51:07,777 --> 00:51:11,247
Yu Jin was so dear to me.

673
00:51:12,137 --> 00:51:14,107
So don't mention it.

674
00:51:14,107 --> 00:51:16,127
Have a good night.

675
00:51:23,357 --> 00:51:25,587
We should sleep now.

676
00:51:25,587 --> 00:51:28,867
Great job today, Honey.

677
00:51:28,867 --> 00:51:30,537
You're so cool.

678
00:51:30,537 --> 00:51:32,227
Yeah.

679
00:51:57,117 --> 00:51:59,707
Die, die!

680
00:51:59,707 --> 00:52:01,417
Die!

681
00:52:01,417 --> 00:52:03,997
Die, die, die, die!

682
00:52:03,997 --> 00:52:05,787
Die!

683
00:52:48,077 --> 00:52:50,937
 Team Leader, I'll use a PTO day tomorrow— 

684
00:52:59,367 --> 00:53:01,617
What are you doing not washing up?

685
00:53:13,627 --> 00:53:15,357
The water isn't hot, right?

686
00:53:40,577 --> 00:53:42,557
 Bannae-dong couple 

687
00:53:43,737 --> 00:53:46,377
 The murder case of the Bannae-dong couple 

688
00:53:46,377 --> 00:53:48,037
 The murder case of the Bannae-dong couple goes unsolved... Will it be a prolonged investigation? 

689
00:53:48,037 --> 00:53:51,027
 The murder case of the Bannae-dong couple goes unsolved... 

690
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:53,397
 Will the investigation become prolonged? 

691
00:53:54,197 --> 00:53:59,767
 The investigation of the Bannae-dong couple murder case is expected to be prolonged. 

692
00:54:00,857 --> 00:54:06,887
 The couple A and B were stabbed in H apartment in Bannae-dong. 

693
00:54:08,517 --> 00:54:10,777
 According to the investigating authorities, 

694
00:54:10,777 --> 00:54:14,527
 the police have not identified a suspect in the recent murder 

695
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:18,247
 of the couple living in a luxury apartment in Bannae-dong. 

696
00:54:18,247 --> 00:54:22,047
 On the date of the incident, the CCTVs were in the process of being changed. 

697
00:54:22,047 --> 00:54:25,387
 So the police are having difficulties obtaining footage— 

698
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:28,057
 Mommy... 

699
00:54:31,307 --> 00:54:33,307
- Ha Yool!
 - Mommy...

700
00:54:33,307 --> 00:54:35,437
Ha Yool, what's wrong?

701
00:54:36,247 --> 00:54:40,487
- What's wrong?
 - I want to see Mommy.

702
00:54:40,487 --> 00:54:43,597
Me, too. I miss Mommy.

703
00:54:43,597 --> 00:54:44,717
Mommy...

704
00:54:44,717 --> 00:54:46,827
H-Hey, guys...

705
00:54:46,827 --> 00:54:50,227
I want to go home. 
 - I want to go home.

706
00:54:50,227 --> 00:54:52,627
Where will you go at this hour?

707
00:54:52,627 --> 00:54:55,567
Let's just sleep here tonight, and let's go tomorrow.

708
00:54:55,567 --> 00:54:58,027
No! I want to go home!

709
00:54:58,027 --> 00:54:59,767
No!

710
00:55:00,617 --> 00:55:02,927
I want to see Mommy.

711
00:55:03,837 --> 00:55:05,997
 Mommy... 

712
00:55:06,877 --> 00:55:09,667
I want to see Mommy!

713
00:55:12,467 --> 00:55:15,747
 Mommy... 

714
00:55:32,107 --> 00:55:33,787
There.

715
00:55:50,787 --> 00:55:53,577
Team Leader, I'm going to use my PTO starting tomorrow.

716
00:57:23,957 --> 00:57:29,897
♫  A page stained with lies  ♫

717
00:57:29,897 --> 00:57:35,617
♫  There is no truth there  ♫

718
00:57:35,617 --> 00:57:42,737
♫  Every moment is growing faint  ♫

719
00:57:42,737 --> 00:57:48,607
♫  A game full of confusion  ♫

720
00:57:48,607 --> 00:57:54,577
♫  Something's wrong, open my closed eyes  ♫

721
00:57:55,507 --> 00:57:58,987
 Battle For Happiness 

722
00:57:58,987 --> 00:58:01,157
 Real Auntie! 

723
00:58:01,157 --> 00:58:02,947
 You should wipe my butt! 

724
00:58:02,947 --> 00:58:06,407
 Please give me some advice on how to take care of girls aged 7 and 5. 

725
00:58:06,407 --> 00:58:10,177
 No! No! I don't want to! 

726
00:58:10,177 --> 00:58:14,897
 But I hope the bottom feeder won't contaminate the rest of the neighborhood. 

727
00:58:14,897 --> 00:58:16,657
 What is that finger wound? 

728
00:58:16,657 --> 00:58:18,677
 It's not me! Who says it's me? 

729
00:58:18,677 --> 00:58:21,387
 I feel bad because I think I'm always receiving your help. 

730
00:58:21,387 --> 00:58:23,897
 I wonder where it is? 

731
00:58:23,897 --> 00:58:25,167
 Song Jeong Ah? 

732
00:58:25,167 --> 00:58:27,867
 The apartment layout is opposite of ours. 

733
00:58:32,837 --> 00:58:34,567
 Where did you get this? 

734
00:58:34,567 --> 00:58:35,657
 Is this your dad? 

735
00:58:35,657 --> 00:58:37,117
 What? So you can spread rumors again? 

736
00:58:37,117 --> 00:58:40,017
 I want to be on good terms with you. 

737
00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:42,307
 How dare you lay your hand on him! 

738
00:58:43,277 --> 00:58:45,117
 Who were you with? 

739
00:58:45,117 --> 00:58:47,417
 Seriously, what's wrong with you! 

740
00:58:47,417 --> 00:58:48,657
 You deserve to die. 

741
00:58:48,657 --> 00:58:51,757
 I got it. Na Yeong, so please slow down!
