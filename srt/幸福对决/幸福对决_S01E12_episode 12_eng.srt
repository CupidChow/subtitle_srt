 This is a work of fiction. Characters, locations, agencies, incidents, organizations, and jobs have no relation to real life.

12
00:00:48,974 --> 00:00:52,024

I really have nothing to do with that woman!

13
00:00:52,024 --> 00:00:53,394
 - Su Bin.
 - Yeah?

14
00:00:53,394 --> 00:00:54,604
 Do you have anything to say to me?

15
00:00:54,604 --> 00:00:56,374
 You were on the phone with Su Bin last night, weren't you?

16
00:00:56,374 --> 00:00:58,504
 You guys were talking about a woman. What woman?

17
00:00:58,504 --> 00:01:01,534
 Why should I tell you that, Noona?

18
00:01:01,534 --> 00:01:03,164
 That's the key to my personal wallet.

19
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:05,714
 I don't know why, but my stomach's not feeling well these days.

20
00:01:05,714 --> 00:01:07,074
 Your wife is pregnant.

21
00:01:07,074 --> 00:01:09,974
 You said you'd do bare minimum, so how could she get pregnant?

22
00:01:09,974 --> 00:01:11,964
 - I heard she's Ms. Sim's daughter.
 - Her daughter?

23
00:01:11,964 --> 00:01:13,784
 She lived like a rat in a place like this.

24
00:01:13,784 --> 00:01:15,434
 Yu Jin lived here?

25
00:01:15,434 --> 00:01:19,054
 Your amazing mother abused her like a dog and then kicked her out.

26
00:01:19,054 --> 00:01:21,064
 What is that key for?

27
00:01:21,064 --> 00:01:23,744
 What is it that Jang Mi Ho is going to such lengths?

28
00:01:23,744 --> 00:01:25,764
 It seems there's something you haven't told me.

29
00:01:25,764 --> 00:01:27,224
 Shut your mouth!

30
00:01:27,224 --> 00:01:29,104
 I wouldn't talk! You sold off your daughter's life!

31
00:01:29,104 --> 00:01:32,354
 The person who left the package outside Yu Jin's house.

32
00:01:32,354 --> 00:01:33,874
 Who is it?

33
00:01:33,874 --> 00:01:37,294
 Who was there that day?

34
00:01:43,274 --> 00:01:47,154
 Do you know how messy things got because you left the package there?

35
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:52,224
 Look who's talking. You should've kept your promise in the first place.

36
00:01:52,224 --> 00:01:54,784
 I didn't keep quiet just to watch this mess happen, either.

37
00:01:54,784 --> 00:01:56,414
 This isn't how you repay your debt...

38
00:01:56,414 --> 00:01:58,404
What the hell.

39
00:01:58,404 --> 00:02:01,964
 What are you talking about? You're the one who owes me!

40
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:12,164
 But you're the one that killed Yu Jin

41
00:02:12,164 --> 00:02:15,104
 But you're the one that killed Yu Jin.

42
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:28,090

43
00:02:32,334 --> 00:02:37,034
 You were hiding in our house that day.

44
00:02:40,534 --> 00:02:45,514
 Don't you dare blame me. Do you think I don't know what you're thinking?

45
00:02:45,514 --> 00:02:48,544
 What? I just said the truth.

46
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:52,224
 I didn't cover for you for this to happen.

47
00:02:54,104 --> 00:02:58,554
 Are you nuts? Why do you keep talking nonsense?

48
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:02,034
 Stop. Do you think you can back out now?

49
00:03:02,034 --> 00:03:05,984
 Just remember, we both have each other in a chokehold.

50
00:03:05,984 --> 00:03:08,514
 The key doesn't matter anyway.

51
00:03:27,184 --> 00:03:29,984
 There's nothing inside.

52
00:03:47,964 --> 00:03:50,514
 I'm telling you not to give Jang Mi Ho any clues.

53
00:03:50,514 --> 00:03:52,384
 Use your brain.

54
00:03:52,384 --> 00:03:55,134
 And if you do shit like this ever again,

55
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:58,144
 Your kid will be the one to pay for it. So think wisely.

56
00:04:05,534 --> 00:04:08,434
What's this? Why is this here...

Is this all the information on Jang Mi Ho?

61
00:04:45,594 --> 00:04:48,164
 Well, do you need more?

62
00:04:49,904 --> 00:04:51,174
Hey.

63
00:04:51,174 --> 00:04:53,454
Is this how you do your job?

64
00:04:53,454 --> 00:04:55,864
Get all the data you can!

65
00:04:55,864 --> 00:04:57,714
 Yes, will do.

66
00:05:00,624 --> 00:05:02,094
And also...

67
00:05:02,934 --> 00:05:05,134
can you look into one more person?

68
00:05:06,384 --> 00:05:08,684
I'll send you the name and picture.

69
00:05:09,614 --> 00:05:13,354
Get every ounce of dirt you can find about this person, too.

70
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,864
It's so odd...

71
00:05:28,864 --> 00:05:30,964
I wonder why they put this in there.

72
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:33,764
This doesn't look so important.

73
00:05:33,764 --> 00:05:35,434
Exactly.

74
00:05:37,924 --> 00:05:39,694
I'll go to the kindergarten.

75
00:05:39,694 --> 00:05:43,474
Apparently, Yu Jin took all of Ji Yool's drawings before she died.

76
00:05:43,474 --> 00:05:45,684
They might be related.

77
00:06:10,994 --> 00:06:13,084
Mr. Kang Do Joon.

78
00:06:13,084 --> 00:06:16,134
Around 8:50 pm on the day Oh Yu Jin died,

79
00:06:16,134 --> 00:06:18,884
you said Jang Mi Ho came to your house.

80
00:06:18,884 --> 00:06:21,984
And after Oh Yu Jin and Jang Mi Ho had an argument,

81
00:06:21,984 --> 00:06:24,974
your wife was riled up when she came home.

82
00:06:24,974 --> 00:06:28,964
She brought out a knife from the kitchen after saying she'd kill everyone.

83
00:06:28,964 --> 00:06:30,474
That was your statement. Correct?

84
00:06:31,794 --> 00:06:33,954
Why did Oh Yu Jin do that so suddenly?

85
00:06:33,954 --> 00:06:36,944
If she was riled up about Jang Mi Ho,

86
00:06:36,944 --> 00:06:40,054
why did she suddenly wield the knife at you, Kang Do Joon?

87
00:06:40,054 --> 00:06:44,004
Was there an argument between you and Oh Yu Jin?

88
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:54,384
She didn't wield the knife at me.

89
00:06:54,384 --> 00:06:55,994
She tried to harm herself.

90
00:06:55,994 --> 00:06:58,554
I was just trying to stop her.

91
00:06:58,554 --> 00:07:03,004
And I can't answer the question as to why Yu Jin did that.

92
00:07:03,004 --> 00:07:07,104
Since I don't have delusional disorder, anxiety disorder, depression, or victim mentality.

93
00:07:07,104 --> 00:07:09,304
Kang Do Joon.

94
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:12,264
We've checked all of Oh Yu Jin's hospital records,

95
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:15,684
but we didn't find any diagnosis or conditions of that sort.

96
00:07:15,684 --> 00:07:17,724
Of course, you didn't.

97
00:07:17,724 --> 00:07:21,074
She cared most about what others thought of her.

98
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:23,874
She wanted to appear to be living a perfect life.

99
00:07:23,874 --> 00:07:30,744
Why would a woman like that admit to having a mental illness?

100
00:07:34,214 --> 00:07:35,984
But hold on.

101
00:07:36,684 --> 00:07:38,224
I understand victim mentality,

102
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:41,994
but terms like delusional disorder, anxiety disorder, and depression.

103
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:44,684
You can't say until you're diagnosed by a doctor.

104
00:07:44,684 --> 00:07:47,774
You keep using those words over and over again.

105
00:07:47,774 --> 00:07:50,504
It seems like you may have a motive.

106
00:07:53,484 --> 00:07:55,904
There's no motive.

107
00:07:55,904 --> 00:07:57,444
Also...

108
00:07:57,444 --> 00:08:00,694
is a hospital diagnosis

109
00:08:01,534 --> 00:08:03,834
the only way to call a disease a disease?

110
00:08:14,664 --> 00:08:17,524
 Approval Needed 
 You just need to check the revised parts.

111
00:08:25,864 --> 00:08:29,384
For the expected results, let's put qualitative before quantitative.

112
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,024
Since it's a brand marketing perspective,

113
00:08:31,024 --> 00:08:33,334
showing numbers like this might look like a stretch.

114
00:08:33,334 --> 00:08:34,674
Understood.

115
00:08:34,674 --> 00:08:36,324
When can you revise it?

116
00:08:36,324 --> 00:08:38,874
The Vice President is leaving early tomorrow afternoon for a meeting

117
00:08:38,874 --> 00:08:40,324
with department heads at the Chungnam headquarters.

118
00:08:40,324 --> 00:08:43,934
I'll revise and make sure you can report to him by then.

119
00:08:43,934 --> 00:08:46,174
Hey, are you sure you can revise by tomorrow?

120
00:08:46,174 --> 00:08:47,624
If it's too much, I can change the deadline.

121
00:08:47,624 --> 00:08:49,204
No, I can come early in the morning.

122
00:08:49,204 --> 00:08:51,144
I'm leaving, Team Leader.

123
00:09:21,724 --> 00:09:24,954

The kids are asleep, so it'll be difficult.

124
00:09:24,954 --> 00:09:27,944
 I'm sorry, but I'll just come by the house briefly then.

125
00:09:27,944 --> 00:09:30,604
 I have something to look for in the kids' room.

126
00:09:39,674 --> 00:09:40,574
 GK Parcel Service

127
00:09:43,524 --> 00:09:45,504
 GK Parcel Service

128
00:09:49,344 --> 00:09:52,374
Mr. Driver, hello. I have a question.

129
00:09:52,374 --> 00:09:53,834
Yes, go ahead.

130
00:09:54,704 --> 00:09:56,754
The shipping date was December 4th.

131
00:09:56,754 --> 00:09:59,694
It arrived more than a month late last Wednesday.

132
00:09:59,694 --> 00:10:02,424
Could you check if it was lost before?

133
00:10:02,424 --> 00:10:04,344
Give me one second.

134
00:10:11,274 --> 00:10:13,914
Oh, okay! All right.

135
00:10:14,524 --> 00:10:16,464
It hasn't been lost.

136
00:10:16,464 --> 00:10:19,874
It was delivered at 9:20 pm the very next day.

137
00:10:19,874 --> 00:10:23,784
But the sender and recipient should've gotten a text.

138
00:10:24,564 --> 00:10:26,264
There was no theft report, either.

139
00:10:26,264 --> 00:10:30,414
Someone might've taken it by mistake, so check with the management office.

140
00:10:34,964 --> 00:10:39,384
Mr. Driver! Was the parcel really delivered at 9:20 pm the very next day?

141
00:10:39,384 --> 00:10:40,544
Definitely?

142
00:10:40,544 --> 00:10:41,824
Yes.

143
00:10:47,244 --> 00:10:49,864
 The parcel was delivered on the day of the incident.

144
00:10:50,604 --> 00:10:53,454
 And also right after Yu Jin's time of death.

145
00:10:54,634 --> 00:10:56,854
 But why did it disappear?

146
00:11:02,614 --> 00:11:04,544
 The day Yu Jin died.

147
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:09,524
 Right, someone could've been in Yu Jin's house that day.

148
00:11:09,524 --> 00:11:11,344
We don't have it! There's nothing.

149
00:11:11,344 --> 00:11:13,314
This is clearly a theft.

150
00:11:13,314 --> 00:11:15,464
I'll just check who took the parcel.

151
00:11:15,464 --> 00:11:17,904
No, it's not that I won't show you.

152
00:11:17,904 --> 00:11:20,714
We don't have the CCTV footage from that day.

153
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:25,044
Isn't the day the parcel arrived the same day as the Building 151 murder?

154
00:11:25,044 --> 00:11:28,094
Don't you remember the CCTVs were being replaced that day?

155
00:11:28,094 --> 00:11:30,834
I told you they were being replaced.

156
00:11:30,834 --> 00:11:33,984
Then please show me who put the parcel back six days ago.

157
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:38,944
Because of privacy laws and all that, I can't show it without a warrant nowadays.

158
00:11:38,944 --> 00:11:43,064
And also, there aren't any CCTVs in the apartment halls.

159
00:11:43,064 --> 00:11:45,994
I heard someone putting the package back.

160
00:11:45,994 --> 00:11:47,424
That was at 7 pm,

161
00:11:47,424 --> 00:11:51,754
so you could show me the footage from the entrance or elevator.

162
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:53,434
No! I can't do it.

163
00:11:53,434 --> 00:11:57,544
You got it back anyway, so it wasn't theft.

164
00:11:57,544 --> 00:12:01,384
Madam, let's not complicate things.

165
00:12:33,104 --> 00:12:36,014
 Management Office

166
00:12:36,744 --> 00:12:38,554
Excuse me.

167
00:12:40,164 --> 00:12:43,064
Hello, I lost my parcel.

168
00:12:43,064 --> 00:12:45,674
I came to check the CCTV footage.

169
00:12:45,674 --> 00:12:48,894
You have to make a request through the management office.

170
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:51,734
You also need to fill out the CCTV inspection request.

171
00:12:51,734 --> 00:12:53,924
The Manager has already gone home.

172
00:12:53,924 --> 00:12:56,904
He told me to just check it here.

173
00:12:56,904 --> 00:12:59,164
He left early today...

174
00:13:00,164 --> 00:13:03,254
Just the entrance to Building 151 from six days ago at 7:10 pm.

175
00:13:03,254 --> 00:13:07,394
I just need to see the footage of the underground parking lot entrance and the elevator.

176
00:13:08,734 --> 00:13:12,364
He said since the time frame is short, there's no risk of invasion of privacy.

177
00:13:12,364 --> 00:13:13,904
He told me to go ahead and check.

178
00:13:13,904 --> 00:13:18,004
I can't show you the footage of the elevator for invasion of privacy reasons.

179
00:13:18,004 --> 00:13:20,464
But I can show you the entrance.

180
00:13:20,464 --> 00:13:22,894
Can you wait here?

181
00:13:22,894 --> 00:13:24,144
Sure.

182
00:13:32,094 --> 00:13:33,904
Take a look.

183
00:14:09,674 --> 00:14:12,434
It's not just once or twice.

184
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:16,844
How long do I have to keep being called in to be questioned as a suspect?

185
00:14:16,844 --> 00:14:19,874
I spoke with Attorneys Kang and Lee earlier.

186
00:14:19,874 --> 00:14:21,504
You have nothing to worry about.

187
00:14:21,504 --> 00:14:24,104
The cops have nothing.

188
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:29,504
There's no CCTV nor a witness.

189
00:14:29,504 --> 00:14:33,714
Bloodstains, cuts on corpses, fingerprints on weapons, the angle or depth of the stab.

190
00:14:33,714 --> 00:14:36,754
None of these can prove that it was a murder.

191
00:14:36,754 --> 00:14:39,004
That's why they keep calling you in for "questioning"

192
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:41,904
but waiting for you to confess, Kang Do Joon.

193
00:14:43,104 --> 00:14:46,664
As of now, the police can't easily send it to the prosecution.

194
00:14:46,664 --> 00:14:48,114
The prosecution can't indict, either.

195
00:14:48,114 --> 00:14:50,094
Even if you were to go to trial,

196
00:14:50,094 --> 00:14:53,044
it's not like there's additional evidence. There is no confession or motive.

197
00:14:53,044 --> 00:14:55,324
How would they prove it was a murder?

198
00:14:55,324 --> 00:14:56,734
Trial?

199
00:14:58,144 --> 00:15:00,254
Are you telling me to go to trial?

200
00:15:00,254 --> 00:15:04,554
Of course not. We'll definitely end this at the investigative stage.

201
00:15:04,554 --> 00:15:08,434
You don't even go to trial without any circumstantial or indirect evidence.

202
00:15:08,434 --> 00:15:10,534
 Loan Application

203
00:15:12,134 --> 00:15:14,034
 Letter of Confirmation

204
00:15:14,034 --> 00:15:18,964
 Diagnosis / Mild depressive episodes / Insomnia 
 That's why it's important to prove Oh Yu Jin's mental illness.

205
00:15:18,964 --> 00:15:22,574
That way, our statement sounds more persuasive.

206
00:15:23,454 --> 00:15:25,344
What if I do have a confession?

207
00:15:25,344 --> 00:15:27,604
Why? Will you confess?

208
00:15:27,604 --> 00:15:28,984
No.

209
00:15:29,594 --> 00:15:32,044
Another suspect's confession.

210
00:15:38,794 --> 00:15:41,284
- Does that mean—
 - I'm kidding!

211
00:15:41,284 --> 00:15:44,004
I'm just playing.

212
00:15:45,494 --> 00:15:49,744
Kang Do Joon, what actually happened that day?

213
00:16:18,104 --> 00:16:20,524
He's a lot crazier than I thought.

214
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:28,934
 Ah Ra

 Block

217
00:17:07,874 --> 00:17:10,514
Why would you come here? Are you out of your mind?

218
00:17:10,514 --> 00:17:12,594
Why don't you pick up the phone?

219
00:17:12,594 --> 00:17:15,714
Also, did you check? Is she really pregnant?

220
00:17:15,714 --> 00:17:17,234
Is that important right now?

221
00:17:17,234 --> 00:17:20,144
- What if someone sees us?
 - How could you say that to me?

222
00:17:20,144 --> 00:17:23,964
Oppa, what's more important than your wife being pregnant?

223
00:17:23,964 --> 00:17:26,954
- What's your plan?
 - Gosh, enough!

224
00:17:26,954 --> 00:17:29,874
Get a divorce right now. Who cares if she's pregnant or not.

225
00:17:29,874 --> 00:17:33,894
If not, I'm going to tell everyone at your work about us.

226
00:17:34,924 --> 00:17:37,044
Do you think getting a divorce is that easy?

227
00:17:38,214 --> 00:17:40,114
If Na Yeong's really pregnant,

228
00:17:40,114 --> 00:17:43,024
how could I turn a blind eye to that child?

229
00:17:45,194 --> 00:17:47,604
Then is the baby I'm pregnant with not yours?

230
00:17:47,604 --> 00:17:50,274
What about this baby?

231
00:17:50,274 --> 00:17:53,054
You said you'd get a divorce and marry me!

232
00:17:53,054 --> 00:17:54,274
Ah Ra...

233
00:17:55,124 --> 00:17:57,234
I know how you feel right now.

234
00:17:57,234 --> 00:17:59,534
But you can't do this to me.

235
00:17:59,534 --> 00:18:01,824
Why can't you read the situation?

236
00:18:01,824 --> 00:18:02,734
What?

237
00:18:02,734 --> 00:18:06,674
Whether I get a divorce or live with you, I decide that not you.

238
00:18:06,674 --> 00:18:10,881
Even if she knows you're pregnant, Na Yeong can't divorce me.

239
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:15,354
She would raise your child! She'd never divorce me!

240
00:18:15,354 --> 00:18:17,374
You can't break up with me, either.

241
00:18:18,194 --> 00:18:22,194
In a situation like this, who do you think can make the decisions?

242
00:18:24,084 --> 00:18:27,834
So don't tell me what to do. Just wait.

243
00:18:33,094 --> 00:18:34,524
Bye.

244
00:18:55,394 --> 00:18:57,154
You won't get away with this.

00:20:40,424 --> 00:20:42,534
 Team Leader, do you think that makes sense?

274
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:45,244
 The prosecution indicts, not you.

275
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,344
But this is wrong.

276
00:20:47,344 --> 00:20:50,564
What do you mean you won't indict?

277
00:20:50,564 --> 00:20:51,504
Let's go.

278
00:20:51,504 --> 00:20:52,924
What do you mean?

279
00:20:52,924 --> 00:20:55,254
- Let's talk outside.
 - Wait—

280
00:21:10,744 --> 00:21:12,984
I can't tell you about the investigation's progress.

281
00:21:12,984 --> 00:21:15,424
Are you not sending it to the prosecution?

282
00:21:16,554 --> 00:21:21,154
Well, it'll probably be difficult unless there's new evidence.

283
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:24,354
Detective! Someone was murdered with a knife!

284
00:21:24,354 --> 00:21:26,724
Does it make sense no one will be punished?

285
00:21:26,724 --> 00:21:28,784
Kang Do Joon has no motive,

286
00:21:28,784 --> 00:21:31,674
and there's no evidence to prove it was a murder.

287
00:21:31,674 --> 00:21:35,214
Then, can't you investigate someone else?

288
00:21:37,094 --> 00:21:41,444
I think someone was there the day Yu Jin died.

289
00:21:44,834 --> 00:21:48,544
This is a package that arrived at 9:20 pm the night Yu Jin died.

290
00:21:48,544 --> 00:21:50,704
But this person took the package,

291
00:21:50,704 --> 00:21:55,154
then returned it six days ago, which is more than a month later.

292
00:21:55,154 --> 00:21:58,044
This is the video of her returning it.

293
00:21:58,044 --> 00:22:01,724
Then this person, after 9:20 pm on the day Yu Jin died,

294
00:22:01,724 --> 00:22:04,734
must've taken this package right before the police came.

295
00:22:04,734 --> 00:22:09,834
Do you think it was a coincidence that someone would take this parcel at that specific time?

296
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,574
Maybe...

297
00:22:16,724 --> 00:22:19,934
I know this might be a stretch, but this person

298
00:22:19,934 --> 00:22:22,704
might've been at the crime scene.

299
00:22:23,774 --> 00:22:25,354
You can't prove anything with this.

300
00:22:25,354 --> 00:22:28,484
Maybe she's a witness or an accomplice.

301
00:22:29,674 --> 00:22:32,974
Or the culprit.

302
00:22:47,084 --> 00:22:48,394
 Deputy Head Hwang Ji Hye (Shindang Station Branch)

303
00:22:49,584 --> 00:22:52,714
 The phone is turned off. You'll be connected to the voicemail.

304
00:22:52,714 --> 00:22:55,674
 After the beep, there will be an additional charge.

305
00:23:16,134 --> 00:23:18,944
Deputy Manager, let's talk!

306
00:23:18,944 --> 00:23:21,174
I know you're home!

307
00:23:21,174 --> 00:23:23,334
Deputy Manager!

308
00:23:23,334 --> 00:23:26,934
- Mom.
 -  Deputy Manager!

309
00:23:30,254 --> 00:23:31,404
 Deputy Manager.

310
00:23:31,404 --> 00:23:33,794
Mom.

311
00:23:38,514 --> 00:23:42,244
-  Deputy Manager Hwang!  
- Go back inside.

312
00:24:48,824 --> 00:24:50,134
Mom.

313
00:24:50,134 --> 00:24:52,484
Why did you wake up again, So Won?

314
00:24:52,484 --> 00:24:54,704
Was it too loud?

315
00:24:54,704 --> 00:24:57,584
I guess you're too startled to sleep.

316
00:24:57,584 --> 00:25:01,064
That was Ji Yool's aunt earlier, right?

317
00:25:01,064 --> 00:25:03,634
Why didn't you open the door for her?

318
00:25:07,534 --> 00:25:09,784
We're playing hide and seek.

319
00:25:09,784 --> 00:25:12,244
I can't get caught.

320
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:17,004
If I get caught, then you have to suffer too, So Won.

321
00:25:19,314 --> 00:25:22,264
So let's make sure to hide really well.

322
00:25:22,264 --> 00:25:24,114
Okay, got it.

323
00:25:26,624 --> 00:25:30,334
All I need is you, So Won.

324
00:25:30,334 --> 00:25:33,974
There's nothing I can't do for you, So Won.

325
00:25:35,314 --> 00:25:36,754
My baby.

326
00:25:48,434 --> 00:25:50,144
 Corporate Loan Product Description

327
00:26:17,654 --> 00:26:19,324
 The call is not going through.

328
00:26:19,324 --> 00:26:20,364
 Manager Gong Chang Hyeon

329
00:26:23,124 --> 00:26:26,154
 It's about something else, so pick up.

330
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:32,064
 Look into my husband.

331
00:26:58,084 --> 00:26:59,344
 Pandora's Box

332
00:27:01,234 --> 00:27:03,934
 Hwang Ji Hye

333
00:27:09,854 --> 00:27:11,714
 Hwang Ji Hye

334
00:27:17,144 --> 00:27:21,824
 Hwang Ji Hye

335
00:27:24,994 --> 00:27:27,294
 Deputy Manager Hwang, are you free during lunch tomorrow?

336
00:27:27,294 --> 00:27:29,294
 Can we please talk?

337
00:27:36,194 --> 00:27:38,004

Okay, got it.

338
00:27:47,284 --> 00:27:48,844
 Jang Mi Ho

339
00:28:35,524 --> 00:28:37,134
Welcome.

340
00:28:42,614 --> 00:28:44,394
 VIP Client Desk 
 This is the perfect product for you, Customer.

341
00:28:44,394 --> 00:28:46,884
Deputy Manager Hwang said to contact you first.

342
00:28:46,884 --> 00:28:47,954
Hello.

343
00:28:47,954 --> 00:28:50,144
Oh, I see.

344
00:28:50,144 --> 00:28:51,954
Give me a second.

345
00:28:54,014 --> 00:28:57,134
Is Deputy Manager Hwang Ji Hye here?

346
00:28:57,134 --> 00:28:58,884
Have you made an appointment?

347
00:28:58,884 --> 00:29:00,434
N-No, I haven't.

348
00:29:00,434 --> 00:29:03,534
- Wait one second, please.
 - Okay.

349
00:29:09,964 --> 00:29:12,154
Yes, Customer, that's right.

350
00:29:12,154 --> 00:29:16,134
These are much better offers than before.

351
00:29:17,034 --> 00:29:20,904
Should I book you in for an appointment? When's a good time?

352
00:29:21,974 --> 00:29:23,964
Wednesday before noon?

353
00:29:26,734 --> 00:29:29,264
Yes. All right.

354
00:29:33,144 --> 00:29:36,544
Do you know when Deputy Manager Hwang Ji Hye's coming?

355
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:40,794
I'm sorry. Maybe try calling her.

356
00:29:40,794 --> 00:29:42,544
Oh, okay.

357
00:29:42,544 --> 00:29:44,814
Sorry for holding, I was with a customer.

358
00:29:44,814 --> 00:29:46,204
Yes, sure.

359
00:29:49,044 --> 00:29:52,264
 Assistant Manager Jang Mi Ho 
 That's right. All right.

360
00:29:52,264 --> 00:29:54,294
Okay, all right.

361
00:29:55,784 --> 00:29:57,794
Looks like Deputy Manager Hwang left her phone here.

362
00:29:57,794 --> 00:29:59,174
Ah...

363
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:04,474
Deputy Manager Hwang!

364
00:30:06,894 --> 00:30:07,674
Yes?

365
00:30:07,674 --> 00:30:09,404
-  Where are you?  
- I'm coming in.

366
00:30:09,404 --> 00:30:11,384
 A customer's been waiting for you.

367
00:30:11,384 --> 00:30:13,724
Who? Ms. Jeong?

368
00:30:13,724 --> 00:30:15,414
 I've never seen her before.

369
00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:17,544
 She didn't make an appointment.

370
00:30:20,004 --> 00:30:22,224
What does she look like?

371
00:30:22,224 --> 00:30:24,564
She's a young woman.

372
00:30:26,864 --> 00:30:28,284
Okay.

373
00:30:34,054 --> 00:30:36,394
Does Deputy Manager Hwang have two phones?

374
00:30:36,394 --> 00:30:38,154
Well...

375
00:30:38,154 --> 00:30:40,404
She uses a work phone.

376
00:30:40,404 --> 00:30:43,224
But only a handful of people know.

377
00:30:43,224 --> 00:30:46,334
I can't tell you her phone number...

378
00:30:53,454 --> 00:30:58,384
 Let's trade. I'll give you what you want.

379
00:31:09,904 --> 00:31:12,384
 Yu Jin was that cafe's staff.

380
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:14,214
 Yu Jin?

381
00:31:14,214 --> 00:31:19,354
 She probably had the most dirt on moms in this neighborhood.

382
00:31:22,284 --> 00:31:24,624
 What're you doing right now?

383
00:31:27,994 --> 00:31:30,374
 Hey, why did you lock this?

384
00:31:30,374 --> 00:31:33,304
 010-972-4345

385
00:31:52,534 --> 00:31:53,964
 I wonder what's taking so long.

386
00:31:53,964 --> 00:31:56,604
She said she was walking in.

387
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,784
Thank you.

388
00:32:18,154 --> 00:32:19,994
Have you seen Deputy Manager Hwang Ji Ye?

389
00:32:19,994 --> 00:32:21,374
I haven't.

390
00:32:22,164 --> 00:32:23,804
Thank you.

391
00:33:21,154 --> 00:33:23,134
Deputy Manager.

392
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:25,424
Deputy Manager! Deputy Manager!

393
00:33:35,894 --> 00:33:40,044
Deputy Manager, please talk to me. When will you stop avoiding me?

394
00:33:40,044 --> 00:33:41,984
L-Let go of me.

395
00:33:41,984 --> 00:33:44,504
Deputy Manager, it's you, right? The person who sent the text about the deal.

396
00:33:44,504 --> 00:33:47,074
Were you also the one who left the package?

397
00:33:48,834 --> 00:33:51,684
Let's really make a deal this time.

398
00:34:00,634 --> 00:34:02,264
Did you see it?

399
00:34:05,044 --> 00:34:10,244
No. I know what Yu Jin's collected in this. But!

400
00:34:10,914 --> 00:34:12,534
I didn't even look into your folder, Deputy Manager.

401
00:34:12,534 --> 00:34:14,184
I don't plan on looking, either.

402
00:34:14,184 --> 00:34:16,134
I'm not even curious.

403
00:34:16,984 --> 00:34:19,484
Why are you doing this to me?

404
00:34:19,484 --> 00:34:21,134
That's my question.

405
00:34:21,134 --> 00:34:24,394
How much do you know, and how involved are you in all of this?

406
00:34:25,454 --> 00:34:28,214
I'll erase your folder in here.

407
00:34:28,214 --> 00:34:30,634
So please tell me the truth.

408
00:34:34,934 --> 00:34:36,624
You liar.

409
00:34:38,454 --> 00:34:40,774
There's no way you didn't see.

410
00:34:40,774 --> 00:34:42,764
What deal?

411
00:34:43,994 --> 00:34:49,404
Y-You either know everything or are here to threaten me!

412
00:34:51,954 --> 00:34:55,944
You're here to threaten me!

413
00:35:02,614 --> 00:35:04,824
My So Won...

414
00:35:06,144 --> 00:35:08,234
She's adopted...

415
00:35:11,764 --> 00:35:13,784
but...

416
00:35:13,784 --> 00:35:17,014
I birthed her with my heart.

417
00:35:42,734 --> 00:35:46,074
 I know the world's changed a lot now.

418
00:35:46,074 --> 00:35:52,504
But we promised to keep it a secret from So Won forever.

419
00:35:54,324 --> 00:35:56,974
No matter what others say, that's our decision.

420
00:36:00,034 --> 00:36:04,514
I even quit my previous stock company job in order to adopt So Won.

421
00:36:04,514 --> 00:36:07,094
Because I didn't want to submit adoption papers.

422
00:36:07,094 --> 00:36:11,444
I got a job at the bank since I had work experience.

423
00:36:15,274 --> 00:36:18,994
But, with Yu Jin,

424
00:36:18,994 --> 00:36:23,304
everything went south when Yu Jin and I fell out over the performance.

425
00:36:25,024 --> 00:36:28,114
 Excuse me, what do you mean Ji Yool got hit by the magic wand?

426
00:36:28,114 --> 00:36:31,324
 The magic wand didn't even touch Ji Yool.

427
00:36:31,324 --> 00:36:34,554
 I didn't expect an apology, but this is disappointing.

428
00:36:34,554 --> 00:36:37,504
 It's not like the truth will change by insisting.

429
00:36:40,024 --> 00:36:44,384
 But I understand why you want to believe that.

430
00:36:45,554 --> 00:36:49,274
I spread some rumors out of spite.

431
00:36:50,134 --> 00:36:55,314
After some time, Yu Jin came to this cafe.

432
00:36:57,974 --> 00:37:00,724

Of course I know So Won's mom.

433
00:37:05,554 --> 00:37:08,084
A while ago, at a mothers gathering,

434
00:37:08,084 --> 00:37:11,704
they talked about friends they met at a postpartum care center.

435
00:37:12,794 --> 00:37:17,134
I talked about a mom I met at the adoption facility instead.

436
00:37:18,374 --> 00:37:24,084
But I-I wonder how she knew about that.

437
00:37:27,634 --> 00:37:30,614
I don't intend to threaten you, Ms. Hwang,

438
00:37:30,614 --> 00:37:32,734
nor do I plan to spread this.

439
00:37:32,734 --> 00:37:39,054
I was just curious to know why you took the package and returned it later.

440
00:37:39,054 --> 00:37:41,334
A package?

441
00:37:41,334 --> 00:37:45,084
You keep mentioning this package.

442
00:37:45,084 --> 00:37:47,594
What package are you talking about?

443
00:37:52,844 --> 00:37:54,704
What is this?

444
00:37:56,674 --> 00:38:01,004
Didn't you leave this in front of Yu Jin's house a week ago?

445
00:38:05,084 --> 00:38:09,074
Th-That... is me.

446
00:38:09,804 --> 00:38:12,464
No, I never left something like this.

447
00:38:12,464 --> 00:38:18,154
That day, I went to the 15th floor to see the mom of So Won's friend.

448
00:38:19,494 --> 00:38:21,514
It's true.

449
00:38:23,014 --> 00:38:26,464
O-Oh, right...

450
00:38:26,464 --> 00:38:29,084
On my way down on the elevator,

451
00:38:29,084 --> 00:38:33,234
Min Seong's father got on at the 10th floor.

452
00:38:33,234 --> 00:38:36,504
What? Jeong Su Bin?

453
00:38:44,774 --> 00:38:48,004
- Really?
 - Yeah.

454
00:38:48,004 --> 00:38:52,474
I forgot about it, but I remember now that you asked.

455
00:38:54,254 --> 00:38:55,364
 Kang Do Joon

456
00:38:55,364 --> 00:38:58,734
And? Did Jeong Su Bin pick up Kang Do Joon's call?

457
00:38:58,734 --> 00:39:00,194
What did they talk about?

458
00:39:00,194 --> 00:39:02,054
If I say this, I might—

459
00:39:02,054 --> 00:39:04,894
Deputy Manager! This is really important.

460
00:39:04,894 --> 00:39:07,384
What did the two of them talk about?

461
00:39:09,664 --> 00:39:11,144
I don't know for sure.

462
00:39:11,144 --> 00:39:13,844
I just heard one thing.

463
00:39:16,314 --> 00:39:18,214
 Oh Yu Jin—

464
00:39:28,054 --> 00:39:32,624
I-I really didn't say anything wrong, right?

465
00:39:32,624 --> 00:39:36,384
You can never tell Jeong Su Bin that I said anything.

466
00:39:36,384 --> 00:39:37,864
Got it?

467
00:39:40,604 --> 00:39:43,724
Why? I need to check

468
00:39:43,724 --> 00:39:46,244
if you're telling the truth or not.

469
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:51,204
Deputy Manager, I don't think you would tell a foul lie

470
00:39:51,204 --> 00:39:54,624
to get out of this situation.

471
00:40:08,764 --> 00:40:11,214
- Ms. Hwang.
 - What!

472
00:40:12,944 --> 00:40:15,234
I received this for you.

473
00:40:20,174 --> 00:40:22,564
 Money Credit Lender / Urgent Notice

474
00:40:27,504 --> 00:40:29,704
It's an advertisement.

475
00:40:29,704 --> 00:40:31,824
Oh, right?

476
00:40:31,824 --> 00:40:33,864
I wondered what it was.

477
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:37,104
That lender is really bad at marketing.

478
00:40:37,104 --> 00:40:39,944
How could they send an advertisement to someone like you, Deputy Manager?

479
00:40:39,944 --> 00:40:44,424
If they just looked at the address, they would know what kind of building you live in.

480
00:40:44,424 --> 00:40:46,124
You're right.

481
00:40:46,124 --> 00:40:49,694
Not in the world of silver spoons,

482
00:40:49,694 --> 00:40:54,634
but the person I envy the most in reality is you, Ms. Hwang.

483
00:40:56,444 --> 00:40:59,804
To be honest, being a silver spoon is a talent.

484
00:40:59,804 --> 00:41:02,204
As long as you're talented, you can do it, too.

485
00:41:02,204 --> 00:41:05,634
Gosh, that would be great.

486
00:41:11,154 --> 00:41:15,174
Yes, I need to meet with him as soon as possible.

487
00:41:15,174 --> 00:41:17,014
C-Could you tell me?

488
00:41:17,014 --> 00:41:19,454
You're so pretty!

489
00:41:20,654 --> 00:41:22,584
Please look at the camera.

490
00:41:24,574 --> 00:41:27,154
Jeong Su Bin's contact information?

491
00:41:27,154 --> 00:41:30,904
It's not hard to tell you, but don't let Jeong Ah know.

492
00:41:30,904 --> 00:41:33,124
She won't sit back if she finds out.

493
00:41:33,674 --> 00:41:36,834
It's because of Yu Jin, right?

494
00:41:43,074 --> 00:41:45,534
I'll send it to you right now.

495
00:41:45,534 --> 00:41:46,504
 Min Seong's Father

496
00:41:47,494 --> 00:41:49,604
 Here's Jeong Su Bin's contact.

497
00:41:50,634 --> 00:41:52,434

Thank you.

498
00:42:00,934 --> 00:42:03,324
Congratulations on the wedding.

499
00:42:03,324 --> 00:42:05,684
You must be so happy.

500
00:42:06,804 --> 00:42:08,834
Your statement...

501
00:42:08,834 --> 00:42:10,054
No.

502
00:42:10,054 --> 00:42:12,334
I'm here to listen.

503
00:42:12,334 --> 00:42:15,414
Gosh, the bouquet's so pretty.

504
00:42:15,414 --> 00:42:17,744
Can I catch it?

505
00:42:36,584 --> 00:42:37,794
 Jeong Su Bin (Min Seong's Father)

506
00:42:45,634 --> 00:42:48,414
 The call is not going through. After the beep...

507
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:01,404
 President Jeong Su Bin

508
00:43:08,894 --> 00:43:10,894
 Don't let Jeong Ah know.

509
00:43:10,894 --> 00:43:12,674
 She won't sit back if she finds out.

510
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:13,504
 CEO Office

511
00:43:16,514 --> 00:43:20,044

This is Jang Mi Ho. If you're free, could we meet tonight?

512
00:43:20,044 --> 00:43:22,694
 I can meet you on the 3rd floor of the underground parking lot.

513
00:43:22,694 --> 00:43:24,884
 Does 8 pm work?

514
00:43:33,004 --> 00:43:34,174
Yes, hello?

515
00:43:34,174 --> 00:43:36,664
 It's me, Marilyn.

516
00:43:37,624 --> 00:43:41,714
 I'm going to Seoul later. Do you have time?

517
00:43:41,714 --> 00:43:44,054
Why do you want to see me?

518
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:46,524
 I can tell you when we meet.

519
00:43:46,524 --> 00:43:49,964
 Anyway, let's meet at the apartment where Yu Jin used to live.

520
00:43:52,084 --> 00:43:55,194
7:30 pm, no. I'll see you at 7 pm.

521
00:44:41,514 --> 00:44:43,644
I didn't find anything.

522
00:44:43,644 --> 00:44:45,624
He's clean. Really clean.

523
00:44:45,624 --> 00:44:48,254
- Really?
 - Yes, really.

524
00:44:48,254 --> 00:44:51,654
Wait, what did you see, Noonim?

525
00:44:51,654 --> 00:44:55,144
Did you think your husband was cheating?

526
00:44:55,144 --> 00:44:57,624
That's none of your business.

527
00:44:58,434 --> 00:44:59,944
Are you sure you looked into this thoroughly?

528
00:44:59,944 --> 00:45:01,684
I guarantee it.

529
00:45:01,684 --> 00:45:03,754
This isn't the first time you've worked with me.

530
00:45:03,754 --> 00:45:08,774
So, don't worry about anything, and treat your husband to a nice dinner.

531
00:45:34,924 --> 00:45:36,924
 Manager Gong Chang Hyeon

532
00:45:41,624 --> 00:45:44,144
 Pay up, as you promised.

533
00:45:44,144 --> 00:45:48,164
Also, I'll send you the recording of the conversation with Noonim.

534
00:45:48,164 --> 00:45:49,934
Check that I've covered for you.

535
00:45:49,934 --> 00:45:51,484
H-Hold on.

536
00:45:52,434 --> 00:45:55,734
- No matter what, I think—
  - You had a wild past.

537
00:45:56,924 --> 00:46:01,624
And why did you meet so frequently with Oh Yu Jin before she died?

538
00:46:01,624 --> 00:46:05,334
I said I had nothing to do with her!

539
00:46:10,854 --> 00:46:13,114
Crazy assholes.

540
00:46:15,234 --> 00:46:16,814
 Didn't you say I'm on my own now?

541
00:46:16,814 --> 00:46:19,544
 I need to find a way to eat and live, don't I?

542
00:46:27,184 --> 00:46:28,644
 Jeong Su Bin

543
00:46:28,644 --> 00:46:31,954
You son of a bitch. How dare you stab me in the back?

544
00:46:31,954 --> 00:46:34,104
N-No, it's not that. Noonim—

545
00:46:34,104 --> 00:46:35,354
What is it?

546
00:46:35,354 --> 00:46:39,634
What were you covering for Su Bin to rip off his money?

547
00:46:44,074 --> 00:46:45,774
Gosh, Noonim.

548
00:46:50,594 --> 00:46:52,324
 Pay up, as you promised.

549
00:46:52,324 --> 00:46:55,104
 I'll send you the recording of the conversation with Noonim,

550
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:56,654
 so check that I've covered for you.

551
00:46:56,654 --> 00:46:58,534
 H-Hold on, no matter what, I think—

552
00:46:58,534 --> 00:47:01,194
 You had a wild past.

553
00:47:01,194 --> 00:47:04,724
 And why did you meet so frequently with Oh Yu Jin before she died?

554
00:47:04,724 --> 00:47:08,294
 I said I have nothing to do with her!

555
00:47:12,544 --> 00:47:16,934
What do you mean Su Bin and Oh Yu Jin met frequently?

556
00:47:19,464 --> 00:47:21,614
Should I call Song Jeong Sik?

557
00:47:23,414 --> 00:47:25,444
Damn it.

558
00:47:25,444 --> 00:47:27,704
I don't really know, either.

559
00:47:27,704 --> 00:47:31,284
The two used to meet often before she died.

560
00:47:31,284 --> 00:47:34,464
Jeong Sik happened to see them.

561
00:47:34,464 --> 00:47:35,874
Why'd the two meet?

562
00:47:35,874 --> 00:47:39,654
It seemed like she found some dirt on Jeong Su Bin.

563
00:47:40,304 --> 00:47:46,584
On that topic, is Jeong Su Bin involved in that woman's death?

564
00:47:47,794 --> 00:47:49,744
Shut your damn mouth.

565
00:47:54,564 --> 00:47:58,254
 December 15th, 2022, The Day of Oh Yu Jin's Death

566
00:47:58,914 --> 00:48:00,034
Where's Su Bin?

567
00:48:00,034 --> 00:48:01,944
How would I know?

568
00:48:09,214 --> 00:48:11,784
Where the heck is he?

569
00:48:25,824 --> 00:48:29,664
That bast... Don't trust Jeong Su Bin too much!

570
00:48:31,604 --> 00:48:35,684
That bastard, he planned to trick you.

571
00:48:35,684 --> 00:48:38,534
Jeong Sik tried so hard to stop you.

572
00:48:38,534 --> 00:48:43,634
Noonim, you might not know what kind of shit he did.

573
00:48:48,864 --> 00:48:50,944
 CEO Song Jeong Ah

574
00:49:03,474 --> 00:49:04,584
 Bankbook

575
00:49:07,274 --> 00:49:10,434
 820,304,200 won

576
00:49:15,944 --> 00:49:19,454
 This is Jang Mi Ho. If you're free, could we meet tonight?

577
00:49:19,454 --> 00:49:22,114
 I can meet you on the 3rd floor of the underground parking lot.

578
00:49:22,114 --> 00:49:24,394
 Does 8 pm work?

579
00:49:55,204 --> 00:49:59,334
Don't worry. Twenty million won is nothing to pay back.

580
00:50:00,604 --> 00:50:03,134
I have my reasons.

581
00:50:08,174 --> 00:50:11,454
I'm here. I'll talk to you later.

582
00:50:14,874 --> 00:50:16,504
 Where are you?

583
00:50:16,504 --> 00:50:19,044

Let's meet in front of Building 151.

584
00:50:38,714 --> 00:50:41,974
Wow, it's really amazing.

585
00:50:41,974 --> 00:50:44,214
My daughter's old apartment.

586
00:50:44,214 --> 00:50:45,594
You wanted to see me?

587
00:50:45,594 --> 00:50:47,544
Why the rush?

588
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,994
Let's take our time.

589
00:50:53,504 --> 00:50:56,214
Hey, you, do you have some money?

590
00:50:59,004 --> 00:51:03,484
I know a few things.

591
00:51:03,484 --> 00:51:05,604
For me to speak,

592
00:51:06,574 --> 00:51:09,044
I'll need some of this.

593
00:51:18,974 --> 00:51:20,084
H-Hello.

594
00:51:20,084 --> 00:51:22,414
O-Oh, hello.

595
00:51:31,554 --> 00:51:32,844
 Jang Mi Ho

596
00:51:34,084 --> 00:51:35,964
 Did you meet with Min Seong's father?

597
00:51:35,964 --> 00:51:39,654
 I'm in the elevator with him, and he seems to be going home.

598
00:51:40,274 --> 00:51:43,704
 No, I haven't. Can you stall Jeong Su Bin on the 18th floor?

599
00:51:43,704 --> 00:51:45,564
 I'll be right there.

600
00:52:01,194 --> 00:52:06,004
O-Oh, Min Seong's Father, could you come with me?

601
00:52:06,004 --> 00:52:08,364
I have something for Min Seong.

602
00:52:11,524 --> 00:52:14,574
You know how it is between Eonni and me lately.

603
00:52:14,574 --> 00:52:17,114
I bought it a while ago and wanted to give it to him.

604
00:52:17,114 --> 00:52:19,264
W-Well, okay.

605
00:52:19,264 --> 00:52:21,044
Shall we?

606
00:52:23,214 --> 00:52:26,234
What do you think? You get the information you want,

607
00:52:26,234 --> 00:52:29,294
and I get the money I want.

608
00:52:29,294 --> 00:52:31,084
I think it's fair.

609
00:52:31,084 --> 00:52:33,864
So what's that information?

610
00:52:35,354 --> 00:52:39,974
Yu Jin came to me about a week before she died

611
00:52:39,974 --> 00:52:42,714
after not contacting me for years.

612
00:52:44,674 --> 00:52:47,234
 She handed me a key.

613
00:52:47,234 --> 00:52:50,224
 She said her life was in there.

614
00:52:50,944 --> 00:52:55,214
 She said to give it to the police if anything were to happen to her.

615
00:52:55,944 --> 00:52:58,594
Then, she told me to get rid of it.

616
00:52:58,594 --> 00:53:00,554
I kept it for a few days.

617
00:53:00,554 --> 00:53:04,114
I didn't know what it was for and felt uneasy.

618
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:07,224
So, I just sent it back to her.

619
00:53:07,844 --> 00:53:10,104
But that happened to be...

620
00:53:10,704 --> 00:53:13,164
the day before Yu Jin died.

621
00:53:13,164 --> 00:53:16,744
The next day, I got a text that the package was delivered.

622
00:53:16,744 --> 00:53:19,244
You know what time that was?

623
00:53:23,164 --> 00:53:24,794
The rest of the story isn't free.

624
00:53:24,794 --> 00:53:28,384
I also know that someone was there the day Yu Jin died.

625
00:53:28,384 --> 00:53:30,894
And that person took the package, too.

626
00:53:32,614 --> 00:53:35,284
Are you making deals with Yu Jin's life?

627
00:53:35,284 --> 00:53:38,314
- Who told you?
 - Is that important?

628
00:53:38,314 --> 00:53:40,504
You said not knowing was a sin.

629
00:53:40,504 --> 00:53:43,564
So how could someone who calls herself a biological mother

630
00:53:43,564 --> 00:53:45,364
be so crude?

631
00:53:45,364 --> 00:53:47,204
What about it?

632
00:53:47,204 --> 00:53:49,264
She's already dead and gone.

633
00:53:49,264 --> 00:53:53,274
I don't intend on buying that kind of information. So, get lost.

634
00:53:53,274 --> 00:53:56,134
Do you know why Yu Jin died?

635
00:54:05,024 --> 00:54:10,104
You can't find out anything without me.

636
00:54:25,474 --> 00:54:27,034
What now?

637
00:54:27,034 --> 00:54:31,624
Jang Mi Ho knows that someone was there that night.

638
00:54:31,624 --> 00:54:35,134
What about it? The investigation's already over.

639
00:54:35,134 --> 00:54:38,034
 Do you think Jang Mi Ho will give up?

640
00:54:39,144 --> 00:54:41,880
Seems like you don't want her to give up.

641
00:54:43,174 --> 00:54:44,924
Look.

642
00:54:44,924 --> 00:54:47,574
We have nothing to do with one another anymore.

643
00:54:47,574 --> 00:54:49,764
So, let's end it here.

644
00:54:59,314 --> 00:55:00,894

Where are you? Why aren't you home?

645
00:55:00,894 --> 00:55:05,964
 On the 18th floor. Ah Rin's mom said she has something for Min Seong.

646
00:55:07,694 --> 00:55:11,494

Where are you? Min Seong's father's in front of my house.

647
00:55:22,314 --> 00:55:24,034
W-Well, I have to go.

648
00:55:24,034 --> 00:55:25,504
I just need a second.

649
00:55:25,504 --> 00:55:27,814
Wait. Wait a second...

650
00:55:27,814 --> 00:55:32,084
Did you leave this at Yu Jin's house, Jeong Su Bin?

651
00:55:32,084 --> 00:55:35,444
What? I don't know what you're talking about.

652
00:55:35,444 --> 00:55:38,454
Someone saw you a week ago on the 10th floor, Jeong Su Bin.

653
00:55:38,454 --> 00:55:40,114
Did you leave it then?

654
00:55:40,114 --> 00:55:41,934
Gosh, what're you saying?

655
00:55:41,934 --> 00:55:43,864
I never did that.

656
00:55:45,484 --> 00:55:47,914
What's relationship did you have with Yu Jin?

657
00:55:52,104 --> 00:55:54,484
- Then Kang Do Joon—
 - That person and I

658
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:56,384
have nothing between us!

659
00:55:56,384 --> 00:55:59,114
Nothing happened!

660
00:56:00,304 --> 00:56:03,194
With Kang Do Joon?

661
00:56:04,844 --> 00:56:06,224
What?

662
00:56:20,854 --> 00:56:23,314
I had a bad feeling. What are you doing?

663
00:56:23,314 --> 00:56:26,084
Are you going as far as bothering my husband now?

664
00:56:26,084 --> 00:56:28,114
What grudge do you have against my family?

665
00:56:28,114 --> 00:56:30,244
Song Jeong Ah.

666
00:56:30,244 --> 00:56:34,154
The day Yu Jin died, do you know where your husband was?

667
00:56:39,534 --> 00:56:44,084
Why are you people so afraid of getting caught doing?

668
00:56:44,084 --> 00:56:46,224
You wouldn't have to if you were innocent.

669
00:56:46,224 --> 00:56:49,444
That has nothing to do with me!

670
00:56:49,444 --> 00:56:53,084
Don't approach my husband ever again.

671
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:09,754
Avoid Jang Mi Ho from now on.

672
00:57:09,754 --> 00:57:11,814
Nothing good comes from it.

673
00:57:14,044 --> 00:57:15,824
Su Bin.

674
00:57:17,994 --> 00:57:19,854
Where were you?

675
00:57:19,854 --> 00:57:21,774
The day Yu Jin died,

676
00:57:21,774 --> 00:57:24,594
you never picked up the phone and came home late.

677
00:57:25,944 --> 00:57:28,624
Why are you being like this?

678
00:57:28,624 --> 00:57:30,584
- I was with a friend. 
- Which friend?

679
00:57:30,584 --> 00:57:34,044
- You don't know!
 - What don't I know?

680
00:57:35,154 --> 00:57:37,284
You're hiding something from me.

681
00:57:37,284 --> 00:57:40,234
If that's what's troubling you right now, you can tell me.

682
00:57:40,234 --> 00:57:43,954
- I can solve—
 - Just stop it!

683
00:57:43,954 --> 00:57:45,724
Am I a kid?

684
00:57:46,494 --> 00:57:51,124
Why do you always make me into someone who's incapable of doing anything myself?

685
00:57:51,124 --> 00:57:53,814
I take care of my own problems!

686
00:58:23,804 --> 00:58:27,394
 Searching for the location

687
00:58:27,394 --> 00:58:29,064
Cheers.

688
00:58:32,754 --> 00:58:35,364
Congratulations! You're free!

689
00:58:35,364 --> 00:58:38,954
It's all thanks to you, Attorney Lee.

690
00:58:39,844 --> 00:58:41,564
Okay...

691
00:58:41,564 --> 00:58:45,024
But really, what actually happened that day?

692
00:58:45,024 --> 00:58:48,034
Can't you tell me now?

693
00:58:51,104 --> 00:58:53,344
I already told you.

694
00:58:53,344 --> 00:58:55,314
That's the truth.

695
00:58:55,314 --> 00:58:57,084
Stop playing dumb.

696
00:58:57,084 --> 00:59:00,314
You should tell the truth to your attorney by now.

697
00:59:00,314 --> 00:59:03,474
So I can prepare for unexpected emergencies.

698
00:59:06,624 --> 00:59:10,604
Well, I'm not drunk enough.

699
00:59:13,724 --> 00:59:15,624
Here you go...

700
00:59:27,294 --> 00:59:29,564
Lee Tae Ho...

701
00:59:29,564 --> 00:59:32,064
Should I tell you the truth?

702
00:59:36,244 --> 00:59:38,734
I wonder if you can handle it.

703
00:59:39,874 --> 00:59:41,784
Let's hear it.

704
00:59:48,774 --> 00:59:50,594
I stabbed her.

705
00:59:54,254 --> 00:59:57,444
I stabbed Yu Jin.

706
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:33,430

707
01:00:38,744 --> 01:00:44,734
♫  A page tainted with lies  ♫

708
01:00:44,734 --> 01:00:50,334
♫  Truth doesn't exist there  ♫

709
01:00:50,334 --> 01:00:57,594
♫  Every moment is growing faint  ♫

710
01:00:57,594 --> 01:01:02,154
♫  A game full of confusion  ♫

711
01:01:03,494 --> 01:01:09,544
♫  Something's wrong, wake me up from my blindfolded eyes  ♫

712
01:01:09,544 --> 01:01:16,264
♫  It's over, I can't hide it anymore  ♫

713
01:01:16,264 --> 01:01:21,704
♫  The broken trust, the hidden anxieties  ♫

714
01:01:21,704 --> 01:01:25,314
 Battle For Happiness

715
01:01:25,314 --> 01:01:26,954
 What do you want to know from me?

716
01:01:26,954 --> 01:01:31,294
 Do you think Jeong Su Bin was threatened by Oh Yu Jin and killed her?

717
01:01:31,294 --> 01:01:32,814
 Do you know something?

718
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:34,584
 This isn't the end.

719
01:01:34,584 --> 01:01:36,904
 Although it's a dismissed case,

720
01:01:36,904 --> 01:01:39,484
 if someone's persistent,

721
01:01:39,484 --> 01:01:41,574
 they might find a crucial lead.

722
01:01:41,574 --> 01:01:44,294
 Did you draw this, Ji Yool?

723
01:01:45,914 --> 01:01:51,194
♫  True or lie, true or lie, walk away from this game  ♫

724
01:01:51,194 --> 01:01:52,954
 And take this case to your grave.

725
01:01:55,074 --> 01:01:56,564
 Did you see it?

726
01:02:00,474 --> 01:02:03,674
 I should suspect Deputy Manager Hwang Ji Hye rather than Jeong Su Bin?

727
01:02:03,674 --> 01:02:06,774
 Most motives for murder are usually maligned love, resentment,

728
01:02:06,774 --> 01:02:08,834
 or money.

729
01:02:13,634 --> 01:02:14,644
 Are you crazy?

730
01:02:14,644 --> 01:02:17,604
 I'll do anything to protect my family.

731
01:02:19,504 --> 01:02:21,654
 I need to see with my own eyes

732
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:25,974
 if it's Jeong Soo Bin or Ms. Hwang who meets with Kang Do Joon.
