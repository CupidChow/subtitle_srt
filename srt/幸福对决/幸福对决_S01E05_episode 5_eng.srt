Oh, that's right. I didn't put this away.

12
00:01:03,924 --> 00:01:05,804
 I'm sick and tired of your delusional jealousy!

13
00:01:05,804 --> 00:01:08,110
 Why do you talk as if it's all my fault?

14
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,510
 - This is all because of you!
 - That's enough!

It's late. Shouldn't you be going?

00:01:32,864 --> 00:01:35,774
Were they having an affair?

What exactly happened over there?

33
00:04:06,374 --> 00:04:09,994
Never mind. I should go get...

34
00:04:34,694 --> 00:04:36,894
- Great work.
 - Take care.

35
00:04:36,894 --> 00:04:38,974
- It was great.
 - Bye.

36
00:04:38,974 --> 00:04:40,164
Thank you. Get home safely.

37
00:04:40,164 --> 00:04:42,644

 - Goodbye.

If there's good news, please let us know.

00:04:45,094 --> 00:04:46,524
Of course.

40
00:04:46,524 --> 00:04:48,314
I'll send the details by email.

41
00:04:48,314 --> 00:04:50,514
Yes, I'll be looking out for it.

42

 - Thank you so much. Get home safely.

44
00:04:55,234 --> 00:04:57,234
- We had a great time.
 - Goodbye.

 - Let's go.

I was right, wasn't I?

47
00:05:10,704 --> 00:05:13,904
I told you people would be fighting to invest.

48
00:05:13,904 --> 00:05:16,704
They'll be desperate for it.

49
00:05:16,704 --> 00:05:18,224
You're right.

50
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:24,574
They're looking at the future potential of our company.

51
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,564
So don't make such a face.

52
00:05:26,564 --> 00:05:29,384
You just get ready for the investor presentation.

53
00:05:29,384 --> 00:05:32,824
Trust me and do what I say.

00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:46,944
Huh? Yeah.

Hey, Jeong Sik.

59
00:05:50,264 --> 00:05:53,764
Can I call you back later?

60
00:05:53,764 --> 00:05:54,874
Yeah.

61
00:05:54,874 --> 00:05:57,094
Yeah. Okay.

62
00:06:00,124 --> 00:06:02,444
You've been hanging out with Song Jeong Sik a lot lately.

63
00:06:02,444 --> 00:06:04,724
He wants to talk to me about something.

64
00:06:04,724 --> 00:06:06,574
About what?

65
00:06:08,774 --> 00:06:11,424
It's his personal matter.

66
00:06:13,854 --> 00:06:15,964
You really won't tell me?

67
00:06:18,894 --> 00:06:20,514
 Ms. Jo.

68
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:22,674
 Getting off work now?

69
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,574
 I'm meeting someone around here.

70
00:06:24,574 --> 00:06:25,974
 Noona!

71
00:06:25,974 --> 00:06:28,174
 I had a drink with Su Bin.

72
00:06:28,174 --> 00:06:30,894
 But he was too drunk, so I walked him home.

73
00:06:34,104 --> 00:06:36,324
Is he talking to you about girls?

74
00:06:36,324 --> 00:06:38,784
Gosh, no.

75
00:06:41,044 --> 00:06:43,394
This is unbelievable.

76
00:06:46,784 --> 00:06:51,374
Mr. Han, how did the follow request to Ms. Jo Ah Ra go?

77
00:06:51,374 --> 00:06:54,624
Oh, yeah? Send me the ID and password.

78
00:06:54,624 --> 00:06:57,694
 CEO Song, the ID is junjun_han90 and the password is han900308

79
00:06:57,694 --> 00:07:00,224
Very well hidden.

80
00:07:00,224 --> 00:07:02,964
As if I wouldn't see it.

81
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:06,844
 It's not that I want it all.

82
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:09,474
That's mine.

83
00:07:09,474 --> 00:07:12,174
That's Na Yeong's.

84
00:07:12,174 --> 00:07:14,274
Is this So Min's?

85
00:07:16,274 --> 00:07:20,324
What a copycat. She bought everything we have.

86
00:07:23,244 --> 00:07:27,254
 My man says, "Being with you makes me feel like I own the world."

87
00:07:27,254 --> 00:07:29,374
 Oppa, you already have my whole world.

88
00:07:29,374 --> 00:07:30,564
 Let's come back here after we're married.

89
00:07:30,564 --> 00:07:32,514
 Oh, you have a new bracelet.

90
00:07:32,514 --> 00:07:35,204
 Oh, yes. I received it as a gift.

91
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,384
 From who? Your boyfriend?

92
00:07:37,384 --> 00:07:39,834
 So you did see him last night.

93
00:07:42,844 --> 00:07:45,114
"Oppa."

94
00:07:46,384 --> 00:07:48,844
Babe, what's up? You're still in your work clothes.

95
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,524
Does Jeong Sik ask you for money these days?

96
00:07:54,524 --> 00:07:55,734
What?

97
00:07:56,394 --> 00:07:57,794
N-No...

98
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:00,794
You'd better behave, Honey.

99
00:08:00,794 --> 00:08:04,324
You know he's just been into his studies, so he's naive.

100
00:08:04,324 --> 00:08:06,844
Let's see if he loses his money somewhere and gets caught.

101
00:08:06,844 --> 00:08:08,294
I won't let you off the hook, either.

102
00:08:08,294 --> 00:08:10,074
What...

103
00:08:11,964 --> 00:08:13,504
Fine.

104
00:08:13,504 --> 00:08:15,804
Fine? There you go again.

105
00:08:15,804 --> 00:08:16,934
I won't do it.

106
00:08:16,934 --> 00:08:18,744
Am I saying this for no reason?

107
00:08:18,744 --> 00:08:21,524
You know my family is the most important thing to me.

108
00:08:21,524 --> 00:08:23,844
I'm sorry I made you worry.

109
00:08:24,774 --> 00:08:28,154
I'll take care of it. Okay?

110
00:08:28,154 --> 00:08:29,674
I'm sorry.

111
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:50,954
 You want to leave me, don't you?

112
00:08:50,954 --> 00:08:52,824
 That's all you think about, right?

113
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,684
 But what do I do?

114
00:08:54,684 --> 00:08:57,444
 I won't leave you even if it kills me!

115
00:09:43,734 --> 00:09:46,024
I'm sorry.

116
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,654
You're not too mad at me, are you?

117
00:09:59,034 --> 00:10:03,454
Babe, that woman Jang Mi Ho...

118
00:10:03,454 --> 00:10:07,244
She's threatening me because she thinks I killed Oh Yu Jin.

119
00:10:07,244 --> 00:10:09,764
Isn't that crazy?

120
00:10:09,764 --> 00:10:12,194
Don't let it bother you.

121
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,454
Just cut that woman off.

122
00:10:14,454 --> 00:10:18,024
Right? I should cut her off right away.

123
00:10:19,594 --> 00:10:24,424
Whether it's a relationship or feelings, it's best to cut them off quickly.

124
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:26,004
And you...

125
00:10:32,524 --> 00:10:34,684
agree with me, right?

126
00:10:34,684 --> 00:10:37,724
It was no relationship of importance.

127
00:10:37,724 --> 00:10:39,274
Right?

128
00:10:40,804 --> 00:10:42,234
Right.

129
00:10:44,774 --> 00:10:48,654
Hey, so... when we were at the meeting,

130
00:10:48,654 --> 00:10:51,484
you were obviously the hottest.

131
00:11:27,974 --> 00:11:29,904
Ji Yool, Ha Yool, are you all ready?

132
00:11:29,904 --> 00:11:31,294
We're ready!

133
00:11:31,294 --> 00:11:32,884
Me, too!

134
00:11:32,884 --> 00:11:35,904
You need to pack your backpack, too.

135
00:11:46,614 --> 00:11:48,824
The jewel is here!

136
00:11:48,824 --> 00:11:51,174
You like the jewel, right?

137
00:11:51,174 --> 00:11:53,544
Ha Yool likes the jewel, too.

138
00:11:53,544 --> 00:11:56,154
Keep it safe, okay?

139
00:11:59,264 --> 00:12:02,284
Let's go. We're going to be late.

140
00:12:02,284 --> 00:12:04,024
Let's go.

141
00:12:13,104 --> 00:12:15,954
Hi!

142
00:12:22,084 --> 00:12:24,294
If you're not getting in, we'll go.

143
00:12:36,054 --> 00:12:37,724
Why are you looking at me like that?

144
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:39,674
I wasn't looking at you.

157
00:14:23,664 --> 00:14:26,134
- Assistant Manager.
  -  Jr. Assistant Manager Lee, can you talk?

158
00:14:26,134 --> 00:14:28,154
Of course. What's going on?

159
00:14:28,154 --> 00:14:31,414
I wanted to know how you found that photo yesterday.

160
00:14:31,414 --> 00:14:34,634
 You have no idea how shocked I was.

161
00:14:34,634 --> 00:14:38,974
 My heart was beating so fast when I realized that she saw them.

162
00:14:38,974 --> 00:14:41,934
But Ms. Jang, could this involve...

163
00:14:42,844 --> 00:14:44,334
an affair?

164
00:14:44,334 --> 00:14:46,724
 That couldn't be, right?

165
00:14:49,404 --> 00:14:51,504
They were definitely having an affair.

166
00:14:51,504 --> 00:14:53,364
We don't know yet.

167
00:14:53,364 --> 00:14:56,214
How can I be sure with these vague photos?

168
00:15:02,624 --> 00:15:06,434
If you look around, you might find more evidence.

169
00:15:06,434 --> 00:15:08,784
- I'll handle that.
 - Or meet the guy in the photo...

170
00:15:08,784 --> 00:15:10,774
I'm hanging up, bye.

171
00:15:21,564 --> 00:15:25,224
Mr. Lee, how can you laugh at someone else's misfortune?

172
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:26,884
Whose fault is that?

173
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,714
Yoon Jeong, blame yourself for the worst taste in men.

174
00:15:29,714 --> 00:15:32,904
You told me to try going out with him.

175
00:15:32,904 --> 00:15:35,514
So, is it ultimately my fault?

176
00:15:35,514 --> 00:15:37,064
But what should we do?

177
00:15:37,064 --> 00:15:40,874
I can't take care of you. At least, not now.

178
00:15:53,334 --> 00:15:54,644
I'll get going first.

179
00:15:54,644 --> 00:15:56,464
Take your time.

180
00:15:56,464 --> 00:15:58,534
Enjoy your meal, Yoon Jeong.

181
00:16:01,524 --> 00:16:04,144
He barely ate again.

182
00:16:04,144 --> 00:16:06,404
I wonder if something's up lately.

183
00:16:10,074 --> 00:16:11,694
I understand.

184
00:16:12,454 --> 00:16:13,824
Okay.

185
00:16:15,804 --> 00:16:17,324
Bye.

186
00:16:23,724 --> 00:16:25,094
Hello.

187
00:16:25,094 --> 00:16:28,314
- Welcome. This way, please. 
- Okay.

188
00:16:31,394 --> 00:16:34,224
This feels so good. It's so healing.

189
00:16:34,224 --> 00:16:37,374
It's nice, right?

190
00:16:54,704 --> 00:16:58,064
I feel all of the stress leaving my body.

191
00:16:58,064 --> 00:17:00,794
This is why you look so young, Eonni.

192
00:17:00,794 --> 00:17:03,474
This is just the basics.

193
00:17:08,954 --> 00:17:11,404
You have too much tension in your shoulders.

194
00:17:11,404 --> 00:17:13,484
My shoulders are just fine.

195
00:17:13,484 --> 00:17:15,694
I'm switching this out.

196
00:17:23,844 --> 00:17:26,584
What am I looking at right now?

197
00:17:26,584 --> 00:17:28,524
It's Ms. Jo Ah Ra's day off.

198
00:17:28,524 --> 00:17:31,354
They give resident IDs to the teachers.

199
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:38,434
 aara_joara made a new post

200
00:17:38,434 --> 00:17:40,664
 I started taking golf lessons once a week.

201
00:17:40,664 --> 00:17:43,074
 I'll be able to do a full swing soon. LOL.

202
00:17:43,074 --> 00:17:45,864
 Ah Ra! Wow, you started golfing?

203
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:47,884
 You're not too far from making it.

204
00:17:47,884 --> 00:17:51,094
 It's been so long! So much happened since. LOL.

205
00:17:51,094 --> 00:17:53,214
 I dreamt that I grabbed onto a rope made of gold.

206
00:17:53,214 --> 00:17:54,944
 I think I'm getting in soon.

207
00:17:54,944 --> 00:17:57,984
 Maybe within three months? LOL.

208
00:18:02,234 --> 00:18:03,524
Parking spot?

209
00:18:03,524 --> 00:18:06,174
There are four per household. Which one?

210
00:18:06,174 --> 00:18:07,464
Four? That many?

211
00:18:07,464 --> 00:18:10,264
You asked about the CCTV last time.

212
00:18:10,264 --> 00:18:13,284
It's not that I can't tell you, but...

213
00:18:13,284 --> 00:18:15,214
Why do you ask?

214
00:18:15,214 --> 00:18:18,474
Kim Na Yeong said she had a good parking spot, so I wanted to know where.

215
00:18:18,474 --> 00:18:21,004
Your spot can't be too bad, ma'am.

216
00:18:21,914 --> 00:18:23,834
You haven't registered your car, right?

217
00:18:23,834 --> 00:18:25,284
I'm going to.

218
00:18:25,284 --> 00:18:26,844
Let's see.

219
00:18:28,814 --> 00:18:30,254
 Building 151, Unit 1803

220
00:18:30,254 --> 00:18:32,034
You only have two cars registered.

221
00:18:32,034 --> 00:18:34,554
Manager! Someone is here to see you.

222
00:18:34,554 --> 00:18:36,654
- One moment.
 - Sure.

223
00:18:47,434 --> 00:18:49,874
 Ms. Jang, I didn't finish saying this earlier.

224
00:18:49,874 --> 00:18:53,824
 How about meeting the man in the photo?

225
00:18:53,824 --> 00:18:55,914
 You said the apartment has designated parking spots.

226
00:18:55,914 --> 00:18:58,824
 You could leave a note on his spot.

227
00:19:01,484 --> 00:19:04,694
 Basement level two, area A, number 27.

228
00:19:06,704 --> 00:19:09,904
 Basement level three, area A, number 29.

229
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:28,704
 Hello, Mr. Lee Tae Ho. This is Jang Mi Ho from Unit 1004.

230
00:19:28,704 --> 00:19:30,634
 We met in the emergency room.

231
00:19:30,634 --> 00:19:34,234
 I have a question for you. When you see this note, please call me.

232
00:19:42,364 --> 00:19:45,044
Min Seong's mother picked them both up.

233
00:19:45,044 --> 00:19:47,314
Didn't she call you?

234
00:19:51,784 --> 00:19:54,914
 I'm taking the kids to the kids' cafe. Take your time.

235
00:19:54,914 --> 00:19:56,834
I thought you two had already made arrangements.

236
00:19:56,834 --> 00:19:58,914
Got it, thanks.

237
00:20:06,824 --> 00:20:08,024
 Kids' Cafe]

238
00:20:19,244 --> 00:20:20,884
You guys go ahead.

239
00:20:20,884 --> 00:20:22,634
Okay, Eonni.

240
00:20:25,414 --> 00:20:28,594
Oh, hello, Ms. Song.

241
00:20:29,834 --> 00:20:32,974
I thought it was your day off. I didn't think you'd be here.

242
00:20:32,974 --> 00:20:36,004
Oh, I have plans nearby.

243
00:20:36,004 --> 00:20:38,654
I had some time to kill.

244
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:43,204
Your boyfriend must have gotten you that bracelet.

245
00:20:43,204 --> 00:20:45,284
I didn't even ask for it.

246
00:20:45,284 --> 00:20:47,044
He said it was a surprise.

247
00:20:47,044 --> 00:20:48,584
Is that right?

248
00:20:48,584 --> 00:20:51,114
Who is your big spender boyfriend?

249
00:20:51,114 --> 00:20:53,294
Do I know him?

250
00:20:57,594 --> 00:21:02,164
No. You don't know him, Ms. Song.

251
00:21:04,674 --> 00:21:07,814
I meant to tell you this last time.

252
00:21:07,814 --> 00:21:10,634
Please refrain from wearing jewelry.

253
00:21:10,634 --> 00:21:13,334
It might be dangerous for the kids.

254
00:21:13,334 --> 00:21:15,464
Isn't that just common sense?

255
00:21:15,464 --> 00:21:17,914
Thanks for the feedback,

256
00:21:17,914 --> 00:21:19,814
but I can handle myself.

257
00:21:19,814 --> 00:21:22,264
I take it off at the kindergarten.

258
00:21:22,264 --> 00:21:25,324
I understand why you're worried,

259
00:21:25,324 --> 00:21:28,124
but you're acting a bit superior.

260
00:21:28,974 --> 00:21:31,104
What? Superior?

261
00:21:31,104 --> 00:21:34,434
I have a personal life, you know?

262
00:21:34,434 --> 00:21:39,224
If you keep getting in my business, it's going to be an issue.

263
00:21:39,224 --> 00:21:43,184
The world is unforgiving to entitled people these days, you know?

264
00:21:43,184 --> 00:21:44,784
How can you...

265
00:21:44,784 --> 00:21:46,214
Look, Ms. Jo Ah Ra.

266
00:21:46,214 --> 00:21:51,514
You can't take feedback? Your ego must be too big.

267
00:21:51,514 --> 00:21:53,364
Do you have a strong backer or something?

268
00:21:53,364 --> 00:21:56,124
What are you saying?

269
00:21:58,064 --> 00:22:03,484
One should be self-aware and know their place.

270
00:22:03,484 --> 00:22:06,894
Do you think this looks good on you?

271
00:22:07,894 --> 00:22:10,174
I know how much you want it,

272
00:22:10,174 --> 00:22:12,904
but don't get greedy for other people's things.

273
00:22:12,904 --> 00:22:15,404
How shameful and disgusting.

274
00:22:40,124 --> 00:22:42,244
Are you okay?

275
00:22:42,244 --> 00:22:43,974
Are you okay?

276
00:22:46,384 --> 00:22:47,994
Get up.

277
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,754
 Baek Seong Hui (Eun Han's mother)

278
00:23:02,004 --> 00:23:05,234
 Don't worry, the kids are busy playing.

279
00:23:05,234 --> 00:23:08,724
 All the moms are here, so take your time.

280
00:23:19,084 --> 00:23:21,324
Are you okay?

281
00:23:22,394 --> 00:23:25,044
You should take some medicine or something.

282
00:23:26,974 --> 00:23:30,364
I feel better after throwing up.

283
00:23:30,364 --> 00:23:34,484
- I'm sorry, I have to go. 
- Eonni...

284
00:23:34,484 --> 00:23:36,054
I...

285
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:46,014
I don't have anyone to talk to.

286
00:23:49,014 --> 00:23:54,964
But I thought you might understand my situation, Ms. Jang.

287
00:23:58,494 --> 00:24:01,274
I don't mean to gossip,

288
00:24:02,864 --> 00:24:08,254
but Min Seong's mother is a person with no filter.

289
00:24:08,254 --> 00:24:11,564
Ah Rin's mother is an aggressive person as well.

290
00:24:11,564 --> 00:24:14,224
Especially when it comes to her husband.

291
00:24:14,224 --> 00:24:17,804
I'm not the only one she harassed.

292
00:24:17,804 --> 00:24:23,274
So, has Kim Na Yeong had conflicts with others about her husband?

293
00:24:27,774 --> 00:24:32,404
Something happened between her and Ji Yool's mother.

294
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:34,024
With Yu Jin?

295
00:24:34,024 --> 00:24:37,354
About a week before that happened.

296
00:24:37,354 --> 00:24:43,384
Na Yeong posted something on the apartment complex message board attacking Yu Jin.

297
00:24:43,384 --> 00:24:46,574
It was an emotional post.

298
00:24:47,624 --> 00:24:50,874
I remember she talked about her husband.

299
00:24:52,714 --> 00:24:56,604
"Stop doing filthy things on social media."

300
00:24:56,604 --> 00:25:03,194
"Don't touch my husband. Focus on yours." Something like that.

301
00:25:03,194 --> 00:25:05,324
Is that post still up?

302
00:25:05,324 --> 00:25:07,094
One second.

303
00:25:11,934 --> 00:25:13,174
 Resident Message Board

304
00:25:14,574 --> 00:25:18,314
I thought it was right around here.

305
00:25:18,314 --> 00:25:20,874
She must have deleted it.

306
00:25:25,014 --> 00:25:28,004
 Building 107 meet-up for moms with grade school daughters. See you at 7 pm.

307
00:25:28,004 --> 00:25:29,774
 Golf lovers of Building 104...

308
00:25:29,774 --> 00:25:32,844
 Information about the committee for communal living...

309
00:25:32,844 --> 00:25:34,964
People who live here are interesting.

310
00:25:34,964 --> 00:25:37,664
They have their own world.

311
00:25:41,404 --> 00:25:45,374
But they seem like a strong community, right?

312
00:25:45,374 --> 00:25:46,524
Reserved: Herenity Tea Time, 11 am.

313
00:25:48,514 --> 00:25:51,474
They're well connected to one another,
  Reserved: Mr. Oh's 9 am swimming class students

314
00:25:51,474 --> 00:25:54,444
and believe in the collective.

315
00:26:01,494 --> 00:26:05,794
 Rest in peace, Oh Yu Jin of Building 151, Unit 1004.

316
00:26:05,794 --> 00:26:09,264
 Regarding the attempt to turn an individual death into a communal issue...

317
00:26:09,264 --> 00:26:11,514
 Is this going to affect the buildings' value?

318
00:26:11,514 --> 00:26:14,244
 Our apartment complex security is excellent.

319
00:26:14,244 --> 00:26:17,184
 We need to think about what kind of neighbors we bring in.

320
00:26:17,184 --> 00:26:20,304
 Regarding Unit 1004, where the incident happened.

321
00:26:20,304 --> 00:26:24,884
 If you'll give out resident IDs to anyone, why do we even need them?

322
00:26:24,884 --> 00:26:27,484
 I want to kick them out before they muddy up the water.

323
00:26:27,484 --> 00:26:29,624
 Unit 1835...

324
00:26:33,064 --> 00:26:35,134
Why are you looking at me like that?

325
00:26:35,134 --> 00:26:38,134
How dare you look at an adult like that?

326
00:26:39,824 --> 00:26:41,784
Like mother, like child.

327
00:26:41,784 --> 00:26:43,394
- Please take the kids. 
- Of course.

328
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:44,984
Let's go, Ji Yool, Ha Yool.

329
00:26:44,984 --> 00:26:46,674
You, too.

330
00:26:48,944 --> 00:26:50,174
What did you just say?

331
00:26:50,174 --> 00:26:52,364
What? Did I say something wrong?

332
00:26:52,364 --> 00:26:54,494
How much nastier can you get?

333
00:26:54,494 --> 00:26:58,034
Even if you had issues with Yu Jin, how can you attack her children?

334
00:26:58,034 --> 00:27:01,254
If you're going to go crazy, at least be nice. Are you out of your mind?

335
00:27:01,254 --> 00:27:04,474
What? Crazy?

336
00:27:04,474 --> 00:27:06,414
You're the one running your mouth.

337
00:27:06,414 --> 00:27:09,724
It's your fault that all these rumors are going around here!

338
00:27:09,724 --> 00:27:15,184
Please, can you just see yourself out of this neighborhood? 
 - What?

339
00:27:15,184 --> 00:27:17,914
If you don't leave on your own, you'll get kicked out.

340
00:27:17,914 --> 00:27:20,104
That'll be fun to watch.

341
00:27:20,104 --> 00:27:25,734
And starting tomorrow, Ji Yool and Ha Yool are not welcome at our meetups.

342
00:27:25,734 --> 00:27:28,304
Shut your mouth.

343
00:27:28,304 --> 00:27:32,854
Seriously, are you doing this because you have something to do with Yu Jin's death?

344
00:27:32,854 --> 00:27:35,264
Are you crazy? How dare you accuse me of murder!

345
00:27:35,264 --> 00:27:36,614
I...

346
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:39,214
Mi Ho! Please stop.

347
00:27:39,214 --> 00:27:42,094
Na Yeong, what's wrong with you? You've gone too far.

348
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:43,304
Eonni, stay out of it.

349
00:27:43,304 --> 00:27:45,684
Don't stick your nose in it when you don't know anything.

350
00:27:45,684 --> 00:27:47,254
What do you mean I don't know?

351
00:27:47,254 --> 00:27:48,994
Na Yeong, you're acting strange these days.

352
00:27:48,994 --> 00:27:51,834
We're all mothers. How can you be this way to the children?

353
00:27:51,834 --> 00:27:53,364
- Eonni!
 - She's right.

354
00:27:53,364 --> 00:27:55,894
You're making me uncomfortable.

355
00:27:55,894 --> 00:27:59,204
Let's not exclude or kick out people.

356
00:27:59,204 --> 00:28:02,594
I don't know what's going on but calm yourself down.

357
00:28:02,594 --> 00:28:04,024
Let's go.

358
00:28:04,024 --> 00:28:05,364
Go.

359
00:28:07,204 --> 00:28:09,484
I'm sorry. I'll go ahead.

360
00:28:09,484 --> 00:28:11,634
Ji Yool, Ha Yool, let's go.

361
00:28:11,634 --> 00:28:13,024
Let's go.

362
00:28:27,924 --> 00:28:30,094
Hold on, Ji Yool.

363
00:28:35,334 --> 00:28:36,834
His pupil reflex is normal.

364
00:28:36,834 --> 00:28:40,314
He's stabilized quite a bit, so let's keep watching him.

365
00:28:40,314 --> 00:28:42,184
This is so frustrating.

366
00:28:50,524 --> 00:28:51,894
You're going through a lot, sir.

367
00:28:51,894 --> 00:28:57,144
Don't mention it. You're the ones working hard, Detectives.

368
00:28:57,144 --> 00:29:00,074
How's Kang Do Joon doing?

369
00:29:00,074 --> 00:29:04,244
Well... He's not yet...

370
00:29:12,554 --> 00:29:15,684
- Hello, Ms. Jang Mi Ho. 
- I have no one else to ask.

371
00:29:15,684 --> 00:29:18,074
Got it, got it.

372
00:29:18,074 --> 00:29:20,724
But where are you going without the kids?

373
00:29:23,844 --> 00:29:25,574
I'm going to meet with a detective.

374
00:29:25,574 --> 00:29:29,704
I think I found something, and I want to talk to him.

375
00:29:29,704 --> 00:29:32,454
Why haven't I heard from Mr. Gong?

376
00:29:32,454 --> 00:29:34,864
He said he'll get back to me by today.

377
00:29:34,864 --> 00:29:37,524
I'll give him a call right now.

378
00:29:37,524 --> 00:29:40,964
How long does it take to dig up stuff on one teacher?

379
00:29:41,764 --> 00:29:44,764
If you get any info, report it to me right away.

380
00:29:45,824 --> 00:29:48,234
 Secretary Han Joon Gyeong

381
00:29:51,944 --> 00:29:54,894
 aara_joara

382
00:29:57,424 --> 00:29:59,364
Eonni!

383
00:30:00,694 --> 00:30:03,544
This is not the time to be on your phone.

384
00:30:03,544 --> 00:30:06,224
Do you know what happened while you were gone?

385
00:30:06,224 --> 00:30:08,674
That woman is making me lose my mind.

386
00:30:08,674 --> 00:30:11,814
I have too much going on right now. What is wrong with you?

387
00:30:11,814 --> 00:30:14,264
Did you stir up that woman Jang Mi Ho again?

388
00:30:14,264 --> 00:30:16,334
You think you can just do whatever you want?

389
00:30:16,334 --> 00:30:19,544
I told you not to stir things up. Why don't you listen?

390
00:30:19,544 --> 00:30:21,844
I'm going to kick her out of here.

391
00:30:21,844 --> 00:30:23,414
So Eonni, you step up.

392
00:30:23,414 --> 00:30:25,324
Are you crazy? Why would I do that?

393
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,684
Because she's going around digging!

394
00:30:27,684 --> 00:30:30,974
Why? Do you have a secret you don't want her to dig up?

395
00:30:30,974 --> 00:30:33,704
Like how your husband cheats on you?

396
00:30:34,844 --> 00:30:37,334
Do you think we don't know?

397
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,694
- We?
 - Yes, we.

398
00:30:42,694 --> 00:30:44,934
 Who's going to get the bill today?

399
00:30:44,934 --> 00:30:46,094
 Husband?

400
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,914
 What did he say?

401
00:30:48,844 --> 00:30:51,534
 We spend money on what we love, don't we?

402
00:30:51,534 --> 00:30:54,644
 Lunch is on me today.

403
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:57,124
I don't know who he's seeing these days,

404
00:30:57,124 --> 00:31:01,354
but I've seen him drive around another woman more than once or twice.

405
00:31:01,354 --> 00:31:03,674
So please just calm down.

406
00:31:03,674 --> 00:31:06,174
How would Jang Mi Ho know that?`

407
00:31:06,174 --> 00:31:09,514
Go cosplay as a happy couple on social media like you used to.

408
00:31:09,514 --> 00:31:12,204
We're all commenting to improve your image.

409
00:31:13,224 --> 00:31:18,294
How... how can you deceive me like this?

410
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:21,364
You knew everything. How could you? You knew everything!

411
00:31:21,364 --> 00:31:22,994
Should we have shown it, then?

412
00:31:22,994 --> 00:31:25,084
You just want to cover it up.

413
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:28,864
Wasn't it enough to just look like a happy couple to others?

414
00:31:28,864 --> 00:31:31,194
Why are you acting up now?

415
00:31:32,554 --> 00:31:34,684
I'm not letting this go.

416
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:39,184
Even if it's you, I won't let this go.

417
00:31:39,184 --> 00:31:41,324
Who do you think you are?

418
00:31:41,324 --> 00:31:42,634
Are you threatening me?

419
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:44,554
Yes, I'm threatening you!

420
00:31:44,554 --> 00:31:47,274
You think I don't have cards to play?

421
00:31:47,274 --> 00:31:51,794
Eonni, aren't you looking for Oh Yu Jin's flash drive?

422
00:31:54,044 --> 00:31:56,434
Did you think I didn't know?

423
00:31:56,434 --> 00:31:58,384
Oh Yu Jin had your secrets in her hands.

424
00:31:58,384 --> 00:32:02,154
I'll tell Jang Mi Ho everything if things go wrong.

425
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:03,444
And also...

426
00:32:04,434 --> 00:32:08,794
what we did before Oh Yu Jin died.

427
00:32:10,234 --> 00:32:11,954
What?

428
00:32:11,954 --> 00:32:13,974
Hey, Kim Na Yeong.

429
00:32:15,354 --> 00:32:18,674
Since it's come to this, let's just all die together.

430
00:32:18,674 --> 00:32:23,754
I know how important your investor presentation is to you.

431
00:32:23,754 --> 00:32:27,384
If you don't want to roll in mud before that comes up,

432
00:32:27,384 --> 00:32:29,584
you better listen to me.

433
00:33:00,554 --> 00:33:02,804
 Where are you, Ms. Hwang-

434
00:33:15,544 --> 00:33:20,644
I realized what I gave you last time wasn't enough for growing kids.

435
00:33:20,644 --> 00:33:23,074
We still have so much left.

436
00:33:23,074 --> 00:33:26,284
Kids will eat this up in no time.

437
00:33:27,324 --> 00:33:29,254
Thank you.

438
00:33:33,784 --> 00:33:36,794
- Could I use your bathroom? 
- Sure.

439
00:34:21,144 --> 00:34:24,674
Where did she hide that little thing?

440
00:35:15,814 --> 00:35:19,204
Are you looking for something in this room? 
 - What?

441
00:35:19,204 --> 00:35:22,524
Why do you keep coming into someone else's office?

442
00:35:24,394 --> 00:35:27,384
Why are you treating me like some kind of thief?

443
00:35:27,384 --> 00:35:31,374
I was considerate enough to bring food for your kids. This is rude.

444
00:35:35,244 --> 00:35:37,734
Auntie, someone's here.

445
00:35:37,734 --> 00:35:39,414
Okay.

446
00:36:01,894 --> 00:36:05,654
I'm so sorry, I got stuck in traffic.

447
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:11,104
Hello.

448
00:36:12,394 --> 00:36:15,244
You two seem pretty close.

449
00:36:16,094 --> 00:36:19,004
- Yes. 
- I'm heading out.

450
00:36:20,634 --> 00:36:22,334
Take care.

451
00:36:28,234 --> 00:36:30,134
Gosh, damn it!

452
00:36:34,834 --> 00:36:36,974
 I'm getting a beer with Seong Hui. Want to come?

453
00:36:36,974 --> 00:36:38,594
 I want to talk to you.

454
00:36:38,594 --> 00:36:40,574
 So Min

455
00:36:40,574 --> 00:36:43,664
Hey, So Min, of all times, why now?

456
00:36:43,664 --> 00:36:45,974
What's going on?

457
00:36:45,974 --> 00:36:48,064
Na Yeong?

458
00:36:48,064 --> 00:36:50,794
What happened exactly?

459
00:36:50,794 --> 00:36:51,944
Yeah.

460
00:36:52,734 --> 00:36:55,304
She's probably gone.

461
00:36:55,304 --> 00:36:56,874
You should go.

462
00:36:56,874 --> 00:36:59,454
You have to come back before they go to bed, right?

463
00:37:03,904 --> 00:37:06,264
Thank you so much.

464
00:37:10,624 --> 00:37:12,904
Oh, wait, the photos.

465
00:37:25,174 --> 00:37:27,604
What are you doing?

466
00:37:31,574 --> 00:37:34,204
Why is this room locked?

467
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:39,534
Why are you asking me that?

468
00:37:39,534 --> 00:37:43,054
Just because. The door is locked.

469
00:37:43,054 --> 00:37:44,674
Did you forget something?

470
00:37:44,674 --> 00:37:46,404
Hurry. Go.

471
00:37:56,374 --> 00:38:00,374
 Ms. Jang, if you read my text, at least send me a "yeah."

472
00:38:00,374 --> 00:38:03,144
 Or just a period.

473
00:38:03,144 --> 00:38:04,354
What are you doing?

474
00:38:04,354 --> 00:38:06,404
How come your butt is still on that chair?

475
00:38:06,404 --> 00:38:08,964
I have a little more work to do.

476
00:38:08,964 --> 00:38:10,784
Why so motivated all of a sudden?

477
00:38:10,784 --> 00:38:12,844
You were whining like an abandoned dog.

478
00:38:12,844 --> 00:38:14,274
When did I do that?

479
00:38:14,274 --> 00:38:15,654
Hurry up and head out.

480
00:38:15,654 --> 00:38:18,824
I don't need another live-in employee besides Jang Mi Ho.

481
00:38:18,824 --> 00:38:20,864
Yes, sir. Go on ahead.

482
00:38:20,864 --> 00:38:22,684
All right.

483
00:38:32,724 --> 00:38:34,114
 ooo_yoojin

484
00:38:35,934 --> 00:38:37,514
My goodness...

485
00:38:37,514 --> 00:38:39,874
For someone like her...

486
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:50,864
What is this?

487
00:38:51,864 --> 00:38:54,184
- This is...
 - An affair?

488
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:59,354
You know the details of the investigation are private.

489
00:38:59,354 --> 00:39:03,754
It's a murder case. No one is cleared from being a suspect.

490
00:39:03,754 --> 00:39:05,634
I found this in Yu Jin's home.

491
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:08,674
This is a bracelet she wore often.

492
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:16,284
This man and Oh Yu Jin were having an affair?

493
00:39:16,284 --> 00:39:19,734
I can't say for certain, but I couldn't just ignore it.

494
00:39:19,734 --> 00:39:22,274
Sure. I know what you mean.

495
00:39:22,274 --> 00:39:24,524
If we find anything, I'll call you.

496
00:39:24,524 --> 00:39:26,074
Are you going to look into it?

497
00:39:26,074 --> 00:39:28,284
If we need to, we will.

498
00:39:31,154 --> 00:39:33,014
Get home safely.

499
00:39:33,014 --> 00:39:35,144
Yeah. Where are you?

500
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:33,244
Hey! Hold on! Stop!

501
00:40:45,714 --> 00:40:48,614
 Cheers!

502
00:40:49,964 --> 00:40:53,174
What do you guys think about sending the kids to ski camp in Switzerland?

503
00:40:53,174 --> 00:40:55,344
- Great idea!
 - Sounds amazing, right?

504
00:40:55,344 --> 00:40:57,244
That'd be great if kids ski and...

505
00:40:59,264 --> 00:41:00,914
Seriously?

506
00:41:03,574 --> 00:41:05,314
Geez!

507
00:41:13,014 --> 00:41:16,334
It's so hard to talk to him...

508
00:41:26,024 --> 00:41:30,594
You could have sent me one reply, you know.

509
00:41:30,594 --> 00:41:32,614
Sorry, I've been busy.

510
00:41:32,614 --> 00:41:34,494
- What's going on?
  - So, Oh Yu Jin...

511
00:41:34,494 --> 00:41:37,424
 You know how she posted everything on social media?

512
00:41:37,424 --> 00:41:39,554
 I'm looking through it, and something's bugging me.

513
00:41:39,554 --> 00:41:41,704
I told you to stop caring. If that's it, I'm hanging up.

514
00:41:41,704 --> 00:41:44,434
Hold on! This is really weird.

515
00:41:44,434 --> 00:41:49,644
Oh Yu Jin's social media is mostly selfies and her family.

516
00:41:49,644 --> 00:41:52,064
There's just one photo that's not.

517
00:41:52,064 --> 00:41:54,514
It's a photo of a kindergarten talent show.

518
00:41:54,514 --> 00:41:57,274
It's a photo of Kim Na Yeong's family.

519
00:41:57,274 --> 00:41:59,124
When did you find out her name?

520
00:41:59,124 --> 00:42:01,554
 I looked into it a bit.

521
00:42:01,554 --> 00:42:03,634
 Anyway, the fact that Oh Yu Jin posted someone else's photo,

522
00:42:03,634 --> 00:42:10,254
 a family photo of the man she cheated with doesn't make sense.

523
00:42:11,244 --> 00:42:14,124
 If it was an affair, shouldn't she have been more careful?

524
00:42:23,024 --> 00:42:25,224
Plus, the hashtags just repeat the caption.

525
00:42:25,224 --> 00:42:30,094
 Eyes gazing with love. #Eyes #Gazing #Love

526
00:42:30,094 --> 00:42:33,394
Saying "Eyes gazing with love" about your daughter?

527
00:42:33,394 --> 00:42:35,244
 #Eyes #Gazing #Love

528
00:42:46,334 --> 00:42:51,194
 Eyes gazing with love...

529
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:54,584
The eyes gazing...

530
00:42:58,094 --> 00:42:59,854
with love?

531
00:43:15,784 --> 00:43:17,184
Ms. Jang!

532
00:43:50,514 --> 00:43:52,354
Are you sure they're done at 9?

533
00:43:52,354 --> 00:43:53,684
Yes.

534
00:43:56,614 --> 00:43:58,684
I have a headache.

535
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:32,744
 OB-GYN

536
00:44:32,744 --> 00:44:34,604
Gynecologist?

537
00:44:34,604 --> 00:44:37,394
And the man is Lee Tae Ho, for sure?

538
00:44:39,804 --> 00:44:44,344
Great. Give Mr. Gong what we promised and then some.

539
00:45:32,394 --> 00:45:34,224
I was wondering if you were okay.

540
00:45:34,224 --> 00:45:36,384
Why did you come?

541
00:45:38,774 --> 00:45:40,824
I don't know, either.

542
00:45:40,824 --> 00:45:43,424
Before I knew it, I found myself riding the bus.

543
00:45:48,604 --> 00:45:53,804
So Oh Yu Jin and Kim Na Yeong's husband. They weren't together, right?

544
00:45:53,804 --> 00:45:55,454
Right.

545
00:45:56,424 --> 00:46:01,044
But I still think Kim Na Yeong has something against Oh Yu Jin.

546
00:46:01,044 --> 00:46:03,824
I mean, she mocked her so much on social media.

547
00:46:03,824 --> 00:46:06,244
Maybe she hated her enough to kill her.

548
00:46:11,134 --> 00:46:12,284
Wh-Wh-Why?

549
00:46:12,284 --> 00:46:14,834
Usually, that's not enough to kill someone.

550
00:46:14,834 --> 00:46:19,774
You're just deciding Kim Na Yeong did it and looking for a reason.

551
00:46:19,774 --> 00:46:21,734
No, I'm not.

552
00:46:21,734 --> 00:46:23,724
I feel like I have a point.

553
00:46:23,724 --> 00:46:27,194
It's fine. I want to stop now.

554
00:46:27,194 --> 00:46:29,754
I think I was just out of my mind.

555
00:46:30,654 --> 00:46:31,904
Will you be okay, though?

556
00:46:31,904 --> 00:46:34,574
If I wasn't okay, what difference does it make?

557
00:46:34,574 --> 00:46:37,614
There's nothing I can do.

558
00:46:53,594 --> 00:46:56,784
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to...

559
00:46:59,994 --> 00:47:01,834
 The man who can't live without me ♥ (25 calls)

560
00:47:20,964 --> 00:47:22,814
 The call is not going through...

561
00:47:30,074 --> 00:47:31,444
Where are you going at this hour?

562
00:47:31,444 --> 00:47:34,534
What do you care? Just go.

563
00:47:36,514 --> 00:47:39,084
If it's not urgent, do you want to talk for a second?

564
00:47:39,084 --> 00:47:40,464
You guys can go.

565
00:47:40,464 --> 00:47:42,604
Don't fight, you two.

566
00:47:42,604 --> 00:47:44,444
Bye, Eonni.

567
00:47:46,084 --> 00:47:47,524
I don't have anything to say to you.

568
00:47:47,524 --> 00:47:50,704
You're looking for your husband, right?

569
00:47:50,704 --> 00:47:52,934
Do you even know where he is?

570
00:47:54,354 --> 00:47:56,814
If you want to know, follow me.

571
00:48:08,564 --> 00:48:10,824
What are you going to do here?

572
00:48:10,824 --> 00:48:15,744
I don't think you have it in you to threaten me, so I'm letting you know.

573
00:48:15,744 --> 00:48:17,554
That's why you dragged me here?

574
00:48:17,554 --> 00:48:20,914
Your husband is having an affair with Jo Ah Ra.

575
00:48:20,914 --> 00:48:23,404
Oh Yu Jin knew, too.

576
00:48:23,404 --> 00:48:25,704
Is that why you pulled out that tree? How immature.

577
00:48:25,704 --> 00:48:28,224
No, I just got rid of the sign-

578
00:48:28,224 --> 00:48:31,034
Because Jo Ah Ra wrote it?

579
00:48:31,034 --> 00:48:35,894
I mean, it's really something, having an affair with an assistant teacher.

580
00:48:35,894 --> 00:48:39,414
I know you're not in your right mind these days, but

581
00:48:39,414 --> 00:48:43,134
you still shouldn't threaten me.

582
00:48:44,134 --> 00:48:45,854
Eonni, how can you do this to me?

583
00:48:45,854 --> 00:48:49,964
What's wrong? You started this.

584
00:48:51,724 --> 00:48:55,434
I don't think you should relax, either, Eonni.

585
00:48:55,434 --> 00:48:58,024
Jang Mi Ho has been digging everywhere.

586
00:48:58,024 --> 00:48:59,944
You don't think she knows about the flash drive?

587
00:48:59,944 --> 00:49:02,034
And the fact that you're looking for it?

588
00:49:03,484 --> 00:49:05,264
So what?

589
00:49:05,264 --> 00:49:07,474
What if she opens up the flash drive?

590
00:49:07,474 --> 00:49:09,534
Do you think I'm stupid?

591
00:49:09,534 --> 00:49:12,994
Oh Yu Jin was grinding her teeth, digging up dirt on us.

592
00:49:12,994 --> 00:49:17,574
Do you think I have no idea what your secret is?

593
00:49:19,954 --> 00:49:21,734
Don't be ridiculous.

594
00:49:21,734 --> 00:49:24,204
How are you going to make up something that doesn't exist?

595
00:49:24,204 --> 00:49:26,774
Your company will be sued for plagiarism.

596
00:49:28,744 --> 00:49:32,344
Since two years ago, everything you've launched has flopped.

597
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:35,854
When Jang Mi Ho sees what's in the flash drive, she's not going to keep quiet.

598
00:49:35,854 --> 00:49:40,274
Fine. I'd be humiliated if my secrets were out, but it doesn't matter.

599
00:49:40,274 --> 00:49:43,094
But you'll be in a tough spot, won't you?

600
00:49:43,094 --> 00:49:45,894
You have that investor presentation coming up.

601
00:49:51,774 --> 00:49:54,244
Want to know something?

602
00:49:54,244 --> 00:49:56,544
Jo Ah Ra is pregnant.

603
00:50:01,204 --> 00:50:02,314
Stop lying.

604
00:50:02,314 --> 00:50:06,294
And you think you can tell me what to do?

605
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:08,964
Worry about yourself.

606
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:11,564
Your life is on the edge of a cliff.

607
00:50:17,934 --> 00:50:20,474
You used to brag constantly about your husband.

608
00:50:20,474 --> 00:50:22,904
Look at you now.

609
00:50:22,904 --> 00:50:25,034
What a sight.

610
00:50:51,424 --> 00:50:53,784
Are you crazy?

611
00:50:53,784 --> 00:50:57,144
Where did you go, leaving a sleeping kid alone?

612
00:50:57,144 --> 00:50:59,934
You don't want to be a mother anymore?

613
00:50:59,934 --> 00:51:01,944
What is wrong with you?

614
00:51:01,944 --> 00:51:04,514
Why do you make my life so difficult?

615
00:51:09,114 --> 00:51:12,724
Let me live, Na Yeong. Please?

616
00:51:12,724 --> 00:51:16,084
You make my blood run dry every single day.

617
00:51:54,264 --> 00:51:55,394
Bye!

618
00:51:55,394 --> 00:51:57,344
Bye. Thank you.

619
00:51:57,344 --> 00:52:00,534
- Good morning!
 - Good morning, Do Hui!

620
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:02,884
Good morning!

621
00:52:07,984 --> 00:52:09,784
Where are you going?

622
00:52:09,784 --> 00:52:12,874
It's brunch day. Aren't you coming?

623
00:52:16,554 --> 00:52:18,984
What are you so scared of?

624
00:52:18,984 --> 00:52:20,974
Are you running away?

625
00:52:24,254 --> 00:52:25,804
Let's go.

626
00:52:29,664 --> 00:52:32,214
Mi Ho, come with us. You should make up, too.

627
00:52:33,134 --> 00:52:35,434
Sure. Let's go.

628
00:52:44,484 --> 00:52:46,254
Should we get going?

629
00:52:46,254 --> 00:52:48,334
We need to pay.

630
00:52:55,814 --> 00:52:58,504
Mi Ho, you can eat for free.

631
00:52:58,504 --> 00:53:00,444
How about husbands, again?

632
00:53:00,444 --> 00:53:02,084
Good idea!

633
00:53:02,084 --> 00:53:03,534
Good idea.

634
00:53:03,534 --> 00:53:05,994
Men are so easy.

635
00:53:06,854 --> 00:53:09,234
Message...

636
00:53:09,234 --> 00:53:12,994
"Honey, let's have another baby."

637
00:53:12,994 --> 00:53:14,334
Seriously?

638
00:53:15,154 --> 00:53:17,044
Aren't we making it too obvious?

639
00:53:17,044 --> 00:53:20,704
Some husbands will start guessing the right answer.

640
00:53:20,704 --> 00:53:23,674
So Min, it's your third baby.

641
00:53:29,854 --> 00:53:31,734
So Min can pass.

642
00:53:31,734 --> 00:53:36,544
 Honey, let's have another baby

643
00:53:38,504 --> 00:53:40,484
Why aren't you sending it?

644
00:53:59,994 --> 00:54:04,464
 Honey...

645
00:54:09,374 --> 00:54:10,754
 Honey, let's have another baby

646
00:54:27,474 --> 00:54:31,894
-To have three kids, you have twins. Then, you'll have three kids. 
 - Must be nice.

647
00:54:40,054 --> 00:54:41,644
Excuse me.

648
00:54:55,684 --> 00:54:57,334
You're home.

649
00:55:20,354 --> 00:55:22,214
 New post from spirit_ssong

650
00:55:29,074 --> 00:55:31,844
 Ms. Jo Ah Ra, our lovely and kind teacher.

651
00:55:31,844 --> 00:55:34,414
 We hope she'll be around for a long time.

652
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:36,284
 She looks just like Ah Rin.

653
00:55:36,284 --> 00:55:38,034
 She could be mistaken for her stepmom.

654
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:40,564
 - She really does look like Ah Ra!
 - They do look alike!

655
00:55:40,564 --> 00:55:42,884
 If you didn't know, you'd think they're mom and daughter.

656
00:55:42,884 --> 00:55:45,524
 Both are so pretty.

657
00:56:03,424 --> 00:56:04,614
 Healthy Porridge

658
00:56:12,554 --> 00:56:16,224
Gosh, this is bugging me like crazy.

659
00:57:09,234 --> 00:57:12,954
Hello, I'm here to see Kim Na Yeong.

660
00:57:12,954 --> 00:57:14,704
She seemed a little sick.

661
00:57:14,704 --> 00:57:17,394
Oh. Yes, come on in.

662
00:57:34,164 --> 00:57:36,794
Ma'am, someone's here for you.

663
00:57:45,644 --> 00:57:47,204
Have a seat on the couch.

664
00:57:47,204 --> 00:57:48,784
Sure.

665
00:58:08,634 --> 00:58:11,664
 Please... save me.

666
00:58:13,324 --> 00:58:14,514
 She's in danger.

667
00:58:14,514 --> 00:58:15,564
 Does anyone know her?

668
00:58:15,564 --> 00:58:17,894
 Somebody get her right now.

669
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:25,970

670
00:58:26,784 --> 00:58:32,674
♫  A page tainted with lies  ♫

671
00:58:32,674 --> 00:58:38,314
♫  Truth doesn't exist there  ♫

672
00:58:38,314 --> 00:58:45,634
♫  Every moment is growing faint  ♫

673
00:58:45,634 --> 00:58:51,514
♫  A game full of confusion  ♫

674
00:58:51,514 --> 00:58:57,454
♫  Something's wrong, open my closed eyes  ♫

675
00:58:57,454 --> 00:58:59,304
♫  It's over  ♫

676
00:58:59,304 --> 00:59:02,574
 Battle of Happiness

677
00:59:02,574 --> 00:59:05,344
 What? Is she really guilty or something?

678
00:59:05,344 --> 00:59:07,554
 - Why did you do that?
 - Pardon?

679
00:59:07,554 --> 00:59:09,274
 This whole situation is your fault!

680
00:59:09,274 --> 00:59:13,154
 We can't just ignore the Na Yeong issue.

681
00:59:15,764 --> 00:59:18,304
 There's a woman called Assistant Manager Jang Mi Ho.

682
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:21,414
 Dig up dirt on her. About her past.

683
00:59:21,414 --> 00:59:24,664
♫  Never again, never leave behind  ♫

684
00:59:24,664 --> 00:59:27,904
 How could you not tell me something so important!

685
00:59:27,904 --> 00:59:31,488
♫  Wake up, wake up your desire  ♫
