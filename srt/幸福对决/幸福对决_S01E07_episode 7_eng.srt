 Battle For Happiness

10
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,520
 This is a work of fiction. Characters, locales, agencies, incidents, organizations, and jobs have no connections to real life.

11
00:00:49,294 --> 00:00:50,794

I'm not letting this go.

12
00:00:50,794 --> 00:00:52,704
 Oh Yu Jin had your secrets in her hands.

13
00:00:52,704 --> 00:00:56,644
 I'll tell Jang Mi Ho everything if things go wrong.

14
00:00:56,644 --> 00:00:59,074
 And what we did before Oh Yu Jin died.

15
00:00:59,074 --> 00:01:01,274
 You better listen to me.

16
00:01:02,404 --> 00:01:04,134
 How about husbands, again?

17
00:01:04,134 --> 00:01:07,594
 "Honey, let's have another baby."

18
00:01:16,594 --> 00:01:18,054
 What did she say? Why did she do it?

19
00:01:18,054 --> 00:01:20,294
 She told me to stop asking her such questions.

20
00:01:20,294 --> 00:01:21,544
 Maybe there's something there.

21
00:01:21,544 --> 00:01:23,584
 Why was she even there?

22
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:26,194
 Why do you keep coming into someone else's office?

23
00:01:26,194 --> 00:01:29,604
 Why are you treating me like some kind of thief?

24
00:01:29,604 --> 00:01:31,464
 You want to totally exclude Jang Mi Ho?

25
00:01:31,464 --> 00:01:34,054
 How can we let the perpetrator and the victim be in one group chat?

26
00:01:34,054 --> 00:01:36,574
 There's a person called Chief Jang Mi Ho. Can you dig into her background?

27
00:01:36,574 --> 00:01:40,994
 I think we'll be using those accounts.

28
00:01:55,134 --> 00:01:56,614
 Let's trade.

29
00:01:56,614 --> 00:01:58,744
 I'll give you what you want.

00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:02,314
 At 11 pm, underground parking level 3, area A.

31
00:02:02,314 --> 00:02:06,824
 Don't forget the USB.

32
00:02:12,884 --> 00:02:17,714
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep...

33
00:02:18,544 --> 00:02:20,904
 Underground parking level 3, area A.

34
00:02:20,904 --> 00:02:23,014
 USB?

35
00:02:35,314 --> 00:02:38,884

36
00:02:43,094 --> 00:02:45,604
How come you're outside?

37
00:02:45,604 --> 00:02:48,644
- Mommy!
 - Ah Rin!

38
00:02:52,234 --> 00:02:55,404
- Ms. Jo, could you please help her? 
- Okay.

39
00:02:55,404 --> 00:02:57,714
Gosh, look at your complexion.

40
00:02:57,714 --> 00:02:59,514
You must not be feeling well at all.

41
00:02:59,514 --> 00:03:01,834
Let's go to the hospital room quickly.

42
00:03:23,744 --> 00:03:25,944
We were so worried about you!

43
00:03:25,944 --> 00:03:28,724
How did you even fall in the bathroom?

44
00:03:28,724 --> 00:03:31,814
Y-You know how wet bathroom floors can be really dangerous...

45
00:03:31,814 --> 00:03:33,954
I'm glad your injuries aren't worse.

46
00:03:33,954 --> 00:03:35,724
I was careless.

47
00:03:35,724 --> 00:03:39,284
It seems I bothered the people around me for nothing.

48
00:03:39,284 --> 00:03:40,694
You were lucky.

49
00:03:40,694 --> 00:03:43,114
We thought you were hurt pretty badly.

50
00:03:46,144 --> 00:03:49,014
By the way, it's really nice here.

51
00:03:49,014 --> 00:03:51,584
I wonder how much it costs?

52
00:03:51,584 --> 00:03:54,714
Why wonder about something you'll never get to find out?

53
00:03:55,624 --> 00:03:57,144
Excuse me?

54
00:03:57,144 --> 00:03:58,774
If you want to find out how much it costs,

55
00:03:58,774 --> 00:04:02,584
why don't you get hurt badly and get admitted to the hospital?

56
00:04:04,654 --> 00:04:07,844
My gosh, how could you say something like that?

57
00:04:07,844 --> 00:04:10,844
Na Yeong must be on edge because she's not feeling well.

58
00:04:10,844 --> 00:04:14,404
Mom, look at me!

59
00:04:14,404 --> 00:04:18,444
Ah Rin, let's go play over there so the adults can talk.

60
00:04:24,634 --> 00:04:25,954
Ta-da!

61
00:04:27,154 --> 00:04:31,554
Ms. Jo takes especially good care of Ah Rin.

62
00:04:31,554 --> 00:04:33,694
This is all your blessings.

63
00:04:33,694 --> 00:04:37,274
How nice is it to have someone help you like this when things are hard?

64
00:04:37,274 --> 00:04:39,414
I guess so.

65
00:04:39,414 --> 00:04:43,124
Really. What a blessed life I have.

66
00:04:46,004 --> 00:04:47,754
Oh, you got something on your face.

67
00:04:50,904 --> 00:04:53,494
How dare you touch her with your dirty hand!

68
00:05:00,954 --> 00:05:02,784
Get out.

69
00:05:02,784 --> 00:05:05,524
I said get out of here immediately!

70
00:05:21,434 --> 00:05:24,324
What USB are they talking about?

71
00:05:27,714 --> 00:05:29,184
 VIP Ward 91

72
00:05:35,064 --> 00:05:37,794
- Are you all right?
 - Yes.

73
00:05:37,794 --> 00:05:41,274
Ah Rin's mother seems to be suffering more from personal issues.

74
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,424
You poor thing.

75
00:06:12,574 --> 00:06:13,964
 The man who can't live without me ♥

76
00:06:15,604 --> 00:06:18,084
 - Honey, let's make another baby.
- I'll be late tonight. Go ahead and eat with Ah Rin./

77
00:06:21,834 --> 00:06:23,794
 The woman who can't live without me ♥

78
00:06:32,564 --> 00:06:36,024
- Yes.
 - Remember when I sent you a text before?

79
00:06:36,024 --> 00:06:37,564
About having a second child.

80
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,634
What do you think? Shall we really have one?

81
00:06:39,634 --> 00:06:40,944
What are you talking about?

82
00:06:40,944 --> 00:06:42,514
 Let's have one!

83
00:06:42,514 --> 00:06:45,654
You want one too, right? A second baby.

84
00:06:53,384 --> 00:06:56,704
I told you. There's no second one for us.

85
00:07:00,344 --> 00:07:01,214
Really?

86
00:07:01,214 --> 00:07:04,674
 Want to know something? Jo Ah Ra is pregnant.

87
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:08,544
- We really won't have a second?
  - No, we won't.

88
00:07:08,544 --> 00:07:11,244
 Don't think nonsense and get some rest.

89
00:07:22,854 --> 00:07:26,454
I took care of the big items, so you just need to follow through with these.

90
00:07:26,454 --> 00:07:29,554
Mr. Park will take care of the practical matters.

91
00:07:30,524 --> 00:07:33,644
For now, I'll focus on Herinity Night.

92
00:07:33,644 --> 00:07:36,644
There are so many things I need to take care of.

93
00:07:36,644 --> 00:07:38,084
Honey.

94
00:07:39,464 --> 00:07:41,854
What now? You can't take care of that alone?

95
00:07:41,854 --> 00:07:44,054
O-Oh, it's not that.

96
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:48,494
 Eonni, I went to visit Na Yeong at the hospital.

97
00:07:49,404 --> 00:07:51,654
Then, what? Why?

98
00:07:51,654 --> 00:07:53,844
No, it's nothing. Just telling you to get home safely.

99
00:07:53,844 --> 00:07:56,374
Tell me if it gets really difficult, though.

100
00:08:05,564 --> 00:08:08,034
 Hyeong, why aren't you responding?

101
00:08:08,034 --> 00:08:10,464
When are you going to pay me back?

102
00:08:11,374 --> 00:08:13,774
 Na Yeong, how are you feeling?

103
00:08:13,774 --> 00:08:15,754
 I was worried about you.

104
00:08:15,754 --> 00:08:20,074
 I think I was worked up at the time...

105
00:08:20,074 --> 00:08:25,324
 Since we were both at fault, let's just forget about the whole thing.

106
00:08:53,194 --> 00:08:55,114
Oh, that's right!

Girls, let's go to bed early tonight. Quickly.

112
00:09:38,424 --> 00:09:40,384
- I don't want to. 
- No!

113
00:09:40,384 --> 00:09:41,854
Hurry up.

114

I'm sorry.

Hold on!

 CEO Song Jeong Ah

129
00:14:34,504 --> 00:14:36,224
Oh, yeah?

130
00:14:36,224 --> 00:14:37,784
Interesting...

131
00:14:37,784 --> 00:14:39,814
Oh, that place? Sounds good.

132
00:14:39,814 --> 00:14:43,194
- It's really good. 
- Let's go there, then.

133
00:14:43,714 --> 00:14:44,964
Let's go.

134
00:14:44,964 --> 00:14:46,564
Okay.

135
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,464
Oh, shoot.

136
00:14:54,674 --> 00:14:57,544
Hey, my cell phone.

137
00:14:57,544 --> 00:15:00,274
- What?
 - I said bring it.

138
00:15:02,754 --> 00:15:04,604
I won't walk you out. Get home safely.

139
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:06,554
Thank you. Brother-in-law, I'll get going.

140
00:15:06,554 --> 00:15:08,214
Thank you for today.

141
00:15:08,214 --> 00:15:09,534
- Noona, see you!
 - Bye.

142
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,264
Brother-in-law, see you again!

143
00:15:15,184 --> 00:15:16,474
 Selfies at kids' cafe.

144
00:15:16,474 --> 00:15:18,934
 Another day of flexing.

146
00:15:22,784 --> 00:15:24,834
 A selfie from my home, too.

147
00:15:24,834 --> 00:15:27,044
 Testing out the new lipstick from Inner Spirit.

148
00:15:27,044 --> 00:15:28,624
 They're all so great.

149
00:15:28,624 --> 00:15:31,424
 Out of these, the CEO's choice is this color.

150
00:15:31,424 --> 00:15:34,274
 Love My Lips. Trying it out before the launch.

151
00:15:34,274 --> 00:15:35,814
 The CEO's choice.

152
00:15:35,814 --> 00:15:37,824
 Oh, my gosh. Eonni! It's too pretty, isn't it?

153
00:15:37,824 --> 00:15:39,914
 - When is the launch?
 - I want it so badly!

154
00:15:39,914 --> 00:15:41,734
 - When can we buy them?
 - I'd like 10 right now.

155
00:15:41,734 --> 00:15:43,804
 - I can't wait!
 - We got a preview!

156
00:15:43,804 --> 00:15:47,274
 - Waiting for the release! 
- Of course, Inner Spirit is the best!

157
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,911
Where did it go?

158
00:15:57,911 --> 00:16:00,061
Why didn't you wash my teddy's clothes?

159
00:16:00,061 --> 00:16:01,991
I told you yesterday!

160
00:16:01,991 --> 00:16:05,391
All right. I'll wash it today. Good, right?

161
00:16:05,391 --> 00:16:07,531
You too, Ha Yool! Let's get going!

162
00:16:09,131 --> 00:16:11,131
What are you looking for?

163
00:16:11,131 --> 00:16:12,821
I found it!

164
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:17,291
No, you have to leave that here.

165
00:16:18,781 --> 00:16:20,841
Hurry up.

166
00:16:20,841 --> 00:16:22,681
Ji Yool, let's go.

167
00:16:27,311 --> 00:16:29,691
Oh, wait. Wait a minute.

168
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:35,481
Good morning!

169
00:16:39,021 --> 00:16:40,271
Hey, we should go, too!

170
00:16:40,271 --> 00:16:42,151
I even delayed going to work because of this.

171
00:16:42,151 --> 00:16:43,611
Where?

172
00:16:43,611 --> 00:16:47,691
What? You didn't know there's a preparatory meeting for Herinity's Night today?

173
00:16:47,691 --> 00:16:49,491
What's that?

174
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,781
It's supposed to be a parent's education group.

175
00:16:52,781 --> 00:16:55,651
But actually, it's a kind of social club.

176
00:16:55,651 --> 00:17:00,361
As long as Song Jeong Ah is in charge of the committee, the moms won't have it easy.

177
00:17:00,361 --> 00:17:01,551
Let's go.

178
00:17:01,551 --> 00:17:03,081
Let's go.

179
00:17:17,191 --> 00:17:18,511
 The 9th Herinity's Night Preparatory Committee Meeting

180
00:17:18,511 --> 00:17:19,851
Let's go in.

181
00:17:36,441 --> 00:17:38,831
What brings you here, Ms. Jang?

182
00:17:38,831 --> 00:17:41,031
I came here as the children's parent.

183
00:17:41,031 --> 00:17:44,381
Why bother attending when you'll be leaving this neighborhood soon?

184
00:17:44,381 --> 00:17:47,761
People who lack community spirit are unwelcome here.

185
00:17:47,761 --> 00:17:51,171
I'm going to do my best while I'm here.

186
00:17:54,631 --> 00:17:57,511
Since we're all here, shall we start?

187
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:03,011
As discussed before, the drinking water can be ordered through the brochure.

188
00:18:03,011 --> 00:18:07,681
Could So Min and Seong Hui confirm each person's participation? Be sure to check with them.

189
00:18:07,681 --> 00:18:09,641
- Yes. 
- Yes.

190
00:18:18,441 --> 00:18:21,071
 It seemed like she was looking for something in the office.

191
00:18:21,071 --> 00:18:22,521
 And it happened twice.

192
00:18:22,521 --> 00:18:24,671
 Ms. Song Jeong Ah!

193
00:18:26,971 --> 00:18:29,291
 I was looking for the girls' hairband...

194
00:18:47,851 --> 00:18:50,881
I thought number 7, J Royal Cooking, looked good.

195
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:53,141
Not only is their plating high-end,

196
00:18:53,141 --> 00:18:55,221
they even have a self-refrigerated vehicle.

197
00:18:55,221 --> 00:18:58,391
I like this place best. What does everyone think?

198
00:18:58,391 --> 00:19:00,481
 Eonni, it's your choice. No need to ask us.

199
00:19:00,481 --> 00:19:02,341
Of course, we agree with you!

200
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:05,411
Then let's decide on this caterer.

201
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:09,391
As for the thank you gift wrapping design, could you do it, So Min?

202
00:19:09,391 --> 00:19:12,151
 I'll pick three samples and share them in the chatroom.

203
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,621
 - Everyone has to vote, okay? 
- Of course!

204
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:16,151
 The 9th Herinity's Night Preparatory Committee Meeting

205
00:19:20,261 --> 00:19:21,891
Next is...

206
00:19:23,261 --> 00:19:25,111
Hello!

207
00:19:30,881 --> 00:19:33,381
She's here! It's Lim Da Eun from the former girl group Angels!

208
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:34,731
You recognize her, right?

209
00:19:34,731 --> 00:19:37,471
She looks exactly the same as she did ten years ago!

210
00:19:37,471 --> 00:19:39,621
Oh, is this it?

211
00:19:46,721 --> 00:19:48,321
What is she doing here?

212
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:50,301
She's a member of Herinity OB*. 
  (*"Old Boy" term refers to alums of a certain group.)

213
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:52,741
The class before us. But more importantly...

214
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:57,971
Did this really come out of a free-spirited discussion?

215
00:19:57,971 --> 00:20:01,851
It was not an arbitrary decision made by one person, was it?

216
00:20:01,851 --> 00:20:04,321
What are you talking about, Da Eun?

217
00:20:05,741 --> 00:20:09,751
I only say that because the mood in the room seems so stiff.

218
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:14,551
Well, that could be because we have an unexpected guest.

219
00:20:20,361 --> 00:20:22,771
And this seating arrangement, too...

220
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:27,341
Doesn't it look like you're being ordered by a CEO?

221
00:20:28,211 --> 00:20:30,101
Don't you think so?

222
00:20:35,431 --> 00:20:37,081
Instead of sitting here like this,

223
00:20:37,081 --> 00:20:40,821
why don't we discuss this comfortably over brunch?

224
00:20:42,681 --> 00:20:46,181
Shall we, then? I was actually getting a little hungry.

225
00:21:01,411 --> 00:21:04,021
 Lim Da Eun came from a wealthy family.

226
00:21:04,021 --> 00:21:06,991
 So when she was active as an idol, they called her golden-spoon idol and things like that.

227
00:21:06,991 --> 00:21:10,831
 Now, she's married to the owner of the hospital right across the subway station.

228
00:21:10,831 --> 00:21:12,671
 Birds of a feather flock together.

229
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:16,231
 As you know, money brings money.

230
00:21:17,311 --> 00:21:19,411
Serves her right, doesn't it?

231
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:22,841
The almighty Song Jeong Ah is nothing next to Lim Da Eun.

232
00:21:22,841 --> 00:21:29,041
Do you know? Lim Da Eun is the admin of the Trinity 99 Mom Cafe chatroom.

233
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:30,331
 Oh, that's right!

234
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:33,561
 I didn't send you the link to the apartment mom's cafe, did I?

235
00:21:33,561 --> 00:21:35,481
 It says it's not the subscription period.

236
00:21:35,481 --> 00:21:37,701
 How could that be? Oh, my gosh.

237
00:21:37,701 --> 00:21:38,821
 I sent the wrong one.

238
00:21:38,821 --> 00:21:41,441
It's a kind of premium mom's cafe.

239
00:21:41,441 --> 00:21:44,121
To join, you have to submit recommendation letters.

240
00:21:44,121 --> 00:21:47,931
Even a certified copy of the family register or personal details report.

241
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:53,781
Basically, it means only verified people will gather and control this neighborhood.

242
00:21:56,071 --> 00:21:58,661
Another ridiculous thing is that to accept a new member,

243
00:21:58,661 --> 00:22:01,571
an existing member must drop out.

244
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:05,931
Supposedly, it's their rule to maintain 99 members or something.

245
00:22:07,711 --> 00:22:14,771
So, the new members must push out the chatroom member who's no longer qualified.

246
00:22:16,151 --> 00:22:19,021
It's a surefire method for quality control, though, isn't it?

247
00:22:19,021 --> 00:22:22,991
They say only the cafe staff can know all the contents.

248
00:22:22,991 --> 00:22:27,051
Yu Jin was that cafe's staff!

249
00:22:27,051 --> 00:22:28,211
Yu Jin was?

250
00:22:28,211 --> 00:22:33,951
Yeah. She probably possessed the most dirt on moms in this neighborhood.

251
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:48,081
Please give us two of these pastas and a rosé pasta as well.

252
00:22:48,081 --> 00:22:49,681
- And... 
- Is this sea cucumber?

253
00:22:49,681 --> 00:22:51,411
- Yes.
 - Oh, really?

254
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,851
How is this?

255
00:22:55,751 --> 00:22:57,891
I'm going to the restroom.

256
00:22:59,131 --> 00:23:01,281
I'm going to the restroom.

257
00:23:20,851 --> 00:23:24,001
 Did you recruit a lecturer for the Good Parenting class?

258
00:23:24,001 --> 00:23:27,721
You should show them what the 9th Class is capable of this time.

259
00:23:27,721 --> 00:23:32,621
If you need Dr. Choi Moon Kyeong's contact info, let me know.

260
00:23:34,421 --> 00:23:37,101
I don't think that would be necessary.

261
00:23:37,101 --> 00:23:40,331
It's excessive... I mean, undeserved attention.

262
00:23:40,331 --> 00:23:44,061
I heard you're so busy with the investor presentation these days.

263
00:23:44,061 --> 00:23:48,411
You can't neglect preparations for Herinity's Night because of that.

264
00:23:48,411 --> 00:23:49,631
You don't need to worry about—

265
00:23:49,631 --> 00:23:54,511
Isn't it an important event for you, Jeong Ah?

266
00:23:54,511 --> 00:23:55,891
You never know

267
00:23:55,891 --> 00:24:00,721
who else might be a big help to Inner Spirit this time.

268
00:24:02,271 --> 00:24:05,131
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

269
00:24:05,131 --> 00:24:08,551
I'm not trying to use Herinity's Night for my business.

270
00:24:08,551 --> 00:24:15,811
Although I'm grateful to those who think well of me and voluntarily invest in the company.

271
00:24:19,771 --> 00:24:24,311
You need to run the company well so those people don't change their minds.

272
00:24:24,311 --> 00:24:25,841
Of course.

273
00:24:25,841 --> 00:24:30,091
I believe we're repaying them enough with the company's various indicators.

274
00:24:33,801 --> 00:24:39,401
Right! I heard Oh Yu Jin's sister is taking care of her children right now.

275
00:24:41,321 --> 00:24:43,461
Was she there at the meeting?

276
00:24:43,461 --> 00:24:45,391
I completely forgot to ask earlier.

277
00:24:45,391 --> 00:24:46,611
Does she know too?

278
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:51,871
That you, Na Yeong, and Yu Jin were being pretty intense before Yu Jin died?

279
00:24:59,811 --> 00:25:01,741
I'll go ahead first.

280
00:25:12,361 --> 00:25:15,201
It's you! That time!

281
00:25:15,201 --> 00:25:19,671
Yes. Is your child's knee all right?

282
00:25:19,671 --> 00:25:21,861
I didn't know you were a mom at Herinity!

283
00:25:21,861 --> 00:25:24,931
Had I known, I wouldn't have said bye like that.

284
00:25:26,531 --> 00:25:28,471
Let's grab lunch sometime.

285
00:25:28,471 --> 00:25:30,831
- You know my number, right? 
- Yes.

286
00:25:42,891 --> 00:25:45,981
You lost this in the underground parking, didn't you?

287
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,491
Listen, Song Jeong Ah.

288
00:25:52,491 --> 00:25:54,291
Why did you send me something like this?

289
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:56,111
If you're curious, just ask.

290
00:25:56,111 --> 00:25:58,371
Don't test people with such immature tactics.

291
00:25:58,371 --> 00:26:00,021
What are you talking about?

292
00:26:00,021 --> 00:26:03,041
Can you say it in a coherent way?

293
00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:06,921
What kind of USB are you looking for? What is it for?

294
00:26:08,141 --> 00:26:11,861
What exactly happened before Yu Jin died?

295
00:26:13,601 --> 00:26:15,221
Why?

296
00:26:15,221 --> 00:26:18,431
So, this time, you can say that I killed Oh Yu Jin?

297
00:26:18,431 --> 00:26:20,121
- What?
 - Listen here, Ms. Jang.

298
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:23,541
Isn't it enough that you almost cost Na Yeong her life?

299
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:26,011
Why do you keep messing around in this neighborhood?

300
00:26:26,011 --> 00:26:28,641
What kind of nonsense are you spewing right now?

301
00:26:28,641 --> 00:26:31,691
If you set out to look for Oh Yu Jin's murderer now,

302
00:26:31,691 --> 00:26:35,251
do you think your past scandalous acts will somehow be erased?

303
00:26:35,251 --> 00:26:39,441
Why are you pretending to be her close sister now that she's dead?

304
00:26:40,671 --> 00:26:42,511
You dug up my background?

305
00:26:42,511 --> 00:26:46,431
You think I'd sit back when someone classless like you is creating a ruckus?

306
00:26:46,431 --> 00:26:48,491
Shut your mouth and get lost quietly.

307
00:26:48,491 --> 00:26:51,061
You don't want things to get ugly and you to be chased out.

308
00:27:20,591 --> 00:27:22,391
Gosh, what is it?

309
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:25,581
What USB is she talking about?

310
00:27:29,191 --> 00:27:30,971
- What's going on?
  - So, Oh Yu Jin...

311
00:27:30,971 --> 00:27:34,211
 You know how she posted everything on social media?

312
00:27:49,061 --> 00:27:54,991
Everyone! Playtime is until 1:50, okay?

313
00:28:04,721 --> 00:28:07,841
Lily, do you want to study, too?

314
00:28:17,591 --> 00:28:19,581
Where did you get that?

315
00:28:19,581 --> 00:28:20,711
It's mine.

316
00:28:20,711 --> 00:28:22,951
You can't bring things like this.

317
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,721
I'm going to tell the teacher.

318
00:28:24,721 --> 00:28:26,061
Give it to me!

319
00:28:26,061 --> 00:28:28,741
Give it to me!

00:28:44,151 --> 00:28:45,261
 ooo_yoojin

321
00:28:53,511 --> 00:28:56,431
 Coming soon. Pandora's Box.

322
00:28:56,431 --> 00:29:00,871
 The movie title is "Three-Carat Diamond's Secret and Blacklist."

323
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:02,961
 Did you customize your laptop?

324
00:29:02,961 --> 00:29:04,821
 Yool's mom has good sense!

325
00:29:04,821 --> 00:29:07,521
 Why is everyone talking about a three-carat diamond on this discussion board today?

326
00:29:07,521 --> 00:29:09,411
 Jeong Ah, too.

327
00:29:09,411 --> 00:29:12,531
 What about the rest of us who don't have a diamond?

328
00:29:12,531 --> 00:29:14,561
Same date.

329
00:29:14,561 --> 00:29:16,991
 spirit_ssong

330
00:29:20,901 --> 00:29:23,461
 He said it's our 10th anniversary gift.

331
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:26,361
 I don't need it. But anyway, thank you, hubby.

332
00:29:26,361 --> 00:29:29,081
 The three-carat diamond was so bright that it almost blinded me.

333
00:29:29,081 --> 00:29:31,851
 Oh, my! Your necklace is so pretty!

334
00:29:31,851 --> 00:29:34,181
 When will I ever receive something like that?

335
00:29:34,181 --> 00:29:37,951
 But is that okay? Seems it might be too much for him.

336
00:29:37,951 --> 00:29:40,381
 I'll just watch a movie.

337
00:29:44,501 --> 00:29:46,881
 The three-carat diamond was so bright it almost blinded me.

338
00:29:46,881 --> 00:29:50,831
 The movie title is "Three-Carat Diamond's Secret and Blacklist."

339
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:53,001
Diamond...

340
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:55,911
It seems like they're mocking this, but...

341
00:29:57,711 --> 00:29:58,981
USB?

342
00:29:58,981 --> 00:30:03,001
 They say only the cafe staff can know everything.

343
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:05,761
 Yu Jin was that cafe's staff!

344
00:30:05,761 --> 00:30:10,771
 She probably had the most dirt on moms in this neighborhood.

345
00:30:16,001 --> 00:30:18,481
Ha Yool, it's okay. You can fix this when you get home.

346
00:30:18,481 --> 00:30:20,031
No! I don't want to!

347
00:30:20,031 --> 00:30:21,911
Then, what should we do?

348
00:30:21,911 --> 00:30:24,521
What do you want us to do with the doll?

349
00:30:34,551 --> 00:30:38,401
All right. So I'll bury Lily now.

350
00:30:51,361 --> 00:30:52,631
There.

351
00:30:53,491 --> 00:30:55,001
We're done.

352
00:30:59,521 --> 00:31:02,731
Lily, goodbye.

353
00:31:02,731 --> 00:31:07,411
Can't we plant the memory tree, too?

354
00:31:07,411 --> 00:31:09,301
That's...

355
00:31:10,281 --> 00:31:12,431
Let's think about that more and decide.

356
00:31:13,831 --> 00:31:15,781
Shall we go inside?

357
00:31:15,781 --> 00:31:17,351
Let's go!

358
00:31:20,391 --> 00:31:22,501
Ha Yool, you go in first.

359
00:31:26,871 --> 00:31:28,261
Let's go.

360
00:31:54,811 --> 00:32:01,401
 3:40pm: Ji Yool, Ha Yool after school pickup

361
00:32:01,401 --> 00:32:02,851
 Bye!

362
00:32:03,611 --> 00:32:05,911
Is your bag heavy? Give it to me.

363
00:32:05,911 --> 00:32:08,401
It's okay. I'll carry it.

364
00:32:11,401 --> 00:32:12,781
Like this.

365
00:32:12,781 --> 00:32:15,231
You look even cuter with it in the front.

366
00:32:22,681 --> 00:32:24,771
Do you want a hot dog, So Won?

367
00:32:27,881 --> 00:32:29,251
So Won!

368
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:32,291
What were you doing?

369
00:32:34,871 --> 00:32:36,411
Isn't this...

370
00:32:39,021 --> 00:32:40,721
By chance...

371
00:32:41,721 --> 00:32:43,591
Did you bring someone else's things home?

372
00:32:43,591 --> 00:32:48,221
No, it was thrown away.

373
00:32:50,991 --> 00:32:54,091
Why did you bring something that was thrown away?

374
00:32:54,091 --> 00:32:55,171
Are you a beggar?

375
00:32:55,171 --> 00:32:59,071
No, it's not that...

376
00:32:59,071 --> 00:33:02,101
Don't you think I can't buy you something like this?

377
00:33:02,101 --> 00:33:04,961
Do you know what kind of daughter you are to me!

378
00:33:08,961 --> 00:33:12,301
I'm sorry. So Won, I'm sorry.

379
00:33:12,301 --> 00:33:15,911
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I got mad.

380
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:17,031
Don't cry.

381
00:33:17,031 --> 00:33:19,101
Oh, you're pretty.

382
00:33:34,701 --> 00:33:36,631
Should I wash this for you?

383
00:33:37,481 --> 00:33:41,071
Mom. You know...

384
00:33:46,501 --> 00:33:49,051
Auntie, it's dripping.

385
00:33:49,051 --> 00:33:51,831
What? Oh, oh, yeah.

386
00:33:52,761 --> 00:33:57,091
Auntie, I'm going to plant the memory tree tomorrow.

387
00:33:57,091 --> 00:33:58,851
Really? Whose tree is it?

388
00:33:58,851 --> 00:34:03,121
Lily. Ha Rool took her doll to school today.

389
00:34:07,421 --> 00:34:10,971
Lily got stuck in the door.

390
00:34:10,971 --> 00:34:14,561
And went to heaven like Mom.

391
00:34:14,561 --> 00:34:18,761
So, the Teacher and I buried her together.

392
00:34:19,881 --> 00:34:22,431
You must have been very sad.

393
00:34:22,431 --> 00:34:26,441
But from now on, let's play with dolls only at home. Okay?

394
00:34:26,441 --> 00:34:30,311
I was going to study together with Lily.

395
00:34:30,311 --> 00:34:32,821
I packed her bag, too.

396
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:36,701
With her books and her sparkly jewel.

397
00:34:36,701 --> 00:34:40,151
Sparkly jewel?

398
00:34:40,151 --> 00:34:42,241
Stupid, it wasn't a sparkly jewel. It was a USB.

399
00:34:43,241 --> 00:34:46,941
Ji Yool, do you know what USB is?

400
00:34:46,941 --> 00:34:50,341
Yes. The one in the office. Mom's.

401
00:35:09,191 --> 00:35:11,901
I definitely threw it in here...

402
00:35:20,501 --> 00:35:22,731
Auntie, are you angry?

403
00:35:22,731 --> 00:35:25,861
Because I took the doll?

404
00:35:25,861 --> 00:35:28,341
No, I'm not angry.

405
00:35:32,481 --> 00:35:35,231
What shall we play at home?

406
00:35:37,821 --> 00:35:39,421
Wait a minute.

407
00:35:41,381 --> 00:35:43,361
 Do you want to come over for dinner with the kids?

408
00:35:43,361 --> 00:35:45,491
 So Won wants to invite them.

409
00:35:47,371 --> 00:35:48,771
Do you want to go to So Won's?

410
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,651
Auntie said she'll make this for you.

411
00:35:51,631 --> 00:35:53,911
- Yes.
 - Sounds good.

412
00:36:14,551 --> 00:36:18,041
I can't even drink cold water in front of the kids.

413
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:20,711
She might tattle on me to her dad.

414
00:36:24,781 --> 00:36:29,041
By the way, Ms. Hwang. I have something to ask you.

415
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:30,641
Oh. Yes.

416
00:36:30,641 --> 00:36:37,781
You know how you said earlier that Yu Jin might possess the most secrets of the moms?

417
00:36:37,781 --> 00:36:41,561
Was there a reason why you used the word "possess"?

418
00:36:46,111 --> 00:36:48,341
Did I say that?

419
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:55,591
Is there a reason I shouldn't say it like that?

420
00:36:57,941 --> 00:37:01,331
No, I was just curious.

421
00:37:11,031 --> 00:37:12,731
Let's go.

422
00:37:23,601 --> 00:37:26,421
- We'll get going.
 - All right. Bye.

423
00:37:26,421 --> 00:37:29,651
- Bye, So Won!
- Bye! See you tomorrow!

424
00:37:29,651 --> 00:37:32,351
Oh, right. Wait a moment, okay?

425
00:37:37,251 --> 00:37:39,831
- Here.
 - Wow!

426
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:46,951
She's so kind and tenderhearted like this!

427
00:37:46,951 --> 00:37:49,671
She even wrapped the band-aid on it herself.

428
00:37:49,671 --> 00:37:51,611
Ha Yool, say thank you.

429
00:37:51,611 --> 00:37:53,681
Thank you, Eonni!

430
00:38:06,691 --> 00:38:09,491
Go straight to the bathroom, Ji Yool, Ha Yool.

431
00:38:45,521 --> 00:38:47,181
 Pandora's Box

432
00:38:50,541 --> 00:38:54,211
 Coming soon. Pandora's box.

433
00:38:56,101 --> 00:38:59,401
 Kang Do Joon, Kang Min Ho, Kim Na Yeong, Kim Ju Yeon, Baek Seong Hui, Song Jeong Ah

434
00:38:59,401 --> 00:39:02,201
 Lee So Min, Jang Mi Ho, Hwang Ji Hye

435
00:39:06,001 --> 00:39:07,701
 Jang Mi Ho, Password

436
00:39:11,381 --> 00:39:13,361
 Kang Do Joon, Password

437
00:39:54,491 --> 00:39:58,541
Mr. Han, you said you saw Jang Mi Ho in the underground parking garage last time.

438
00:39:58,541 --> 00:40:01,161
Didn't it look like she was with someone?

439
00:40:09,831 --> 00:40:11,651
 I'm sorry.

440
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:16,301
It seemed like she was doing something at the communal locker.

441
00:40:16,301 --> 00:40:18,131
I didn't see anyone else there while I was there.

442
00:40:18,131 --> 00:40:20,901
 No, there must have been.

443
00:40:20,901 --> 00:40:23,541
- Excuse me?
 - I'm saying that someone else was there.

444
00:40:23,541 --> 00:40:25,751
 Should I check?

445
00:40:25,751 --> 00:40:27,251
That's all right.

446
00:40:31,001 --> 00:40:32,781
 Why did you send me something like this?

447
00:40:32,781 --> 00:40:34,791
 What kind of USB are you looking for?

448
00:40:34,791 --> 00:40:36,751
 What is it for?

449
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:41,731
 What exactly happened before Yu Jin died?

450
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:17,181
 Brutal images of murder

451
00:41:29,801 --> 00:41:31,711
 Save image under another name

452
00:41:33,151 --> 00:41:35,131
Why can't you do it?

453
00:41:36,151 --> 00:41:37,331
It's not yours, is it?

454
00:41:37,331 --> 00:41:39,471
We don't really do unlocking passwords these days.

455
00:41:39,471 --> 00:41:41,351
If issues arise, it's more of a headache for us.

456
00:41:41,351 --> 00:41:43,151
Isn't there a way?

457
00:41:43,151 --> 00:41:44,831
No, there isn't.

458
00:41:49,481 --> 00:41:51,381
We don't do things like this.

459
00:41:51,381 --> 00:41:53,191
Try elsewhere.

460
00:41:54,191 --> 00:41:56,881
This seems a little difficult...

461
00:41:59,701 --> 00:42:01,491
I can't, I can't.

462
00:42:05,631 --> 00:42:07,361
Wait a minute.

463
00:42:10,121 --> 00:42:12,221
I don't know if they'll do it.

464
00:42:12,221 --> 00:42:15,081
If you don't call beforehand, they may be closed.
 Deokwang Electronics

465
00:42:22,931 --> 00:42:25,041
What in the world?

466
00:42:31,621 --> 00:42:35,451
Eonni, is this true?

467
00:43:15,961 --> 00:43:18,131
 spirit_ssong

468
00:43:19,521 --> 00:43:23,171
 As you all know, our apartment building was in disarray for a while

469
00:43:23,171 --> 00:43:25,661
 because of one person claiming to search for the truth

470
00:43:25,661 --> 00:43:29,631
 behind Oh Yu Jin's death and poking around our Herinity community.

471
00:43:29,631 --> 00:43:33,871
 In the end, a mom who could not withstand being accused of murder

472
00:43:33,871 --> 00:43:37,411
 even tried to attempt suicide.

473
00:43:37,411 --> 00:43:40,901
 When it was discovered that she seduced her stepfather in her high school years,

474
00:43:40,901 --> 00:43:46,801
 you started hurting Oh Yu Jin and made it look like suicide.

475
00:43:46,801 --> 00:43:50,971
 Is it a coincidence that Oh Yu Jin was murdered

476
00:43:50,971 --> 00:43:53,061
 right after meeting this person?

477
00:43:53,061 --> 00:43:59,411
 Is it right to leave Oh Yu Jin's precious children in the hands of this person?

478
00:44:05,961 --> 00:44:07,471
 Kim Sang Won

479
00:44:08,561 --> 00:44:12,161
 The perpetrator is Jang Mi Ho. A deputy at DG Bank, Digital Division.

480
00:44:12,161 --> 00:44:16,831
 Jang Mi Ho and Oh Yu Jin have been estranged since high school and met recently.

481
00:44:16,831 --> 00:44:18,591
 But Oh Yu Jin was stabbed to death.

482
00:44:18,591 --> 00:44:20,041
 Don't you think there's a connection?

483
00:44:20,041 --> 00:44:22,331
 Kim Sang Won? It's been a long time.

484
00:44:22,331 --> 00:44:23,961
 - This was a well-known incident.
 - Jang Mi Ho?

485
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:25,281
 I remember now.

486
00:44:25,281 --> 00:44:27,271
 Oh Yu Jin died after seeing Jang Mi Ho?

487
00:44:27,271 --> 00:44:29,641
 Wow, this stinks of foul play.

488
00:44:29,641 --> 00:44:33,741
K-Kim Sang Won. Who is that?

489
00:44:35,581 --> 00:44:37,901
 Who are you, and why are you spreading false information?

490
00:44:37,901 --> 00:44:39,541
 Remove your post immediately.

491
00:44:39,541 --> 00:44:43,331
 I'll report you to the police for defamation and spreading false information.

492
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:50,180
 So Dam

493
00:44:57,151 --> 00:44:59,761
Then, what's going to happen to the children?

494
00:44:59,761 --> 00:45:04,261
What do you mean? We have to call Yu Jin's father-in-law again, or...

495
00:45:04,261 --> 00:45:06,371
should we take turns taking care of them?

496
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:09,601
What if she insists on becoming their legal guardian later?

497
00:45:09,601 --> 00:45:12,811
It's only a matter of time before she takes over their entire inheritance.

498
00:45:17,541 --> 00:45:20,061
Where is Song Jeong Ah right now?

499
00:45:23,961 --> 00:45:26,041
Why are you looking for me?

500
00:45:30,361 --> 00:45:31,831
Take down the post right now.

501
00:45:31,831 --> 00:45:35,611
Why? I just revealed the truth exactly as it is.

502
00:45:35,611 --> 00:45:39,001
The whole thing was fabricated.

503
00:45:39,001 --> 00:45:41,881
After fighting with you, one person died,

504
00:45:41,881 --> 00:45:44,341
and another person attempted suicide.

505
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:47,341
So you're saying all this is an amazing coincidence?

506
00:45:47,341 --> 00:45:52,291
Look here. That's not a coincidence. It's called cause and effect.

507
00:45:54,021 --> 00:45:58,311
Do you think I don't know why you're doing this?

508
00:45:59,211 --> 00:46:03,011
This is how far you'll go to kick me out?

509
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:05,101
But this is all you got?

510
00:46:05,101 --> 00:46:08,521
I can just ignore such childish slander.

511
00:46:08,521 --> 00:46:13,501
You say you can just ignore it yet ran down here asking me to take it down?

512
00:46:13,501 --> 00:46:17,151
Well, I guess the problem would be more for the kids than you.

513
00:46:17,151 --> 00:46:20,231
All right, go ahead and ignore it.

514
00:46:20,231 --> 00:46:24,791
Let's see how long you'll last in this neighborhood when everyone

515
00:46:24,791 --> 00:46:26,721
turns their back on you.

516
00:46:39,621 --> 00:46:43,561
 Do you think I don't know why you're doing this?

517
00:46:43,561 --> 00:46:46,071
She probably couldn't open it.

518
00:46:49,481 --> 00:46:51,631
 spirit_ssong: As you all know, our apartment building was in disarray for a while...

519
00:46:53,711 --> 00:46:54,891
 Bannae-dong moms' meeting

520
00:46:56,461 --> 00:46:57,861
 High Prestige Apartment

521
00:47:03,711 --> 00:47:07,491
 Oh, my goodness! I can't believe how someone so convoluted and crazy exists.

522
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:11,131
 I'm so shocked that one person can muddy up a community like this.

523
00:47:11,131 --> 00:47:13,651
 Shouldn't we do something about a person this dangerous?

524
00:47:13,651 --> 00:47:15,361
 Shouldn't we report her?

525
00:47:15,361 --> 00:47:17,701
 - Wow! Daebak.
 - I tremble thinking about it.

526
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:20,581
 - That someone like this lives close by... 
- It's crazy. Crazy!

527
00:47:20,581 --> 00:47:23,051
 - It's too horrifying. 
- So crazy. I'm lost for words.

528
00:47:23,051 --> 00:47:26,341
 It's from Inner Spirit's Song Jeong Ah. Of course, it's true.

529
00:47:26,341 --> 00:47:27,821
 It's so absurd. I'm speechless.

530
00:47:27,821 --> 00:47:32,031
 - Are the kids all right? 
- She has the kids now.

531
00:47:50,431 --> 00:47:51,941
 - Take care of yourself. I'll be there as soon as I'm done.
- Okay. I'm going home today.

532
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:11,990
 Inpergram

533
00:48:19,181 --> 00:48:22,091
Principal, I'm Ah Rin's mother.

534
00:48:22,091 --> 00:48:24,271
Could I speak with Ah Rin, please?

535
00:48:24,271 --> 00:48:27,421
 Ah Rin didn't come to school today.

536
00:48:27,421 --> 00:48:30,821
- Excuse me?
  - Ms. Jo said she spoke to you.

537
00:48:30,821 --> 00:48:32,401
Then, let me speak to Ms. Jo.

538
00:48:32,401 --> 00:48:36,981
 Ms. Jo resigned today.

539
00:48:42,101 --> 00:48:45,281
 The man who can't live without me ♥

540
00:48:45,281 --> 00:48:48,551
 The phone is turned off. You'll be connected to the voicemail.

541
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:50,521
 Ms. Jo Ah Ra

542
00:48:50,521 --> 00:48:54,521
 The phone is turned off. You'll be connected to the voicemail.

543
00:48:54,521 --> 00:48:56,121
 arara_joara has a new post

544
00:48:56,121 --> 00:48:57,591
 On my way to watch a concert!

545
00:48:57,591 --> 00:49:00,931
 "T.T. Cherry!" My babe has child-like tastes

546
00:49:00,931 --> 00:49:02,761
 #Preparing to be a mom.

547
00:49:02,761 --> 00:49:04,881
 #3 months before the wedding.

548
00:49:04,881 --> 00:49:07,991
 #A date with you, babe.

549
00:49:17,241 --> 00:49:21,011
I'm sorry, but could you go to Rianata House?

550
00:49:21,011 --> 00:49:22,351
Okay.

551
00:49:28,461 --> 00:49:30,021
- Wasn't it good? 
- Did you like it?

552
00:49:30,021 --> 00:49:31,551
It was a lot of fun dad 
   T.T. Cherry

553
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:33,391
Oh, you're right. Wasn't it so fun?

554
00:49:33,391 --> 00:49:34,681
Yes.

555
00:49:34,681 --> 00:49:37,701
 The woman who can't live without me ♥ - 6 missed calls

556
00:49:37,701 --> 00:49:39,241
 The woman who can't live without me ♥

557
00:49:43,261 --> 00:49:44,511
 The man who can't live without me ♥

558
00:49:47,741 --> 00:49:50,411
- Yes. 
- How come you called so many times?

559
00:49:50,411 --> 00:49:52,471
I had it off for a little while.

560
00:49:53,531 --> 00:49:56,191
Honey, where are you now?

561
00:49:56,191 --> 00:49:57,641
Me?

562
00:49:59,021 --> 00:50:01,721
I came to watch a concert with my employee and Ah Rin.

563
00:50:01,721 --> 00:50:05,701
Ever since you went into the hospital, Ah Rin seems unsettled.

564
00:50:05,701 --> 00:50:07,701
Didn't I mention it before?

565
00:50:07,701 --> 00:50:09,761
Where are you, Honey?

566
00:50:09,761 --> 00:50:11,261
I'm at the hospital.

567
00:50:11,261 --> 00:50:14,381
Good. It's too soon for you to leave the hospital.

568
00:50:14,381 --> 00:50:15,921
Rest up until you are all better.

569
00:50:15,921 --> 00:50:17,631
Dad!

570
00:50:17,631 --> 00:50:20,591
I have to hang up now. I'll be there later.

571
00:50:20,591 --> 00:50:23,211
Let's go! What shall we eat?

572
00:50:23,211 --> 00:50:24,491
Anything you want to eat?

573
00:50:24,491 --> 00:50:26,431
Something yummy?

574
00:50:40,061 --> 00:50:43,671
Sir! Is anyone there?

575
00:50:43,671 --> 00:50:45,501
Sir!

576
00:50:49,931 --> 00:50:51,851
 For compensation, I will pay an additional 2 million won on top of what you charge.

577
00:50:51,851 --> 00:50:55,571
 Please call me. 010-912-9339.

578
00:51:22,541 --> 00:51:24,731
 You were showing off your husband so much.

579
00:51:24,731 --> 00:51:29,351
 Look at how pathetic you are now.

580
00:53:04,861 --> 00:53:05,951
Kim Sang Won?

581
00:53:05,951 --> 00:53:08,371
Yes. Can you look into him for me?

582
00:53:08,371 --> 00:53:09,871
I have a weird feeling about it.

583
00:53:09,871 --> 00:53:11,581
Of course, we have to explain it.

584
00:53:11,581 --> 00:53:15,531
There has to be at least one person from Seora High in the bank. I'll find out.

585
00:53:15,531 --> 00:53:18,081
 How could she spread such absurd rumors?

586
00:53:18,081 --> 00:53:20,021
 Even I feel wronged!

587
00:53:22,901 --> 00:53:26,051
You and the kids are all okay, right?

588
00:53:27,051 --> 00:53:29,171
Yes, don't worry.

589
00:53:29,971 --> 00:53:31,681
I'm hanging up.

590
00:54:05,581 --> 00:54:07,881
Get rid of it completely.

591
00:54:11,511 --> 00:54:13,521
Jeong Sik is doing well, right?

592
00:54:50,271 --> 00:54:51,461
I live downstairs.

593
00:54:51,461 --> 00:54:53,991
I came by a few times, but you weren't home.

594
00:54:53,991 --> 00:54:56,351
Hello. How can I help you?

595
00:54:56,351 --> 00:54:57,671
Gosh—

596
00:54:58,971 --> 00:55:02,501
Shouldn't we have basic courtesy as neighbors?

597
00:55:02,501 --> 00:55:05,781
My parents can't sleep because of the loud thumping in your unit!

598
00:55:05,781 --> 00:55:07,471
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

599
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:11,571
My old parents didn't want to get upset with neighbors, so they kept it to themselves.

600
00:55:11,571 --> 00:55:15,881
But after staying with them for a few days, I see this is intolerable.

601
00:55:15,881 --> 00:55:19,881
I'm really sorry. I'll be sure to talk to the kids very firmly.

602
00:55:19,881 --> 00:55:22,701
Please do that. All right?

603
00:56:13,011 --> 00:56:14,111
Delivery.

604
00:56:14,111 --> 00:56:15,231
 Complaint

605
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:40,701
Yes. Did you find out?

606
00:56:42,891 --> 00:56:45,401
Ms. Jang, where are you right now?

607
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:48,871
An anonymous letter was sent to the company.

619
00:58:09,251 --> 00:58:11,551
 The complaint was not only registered but came in officially.

620
00:58:11,551 --> 00:58:13,243
 So, we can't not investigate this!

621
00:58:13,243 --> 00:58:16,568
 You mean my past or the murder charge?

622
00:58:16,568 --> 00:58:20,193
 Whether you leave or I leave, let's go all the way.

623
00:58:20,193 --> 00:58:22,191
 The kids want to play with So Won.

624
00:58:22,191 --> 00:58:24,211
 That's too bad.

625
00:58:24,211 --> 00:58:25,751
 I'm at work right now.

626
00:58:25,751 --> 00:58:27,481
 I guess you don't want her to find out.

627
00:58:27,481 --> 00:58:30,181
 Someone with a tattoo on this arm!

628
00:58:30,181 --> 00:58:31,481
 I don't think so...

629
00:58:31,481 --> 00:58:33,211
 If this gets out...

630
00:58:33,211 --> 00:58:36,261
 not only you, but all of us will be finished!

631
00:58:36,261 --> 00:58:40,611
 This won't end with you going to prison!

632
00:58:40,611 --> 00:58:43,961
 I plan to reveal everything in Herinity's chatroom.

633
00:58:43,961 --> 00:58:47,161
♫  I don't know where the end is  ♫

634
00:58:47,161 --> 00:58:50,376
 Accusing another mom as a murderer,

635
00:58:50,376 --> 00:58:55,101
 causing her serious psychological harm and straining the community...

636
00:58:55,101 --> 00:58:57,716
 Aren't you all curious?

637
00:58:57,716 --> 00:59:01,191
 Why Song Jeong Ah is going to such great lengths to push me out.

638
00:59:01,191 --> 00:59:07,951
 I'd like to hear the truth about that today.
