 Battle For Happiness

11
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,580
 This is a work of fiction. Characters, locations, agencies, incidents, organizations, and jobs have no relation to real life.

12
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,610
 After 9:20 pm, the day Yu Jin died.

13
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,240
 It means they took this parcel before the police came.

14
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,060
 They might've been at the crime scene.

15
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,130
 Maybe they are a witness or an accomplice.

16
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,420
 Or the culprit.

17
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,580
 What if I do have a confession?

18
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,960
 Another suspect's confession.

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,120
 Let's really make a deal this time.

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,160
 On my way down on the elevator,

21
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,840
 Min Seong's father got on at the 10th floor.

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,470
 You had a wild past.

23
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,830
 And why did you meet so frequently with Oh Yu Jin before she died?

24
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,060
 I said I had nothing to do with her!

25
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,100
 Do you know why Yu Jin died?

26
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,120
 You can't find out anything without me.

27
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:25,480
 But really, what actually happened that day? Can't you tell me now?

28
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,020
 I stabbed her.

29
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,000
 Previously

30
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:43,450

31
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,700
 Help...

32
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,410
 You know...

33
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,520
I stabbed her.

34
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,090
I said I stabbed Yu Jin.

35
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,900
Is that the kind of response you were expecting?

36
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,600
It's just my drunken ramblings.

37
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,010
Besides,

38
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,200
let's just say that I stabbed her.

39
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,400
Who would believe that I stabbed her when there's no motive or evidence?

40
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,070
Kang Do Joon, it's not all over yet.

41
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,200
Even if the case is dismissed,

42
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,360
if there is someone out there who is determined enough,

43
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,500
a crucial lead can sometimes be found.

44
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,810
I'm sure you'll handle it.

45
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:55,010
But it's a problem if you leave the possibility for that to happen open.

46
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,700
 December 1, 2022. Four days before Oh Yu Jin's death

47
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,390
I told you I can't!

48
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,200
 Recording

49
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,560
 200 million won for getting rid of someone is chump change.

50
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,010
 I have what you want.

51
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,990
 You have it?

52
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,540
 Don't lie.

53
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:33,450
 I'm telling you, I really have it. Why can't you believe me?

54
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,520
 Even if the case is dismissed,

55
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,680
 if there is someone out there who is determined enough,

56
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,410
 a crucial lead can sometimes be found.

57
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:52,170
 But it's a problem if you leave the possibility for that to happen open.

 Episode 13

59
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,630
 What's between you and Yu Jin?

60
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:06,450
 That person and I don't have any kind of relationship!

61
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,840
 Nothing happened!

62
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,130
 Jeong Su Bin.

63
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,950
 Jeong Su Bin.

64
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,660
He's not here.

65
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,670
 Jeong Su Bin

66
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,020
 No results for "Jeong Su Bin"

67
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,640
 Being a workaholic is tacky.

68
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,770
  Resting is the real way to be a CEO.

69
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,220
 You guys look so happy!

70
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,710
 Living the good life, Jeong Su Bin!

71
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,190
 What a lucky guy!

72
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,520
 Seems like it. He still has his old habits of mooching off of women.

73
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,250
 Song Jeong Sik.

74
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,330
 Song Jeong Ah.

75
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,590
 Song Jeong Ah's younger brother?

76
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,950
 You should know your place as one leeching off of a woman.

77
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:59,200
 Hey. I will make sure you get divorced from my noona.

78
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,460
 Please stop this!

79
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,620

Hello. This is Jang Mi Ho.

80
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,460
 You're Song Jeong Ah's younger brother, right?

81
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,990
 I met you at a club in Hannam-dong once.

82
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:17,110
 I just have something to ask you about Jeong Su Bin.

83
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,510
 If it's all right, may I meet with you ?

84
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:25,050
 Oh, I remember who you are.

85
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,420
 Please tell me a time and place.

86
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,310
 Okay. I'll see you then!

87
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:44,530
 You should be prepared. I'm going to order an expensive dish.

88
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,290
 I'm going to meet that woman tomorrow, Jang Mi Ho.

89
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,690
 Do you know what you need to do?

90
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,620
 The more evidence you've gathered, the better it is.

91
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,520
 If you're firm in your decision, I'll submit the complaint.

92
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,840
Ms. Jo. What's going on?

93
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,680
Ms. Kim.

94
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,960
Let's go inside for now.

95
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:58,070
I really had absolutely no intention of doing that.

96
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:01,980
Why would I fall in love with a married man with a child? Am I crazy?

97
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,560
He was coming onto me so aggressively.

98
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,870
Even now, he's begging me to marry him. Saying that he will get a divorce.

99
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,980
But it weighs heavy on my conscience,

100
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:18,010
and I don't know what to do.

101
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,980
That's why I'm telling you everything.

102
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,120
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

103
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,780
You must have been suffering a lot.

104
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,990
Then, what do you want to do?

105
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:34,190
Do you want to marry that married man?

106
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,420
Or do you want to end things?

107
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,100
I want to end things, but...

108
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,100
in my belly...

109
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,700
You already went to the point of no return.

110
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,020
But Ms. Jo, don't you feel bad for his wife?

111
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:01,180
Because of your actions, you'll be called a home-wrecker forever.

112
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,520
As for that man, he deserves to be divorced, but...

113
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,120
what about his innocent wife and child?

114
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,650
That wife is also quite a character.

115
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,660
Don't you think there's a reason why men have affairs?

116
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,060
Who knows.

117
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,960
Even before we get to that,

118
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:21,290
do you think a man who cheats is a decent human being?

119
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,880
In any case, I hope you pull yourself together soon.

120
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,850
In my opinion,

121
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:32,170
I don't think that wife is completely oblivious.

122
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,430
What would she do even if she knew?

123
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,240
Nothing would change even if she knew.

124
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,010
That's what you think, Ms. Jo.

125
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:43,730
You probably wouldn't ever be able to imagine how that wife is

126
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:47,010
secretly sharpening her knife.

127
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,880
She wouldn't end things merely with a divorce.

128
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:55,490
She'll crush what's most important.

129
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,940
Eat before you go!

130
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,510
What would you like to eat?

131
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,800
No, that's all right.

132
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,190
Oh, and this.

133
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:07,260
I'm grateful for everything you've done for me.

134
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,790
Thank you. I'll enjoy it.

135
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:16,940
Right. I had something to give you.

136
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,280
This is something I use.

137
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,300
I don't know if you've been stressing, but your face isn't in good shape.

138
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,930
Here. Try it.

139
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,720
It'll help your skin.

140
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,690
Here.

141
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,520
You're too generous.

142
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,400
It's nothing. Just try it.

143
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,140
 Ah Ra

144
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:48,960
Why? What now?

145
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,140
 Do you know who I was with just now?

146
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,550
How should I...

147
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,810
Hey, you!

148
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,280
Are you crazy?

149
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,540
Just be relieved that I didn't tell her everything.

150
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,800
 - You still have a chance.  
- You crazy...

151
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,030
I'm not doing down alone, no matter what.

152
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:10,040
Even if I do, I'm dragging you down with me!

153
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,800
Hey, even if I got divorced, I wouldn't marry a venomous girl like you!

154
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,480
Then you'd be completely on your own

155
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,700
and live as a single mother! You know?

156
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,170
Single mother?

157
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,170
How naive of you.

158
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:26,300
- What does that mean?
 - None of your business.

159
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,310
Let's see who is brought to their knees first.

160
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,770
What are you talking about! Speak clearly!

161
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:35,600
Hey! Hey!

162
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,380
Seems like you've been running around everywhere for a while now.

163
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,020
What do you want to know from me?

164
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:02,710
I saw what you wrote about Jeong Su Bin on Song Jeong Ah's social media.

165
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:05,760
That he still has his old habits of mooching off of women.

166
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,880
I think you said something similar at the club last time, too.

167
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,050
Oh, did I?

168
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,400
So, why are you curious about that?

169
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:22,120
Oh, you think maybe Jeong Su Bin killed

170
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,290
Oh Yu Jin when she threatened him?

171
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:31,490
Is there something you know?

172
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,490
I know enough.

173
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,660
Jeong Su Bin has a secret big enough to kill Oh Yu Jin over.

174
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,320
That's what I'm saying.

175
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,150
Wait, Song Jeong Ah!

176
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,830
Song Jeong Ah!

177
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,060
You crazy...

178
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:02,200
Come here! Die! Die!

179
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,010
Did you do drugs again!

180
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,500
- Song Jeong Ah!
 - Open the door!

181
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,880
Could you please open the door here!

182
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,660
- Noona!
 - Here!

183
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,140
Noona! Wait a minute!

184
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,240
Don't you think I know what that bastard threatened you with?

185
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,820
That you used to work at a host bar. Did you think I didn't know?

186
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,810
H-Honey, h-how did you...

187
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:49,130
You don't actually believe Su Bin would have killed Oh Yu Jin over such a small secret, do you?

188
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:52,900
For Jeong Su Bin, it might not have been a small secret.

189
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,880
If Jeong Su Bin didn't know that you knew his secret,

190
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,000
he would have wanted to keep it hidden even more.

191
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,530
This is the money he brought because that bastard threatened him.

192
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:13,290
Begging, pleading, and giving money.

193
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,680
This is Su Bin's way.

194
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:25,860
This amount is too large for just keeping his mouth shut.

195
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,530
Are you sure Jeong Su Bin's secret is only about having worked at a host bar?

196
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,010
Even if that's true,

197
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,450
he didn't do that to Oh Yu Jin.

198
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,080
Then, I guess he could tell us.

199
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,460
Jeong Su Bin, what were you doing on the day Oh Yu Jin died?

200
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,670
 Emergency call

201
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,440
Is this the police? I want to report an assault.

202
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,470
Someone hit me with a bottle...

203
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,300
Are you crazy!

204
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,370
You also need to experience how crazy it feels to be accused unfairly.

205
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:09,040
Destroying someone? That's easy for me.

206
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,160
I would do anything to protect my family.

207
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,530
You go ahead.

208
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,900
Honey.

209
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,800
Later. Let's talk later.

210
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,770
No, now. L-Let's talk now.

211
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,080
Now.

212
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,790
Noona, there are so many things I want to tell you.

213
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,970
I...

214
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,890
I've been thinking about it a lot, and...

215
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,750
About what?

216
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:51,050
Why do I need to hear about you fooling around with other women?

217
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,240
What's that got to do with me?

218
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,710
In the end, I didn't marry you for love, either.

219
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:59,510
I married you because I thought you would listen to me.

220
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,780
- Don't talk like that.
 - But,

221
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,930
I want to slap that old me.

222
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:14,590
How are you different than a pimp who sucks the life out of a woman?

223
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:18,710
Mooching off of me like a leech for money.

224
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,130
You're no different from Jeong Sik.

225
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,420
It hurts!

226
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,470
If you approach Su Bin one more time, you're finished.

227
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,680
Then, I won't care if you're my brother or not.

228
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,550
No matter what you threaten him with, I won't kick Su Bin out.

229
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,810
 Come back after you clear your mind.

230
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,460
 That you used to work at a host bar.

231
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,320
 H-Honey, h-how did you...

232
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:00,300
 You don't actually believe Su Bin would have killed Oh Yu Jin over such a small secret, do you?

233
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:04,110
 Begging, pleading, and giving money.

234
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,420
 This is Su Bin's way.

235
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,880
I found one.

236
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,370
The day Oh Yu Jin died,

237
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:22,360
Jeong Su Bin was out to dinner with his coworkers.

238
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,930
This isn't enough.

239
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,330
It's not a definite alibi.

240
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,720
But you said Song Jeong Ah is really fired up right now.

241
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,120
Oh, what do we do?

242
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,740
In any case, I did DM the person who posted it.

243
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,400
Assistant Manager Jang!

244
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,860
My husband didn't do it.

245
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,510
Did you come all the way here to tell me the same thing as yesterday?

246
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,180
Hwang Ji Hye.

247
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:07,940
I heard that woman saw my husband on the 10th floor.

248
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,780
My husband told me the opposite.

249
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:14,030
How much do you trust that woman?

250
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,260
Check for yourself.

251
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,060
Who the real suspicious person is.

252
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,100
 Certificate of Ownership  
She went out of her way to purchase the apartment that was way too much for her.

253
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,550
Even paying interest on top of repaying the principal in installments.

254
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:39,690
She must have had to fork over tens of millions of won each month to the bank.

255
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:44,650
That's why she received an additional loan from J Financial Group on top of what she owed.

256
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,480
You know, since you worked at a bank,

257
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,220
what happens when such a vicious cycle of paying debt begins.

258
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,850
I heard she asked Seong Hui to buy her place not too long ago.

259
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:59,430
Even after all of that, do you know how she lives these days?

260
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,840
So, your motive for sharing this information with me is

261
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,690
for me to suspect Deputy Head Hwang Ji Hye and not Jeong Su Bin.

262
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,230
My Su Bin has no motive,

263
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:27,490
and there's no evidence that he was threatened by Oh Yu Jin.

264
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,810
You know that

265
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:32,880
the most common motives for murder are usually infatuation, resentment,

266
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,920
or money.

267
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:51,260
I would like the entire amount in cash.

268
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:03,590
- Did you bring your seal? 
- Yes.

269
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,920
Hello. Hello.

270
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,960
Actually, it is strange.

271
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,070
People can change,

272
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,080
but the timing seems a little odd.

273
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:36,500
Song Jeong Ah has her own intentions,

274
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,930
but I don't think it's completely wrong.

275
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,570
But you know,

276
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:45,990
whether Jeong Su Bin or Hwang Ji Hye. If one of them is the culprit,

277
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,440
why did Kang Do Joon protect them?

278
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,160
 mint_choco_banana_girl

279
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,880
 I'm at the headquarters for training.

280
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,650
 But actually, I'm being honored as an outstanding employee.

281
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:58,790
 #WM outstanding financial derivatives salesperson.

282
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,930
 #In front of the lecture hall on the 15th floor.

283
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:03,320
I'm going to the 15th floor.

284
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,120
I can't do that. How can I share the secret of being the number one employee?

285
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,270
- Oh, gosh.
 - Please tell us.

286
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:09,110
Please tell us soon.

287
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:12,450
 Ji Hye, I discussed it with my husband, and we decided to buy it.

288
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,840
 I'll send you the down payment right away.

289
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:35,260
Deputy Head, how come all the VIP tellers were called in today?

290
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:39,300
You know the product that her department announced earlier this year?

291
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,640
The results came out last Friday when sales ended.

292
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,240
Only employees with the best performance by regional headquarters were called to be rewarded.

293
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,170
Do you know Deputy Head Hwang Ji Hye at Shindang Station?

294
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,780
It looked like she came today.

295
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:54,110
Of course! She won first place at Gangseo headquarters.

296
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:57,670
She must have sold about 3 billion won just to private accounts.

297
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,460
It seemed like she invested a few million won herself too.

298
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,510
 Yu Jin's clothes

299
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,140
Shit!

300
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:37,150
What are you going around doing these days?

301
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,700
What about the kids?

302
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:42,240
When all this is over, I'll take them.

303
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,620
The kids need their dad right now!

304
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:48,830
What if they get serious emotional damage from this?

305
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:55,380
And I told my residents that I'd be back in the States after the funeral.

306
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,760
How many weeks has it been?

307
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,900
So, your work comes first now, right?

308
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,190
As someone who is worried about your grandkids,

309
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:04,880
why aren't you worried about your son?

310
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,740
I also feel like I'm going to get serious emotional damage!

311
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,480
 Do Joon!

312
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,020
Dad!

313
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,920
 She must have sold about 3 billion won just to private accounts.

314
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,650
 It seemed like she invested a few million won herself.

315
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,310
 Kang Bong Seok (Yu Jin's father-in-law)

316
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:34,720
Ms. Jang Mi Ho, do you have some time today?

317
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,920
Wear your belt.

318
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,490
I'll give you a call.

319
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:11,220
 No, I'm just trying to find out something. Could you tell me? 
It's at Seoulsi Bannae-gu Seoyeong-dong 485-77 "Brilland."

320
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:16,580
So, I DMed the person who said something about Jeong Su Bin having good luck as a man.

321
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,880
The host bar where Jeong Su Bin worked...

322
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,400
I mean, he let me know where he used to work.

323
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,750
But we can't go there today, right?

324
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,140
Probably not.

325
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,480
Let's go!

326
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,620
I'm hungry.

327
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,300
Let's hurry home and eat.

328
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,180
What are we going to eat?

329
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:49,020
Ha Yool, what do you want to eat?

330
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,010
My ball!

331
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,300
Oh, we're here!

332
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,620
- Let's go!
 - Let's go!

333
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,730
Can I do this?

334
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:31,680
- Let's go inside. 
- Come on, go inside.

335
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,530
We're here again. Here again.

336
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:37,280
We don't have that at home right now.

337
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,510
That's okay. We can go to Jeong Su Bin's old workplace tomorrow.

338
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:17,450
No, we can do that whenever.

339
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:23,670
I feel bad that the kids are being passed around.

340
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:28,040
It's late. You should go home.

341
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:05,640
 Deputy Head Hwang Ji Hye (Sindang Station Branch)

342
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,210
What's going on?

343
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:19,520
What are you doing here?

344
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:24,470
Do I need to explain coming into my own house?

345
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,490
The kids are sleeping!

346
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:30,200
Auntie!

347
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,220
Dad!

348
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,830
Aigoo!

349
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,020
Have you been well, Ji Yool?

350
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,930
- Dad!
 - Ha Yool!

351
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:47,000
Aigoo! My Ha Yool! Have you been well?

352
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,750
- Yes.
 - Did you miss me?

353
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,060
Yes.

354
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:53,740
Ji Yool. Ha Yool. It's Auntie. Open the door.

355
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,090
Auntie can't go inside.

356
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:57,080
No! I want to sleep with Dad!

357
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,250
Auntie, you go!

358
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,540
I'm the kids' dad.

359
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,150
Dad!

360
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:36,470
- Dad!
 - Aigoo! Let's sleep with Dad!

361
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:15,850
 Incorrect pattern

362
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,880
 Let's meet there tomorrow.

363
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,270
 Hurry up and pay.

364
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:43,700
 And take this incident to the grave.

365
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:00,190
 Let's meet there tomorrow...

366
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:13,400
- Did you read it?
- No.

367
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:17,700
What are you answering no to?

368
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,770
Then, what were you asking about?

369
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,670
What are you doing right now?

370
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,920
Our lives are precious to all of us.

371
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,300
We have a lot to protect.

372
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:08,080
Jang Mi Ho, I think that's the same for you.

373
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,520
Are you threatening me right now?

374
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,350
Should I show you what a real threat looks like?

375
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,940
Since the kids are sleeping?

376
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:27,280
Dad.

377
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:30,540
Ji Yool! Ji Yool, did you wake up?

378
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,410
Why did you wake up?

379
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:51,310
 Spam text

380
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,400
 7:00 a.m. Alarm

381
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,100
Did you see her house?

382
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:49,830
Lily's house was here.

383
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,330
No, here.

384
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:56,100
Where is our house?

385
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,900
Where's your dad?

386
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,010
He left earlier.

387
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,420
 DGB Financial Group 
 An accomplice?

388
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:25,630
Oh, geez! You should've called me right away if that happened last night!

389
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:27,990
Lower your voice.

390
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,450
I knew this would happen.

391
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:32,440
I told you last time, didn't I? Whether it's Jeong Su Bin or Hwang Ji Hye,

392
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:36,110
if one of them is the culprit, why did Kang Do Joon protect them?

393
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:38,160
But there didn't need to be another reason.

394
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,250
- Because they're accomplices.
 - That's right!

395
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,780
"Let's meet there tomorrow."

396
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:44,810
"Hurry up and pay" means the payment.

397
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,950
"And take this incident to the grave" is

398
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:49,680
definitely referring to burying Oh Yu Jin's murder.

399
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:52,350
Regardless, I need to confirm with my own eyes.

400
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:56,650
Whether it's Jeong Su Bin or Hwang Ji Hye. Whoever is meeting up with Kang Do Joon.

401
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:58,240
What will you do?

402
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,120
Are you going to follow them or something?

403
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:03,070
That's crazy!

404
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,650
Who?

405
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:15,400
 You're not at work today. Where are you?

406

 Divorce Form (Request for Custody)

407
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:28,020
Yes. Did Jeong Su Bin come out?

408
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,610
No. It's been three hours already.

409
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:33,110
 I wonder if this is all for nothing.

410
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:37,240
- It's Deputy Manager Hwang!
 - What?

411
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,810
Come to the front door. They're both heading that way.

412
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,380
- Where are you?
 - Here!

413
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:31,160
The taxi that the deputy manager is in seems to be turning right.

414
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,790
Wh-What should we do?

415
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:37,290
 The most common motives for murder are usually infatuation, resentment,

416
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:38,510
 or money.

417
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:42,140
 She must have sold about 3 billion won just to private accounts.

418
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,850
 It seemed like she invested a few million won herself.

419
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,270
Turn right.

420
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,140
 Jeong Su Bin, where are you?

421
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,300
 Call me as soon as you see this.

422
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,570
 What are you doing? How come you're not answering your phone?

423
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:13,680
 If you don't call back within the hour, you'll regret it.

What do you mean by the "two of you"?

449
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,060
It was done alone.

450

You see, she's the culprit.

You bastard! Don't lie! I saw everything!

Man, you sure have much to say for someone going to prison soon!

453
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,770
What should we do? Should we spill everything here?

454
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:48,590
Should we?

455
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:52,760
 Excuse me, what's going on in there?

456
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,950
Deputy Manager!

457
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:07,180
Wh-Where are you going? We haven't finished talking yet!

458
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:12,120
Do you want to take all the blame for what happened?

459
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,350
It wasn't me. I really didn't do it!

460
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:16,430
Exactly!

461
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:20,510
Give a statement to the police about what happened that night!

462
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:25,340
I can't say anything!

463
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:30,570
I'm not going to tell you anything. So, please. Leave me out.

464
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:33,800
Please leave me out and look for evidence that points to Kang Do Joon as the culprit!

465
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,000
What are you even saying?

466
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,460
You opened the communal locker, right? B-19?

467
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,980
Actually, Ji Yool's drawing was there originally.

468
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:45,620
That. Find out about that. That's the evidence.

469
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,610
- Got it?
 - Deputy Manager...

470
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:50,660
Let go of her!

471
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:53,730
Deputy Manager!

472
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:58,220
Deputy Manager!

473
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,550
Deputy Manager!

474
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:13,630
 December 20, 2022. 15 days after Oh Yu Jin's death

475
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:21,010
Let's start with 200 million won for now.

476
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:26,340
You didn't report it.

477
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:29,410
Then, you're an accomplice.

478
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:31,380
What are you saying?

479
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:36,130
Did you forget?

480
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:38,550
I have it.

481
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,310
I can give you the money.

482
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:48,610
But I'm not going to go down alone.

483
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:53,170
You'll need to think carefully if you have anything fishy.

484
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:58,050
Shit!

485
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:03,440
All that's left is to ditch this place.

486
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,710
Do you want everything to be exposed?

487
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:09,470
We have to get on the plane, right?

488
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:10,930
Right!

489
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:33,110
 Find Who

490
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,810
Why did you come?

491
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,200
Noona, I'm sorry.

492
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,460
I'm sorry.

493
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:28,300
We don't need this money.

494
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,180
We can make it back again.

495
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,150
I...

496
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:39,240
I must have been crazy.

497
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:43,190
Noona, don't forgive me.

498
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:45,990
Why didn't you just run away with that money?

499
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:50,610
How could I live without you, Noona?

500
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:55,340
Bullshit.

501
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:57,900
You liked Oh Yu Jin, didn't you.

502
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,150
 No matter what you threaten with, I won't kick Su Bin out.

503
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:06,910
Would you be able to say that after hearing what I have to tell you?

504
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:08,980
So, tell me straight up.

505
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:12,470
- What else other than the host bar? 
- I'm not dealing with you.

506
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,030
I'm going to talk to that woman, Jang Mi Ho.

507
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:17,010
You idiot!

508
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:20,500
Do you think Jang Mi Ho has the kind of money you want?

509
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,980
I'll give it to you. So, tell me.

510
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,130
That punk, Jeong Su Bin.

511
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:31,360
He fell for Oh Yu Jin and followed her everywhere.

512
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:34,190
What?

513
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:41,430
 December 3, 2022. Two days before Oh Yu Jin's death

514
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:10,340
 I want to explain my feelings for you again.

515
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:14,980
 I'll wait for you at 8 pm on December 5th. Third floor of underground parking.

516
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:17,320
His love letters were so sincere as well.

517
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:22,540
The day Oh Yu Jin died, he was waiting for her by himself in the underground parking.

518
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,440
You need to wake up, too, Noona.

519
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:43,770
No, it was just...

520
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:47,620
It was something fleeting.

521
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:59,500
Please. D-Don't tell Jeong Ah.

522
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,690
I-I'll do a-anything you ask.

523
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:04,470
A-Anything. S-So, just...

524
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:06,690
J-Just... p-please.

525
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:14,050
Be careful not to get caught.

526
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:38,660
What shall we do going forward?

527
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:40,490
What do you mean?

528
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:43,480
I-I mean... we just...

529
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,750
You must be joking.

530
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:48,540
What would I do with someone like you?

531
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:51,480
Don't make a big deal of a one-time thing.

532
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:56,150
If you weren't Jeong Ah's husband, I wouldn't even have done something like this.

533
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:02,630
Noona, I don't know if you'll believe me.

534
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:04,240
But I...

535
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,690
I wanted to tell you that...

536
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:12,390
the day I waited for Oh Yu Jin...

537
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:20,140
that it was a mistake. That it was all a mistake.

538
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:22,300
I was trying to tell her that.

539
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,000
How can I believe that?

540
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:35,690
It's okay if you don't believe me.

541
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:41,750
Then, do you want to get divorced?

542
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:05,200
Su Bin.

543
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:10,300
I don't really get rid of my people.

544
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,380
 Deputy Head Hwang Ji Hye (Sindang Station Branch)

545
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:48,440
 Deputy Head Hwang Ji Hye (Sindang Station Branch)

546
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:01,050
They both insisted that the other person did it.

547
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:02,950
They were both at the scene of the crime.

548
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:05,260
That means they were connected to Yu Jin's death!

549
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:08,040
Isn't this enough to prosecute them for being accomplices?

550
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,760
Well,

551
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,320
it would be worth talking to Hwang Ji Hye at least.

552
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:15,070
- Thank you.
 - But don't expect too much.

553
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:17,570
The investigation is officially over,

554
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:20,370
and there's a limit to what I can do as an individual.

555
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:23,700
It's all right. That's all I ask.

556
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:28,900
See you tomorrow!

557
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:31,250
- See you!
 - See you!

558
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:33,660
By any chance, did So Won's mother come?

559
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:35,600
No, not yet.

560
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,690
Thank you. Let's go.

561
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:49,070
Ji Yool!

562
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:50,750
So Won!

563
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,380
Why are you backing out now?

564
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:56,360
Me?

565
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,360
You told me to look into the drawing in the communal locker!

566
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,750
You told me that's evidence showing Kang Do Joon as the culprit!

567
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:03,260
I never said that.

568
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:05,020
Are you finished?

569
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:07,910
So Won!

570
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,440
Deputy Manager!

571
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,350
What are you doing right now?

572
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:17,850
Do you want to tear each other apart in front of the kids?

573
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:20,530
Let's go.

574
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,610
Auntie!

575
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:52,630
 You opened the communal locker, right? B-19?

576
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:55,160
 Actually, Ji Yool's drawing was there originally.

577
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:59,000
 That. Find out about that. That's the evidence.

578
00:53:20,370 --> 00:53:22,480
Ji Yool, come here for a minute.

579
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,410
Oh, why?

580
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:26,450
Just for a minute. Really. Just help me with something.

581
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:29,790
About what?

582
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:35,080
By any chance, did you draw this?

583
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:38,060
Yes.

584
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:40,120
Can I ask what you drew here?

585
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,720
Family.

586
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:46,540
Our family.

587
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:52,320
- Ji Yool, why this kind of... 
- Oh, I don't know!

588
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:55,470
Mom said not to draw anything bad.

589
00:53:58,250 --> 00:53:59,830
Family?

590
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:05,790
Did you see Min Seong's drawing this time?

591
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:08,330
- Yes.
 - He drew so well.

592
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:10,460
Maybe we should send him to an art class.

593
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:11,920
Wait a second.

594
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:15,200
Who is it?

595
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,100
Team Leader. 
 Team Leader Park

596
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:18,350
Yes.

597
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:21,030
Yes, sir.

598
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,580
 Divorce Form (Request for Custody)

599
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:46,820
 Divorce Form (Request for Custody)

600
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:05,230
 Oh Yu Jin

601
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:10,730
 Just stay put. I'll find out no matter what.

602
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:12,490
 That bitch's weakness.

603
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:21,530
 Oh Yu Jin

604
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:36,080
 You went around digging up dirt on other people when you have such an appalling secret?

605
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:38,010
 If this is exposed,

606
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:41,170
 you're done for.

607
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,100
 I won't just sit back, either.

608
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:54,040
 The thing you want to protect

609
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:56,540
 you'll have to protect well.

610
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:09,130
 Oh Yu Jin

611
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:24,050
Aren't you washing up?

612
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:26,900
I'm going out for a bit.

613
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,610
Hi! I'm Lily.

614
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:49,790
You're Suzy.

615
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:52,190
Oh, sorry. I'm Suzy.

616
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:53,350
What are you doing?

617
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:56,610
I'm on my way to school. You?

618
00:56:56,610 --> 00:56:58,800
Well, I'm in the middle of drawing.

619
00:57:01,270 --> 00:57:05,370
Our family is just my mom and me. Two of us.

620
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:09,160
Should I put a ribbon on her hair?

621
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:12,040
Yes. A jewel, too.

622
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,730
Do you want to draw, too?

623
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:25,130
How many family members do you have?

624
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:33,420
I can't. Mom said I shouldn't draw.

625
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:37,270
It's okay. Mom is not here.

626
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:39,750
Let's draw together.

627
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:42,010
I'll keep it a secret.

628
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:54,840
Our family has four people.

629
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,920
Mom,

630
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:00,040
Dad, Ji Yool, and Ha Yool.

631
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:31,690
Ji Yool.

632
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:36,560
Ji Yool, your family has four members,

633
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:39,140
but how come you're drawing five people?

634
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:46,270
I can't tell you. It's supposed to be a secret.

635
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:47,750
Who said that?

636
00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:52,050
Mom did.

637
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:03,710
I'll keep your secret. Only tell me.

638
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:32,030
 Oh Yu Jin

639
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:51,080
Mom said.

640
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:54,350
Angel.

641
00:59:54,350 --> 00:59:58,450
She said we have an older sister, too.

642
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:17,790

643
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:24,400
♫  Time to end the night  ♫

644
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:30,280
♫  I don't know where the end is, but wake up anyway  ♫

645
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:33,990
♫  I'll protect myself from the ruins  ♫

646
01:00:33,990 --> 01:00:36,910
♫  Don't be shy, it'll be fine  ♫

647
01:00:36,910 --> 01:00:39,360
♫  Now, take down the walls, get go  ♫

648
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:42,060
♫  Time to end the night  ♫

649
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:45,870
♫  I'll find everything and let go  ♫

650
01:00:45,870 --> 01:00:49,310
♫  The answer is right in front of me  ♫

651
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:52,460
 Battle For Happiness

652
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:54,620
 Your family has four members,

653
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:56,270
 but how come you're drawing five people?

654
01:00:56,270 --> 01:01:00,620
 Mom said we have an older sister, too.

655
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:03,750
 I don't know her.

656
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:05,970
 Please go to the police and tell the truth.

657
01:01:05,970 --> 01:01:07,000
 Are you crazy?

658
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,990
 Detective, you said Yu Jin's cause of death was excessive bleeding, right?

659
01:01:10,990 --> 01:01:14,220
 Could she have lived if 911 was called right away?

660
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:17,050
 There are many times that an eyewitness

661
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:20,940
 becomes an accomplice by not saying what they should say.

662
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:25,250
 You don't know how superficial the title of accomplice is do you?

663
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:28,110
 Do your higher-ups know you're doing this?

664
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,540
 Hey! What are you doing now?

665
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:33,230
 - Here. 
- Let go of me!

666
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:36,270
 I'm giving you this because I think you might need it.

667
01:01:36,270 --> 01:01:38,390
 - Are you Lee Tae Ho? 
- Yes, I am.

668
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:40,410
 You have a delivery.

669
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:42,740
 What's this?

670
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:43,520
 What's going on?

671
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:47,450
 That man. Is he the husband of my birth mom?

672
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:49,830
 Yes.

673
01:01:49,830 --> 01:01:51,840
 Do you know him, by chance?

674
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:57,640
 I won't let you get away with this.

675
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:01,890
 I'll make sure you pay Oh Yu Jin and her children back. So, be prepared.
