 DGB Financial Group 

13
00:00:52,587 --> 00:00:53,617
 Digital Division "List of promotion candidates for the second half of 2022" - Jang Mi Ho: Assistant Manager to Chief of department 

14
00:00:53,617 --> 00:00:56,107
Her work performance has been grade A for three consecutive years,

15
00:00:56,107 --> 00:00:58,897
and she has a very good reputation among the staff.

16
00:01:02,057 --> 00:01:03,837
Why? What's the matter?

17
00:01:07,807 --> 00:01:09,967
 Complaint 

18
00:01:20,117 --> 00:01:22,437
Ms. Jang, where are you right now?

19
00:01:22,437 --> 00:01:25,287
An anonymous letter was sent to the company.

20
00:01:26,537 --> 00:01:29,547
 I'm filing a formal complaint regarding Deputy Jang Mi Ho 

21
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:31,957
 of the Digital Division's SNS marketing team. 

22
00:01:31,957 --> 00:01:35,107
 Jang Mi Ho was step-sibling to victim A from 

23
00:01:35,107 --> 00:01:36,827
 the Bannae-dong murder case. 

24
00:01:36,827 --> 00:01:39,687
 She had an unfortunate incident with her stepfather in high school, 

25
00:01:39,687 --> 00:01:42,407
 and in order to cover up this incident, she threatened A 

26
00:01:42,407 --> 00:01:45,117
 and attempted to push her to commit suicide but failed. 

27
00:01:45,117 --> 00:01:48,687
 Time has passed, but Jang Mi Ho still held a grudge against A, 

28
00:01:48,687 --> 00:01:52,967
 and approached A, reminding her of the past, and psychologically tortured her. 

29
00:01:52,967 --> 00:01:55,777
 Assistant Manager Jang Mi Ho did not stop with hurting 

30
00:01:55,777 --> 00:01:57,707
 many people in A's life, and went as far as to 

31
00:01:57,707 --> 00:02:01,967
 approach A's kids, claiming to care for them. 

32
00:02:01,967 --> 00:02:05,407
 I'm revealing the truth about Assistant Manager Jang Mi Ho to prevent further harm. 

33
00:02:05,407 --> 00:02:10,477
 I sincerely hope Assistant Manager Jang Mi Ho is appropriately punished. 

34
00:02:12,837 --> 00:02:15,047
 - The General Manager is flipping out!  
 - The atmosphere has never been worse. 

35
00:02:15,047 --> 00:02:19,047
 - Gosh, this really tops it all. 
  - I need to get a document signed by General Manager later though. 

36
00:02:22,697 --> 00:02:25,297
 - Daebak, speak of the devil.
   - Whoa.

 Episode 8 

38

This is malicious slander that isn't even confirmed to be true.

39
00:02:43,657 --> 00:02:46,387
The posts on the public forum need to be taken down immediately.

40
00:02:46,387 --> 00:02:49,387
If the company won't protect its employees, how are they supposed to work?

41
00:02:49,387 --> 00:02:53,147
We will be following official protocol after discussions.

42
00:02:53,147 --> 00:02:55,617
The post has a named author attached to it and was submitted officially,

43
00:02:55,617 --> 00:02:57,337
so we can't avoid investigation.

44
00:02:57,337 --> 00:02:59,487
My past?

45
00:02:59,487 --> 00:03:01,857
Or the suspicion of murder?

46
00:03:01,857 --> 00:03:07,057
Let me be clear. Somebody intentionally fabricated my past.

47
00:03:07,057 --> 00:03:12,037
I won't explain my past as that doesn't even suffice as grounds for disciplinary action.

48
00:03:12,037 --> 00:03:15,787
Plus, why should I be investigated by the bank when I'm not a suspect?

49
00:03:15,787 --> 00:03:18,507
Even the police suspended the investigation after clearing the charge.

50
00:03:18,507 --> 00:03:21,387
My understanding is that the police haven't released their investigation results.

51
00:03:21,387 --> 00:03:25,547
Then the company's investigation of me should be made after the official police investigation results are announced.

52
00:03:25,547 --> 00:03:28,807
Until then, please abide by presumption of innocence

53
00:03:29,937 --> 00:03:33,077
I won't ask you to delete the post on the public forum right away, but...

54
00:03:33,077 --> 00:03:36,467
please censor any personally identifying information that points to me.

55
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,127
 They definitely won't tell you who did it. 

56
00:03:43,127 --> 00:03:45,117
 Does anyone come to mind? 

57
00:03:45,117 --> 00:03:48,297
 All right, go ahead and ignore it. 

58
00:03:48,297 --> 00:03:52,827
 Let's see how long you'll last in this neighborhood when everyone 

59
00:03:52,827 --> 00:03:54,537
 turns their back on you.

 The call is not going through. After the beep... 

62
00:04:07,427 --> 00:04:09,227
 The motive for the murder is now clear. 

63
00:04:09,227 --> 00:04:13,117
 Chills. There are all kinds of people at at our bank. 

64
00:04:13,117 --> 00:04:17,377
 Don't run your mouth when you don't know anything. 

65
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:27,657
Why? You two can just have fun with each other.

66
00:04:27,657 --> 00:04:31,227
We want to go to the kids' cafe, too.

67
00:04:31,227 --> 00:04:37,297
Chae Ah, Min Seong, and Eun Han even went to a magic show yesterday.

68
00:04:37,297 --> 00:04:39,847
I want to play with my friends.

69
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:46,027
Should we try calling So Won, then?

70
00:04:46,027 --> 00:04:47,347
Okay!

71
00:04:50,187 --> 00:04:51,687
 Deputy Hwang Ji Hye (Sindang Station Branch) 

72
00:04:58,837 --> 00:05:01,217
 - Hey.  
- Where are you, Ms. Hwang?

73
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:04,427
We're at the playground, and the kids want to play with So Won.

74
00:05:04,427 --> 00:05:06,407
Really?

75
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:09,537
I'm sorry. I'm at the office right now.

76
00:05:09,537 --> 00:05:14,597
Mom, can I cut colored paper with Min Seong?

77
00:05:14,597 --> 00:05:17,207
I'm sorry. I need to hang up.

78
00:05:17,207 --> 00:05:19,277
Let's talk later.

79
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,077
So Won's gone somewhere.

80
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,407
Let's just have fun by ourselves today.

81
00:05:30,407 --> 00:05:32,110
- Where should we go? 
 - Yay!

82
00:05:45,547 --> 00:05:47,997
You told me it's okay to pick up, and this?

83
00:05:47,997 --> 00:05:50,877
You should've had the kids under control.

84
00:05:50,877 --> 00:05:54,507
Why are you taking it out on me? Did you forget what you did?

85
00:05:55,937 --> 00:05:57,527
What did I do?

86
00:05:59,547 --> 00:06:01,947
Don't you understand what's going on?

87
00:06:01,947 --> 00:06:04,507
Jang Mi Ho showed me the texts herself.

88
00:06:04,507 --> 00:06:06,437
 Excuse me, Song Jeong Ah. 

89
00:06:06,437 --> 00:06:08,577
 Why did you send me this? 

90
00:06:09,457 --> 00:06:13,067
 Let's trade. I'll give you what you want. 

91
00:06:13,067 --> 00:06:17,437
 At 11 pm. Don't forget the USB. 

92
00:06:21,967 --> 00:06:23,707
 But where are you going without the kids? 

93
00:06:23,707 --> 00:06:25,507
 I'm going to meet with a detective. 

94
00:06:25,507 --> 00:06:29,867
 I think I found something, and I want to talk to him. 

95
00:06:31,047 --> 00:06:33,827
 You found something? 

96
00:06:37,087 --> 00:06:39,577
 Oh, about Yu Jin? 

97
00:06:45,347 --> 00:06:48,397
 You should go. You have to come back before they go to bed, right? 

98
00:06:48,397 --> 00:06:50,937
 Thank you so much. 

99
00:06:53,657 --> 00:06:55,937
 What are you doing right now? 

100
00:07:02,907 --> 00:07:04,617
 You caught me. 

101

 It's 50 million won. Take the envelope and leave the USB. 

107
00:07:29,997 --> 00:07:34,867
So Won has the same eyes as you when she smiles.

108
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:38,017
I don't think you have anything to worry about.

109
00:07:38,017 --> 00:07:41,537
Anything you do will only get in my way,

110
00:07:41,537 --> 00:07:45,757
so shut up and stay put from now on.

111
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:49,507
You better protect her at all costs, given how you got her.

112
00:07:50,397 --> 00:07:51,947
Fine.

113
00:07:55,947 --> 00:07:58,707
- Bye, get home safe!
 - Bye!

114
00:07:58,707 --> 00:08:00,507
Take care.

115
00:08:28,977 --> 00:08:30,887
Run, hurry.

116
00:08:33,407 --> 00:08:34,877
Wow!

117
00:08:35,987 --> 00:08:37,417
Again!

118
00:08:45,527 --> 00:08:48,747
Auntie. Are you sad about something?

119
00:08:48,747 --> 00:08:50,137
No.

120
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,807
No, I'm not sad.

121
00:08:52,807 --> 00:08:54,807
Mom used to be like that, too.

122
00:08:54,807 --> 00:08:58,367
She would always be staring at the USB.

123
00:08:59,017 --> 00:09:03,017
She wouldn't tell me when I asked her why she was sad.

124
00:09:03,017 --> 00:09:06,317
Are you not going to tell me why you're sad either, Auntie?

125
00:09:06,317 --> 00:09:08,587
No, I'm...

126
00:09:17,677 --> 00:09:19,727
Auntie's...

127
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:24,347
sad that people misunderstand her.

128
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:29,737
There are people who think I did really bad things.

129
00:09:31,287 --> 00:09:33,867
That's not true. Auntie's a good person.

130
00:09:33,867 --> 00:09:37,607
- That's right! The best person in the world. 
 - Really?

131
00:09:37,607 --> 00:09:39,637
- Yeah!
 - This great!

132
00:09:39,637 --> 00:09:41,377
You're this great of a person!

133
00:09:41,377 --> 00:09:44,097
No, look at me. It's this much.

134
00:09:44,097 --> 00:09:45,847
This much! This good!

135
00:09:45,847 --> 00:09:48,797
This much! You're this much of a good person!

136
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,397
This, this much of a good person!

137
00:09:51,397 --> 00:09:52,567
This much!

138
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:55,367
Bigger!

139
00:09:55,367 --> 00:09:58,937
This much of a good person!

140
00:09:59,877 --> 00:10:01,417
How much of a good person?

141
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:03,207
This much!

142
00:10:07,997 --> 00:10:10,287
Let go of my hand, please.

143
00:10:10,287 --> 00:10:12,767
No way.

144
00:10:14,087 --> 00:10:15,707
 Pull the handle 

145
00:10:15,707 --> 00:10:18,067
Let's go in.

146
00:10:21,007 --> 00:10:24,377
 Please be quiet. 

147
00:10:30,077 --> 00:10:31,357
Gosh...

148
00:10:31,357 --> 00:10:34,307
Ha Yool. I told you guys to stop running.

149
00:10:34,307 --> 00:10:36,807
Let's be quiet, okay?

150
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:38,667
Just a second.

151
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:40,787
Ha Yool, stop running.

152
00:10:40,787 --> 00:10:42,737
Who is it?

153
00:10:43,597 --> 00:10:45,277
Do you think I'm a joke?

154
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:48,167
How many times do I need to tell you to be quiet?

155
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:51,267
Sorry. I was trying to tell them to quiet down, but

156
00:10:51,267 --> 00:10:55,017
- I'll try harder. 
- This sucks.

157
00:10:55,017 --> 00:10:58,447
I won't let it go the next time this happens.

158
00:11:01,687 --> 00:11:06,457
 Hello. I've been warning the kids and being careful about noise, 

159
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,487
 but my downstairs neighbor has expressed his grievance multiple times. 

160
00:11:09,487 --> 00:11:14,357
 After looking for a solution, I'm writing hoping that installing mats will improve things. 

161
00:11:14,357 --> 00:11:16,677
 You need to be careful about how you respond to noise complaints.

00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:18,657
 These types of things become newsworthy all the time. 

163
00:11:18,657 --> 00:11:20,647
 It's better to avoid tricky situations. 

164
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:22,787
 Sounds like a good idea to install mats. 

165
00:11:22,787 --> 00:11:26,247
 Apologize to your downstairs neighbor and give them a gift. 

166
00:11:26,247 --> 00:11:28,157
 These things can really escalate. 

167
00:11:28,157 --> 00:11:30,797
 This sucks. 

168
00:11:32,187 --> 00:11:34,577
I've seen him somewhere...

169
00:11:50,457 --> 00:11:51,417
 Inner Spirit Expense Analysis 

170
00:11:51,417 --> 00:11:53,087
 Cash Expenses 

171
00:11:54,327 --> 00:11:56,227
Is this real?

172
00:11:56,227 --> 00:11:59,507
Other than the source transactions looking simple, it doesn't look bad.

173
00:11:59,507 --> 00:12:02,557
 Right? Fixed costs have been high since three years ago, 

174
00:12:02,557 --> 00:12:05,157
 but revenue grew as well, so it hasn't reached a fiscal crisis. 

175
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:08,127
No, there must be something.

176
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:10,167
This has to be it.

177
00:12:11,867 --> 00:12:14,777
 - Is someone at the door?  
- Let me call you back.

178
00:12:34,917 --> 00:12:37,077
What is this?

179
00:12:40,717 --> 00:12:43,157
You crazy bitch! You want a piece of me?

180
00:12:43,157 --> 00:12:45,127
Why are you doing this? The kids aren't even here right now!

181
00:12:45,127 --> 00:12:47,157
How many times do I need to tell you to shut up?

182
00:12:47,157 --> 00:12:48,947
Why don't you get it!

183
00:12:48,947 --> 00:12:50,727
Leave! I'm calling the cops!

184
00:12:50,727 --> 00:12:54,167
Go ahead. Sure, I'll kill you all.

185
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:58,867
Either you move out, or I do. Let's go to the end and see what happens.

186
00:13:20,627 --> 00:13:23,337
 Go ahead. Sure, I'll kill everyone. 

187
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:59,847
Don't worry about Herinity's Night.

188
00:13:59,847 --> 00:14:02,947
When have I let you down?

189
00:14:02,947 --> 00:14:04,507
I'm not worried.

190
00:14:04,507 --> 00:14:07,427
Thanks to you, I've been sleeping well these days.

191
00:14:07,427 --> 00:14:12,337
By the way, how are Ji Yool and Ha Yool?

192
00:14:13,007 --> 00:14:14,297
Yes, sure...

193
00:14:14,297 --> 00:14:19,567
Please remember that your priority should be this kindergarten and the kids.

194
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,967
Not just one kid but all the kids.

195
00:14:25,997 --> 00:14:28,447
It's okay if I check on Min Seong on my way out, right?

196
00:14:28,447 --> 00:14:30,367
Yes, of course.

197
00:14:32,127 --> 00:14:35,467
 I have a wonderful family. 

198
00:14:35,467 --> 00:14:40,417
 I have wonderful family. 

199
00:14:40,417 --> 00:14:45,167
 Good job. I have a wonderful family. 

200
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:51,297
 I have a wonderful family. 

201
00:14:53,577 --> 00:14:56,947
That's strange. The professors downstairs are both mild-mannered.

202
00:14:56,947 --> 00:15:00,287
Not them. Their son.

203
00:15:00,287 --> 00:15:04,117
The noise between floors is a tricky issue.

204
00:15:04,117 --> 00:15:07,137
I'm happy to mediate, but it's ideal

205
00:15:07,137 --> 00:15:08,897
to resolve amongst yourselves.

206
00:15:08,897 --> 00:15:12,277
Have you ever seen the professor's son?

207
00:15:12,277 --> 00:15:14,517
He has short hair, and he's tall and stocky.

208
00:15:14,517 --> 00:15:16,207
He has tattoos on his arms.

209
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:19,217
Is he really their son?

210
00:15:19,217 --> 00:15:21,207
I don't think so...

211
00:15:23,187 --> 00:15:25,057
 Impersonating? 

212
00:15:25,917 --> 00:15:27,917
 Now that I think about it... 

213
00:15:27,917 --> 00:15:31,547
 I guess the wife has a bit of dementia. 

214
00:15:45,637 --> 00:15:46,767
 spirit_ssong 

215
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,667
 Finally moved into the main office. 

216
00:15:57,667 --> 00:16:00,527
 Checked off the materials and lighting from top to bottom. 

217
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:04,457
 This perfectionism of mine will never go away. 

218
00:16:46,177 --> 00:16:48,987
I know who you are.

219
00:16:59,377 --> 00:17:01,527
Song Jeong Ah told you to do this, didn't she?

220
00:17:01,527 --> 00:17:03,757
Why are you here?

221
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:19,387
Jang Mi Ho. Let's join forces. 
 Kim Na Yeong: Let's join forces.   

222
00:17:27,557 --> 00:17:30,167
Join forces?

223
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:34,417
Neither you nor I can go up against Jeong Ah alone.

224
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:36,527
You know, since you've been through it.

225
00:17:37,577 --> 00:17:40,217
If we join forces,

226
00:17:40,217 --> 00:17:44,817
at least you'll be cleared of the accusation that you drove me to attempt suicide

227
00:17:44,817 --> 00:17:46,967
by pinning me as a murderer.

228
00:17:48,887 --> 00:17:51,787
Why are you doing this out of the blue?

229
00:17:54,117 --> 00:17:56,687
I want to...

230
00:17:56,687 --> 00:18:00,757
show her a proper lesson for once.

231
00:18:04,597 --> 00:18:09,317
And, the photos of my husband in the USB.

232
00:18:09,317 --> 00:18:10,927
Hand them over.

233
00:18:12,427 --> 00:18:14,847
Then, I'll help you, too.

234
00:18:19,367 --> 00:18:23,297
- Are you going to Herinity's Night tomorrow? 
 - I should.

235
00:18:23,297 --> 00:18:27,607
You know Jeong Ah won't just let it go, right?

236
00:18:30,237 --> 00:18:35,177
Find someone to have on your side, Jang Mi Ho.

237
00:18:49,367 --> 00:18:51,907
 Herinity Parent's Association Agenda 

238
00:18:53,307 --> 00:18:54,977
 Herinity Parent's Association Agenda 

239
00:18:54,977 --> 00:18:57,827
 Manager Gong Chang Hyeon 

240
00:18:58,507 --> 00:19:00,677
What's going on? You said everything would be fine.

241
00:19:00,677 --> 00:19:02,477
It sounds like she knows you're behind it.

242
00:19:02,477 --> 00:19:04,637
 Song Jeong Ah told you to do this, didn't she? 

243
00:19:04,637 --> 00:19:06,947
 Why are you here? 

244
00:19:06,947 --> 00:19:09,337
What? How?

245
00:19:09,337 --> 00:19:12,297
 How am I supposed to know? 

246
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:17,357
I can't continue after this.

247
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:19,437
Pay me, and let's end it.

248
00:19:19,437 --> 00:19:21,907
I'll pay you two thousand more.

249
00:19:21,907 --> 00:19:24,277
 What more do you want me to do? 

250
00:19:24,277 --> 00:19:26,677
Put those photos in front of her front door right now.

251
00:19:26,677 --> 00:19:29,287
Or set her apartment on fire.

252
00:19:31,027 --> 00:19:33,077
Once is enough.

253
00:19:33,077 --> 00:19:34,377
I won't do any more dangerous stunts.

254
00:19:34,377 --> 00:19:37,177
 You won't even if I set up your own business? 

255
00:19:40,517 --> 00:19:44,947
How much longer are you going to do little gigs for me here and there?

256
00:19:44,947 --> 00:19:48,337
There's a limit to what a friend's sister can do for you.

257
00:19:49,387 --> 00:19:52,757
I'm suggesting we become real business partners.

258
00:20:06,157 --> 00:20:09,857
 Find someone to have on your side, Jang Mi Ho. 

259
00:20:09,857 --> 00:20:12,507
 The almighty Song Jeong Ah is nothing next to Lim Da Eun. 

260
00:20:12,507 --> 00:20:14,507
 I didn't know you were a mom at Herinity! 

261
00:20:14,507 --> 00:20:17,697
 Let's grab lunch sometime. You know my number, right? 

262
00:20:18,897 --> 00:20:22,227
 Lim Da Eun 

263
00:20:26,487 --> 00:20:29,887

 _dlaekdms 

265
00:20:35,997 --> 00:20:39,487
 I love this foodie haven. 

266
00:20:39,487 --> 00:20:41,327
 I'm obsessed these days. 

267
00:20:41,327 --> 00:20:43,827
 It's just a shame that it's floor seating. 

268
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:45,477
 Lim Da Eun - Joon Ha's mom 

269
00:20:47,267 --> 00:20:49,247
 Oh, Mi Ho! 

270
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:51,497
Da Eun, how have you been?

271
00:20:51,497 --> 00:20:56,587
You suggested a meal last time. I'd like to take you out.

272
00:21:10,847 --> 00:21:13,967
That must be why I liked you at first sight.

273
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:20,847
Sometimes, I feel like I don't belong with the moms.

274
00:21:20,847 --> 00:21:23,387
Everyone's much older than me.

275
00:21:23,387 --> 00:21:26,277
I understand. I'm like that, too.

276
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:29,057
Thank you.

277
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:35,607
Gosh, every single thing is to my liking.

278
00:21:39,467 --> 00:21:43,777
Why did you want to see me today?

279
00:21:52,837 --> 00:21:56,237
I was hoping you could help me, Da Eun.

280
00:21:58,127 --> 00:21:59,547
Why me?

281
00:21:59,547 --> 00:22:03,167
You're the only one with that kind of power.

282
00:22:06,307 --> 00:22:09,557
I plan on revealing everything at Herinity's Night.

283
00:22:09,557 --> 00:22:12,797
Please just find out what Song Jeong Ah is scheming there.

284
00:22:12,797 --> 00:22:14,587
Please.

285
00:22:39,767 --> 00:22:42,097
  
 Noona, if you don't wire the money today, 

286
00:22:42,097 --> 00:22:44,297
 my New York college admission will be revoked. 

287
00:22:44,297 --> 00:22:46,007
 Make sure you do it. 

288
00:22:46,777 --> 00:22:48,067
 33,000,000 won 

289
00:22:49,587 --> 00:22:53,087
 Fine. You better study really hard. 

290
00:22:53,087 --> 00:22:56,197
 Who do you want to send to? 

291
00:22:56,197 --> 00:22:57,567
 How much would you like to send? 

292
00:22:57,567 --> 00:23:00,637
 20,000,000 won 

293
00:23:05,437 --> 00:23:06,587
 30,000,000 won has been deposited 

294
00:23:10,457 --> 00:23:12,697
Hey, hey, hey, it's here.

295
00:23:12,697 --> 00:23:14,397
- How much? 
 - How much?

296
00:23:14,397 --> 00:23:16,967
- Thirty million won. 
- Hey, we're good!

297
00:23:16,967 --> 00:23:18,597
All right...

298
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:19,677
 Onion 

299
00:23:21,437 --> 00:23:26,867
 Can I get some ice (crystal meth).  

300
00:23:29,677 --> 00:23:33,257
 Financial Group 

301
00:23:33,257 --> 00:23:34,917
 Please look up Kim Sang Won. 

302
00:23:34,917 --> 00:23:37,827
 Like you said, there has to be at least one Seora High alum at the bank. 

303
00:23:37,827 --> 00:23:41,527
 We should be able to find Kim Sang Won's contact info through the alumni society. 

304
00:23:43,167 --> 00:23:45,157
Jin Seop,

305
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:48,357
- You busy today? 
- Yes. Very.

306
00:23:53,257 --> 00:23:54,847
Hyeongnim!

307
00:23:58,107 --> 00:23:59,467
Hyeongnim.

308
00:24:00,207 --> 00:24:04,077
It's not like finding out where someone went to school is that secretive.

309
00:24:04,077 --> 00:24:06,747
Bankers are all connected through one degree of separation.

310
00:24:06,747 --> 00:24:08,937
It's information you can easily find out by asking around.

311
00:24:08,937 --> 00:24:11,867
Why don't you ask through your degrees of separation, then?

312
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,117
That takes time.

313
00:24:13,117 --> 00:24:17,107
That would take time, Hyeongnim.

314
00:24:17,107 --> 00:24:19,467
Please tell me one employee

315
00:24:19,467 --> 00:24:22,307
who's a Seora High alum. Just one, please. Hyeongnim.

316
00:24:22,307 --> 00:24:24,737
Why do you keep calling me hyeongnim? It's burdensome!

317
00:24:24,737 --> 00:24:27,147
I will attend every Young Frontier regional event from now on.

318
00:24:27,147 --> 00:24:30,067
I'll turn up every time the main branch needs more manpower.

319
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:32,177
Please? Hyeongnim!

320
00:24:35,577 --> 00:24:36,937
 There are just two. 

321
00:24:36,937 --> 00:24:40,597
 One of them is a section chief I know, so it should be fine. 

322
00:24:42,297 --> 00:24:44,157
Aigoo, Hyeongnim! 
  Lee Jeong Hwan 

323
00:24:52,627 --> 00:24:54,267
 CCTV Filming in progress 

324
00:24:54,267 --> 00:24:58,237
It looks like the real thing. He'd never come near here again.

325
00:24:59,887 --> 00:25:02,607
He said he couldn't give out contact info because of privacy issues.

326
00:25:02,607 --> 00:25:04,607
We only found out about Kim Sang Won's workplace

327
00:25:04,607 --> 00:25:08,917
after Jeong Hwan signed up for the alumni group and asked around.

328
00:25:08,917 --> 00:25:10,947
Since when do you call him hyeongnim?

329
00:25:10,947 --> 00:25:13,447
He's been hyeongnim since I saw him blackout drunk.

330
00:25:13,447 --> 00:25:16,127
Kim Sang Won's headed to a construction site in Pyeongtaek tomorrow.

331
00:25:16,127 --> 00:25:17,897
I'll meet him in the afternoon.

332
00:25:17,897 --> 00:25:20,127
I'll take a break and brainstorm tomorrow.

333
00:25:21,007 --> 00:25:22,717
I'd be grateful if you did that.

334
00:25:23,547 --> 00:25:26,437
So, what's all this?

335
00:25:35,357 --> 00:25:39,877
 Bannae-dong couple murder case investigation enters a labyrinth... 

336
00:25:40,987 --> 00:25:44,597
 Challenging to obtain CCTV footage from the day of 

337
00:25:44,597 --> 00:25:47,417
 Bannae-dong couple murder case investigation likely to be prolonged 

338
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:52,197
I only know about Song Jeong Ah's motive.

339
00:25:52,197 --> 00:25:55,447
It's a different question whether she actually did it or not.

340
00:25:55,447 --> 00:25:58,997
 Bannae-dong murder... challenging to obtain CCTV footage from the day of 

341
00:26:00,057 --> 00:26:02,487
 Song Jeong Ah alibi? Check on SNS and with kindergarten moms 

342
00:26:02,487 --> 00:26:04,967
 How to check if Song Jeong Ah's guy was at the apartment then? CCTV? Black box?   

343
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,497
Jeong Ah's alibi?

344
00:28:17,497 --> 00:28:22,037
 Do you remember anything she said off-handedly? 

345
00:28:22,037 --> 00:28:23,697
Not sure.

346
00:28:31,187 --> 00:28:34,547
 Was it the day Yu Jin died? Or the day after? 

347
00:28:36,547 --> 00:28:39,457
She said she was at a family gathering.

348
00:28:39,457 --> 00:28:43,637
 She said she got in late, so she found out about Yu Jin the following day. 

349
00:28:44,907 --> 00:28:48,367
Did the police check Song Jeong Ah's alibi?

350
00:28:48,367 --> 00:28:51,087
The detectives stopped coming after that,

351
00:28:51,087 --> 00:28:52,807
so that must mean they checked.

352
00:28:54,177 --> 00:28:55,157
 spirit_ssong 

353
00:29:00,927 --> 00:29:05,757
Family gathering, but she didn't post about it.

354
00:29:10,877 --> 00:29:12,247
 How to check if Song Jeong Ah's guy was at the apartment then? CCTV? Black box? 

355
00:29:12,247 --> 00:29:17,657
Song Jeong Ah's guy...

356
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,677
I know I saw him.

357
00:29:28,407 --> 00:29:31,967
 Tattoo. That guy also has tattoos... 

358
00:29:33,107 --> 00:29:34,717
Oh, just a moment.

359
00:29:34,717 --> 00:29:39,277
 The guy in the black hat on the elevator the day Yu Jin died? 

360
00:29:49,117 --> 00:29:52,317
 Yu Jin didn't pick up her phone. 

361
00:29:53,127 --> 00:29:56,107
 When I got out of the taxi and walked toward the apartment building, 

362
00:29:56,107 --> 00:30:00,257
 I remember the guy walking in front was also wearing a black hat. 

363
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:01,817
 Taxi? 

364
00:30:02,647 --> 00:30:04,527
 The black box of the taxi. 

365
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:10,257

 Customer Call Center 

367
00:30:11,737 --> 00:30:13,207
 Call 

368
00:30:14,507 --> 00:30:18,717
I would like to speak with the driver of the car numbered 21JA4850.

369
00:30:23,297 --> 00:30:24,347
When did you say it was?

370
00:30:24,347 --> 00:30:27,157
Starting from 8:40 pm. on the fifth.

371
00:30:45,027 --> 00:30:46,467
I found it.

372
00:30:46,467 --> 00:30:50,287
What? I met with Kim Sang Won!

373
00:30:50,287 --> 00:30:53,637
But I think you better make your way over here.
  Kim Sang Won 

374
00:30:53,637 --> 00:30:56,687
Yes. Pull the right and the left, too.

375
00:30:56,687 --> 00:30:58,987
Make sure the center doesn't droop. 
 The 9th Herinity's Night 

376
00:30:58,987 --> 00:31:00,807
Left, too.

377
00:31:00,807 --> 00:31:02,497
Great.
 The 9th Herinity's Night 

378
00:31:03,397 --> 00:31:06,497
Manager, excuse me for a moment.

379
00:31:10,397 --> 00:31:12,037
Please check in with me again.

380
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:13,297
Yes ma'am.

381
00:31:19,807 --> 00:31:21,937
You're working so hard.

382
00:31:24,137 --> 00:31:25,227
This is for encouragement.

383
00:31:25,227 --> 00:31:27,917
- Thank—
 - Have some snacks!

384
00:31:30,237 --> 00:31:32,417
Not bad.

385
00:31:32,977 --> 00:31:36,997
The neighborhood is tumultuous these days.

386
00:31:36,997 --> 00:31:39,877
Looks like you're cooking up something fun.

387
00:31:39,877 --> 00:31:43,977
You must have a lot of time and a lot of interest.

388
00:31:43,977 --> 00:31:46,417
I'm not a fan of noise.

389
00:31:48,017 --> 00:31:52,127
You'll be able to take responsibility for everything you're doing, right?

390
00:31:52,127 --> 00:31:54,707
- What do you--
 - Great seeing everything.

391
00:31:54,707 --> 00:31:57,467
You worked so hard to get things ready.

392
00:31:57,467 --> 00:31:59,457
See you later.

393
00:31:59,457 --> 00:32:02,907
I'm really looking forward to today's gathering.

394
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:20,117
 The 9th Herinity's Night Herinity Parents Association Agenda
 The 9th Herinity's Night 

395
00:32:30,917 --> 00:32:32,327
It's me.

396
00:32:33,207 --> 00:32:35,477
Things are just getting interesting.

397
00:32:40,717 --> 00:32:43,967
 The 9th Herinity's Night The 9th Herinity's Night
 The 9th Herinity's Night 

398
00:32:46,127 --> 00:32:49,147
- You made it.
 - Hello.

399
00:32:49,147 --> 00:32:50,337
Oh, Ju Hyeok.

400
00:32:50,337 --> 00:32:52,097
Hello.

401
00:32:53,837 --> 00:32:55,787
Nice to see you.

402
00:32:57,397 --> 00:32:59,187
Oh, CEO.

403
00:33:00,007 --> 00:33:02,017
I'm Song Jeong Ah.

404
00:33:06,297 --> 00:33:08,227
I hope you have a good time.

405
00:33:08,227 --> 00:33:09,387
Chairman.

406
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:11,237
- Hello, CEO.
 - You came together.

407
00:33:11,237 --> 00:33:12,547
Yes.

408
00:33:23,857 --> 00:33:27,787
 Five core influences behind future geniuses are 

409
00:33:27,787 --> 00:33:31,667
 collaboration, communication, sensibility, creativity, 

410
00:33:31,667 --> 00:33:34,817
 and confidence. As the times are changing... 

411
00:33:34,817 --> 00:33:38,767
Gosh, I don't think we'll even make it by 7:30.

412
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,877
Just let me out here.

413
00:33:40,877 --> 00:33:42,087
Huh?

414
00:33:46,757 --> 00:33:49,567
Think about how you might prepare,

415
00:33:49,567 --> 00:33:54,307
but don't be too anxious about whether your kid is behind.

416
00:33:54,307 --> 00:33:59,437
Don't forget all of you here are already good parents.

417
00:34:06,617 --> 00:34:08,147
 The call is not going through... 

418
00:34:08,147 --> 00:34:10,157
 Jang Mi Ho 

419
00:34:13,137 --> 00:34:19,927
Let's give it up to Dr. Choi Moon Kyeong for her amazing lecture.

420
00:34:19,927 --> 00:34:21,927
We'll take a thirty-minute break now,

421
00:34:21,927 --> 00:34:25,427
then, we will discuss the agenda set by

422
00:34:25,427 --> 00:34:28,377
the Herinity Parents Association.

423
00:34:32,267 --> 00:34:34,607
Did I drink too much?

424
00:34:34,607 --> 00:34:36,737
Not as much as me.

425
00:34:36,737 --> 00:34:38,867
What's the point of an investment presentation?

426
00:34:38,867 --> 00:34:42,327
I wonder if my husband knows this is real business.

427
00:34:42,327 --> 00:34:47,457
Are you thinking of bringing up that agenda item?

428
00:34:47,457 --> 00:34:50,927
Of course. Why do you think I set this up?

429
00:34:50,927 --> 00:34:53,297
I just feel weird about it.

430
00:34:53,297 --> 00:34:56,007
I wonder if Lim Da Eun's going to just stay put.

431
00:34:56,007 --> 00:34:59,497
Social influence is as powerful as monetary contributions.

432
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:01,367
What is she going to do?

433
00:35:01,367 --> 00:35:05,007
She doesn't live at our apartment building, and her kid already graduated.

434
00:35:05,007 --> 00:35:09,197
That rude bitch only knows how to act entitled.

435
00:35:09,197 --> 00:35:11,547
Don't worry about it. Let's go.

436
00:35:12,417 --> 00:35:16,187
As I mentioned, we will now discuss agenda items

437
00:35:16,187 --> 00:35:20,327
set by the Parents Association.

438
00:35:24,347 --> 00:35:26,177
 Herinity Parents Association Agenda 

439
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:31,237
 Kindergarten Accidents and Incidents 

440
00:35:31,237 --> 00:35:35,997
Child abuse. Verbal and physical assault. Even sexual harassment.

441
00:35:35,997 --> 00:35:38,937
These don't only happen in other people's kindergartens.

442
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:45,387
As you know, similar unfortunate incidents took place at Herinity recently.

443
00:35:45,387 --> 00:35:48,517
You all must have been displeased that

444
00:35:48,517 --> 00:35:51,737
the Herinity name was repeatedly mentioned in this context.

445
00:35:51,737 --> 00:35:55,627
It's an undeniable fact that the nation's finest community

446
00:35:55,627 --> 00:36:00,577
that is Herinity, was severely disgraced.

447
00:36:00,577 --> 00:36:03,177
So, what should we do now?

448
00:36:03,177 --> 00:36:07,377
Don't you think there should be preemptive measures to prevent such things?

449
00:36:07,377 --> 00:36:11,047
Therefore, as the chair of the Parents Association,

450
00:36:11,047 --> 00:36:15,337
I officially propose that regulations regarding the expulsion of children

451
00:36:15,337 --> 00:36:18,137
at the kindergarten be added to the rules.

452
00:36:20,407 --> 00:36:22,247
If no one objects to the regulation—

453
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:24,187
I have an objection.

454
00:36:28,517 --> 00:36:29,637
Please go ahead.

455
00:36:29,637 --> 00:36:31,967
Aren't the standards too vague?

456
00:36:31,967 --> 00:36:34,847
Expulsion is the highest level of action,

457
00:36:34,847 --> 00:36:37,747
and it's a cruel measure for the expelled child.

458
00:36:37,747 --> 00:36:41,007
Shouldn't there be more clear-cut standards?

459
00:36:41,007 --> 00:36:44,277
Of course. However, the more detailed the stipulation is,

460
00:36:44,277 --> 00:36:47,057
the larger the loopholes are.

461
00:36:47,057 --> 00:36:50,037
If you mention specific examples in the regulation

462
00:36:50,037 --> 00:36:52,597
and something that doesn't apply to that happens,

463
00:36:52,597 --> 00:36:54,747
the regulation cannot be activated.

464
00:36:54,747 --> 00:36:59,257
Also, it's not like we can account for every possible course of action.

465
00:36:59,257 --> 00:37:00,947
So, who gets to determine

466
00:37:00,947 --> 00:37:04,317
whether a child is expelled based on these vague regulations?

467
00:37:04,317 --> 00:37:06,967
That's why the Parents Association exists.

468
00:37:06,967 --> 00:37:09,897
So, based on the subjective judgment of the Parents Association?

469
00:37:09,897 --> 00:37:15,937
That judgment will not go beyond the boundaries of conventional logic.

470
00:37:15,937 --> 00:37:19,317
Since the association is comprised of many, there will not be bias, either.

471
00:37:19,317 --> 00:37:20,697
I'm not so sure.

472
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:24,207
If there is a biased authority within the Parents Association,

473
00:37:24,207 --> 00:37:26,117
that would be a different story.

474
00:37:26,117 --> 00:37:30,997
Such hypotheticals are not necessary to debate here.

475
00:37:35,247 --> 00:37:40,127
Then, could you give a specific example of what constitutes a disgraceful act

476
00:37:40,127 --> 00:37:41,897
toward the Herinity Kindergarten?

477
00:37:41,897 --> 00:37:43,307
Of course.

478
00:37:43,307 --> 00:37:46,917
Fortunately, a suitable example recently took place.

479
00:37:46,917 --> 00:37:50,667
 A parent, or a person who acts as one, 

480
00:37:50,667 --> 00:37:54,467
 who has a track record of crime. 

481
00:37:54,467 --> 00:37:57,727
A situation where someone accused a parent of being a murderer,

482
00:37:57,727 --> 00:38:03,267
causing serious mental harm and disturbance in the community.

483
00:38:25,237 --> 00:38:27,217
What do we do?

484
00:38:27,217 --> 00:38:29,747
Sounds like you gave the wrong example.

485
00:38:32,697 --> 00:38:36,477
So many fun things happened while I was at the hospital.

486
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:42,267
What an absurd rumor when I'm here, living my life well.

487
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:48,497
Everyone, please focus over here.

488
00:38:48,497 --> 00:38:52,477
A rumor born out of a petty misunderstanding is a secondary issue.

489
00:38:52,477 --> 00:38:55,857
What seriously disgraced Herinity

490
00:38:55,857 --> 00:39:01,047
is the criminal record of a parental figure.

491
00:39:02,237 --> 00:39:03,917
I don't know.

492
00:39:03,917 --> 00:39:07,327
I would say the person who manipulated said track record

493
00:39:07,327 --> 00:39:11,187
disgraced Herinity more seriously.

494
00:39:22,847 --> 00:39:25,267
May I speak?

495
00:39:26,827 --> 00:39:29,177
This is a space for discussing new agenda items,

496
00:39:29,177 --> 00:39:31,907
not a space for defending your personal issues.

497
00:39:31,907 --> 00:39:34,477
As I've warned several times,

498
00:39:34,477 --> 00:39:39,727
I have obtained all evidence that false information was spread about my past.

499
00:39:39,727 --> 00:39:43,447
You'll know who you are when you're served papers.

500
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:48,457
I thought you should know that the story of my past

501
00:39:48,457 --> 00:39:50,397
has been severely manipulated.

502
00:39:50,397 --> 00:39:52,827
What do you mean, manipulated?

503
00:39:52,827 --> 00:39:56,847
I only passed on what I heard from your high school classmate, Kim Sang Won.

504
00:39:56,847 --> 00:40:00,357
You've never met Kim Sang Won in person, have you?

505
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:05,277
I met with him.

506
00:40:10,167 --> 00:40:11,437
This is not my SNS.

507
00:40:11,437 --> 00:40:13,497
 This is not my SNS. 

508
00:40:13,497 --> 00:40:15,977
 I've never posted anything like this. 

509
00:40:15,977 --> 00:40:18,427
 Looks like I was hacked. 

510
00:40:18,427 --> 00:40:21,187
 - You're sure?
 - I'm sure. 

511
00:40:29,987 --> 00:40:34,107
Kim Sang Won's SNS. You created that, didn't you?

512
00:40:34,887 --> 00:40:37,007
Commenters claiming they're my classmates.

513
00:40:37,007 --> 00:40:40,817
Those are also accounts you manage, right?

514
00:40:41,947 --> 00:40:47,167
Plus, you hired a guy to threaten me, didn't you?

515
00:40:52,667 --> 00:40:55,467
- Evidence.
 - Yes, I have it.

516
00:41:14,207 --> 00:41:18,647
You know better than anyone who this person is.

517
00:41:20,367 --> 00:41:22,967
Aren't you all curious at this point

518
00:41:22,967 --> 00:41:27,327
why Song Jeong Ah is so eager to push me out?

519
00:41:27,897 --> 00:41:30,527
Even going this far to do so.

520
00:41:32,307 --> 00:41:34,407
Today,

521
00:41:34,407 --> 00:41:39,117
I would like to hear an honest response to that question.

522
00:41:59,847 --> 00:42:01,767
This was why?

523
00:42:06,517 --> 00:42:09,757
You think it's that easy to kill a person?

524
00:42:10,417 --> 00:42:13,307
Since we're here, let me be frank.

525
00:42:13,307 --> 00:42:16,767
I'm so thankful Oh Yu Jin died,

526
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:19,217
but I have nothing to do with it.

527
00:42:19,217 --> 00:42:21,807
The day Yu Jin died,

528
00:42:21,807 --> 00:42:23,437
at the exact time the incid,ent took place

529
00:42:23,437 --> 00:42:27,677
I saw a strange man enter building 151.

530
00:42:28,557 --> 00:42:31,447
He had a tattoo on his wrist.

531
00:42:31,447 --> 00:42:37,597
The guy who came to complain to me about noise had the same tattoo.

532
00:42:38,247 --> 00:42:41,767
This guy. You hired him, didn't you?

533
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,987
Seeing that he helped you with the move of your company,

534
00:42:45,987 --> 00:42:50,617
I imagine he's a previous employee or someone pretty close to you.

535
00:42:50,617 --> 00:42:52,297
You're right.

536
00:42:52,297 --> 00:42:55,307
He takes care of personal things for me.

537
00:42:55,307 --> 00:42:56,677
And so?

538
00:42:56,677 --> 00:43:00,047
He has nothing to do with Oh Yu Jin's death.

539
00:43:00,047 --> 00:43:03,567
I called him to my house for a personal matter that day.

540
00:43:03,567 --> 00:43:05,207
You're lying again.

541
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:07,477
You said you had a family gathering that day.

542
00:43:07,477 --> 00:43:10,737
I heard that's what you testified to the police. Isn't that true?

543
00:43:11,377 --> 00:43:16,357
Why would he come to building 151 when you weren't home?

544
00:43:18,177 --> 00:43:21,127
Were you really at a family gathering that day?

545
00:43:21,127 --> 00:43:23,877
What were you doing that day?

546
00:43:23,877 --> 00:43:25,627
Why are you acting crazy when

547
00:43:25,627 --> 00:43:28,067
even the detectives have moved on?

548
00:43:28,067 --> 00:43:29,887
Do you have evidence that she died because of me?

549
00:43:29,887 --> 00:43:31,717
Even if you didn't kill her,

550
00:43:31,717 --> 00:43:34,847
it sounds like you think you're the cause of her death.

551
00:43:43,367 --> 00:43:46,207
Don't think it's over.

552
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:51,107
I will find out what you've done.

553
00:44:02,797 --> 00:44:04,427
You went through a lot.

554
00:44:04,427 --> 00:44:08,757
This must be what they mean when they say you reap what you sow.

555
00:44:08,757 --> 00:44:10,557
I hope the culture of criticism and insult

556
00:44:10,557 --> 00:44:14,857
disappears from the Herinity community from this point forward.

557
00:44:16,527 --> 00:44:20,557
Where were you? I was looking for you.

558
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:24,937
Mi Ho. Won't you join Trinity 99?

559
00:44:24,937 --> 00:44:27,097
I'll recommend you.

560
00:44:27,097 --> 00:44:29,607
Isn't that too extreme?

561
00:44:29,607 --> 00:44:31,777
Well, I...

562
00:44:38,667 --> 00:44:40,177
Sounds good.

563
00:44:40,977 --> 00:44:43,107
There's no reason to say no.

564
00:45:18,917 --> 00:45:20,687
Eonni.

565
00:45:23,877 --> 00:45:25,697
Let's leave.

566
00:45:25,697 --> 00:45:28,357
I think it's all over now.

567
00:45:29,557 --> 00:45:31,187
Over?

568
00:45:35,297 --> 00:45:37,627
What's over?

569
00:45:39,667 --> 00:45:41,897
It's just beginning again.

570
00:46:03,197 --> 00:46:05,897
 My Minion Su Bin ♥ 

571
00:46:10,077 --> 00:46:11,217
Yes, Su Bin.

572
00:46:11,217 --> 00:46:13,177
 You're still not done? 

573
00:46:13,177 --> 00:46:15,187
 I came home, and you weren't here. 

574
00:46:15,187 --> 00:46:17,247
I'm still wrapping up.

575
00:46:17,247 --> 00:46:19,117
I'll be home soon.

576
00:46:19,727 --> 00:46:22,387
Why? Do you have something to tell me?

577
00:46:22,387 --> 00:46:24,337
 I might be worried for nothing, 

578
00:46:24,337 --> 00:46:27,117
 but I can't get a hold of your younger brother. 

579
00:46:29,417 --> 00:46:30,757
Since when?

580
00:46:30,757 --> 00:46:32,887
 I sent him a text before lunch 

581
00:46:32,887 --> 00:46:35,447
 but he hasn't read it yet. 

582
00:46:35,987 --> 00:46:39,387
Wait a moment. I'll try contacting him.

583
00:46:39,387 --> 00:46:41,597
 Baby Bro 

584
00:46:47,527 --> 00:46:50,427
 The call is not going through. After the beep... 

585
00:46:57,307 --> 00:46:59,097
Got it.

586
00:46:59,097 --> 00:47:01,007
What's going on? What about Jeong Won and Jeong Pil?

587
00:47:01,007 --> 00:47:03,807
Nothing. He's not picking up your call, either?

588
00:47:06,057 --> 00:47:08,217
Where are you going?

589
00:47:50,007 --> 00:47:52,987
 The call is not going through. After the beep... 

590
00:47:52,987 --> 00:47:56,367
What do we do? There's nowhere else to check.

591
00:47:56,997 --> 00:47:58,477
It couldn't be that again—

592
00:47:58,477 --> 00:48:00,807
Don't even say that.

593
00:48:00,807 --> 00:48:03,067
He couldn't have done that again.

594
00:48:06,737 --> 00:48:08,057
Yes?

595
00:48:09,057 --> 00:48:09,877
Hello?

596
00:48:09,877 --> 00:48:12,317
 Noona, i-it's me... 

597
00:48:12,317 --> 00:48:14,047
Hey, Song Jeon—

598
00:48:14,627 --> 00:48:15,917
Where are you right now?

599
00:48:15,917 --> 00:48:18,957
 Please help me. Please? 

600
00:48:30,227 --> 00:48:32,407
 Grande Motel 

601
00:48:47,117 --> 00:48:48,977
You son of a bitch.

602
00:48:56,517 --> 00:48:59,917
Where else are you hurt?

603
00:49:00,667 --> 00:49:02,397
Nowhere.

604
00:49:10,907 --> 00:49:15,107
Did you do drugs or not?

605
00:49:18,517 --> 00:49:20,017
Answer me

606
00:49:20,017 --> 00:49:24,767
so I can begin to clean up your mess.

607
00:49:27,417 --> 00:49:28,997
I did.

608
00:49:35,177 --> 00:49:36,347
What about the car?

609
00:49:36,347 --> 00:49:38,407
It's still there.

610
00:49:38,407 --> 00:49:40,847
But I took the black box out and brought it with me.

611
00:49:50,717 --> 00:49:52,757
Jeong Sik.

612
00:49:54,727 --> 00:49:59,867
We'll all go down if you get caught. Not just you.

613
00:49:59,867 --> 00:50:04,487
It won't just end with you getting locked up!

614
00:50:04,487 --> 00:50:09,177
Do you even know how critical owner risk is

615
00:50:09,177 --> 00:50:11,012
in our business?

616
00:50:11,012 --> 00:50:12,947
After...

617
00:50:12,947 --> 00:50:16,737
after everything I did for you...

618
00:50:18,317 --> 00:50:20,217
Jeong Sik.

619
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:22,097
I'm sorry, Noona.

620
00:50:23,227 --> 00:50:25,067
I'm sorry...

621
00:50:31,457 --> 00:50:33,857
Stay put until I contact you again.

622
00:50:33,857 --> 00:50:35,837
- You, too.
 - M-Me?

623
00:50:35,837 --> 00:50:39,467
I'll contact you through Su Bin's phone, so keep your phone off.

624
00:50:39,467 --> 00:50:42,177
H-How long should I stay here?

625
00:50:42,177 --> 00:50:44,867
What about you? What will you do?

626
00:50:44,867 --> 00:50:47,187
You have no use for that information.

627
00:50:49,407 --> 00:50:52,047
Just stay put here like you're dead.

628
00:51:07,687 --> 00:51:11,257
Hello? I'm making a vehicle theft report.

629
00:51:16,337 --> 00:51:18,497
I have something to show you.

630
00:51:39,687 --> 00:51:41,357
You didn't have to do this.

631
00:51:41,357 --> 00:51:43,397
You'll regret it.

632
00:51:55,567 --> 00:52:00,517
 You go wild if you drink this at the same time. 

633
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:02,907
 Sell lots of it! 

634
00:52:02,907 --> 00:52:06,137
 Spirit! 

635
00:52:15,597 --> 00:52:17,317
What do you want?

636
00:52:17,317 --> 00:52:20,207
Don't make a sound and stay quiet.

637
00:52:20,207 --> 00:52:25,257
Don't rally the moms by spreading weird rumors about me.

638
00:52:28,897 --> 00:52:32,207
I'll take this to mean that you and I are on the same page then.

639
00:52:55,227 --> 00:52:58,507
Why did they leave so early?

640
00:53:22,077 --> 00:53:25,037
I wasn't able to unlock the password.

641
00:53:25,037 --> 00:53:28,907
I'll hand over the photos once I get in.

642
00:53:32,247 --> 00:53:35,147
What did you talk about with Jeong Ah in the bathroom?

643
00:53:39,317 --> 00:53:43,387
I've been thinking a lot.

644
00:53:44,437 --> 00:53:46,357
What do you think?

645
00:53:48,737 --> 00:53:50,497
It can't be.

646
00:53:51,237 --> 00:53:55,317
Jeong Ah wants to win against the other person when she fights.

647
00:53:55,317 --> 00:53:58,257
She doesn't want the other person to die.

648
00:54:01,007 --> 00:54:05,837
Wanting to kill and actually killing someone are two very different things.

649
00:54:08,847 --> 00:54:10,967
I also hated

650
00:54:11,827 --> 00:54:14,797
Yu Jin to death.

651
00:54:27,167 --> 00:54:30,287
You know we were in a happiness battle, right?

652
00:54:32,027 --> 00:54:33,697
Do you know...

653
00:54:35,627 --> 00:54:38,487
how you win that battle?

654
00:54:42,667 --> 00:54:45,477
You don't need to get happier.

655
00:54:45,477 --> 00:54:48,427
You can just shatter someone else's happiness.

656
00:54:53,717 --> 00:54:58,597
I bet she dropped a droplet of ink into the water.

657
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:03,017
That's how casting suspicion works.

658
00:55:07,647 --> 00:55:10,017
Then, what about you, Na Yeong?

659
00:55:10,917 --> 00:55:13,587
What did you want to happen to Yu Jin?

660
00:55:18,377 --> 00:55:20,497
I wanted at least...

661
00:55:21,327 --> 00:55:26,387
one unlucky thing to happen to her.

662
00:55:28,057 --> 00:55:29,977
I didn't want her to die,

663
00:55:32,407 --> 00:55:34,137
Because I wanted...

664
00:55:35,007 --> 00:55:37,237
to share the unhappiness.

665
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:12,880
 Message from 32nd cohort group chat: 
 Wow, I guess I'll have to look it up too.   

666
00:56:16,617 --> 00:56:18,667
 "It's not a third-party crime." Bannae-dong couple murder case enters a new chapter. 

667
00:56:38,107 --> 00:56:40,037
Assistant Manager.

668
00:56:40,037 --> 00:56:41,517
Who's this?

669
00:56:42,517 --> 00:56:45,957
That's not important right now.

670
00:56:57,287 --> 00:56:59,327
- Detective.
 - Jang Mi Ho.

671
00:56:59,327 --> 00:57:02,017
You need to come with us to the station right now.

672
00:57:03,017 --> 00:57:06,167
Excuse me? About what?

673
00:57:06,167 --> 00:57:10,687
You need to accompany me on suspicion of instigating murder of Kang Do Joon.

674
00:57:13,137 --> 00:57:16,077
Instigating murder? Me?

675
00:57:16,077 --> 00:57:18,067
 That's when I knew. 

676
00:57:23,517 --> 00:57:26,687
The two of them were conspiring to kill me.

677

♫  Something's wrong, wake me up from my blindfolded eyes  ♫

678
00:57:34,107 --> 00:57:40,727
♫  It's over, I can't hide anymore  ♫

679
00:57:40,727 --> 00:57:46,767
♫  The crooked trust, the hidden anxiety  ♫

♫  My twisted memory from feeding on them  ♫

 Battle For Happiness 

685
00:58:11,637 --> 00:58:15,537
 Jang Mi Ho, you were seen on CCTV accepting money! 

686
00:58:15,537 --> 00:58:19,387
 If two people were sharing a space and if one of them died, 

687
00:58:19,387 --> 00:58:22,587
 isn't the other person the most likely suspect? 

688
00:58:23,547 --> 00:58:26,517
 The kids' grandfather picked them up as soon as school was out. 

689
00:58:26,517 --> 00:58:29,077
 Didn't he call you? 

690
00:58:32,287 --> 00:58:35,507
 Could it be that Song Jeong Ah found the weak spot by hiring help 

691
00:58:35,507 --> 00:58:37,517
 and threatened Yu Jin with it? 

692
00:58:37,517 --> 00:58:40,637
 That weak spot could be related to Kang Do Joon. 

693
00:58:41,657 --> 00:58:43,757
 I won't let you off. 

694
00:58:43,757 --> 00:58:49,187
 I will make you pay for what you did. 

695
00:58:49,187 --> 00:58:50,477
Delete everything? Confirm  

696
00:58:51,177 --> 00:58:53,177
 There's a place Yu Jin might have shared this. 

697
00:58:53,177 --> 00:58:54,267
 Where? 

698
00:58:54,267 --> 00:58:58,117
 If Yu Jin had a huge, unspeakable secret, 

699
00:58:58,117 --> 00:59:01,427
 she would have shared it there, not with us. 

700
00:59:01,427 --> 00:59:04,727
♫  My twisted memory  ♫

701
00:59:04,727 --> 00:59:10,757
♫  Buried scars eventually choke us  ♫

702
00:59:10,757 --> 00:59:14,508
♫  Never leave behind again  ♫
