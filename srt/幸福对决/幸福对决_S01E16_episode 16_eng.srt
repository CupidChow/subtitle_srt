 Battle For Happiness

10
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,910
 This is a work of fiction. Characters, locations, agencies, incidents, organizations, and jobs have no connections to real life.

11
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,480
 The filming of child actors was conducted safely with consultation from experts and with their guardian's consent.

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,150

Seeing how I can't find it even though I've looked everywhere like this,

13
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,280
 it means she may have gotten rid of it.

14
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,447
 Then is there anyone else who might know about the USB apart from Hwang Ji Hye?

15
00:00:56,447 --> 00:00:57,827
 Someone else may have seen it.

16
00:00:57,827 --> 00:01:00,897
 Didn't Mommy have a black USB?

17
00:01:00,897 --> 00:01:04,797
 I saw it was in the master bedroom drawers.

18
00:01:04,797 --> 00:01:08,447
 Was there really a black USB in the master bedroom drawers?

19
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:18,070

20
00:01:25,147 --> 00:01:28,267
 The deal involving Kang Do Joon is set.

21
00:01:28,267 --> 00:01:31,557
 I won't do it. I don't want it.

22
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:34,527
 I don't want it, no.

23
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:36,827
 What is the reason you're playing this for me?

24
00:01:36,827 --> 00:01:38,887
 Why don't you kill her for me then?

 Gangnam

28
00:03:15,097 --> 00:03:16,257
What is wrong with this?

29
00:03:16,257 --> 00:03:17,507
Wh-What's wrong?

30
00:03:17,507 --> 00:03:19,957
What do we do? The signal disappeared!

31
00:03:19,957 --> 00:03:21,317
Gosh, this is driving me nuts!

32
00:03:21,317 --> 00:03:22,737
Forget it.

33
00:03:22,737 --> 00:03:25,157
I think I know where he's going.

34
00:03:34,217 --> 00:03:35,937
I asked what this is.

35
00:03:35,937 --> 00:03:37,647
Answer me!

36
00:03:38,597 --> 00:03:41,687
I don't know. It was attached to the car.

37
00:04:58,297 --> 00:05:01,317
 Detective, come to the underground parking lot in the apartment building-

38
00:05:08,597 --> 00:05:10,117
 Have you arrived?

39
00:05:10,117 --> 00:05:13,427
 You remember we're supposed to go to the clinic together in my car, right?

40
00:05:13,427 --> 00:05:17,597
 I turned off all the CCTVs for the building and the clinic, so don't worry.

41
00:05:18,957 --> 00:05:22,027
 Kang Do Joon

42
00:05:22,027 --> 00:05:23,417
 I am in the parking lot.

43
00:05:23,417 --> 00:05:26,217
 But I didn't know it was possible to get an appointment on the day of.

44
00:05:26,217 --> 00:05:27,827
 Please give me a lot of the medication today.

45
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,317
 I haven't been able to sleep well recently.

46
00:05:31,827 --> 00:05:33,257
 I woke up.

47
00:05:33,257 --> 00:05:36,337
 It's not enough. Please give me 10 ml more.

48
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:38,527
 I can't do that. It's too dangerous.

49
00:05:38,527 --> 00:05:41,637
 If you don't give it to me, I'll report you to the police right now!

50
00:06:33,297 --> 00:06:35,487
Don't look at me like that.

51
00:06:35,487 --> 00:06:37,957
As if you're looking at a piece of trash.

52
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,227
It's not just anyone.

53
00:06:43,227 --> 00:06:46,997
It pisses me off to see you looking at me like that.

54
00:06:46,997 --> 00:06:50,477
Jang Mi Ho, you're not that much different from me.

55
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:54,267
I thought we were very similar.

56
00:06:55,197 --> 00:06:57,887
No way.

57
00:06:57,887 --> 00:07:00,757
You've been mistreated by Oh Yu Jin, too.

58
00:07:00,757 --> 00:07:03,147
Then shouldn't you understand me?

59
00:07:03,147 --> 00:07:04,757
You know what kind of woman she is.

60
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:08,487
How she can drive someone crazy!

61
00:07:08,487 --> 00:07:10,817
You would know.

62
00:07:14,287 --> 00:07:18,107
What did Yu Jin do to you that you're like this?

63
00:07:21,697 --> 00:07:25,637
Then again, what reason would you have needed?

64
00:07:25,637 --> 00:07:27,917
You just wanted to kill her, isn't that right?

65
00:07:27,917 --> 00:07:29,867
Shut up.

66
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:31,047
What do you know?

67
00:07:31,047 --> 00:07:33,777
You just killed your children's mom.

68
00:07:33,777 --> 00:07:35,667
You stole their mom from your children.

69
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:37,567
Damn it! Shut up!

70
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:41,877
And you just keep spewing self-pitying BS.

71
00:07:41,877 --> 00:07:44,497
Just kill me instead.

72
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:48,687
Then, at least, what you've done will be exposed to the world.

73
00:07:48,687 --> 00:07:51,997
Could you guarantee that you wouldn't do the same

74
00:07:51,997 --> 00:07:54,577
if you experience what I have experienced, Jang Mi Ho?

75
00:07:56,107 --> 00:07:59,587
I'm not a piece of trash like you.

76
00:07:59,587 --> 00:08:01,927
Even though this was all Oh Yu Jin's,

77
00:08:01,927 --> 00:08:04,117
that woman's fault?

78
00:08:15,737 --> 00:08:18,557
 The years I've lived with you were horrible.

79
00:08:18,557 --> 00:08:22,467
 You goddamn pride, pride, pride!

80
00:08:22,467 --> 00:08:24,807
 You're so full of insecurities.

81
00:08:24,807 --> 00:08:28,057
 You cared more about what others thought of you!

82
00:08:30,227 --> 00:08:33,627
 Do you think I've ever been satisfied?

83
00:08:33,627 --> 00:08:36,437
 You can't even function properly as a man.

84
00:08:50,367 --> 00:08:53,097
Who is she to look down on me?

85
00:09:11,227 --> 00:09:13,087
 Is anyone inside?

86
00:09:15,747 --> 00:09:17,637
 Is anyone inside?

87
00:09:19,307 --> 00:09:22,177
If you want to die a peaceful death, stay quiet.

88
00:09:34,397 --> 00:09:37,337
What is it?
- You need to leave because I need to lock the front door of the building.

89
00:09:37,337 --> 00:09:40,497
Damn it, haven't you heard from the administrative manager?

90
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:44,097
I said we have an important customer coming in today!

91
00:09:44,097 --> 00:09:45,847
What about the CCTVs?

92
00:09:49,937 --> 00:09:52,217
We've turned them off.

93
00:09:53,117 --> 00:09:55,907
I'll close the front door, so you should go home.

94
00:09:55,907 --> 00:09:57,947
But I also have to set it up.

95
00:10:20,757 --> 00:10:22,887
 I told you to go.

96
00:10:22,887 --> 00:10:24,477
 Do you want to get fired?

97
00:10:24,477 --> 00:10:26,237
All right.

98
00:10:55,217 --> 00:10:57,527
Damn it!

99
00:10:57,527 --> 00:10:59,657
Where are you?

100
00:11:03,787 --> 00:11:06,047
I said, where are you?

101
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,687
Come out.

102
00:11:55,187 --> 00:11:57,277
I will

103
00:11:57,277 --> 00:12:00,177
tell you an interesting story.

104
00:12:06,307 --> 00:12:07,627
You know what?

105
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:09,037
That day,

106
00:12:09,957 --> 00:12:12,707
Yu Jin could have lived.

107
00:12:56,587 --> 00:12:59,737
I intentionally didn't call 911.

108
00:13:24,177 --> 00:13:26,737
Help! Help!

109
00:13:26,737 --> 00:13:28,567
Is anyone here!

110
00:13:56,487 --> 00:13:57,907
- What are you doing? 
- Move!

111
00:13:57,907 --> 00:14:00,627
- What are you doing? 
- I said move!

112
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:24,547
Why do you make me so evil?

113
00:14:24,547 --> 00:14:25,687
Why!

114
00:14:25,687 --> 00:14:29,427
Why aren't you letting me kill you in peace?

115
00:14:29,427 --> 00:14:31,417
Someone is about to die inside.

116
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:34,097
Will you take responsibility if something goes wrong?

117
00:15:14,787 --> 00:15:16,527
Assistant Manager!

118
00:15:25,187 --> 00:15:26,667
Eonni!

119
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:29,327
Gosh, something must have happened to her...

120
00:15:29,327 --> 00:15:31,547
What do we do?

121
00:15:36,547 --> 00:15:39,447
I'll kill him!

122
00:15:39,447 --> 00:15:41,437
Assistant Manager!

123
00:15:41,437 --> 00:15:45,017
Mi Ho! Mi Ho!

124
00:15:49,367 --> 00:15:51,067
Mi Ho!

125
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:56,287
Call the police!

126
00:15:56,287 --> 00:15:58,597
Please check the lower floors. We'll go to the upper floors.

127
00:15:58,597 --> 00:16:00,077
Okay.

128
00:16:52,777 --> 00:16:54,777
Stop it now.

129
00:16:57,907 --> 00:17:00,747
You know it's all over now.

130
00:17:16,487 --> 00:17:18,117
You're right.

131
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:24,007
It's all gone wrong.

132
00:17:25,717 --> 00:17:27,637
So...

133
00:17:28,637 --> 00:17:31,317
I'm thinking about changing the plan.

134
00:17:38,337 --> 00:17:40,857
We should just die together.

135
00:17:41,967 --> 00:17:43,467
In the end,

136
00:17:44,467 --> 00:17:47,357
I think I knew we would end up like this.

137
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:49,637
Crazy bastard.

138
00:17:49,637 --> 00:17:51,327
If you're going to die, die by yourself!

139
00:17:51,327 --> 00:17:53,397
Let's go together.

140
00:17:53,397 --> 00:17:56,237
I want to go with you.

141
00:18:15,277 --> 00:18:17,777
I said I will follow right after you!

142
00:18:18,707 --> 00:18:21,737
Can't you just die!

143
00:18:29,037 --> 00:18:30,807
Mi Ho!

144
00:18:39,317 --> 00:18:41,037
Are you okay?

145
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:43,767
Save me!

146
00:18:43,767 --> 00:18:45,967
I said, save me!

147
00:18:48,847 --> 00:18:53,597
If I die, you will become a murderer, too!

148
00:19:00,877 --> 00:19:04,277
Save me, please! Please!

149
00:19:44,937 --> 00:19:46,777
Are you okay?

150
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:02,017
- Are you okay?
 - Mi Ho.

151
00:20:21,247 --> 00:20:23,627
Something seemed off, so I came up to the roof,

152
00:20:23,627 --> 00:20:26,867
and by the time I reached the top...

153
00:20:57,517 --> 00:20:59,797
The USB...

154
00:21:03,737 --> 00:21:06,317
It was severely damaged, wasn't it?

155
00:21:06,317 --> 00:21:08,367
We'll need to give it a try,

156
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:11,637
but I can't guarantee that we'll be able to recover the data.

157
00:21:12,657 --> 00:21:15,767
The audio file in that USB...

158
00:21:15,767 --> 00:21:19,807
If you have that, you can arrest Kang Do Joon for murder, right?

159
00:21:19,807 --> 00:21:23,827
Well, since Hwang Ji Hye agreed to testify as well,

160
00:21:23,827 --> 00:21:26,277
it would become concrete circumstantial evidence.

161
00:21:34,507 --> 00:21:37,417
I have that file

162
00:21:37,417 --> 00:21:39,227
on my phone.

163
00:21:40,057 --> 00:21:46,047
♫  It's all lies, it's all a fantasy  ♫

164
00:21:46,047 --> 00:21:52,537
♫  It's all fake, can't hide it anymore  ♫

165
00:21:52,537 --> 00:21:55,397
♫  Wake up, break your desire  ♫

166
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:58,337

Hello.

170
00:22:46,137 --> 00:22:50,327
You should have taken a few more days off to rest. I heard you almost died!

171
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:53,777
I'm sorry about leaving so suddenly last time.

172
00:22:55,257 --> 00:22:56,687
Never mind.

173
00:22:56,687 --> 00:22:58,497
All right, I'm glad you're back safe and sound.

174
00:22:58,497 --> 00:23:00,647
See me for a moment.

175
00:23:02,897 --> 00:23:05,957
What are you so surprised about? You expected it, too.

176
00:23:06,957 --> 00:23:10,017
Maybe a promotion, yes, but not an overseas deployment...

177
00:23:10,017 --> 00:23:11,337
I didn't expect it at all.

178
00:23:11,337 --> 00:23:13,947
You didn't expect it, but you're happy with it, right?

179
00:23:13,947 --> 00:23:17,347
You know that going directly from the main branch to an overseas branch

180
00:23:17,347 --> 00:23:19,087
is the path of rapid promotion.

181
00:23:19,087 --> 00:23:22,237
Do well on the interview, and make sure to pass.

182
00:23:23,147 --> 00:23:25,397
And take it easy for today.

183
00:23:40,347 --> 00:23:42,297
Assistant Manager, is it true?

184
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:45,427
Where did you manage to hear the news?

185
00:23:45,427 --> 00:23:47,807
I know I should be congratulating you,

186
00:23:51,327 --> 00:23:53,757

We'll be so sad when you leave.

It's not like we won't ever be able to see each other again.

00:24:41,337 --> 00:24:44,977
But it's so far away, so I wonder if we'll be able to go.

You said you're sending Min Seong to a regular kindergarten, right?

I guess he'll be able to play as much as he wants, so good for him.

205
00:24:53,477 --> 00:24:55,907
Then don't come.

Do you have anything you need?

I don't know.

00:25:12,097 --> 00:25:14,557
Oh, my skin is a bit sensitive these days.

212
00:25:14,557 --> 00:25:17,517
Oh, I actually prepared something for you.

213
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:19,817
Here, try this.

214
00:25:21,767 --> 00:25:25,647
My skin is on the sensitive side, but it was really good.

215
00:25:27,117 --> 00:25:28,797
Try it.

216
00:25:32,147 --> 00:25:34,987
Wow, it absorbs so well into the skin.

217
00:25:34,987 --> 00:25:38,097
It's a product that Na Yeong uses, so, of course!

You're good at sales, too.

Do you want to work in sales instead of planning?

 Can I come, too?

231
00:26:42,297 --> 00:26:46,347
Just because you're not my husband doesn't mean you're not Ah Rin's dad.

232
00:26:46,347 --> 00:26:50,207
I would like for you to fulfill all your duties as a father to Ah Rin.

00:27:33,197 --> 00:27:35,057

240
00:27:35,057 --> 00:27:36,677
What about it?

241
00:27:36,677 --> 00:27:38,357
I mean,

242
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:41,077
why is this in the safe?

243
00:27:42,517 --> 00:27:44,107
You didn't throw it out?

244
00:27:46,557 --> 00:27:50,467
I'm going to keep in mind that you betrayed me.

245
00:27:52,357 --> 00:27:56,117
Su Bin, I don't cut ties with people close to me easily,

246
00:27:56,117 --> 00:27:58,707
but that doesn't mean I've forgiven you completely.

247
00:28:17,857 --> 00:28:21,267
If you need to consult with another department, you should have created and recruited consultants

248
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:23,687
and made an official request.

249
00:28:25,677 --> 00:28:29,637

Oh, really?

251
00:28:36,647 --> 00:28:39,897
Then we'll handle the splitting of duties.

255
00:28:46,657 --> 00:28:48,637
I don't know.

256
00:28:48,637 --> 00:28:50,117
Unbelievable.

257
00:28:50,117 --> 00:28:52,107
I can't hear very well.

258
00:28:56,017 --> 00:28:57,687
We should leave, too.

259
00:28:57,687 --> 00:28:59,027
You guys should go home first.

260
00:28:59,027 --> 00:29:01,057
I'll go after doing a little more work.

261
00:29:03,247 --> 00:29:06,077
I cancel what I said about wanting the old Assistant Manager Jang back.

262
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,847
Don't overdo it, and just go home.

263
00:29:07,847 --> 00:29:08,887

Do you know you're acting weird, Assistant Manager?

266
00:29:16,447 --> 00:29:18,867
You refuse to talk about what happened back then.

267
00:29:21,887 --> 00:29:26,707
Aren't you even curious about how Ji Yool and Ha Yool are doing?

268
00:29:30,557 --> 00:29:33,337
What more is there to talk about? It's all over.

269
00:29:39,047 --> 00:29:41,357
I told you to leave.

270
00:29:41,357 --> 00:29:44,297
Could you leave? I want to work alone.

271
00:29:45,887 --> 00:29:50,467
Okay. But if you ever feel like talking about it, talk to me.

 Complaint

279
00:31:25,897 --> 00:31:29,267
 I have a complaint about Jang Mi Ho of the social media marketing team

280
00:31:29,267 --> 00:31:30,767
 in the digital division of your company.

281
00:31:30,767 --> 00:31:33,837
 I am exposing the true face of Jang Mi Ho of 11th grade, Class 12.

282
00:31:33,837 --> 00:31:38,687
 However, not too long ago, Jang Mi Ho appeared and threatened to expose the past...

283
00:31:38,687 --> 00:31:41,557
 Jang Mi Ho fooled everyone with her model student pretense.

284
00:31:41,557 --> 00:31:43,757
 As a result, I ended up getting nervous breakdowns

285
00:31:43,757 --> 00:31:46,757
 from anxiety and fear, and couldn't even sleep.

286
00:31:46,757 --> 00:31:51,047
-  Is she trying to destroy our family? 
  -  Jang Mi Ho even tried to seduce her stepfather.

287
00:31:51,047 --> 00:31:55,337
-  Living every day with extreme fear like this is hell. 
-  If I'm going to be blamed unfairly like this...

288
00:31:55,337 --> 00:31:58,877
 I'm so tortured that I feel it would be better to just die.

289

 I'm thinking of just killing myself.

290
00:32:01,517 --> 00:32:04,837
 Please... Please... I hope the bank will take measures so she can't approach me anymore.

291
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:10,010
 I'm suffering so much. Every day is hell for me. I'm in such torment that it would be better to just die.

00:37:50,467 --> 00:37:53,347
 Take me with you!

328
00:37:53,347 --> 00:37:55,917
 Hey, take me with you!

329
00:37:58,757 --> 00:38:01,587
 Hey, I said, let's go together!

330
00:38:02,707 --> 00:38:04,697
 But why don't you call me eonni?

331
00:38:04,697 --> 00:38:07,937
 We're the same age, so why would I call you eonni?

332
00:38:07,937 --> 00:38:10,227
 You're right...

333
00:38:10,227 --> 00:38:13,157
 Then call me whatever you want.

334
00:38:18,377 --> 00:38:20,687
 Hey! Oh Yu Jin!

335
00:38:27,027 --> 00:38:30,117
 You just used your PTO! Going on vacation again?

336
00:38:30,117 --> 00:38:32,717
I'm not going on vacation. I'm taking a half-day off.

337
00:38:32,717 --> 00:38:34,197
 That's the same thing!

338
00:38:34,197 --> 00:38:36,127
 Is it because of the kids?

339
00:38:36,127 --> 00:38:39,297
 But that's just your feelings of duty, you know?

340
00:38:39,297 --> 00:38:41,067
Still, I can't help it. I don't feel comfortable with this.

341
00:38:41,067 --> 00:38:43,737
I think I'll have to at least see the kids once.

342
00:38:46,577 --> 00:38:49,127
Ji Yool, Ha Yool?

343
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:51,657
Ji Yool!

344
00:38:51,657 --> 00:38:54,907
 The call is not going through...

345
00:38:54,907 --> 00:38:57,137
Ji Yool, Ha Yool!

346
00:38:57,137 --> 00:38:58,237
Ji Yool!

347
00:38:58,237 --> 00:39:00,057
Who are you?

348
00:39:01,507 --> 00:39:03,687
I came to see the people living here.

349
00:39:03,687 --> 00:39:07,727
I see. They moved out this morning.

350
00:39:07,727 --> 00:39:09,267
Pardon?

351
00:39:09,267 --> 00:39:10,447
To where?

352
00:39:10,447 --> 00:39:13,477
I wouldn't know that, either. Ask the realtor.

353
00:39:22,917 --> 00:39:24,857
Yes, I'll look for it.

354
00:39:24,857 --> 00:39:25,957
Yes.

355
00:39:25,957 --> 00:39:29,857
You said you placed it between the transaction documents, right?

356
00:39:39,767 --> 00:39:41,097
 Divorce Specialist Lawyer | Attorney Kim Seon Ju

357
00:39:41,097 --> 00:39:43,287
Yes, okay.

358
00:39:46,767 --> 00:39:48,947
What do you mean by divorce?

359
00:39:48,947 --> 00:39:52,467
My wife was just throwing a tantrum.

360
00:39:52,467 --> 00:39:54,937
This time will probably last about three months.

361
00:39:54,937 --> 00:39:58,507
She's trying to scare me and take control.

362
00:39:59,507 --> 00:40:03,227
Hey, hey, don't worry. We'll be getting back together.

363
00:40:03,227 --> 00:40:05,397
Yeah, okay.

364
00:40:11,187 --> 00:40:13,097
Can I help you?

365
00:40:15,397 --> 00:40:19,757
What would be good for a commemorative wedding ring for my wife?

366
00:40:19,757 --> 00:40:22,727
Your wife must be so happy.

367
00:40:40,057 --> 00:40:41,877
It's not bad.

368
00:40:46,997 --> 00:40:48,927
 The woman who can't live without me ♥

369
00:40:48,927 --> 00:40:50,957
 Lee Tae Ho

370
00:40:59,547 --> 00:41:00,947
- Na Yeong. 
- What do you want?

371
00:41:00,947 --> 00:41:02,817
Can I drop by your house for a moment?

372
00:41:02,817 --> 00:41:04,607
I have something to give you.

373
00:41:06,147 --> 00:41:07,727
Fine.

374
00:41:14,777 --> 00:41:16,417
Na Yeong.

375
00:41:16,417 --> 00:41:19,127
- Let me come in for a second. 
- Where do you think you're going?

376
00:41:20,127 --> 00:41:22,367
Wow, our second child is growing quickly.

377
00:41:22,367 --> 00:41:23,967
How many weeks is it now?

378
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,847
I've treated you so badly.

379
00:41:27,847 --> 00:41:30,547
If we think about Ah Rin and the baby you're carrying,

380
00:41:30,547 --> 00:41:33,307
we shouldn't be like this.

381
00:41:33,307 --> 00:41:35,867
Let's please just get back together.

382
00:41:35,867 --> 00:41:37,947
What are you doing?

383
00:41:37,947 --> 00:41:39,317
You must be mistaken,

384
00:41:39,317 --> 00:41:41,527
but you and I are strangers now.

385
00:41:41,527 --> 00:41:43,577
How could we become strangers?

386
00:41:43,577 --> 00:41:45,717
We have two kids together!

387
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,347
All right.

388
00:41:48,347 --> 00:41:50,007
You be Ah Rin's father,

389
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:53,407
and try your hardest to be a good dad to her.

390
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:56,687
But you are not my husband.

391
00:41:56,687 --> 00:41:58,407
Seriously, why are you being like this?

392
00:41:58,407 --> 00:42:00,547
And I'll raise the monthly rent for the Yimyeong-dong studio,

393
00:42:00,547 --> 00:42:03,077
so send me 1.5 million won starting next month.

394
00:42:03,077 --> 00:42:05,337
You've been late on your child support by few days.

395
00:42:05,337 --> 00:42:09,907
If you're late one more time, you'll receive a litigation letter, so do as you wish.

396
00:42:11,387 --> 00:42:12,857
Na Yeong—

397
00:42:34,597 --> 00:42:36,487
 Song Jeong Ah - Min Seong's mother

398
00:42:38,177 --> 00:42:39,867
Yes, Song Jeong Ah.

399
00:42:39,867 --> 00:42:41,507
 How are you feeling physically?

400
00:42:41,507 --> 00:42:44,557
I'm doing well. Have you been well?

401
00:42:44,557 --> 00:42:46,087
 Somewhat.

402
00:42:46,087 --> 00:42:48,547
 I noticed you left the Gold Moms chatroom.

403
00:42:48,547 --> 00:42:51,697
 And it seems like you withdrew from the mom cafe.

404
00:42:51,697 --> 00:42:54,747
I felt like it no longer pertained to me.

405
00:42:55,747 --> 00:42:58,527
 There is a family day event at the kindergarten tomorrow.

406
00:42:58,527 --> 00:43:02,217
 I know Ji Yool and Ha Yool are leaving for the US tomorrow,

407
00:43:02,217 --> 00:43:05,607
 but since there's a surprise gift from the kids, you should come.

408
00:43:07,897 --> 00:43:10,857
The kids aren't even there, so how could I go?

409
00:43:10,857 --> 00:43:13,427
Something important is happening at work tomorrow, too.

410
00:43:14,707 --> 00:43:16,557
Still, thank you for letting me know.

411
00:43:16,557 --> 00:43:18,697
I'll be hanging up now.

412
00:43:30,337 --> 00:43:32,037
 Kang Bong Seok

413
00:44:21,767 --> 00:44:24,107
 Can you give her a jjong-jjong hairstyle?

414
00:44:24,107 --> 00:44:28,837
 Dummy. Only Mommy knows how to do a jjong-jjong hairstyle.

415
00:44:32,817 --> 00:44:35,887
 Real Auntie...

416
00:45:32,557 --> 00:45:33,677
You're late.

417
00:45:33,677 --> 00:45:35,607
Did you take care of it?

418
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:39,647
Yeah, well, Team Leader Park did a lot of the work.

419
00:45:39,647 --> 00:45:42,667
You run the company well now, even without me.

420
00:45:51,777 --> 00:45:53,407
What's wrong with you?

421
00:45:55,837 --> 00:45:58,117
 Divorce Specialist Lawyer | Attorney Kim Seon Ju

422
00:46:00,517 --> 00:46:01,977
Noona,

423
00:46:01,977 --> 00:46:03,707
I...

424
00:46:04,657 --> 00:46:07,577
I've really committed a big sin against you.

425
00:46:08,577 --> 00:46:10,337
I...

426
00:46:10,337 --> 00:46:15,267
I hurt you in an irreparable way.

427
00:46:21,837 --> 00:46:23,847
Back then,

428
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:26,417
I was so busy making excuses

429
00:46:27,807 --> 00:46:33,277
that I didn't apologize to you properly.

430
00:46:34,307 --> 00:46:40,257
I know our relationship can never go back to how it was before, no matter what I do.

431
00:46:40,257 --> 00:46:44,647
I know... I know that, but...

432
00:46:45,607 --> 00:46:49,077
But when I think that we're breaking up, Noona,

433
00:46:51,587 --> 00:46:54,417
I feel like I'll go crazy.

434
00:47:01,037 --> 00:47:04,897
Noona, you... you don't have to forgive me for the rest of your life.

435
00:47:04,897 --> 00:47:06,317
Just...

436
00:47:08,267 --> 00:47:11,877
could you let me stay by your side, Noona?

437
00:47:11,877 --> 00:47:14,587
Please. Please.

438
00:47:14,587 --> 00:47:19,077
Noona, can you just give me one more chance?

439
00:47:38,127 --> 00:47:40,747
What are you thinking right now?

440
00:47:40,747 --> 00:47:44,397
A friend just gave me this after he dropped by.

441
00:47:50,057 --> 00:47:51,757
Get up.

442
00:48:01,207 --> 00:48:03,397
You're right.

443
00:48:03,397 --> 00:48:08,307
The wound you gave me will probably never go away.

444
00:48:08,307 --> 00:48:11,067
I'll probably blame and hate you for it,

445
00:48:11,067 --> 00:48:14,327
and get hurt again from it.

446
00:48:14,327 --> 00:48:15,567
But...

447
00:48:16,447 --> 00:48:18,767
deciding to live with you despite that...

448
00:48:19,657 --> 00:48:21,617
is my choice.

449
00:48:36,617 --> 00:48:38,217
Hello, parents.

450
00:48:38,217 --> 00:48:41,837
Welcome to today's 10th family day festival.

451
00:48:41,837 --> 00:48:46,617
Our children really worked hard to prepare this for the parents,

452
00:48:46,617 --> 00:48:49,107
so please cheer loudly for them.

453
00:48:49,107 --> 00:48:54,577
Now, please enjoy the surprise event by the kids.

454
00:48:57,897 --> 00:49:01,787
 Hello, Mom and Dad. It's Min Seong.

455
00:49:01,787 --> 00:49:05,967
 I've been naughty and whining a lot these days.

456
00:49:05,967 --> 00:49:09,367
 I'm sorry for upsetting you, Mom and Dad.

457
00:49:09,367 --> 00:49:14,397
 I know you are busy with work, Mom and Dad.

458
00:49:14,397 --> 00:49:18,537
 From now on, I'll be good and listen to you well.

459
00:49:18,537 --> 00:49:21,527
 I love you a lot, Mom and Dad!

460
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:24,927
Min Seong!

461
00:49:32,447 --> 00:49:33,947
What is this?

462
00:49:33,947 --> 00:49:37,907
You can use this whenever you want to play with Min Seong.

463
00:49:37,907 --> 00:49:40,657
Thank you, Min Seong.

464
00:49:40,657 --> 00:49:42,627
 Hello, Mom and Dad!

465
00:49:42,627 --> 00:49:45,997
 I'll love you more from now, Mom and Dad!

466
00:49:45,997 --> 00:49:47,007
 It's Eun Han.

467
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:50,357
 I'll become good Eun Han and get along with my friends.

468
00:49:50,357 --> 00:49:53,597
 Mom and Dad, hello! It's Ah Rin.

469
00:49:53,597 --> 00:49:56,787
 Mom and Dad, I want to show as much love I've received from you

470
00:49:56,787 --> 00:50:01,027
 - to my younger sibling who will be born. 
 - What is this?

471
00:50:01,027 --> 00:50:05,637
 I love you both equally so much!

472
00:50:06,637 --> 00:50:09,057
Daddy is sorry.

473
00:50:13,717 --> 00:50:15,377
I love you.

474
00:50:17,517 --> 00:50:19,567
 Auntie. It's Ji Yool...

475
00:50:19,567 --> 00:50:21,497
 and Ha Yool!

476
00:50:21,497 --> 00:50:27,377
 Auntie, thank you for taking care of us after Mom went to heaven.

477
00:50:27,377 --> 00:50:30,347
 Auntie, you're this great of a person.

478
00:50:30,347 --> 00:50:37,507
 I hope you won't ever forget about us, even when we go to the US, Auntie.

479
00:50:37,507 --> 00:50:40,857
 Auntie, we sent you a surprise gift.

480
00:50:40,857 --> 00:50:45,607
 It's Ha Yool's most prized treasure, but we want to give it to you, Auntie.

481
00:50:45,607 --> 00:50:49,207
 Auntie, I hope you won't be sad anymore.

482
00:50:49,207 --> 00:50:52,507
 Auntie, you are our real aunt.

483
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:55,917
 Real Auntie, we love you!

484
00:51:22,987 --> 00:51:24,797
 - Yes.  
- Mr. Kang, where are you?

485
00:51:24,797 --> 00:51:26,037
You haven't left yet, right?

486
00:51:26,037 --> 00:51:27,317
 Why are you curious about that?

487
00:51:27,317 --> 00:51:31,557
Please wait just a moment! There's something I must tell you and the kids.

488
00:51:52,187 --> 00:51:56,497
You know that raising them is not always easy and happy.

489
00:51:56,497 --> 00:52:01,047
You will regret this many times, regardless of your sense of responsibility.

490
00:52:01,977 --> 00:52:03,707
So will you really take them in and raise them?

491
00:52:03,707 --> 00:52:07,657
Yes. If the kids will let me.

492
00:52:22,107 --> 00:52:23,727
Hey, guys.

493
00:52:29,127 --> 00:52:32,507
Ji Yool and Ha Yool, how have you been?

494
00:52:38,927 --> 00:52:42,057
I know how scared you guys are.

495
00:52:43,427 --> 00:52:47,107
I may not be your real aunt,

496
00:52:47,107 --> 00:52:50,217
but I want to become a real aunt to you.

497
00:52:53,407 --> 00:52:56,207
I was stupid, so I didn't know.

498
00:52:58,117 --> 00:53:00,167
I need you two.

499
00:53:00,167 --> 00:53:02,407
I want so much...

500
00:53:02,407 --> 00:53:05,167
to be with you guys.

501
00:53:07,847 --> 00:53:11,507
Ji Yool and Ha Yool, will you give permission so I can?

502
00:53:11,507 --> 00:53:13,667
You're lying.

503
00:53:13,667 --> 00:53:17,217
Mommy and Daddy both left us.

504
00:53:17,217 --> 00:53:20,077
And you left us, too, Auntie.

505
00:53:20,077 --> 00:53:22,147
That's not true. You see, I came back.

506
00:53:22,147 --> 00:53:23,547
You're going to leave us.

507
00:53:23,547 --> 00:53:26,627
I won't ever leave you. I promise.

508
00:53:26,627 --> 00:53:29,417
- Really?
 - Yeah.

509
00:53:31,937 --> 00:53:33,797
Ha Yool, you, too.

510
00:53:37,697 --> 00:53:40,707
- Auntie!
- Auntie!

511
00:53:52,967 --> 00:53:56,427
 A teenager in Yeoncheon High School was arrested

512
00:53:56,427 --> 00:53:58,377
 by the police for murdering his classmate.

513
00:53:58,377 --> 00:54:02,077
 It was revealed that she ended up committing the crime after feeling deprivation and jealousy

514
00:54:02,077 --> 00:54:04,197
 from her friend's social media post of luxury brand items.

515
00:54:04,197 --> 00:54:06,547
- Hwang Ji Hye.
  - Reporter Lee Hong Yeop will deliver the news.

516
00:54:06,547 --> 00:54:08,357
You have a visitor.

517
00:54:31,587 --> 00:54:34,737
I'm sorry. Seong Hui...

518
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:38,907
I...

519
00:54:40,117 --> 00:54:42,577
I'm really sorry.

520
00:54:46,267 --> 00:54:49,307
I'm so sorry that I could die.

521
00:54:49,307 --> 00:54:51,327
You're right.

522
00:54:51,327 --> 00:54:53,237
You should be that sorry.

523
00:54:53,237 --> 00:54:55,897
After what you've done to me, Ji Hye.

524
00:54:58,507 --> 00:55:02,637
Even when I think about it now, it's so horrible, and Ji Hye...

525
00:55:04,297 --> 00:55:07,237
I can never forgive you, but

526
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:12,627
just serve a sentence that fits your crime.

527
00:55:20,397 --> 00:55:24,037
Eun Han misses So Won a lot.

528
00:55:27,277 --> 00:55:30,107
Eun Han and So Won should

529
00:55:31,817 --> 00:55:33,997
become friends again later.

530
00:55:40,947 --> 00:55:42,787
What a shame.

531
00:55:42,787 --> 00:55:44,797
It's such a shame, seriously.

532
00:55:44,797 --> 00:55:47,457
You were set for a promotion with the overseas deployment,

533
00:55:47,457 --> 00:55:49,887
so why at this time...
  Assistant Manager Jang Mi Ho

534
00:55:56,717 --> 00:55:58,577
- You did well.
 - It came out well, right?

535
00:55:58,577 --> 00:56:00,307
Great work.

536
00:56:04,587 --> 00:56:08,477
It's Uncle!

537
00:56:12,647 --> 00:56:15,247
- Surprise!
 - Uncle!

538
00:56:15,247 --> 00:56:16,647
How much did you miss me?

539
00:56:16,647 --> 00:56:19,107
- A lot!
 - A lot?

540
00:56:26,677 --> 00:56:28,807
Ji Yool and Ha Yool, you should go to sleep.

541
00:56:28,807 --> 00:56:30,277
I don't want to! I don't want to sleep.

542
00:56:30,277 --> 00:56:31,937
It's late. You should sleep.

543
00:56:31,937 --> 00:56:33,197
You know what tomorrow is.

544
00:56:33,197 --> 00:56:36,247
Then, Real Uncle should read us a story today.

545
00:56:36,247 --> 00:56:38,337
Okay, what book should I read for you?

546
00:56:38,337 --> 00:56:41,387
Let's go. Let's go inside.

547
00:56:41,387 --> 00:56:43,057
Let's go.

548
00:57:18,587 --> 00:57:19,807
 ID: miho_jang726 | Password: ooyj0328

549
00:57:19,807 --> 00:57:22,917
 You always use that password. What is that number?

550
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:25,367
 It's my birth mom's birthday.

551
00:57:25,367 --> 00:57:27,857
 Help me...

552
00:57:27,857 --> 00:57:31,627
 You know... number...

553
00:57:33,037 --> 00:57:35,557
 You know the number.

554
00:57:41,637 --> 00:57:43,667
 ooo_yoojin

555
00:57:48,337 --> 00:57:50,467
 Delete it for me...

556
00:58:00,887 --> 00:58:04,337
 ooo_yoojin

557
00:58:04,337 --> 00:58:08,467
 I came with Ji Yool and Ha Yool to Paradise.

558
00:58:08,467 --> 00:58:11,397
 Look, it's so pretty, right?

559
00:58:11,397 --> 00:58:13,087
Kids,

560
00:58:14,577 --> 00:58:18,027
all right, Mommy is coming!

561
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:20,287
Catch me if you can!

562
00:58:21,477 --> 00:58:24,017
 Let's take a picture here together.

563
00:58:26,067 --> 00:58:27,467
 You're wearing a hat?

564
00:58:27,467 --> 00:58:29,787
 Shall I wear a hat, too?

565
00:58:29,787 --> 00:58:32,887
 All right, look over here. One, two, three!

566
00:58:32,887 --> 00:58:35,567
 Bye!

567
00:58:41,957 --> 00:58:46,947
 We decided to bury the traces she's left behind for now.

568
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:52,070
 Thank you to our Channel Manager: taeyang30.

569
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:55,990
 Thank you to all our language moderators, translators, &amp; editors.

 Thank you to  our Chief Segmenter: Bjohnsonwong.

571
00:59:01,467 --> 00:59:03,717
All right, let's get some water.

572
00:59:03,717 --> 00:59:04,927
I'm going first!

573
00:59:04,927 --> 00:59:07,367
Take me with you!

574
00:59:15,057 --> 00:59:17,447
 Mom

575
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:22,260
 Thank you to our English Editors: Joysprite (Chief), Mindmuse (Translation).

576
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:26,100
 Mom

577
00:59:28,267 --> 00:59:32,307
 Mom, the three of us will come over to your house next time.

I think that's good.

584
01:00:06,967 --> 01:00:08,347
I think you can cover up the entire wall with it.

585
01:00:08,347 --> 01:00:10,457
What do you all think?

586
01:00:10,457 --> 01:00:12,087
Will it be possible? It's a good idea, right?

587
01:00:12,087 --> 01:00:13,297
- I'm sorry.
 - Could you give that to me?

588
01:00:13,297 --> 01:00:14,697
Yes.

589
01:00:17,307 --> 01:00:22,397
 To So Won, whom I love the most in this world.

590
01:00:24,697 --> 01:00:30,717

593

 It's good enough to just cherish the memories.

594
01:00:43,257 --> 01:00:47,187
 The happy feelings, the memories I don't want to forget,

595
01:00:47,187 --> 01:00:49,857
 the moments I don't want to let go.

596
01:00:52,957 --> 01:00:56,787
 I think it would be good to store them forever
