 This is a work of fiction. Characters, locations, agencies, incidents, organizations, and jobs have no relation to real life.

 Previously 

12
00:00:58,474 --> 00:01:01,344
 But who is that woman sitting with the bereaved? 

13
00:01:01,344 --> 00:01:02,974
 I heard she's Yu Jin's sister. 

14
00:01:02,974 --> 00:01:04,934
 Her older or younger sister? 

15
00:01:04,934 --> 00:01:06,424
 Yu Jin! 

16
00:01:06,424 --> 00:01:10,094
 Who did this? Who did this to you? 

17
00:01:10,094 --> 00:01:11,874
 What is it? 

18
00:01:11,874 --> 00:01:14,984
 What kind of USB is it? 

19
00:01:14,984 --> 00:01:17,914
 Ji Yool, do you know what a USB is? 

20
00:01:17,914 --> 00:01:21,314
 Yes. The one in the office. Mom's. 

21
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:25,434
 Yu Jin was that cafe's staff. 

22
00:01:25,434 --> 00:01:30,194
 She probably had the most dirt on moms in this neighborhood.

00:01:37,454 --> 00:01:40,134
 I knew this would happen! I'm going to kill you! 

27
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:42,494
 I won't let you get away with it this time. 

28
00:01:42,494 --> 00:01:46,744
 So Won has the same eyes as you when she smiles. 

29
00:01:46,744 --> 00:01:49,074
 
 I don't think you need to worry.  

30
00:01:49,074 --> 00:01:50,754
 Don't make a sound and stay quiet. 

31
00:01:50,754 --> 00:01:54,554
 Don't rally the moms by spreading weird rumors about me. 

32
00:01:54,554 --> 00:01:57,754
 Did you do drugs or not? 

33
00:01:57,754 --> 00:02:01,754
 After everything I did for you... 

34
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,504
 Job Application 

35
00:02:20,844 --> 00:02:25,474
 The investigation of the Bannae-dong couple murder case is entering a new stage. 

36
00:02:25,474 --> 00:02:29,584
 A couple was stabbed in a luxury apartment in Bannae-dong on the fifth of this month. 

37
00:02:29,584 --> 00:02:31,214
 Wife 'A' passed away, 

38
00:02:31,214 --> 00:02:35,044
 and husband 'B' was taken to the hospital. 

39
00:02:35,044 --> 00:02:37,494
 Husband 'B,' who regained consciousness recently 

40
00:02:37,494 --> 00:02:41,574
 testified that it resulted from a fight between the couple. 

41
00:02:41,574 --> 00:02:45,284
 The police, who were making little progress with the case, 

42
00:02:45,284 --> 00:02:47,104
 reported they will investigate based on 

43
00:02:47,104 --> 00:02:50,874
 'B''s testimony that the incident was an accident during a fight 

44
00:02:50,874 --> 00:02:53,784
 rather than an act of crime by a third party. 

45
00:02:53,784 --> 00:02:55,614
Ms. Jang.

46
00:02:55,614 --> 00:02:57,394
Who's this?

47
00:02:58,304 --> 00:03:01,594
Ms. Jang, that's not important right now.

48
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:13,804
Detective.

49
00:03:13,804 --> 00:03:17,654
Jang Mi Ho, You need to come with us to the station.

50
00:03:17,654 --> 00:03:20,164
Excuse me? About what?

51
00:03:20,164 --> 00:03:24,044
You need to accompany me on suspicion of instigating the murder of Kang Do Joon.

52
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:27,284
Instigating murder? Me?

53
00:03:27,284 --> 00:03:29,004
Why don't we talk more at the station?

54
00:03:29,004 --> 00:03:31,534
She can't do that right now. The kids are here.

55
00:03:31,534 --> 00:03:34,234
- It's not compulsory, right.
 - We need to check something right away.

56
00:03:34,234 --> 00:03:36,594
Do you have an arrest warrant?

57
00:03:36,594 --> 00:03:39,134
This is for a material witness statement, right?

58
00:03:40,914 --> 00:03:42,244
Then let's do it that way.

59
00:03:42,244 --> 00:03:44,414
You can come in tomorrow morning.

60
00:03:44,414 --> 00:03:48,464
You may face additional penalties if you don't come, so you must come in tomorrow.

61
00:03:51,044 --> 00:03:54,634
What is it? Why did they come at this time of night?

62
00:03:57,164 --> 00:04:00,174
Don't worry too much. It's probably nothing serious.

63
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:07,144
 Episode 9 

64
00:04:07,144 --> 00:04:11,474
 Bannae Police Station 

65
00:04:17,154 --> 00:04:21,064
Jang Mi Ho, the day you first met Oh Yu Jin was...

66
00:04:22,064 --> 00:04:24,004
October 29th.

67
00:04:24,004 --> 00:04:27,574
It was 30 days before Yu Jin died.

68
00:04:27,574 --> 00:04:29,774
You have a good memory.

69
00:04:31,674 --> 00:04:33,534
This is already the fourth time.

70
00:04:33,534 --> 00:04:37,564
Don't you think I would remember it even if I didn't want to?

71
00:04:38,854 --> 00:04:42,434
I look forward to your good memory today as well.

72
00:04:42,434 --> 00:04:44,614
How did you end up meeting Oh Yu Jin again?

73
00:04:44,614 --> 00:04:47,754
You haven't kept in touch with her for 18 years.

74
00:04:49,341 --> 00:04:51,621
I think I already told you last time.

75
00:04:51,621 --> 00:04:53,681
It was a coincidence.

76
00:04:55,841 --> 00:04:59,001
She most likely approached her deliberately.

77
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:04,601
If it wasn't deliberate, why would she suddenly contact a sister she's cut ties with?

78
00:05:04,601 --> 00:05:07,471
It's not like they're blood relatives.

79
00:05:07,471 --> 00:05:09,941
Jang Mi Ho provoked my wife.

80
00:05:09,941 --> 00:05:13,741
My wife had always been a very anxious person.

81
00:05:16,531 --> 00:05:21,851
I first met Yu Jin at an office workers' orchestra club.

82
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:27,191
 September 3rd, 2012 

83
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:48,191
 Even while we were dating, I knew she'd lie at any given moment. 

84
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:51,751
 Didn't you say you used to go skiing often at Whistler when you lived in Vancouver? 

85
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:53,031
 Did I? 

86
00:05:53,031 --> 00:05:56,191
 I was so young then. I must have forgotten how to ski. 

87
00:05:56,191 --> 00:05:59,591
 Come on, your form isn't that of someone who has skied before. 

88
00:05:59,591 --> 00:06:01,871
 Honey, there is something off about the way you're talking right now. 

89
00:06:01,871 --> 00:06:04,621
 Then are you saying I lied? 

90
00:06:04,621 --> 00:06:06,511
 No. 

91
00:06:12,661 --> 00:06:14,961
 I didn't think it'd be a big problem in our marriage. 

92
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:16,951
 - What are you sorry about?
 - But it grew worse over time. 

93
00:06:16,951 --> 00:06:18,411
 You said I was wrong! 

94
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:21,511
 - Do I just loaf around? 
- Am I asking for too much of you? 

95
00:06:21,511 --> 00:06:23,671
 Does it feel that unfair when I ask you to buy me something? 

96
00:06:23,671 --> 00:06:25,091
 This is not the first time! 

97
00:06:25,091 --> 00:06:27,971
 - You're just looking down on me! 
- I said I'd buy it tomorrow! 

98
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:30,551
 It became uncontrollable when she started social media. 

99
00:06:30,551 --> 00:06:33,051
  It got so bad that I wondered if it was an illness. 

100
00:06:33,051 --> 00:06:35,771
 A bouquet my husband bought me on the way from work. 

101
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:38,251
 He said he thought of me. 

102
00:06:40,931 --> 00:06:43,571
 Surprise gifts like this are always welcome! 

103
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:46,771
 I told him I was tired, so he set up a feast for me. 

104
00:06:46,771 --> 00:06:48,971
 Thanks, my hubby! 

105
00:07:05,001 --> 00:07:07,811
 I wondered if she cared too much about what others thought. 

106
00:07:07,811 --> 00:07:09,401
But that wasn't it.

107
00:07:09,401 --> 00:07:12,901
She really did have a disorder. She had delusions.

108
00:07:13,451 --> 00:07:15,921
On the day of the children's performance...

109
00:07:19,201 --> 00:07:22,851
 H-How is Ji Yool? 

110
00:07:22,851 --> 00:07:25,841
 She got slightly hit by So Won's wand, but I think Ji Yool... 

111
00:07:25,841 --> 00:07:30,171
 She even ran up to the stage, thinking another child hit our child. 

112
00:07:32,101 --> 00:07:33,381
 Ji Yool, what do you want to eat? 

113
00:07:33,381 --> 00:07:35,911
 - Pad thai! 
- Please give us a pad thai, 

114
00:07:35,911 --> 00:07:38,031
 and take out the peanuts. 

115
00:07:39,601 --> 00:07:44,531
 She really believed our child had peanut allergies when she didn't! 

116
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:49,931
She believed the world she created in her thoughts and fantasies was real.

117
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:52,691
It was driving me crazy,

118
00:07:52,691 --> 00:07:55,361
so I said they were all delusions, and she went ballistic.

119
00:07:55,361 --> 00:07:56,921
 - What did you say! 
- Seriously! 

120
00:07:56,921 --> 00:07:58,751
 I'm going nuts here! 

121
00:07:58,751 --> 00:08:01,311
 Don't hit me, don't hit me! 

122
00:08:06,571 --> 00:08:08,621
 It was from that moment. 

123
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:14,141
 She was engrossed in articles of husbands killing their wives. 

124
00:08:15,001 --> 00:08:19,891
 Has anyone felt afraid for their lives by their husbands? 

125
00:08:19,891 --> 00:08:23,111
 She thought I would kill her. 

126
00:08:25,901 --> 00:08:29,631
But this isn't something I could convince her about with words.

127
00:08:29,631 --> 00:08:32,441
To put her at ease, I even put our house under my wife's name,

128
00:08:32,441 --> 00:08:35,211
and gave her control of our finances.

129
00:08:35,211 --> 00:08:37,831
I thought things were getting better after that...

130
00:08:39,701 --> 00:08:44,401
The one who added fuel to my wife's delusions was Jang Mi Ho.

131
00:08:44,401 --> 00:08:47,181
After she met that woman, her symptoms grew worse.

132
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:50,581
As if she was egging her on to attack first to avoid the fight.

133
00:08:50,581 --> 00:08:52,281
That makes no sense.

134
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:55,591
On the first day we met, we were together maybe 15 minutes.

135
00:08:55,591 --> 00:08:57,941
We had no time to talk about stuff like that.

136
00:08:57,941 --> 00:08:59,446
Then what did you talk about?

137
00:08:59,446 --> 00:09:02,541
About how we were doing and how our respective parents were doing.

138
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:05,841
Was that all? And you didn't receive anything?

139
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:49,701
It looked like about 20 million won was given to her.

140
00:09:54,351 --> 00:09:56,341
That day,

141
00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:58,741
our kids had gone camping.

142
00:09:58,741 --> 00:10:03,481
She said she had something to tell me, so I should come home early.

143
00:10:05,191 --> 00:10:06,881
 Oh Yu Jin: Come home quickly / Let's talk 

144
00:10:06,881 --> 00:10:08,111
 ooo_yoojin 

145
00:10:08,111 --> 00:10:10,201
 It's a date night for just the two of us tonight. 

146
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:12,001
 The kids are away at an overnight camp, 

147
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:15,331
 and we plan for a cozy night together. 

148
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:17,511
 She even brought out the champagne. 

149
00:10:18,131 --> 00:10:20,661
She was acting a bit differently than usual.

150
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:24,311
Maybe it was because she was smiling.

151
00:10:24,311 --> 00:10:27,111
She kept giving me drinks like she was determined.

152
00:10:40,711 --> 00:10:42,371
Then...

153
00:10:48,071 --> 00:10:50,061
- "Now, tell me the truth."
 - Now, tell me the truth.

154
00:10:50,061 --> 00:10:51,581
"How are you planning to kill me?"

155
00:10:51,581 --> 00:10:54,221
 How are you planning to kill me? 

156
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:55,821
 She asked me like that, 

157
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:59,301
and I thought she was having another delusional fit, so...

158
00:10:59,301 --> 00:11:03,201
 - Stop talking nonsense!
 - I'm going crazy because of you! 

159
00:11:03,971 --> 00:11:06,321
Just then, someone rang the doorbell.

160
00:11:11,591 --> 00:11:14,561
 Yes, it was Jang Mi Ho. 

161
00:11:14,561 --> 00:11:16,301
If it wasn't planned,

162
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:19,101
why did she come to our house that day at that hour?

163
00:11:19,101 --> 00:11:20,701
It wasn't like that!

164
00:11:20,701 --> 00:11:23,291
Ha Yool got hurt at the studio,

165
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,481
so I went to apologize!

166
00:11:25,481 --> 00:11:27,001
 Two weeks ago, during the Yu Jin's photoshoot, there was an accident? 

167
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:30,121
But wasn't Kang Ha Yool's injury two weeks prior?

168
00:11:31,101 --> 00:11:34,131
I found out late after seeing Yu Jin's social media.

169
00:11:34,131 --> 00:11:35,401
Isn't that circumstantial evidence?

170
00:11:35,401 --> 00:11:37,541
She probably came to spy on us or to give orders.

171
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:40,531
I don't know how she provoked Yu Jin, but Yu Jin became extremely agitated.

172
00:11:40,531 --> 00:11:42,691
 She went crazy, saying she'll kill everyone. 

173
00:11:42,691 --> 00:11:45,221
 And she actually pulled out a kitchen knife. 

174
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:50,871
I tried to stop her, but...

175
00:12:13,991 --> 00:12:16,331
I think she was looking for her phone.

176
00:12:18,721 --> 00:12:21,601
 Then she started to call that woman. 

177
00:12:23,531 --> 00:12:27,921
 I might've been unconscious, but I remember what she said. 

178
00:12:29,471 --> 00:12:31,421
 I knew then... 

179
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:39,181
that the two of them had plotted to kill me.

180
00:12:48,391 --> 00:12:50,631
What kind of nonsense are you spewing?

181
00:12:50,631 --> 00:12:55,171
Why would I try to kill someone I don't even know?

182
00:12:55,171 --> 00:12:59,711
Your finances aren't too good for someone who's worked at a bank for ten years.

183
00:12:59,711 --> 00:13:04,221
You're spending a lot of money on your mother's hospital bills and living expenses, right?

184
00:13:06,621 --> 00:13:09,991
Even so, I've never been short on money.

185
00:13:09,991 --> 00:13:12,791
 Real Estate Sales Contract  
Recently, your mother bought a house in Gapyeong.

186
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,561
Isn't that essentially your money?

187
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,171
And you are paying the interest for the loans.

188
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:20,071
It looks like you would be short on money.

189
00:13:20,071 --> 00:13:23,321
What does that have to do with Yu Jin?

190
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:25,211
You met her after a long time,

191
00:13:25,211 --> 00:13:27,561
and you could've been jealous since she was living it up.

192
00:13:27,561 --> 00:13:29,201
You could've gotten greedy, too.

193
00:13:29,201 --> 00:13:30,821
That never happened.

194
00:13:30,821 --> 00:13:33,941
Then why did you do so much background search on Oh Yu Jin through social media?

195
00:13:33,941 --> 00:13:35,691
Background search?

196
00:13:36,521 --> 00:13:40,111
I told you I only looked at it out of curiosity about how she was doing.

197
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:43,541
If so, you probably knew Oh Yu Jin's situation very well.

198
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:46,561
Such as her relationship with her husband or her emotional instability.

199
00:13:46,561 --> 00:13:49,281
How would I know that?

200
00:13:49,281 --> 00:13:52,821
I first heard about the kindergarten performance here from you, Detective!

201
00:13:52,821 --> 00:13:54,541
And even if I had known about that,

202
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:59,161
that's not evidence I plotted with Yu Jin to kill Kang Do Joon!

203
00:13:59,161 --> 00:14:00,801
Receiving money from her would be evidence.

204
00:14:00,801 --> 00:14:03,321
I didn't receive the money! I returned it to her!

205
00:14:03,321 --> 00:14:05,571
Then where is that money?

206
00:14:07,251 --> 00:14:09,721
Why do you keep asking me that?

207
00:14:09,721 --> 00:14:12,101
Everything you're saying right now is all assumption.

208
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:15,111
Since these are only circumstantial, you keep focusing on that money, no?

209
00:14:15,111 --> 00:14:16,931
Jang Mi Ho!

210
00:14:16,931 --> 00:14:19,791
You met Oh Yu Jin again for the first time in 18 years

211
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,341
only 30 days before the incident!

212
00:14:21,341 --> 00:14:23,471
The two of you talked on the phone before the incident,

213
00:14:23,471 --> 00:14:26,441
and you receiving the money was caught on CCTV!

214
00:14:26,441 --> 00:14:29,791
And you were near the scene at the time of the incident.

215
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:33,871
We cannot accept your explanations for this, Jang Mi Ho.

216
00:14:41,711 --> 00:14:43,111
Let's take a break.

217
00:14:43,111 --> 00:14:45,361
Then, Detective,

218
00:14:45,361 --> 00:14:47,821
can you accept everything Kang Do Joon said?

219
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:51,681
If two people were in a room and one of them died,

220
00:14:51,681 --> 00:14:54,441
shouldn't you be most suspicious of the other person?

221
00:14:54,441 --> 00:14:57,901
We are still investigating all possibilities.

222
00:14:57,901 --> 00:15:02,371
I don't know what you're trying to check that you're doing this to me.

223
00:15:02,371 --> 00:15:04,431
But I must know

224
00:15:04,431 --> 00:15:07,521
why Kang Do Joon is saying such lies.

225
00:15:12,101 --> 00:15:14,601
Are you serious? She was arrested?

226
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:17,231
- Plotting to kill Yu Jin's husband?
 - I heard it was incitement.

227
00:15:17,231 --> 00:15:18,641
What's the difference between the two?

228
00:15:18,641 --> 00:15:21,071
Either way, they plotted it together.

229
00:15:21,071 --> 00:15:24,421
So? Is that woman still at the police station?

230
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:49,421
Oh, hello, moms.

231
00:15:50,641 --> 00:15:55,811
I guess you had a good time last night. All of you look so happy.

232
00:15:55,811 --> 00:15:57,401
I'm sure you checked your notifications.

233
00:15:57,401 --> 00:16:00,721
You know there is a pajama party next month, right?

234
00:16:00,721 --> 00:16:03,151
The kids have waited a long time for this,

235
00:16:03,151 --> 00:16:06,741
so we'll need your help, moms.

236
00:16:06,741 --> 00:16:11,331
I would like for people to volunteer to help.

237
00:16:14,051 --> 00:16:17,281
This is a bit different from other times.

238
00:16:17,281 --> 00:16:18,751
Min Seong's mother?

239
00:16:18,751 --> 00:16:20,151
You ladies should take care of it.

240
00:16:20,151 --> 00:16:24,011
It's not like I always need to step up for things like this.

241
00:16:24,011 --> 00:16:29,851
Why not ask people with too much free time on their hands doing useless things?

242
00:16:33,671 --> 00:16:41,191
Still, it would be great for someone with leadership to take charge of this, as always.

243
00:17:13,211 --> 00:17:14,851
 The man who can't live without me ♥ 

244
00:17:21,971 --> 00:17:25,131
Honey, do me a favor.

245
00:17:25,131 --> 00:17:27,131
It's not easy.

246
00:17:27,131 --> 00:17:29,281
We should've brought her in last night and interrogated her.

247
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:32,171
We gave her too much time to come up with a story.

248
00:17:32,171 --> 00:17:36,651
Kang Do Joon also has a consistent testimony.

249
00:17:38,031 --> 00:17:39,961
Why is it so hard to paint a picture?

250
00:17:39,961 --> 00:17:42,951
But should we even waste our energy like this?

251
00:17:42,951 --> 00:17:45,971
It's pretty clear who is lying.

252
00:17:48,821 --> 00:17:51,121
- Who are you?
 - I came to sit in on the reference investigation.

253
00:17:51,121 --> 00:17:52,171
 Attorney Appointment Letter 

254
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:55,671
Did you check the box as soon as you received it in the teahouse?

255
00:17:58,151 --> 00:18:00,221
I am Jang Mi Ho's attorney.

256
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:04,531
Oh, I see.

257
00:18:13,831 --> 00:18:16,151
We'll continue then.

258
00:18:16,151 --> 00:18:18,641
How much was in the box?

259
00:18:18,641 --> 00:18:20,781
About 20 million won.

260
00:18:20,781 --> 00:18:23,211
That means you've checked the amount.

261
00:18:23,211 --> 00:18:24,941
You said you didn't know she'd give you money.

262
00:18:24,941 --> 00:18:27,661
But if you know the exact amount,

263
00:18:27,661 --> 00:18:30,191
doesn't that mean you arranged it with Oh Yu Jin?

264
00:18:30,191 --> 00:18:33,391
As in how much money you want and such?

265
00:18:33,391 --> 00:18:35,411
I am a bank employee.

266
00:18:35,411 --> 00:18:37,621
My job is to count money, so how would I not know?

267
00:18:37,621 --> 00:18:39,811
And besides, who would

268
00:18:39,811 --> 00:18:42,771
plot a murder for only 20 million won?

269
00:18:42,771 --> 00:18:45,021
That isn't everything.

270
00:18:45,021 --> 00:18:47,251
If Kang Do Joon dies, all of this would become Oh Yu Jin's!

271
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,411
Why are you doing this to me?

272
00:18:49,411 --> 00:18:52,561
Shouldn't you be investigating Kang Do Joon instead?

273
00:18:52,561 --> 00:18:54,361
Investigator?

274
00:18:54,361 --> 00:18:56,721
Are you interrogating her right now?

275
00:18:58,681 --> 00:19:01,441
This material witness investigation is too forceful.

276
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:04,251
Why are you conducting it as if she's a suspect?

277
00:19:04,251 --> 00:19:07,871
You don't have to say anything that may be disadvantageous to you.

278
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,311
Why would you explain yourself like that?

279
00:19:14,311 --> 00:19:16,211
You have no need for that.

280
00:19:16,211 --> 00:19:18,321
If they require you to come in again, give me a call.

281
00:19:18,321 --> 00:19:19,801
How did you know?

282
00:19:19,801 --> 00:19:21,951
My wife asked me for a favor.

283
00:19:21,951 --> 00:19:25,321
You should go home. I have to go back to work.

284
00:19:26,261 --> 00:19:29,671
Lee Tae Ho, do you know anything about this case?

285
00:19:29,671 --> 00:19:32,321
I don't know. Not really.

286
00:19:36,971 --> 00:19:39,271
I'm sorry, but can you find out more about it?

287
00:19:39,271 --> 00:19:41,201
Please?

288
00:19:41,201 --> 00:19:44,701
I came to do only this much for you. You should ask someone else.

289
00:19:44,701 --> 00:19:48,601
Then, tell me what kind of person Kang Do Joon is. You must know him very well.

290
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:51,171
I don't want to get involved in those matters.

291
00:19:51,171 --> 00:19:52,671
I'm leaving.

292
00:20:42,621 --> 00:20:47,141
You couldn't arrest or put her in jail? Does that make sense?

293
00:20:47,141 --> 00:20:48,831
I told you already.

294
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:51,311
She doesn't meet the requirements for arrest.

295
00:20:51,311 --> 00:20:53,721
They won't give us a warrant with what we have so far.

296
00:20:53,721 --> 00:20:57,541
This is why people don't trust public authorities.

297
00:20:57,541 --> 00:21:00,701
How could you release someone who incited murder in plain view?

298
00:21:00,701 --> 00:21:04,651
Kang Do Joon, we will take care of the investigation.

299
00:21:04,651 --> 00:21:10,181
 Just know that we haven't cleared anyone off the suspect list for now. 

300
00:21:26,261 --> 00:21:29,281
Their grandfather took them as soon as school was out.

301
00:21:29,281 --> 00:21:31,611
Didn't you get a call from him?

302
00:21:31,611 --> 00:21:33,751
I am currently their legal guardian.

303
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:36,441
How could you not let me know about this?

304
00:21:38,721 --> 00:21:42,781
It appears there was a miscommunication. I'll give him a call.

305
00:21:42,781 --> 00:21:46,301
 Kang Bong Seok - Yu Jin's father-in-law 

306
00:21:46,301 --> 00:21:51,251
 You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep, and there will be an additional charge. 

307
00:21:51,251 --> 00:21:52,431
This is Jang Mi Ho.

308
00:21:52,431 --> 00:21:55,271
How could you change the passcode and take the kids without telling me?

309
00:21:55,271 --> 00:21:57,051
Please give me a call back quickly.

310
00:21:58,381 --> 00:22:02,111
Ji Yool, Ha Yool! Are you home?

311
00:22:02,111 --> 00:22:04,941
If you're home, say something!

312
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:08,391
Ji Yool!

313
00:22:43,871 --> 00:22:46,291
 If so, you probably knew Oh Yu Jin's situation very well. 

314
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:49,911
 Such as her relationship with her husband or her emotional instability. 

315
00:22:54,611 --> 00:22:57,891
 The unfolding story of the Bannae-dong couple murder case 

316
00:23:02,861 --> 00:23:04,611
 Investigating under the assumption that it was a fight between the couple. 

317
00:23:04,611 --> 00:23:05,961
 Copy, paste 

318
00:23:07,321 --> 00:23:11,001
 Investigating under the assumption that it was a fight between the couple. 

319
00:23:13,241 --> 00:23:17,571
 Planning to summon those related to the case for further investigation for exact circumstances. 

320
00:23:26,451 --> 00:23:29,691
 ooo_yoojin 

321
00:23:32,561 --> 00:23:35,651
 Just keep smiling brightly like this for me, my princesses. 

322
00:23:35,651 --> 00:23:38,511
 Mommy loves you so much! 

323
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:58,311
Let me look.

324
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,101
Goodness...

325
00:24:06,341 --> 00:24:07,821
Great work yesterday.

326
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,211
When did you make up with that woman?

327
00:24:09,211 --> 00:24:11,731
We never fought. I just

328
00:24:11,731 --> 00:24:15,191
thought it'd be good to have her owe me something.

329
00:24:16,101 --> 00:24:19,401
- Are you coming home late again tonight?
 - Yeah. Work is busy.

330
00:24:29,281 --> 00:24:31,581
- I'll be going.
 - Honey.

331
00:24:31,581 --> 00:24:34,461
I think we'll need to hire a new nanny.

332
00:24:34,461 --> 00:24:37,591
Why? She has taken care of Ah Rin for a long time.

333
00:24:37,591 --> 00:24:41,071
Her commute is too far since she moved into her son's house.

334
00:24:41,071 --> 00:24:42,371
Do you have anyone in mind?

335
00:24:42,371 --> 00:24:44,611
- Yeah.
 - Okay, do as you please.

336
00:24:44,611 --> 00:24:46,471
Take care.

337
00:24:57,161 --> 00:24:59,501
 aara_joara 

338
00:25:03,881 --> 00:25:05,451
 Ms. Jo Ah Ra 

339
00:25:12,101 --> 00:25:16,551
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep... 

340
00:25:24,631 --> 00:25:27,711
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail... 

341
00:25:28,781 --> 00:25:31,091
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail... 

342
00:25:31,091 --> 00:25:32,711
 Kang Bong Seok (Yu Jin's father-in-law) 

343
00:25:38,801 --> 00:25:41,081
Refusal of visitation?

344
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,961
Kang Do Joon isn't in critical condition, right?

345
00:25:42,961 --> 00:25:47,171
It's not that. But if the patient refuses visitation, you can't see him.

346
00:25:56,851 --> 00:25:58,261
 Father 

347
00:26:04,991 --> 00:26:07,741
 I don't know if this is the right thing to do. 

348
00:26:07,741 --> 00:26:10,151
 The kids are looking for their aunt. 

349
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:13,771
 You'll need to get discharged soon and come quickly. 

350
00:26:14,721 --> 00:26:16,101
 I will be discharged soon. 

351
00:26:16,101 --> 00:26:18,941
 I'll go after I take care of one important thing. 

352
00:26:25,241 --> 00:26:26,541
 Kim Na Yeong (Ah Rin's mother) 

353
00:26:28,081 --> 00:26:29,721
Yes?

354
00:26:33,781 --> 00:26:35,161
Yes.

355
00:26:36,601 --> 00:26:38,711
Right now?

356
00:26:38,711 --> 00:26:41,381
Okay. I'll go down.

357
00:27:13,821 --> 00:27:15,531
I'll do it.

358
00:27:27,991 --> 00:27:30,371
I should have thanked you first.

359
00:27:30,371 --> 00:27:31,961
I'm a little late.

360
00:27:31,961 --> 00:27:33,261
You don't need to thank me.

361
00:27:33,261 --> 00:27:35,511
I did it because I got mad.

362
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:42,501
But what favor do you have to ask of me?

363
00:27:45,821 --> 00:27:48,491
You know Ms. Jo Ah Ra's contact info, right?

364
00:27:48,491 --> 00:27:51,761
Please set up a meeting with her and don't mention me.

365
00:27:53,721 --> 00:27:56,641
Maybe she blocked my number. I can't reach her.

366
00:27:56,641 --> 00:28:01,581
I must meet with that woman.

367
00:28:03,601 --> 00:28:05,801
Okay, I'll do that.

368
00:28:10,991 --> 00:28:13,281
Then could I ask you something too?

369
00:28:13,281 --> 00:28:15,741
Kang Do Joon said that?

370
00:28:15,741 --> 00:28:18,161
Since only two of them were at home that day,

371
00:28:18,161 --> 00:28:21,751
he probably thought he'd be suspected.

372
00:28:21,751 --> 00:28:23,951
He could have insisted it was in self-defense.

373
00:28:23,951 --> 00:28:28,201
I don't understand why he placed the blame on me.

374
00:28:29,681 --> 00:28:31,761
I wonder what happened before she died.

375
00:28:31,761 --> 00:28:33,611
 Mi Ho. 

376
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:36,261
 She looked perfectly fine in the studio, 

377
00:28:36,261 --> 00:28:38,851
but when I saw her that day...

378
00:28:43,081 --> 00:28:46,801
How could a person change so drastically like that?

379
00:28:46,801 --> 00:28:49,591
What happened in the span of those two weeks?

380
00:28:49,591 --> 00:28:51,601
I don't really know what happens in her home, either.

381
00:28:51,601 --> 00:28:54,461
Please tell me what you do know.

382
00:28:57,901 --> 00:29:01,101
- About the three of us being like that— 
- I know.

383
00:29:04,281 --> 00:29:07,101
After what happened at the performance,

384
00:29:07,101 --> 00:29:09,191
I spread some bad rumors.

385
00:29:09,191 --> 00:29:13,111
Such as Ji Yool and Ha Yool's parents might be abusing them.

386
00:29:13,111 --> 00:29:16,111
So, Yu Jin was furious.

387
00:29:17,211 --> 00:29:19,011
 They're so pretty! 

388
00:29:19,011 --> 00:29:20,521
 They were made for you, Na Yeong. 

389
00:29:20,521 --> 00:29:22,381
 They look good on you. 

390
00:29:22,381 --> 00:29:24,891
 She acted like nothing happened. 

391
00:29:26,061 --> 00:29:28,251
But she was just pretending,

392
00:29:28,251 --> 00:29:32,611
and she attacked my husband and Jeong Ah's company on social media.

393
00:29:32,611 --> 00:29:36,021
Jeong Ah got very angry about that.

394
00:29:37,281 --> 00:29:41,631
Then, one day, she said to me...

395
00:29:43,351 --> 00:29:44,601
 Just stay put. 

396
00:29:44,601 --> 00:29:48,561
 I'll find out that bitch's weakness, no matter what. 

397
00:29:48,561 --> 00:29:52,081
 I was so caught up with my husband that I had forgotten about it. 

398
00:29:56,191 --> 00:29:59,261
 I found something interesting. 

399
00:29:59,261 --> 00:30:01,111
 What is that 

400
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:06,481
I don't know. She didn't tell me.

401
00:30:07,971 --> 00:30:09,711
Maybe it was because of that.

402
00:30:09,711 --> 00:30:14,731
Yu Jin behaved very strangely for a while, right before she died.

403
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:17,551
I heard she even caused a scene at the kindergarten.

404
00:30:17,551 --> 00:30:20,471
I think she ripped up the children's drawings or something.

405
00:30:20,471 --> 00:30:23,621
Could it be that Song Jeong Ah hired someone to find her weakness

406
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:26,131
and threatened Yu Jin with it?

407
00:30:26,131 --> 00:30:29,081
And that weakness might have to do with Kang Do Joon.

408
00:30:29,081 --> 00:30:30,741
I wouldn't know.

409
00:30:36,971 --> 00:30:39,161
Only Jeong Ah would know.

410
00:30:40,221 --> 00:30:41,611
 Inner-Spirit 2023 - A Plan to host an investment presentation 

411
00:30:43,571 --> 00:30:46,071
President Jeong of Gerentice will be absent.

412
00:30:46,071 --> 00:30:48,821
They're trying to pull out completely.

413
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:51,181
What's the problem?

414
00:30:51,181 --> 00:30:55,481
After diligently taking 20% of my earnings per share...

415
00:30:55,481 --> 00:30:57,911
There aren't any weird rumors out there, are there?

416
00:30:57,911 --> 00:30:59,901
No, there aren't.

417
00:31:00,981 --> 00:31:04,211
Speak to the other investors so they aren't shaken by this.

418
00:31:04,211 --> 00:31:05,821
Understood.

419
00:31:11,231 --> 00:31:12,551
 Manager Gong Chang Hyeon 

420
00:31:19,571 --> 00:31:22,051
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail... 

421
00:31:23,811 --> 00:31:27,101
 On the day Yu Jin died, at the time the incident took place, 

422
00:31:27,101 --> 00:31:32,011
 I saw a man enter into building 151. 

423
00:31:32,011 --> 00:31:35,471
 He has nothing to do with Oh Yu Jin's death. 

424
00:31:35,471 --> 00:31:38,491
 I called him to my house for a personal matter that day. 

425
00:31:38,491 --> 00:31:40,111
 You're lying again. 

426
00:31:40,111 --> 00:31:42,291
 You said you had a family gathering that day. 

427
00:31:42,291 --> 00:31:45,591
 I heard that's what you testified to the police. Isn't that true? 

428
00:31:56,231 --> 00:31:59,571
 December 5th, 2022. The day of Oh Yu Jin's death. 

429
00:32:01,381 --> 00:32:02,821
Geez!

430
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:06,481
I have no idea how many drugs he took. He's completely out of it.

431
00:32:06,481 --> 00:32:08,031
It could've been bad. I barely managed to bring him here.

432
00:32:08,031 --> 00:32:10,891
- What about videos?
 - I took care of the uploaded ones,

433
00:32:10,891 --> 00:32:14,771
but we'll have to bribe the kids who have them on their phones.

434
00:32:42,111 --> 00:32:43,711
 Where is Su Bin? 

435
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:45,051
 I don't know. 

436
00:32:45,051 --> 00:32:47,481
 Where did that guy go? 

437
00:33:08,841 --> 00:33:10,151
 Youngest brother-in-law Song Jeong Sik 

438
00:33:12,721 --> 00:33:14,521
What is this, Brother-in-law?

439
00:33:14,521 --> 00:33:16,711
Your noona said to keep your phone off.

440
00:33:16,711 --> 00:33:18,931
How would she know anyway?

441
00:33:18,931 --> 00:33:21,041
 Did you buy the coffee? 

442
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:22,541
Yeah, I bought it.

443
00:33:22,541 --> 00:33:24,431
 You didn't buy the convenience store coffee, right? 

444
00:33:24,431 --> 00:33:27,731
- What?
 -  Hey, Jeong Su Bin, are you kidding me? 

445
00:33:27,731 --> 00:33:30,101
Don't you know I only drink the coffee from the Cheongdam cafe?

446
00:33:30,101 --> 00:33:33,101
The one with no bean acidity with an extra shot.

447
00:33:37,201 --> 00:33:41,561
Well, the thing is, it's a bit difficult to go all the way there—

448
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:44,601
 Brother-in-law, should I call Noona right now? 

449
00:33:45,401 --> 00:33:47,311
 Shall I expose everything? 

450
00:33:48,311 --> 00:33:50,541
 I have nothing to lose. 

451
00:33:53,371 --> 00:33:55,681
Okay, I got it.

452
00:33:55,681 --> 00:33:56,901
 Hurry up. 

453
00:33:56,901 --> 00:34:00,461
 I have a headache because I haven't had any caffeine. 

454

Director...

456
00:34:31,551 --> 00:34:32,791
Give me the office key.

457
00:34:32,791 --> 00:34:34,151
Pardon?

458
00:34:34,151 --> 00:34:37,871
Oh, the door is open.

459
00:34:39,251 --> 00:34:40,571
Why?

460
00:34:40,571 --> 00:34:41,721
Oh, well...

461
00:34:41,721 --> 00:34:43,111
Answer me!

462
00:34:43,111 --> 00:34:46,751
This morning, the cleaning lady was cleaning inside.

Hello. Dr. Kang Do Joon works here, right?

472
00:36:34,221 --> 00:36:36,721
The Director only stopped by for a moment,

473
00:36:36,721 --> 00:36:39,111
so it would be difficult for him to treat you today.

474
00:36:39,111 --> 00:36:42,091
Kang Do Joon is here right now?

475
00:36:55,271 --> 00:37:00,791
Director, some woman was looking for you earlier.

476
00:37:06,671 --> 00:37:07,761
Who?

477
00:37:07,761 --> 00:37:10,371
She said you would know.

478
00:37:44,281 --> 00:37:46,701
The rooftop is okay for you, right?

479
00:38:08,561 --> 00:38:12,341
I went to visit you, but you refused to see me.

480
00:38:13,881 --> 00:38:16,141
There's no reason for me to meet with you.

481
00:38:16,141 --> 00:38:18,111
What would I have to hear from you?

482
00:38:18,111 --> 00:38:20,781
Why did you tell the police that?

483
00:38:20,781 --> 00:38:22,951
What do you mean by aiding and abetting murder?

484
00:38:24,121 --> 00:38:26,581
How could you make up something like that?

485
00:38:28,901 --> 00:38:31,151
Soliciting murder...

486
00:38:35,051 --> 00:38:36,361
That's how things ended up, I see.

487
00:38:36,361 --> 00:38:38,781
Why do you act like you don't know? You said it!

488
00:38:38,781 --> 00:38:42,641
That's not true. I only said what happened.

489
00:38:42,641 --> 00:38:44,921
The police came to their own conclusion.

490
00:38:44,921 --> 00:38:47,011
You intended it.

491
00:38:47,011 --> 00:38:48,991
Why would you frame me with such nonsense?

492
00:38:48,991 --> 00:38:53,031
Didn't you lie because you had something to hide?

493
00:38:53,921 --> 00:38:56,331
This is absolutely ridiculous. Sh*t.

494
00:38:56,331 --> 00:39:00,561
So, did you come to argue with me?

495
00:39:00,561 --> 00:39:02,541
This was all your fault.

496
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:05,731
This was all your plotting!

497
00:39:05,731 --> 00:39:07,551
Yu Jin died because of you.

498
00:39:07,551 --> 00:39:10,941
Thanks to you, my life is a mess, and I can't even see my kids!

499
00:39:10,941 --> 00:39:12,991
And you're telling me I'm lying?

500
00:39:13,971 --> 00:39:18,281
I am currently restraining myself to the best I can.

501
00:39:19,411 --> 00:39:23,761
Kang Do Joon, you don't truly believe what you just said, right?

502
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:25,321
Why?

503
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,571
So you can say I'm crazy, too?

504
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,921
I won't let you off.

505
00:39:30,921 --> 00:39:37,151
I will make sure you pay for what you did.

506
00:40:37,691 --> 00:40:39,531
 Cheers! 

507
00:40:39,531 --> 00:40:41,271
 Do you hear us toasting? 

508
00:40:41,271 --> 00:40:42,941
Why did you call me?

509
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:46,461
I called to do a countdown for the day of your return!

510
00:40:46,461 --> 00:40:48,161
Ms. Jang, come back quickly.

511
00:40:48,161 --> 00:40:49,811
Go away.

512
00:40:49,811 --> 00:40:52,741
 No one at work misunderstands you now, 

513
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:54,481
 so put your mind at ease and come back, okay? 

514
00:40:54,481 --> 00:40:56,921
 Wrap everything up and come back with your mind at ease. 

515
00:40:56,921 --> 00:41:00,581
Okay. I'm hanging up.

516
00:41:10,681 --> 00:41:13,981
 ooo_yoojin 

517
00:41:13,981 --> 00:41:16,731
 My lovely angels right next to me. 

518
00:41:16,731 --> 00:41:19,131
 This must be heaven. 

519
00:41:19,131 --> 00:41:22,381
We didn't even get to take a photo together.

520
00:41:33,441 --> 00:41:35,471
  
 Thank you for setting up a meeting with her for me. 

521
00:41:35,471 --> 00:41:38,461
 I'll go alone to the meeting tomorrow. 

522
00:42:04,741 --> 00:42:07,861
- Welcome. I'll guide you inside this way. 
 - Okay

523
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,330
 Haru Scalp 

524
00:42:13,101 --> 00:42:18,451
Then, I will proceed with a solution for a sensitive scalp.

525
00:42:18,451 --> 00:42:21,541
I have a really important meeting,

526
00:42:21,541 --> 00:42:23,321
so please take extra care.

527
00:42:23,321 --> 00:42:24,901
Yes, will do.

528
00:42:24,901 --> 00:42:27,911
Oh, by chance, do you have children?

529
00:42:27,911 --> 00:42:30,101
We also provide kids' care.

530
00:42:30,101 --> 00:42:31,541
Oh, really?

531
00:42:31,541 --> 00:42:33,921
Then I'll come with Ah Rin sometime.

532
00:42:33,921 --> 00:42:35,601
She's my daughter.

533
00:42:57,221 --> 00:43:00,571
The children's grandfather made a request of us.

534
00:43:00,571 --> 00:43:02,651
I just want to see the kids' faces.

535
00:43:02,651 --> 00:43:05,241
I am worried about whether they are doing okay.

536
00:43:05,961 --> 00:43:08,711
I will go and ask the principal.

537
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:14,210
 Herinity English Kindergarten 

538
00:43:26,431 --> 00:43:28,511
It's Ji Yool's class.

539
00:43:30,891 --> 00:43:35,651
Ji Yool is Ella. Ella...

540
00:43:38,801 --> 00:43:42,661
Huh? I'm sure she's in Gold Class.

541
00:43:43,651 --> 00:43:46,321
Why is Ji Yool's picture not here?

542
00:43:49,871 --> 00:43:55,241
Well, the Principal said that would be difficult...

543
00:43:55,241 --> 00:43:57,961
Oh, I see.

544
00:43:57,961 --> 00:44:02,571
But why is Ji Yool's picture not here?

545
00:44:02,571 --> 00:44:04,531
You don't know?

546
00:44:04,531 --> 00:44:06,641
Ji Yool doesn't draw pictures.

547
00:44:06,641 --> 00:44:08,091
What?

548
00:44:08,091 --> 00:44:09,921
When was it that she stopped again?

549
00:44:09,921 --> 00:44:13,211
In any case, she doesn't draw pictures anymore.

550
00:44:16,941 --> 00:44:19,041
 Draw a rabbit here for me. 

551
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:22,361
 I don't want to. I don't draw pictures. 

552
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:26,211
 I heard she even caused a scene at the kindergarten. 

553
00:44:26,211 --> 00:44:29,451
 I think she ripped up the children's drawings or something... 

554
00:44:29,451 --> 00:44:31,401
By chance, did Yu Jin—

555
00:44:31,401 --> 00:44:34,531
Did Oh Yu Jin ever cause a scene at the kindergarten?

556
00:44:34,531 --> 00:44:37,381
I heard she ripped up the children's drawings.

557
00:44:41,601 --> 00:44:44,981
Ma'am, what's wrong? If you tell me, I can—

558
00:44:44,981 --> 00:44:46,831
Let go!

559
00:44:46,831 --> 00:44:50,381
If you calm down and take a seat, I'll find Ella's for you.

560
00:44:50,381 --> 00:44:51,331
 Ella 

561
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:06,041
Ma'am!

562
00:45:06,041 --> 00:45:08,101
 She ripped the drawing off the classroom wall, 

563
00:45:08,101 --> 00:45:10,631
 and took Ji Yool's sketchbook as well. 

564
00:45:10,631 --> 00:45:12,141
Why?

565
00:45:12,621 --> 00:45:16,841
I'm not sure. I don't really know.

566
00:45:48,561 --> 00:45:49,621
Can I take your order?

567
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:51,371
A coffee...

568
00:45:52,811 --> 00:45:54,331
Actually, I'll take a strawberry juice.

569
00:45:54,331 --> 00:45:56,391
- It's fresh fruit, right?
 - Yes.

570
00:46:09,761 --> 00:46:11,851
Ms. Jo, it's been so long!

571
00:46:11,851 --> 00:46:14,161
Have you been well?

572
00:46:15,371 --> 00:46:17,831
- Yes.
 - You're surprised, right?

573
00:46:17,831 --> 00:46:19,971
I wanted to meet you so badly, but I couldn't reach you.

574
00:46:19,971 --> 00:46:22,661
So I asked a favor of Mi Ho.

575
00:46:24,721 --> 00:46:28,171
Oh, and this is a gift for you.

576
00:46:28,171 --> 00:46:30,051
To celebrate your resignation.

577
00:46:31,271 --> 00:46:33,391
Thank you.

578
00:46:33,391 --> 00:46:35,991
I couldn't reach you at all, so

579
00:46:35,991 --> 00:46:40,511
I thought you cut off all contact with all the moms at Herinity.

580
00:46:41,601 --> 00:46:45,161
But I understand.

581
00:46:45,161 --> 00:46:49,241
You wanted to wrap up everything cleanly.

582
00:46:49,241 --> 00:46:52,681
Thank you for understanding.

583
00:46:55,331 --> 00:47:00,261
But I should have said goodbye to you personally, Mrs. Kim.

584
00:47:00,261 --> 00:47:03,821
I was grateful to you for many things.

585
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:06,421
I also had much to repay you for on multiple fronts,

586
00:47:06,421 --> 00:47:09,861
so I really wanted to meet you again.

587
00:47:11,421 --> 00:47:14,321
What are you doing now after quitting kindergarten?

588
00:47:15,761 --> 00:47:17,681
I am taking a break.

589
00:47:17,681 --> 00:47:21,541
I'll take my time and think about what I want to do.

590
00:47:23,221 --> 00:47:26,851
Then I want to make you an offer.

591
00:47:26,851 --> 00:47:30,841
Could you be a nanny to my Ah Rin?

592
00:47:30,841 --> 00:47:34,011
- Pardon?
 - My current nanny suddenly quit,

593
00:47:34,011 --> 00:47:37,581
so I'm trying to hire someone, but it's not easy.

594
00:47:37,581 --> 00:47:43,111
You know it's difficult to find someone you can trust.

595
00:47:43,111 --> 00:47:45,911
Since Ah Rin really likes you, Ms. Jo.

596
00:47:47,681 --> 00:47:51,121
Well, I mean, I was pretty close to Ah Rin.

597
00:47:51,121 --> 00:47:55,381
What do you think about taking care of my Ah Rin?

598
00:47:55,381 --> 00:47:58,161
I'll need to think about it a bit.

599
00:47:58,161 --> 00:48:01,011
I'll look forward to a positive answer from you.

600
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:04,611
But Ms. Jo, you don't seem to be eating much.

601
00:48:05,611 --> 00:48:08,851
My stomach isn't feeling well these days.

602
00:48:08,851 --> 00:48:11,811
It looks like you haven't eaten much, either, Ms. Kim.

603
00:48:11,811 --> 00:48:14,541
My stomach isn't feeling well these days, either.

604
00:48:16,271 --> 00:48:17,921
Goodbye.

605
00:48:17,921 --> 00:48:20,051
Great work today.

606
00:48:20,051 --> 00:48:21,531
Goodbye.

607
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:23,671
Goodbye.

608
00:48:25,681 --> 00:48:29,631
How about having the kids play in the playground? It's been a while.

609
00:48:29,631 --> 00:48:32,231
Ji Yool and Ha Yool, do you want to go, too?

610
00:48:37,131 --> 00:48:39,151
Oh, okay.

611
00:48:39,151 --> 00:48:41,851
Let's go together.

612
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:47,561
She wouldn't do it for me, you know.

613
00:48:49,021 --> 00:48:51,001
We got past it, but...

614
00:48:53,841 --> 00:48:57,761
- But I— 
- Oh, one second. Sorry.

615
00:49:00,091 --> 00:49:01,951
You must have something else to attend to.

616
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:04,131
Oh, yes, you're right.

617
00:49:04,131 --> 00:49:05,881
If you have to go, go ahead.

618
00:49:05,881 --> 00:49:09,041
I'll bring the kids later.

619
00:49:09,041 --> 00:49:11,981
Then I leave them in your care.

620
00:49:18,821 --> 00:49:23,231
Kids, do you want to go eat carp bread pastries with Auntie?

621
00:49:24,111 --> 00:49:27,811
Why not? Ji Yool and Ha Yool, you guys like carp bread pastries.

622
00:49:28,741 --> 00:49:30,811
I don't want to eat it.

623
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:38,161
Then should we go see Mommy's tree?

624
00:49:38,161 --> 00:49:40,541
The tree we planted last time.

625
00:49:47,641 --> 00:49:50,951
Wait, Mommy's tree is that way.

626
00:49:50,951 --> 00:49:53,001
Ji Yool, just a second.

627
00:49:57,561 --> 00:49:59,261
Surprise!

628
00:49:59,261 --> 00:50:02,181
- Auntie!
 - Auntie!

629
00:50:03,711 --> 00:50:05,801
My little sweeties, have you been well?

630
00:50:05,801 --> 00:50:09,591
Auntie, where were you?

631
00:50:09,591 --> 00:50:11,441
Why didn't you come to me?

632
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:14,721
I kept waiting for you.

633
00:50:14,721 --> 00:50:18,091
Sorry. Auntie was wrong.

634
00:50:22,231 --> 00:50:24,901
Ha Yool got hurt here.

635
00:50:24,901 --> 00:50:27,451
Where? Aigoo.

636
00:50:28,431 --> 00:50:31,941
Mi Ho, let's talk somewhere else.

637
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:38,461
I don't know...

638
00:50:38,461 --> 00:50:42,901
I only know as much as other moms about Yu Jin and her husband.

639
00:50:42,901 --> 00:50:45,631
Still, do you have anything in particular you remember?

640
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:49,781
There were just the stereotypical harmonious and happy couple.

641
00:50:49,781 --> 00:50:53,551
However, it seemed like Yu Jin made most of the decisions and took charge.

642
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:57,821
Na Yeong said Yu Jin didn't seem quite right before she died.

643
00:50:57,821 --> 00:51:00,451
She did seem to be in a bad state.

644
00:51:00,451 --> 00:51:03,521
Could there have been something between her and her husband?

645
00:51:03,521 --> 00:51:06,421
Didn't Yu Jin confide in you about any of her concerns, Seong Hui?

646
00:51:06,421 --> 00:51:08,941
Goodness, of course not!

647
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:12,781
Yu Jin would rather die than tell me something like that.

648
00:51:14,011 --> 00:51:16,801
Her relationship with me was just as an acquaintance.

649
00:51:16,801 --> 00:51:19,431
We weren't even that close.

650
00:51:23,151 --> 00:51:26,491
Oh, right. There's a place Yu Jin might have shared things.

651
00:51:26,491 --> 00:51:30,911
- Where?
 - You're a member of the Trinity 99, right?

652
00:51:32,031 --> 00:51:36,401
 Mi Ho, won't you join Trinity 99? 

653
00:51:36,401 --> 00:51:38,281
 I will recommend you. 

654
00:51:42,351 --> 00:51:44,791
The anonymous bulletin board there.

655
00:51:44,791 --> 00:51:48,891
So if she was going to cheat, she should've cheated quietly by herself.

656
00:51:48,891 --> 00:51:52,701
Why tell others her embarrassing secrets and cause this mess?

657
00:51:52,701 --> 00:51:57,351
Why doesn't she know the moment she tells someone, it's no longer a secret?

658
00:51:57,351 --> 00:51:58,801
I know, right?

659
00:51:58,801 --> 00:52:02,471
In the end, it's about someone else. Even if you told them not to tell,

660
00:52:02,471 --> 00:52:05,801
could they keep such a juicy secret to themselves?

661
00:52:08,351 --> 00:52:10,801
Isn't that why we need a bamboo forest*? 
 *(Idiom for a place to vent secrets privately.)

662
00:52:10,801 --> 00:52:14,191
Rather than tell someone your secrets to get advice,

663
00:52:14,191 --> 00:52:16,931
it's better to post it on the anonymous bulletin board.

664
00:52:21,311 --> 00:52:24,431
That anonymous bulletin board is not just any bulletin board.

665
00:52:24,431 --> 00:52:28,851
A psychiatrist even provides consultations by Q&amp;A.

666
00:52:28,851 --> 00:52:32,661
If Yu Jin really had a huge, unspeakable secret,

667
00:52:32,661 --> 00:52:35,891
she would have shared it there, not with us.

668
00:52:39,681 --> 00:52:41,421
 My husband's actions at the golf range / My husband's actions were weird when we went hiking on the weekend... 

669
00:52:41,421 --> 00:52:43,371
 I want to kill my husband / I need consultation regarding an elementary school child's education... 

670
00:52:43,371 --> 00:52:46,371
 I want to kill my husband 

671
00:52:50,611 --> 00:52:56,601
Auntie, you're coming home with me, right?

672
00:52:58,031 --> 00:53:01,081
I don't know. I don't think I can.

673
00:53:01,081 --> 00:53:07,261
In return, I'll do my best so that you guys can see me whenever you want.

674
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:11,891
But Ji Yool,

675
00:53:11,891 --> 00:53:14,291
how come you don't draw pictures?

676
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:17,281
I don't think I've ever seen you draw pictures before.

677
00:53:18,311 --> 00:53:23,181
I heard you used to really like to draw, Ji Yool.

678
00:53:23,181 --> 00:53:25,851
Mommy told me not to draw.

679
00:53:25,851 --> 00:53:28,071
- Why?
 - I don't know.

680
00:53:32,701 --> 00:53:34,191
Let's go.

681
00:53:34,191 --> 00:53:37,601
Auntie Seong Hui will take you to Grandpa.

682
00:53:37,601 --> 00:53:40,361
Let's meet again next time, okay?

683
00:53:42,031 --> 00:53:43,371
Let's go.

684
00:53:45,361 --> 00:53:46,671
Let's go.

685
00:54:12,271 --> 00:54:13,921
Yes, Dad.

686
00:54:15,181 --> 00:54:18,301
I've got one more thing I need to take care of.

687
00:54:18,301 --> 00:54:22,911
I should find the evidence somehow and put that woman, Jang Mi Ho, in jail.

688
00:54:22,911 --> 00:54:26,551
What could be more important to me right now than that?

689
00:55:23,341 --> 00:55:25,491
Why are things so spectacular for you?

690
00:55:25,491 --> 00:55:28,821
It's hard for me to follow along with your story, assistant manager Jang.

691
00:55:28,821 --> 00:55:29,961
Yeah, I know.

692
00:55:29,961 --> 00:55:32,341
So, how much of the anonymous bulletin board have you looked at?

693
00:55:32,341 --> 00:55:34,661
The ones that came up in the last three months

694
00:55:34,661 --> 00:55:36,971
with a keyword search of "husband."

695
00:55:36,971 --> 00:55:38,581
 How many are there? 

696
00:55:40,401 --> 00:55:43,691
Around thirty?

697
00:55:43,691 --> 00:55:44,971
 It's not that many. 

698
00:55:44,971 --> 00:55:47,001
 You'll find it really quickly, Assistant Manager Jang. 

699
00:55:47,001 --> 00:55:50,021
 You've looked at Oh Yu Jin's SNS hundreds of times all this time. 

700
00:55:50,021 --> 00:55:52,901
I'm sure you can tell which one is hers.

701
00:55:52,901 --> 00:55:55,741
It's here. I'll hang up first today.

702
00:56:00,491 --> 00:56:02,291
 I want to kill my husband 

703
00:56:02,291 --> 00:56:06,931
"Seriously, I really want to tear him to pieces and kill him.

704
00:56:06,931 --> 00:56:09,701
That son of a bitch of a husband—"

705
00:56:12,611 --> 00:56:14,851
 I think my husband has another woman 

706
00:56:14,851 --> 00:56:17,641
"I really feel like I'll go crazy from frustration.

707
00:56:17,641 --> 00:56:21,021
I don't know who to talk to."

708
00:56:26,811 --> 00:56:29,921
"I thought all of them lived a happy life..."

709
00:56:29,921 --> 00:56:31,711
 My husband's behavior at the golf range / My husband's behavior was weird when we went hiking on the weekend... 

710
00:56:50,501 --> 00:56:52,221
 If I find a strange video on my husband's laptop 

711
00:56:54,221 --> 00:56:58,091
 If I find a strange video on my husband's laptop 

712
00:56:58,091 --> 00:57:03,231
"If I find a strange video n my husband's laptop..."

713
00:57:14,991 --> 00:57:17,431
"Even as I write this, I am trying my best to stay calm,

714
00:57:17,431 --> 00:57:21,341
yet, my hands can't help but tremble."

715
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:27,021
"In the video, my husband was

716
00:57:27,021 --> 00:57:31,531
engaging in some kind of weird play."

717
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:33,131
You have a baby face.

718
00:57:33,131 --> 00:57:35,211
I hear that often.

719
00:57:36,581 --> 00:57:38,851
 In the video, my husband had sex with that person... I am so disgusted by him. 

720
00:57:38,851 --> 00:57:40,191
 ooo_yoojin 

721
00:57:40,191 --> 00:57:43,751
 'Angels' ... 'Heaven' ... 'Sniped' ...  'Always' 

722
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:46,971
 The single quotation Yu Jin used in every post. 

723
00:57:46,971 --> 00:57:49,151
 It's Yu Jin's habit. 

724
00:57:51,171 --> 00:57:53,171
 I think my child... 

725
00:57:54,701 --> 00:57:56,511
Did you come prepared?

726
00:58:09,701 --> 00:58:12,061
 Don't hit me! 

727
00:58:25,471 --> 00:58:26,961
Get ready.

728
00:58:28,381 --> 00:58:32,821
 It's a video that was shocking even for me, but I think my child saw it. 

729
00:58:36,411 --> 00:58:42,411
♫  A page stained with lies  ♫

730
00:58:42,411 --> 00:58:48,021
♫  There is no truth there  ♫

731
00:58:48,021 --> 00:58:55,291
♫  Every moment is growing faint  ♫

732
00:58:55,291 --> 00:59:01,031
♫  A game full of confusion  ♫

733
00:59:01,031 --> 00:59:07,201
♫  Something's wrong, open my closed eyes  ♫

734
00:59:07,201 --> 00:59:13,931
♫  It's over, can't hide it anymore  ♫

735
00:59:13,931 --> 00:59:20,531
♫  The broken trust, the hidden anxieties  ♫

736
00:59:20,531 --> 00:59:23,811
 Battle For Happiness 

737
00:59:24,471 --> 00:59:26,231
 Can you get it done by tomorrow? 

738
00:59:26,231 --> 00:59:27,881
 Please take care of it as soon as possible. 

739
00:59:27,881 --> 00:59:31,031
 If you have time, could I meet with you sometime? 

740
00:59:32,791 --> 00:59:34,981
 What is this place for? 

741
00:59:34,981 --> 00:59:38,441
 You said you were curious about what Kang Do Joon did. 

742
00:59:38,441 --> 00:59:42,021
 Don't you want to find out what he did in there? 

743
00:59:42,021 --> 00:59:44,261
 You know Jeong Sik's car accident case. 

744
00:59:44,261 --> 00:59:47,731
 Could you testify that you were the one driving? 

745
00:59:47,731 --> 00:59:49,631
 Please do me this favor. 

746
00:59:51,461 --> 00:59:54,791
 You know, Kang Do Joon's tastes. 

747
00:59:57,161 --> 01:00:00,451
 CEO, I think you need to take a look at this... 

748
01:00:01,241 --> 01:00:05,471
 You crazy bastard, do you know what just happened? 

749
01:00:11,031 --> 01:00:13,971
 What are you getting so scared of already? 

750
01:00:15,581 --> 01:00:18,971
 I unlocked the password. Come and pick it up. 

751
01:00:18,971 --> 01:00:19,931
 Kang Do Joon 

752
01:00:21,851 --> 01:00:25,921
♫  I can't hide it anymore  ♫

753
01:00:25,921 --> 01:00:29,547
♫  The broken trust...  ♫
