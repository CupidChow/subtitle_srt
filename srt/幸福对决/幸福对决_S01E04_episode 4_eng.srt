Oh, thank you.

14
00:01:20,794 --> 00:01:22,244
Ji Yool.

15
00:01:23,104 --> 00:01:24,994
Where is your room?

16
00:02:08,344 --> 00:02:10,094
Yu Jin!

17
00:02:10,094 --> 00:02:12,234
Oh, what should I do? What should I do?

18
00:02:12,234 --> 00:02:15,174
H-Help me... You...

19
00:02:15,174 --> 00:02:16,544
help me...

20
00:02:16,544 --> 00:02:18,834
What? Say it again.

21
00:02:18,834 --> 00:02:21,504
You know... the number...

22
00:02:21,504 --> 00:02:23,664
Y-You know the culprit.

23
00:02:23,664 --> 00:02:25,394
I-I... know them?

24
00:02:25,394 --> 00:02:29,024
Wh-Who is it? Who would do this?

25
00:02:31,114 --> 00:02:32,854
It's you.

26
00:02:38,964 --> 00:02:41,214
You die, too! Die!

27
00:02:41,214 --> 00:02:44,154
You die, too! You die, too! Die!

28
00:02:44,154 --> 00:02:49,304
Die! You die, too! Die!

29
00:02:49,304 --> 00:02:52,594
Auntie!

30
00:02:57,934 --> 00:03:02,064
Real Auntie, get up!

31
00:03:02,064 --> 00:03:03,824
All right. I'll get up.

32
00:03:03,824 --> 00:03:05,604
Stop, stop.

33
00:04:28,674 --> 00:04:31,544
It's a refreshing morning, isn't it?

34
00:04:32,654 --> 00:04:33,954
Thank you.

35
00:04:33,954 --> 00:04:35,424
Oh, okay. Here.

36
00:04:35,424 --> 00:04:37,814
Give me a minute. Let me just get this.

37
00:04:39,894 --> 00:04:43,164
Auntie, I'm done!

38
00:04:43,164 --> 00:04:45,644
Okay, just wash up and come out!

39
00:04:45,644 --> 00:04:48,504
You have to wipe me!

40
00:04:50,384 --> 00:04:52,244
You want me to wipe you?

41
00:04:58,604 --> 00:04:59,894
Ji Yool, let's wear this.

42
00:04:59,894 --> 00:05:02,364
No! I want to wear the teddy one.

43
00:05:02,364 --> 00:05:03,724
Let's wear this just for today!

44
00:05:03,724 --> 00:05:07,684
No! No! I said I don't want to!

45
00:05:26,514 --> 00:05:29,484
- Here, eat.
 - I want braids, too.

46
00:05:29,484 --> 00:05:31,144
I don't know how to do human hair. Hurry up and eat.

47
00:05:31,144 --> 00:05:34,784
Do it for me, too!

48
00:05:45,864 --> 00:05:48,564
I feel bad because I think I'm always getting your help.

49
00:05:48,564 --> 00:05:52,314
No worries. Mornings are always the most hectic.

50
00:05:52,314 --> 00:05:55,514
I've portioned them into individual servings. Just heat them up and eat them.

51
00:05:55,514 --> 00:05:56,994
Let me know if you run out.

52
00:05:56,994 --> 00:06:00,444
Oh, no, that's all right. I won't bother you anymore.

53
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:02,894
I'm disappointed if you think it's a bother.

54
00:06:02,894 --> 00:06:06,174
I was so close to this family.

55
00:06:09,774 --> 00:06:11,684
Do you want a hairpin here?

56
00:06:11,684 --> 00:06:13,154
Yes.

57
00:06:16,904 --> 00:06:21,034
Where would the hairpin be?

58
00:06:38,884 --> 00:06:40,984
 Ms. Song Jeong Ah!

59
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:48,064
I was looking for the girls' hairband.

60
00:06:48,064 --> 00:06:50,914
The layout is the opposite of our unit.

61
00:07:01,744 --> 00:07:04,344
Are the kids better after being frightened?

62
00:07:04,344 --> 00:07:06,474
Oh, yes.

63
00:07:06,474 --> 00:07:08,644
I was really grateful to you that time.

64
00:07:08,644 --> 00:07:10,564
Today, as well.

65
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:13,334
Please don't make me repeat myself.

66
00:07:13,334 --> 00:07:17,444
Yu Jin's sister is a sister to me, too.

67
00:07:18,394 --> 00:07:20,544
By the way,

68
00:07:20,544 --> 00:07:24,354
I've known Yu Jin for more than three years now.

69
00:07:24,354 --> 00:07:27,534
But how come I've never heard about you before?

70
00:07:30,314 --> 00:07:34,124
We haven't kept in touch for a long time.

71
00:07:35,964 --> 00:07:38,884
If it was for a long time,

72
00:07:38,884 --> 00:07:40,674
how long is that?

73
00:07:46,554 --> 00:07:50,174
Not since 11th grade in high school.

74
00:07:50,174 --> 00:07:51,814
So it had been 18 years.

75
00:07:51,814 --> 00:07:54,124
Oh, I see.

76
00:07:55,024 --> 00:07:57,504
You finally reconnected with her, and that happened to her.

77
00:07:57,504 --> 00:08:00,324
You must be so heartbroken.

78
00:08:01,344 --> 00:08:04,304
But are you going to leave that up there?

79
00:08:08,034 --> 00:08:12,124
- Why?
 - It feels weird to see a dead person's face every day.

80
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:14,894
You have to gradually forget and move on.

81
00:08:15,964 --> 00:08:17,784
All done.

82
00:08:19,114 --> 00:08:21,544
What's this?

83
00:08:23,414 --> 00:08:25,634
- Bye-bye! 
- Bye!

84
00:08:25,634 --> 00:08:27,164
- Bye!
 - Good morning!

85
00:08:27,164 --> 00:08:28,804
Good morning!

86
00:08:30,194 --> 00:08:32,404
Good morning!

87
00:08:32,404 --> 00:08:34,384
 Assistant Manager, I'm dying here.

88
00:08:34,384 --> 00:08:36,064
 Can't you please answer my calls?

89
00:08:36,064 --> 00:08:38,954
 From all these final copies, which one is the real final version?

90
00:08:38,954 --> 00:08:43,324
 Isn't delegating the work properly a humane thing to do here?

91
00:08:43,324 --> 00:08:45,944
If you're not busy, do you want to have brunch with us?

92
00:08:45,944 --> 00:08:47,134
I'm all right.

93
00:08:47,134 --> 00:08:49,434
Oh, don't be like that and just join us.

94
00:08:49,434 --> 00:08:51,884
We were all waiting for you.

95
00:08:53,494 --> 00:08:57,794
When Ji Yool and Ha Yool disappeared, the moms here helped out so much.

96
00:08:57,794 --> 00:09:00,924
You haven't even properly met each other since that incident, right?

97
00:09:00,924 --> 00:09:04,074
Y-Yes. Thank you very much.

98
00:09:04,074 --> 00:09:05,474
Don't worry about it.

99
00:09:05,474 --> 00:09:07,474
We all have to help each other.

100
00:09:07,474 --> 00:09:12,144
Instead of standing here, why don't we continue our conversation over brunch?

101
00:09:12,144 --> 00:09:13,714
Let's do that.

102
00:09:16,744 --> 00:09:18,444
Oh, right!

103
00:09:18,444 --> 00:09:20,974
I forgot the most important thing.

104
00:09:20,974 --> 00:09:23,474
We have to make a card key.

105
00:09:24,474 --> 00:09:26,094
I told you already, didn't I?

106
00:09:26,094 --> 00:09:29,334
If you don't have a certified copy, we can't make a resident card.

107
00:09:29,334 --> 00:09:33,364
Director, I'll tell you again as well.

108
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,534
She's here in place of Oh Yu Jin.

109
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:37,234
I understand.

110
00:09:37,234 --> 00:09:39,524
But if we start making exceptions like this...

111
00:09:39,524 --> 00:09:41,904
- I'm all right so—
 - Please stay quiet.

112
00:09:41,904 --> 00:09:45,724
Are you doing this even while knowing what happened in their home?

113
00:09:45,724 --> 00:09:47,234
What about the poor kids?

114
00:09:47,234 --> 00:09:50,594
As their aunt, she even quit her job to come and take care of the kids.

115
00:09:50,594 --> 00:09:54,554
Are you saying our apartment community can't even make that kind of accommodation?

116
00:09:54,554 --> 00:09:57,414
On the surface, you pretend to care about principles and regulations.

117
00:09:57,414 --> 00:10:01,094
But in reality, you avoid doing anything that's inconvenient for you.

118
00:10:01,094 --> 00:10:05,874
Or should I call the president of the Women's Association and have this issue up for a vote?

119
00:10:05,874 --> 00:10:08,884
Does it look like I wouldn't do it?

120
00:10:08,884 --> 00:10:10,204
Look over here.

121
00:10:10,204 --> 00:10:12,684
- Oh, yes. 
- I'll take it now.

122
00:10:12,684 --> 00:10:15,244
One, two, three.

123
00:10:40,994 --> 00:10:42,294
Oh, that's right!

124
00:10:42,294 --> 00:10:45,144
I didn't send you the link to the apartment's mom's cafe, did I?

125
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,614
- I-I'm okay...
- You'll need it to take care of them.

126
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:49,684
 Trinite 99. Chat invite.

127

 Subscription unavailable at this time

130
00:10:58,834 --> 00:11:01,054
It says it's not the subscription period.

131
00:11:01,054 --> 00:11:03,344
How could that be? Oh, my gosh.

132
00:11:03,344 --> 00:11:05,104
I sent the wrong one.

133
00:11:05,104 --> 00:11:06,384
 Exit chatroom

134
00:11:06,384 --> 00:11:08,334
I'll send it to you again.

135
00:11:12,404 --> 00:11:15,064
 High Prestige Apartment

136
00:11:15,704 --> 00:11:17,804
By the way, where did you get those sunglasses?

137
00:11:17,804 --> 00:11:19,754
They're pretty!

138
00:11:19,754 --> 00:11:22,604
My hubby gave them to me as a gift.

139
00:11:22,604 --> 00:11:24,274
They are pretty classy, aren't they.

140
00:11:24,274 --> 00:11:25,954
They're pretty.

141
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:36,584
- What were you all talking about?
 - Eonni, you're here!

142
00:11:36,584 --> 00:11:37,894
Hello.

143
00:11:39,304 --> 00:11:40,994
What are you doing?

144
00:11:43,884 --> 00:11:48,574
Oh, yeah. Eonni, about Min Seong's ice hockey teacher, Mr. Won Ho Min from Canada.

145
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:50,274
Was he a former NHL player?

146
00:11:50,274 --> 00:11:53,124
I think so. Why? Do you want to send Eun Han there, too?

147
00:11:53,124 --> 00:11:54,664
I'm thinking about it.

148
00:11:54,664 --> 00:11:57,344
We're not in the same position as you or Na Yeong.

149
00:11:57,344 --> 00:12:00,154
We can't afford to let our kids do nothing but play.

150
00:12:00,154 --> 00:12:04,864
That's what I mean. Unlike other people, we don't have a company or building to give them.

151
00:12:04,864 --> 00:12:06,154
I told you, that belongs to my dad.

152
00:12:06,154 --> 00:12:08,874
Regardless, it will be handed down to Min Seong and Ah Rin.

153
00:12:08,874 --> 00:12:10,934
It's your own fault for being incompetent.

154
00:12:10,934 --> 00:12:13,944
Oh, my gosh! Eonni! Wow.

155
00:12:14,974 --> 00:12:17,494
What is this Eonni saying?

156
00:12:19,534 --> 00:12:22,604
Mi Ho, you must be left-handed.

157
00:12:22,604 --> 00:12:25,124
Oh, only when I'm eating.

158
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:26,954
It's been a habit since childhood.

159
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,154
Do sisters resemble each other in things like that, too?

160
00:12:29,154 --> 00:12:32,064
I haven't heard of such a thing before.

161
00:12:32,064 --> 00:12:35,424
I guess it happened while eating together and copying each other growing up.

162
00:12:35,424 --> 00:12:38,544
Which one of you followed the other?

163
00:12:38,544 --> 00:12:42,214
Did you think you'd look special because you're left-handed?

164
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:49,244
Why are you embarrassing her?

165
00:12:49,244 --> 00:12:51,654
Besides, what's the use of bringing that up now?

166
00:12:51,654 --> 00:12:53,724
Its about a person who is no longer with us.

167
00:12:54,594 --> 00:12:58,354
Let's stop being sad and just offer our condolences.

168
00:12:58,354 --> 00:13:00,534
We should quickly forget and overcome this.

169
00:13:00,534 --> 00:13:02,904
This is what Yu Jin would want from above, too.

170
00:13:02,904 --> 00:13:04,244
That's right.

171
00:13:04,244 --> 00:13:05,954
My heart breaks so much.

172
00:13:05,954 --> 00:13:07,354
I know.

173
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:10,854
All the apartment community members should be of one mind.

174
00:13:10,854 --> 00:13:15,884
But I hope one bottom feeder won't contaminate the rest of the neighborhood.

175
00:13:22,794 --> 00:13:24,874
Eonni, you know that—

176
00:13:24,874 --> 00:13:28,484
I have a lot to do so I'll leave first.

177
00:13:28,484 --> 00:13:31,884
But still, you should stay a little longer. The food should be coming out soon.

178
00:13:31,884 --> 00:13:35,374
I'm sorry. Don't mind me, and continue your conversation.

179
00:13:38,804 --> 00:13:40,834
Why do you keep humiliating her?

180
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:43,184
When did I do that?

181
00:13:45,804 --> 00:13:47,874
But it seems they really are sisters.

182
00:13:47,874 --> 00:13:50,394
Their bad tempers are so similar.

183
00:13:56,064 --> 00:14:00,694
 But I hope one bottom feeder won't contaminate the rest of the neighborhood.

184
00:14:00,694 --> 00:14:04,994
 Let's stop being sad. We should quickly forget and overcome this.

185
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:15,414
 Why on earth would anyone do this? Why? Tenth day in the dark following the murder case of the Bannae-dong couple

186
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:29,654
I have no time to think...

187
00:14:35,394 --> 00:14:37,144
 Shopping list: Milk

188
00:14:40,584 --> 00:14:43,244
 Milk

189
00:14:46,534 --> 00:14:50,214
 High Prestige

190
00:14:51,574 --> 00:14:53,844
 Advice in parenting.

191
00:14:53,844 --> 00:14:58,224
 Hello. Please give me some advice on how to take care of girls aged 7 and 5.

192
00:14:58,224 --> 00:15:01,214
 Due to personal reasons, I'll be taking care of these children for now,

193
00:15:01,214 --> 00:15:03,784
but I'm facing many challenges due to my inexperience.

194
00:15:03,784 --> 00:15:09,094
 I would appreciate advice, especially regarding their health and studies.

195
00:15:09,094 --> 00:15:12,714
 Hello! Welcome!

196
00:15:12,714 --> 00:15:15,734
 First, their meals are the most important thing.

197
00:15:15,734 --> 00:15:17,564
 They need protein twice a day.

198
00:15:17,564 --> 00:15:20,474
 It's good to give them meat that's not fatty.

199
00:15:20,474 --> 00:15:21,594
 Beef Tenderloin. Korean Beef. ₩92,200 (~$9).

200
00:15:31,834 --> 00:15:33,334
 Every morning, as soon as they get up,

201
00:15:33,334 --> 00:15:36,544
 give them warm water with probiotics on an empty stomach.

202
00:15:36,544 --> 00:15:38,994
 Iron, vitamin D, and vitamin C.

203
00:15:38,994 --> 00:15:42,174
 And propolis before they go to bed.

204
00:15:44,324 --> 00:15:47,804
 Try to maintain the humidity between 50 and 60 percent if possible.

205
00:15:47,804 --> 00:15:49,374
 Check the air pollution level,

206
00:15:49,374 --> 00:15:53,064
 and on the days it's bad, it's better not to go outside.

207
00:15:53,064 --> 00:15:56,474
 It's good to get them into a habit of taking morning walks.

208
00:15:56,474 --> 00:16:01,044
 Three English quizzes and three sheets of arithmetic is a sufficient amount.

209
00:16:31,084 --> 00:16:33,664
Why isn't this coming off easily?

210
00:16:44,244 --> 00:16:46,544
 Mom

211
00:16:49,724 --> 00:16:51,354
Hi, Mom.

212
00:16:53,274 --> 00:16:55,114
Oh, that was great!

213
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,134
Who's going to get the bill today?

214
00:16:57,134 --> 00:17:00,934
Since your husband got that for you, I guess you'll be paying. Right, Jeong Ah?

215
00:17:00,934 --> 00:17:05,734
Don't even think about ganging up on me, and just take out your resident card.

216
00:17:13,244 --> 00:17:14,904
What are you doing?

217
00:17:19,764 --> 00:17:22,084
What should we choose today?

218
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:23,784
Husband?

219
00:17:23,784 --> 00:17:26,334
How about a designer bag?

220
00:17:29,384 --> 00:17:36,434
 Honey, I'm at the department store now. Can I buy a designer bag?

221
00:17:36,434 --> 00:17:37,304
 My One and Only Love

222
00:17:38,704 --> 00:17:40,824
 What's gotten into you?

223
00:17:41,834 --> 00:17:46,274
 My Breath, My Soul...♥

224
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:48,364
 Yes, buy.

225
00:17:49,574 --> 00:17:51,554
 But with your card.

226
00:17:53,274 --> 00:17:55,634
 My Minion Su Bin ♥

227
00:17:56,414 --> 00:17:58,404
I'm exempted from this.

228
00:17:58,404 --> 00:18:02,124
 Why are you even asking me? Of course, it's okay.

229
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:05,894
He's trembling in fear, trying to watch his wife's mood.

230
00:18:05,894 --> 00:18:09,814
I'm so envious that you have a husband who's nine years younger than you.

231
00:18:09,814 --> 00:18:11,664
Eonni, doesn't it make you nervous?

232
00:18:11,664 --> 00:18:15,984
I don't know about that. I guess the nervous one would be my husband, not me.

233
00:18:15,984 --> 00:18:18,824
He understands our family power structure very well.

234
00:18:18,824 --> 00:18:20,814
Su Bin can never leave me.

235
00:18:20,814 --> 00:18:22,404
I'm confident of that.

236
00:18:22,404 --> 00:18:25,554
- Oh, look at you!
 - So cool.

237
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:30,134
But you're not confident about his love, though?

238
00:18:32,714 --> 00:18:34,384
Why wouldn't I be?

239
00:18:34,384 --> 00:18:38,734
Anyway, it looks like we'll have to send the lunch bill to your unit.

240
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:44,874
Na Yeong, thanks for lunch.

241
00:18:50,804 --> 00:18:52,254
 The man who can't live without me ♥

242
00:18:53,184 --> 00:18:55,294
What did he say?

243
00:18:57,064 --> 00:18:58,824
 Let the Sales Associate in charge know.

244
00:18:58,824 --> 00:19:00,974
 I'll pick it up on my way home.

245
00:19:02,144 --> 00:19:04,244
I guess actions speak louder than words, right?

246
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:05,494
Of course!

247
00:19:05,494 --> 00:19:08,774
We spend money on what we love, don't we?

248
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:11,124
Lunch is on me today.

249
00:19:27,924 --> 00:19:31,454
You put me away in here and hardly ever visit these days.

250
00:19:31,454 --> 00:19:33,694
When did you decide to take half a day off?

251
00:19:33,694 --> 00:19:36,624
You missed work for three days because of the funeral. Is that okay?

252
00:19:36,624 --> 00:19:39,644
This won't affect your promotion?

253
00:19:39,644 --> 00:19:41,204
It's all right.

254
00:19:41,204 --> 00:19:43,754
I should've gone.

255
00:19:43,754 --> 00:19:47,144
There was a time we lived as mother and daughter in the same house.

256
00:19:48,144 --> 00:19:52,634
If you think about it, she had such a horrible fate.

257
00:19:52,634 --> 00:19:54,334
When we used to live in Seora-dong,

258
00:19:54,334 --> 00:19:58,474
the realtor, Mr. Yang, said her face was full of ominous energy,

259
00:19:58,474 --> 00:20:00,884
and she had a petulant look in her eyes.

260
00:20:00,884 --> 00:20:03,974
I wondered why he was saying that about a young girl.

261
00:20:03,974 --> 00:20:06,404
How can you say something like that?

262
00:20:06,404 --> 00:20:07,984
But isn't that the case?

263
00:20:07,984 --> 00:20:10,514
It's not common to die like that.

264
00:20:10,514 --> 00:20:12,704
They haven't caught the culprit yet, right?

265
00:20:14,624 --> 00:20:18,184
No matter how I think about it, I bet it was a crime of passion.

266
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:22,004
There's a reason why they say the daughter follows her mother's fate.

267
00:20:22,004 --> 00:20:23,724
- Mom!
 - What?

268
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:25,614
Did I say something wrong?

269
00:20:25,614 --> 00:20:28,564
You often do this and make me look ridiculous.

270
00:20:28,564 --> 00:20:31,144
If you react that way, what does that make me?

271
00:20:32,734 --> 00:20:36,014
Sorry. I wasn't saying anything about you.

272
00:20:36,014 --> 00:20:39,064
In any case, you should quickly forget her, too.

273
00:20:39,064 --> 00:20:41,734
No need to linger on such a horrible event.

274
00:20:41,734 --> 00:20:44,804
I'm saying that because I know you very well.

275
00:20:45,804 --> 00:20:47,774
I think I need to get going.

276
00:20:48,774 --> 00:20:53,764
All right. You're very busy. I don't want to take too much of your time.

277
00:20:53,764 --> 00:20:54,954
Go and work.

278
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:58,294
You have to pay off the loan on the Gapyeong house, too.

279
00:21:10,204 --> 00:21:13,914
 It feels weird to see a dead person's face every day.

280
00:21:13,914 --> 00:21:16,084
 You have to gradually forget and move on.

281
00:21:16,084 --> 00:21:19,134
 In any case, you should quickly forget her, too.

282
00:21:19,134 --> 00:21:22,254
 No need to linger on such a horrible event.

283
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,384
 I felt it was unfair that only you were living happily.

284
00:21:26,384 --> 00:21:31,414
 So, if you don't want everything you did in the past exposed, shut your mouth.

285
00:21:45,474 --> 00:21:46,644
Hello!

286
00:21:46,644 --> 00:21:49,024
I'm sorry. I'm a little late, aren't I?

287
00:21:52,724 --> 00:21:53,974
Did something happen?

288
00:21:53,974 --> 00:21:58,184
They had a little fight, but they won't say what it's about.

289
00:21:58,184 --> 00:22:01,124
But they quickly apologized and forgave each other.

290
00:22:01,124 --> 00:22:03,614
They should be all right.

291
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:04,994
Right?

292
00:22:08,404 --> 00:22:10,024
Is it good?

293
00:22:11,954 --> 00:22:14,054
Why did you two fight?

294
00:22:15,624 --> 00:22:17,814
You have to be nice to each other.

295
00:22:17,814 --> 00:22:19,304
Okay.

296
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:26,544
Shall we go to the playground after you finish eating?

297
00:22:26,544 --> 00:22:29,314
- I don't want to go! 
- I want to go!

298
00:22:30,584 --> 00:22:32,664
Why are you guys like this all of a sudden?

299
00:22:32,664 --> 00:22:34,444
I want to go! Go!

300
00:22:34,444 --> 00:22:36,114
I said I don't want to go to the playground!

301
00:22:36,114 --> 00:22:38,894
- Ji Yool, you can't throw that on the ground—
 - I hate you, Eonni!

302
00:22:38,894 --> 00:22:41,694
I want to go to the playground!

303
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:44,914
We can plant Mom's tree again, can't we?

304
00:22:44,914 --> 00:22:47,114
I told you not to talk about bad things!

305
00:22:47,114 --> 00:22:50,174
I told you not to talk about Mom!

306
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:54,424
What are you talking about?

307
00:22:54,424 --> 00:22:56,464
Who told you that?

308
00:22:58,124 --> 00:23:00,494
I'm asking you. Who said things like that?

309
00:23:03,024 --> 00:23:05,044
All the adults.

310
00:23:05,044 --> 00:23:08,624
They hate it.

311
00:23:09,724 --> 00:23:14,474
They hate it when we talk about Mom.

312
00:23:16,074 --> 00:23:20,204
Grandpa, teachers,

313
00:23:20,204 --> 00:23:22,614
and even our aunties, too.

314
00:23:22,614 --> 00:23:25,084
Even you, our real aunt.

315
00:23:25,084 --> 00:23:29,874
It's because stuff about Mom is bad.

316
00:23:33,764 --> 00:23:35,854
No, that's not true. I don't hate it.

317
00:23:35,854 --> 00:23:38,404
It's not bad to talk about her.

318
00:23:40,314 --> 00:23:43,694
It's because the adults are sad.

319
00:23:43,694 --> 00:23:46,674
We feel sad when we talk about your mom. That's why.

320
00:23:46,674 --> 00:23:49,569
If you want to talk about your mom, you can.

321
00:23:49,569 --> 00:23:52,859
Whenever you guys want to talk about her, you can.

322
00:23:55,304 --> 00:23:58,294
Mom!

323
00:24:25,624 --> 00:24:28,204
Hello, Eonni.

324
00:24:28,204 --> 00:24:30,494
Ji Yool and Ha Yool, what are you doing?

325
00:24:32,564 --> 00:24:35,134
Are you trying to plant the tree again?

326
00:24:35,134 --> 00:24:37,214
- Yes.
 - Oh, I see.

327
00:24:37,214 --> 00:24:39,274
It would be nice to plant it together.

328
00:24:39,274 --> 00:24:42,584
But we just stopped by to look for the kickboard.

329
00:24:42,584 --> 00:24:45,434
Oh, right. We're going to the kids' cafe together tomorrow.

330
00:24:45,434 --> 00:24:48,244
Ji Yool and Ha Yool are going too, right?

331
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:51,574
Yes, I guess so. We'll go.

332
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:54,574
All right. We'll see you tomorrow.

333
00:24:55,454 --> 00:24:58,254
Why don't you plant another tree instead?

334
00:24:58,254 --> 00:25:02,464
We don't know their intentions behind ruining that tree.

335
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,154
Then we have to fix it.

336
00:25:04,154 --> 00:25:07,754
Whatever their intentions were, we can find out.

337
00:25:07,754 --> 00:25:10,004
Can I do that, too?

338
00:25:10,004 --> 00:25:12,244
We have to go.

339
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:13,974
Then, I'll see you tomorrow.

340
00:25:13,974 --> 00:25:16,774
- Goodbye.
 - Bye!

341
00:25:45,554 --> 00:25:47,364
Auntie, are you okay?

342
00:25:47,364 --> 00:25:49,614
Yeah, I'm okay.

343
00:25:51,654 --> 00:25:53,134
 A tree of remembrance

344
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,094
Mom would like this.

345
00:25:55,094 --> 00:25:57,274
Will flowers bloom later?

346
00:25:57,274 --> 00:26:00,904
I don't know about that, actually. Let's come by often and take a look.

347
00:26:00,904 --> 00:26:02,814
I'll go get some water. Don't go anywhere.

348
00:26:02,814 --> 00:26:04,494
- Yes.
 - Okay.

349
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:20,574
How is this neighborhood?

350
00:26:20,574 --> 00:26:22,194
It's not easy, is it?

351
00:26:22,194 --> 00:26:23,404
Excuse me?

352
00:26:24,434 --> 00:26:30,704
Oh, dear, I think it will continue to be difficult for you.

353
00:26:30,704 --> 00:26:33,274
What did I do that you're this way with me?

354
00:26:35,924 --> 00:26:42,204
Do you think you will become a better person by replanting the tree or something?

355
00:26:42,204 --> 00:26:46,614
Or you do think you have to do something here?

356
00:26:46,614 --> 00:26:49,234
What are you talking about?

357
00:26:51,154 --> 00:26:54,204
I'm telling you not to do anything to stand out.

358
00:26:54,204 --> 00:26:56,004
Don't even try to do anything.

359
00:26:56,004 --> 00:26:58,734
Just stay still. Very still.

360
00:26:58,734 --> 00:27:01,554
And then just get lost.

361
00:27:01,554 --> 00:27:05,184
I don't understand a thing you're saying right now.

362
00:27:05,184 --> 00:27:07,254
If anything, you're making me more curious about some things.

363
00:27:07,254 --> 00:27:09,434
What exactly you're telling me not to do?

364
00:27:09,434 --> 00:27:11,894
Why do I bother you so much?

365
00:27:15,664 --> 00:27:17,704
Are you really deaf or something?

366
00:27:17,704 --> 00:27:22,224
By the way, when you told me not to poke around, were you referring to Yu Jin?

367
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:24,774
How dare you say something like that!

368
00:27:29,154 --> 00:27:32,194
Your reactions are unexpectedly honest.

369
00:27:34,424 --> 00:27:37,144
I'm sorry, but I'm going to do what I want.

370
00:27:37,144 --> 00:27:40,364
I have no intention of listening to you.

371
00:27:56,134 --> 00:27:57,984
Look!

372
00:27:57,984 --> 00:28:00,524
So Won Eonni!

373
00:28:04,404 --> 00:28:05,754
It's nice to see you around.

374
00:28:05,754 --> 00:28:06,994
Getting off work now?

375
00:28:06,994 --> 00:28:10,264
Yes. I picked up So Won from the academy on my way home.

376
00:28:10,264 --> 00:28:15,234
If you haven't had dinner yet, would you like to eat together with the kids?

377
00:28:18,234 --> 00:28:20,514
Hurry up and jump!

378
00:28:30,824 --> 00:28:33,034
I didn't mean we should eat at your place.

379
00:28:33,034 --> 00:28:35,714
It's okay. It's quick if I do it.

380
00:28:36,664 --> 00:28:38,894
Ever since my husband went to India to work,

381
00:28:38,894 --> 00:28:40,914
it's been lonely eating just by ourselves.

382
00:28:40,914 --> 00:28:43,754
This is nice to eat together.

383
00:28:43,754 --> 00:28:46,744
Actually, I have something to ask you.

384
00:28:46,744 --> 00:28:48,944
It's not easy taking care of two kids, right?

385
00:28:48,944 --> 00:28:50,764
It's not that.

386
00:28:50,764 --> 00:28:56,014
You told me last time that other moms also have grudges against Yu Jin.

387
00:28:56,014 --> 00:28:58,904
Who were you referring to, exactly?

388
00:29:01,864 --> 00:29:04,814
 Zolpidem

389
00:29:18,654 --> 00:29:21,434
 miho_jang726: 0 posts, 0 followers, 1 following

390
00:29:27,594 --> 00:29:29,224
There, eat.

391
00:29:29,224 --> 00:29:31,504

Na Yeong, did your husband buy the bag?

392
00:29:31,504 --> 00:29:33,584
 Why are you so quiet on SNS?

393
00:29:33,584 --> 00:29:36,264
 Did your hubby make an empty promise?

394
00:29:42,234 --> 00:29:46,904
 Just waiting for him to bring the new pretty baby that will fulfill my heart.

395
00:29:46,904 --> 00:29:50,704
 I just said it in passing, but he said he would buy it for me on his way home.

396
00:29:50,704 --> 00:29:53,574
 How did I get to marry such a great guy?

397
00:29:55,064 --> 00:29:57,204
 Ah Rin's mom, I'm so envious!

398
00:29:57,204 --> 00:30:00,744
 So, will tonight be a night of passion?

399
00:30:01,564 --> 00:30:03,134
[ Jeong Ah Eonni

400
00:30:12,754 --> 00:30:15,634
You mean, they're all lies?

401
00:30:16,634 --> 00:30:20,454
Rather than saying they're lies,

402
00:30:20,454 --> 00:30:23,374
we can't believe everything on social media.

403
00:30:23,374 --> 00:30:27,054
Who knows whether they really made up after the performance?

404
00:30:27,054 --> 00:30:31,054
On social media, they acted like best friends.

405
00:30:31,054 --> 00:30:34,144
But who knows how they really felt about each other.

406
00:30:34,144 --> 00:30:37,144
In any case, she's a very jealous woman,

407
00:30:37,144 --> 00:30:39,994
who loves gossiping.

408
00:30:40,954 --> 00:30:43,594
In some ways, she and Yu Jin were like water and fire.

409
00:30:43,594 --> 00:30:48,514
Since they always hung out together, they probably harbored a lot of resentment.

410
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:53,474
Do you think their harbored feelings were closer to grudges?

411
00:30:53,474 --> 00:30:55,484
Who knows.

412
00:30:55,484 --> 00:30:57,590
Don't grudges usually grow stronger

413
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:02,590
between people who are physically closer?

414
00:31:12,034 --> 00:31:13,934
Hey, girls!

415
00:31:13,934 --> 00:31:15,814
Slow down!

416
00:31:18,044 --> 00:31:19,874
You don't have to walk us home.

417
00:31:19,874 --> 00:31:24,384
It's all right. We need to digest our dinner by walking, too.

418
00:31:26,294 --> 00:31:28,354
Oh, this is pretty.

419
00:31:28,354 --> 00:31:31,314
So Won resembles me quite a bit, doesn't she?

420
00:31:31,314 --> 00:31:32,614
Excuse me?

421
00:31:33,894 --> 00:31:35,194
Isn't this cute?

422
00:31:35,194 --> 00:31:36,484
Yes.

423
00:31:43,394 --> 00:31:45,264
Auntie, aren't you getting off?

424
00:31:45,264 --> 00:31:46,894
Get back in here.

425
00:31:50,064 --> 00:31:51,434
Don't even get me started.

426
00:31:51,434 --> 00:31:53,964
She threw a ruckus, telling me to change them out.

427
00:31:53,964 --> 00:31:57,484
Saying crime prevention isn't possible when we can't even see the people's faces!

428
00:31:57,484 --> 00:31:59,384
She caused a huge scene.

429
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:00,624
Are you sure it was her?

430
00:32:00,624 --> 00:32:04,304
Yes, of course. She's famous.

431
00:32:08,284 --> 00:32:10,234
Welcome.

432
00:32:17,984 --> 00:32:20,364
What's up with meeting for a beer all of a sudden?

433
00:32:20,364 --> 00:32:23,124
- Was it you? 
 - What are you talking about?

434
00:32:23,124 --> 00:32:27,674
Before things get complicated, tell me clearly if it was you.

435
00:32:27,674 --> 00:32:29,884
How am I supposed to know what you're talking about?

436
00:32:29,884 --> 00:32:32,824
Are you the one who pulled out the tree?

437
00:32:32,824 --> 00:32:36,224
No, it wasn't. Who said it was me?

438
00:32:38,614 --> 00:32:40,864
Why would I do something like that?

439
00:32:40,864 --> 00:32:44,794
As you said, she's no longer with us.

440
00:32:46,684 --> 00:32:48,274
Are you sure?

441
00:32:48,274 --> 00:32:50,694
Is there something else I should know about?

442
00:32:50,694 --> 00:32:52,894
I said it wasn't me!

443
00:32:55,304 --> 00:32:57,144
Then, that's fine.

444
00:32:59,824 --> 00:33:01,344
Why?

445
00:33:02,404 --> 00:33:06,584
What did that aunt person tell you?

446
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:08,624
You saw her today, right?

447
00:33:08,624 --> 00:33:11,794
She said she'll find out who pulled it out.

448
00:33:11,794 --> 00:33:14,134
I knew this would happen.

449
00:33:14,134 --> 00:33:17,384
I knew she would go poking around everywhere.

450
00:33:18,214 --> 00:33:19,934
I told you, didn't I?

451
00:33:19,934 --> 00:33:23,264
We shouldn't have let her set foot here from the start!

452
00:33:23,264 --> 00:33:25,184
You don't know what you're talking about.

453
00:33:25,184 --> 00:33:29,394
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.

454
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:34,704
But... why are you so on edge?

455
00:33:34,704 --> 00:33:39,214
If you didn't do it, why should it matter whether she pokes around or not?

456
00:33:39,214 --> 00:33:43,854
Why? Do you feel guilty about something now that you're thinking about it?

457
00:33:43,854 --> 00:33:47,794
What about you, Eonni? Why are you so concerned with her?

458
00:33:47,794 --> 00:33:51,304
Even going as far as calling her an enemy.

459
00:33:54,164 --> 00:33:57,614
You wouldn't understand even if I told you. So, you don't need to know.

460
00:33:59,374 --> 00:34:01,834
Just have a glass of beer.

461
00:34:04,044 --> 00:34:06,244
What happened to your finger?

462
00:34:09,194 --> 00:34:12,074
Looks like a wound from a wire cut.

463
00:34:39,064 --> 00:34:41,394
 Department Head, Gong Chang Hyeon

464
00:34:43,454 --> 00:34:45,724
Let me request one more thing.

465
00:34:50,044 --> 00:34:52,334
Ms. Jo.

466
00:34:52,334 --> 00:34:55,584
- Getting off work now?
 - Oh, no, I'm not.

467
00:34:55,584 --> 00:34:58,404
I'm meeting someone around here.

468
00:34:59,824 --> 00:35:02,034
Your boyfriend?

469
00:35:02,034 --> 00:35:04,234
Just a friend.

470
00:35:04,234 --> 00:35:06,784
I see. Have a good time.

471
00:35:06,784 --> 00:35:08,224
Thank you.

472
00:35:12,534 --> 00:35:13,734
Noona!

473
00:35:15,724 --> 00:35:17,924
What are you doing here?

474
00:35:18,684 --> 00:35:20,814
I had a drink with Su Bin.

475
00:35:20,814 --> 00:35:23,184
But he was too drunk, so I walked him home.

476
00:35:23,184 --> 00:35:24,994
He didn't say anything to me.

477
00:35:24,994 --> 00:35:28,204
Just because you're married, you don't tell each other everything.

478
00:35:28,204 --> 00:35:29,634
We do.

479
00:35:29,634 --> 00:35:31,974
Maybe he just forgot, then.

480
00:35:31,974 --> 00:35:35,344
I have to meet someone, so I'll get going.

481
00:35:35,344 --> 00:35:37,724
Give Su Bin some honey tea.

482
00:35:50,824 --> 00:35:52,124
You're home?

483
00:35:52,124 --> 00:35:54,314
The housekeeper said you'd be late.

484
00:35:55,694 --> 00:35:57,304
You must've just gotten home, too.

485
00:35:57,304 --> 00:35:59,324
Yeah, a little bit ago.

486
00:36:13,734 --> 00:36:16,454
Gosh, I didn't drink much.

487
00:36:19,774 --> 00:36:21,684
Su Bin.

488
00:36:21,684 --> 00:36:23,104
Yeah?

489
00:36:23,104 --> 00:36:28,064
If things are difficult at work, tell me.

490
00:36:30,384 --> 00:36:34,334
What's there to be difficult when you're supporting me in everything?

491
00:36:34,334 --> 00:36:39,424
Your brothers are also helping out a lot with the investment liens this time.

492
00:37:36,134 --> 00:37:38,394
 The man who can't live without me ♥

493
00:38:23,944 --> 00:38:25,904
Where have you been?

494
00:38:25,904 --> 00:38:27,704
I knew this would happen.

495
00:38:27,704 --> 00:38:30,634
I knew this would happen!

496
00:38:30,634 --> 00:38:33,444
Why are you at it again? Are you crazy?

497
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:35,024
I'm going to kill you!

498
00:38:35,024 --> 00:38:37,534
I won't let you get away with it this time.

499
00:38:47,014 --> 00:38:48,154
Come on...

500
00:38:48,154 --> 00:38:50,094
 Who were you with?

501
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:52,134
 What's with you? Are you crazy?

502
00:38:52,134 --> 00:38:55,354
How close were you with her that your clothes still reek of her perfume?

503
00:38:55,354 --> 00:38:57,854
Come on, stop it! Please!

504
00:39:35,044 --> 00:39:36,654
Aren't you going to open it?

505
00:39:46,424 --> 00:39:48,354
They said to wait a few days for the bag.

506
00:39:48,354 --> 00:39:50,594
So I bought this instead.

507
00:39:50,594 --> 00:39:54,104
The salesperson's perfume was overpowering.

508
00:39:54,104 --> 00:39:56,364
That's probably when the smell got on my shirt.

509
00:39:56,364 --> 00:39:58,084
I'm sorry.

510
00:39:58,084 --> 00:40:00,554
I forgot to spray the deodorizer.

511
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:04,694
Don't cry.

512
00:40:14,934 --> 00:40:16,574
 Just waiting for him to bring the new pretty baby that will fulfill my heart.

513
00:40:20,814 --> 00:40:22,824
 Associate Manager Lee Jin Seob (Digital Division)

514
00:40:26,374 --> 00:40:29,054
What? You really came?

515
00:40:38,964 --> 00:40:42,144
How desperate do you think I was to come all the way here?

516
00:40:42,144 --> 00:40:43,684
Don't even get me started.

517
00:40:43,684 --> 00:40:47,944
The Team Leader is working me into the ground.

518
00:40:49,534 --> 00:40:51,294
So, are you really staying here?

519
00:40:51,294 --> 00:40:53,554
Why? So you can spread rumors again?

520
00:40:53,554 --> 00:40:54,904
Come on, Assistant Manager.

521
00:40:54,904 --> 00:40:56,724
Mind your own business and go.

522
00:40:56,724 --> 00:40:58,874
Just go!

523
00:40:58,874 --> 00:41:00,644
- Gosh, really.
 - Just go.

524
00:41:00,644 --> 00:41:03,784
I was just worried about you. Can't I worry about you?

525
00:41:03,784 --> 00:41:07,374
You're living in a house where that terrible incident happened.

526
00:41:07,374 --> 00:41:09,704
So, are you really alright?

527
00:41:09,704 --> 00:41:13,034
I mean, I know this is a really nice place.

528
00:41:13,034 --> 00:41:16,804
But why must you stay here?

529
00:41:16,804 --> 00:41:19,014
- Oh, and by the way.
 - What, now?

530
00:41:19,014 --> 00:41:23,424
I just wanted to say I'm truly sorry about that time.

531
00:41:23,424 --> 00:41:27,134
You told me you weren't disappointed by me, but

532
00:41:27,134 --> 00:41:29,084
I wanted to apologize.

533
00:41:29,984 --> 00:41:32,974
I want to be on good terms with you.

534
00:41:32,974 --> 00:41:35,774
That won't ever happen again.

535
00:41:35,774 --> 00:41:39,644
So, please let your guard down from time to time.

536
00:41:42,684 --> 00:41:46,274
Then, I-I'll get going now.

537
00:42:00,924 --> 00:42:03,194
Let my guard down, huh.

538
00:42:05,044 --> 00:42:07,784
 The Team Leader asked me to check with you if there were any

539
00:42:07,784 --> 00:42:11,254
 additional edits from the last meeting's minutes.

540
00:42:11,254 --> 00:42:14,584
 Any other changes besides sending an official request to the Development Department?

541
00:42:14,584 --> 00:42:18,384
This is why I can't give them an inch.

542
00:42:23,894 --> 00:42:25,744
 Ji Yool's aunt, are you on your way?

543
00:42:25,744 --> 00:42:28,724
 You didn't forget about going to the kids' cafe after, right?

544
00:42:28,724 --> 00:42:30,234
I'm late again!

545
00:42:30,234 --> 00:42:32,524
I'm late again!

546
00:42:36,374 --> 00:42:38,294
- Real Auntie! 
- Real Auntie!

547
00:42:38,294 --> 00:42:40,244
- Oh, really?
 - Yes.

548
00:42:40,244 --> 00:42:42,164
Real Auntie!

549
00:42:42,164 --> 00:42:44,444
I'm sorry.

550
00:42:44,444 --> 00:42:47,414
I don't think I can join you for dinner tonight.

551
00:42:47,414 --> 00:42:49,574
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

552
00:42:49,574 --> 00:42:51,294
There is nothing that can be done about it then.

553
00:42:51,294 --> 00:42:54,144
It doesn't look good to have an empty seat.

554
00:42:54,144 --> 00:42:55,594
I'm really sorry.

555
00:42:55,594 --> 00:42:57,664
Ms. Jo!

556
00:42:57,664 --> 00:42:59,894
I think I have to go inside.

557
00:42:59,894 --> 00:43:02,164
Have fun, and see you tomorrow!

558
00:43:02,164 --> 00:43:05,124
Oh, you have a new bracelet.

559
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:08,594
Oh, yes. I received it as a gift.

560
00:43:08,594 --> 00:43:10,844
From who? Your boyfriend?

561
00:43:10,844 --> 00:43:13,104
So you did see him last night.

562
00:43:14,104 --> 00:43:17,584
Gosh, look at me asking inappropriate questions.

563
00:43:17,584 --> 00:43:21,414
Anyway, it looks even prettier on a younger lady.

564
00:43:22,344 --> 00:43:23,374
Min Seong, let's go.

565
00:43:23,374 --> 00:43:25,384
- Let's go.
 - Hold my hand.

566
00:43:30,984 --> 00:43:32,994
What are you doing?

567
00:43:41,124 --> 00:43:42,534
Let's go.

568
00:43:45,344 --> 00:43:46,934
Did you have a good day?

569
00:43:50,014 --> 00:43:52,644
By chance, are you free this evening?

570
00:43:52,644 --> 00:43:56,044
Excuse me? Why are you asking?

571
00:43:56,044 --> 00:43:58,924
There's a monthly parents' meeting.

572
00:43:58,924 --> 00:44:01,514
We have dinner together following a short meeting.

573
00:44:01,514 --> 00:44:03,504
You should join us.

574
00:44:03,504 --> 00:44:05,344
Oh, I see.

575
00:44:05,344 --> 00:44:08,694
It's pretty casual, so you can come comfortably.

576
00:44:08,694 --> 00:44:10,554
Do you feel pressured?

577
00:44:10,554 --> 00:44:15,114
No. I just feel like you're being too good to me.

578
00:44:15,114 --> 00:44:17,674
You can just take it as a favor.

579
00:44:17,674 --> 00:44:20,544
On the second floor of the center at 7:30 pm this evening.

580
00:44:20,544 --> 00:44:24,214
At 7:30 pm in the evening?

581
00:44:24,214 --> 00:44:26,974
You don't have anyone to watch the kids, right?

582
00:44:26,974 --> 00:44:30,014
Eonni, I need to go somewhere really quickly.

583
00:44:30,014 --> 00:44:31,934
You didn't pick up the brochures for tonight, right?

584
00:44:31,934 --> 00:44:34,914
- They'll bring it to us this afternoon...
 - I'll pick it up.

585
00:44:34,914 --> 00:44:37,424
Please watch Ah Rin for me.

586
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:39,304
Me, too. I'll go with you!

587
00:44:39,304 --> 00:44:41,594
I think it will be difficult on your own.

588
00:44:58,284 --> 00:44:59,774
What are you doing right now? Get out.

589
00:44:59,774 --> 00:45:02,764
Let's go together. I have things to ask you, too.

590
00:45:06,534 --> 00:45:09,674
I'm not trying to argue with you. I just have a few things I'd like to—

591
00:45:09,674 --> 00:45:12,668
Why are you so curious? About what!

592
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:15,804
I told you not to go poking around. I told you not to butt in!

593
00:45:15,804 --> 00:45:19,174
Are you that curious why that woman died?

594
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:23,224
Th-That's not what I was going to ask you.

595
00:45:23,224 --> 00:45:25,484
Murder.

596
00:45:25,484 --> 00:45:26,774
What a joke.

597
00:45:26,774 --> 00:45:28,054
That woman.

598
00:45:28,054 --> 00:45:32,304
That woman killed herself! She killed herself!

599
00:45:32,304 --> 00:45:34,854
She went on a rampage and ended up killing herself.

600
00:45:34,854 --> 00:45:36,874
I don't know why you are reacting this way.

601
00:45:36,874 --> 00:45:40,714
Since you seem upset, we can talk another time.

602
00:45:47,524 --> 00:45:50,924
Seriously! She cut her own life short.

603
00:45:50,924 --> 00:45:53,734
Why do you keep doing this to me? What the hell did I do?

604
00:45:53,734 --> 00:45:57,144
I got it. Na Yeong, please slow down!

605
00:46:11,994 --> 00:46:13,584
Yes.

606
00:46:16,074 --> 00:46:18,924
 They said to wait a few days for the bag.   So I bought this instead.

607
00:46:18,954 --> 00:46:21,724
 The salesperson's perfume was overpowering.

608
00:46:22,394 --> 00:46:24,164
 That's probably when the smell got on my shirt.

609
00:46:24,164 --> 00:46:26,044
Filthy.

610
00:46:26,044 --> 00:46:28,174
You deserve to die.

611
00:46:30,874 --> 00:46:33,194
What are you doing?

612
00:47:17,274 --> 00:47:19,394
I'm all right.

613
00:47:19,394 --> 00:47:21,184
How are the kids?

614
00:47:49,344 --> 00:47:52,494
I don't know how I should apologize for this.

615
00:47:53,764 --> 00:47:57,784
I'm all right. But I think the teacher is in shock.

616
00:47:57,784 --> 00:48:00,544
I won't make excuses saying she wasn't a good driver.

617
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,794
I'm sure you saw everything.

618
00:48:07,294 --> 00:48:10,644
Another mom from the same class. A salesperson.

619
00:48:10,644 --> 00:48:12,834
Today, it was the teacher.

620
00:48:14,104 --> 00:48:16,034
She has a kind of anger management disorder.

621
00:48:16,034 --> 00:48:18,174
She snaps in a moment.

622
00:48:18,174 --> 00:48:21,904
She has difficulty controlling sudden emotions.

623
00:48:21,904 --> 00:48:26,794
Sometimes, she doesn't even seem to recall what she did.

624
00:48:58,044 --> 00:48:59,944
Why do you keep looking at the clock?

625
00:48:59,944 --> 00:49:01,644
I told you to keep your head like this!

626
00:49:01,644 --> 00:49:03,184
Okay, okay, okay.

627
00:49:03,184 --> 00:49:05,794
- Auntie said she was going somewhere today. 
- Where?

628
00:49:05,794 --> 00:49:08,884
I was going to go, but I decided not to.

629
00:49:08,884 --> 00:49:11,524
- Why?
 - Since I can't go with you girls.

630
00:49:11,524 --> 00:49:13,594
Why can't we go?

631
00:49:18,264 --> 00:49:20,414
Wait a second. Wait.

632
00:49:23,984 --> 00:49:26,684
 I have body aches from the car accident,

633
00:49:26,684 --> 00:49:28,854
 but I can't miss our meeting!

634
00:49:28,854 --> 00:49:31,374
 My hubby looks good, and he's fixated on food.

635
00:49:31,374 --> 00:49:33,374
This crazy—

636
00:49:39,714 --> 00:49:42,294
Actually, I do think I have to go. I'll be right back.

637
00:49:42,294 --> 00:49:44,664
Then, what about us?

638
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:49,944
What about the handover?

639
00:49:49,944 --> 00:49:51,264
You said you've watched your nieces and nephews, right? Just for two hours, okay?

640
00:49:51,264 --> 00:49:52,994
I'm entrusting them to you this one time!

641
00:49:52,994 --> 00:49:55,554
- What?
 - I'll explain it when I get back.

642
00:49:55,554 --> 00:49:57,804
Wait, Assistant Manager...

643
00:50:09,524 --> 00:50:11,524
Who are you?

644
00:50:11,524 --> 00:50:12,774
Me?

645
00:50:13,774 --> 00:50:16,074
- Uncle.
 - Real Uncle?

646
00:50:16,074 --> 00:50:17,824
Real?

647
00:50:17,824 --> 00:50:19,624
Are there fake ones?

648
00:50:19,624 --> 00:50:22,034
Yes, Real Uncle.

649
00:50:31,084 --> 00:50:33,634
Across the street this time around...

650
00:50:33,634 --> 00:50:37,604
So Min, I saw on social media that you went camping last weekend.

651
00:50:37,604 --> 00:50:38,714
Wasn't it hard?

652
00:50:38,714 --> 00:50:41,914
I know. It's so much work if you go out on the weekends

653
00:50:41,914 --> 00:50:44,154
between work and taking care of the kids.

654
00:50:44,154 --> 00:50:46,354
That's why I don't like going anywhere unless we stay at a hotel.

655
00:50:46,354 --> 00:50:50,544
Oh, my! Seong Hui, you must do all the work when you guys go out.

656
00:50:50,544 --> 00:50:52,304
My hubby does everything in my family.

657
00:50:52,304 --> 00:50:54,474
He won't even let me lift a finger.

658
00:50:54,474 --> 00:50:59,214
Despite everything, he cares so much about his wife.

659
00:50:59,214 --> 00:51:00,964
I'm really envious.

660
00:51:00,964 --> 00:51:02,674
Geez, camping is not a big deal.

661
00:51:02,674 --> 00:51:04,874
If we have money, we should relax.

662
00:51:04,874 --> 00:51:06,704
We went to celebrate my promotion.

663
00:51:06,704 --> 00:51:08,244
We should go get some exercise together sometime.

664
00:51:08,244 --> 00:51:10,014
Do you all have a membership to Triad?

665
00:51:10,014 --> 00:51:12,124
I belong to High Slide. Can you pull some strings for me?

666
00:51:12,124 --> 00:51:14,104
Of course not!

667
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:15,844
Since it came up, shall we set the date then?

668
00:51:15,844 --> 00:51:17,044
- Yes, let's do that.
 - That's good!

669
00:51:17,044 --> 00:51:18,624
Let's just do it in the spring.

670
00:51:18,624 --> 00:51:22,104
It's called an attracting investment meeting, but it's not a big deal.

671
00:51:22,104 --> 00:51:27,484
It's a dinner gathering for people who love and show interest in Inner Spirit.

672
00:51:27,484 --> 00:51:31,694
So, the opportunity has finally shown up for us as well.

673
00:51:31,694 --> 00:51:33,804
I heard so many good things about it.

674
00:51:33,804 --> 00:51:38,684
I wonder if we have to prepare our funds and wait around in line with a number.

675
00:51:38,684 --> 00:51:40,544
 - Hello!
 - You're here!

676
00:51:40,544 --> 00:51:42,944
 - Please, come in. 
- They brought it.

677
00:51:51,814 --> 00:51:55,284
 It's pretty casual, so you can come comfortably.

678
00:52:13,834 --> 00:52:15,034
I'm sorry.

679
00:52:15,034 --> 00:52:17,304
Could someone please help clean up here?

680
00:52:17,304 --> 00:52:18,894
Are you all right?

681
00:52:22,364 --> 00:52:23,904
Don't drink too much.

682
00:52:23,904 --> 00:52:25,914
This isn't that kind of place.

683
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:31,924
Attorney Lee.

684
00:52:31,924 --> 00:52:34,284
Joo Yeon's Mom, long time no see.

685
00:52:34,284 --> 00:52:37,824
I was going to give you a call about something.

686
00:52:37,824 --> 00:52:40,034
You must be very busy these days.

687
00:52:40,034 --> 00:52:42,744
How dare you lay your hand on him!

688
00:52:42,744 --> 00:52:44,394
Shit.

689
00:52:45,654 --> 00:52:47,934
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

690
00:52:47,934 --> 00:52:50,504
She had a lot of wine.

691
00:52:50,504 --> 00:52:52,664
Na Yeong, let's go out for some fresh air.

692
00:52:52,664 --> 00:52:54,674
Let's get some fresh air.

693
00:52:54,674 --> 00:52:56,484
I'm sorry.

694
00:53:01,484 --> 00:53:03,164
Come here.

695
00:53:10,644 --> 00:53:15,794
Eight, seve, six, five,

696
00:53:15,794 --> 00:53:20,494
four, three, two, one, ding!

697
00:53:20,494 --> 00:53:22,324
Okay, I'm going to look for you!

698
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:24,194
Aigoo, where did they go?

699
00:53:24,194 --> 00:53:26,124
 Ji Yool! Ha Yool!

700
00:53:26,124 --> 00:53:28,454
 They're really fast!

701
00:53:28,454 --> 00:53:30,864
 When did they get so fast?

702
00:53:33,034 --> 00:53:35,134
Just how low can you go?

703
00:53:35,134 --> 00:53:37,054
How drunk do you want to get?

704
00:53:37,054 --> 00:53:39,364
Why were you still?

705
00:53:39,364 --> 00:53:42,474
- What?
 - How did it feel when she touched you?

706
00:53:42,474 --> 00:53:45,055
Did it feel good? Or was it electrifying?

707
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:48,225
- You've really lost it.
 - You're the crazy one.

708
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:50,574
How long must I tolerate this?

709
00:53:50,574 --> 00:53:52,304
Tell me! I said tell me!

710
00:53:52,304 --> 00:53:54,554
I'm sick and tired of your delusional jealousy!

711
00:53:54,554 --> 00:53:56,734
Why do you talk as if it's all my fault?

712
00:53:56,734 --> 00:54:00,034
- This is all because of you! 
- That's enough!

713
00:54:00,964 --> 00:54:04,244
 Another mom from the same class. A salesperson.

714
00:54:04,244 --> 00:54:06,624
 Today, it was the teacher.

715
00:54:06,624 --> 00:54:09,044
Another mom from the same class?

716
00:54:09,044 --> 00:54:11,574
You want to leave me, don't you?

717
00:54:11,574 --> 00:54:13,964
That's all you think about, right?

718
00:54:13,964 --> 00:54:15,774
But what can you do?

719
00:54:15,774 --> 00:54:18,734
I won't leave you even if it kills me!

720
00:54:39,454 --> 00:54:43,344
I give up! Come out!

721
00:54:43,344 --> 00:54:45,274
- Here! 
- Were you hiding there?

722
00:54:45,274 --> 00:54:47,154
That's amazing!

723
00:54:47,154 --> 00:54:49,524
- Ta-da!
 - I lost again! Oh, lost again!

724
00:54:49,524 --> 00:54:52,024
 Let's get him!

725
00:54:57,034 --> 00:54:59,794
- Where did you get this? 
- From the closet.

726
00:54:59,794 --> 00:55:02,224
Children shouldn't look at things like this.

727
00:55:02,224 --> 00:55:03,614
What is it?

728
00:55:03,614 --> 00:55:05,094
I want to see it, too.

729
00:55:05,094 --> 00:55:06,714
No, no.

730
00:55:11,354 --> 00:55:14,934
But is this your dad?

731
00:55:33,864 --> 00:55:38,414
 Kang Do Joon, Male/38 years old

732
00:55:51,094 --> 00:55:55,664
Delusional jealousy and anger management disorder.

733
00:55:55,664 --> 00:55:57,374
Out of anger...

734
00:55:58,584 --> 00:56:00,684
Is that possible?

735
00:56:01,734 --> 00:56:03,324
No.

736
00:56:03,324 --> 00:56:05,924
Why am I thinking about this?

737
00:56:14,544 --> 00:56:17,604
- You came back early. 
- Are the girls sleeping?

738
00:56:17,604 --> 00:56:19,374
It was tough, huh?

739
00:56:19,374 --> 00:56:21,694
If you're grateful, give me an explanation for

740
00:56:21,694 --> 00:56:25,064
Why you left in such a hurry, leaving the kids with me.

741
00:56:25,064 --> 00:56:26,624
I know, right?

742
00:56:28,344 --> 00:56:30,164
Something's off.

743
00:56:30,164 --> 00:56:32,274
I feel strange and uneasy.

744
00:56:33,844 --> 00:56:36,484
So, I'm doing something that's really unlike me.

745
00:56:36,484 --> 00:56:39,704
That's what I mean. What is that exactly?

746
00:56:47,874 --> 00:56:50,464
Oh, that's right. I didn't put this away.

747
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:59,030

748
00:57:00,304 --> 00:57:02,214
 I'm sick and tired of your delusional jealousy!

749
00:57:02,214 --> 00:57:04,409
 Why do you talk as if it's all my fault?

750
00:57:04,409 --> 00:57:07,709
 - This is all because of you!
 - That's enough!

751

 Violent Crimes Team 1

760
00:57:59,894 --> 00:58:02,174
 I don't think these photos should be overlooked.

761
00:58:02,174 --> 00:58:04,024
 Ji Yool, Ha Yool, are you ready?

762
00:58:04,024 --> 00:58:06,984
 I have to pack my bag, too.

763
00:58:07,954 --> 00:58:09,794
 The jewel was here!

764
00:58:09,794 --> 00:58:12,284
 There are many other victims besides me.

765
00:58:12,284 --> 00:58:13,764
 Do you still have that post?

766
00:58:13,764 --> 00:58:16,524
 I thought it was here somewhere...

767
00:58:16,524 --> 00:58:19,134
 It couldn't be over an affair or something, right?

768
00:58:19,134 --> 00:58:21,454
 Like mother, like daughter.

769
00:58:21,454 --> 00:58:24,214
 Even if you held a grudge against Yu Jin, how could you attack her kids?

770
00:58:24,214 --> 00:58:26,974
 Is she crazy? How dare you make me out to be a murderer?

771
00:58:26,974 --> 00:58:28,564
 Oh Yu Jin knew about it, right?

772
00:58:28,564 --> 00:58:31,394
 Even if it all came out, I'd just be embarrassed. I don't care.

773
00:58:31,394 --> 00:58:33,214
 But Eonni, it'd be more difficult for you. No?

774
00:58:33,214 --> 00:58:35,254
 I'll tell Jang Mi Ho everything!

775
00:58:35,254 --> 00:58:38,894
 Look how pathetic you are now.

776

 What are you doing here?

777

 Why did you lock this up?
