1
00:00:21,731 --> 00:00:22,857
Didn't I tell you?

2
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,775
You can never beat me.

3
00:00:25,151 --> 00:00:26,068
But then again,

4
00:00:26,152 --> 00:00:29,280
you never would've guessed
that you'd end up like this.

5
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:33,951
But I did.

6
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:38,622
You did?

7
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:40,875
I remembered…

8
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,005
Bo-ri.

9
00:00:46,756 --> 00:00:47,840
Bo-ri?

10
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:50,926
Through the memory…

11
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:55,514
of Park Jin-tae, who you killed.

12
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:07,485
How did you know
that I killed Park Jin-tae?

13
00:01:10,613 --> 00:01:11,655
Because…

14
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:16,535
I was once your brother,

15
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:20,080
Park Jin-tae.

16
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:08,212
EPISODE 6
MEMORY

17
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:23,519
Did you

18
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:25,938
get yourself killed on purpose?

19
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,915
Let's move on to the next life.

20
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:47,084
So you're getting your revenge
in your next life?

21
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,420
My mom once told me,

22
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,048
"Your sins will end up
finding their way back to you,

23
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:54,592
so don't ever commit them."

24
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:58,512
But I learned

25
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:01,348
that the sins of the rich

26
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:04,310
never seem to come back to them.

27
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:07,605
I'll make Park Tae-u pay for what he did.

28
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,565
The punished becomes the punisher?

29
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:12,484
That will only make you
pay a greater price.

30
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:14,862
I have to do something since God won't.

31
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:19,450
I'll show you that I can win
playing by the rules you've created.

32
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,118
When will you realize…

33
00:03:22,745 --> 00:03:23,746
that death

34
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:25,789
never goes as planned?

35
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:39,094
<i>What's this?</i>

36
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:40,346
<i>Why am I running?</i>

37
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:42,640
<i>Am I chasing that man?</i>

38
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:49,021
Stop chasing me, pig!

39
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,149
What? Pig?

40
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,736
Am I a cop, then?

41
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:59,198
Good.

42
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:00,866
What?

43
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,119
I'm going to kill you.

44
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,121
Wait.

45
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,458
Hold on.

46
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,918
Die!

47
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,002
Move out of the way!

48
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:23,472
Ji-hyeong.

49
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:25,015
Were you running away just now?

50
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:26,934
Well, you see…

51
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:29,979
I won't ask you to sacrifice yourself
for your partner.

52
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:32,648
But at the very least,
let's not embarrass ourselves.

53
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:34,650
Come on!

54
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:48,330
<i>My name is An Ji-hyeong.</i>

55
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:49,498
<i>I'm 42 years old.</i>

56
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:51,017
POLICE HOSPITAL FUNERAL HALL

57
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,626
<i>My father, who was a policeman,</i>

58
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,629
<i>died on duty while trying
to apprehend violent offenders,</i>

59
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:58,924
<i>and I wanted to be a great cop
just like my father.</i>

60
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:01,552
Mom! I passed the test.

61
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,762
I'm a policeman, just like Father.

62
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:04,847
What?

63
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:08,767
- Mom!
<i>- My mother fell sick with worry,</i>

64
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:12,104
<i>afraid that I might end up
dying like my father,</i>

65
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:15,149
<i>so I made a promise to her</i>

66
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,692
<i>that no matter what happened,</i>

67
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:19,528
<i>I would look after myself above all else.</i>

68
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:25,701
That punk always bails at crucial moments.

69
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,787
Consider yourself one officer short
when you're out with him.

70
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:31,623
<i>Keeping my promise to my mother</i>

71
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:33,959
- Jeez.
<i>- Turned me into a pathetic detective</i>

72
00:05:34,043 --> 00:05:35,794
<i>who was looked down on by his peers.</i>

73
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:37,755
<i>And recently…</i>

74
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:41,675
<i>my mother passed away.</i>

75
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:44,470
<i>All that was left for me</i>

76
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:48,140
<i>was the cold disdain of my colleagues,
who saw me as a selfish wimp.</i>

77
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:51,684
Excuse me.

78
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,480
Stay right there
if you want to keep your job.

79
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:58,984
<i>Even I began to believe
that was my true nature.</i>

80
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,279
<i>I belatedly realized
that a person's character is determined</i>

81
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,364
<i>not by the beliefs they hold,</i>

82
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:07,701
<i>but by the actions
over the course of their lifetime.</i>

83
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,626
I guess this man deserves some pity.

84
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,630
So that's why his junior detective

85
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:21,840
looked down on him like that.

86
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:30,224
Give me my money!

87
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:31,767
- Where's my money?
- Huh?

88
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,935
My money!

89
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,730
They promised me
100 million won if I kill you.

90
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:38,816
Just die, you bastard.

91
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,692
Give me my money!

92
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:42,653
- That bastard.
- Where is it?

93
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,905
Give me my 100 million won, you bastard!

94
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:46,865
Kim Ji-yeong.

95
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:48,992
Long time no see.

96
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:50,494
Who the hell are you?

97
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,454
You must love playing with knives.

98
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:54,790
Now you're just
pulling that thing out wherever.

99
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,083
Do you want to die too?

100
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,251
Technically,

101
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,878
you did get me once already.

102
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,256
What is this crazy bastard saying?

103
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,257
Who the hell are you?

104
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,340
Me?

105
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:08,095
My face may have changed a little,

106
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:11,682
but I'm Cho Tae-sang,
who you used to serve.

107
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:13,851
What?

108
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,894
What a load of bullshit.

109
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:18,814
I stabbed that bastard to death myself!

110
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:21,482
Wow.

111
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,069
That's a great way
of confessing to murder.

112
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,158
Fuck. Stop filming.

113
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,952
- I said, stop filming!
- Hey.

114
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:35,205
How many more people are you going to kill

115
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:37,416
for that 100 million won
Park Tae-u gave you?

116
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,334
Why you…

117
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,510
This man was just looking out for himself.

118
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:50,429
He wasn't weak at all.

119
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:54,349
That's enough.

120
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:56,685
Are you all right?

121
00:07:58,437 --> 00:07:59,605
I'm a detective.

122
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,399
- Damn it.
- Cuff him.

123
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,153
Stop glaring at me.

124
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,071
Take him to the station.

125
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,117
That was cool! You're the best!

126
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:20,167
KNIFE-WIELDING MAN IN MOKSU-DONG
SUBDUED WITH BARE HANDS

127
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,217
What the…

128
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,551
Can you believe this?

129
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:34,973
Why aren't you working on your cases?

130
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:36,600
What's with the huddle?

131
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:38,560
Sir, you should see this.

132
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:40,311
What is it?

133
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:45,651
That guy looks a lot like Ji-hyeong.

134
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,779
You may find this hard to believe,
but it <i>is</i> him.

135
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,198
Do you think I'm stupid?

136
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,041
Do you expect me to believe
that's Ji-hyeong?

137
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,660
Sir, it really is Detective An.

138
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:57,287
He's all the rage online right now.
They're calling him a hero.

139
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:58,372
What?

140
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,332
Hey, he's on the news as well.

141
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,234
JUNGBU POLICEMAN ARRESTS ARMED MAN

142
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:06,421
Check to see
if he recently got life insurance.

143
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:08,090
- Do it.
- Do it.

144
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:09,174
Do it.

145
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:10,759
Yes, sir.

146
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,469
You morons!

147
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,681
But where is he?

148
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:21,769
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

149
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:26,525
He said he wanted to visit
a serial murder suspect's home,

150
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:27,776
so I'm accompanying him.

151
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,946
We don't know for sure yet.

152
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,614
Yes, sir.

153
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:34,116
<i>Park Tae-u.</i>

154
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,994
<i>My revenge begins now.</i>

155
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:52,217
Sir, I got you the documents
you requested.

156
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:12,279
Why don't you join me for dinner tonight?

157
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,612
I'm sorry?

158
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:20,996
I've come across a great spot recently.

159
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,292
Why don't we go there?

160
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:28,669
Yes, sir.

161
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:33,050
I'm looking forward to
going to a place you like.

162
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:37,971
I feel the same way.

163
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:40,849
I've never gone there with a woman before.

164
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:02,996
Let's take my car.

165
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,414
Get ready.

166
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,375
Yes, sir.

167
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,428
I'll use that place as my playground.

168
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:23,474
Ji-hyeong.

169
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:26,103
Trespassing without a warrant
can get us into trouble!

170
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:29,064
It's fine. This house
doesn't have an owner anymore.

171
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,147
What?

172
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,026
Making creepy art
doesn't make you a serial killer.

AUTHOR LEE JI-SU

174
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:30,292
Ji-hyeong,
this place does seem a bit fishy.

175
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,252
What's that?

176
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:40,969
This is…

177
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:45,515
Jeong Gyu-cheol had a habit
of recording the murders he committed.

178
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:48,852
I'll get the forensics team.

179
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:56,860
<i>Now,</i>

180
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,445
<i>why don't you start begging me…</i>

181
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:01,906
<i>to spare you?</i>

00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,726
Spray the paintings as well.

185
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,773
Jeong Gyu-cheol used
the blood of his victims as paint.

186
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:40,570
Let's turn the lights off.

187
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,941
Hey.

188
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,067
An Ji-hyeong!

189
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:25,407
My detective instinct tells me…

190
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,494
that you're not An Ji-hyeong.

191
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:30,995
<i>What?</i>

192
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:32,330
<i>How did he know?</i>

193
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,667
Look me in the eyes!

194
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:39,504
You little shit…

195
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:40,588
Are you possessed?

196
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,924
Can you do magic tricks too?

197
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:44,426
Well done!

198
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:45,760
See?

199
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:47,846
I knew you had it in you.

200
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:51,600
<i>What's with him?</i>

201
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:52,684
Goodness.

202
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:00,567
Something must have happened here.

203
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,874
You're Mr. Park Tae-u of Taekang, correct?

204
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,500
That's right.

205
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,211
What's going on here?

206
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:22,672
I'm Detective An Ji-hyeong.

207
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:27,384
I like you.

208
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,305
You feed off the dead skin cells
of other people's feet.

209
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,144
You remember me, don't you?

210
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:41,816
We've blocked off the area
because of a murder that occurred nearby.

211
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,860
Have you ever heard this saying?

212
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,197
"Criminals…

213
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,034
always return to the scene of the crime."

214
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:56,915
I don't get

215
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,086
why you would say that to me.

216
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:06,341
I'm just warning you to stay away
so you're not mistaken as the culprit.

217
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:10,053
I'm only telling you this
because it's you.

218
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:11,805
May I ask

219
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:13,932
the name of your companion?

220
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:17,602
It's Lee Hui-u.

221
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:19,521
Why do you need my name?

222
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:22,982
We need to keep a record
of anyone who passes by the area.

223
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,192
Who knows?

224
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,237
You might end up going missing.

225
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:30,865
Killers don't walk around
wearing name tags, you see.

226
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,784
An ordinary-looking person

227
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:35,995
may be a hideous demon on the inside.

228
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:38,415
Isn't that right?

229
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,128
Am I free to go?

230
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:44,504
Of course.

231
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:01,730
I'll see you soon,

232
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:03,773
Park Tae-u.

233
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:11,488
Get out.

234
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:12,906
Sir.

235
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,951
I've lost my appetite, so get out.

236
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:26,004
An Ji-hyeong…

237
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,010
Detective An. Let us take a photo.

238
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:39,184
<i>The armed man arrested
by Detective An Ji-hyeong in Moksu-dong</i>

239
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:41,311
<i>shockingly turned out to be
the culprit of a murder</i>

240
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,271
<i>that happened a few days ago.</i>

241
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:44,189
<i>On top of that,</i>

242
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,553
<i>Detective An is finding himself
in the limelight once more</i>

243
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:48,902
<i>for uncovering the identity
of the elusive serial killer,</i>

244
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,528
<i>Jeong Gyu-cheol, the painter.</i>

245
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:52,947
<i>It was Detective An who discovered</i>

246
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,700
<i>that Jeong Gyu-cheol was the serial killer</i>

247
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:57,535
<i>behind 15 murders.</i>

248
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:59,871
<i>Saying that there is no perfect crime,</i>

249
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,707
<i>he expressed his will
to bring all criminals to justice</i>

250
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,751
<i>before the world.</i>

251
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:07,128
Yes.

252
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:08,296
Sir.

253
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,924
We've taken care of
Jeong Gyu-cheol's body.

254
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,008
Well done.

255
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,678
About Detective An Ji-hyeong…

256
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:20,517
It felt like he knew something.

257
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,186
DISARMING SOMEONE WITH A SHOULDER THROW

258
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,189
This guy is getting on my nerves.

259
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,107
I'll take care of him.

260
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,658
Thank you, Detective An.

261
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,078
We'll run it as an exclusive
on tonight's news.

262
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,288
I appreciate it.

263
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:43,747
Of course.

264
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,637
Your team was last
in terms of performance,

265
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:47,293
but you've done a good job as of late.

266
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:48,920
It's all thanks to you, sir.

267
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:49,838
Keep it up.

268
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:52,423
I'll give you a special promotion
if all of this ends well.

269
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:54,968
Thank you, sir!

270
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:58,930
JUNGBU POLICE STATION

271
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,101
Ji-hyeong, come here.

272
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:04,561
My baby.

273
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:09,148
Ji-hyeong. Can we talk?

274
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:10,775
Sure.

275
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:17,574
Keep up the good work!

276
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:25,582
I saw you

277
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:28,626
making copies of and deleting videos
in Jeong Gyu-cheol's room.

278
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:29,836
What?

279
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,212
What were those videos of?

280
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:39,637
They show who killed Jeong Gyu-cheol.

281
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,055
Was Jeong Gyu-cheol murdered?

282
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:42,140
Yes.

283
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:43,223
Then why would you…

284
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:44,350
Because the culprit…

285
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,604
was Park Tae-u.

286
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:49,981
As in Park Tae-u, the CEO of Taekang?

287
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:50,899
That's right.

288
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:51,983
So why…

289
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,777
Do you think they'd ever air those videos?

290
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:58,281
They'd be destroyed
the moment we brought them to the station.

291
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,449
I'll make sure

292
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,076
that bastard Park Tae-u

293
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,455
is brought to justice.

294
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:08,917
Ji-hyeong.

295
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:21,596
She's back again.

296
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:24,849
Is that investigation still going on?

297
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,315
What's she being investigated for?

298
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,250
Don't you know about the money bag case?

299
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,196
It even made the news
and caused quite a stir.

300
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:40,073
<i>That bag was found in her house.</i>

301
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,283
<i>They went through
all the security cameras in the area</i>

302
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,160
<i>and found out who put the bag in her home,</i>

303
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,536
<i>but he was found dead</i>

304
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,038
<i>from a traffic accident.</i>

305
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,666
It only ended up
putting her in a difficult spot.

306
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,043
I heard she even lost her son
not long ago.

307
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,089
Ma'am.

308
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,840
I can only let you go if you cooperate.

309
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,718
I really don't know.

310
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:03,221
Do you not remember?

311
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:06,224
I know nothing about this.

312
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:09,351
Jeez.

313
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:14,190
I can't do anything right,
even after I die.

314
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:36,211
Mom.

315
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:49,434
I'm sorry.

316
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,770
I was thinking of how to address you best

317
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:54,689
and ended up making a mistake.

318
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,191
I apologize, ma'am.

319
00:21:58,484 --> 00:21:59,610
It's fine.

320
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:05,283
It was nice to hear someone call me that.

321
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:14,667
One moment.

322
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:17,170
Gosh.

323
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:18,171
It's fine.

324
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,505
I'll do it myself.

325
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,717
You could get hurt
if you trip on your shoelaces.

326
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:24,802
You should wear

327
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:26,971
shoes without laces from now on.

328
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:32,351
This is the first pair of shoes
my son bought me.

329
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:39,567
Gosh.

330
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,903
You didn't have to prepare a gift.

331
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:42,986
Open it.

332
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:48,159
My goodness.

333
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:50,369
They're beautiful.

334
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:52,246
Thank you, son.

335
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,794
When I'm wearing these,

336
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:01,798
it feels like my son is still with me.

337
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:16,145
I'm sure your son…

338
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:22,026
wishes for your health and well-being.

339
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:26,531
Right. Thank you.

340
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:29,075
If I may,

341
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,454
why did you report that bag of money?

342
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,706
You should've just kept it.

343
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:43,589
Because it felt like
a punishment from the heavens.

344
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:46,926
A punishment?

345
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:51,472
A punishment for having failed
to save my own son.

346
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:59,730
It felt like I was being paid
in exchange for my son's life,

347
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:02,400
so I didn't want it.

348
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:09,115
He meant so much more
than all the money in the world.

349
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,121
Well, then.

350
00:24:57,413 --> 00:25:00,666

354
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:27,127
What is this?

355
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:30,006
Have you been digging up dirt on me?

356
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:34,510
All the pets we raised in this house

357
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,387
died very quickly.

358
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,680
And I know the reason why

359
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:42,143
because I'm your parent.

360
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:45,313
And now you're going after people...

361
00:26:45,396 --> 00:26:47,690
Is that why you sent me abroad
when I was a child

362
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,191
and kept tabs on me?

363
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:50,484
Were you ashamed of me?

364
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:54,196
Or…

365
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,576
did I scare you?

366
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,371
When I was young,

367
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:05,291
I used to love
reading books about royalty.

368
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,879
I could relate to them.

369
00:27:13,716 --> 00:27:15,092
In a royal family,

370
00:27:16,177 --> 00:27:17,720
blood-related siblings

371
00:27:18,012 --> 00:27:20,639
were adversaries
who had to fight to the death.

372
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:27,438
Their fathers were no exception.

373
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,404
Are you out of your mind,
you crazy bastard?

374
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:47,643
Once again,

375
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,354
I was the one who decided
whether someone lives or dies.

376
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:57,278
They call you the judge and the savior,

377
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,572
but you're nothing but an illusion.

378
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:02,867
Both judgment and salvation

379
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,410
are mine to give,

380
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:05,953
not you.

381
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:26,807
- Yes, Director?
<i>- Mr. Park.</i>

382
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:28,726
Our station received a tip-off

383
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,603
from Detective An Ji-hyeong

384
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:33,689
<i>that he had a video
of Jeong Gyu-cheol being murdered.</i>

385
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:34,772
And?

386
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:37,693
<i>He claims that the person who murdered him</i>

387
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,820
is you, Mr. Park.

388
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,575
<i>It looks like that video
will be aired on tonight's broadcast.</i>

389
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:46,035
<i>I'm sorry, sir.</i>

390
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,745
<i>I tried to stop it.</i>

391
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:48,828
All right.

392
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,290
Thank you for telling me.

393
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:06,055
MR. PARK TAE-U

394
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:12,978
<i>Have you dealt with An Ji-hyeong?</i>

395
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:14,688
Are you looking for me? How sweet.

396
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:18,859
- Who are you?
<i>- Me?</i>

397
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:23,405
An Ji-hyeong.

398
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:41,882
No way.

399
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:43,133
Gosh.

400
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:45,844
You seem to be on the slow side, Mr. Park.

401
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:50,224
Why don't we meet?

402
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:51,976
<i>I'll text you a location.</i>

403
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:53,852
That's not how it works.

404
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,564
You suggested it.
Shouldn't you come to me?

405
00:31:00,985 --> 00:31:02,653
Then where should I go?

406
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:04,738
Come down to the station.

407
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:05,906
<i>The police station.</i>

408
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:08,617
Right.

409
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:12,204
All your wrongdoings
must make you scared to come here.

410
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:19,253
<i>Let's see, then.</i>

411
00:31:19,587 --> 00:31:22,214
I'll go to where you are
after the evening news is over.

412
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,049
I couldn't help but notice

413
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,760
that you only wore luxury brands.

414
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:28,512
I'll specially prepare

415
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:30,931
a pair of German handcuffs for you.

416
00:31:31,015 --> 00:31:34,393
- You son of a bitch...
- What a dirty mouth.

417
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:36,811
Name.

418
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:38,981
- You caught me.
- Answer me.

419
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:42,401
You go catch them.

420
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:50,784
He's doing all the work he hasn't done
for the last 12 years,

421
00:31:50,868 --> 00:31:51,869
all in this week.

422
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:53,370
But what's this?

423
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:57,875
Why do I get the feeling
that something's about to go wrong?

424
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,502
It doesn't feel right.

425
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:06,716
Hello?

426
00:32:07,468 --> 00:32:08,719
Yes, Commissioner General.

427
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:11,430
An Ji-hyeong?

428
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,644
THE PEOPLE'S POLICE

429
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:28,155
- It was so tough in there.
- Are you okay?

430
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:29,448
Goodness.

431
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:48,467
Well then,

432
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:50,928
I'll leave you to it, Mr. Park.

433
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:54,390
Thank you, Commissioner General.

434
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:02,773
I didn't expect you
to come all the way here.

435
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:07,986
We truly have a special bond.

436
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:10,364
It's more like a curse.

437
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:17,621
My guess is that
you aren't here to turn yourself in.

438
00:33:17,705 --> 00:33:18,789
So why are you here?

439
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:24,420
I want to negotiate a deal with you.

440
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:25,587
What?

441
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:27,715
What is it that you want?

442
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:28,841
Money?

443
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:30,509
Prestige?

444
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:31,759
Connections?

445
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:36,515
Why don't you read through this
and sign it?

446
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:40,144
If you just look the other way,

447
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:42,896
you'll get many more benefits
in the years to come.

448
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,566
You could even end up
sitting in this office

449
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:48,026
if you swallow your pride
and cozy up to me.

450
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:09,214
I don't need things
like money or prestige.

451
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:16,597
Then what is it that you want?

452
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:19,099
You.

453
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,146
This is all I have.

454
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:28,328
I want you to bet everything you have too.

455
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,572
What do you get out of doing all this?

456
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:36,825
The satisfaction of teaching
a maniac who thinks he's a god

457
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:40,913
that he's nothing more
than a crazed lunatic.

458
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:44,374
This entire country is my playground.

459
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:47,002
You're just a stray dog
running about in it,

460
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,545
having forgotten your place.

461
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:50,631
I'll shit all over your playground then.

462
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:53,926
Putting down a stray dog like you
isn't a big deal for me.

463
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:56,261
If you keep this up...

464
00:34:56,345 --> 00:34:57,888
The worst that happens is I die.

465
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,227
You must think you have nine lives.

466
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:06,063
Nice.

467
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:08,690
I see that you're not completely clueless.

468
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:11,693
Let's put an end…

469
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:16,031
to our cursed bond in this life.

470
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,324
It'll happen…

471
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:21,245
whether you want it to or not.

472
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:23,302
Meet me on the first floor in 30 minutes.

473
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:25,374
I'll cuff you then.

474
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:37,678
I'll have Detective Lee take care of this.

475
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:46,728
Yes, sir.

476
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:00,534
Understood.

477
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,270
<i>A man was found dead
after having bled to death</i>

478
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:29,938
<i>on a deserted road.</i>

479
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:34,359
<i>The driver was found
with a stab wound on his neck.</i>

480
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:38,071
<i>He was found to have been drunk
at the time of his passing.</i>

481
00:36:38,155 --> 00:36:39,239
I've heated it up.

482
00:36:39,323 --> 00:36:41,301
- Caring, aren't I?
- <i>There were no security cameras.</i>

483
00:36:41,325 --> 00:36:43,785
- Right. Enjoy it.
<i>- Furthermore, the car's dashcam</i>

484
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:45,787
<i>was missing its memory card.</i>

485
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:48,123
<i>To help solve the case,</i>

486
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,292
- It's about to begin.
<i>- Police are waiting for</i>

487
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,878
- That's right.
<i>- Possible witnesses to come forward.</i>

488
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:55,714
MAN IN HIS FORTIES
FOUND DEAD ON A DESERTED ROAD

489
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:56,797
<i>This just in.</i>

490
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,592
<i>Park Tae-u, Taekang's CEO,</i>

491
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:01,070
<i>will be turning himself in
for the murder of Jeong Gyu-cheol,</i>

492
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:02,387
<i>the serial killer.</i>

493
00:37:02,471 --> 00:37:04,765
- What the…
<i>- More from our reporter at the scene.</i>

494
00:37:06,642 --> 00:37:08,018
- There he is.
- Here he comes.

495
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:23,408
I murdered Jeong Gyu-cheol…

496
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:27,747
a serial killer
who took the lives of 15 victims.

497
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:32,376
<i>A few days ago…</i>

498
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:34,139
TAEKANG CEO PARK'S URGENT PRESS CONFERENCE

499
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:35,212
<i>…I was kidnapped.</i>

500
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:37,839
<i>I was taken somewhere,
not knowing what was going on.</i>

501
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:40,008
<i>I only found out after I got there</i>

502
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:42,636
<i>that the man who kidnapped me
was Jeong Gyu-cheol,</i>

503
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:46,598
<i>the serial killer
who took 15 people's lives.</i>

504
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:48,892
<i>That's when I realized</i>

505
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:52,020
that I was given

506
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:54,439
the first and final chance

507
00:37:54,815 --> 00:37:56,483
to bring that serial killer to justice.

508
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:59,194
Are you saying you killed him
to punish him for his crimes?

509
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:01,571
I was left with two options.

510
00:38:01,655 --> 00:38:04,783
Kill him or be killed by him.

511
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:06,368
That was it.

512
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:08,412
And I felt

513
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:12,249
that it was my responsibility

514
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:15,794
to put a stop to his senseless killings.

515
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:18,171
Then where is Jeong Gyu-cheol's body?

516
00:38:19,256 --> 00:38:20,298
That's the one thing

517
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:22,384
I'm unsure of.

518
00:38:22,843 --> 00:38:24,720
I thought I had killed him

519
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:27,931
while I was struggling against him.

520
00:38:28,015 --> 00:38:31,018
I was deeply confused when I saw the news

521
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:33,562
that his body hadn't been found.

522
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:36,648
<i>I offer my sincerest apologies</i>

523
00:38:37,024 --> 00:38:39,151
<i>for letting down
the people of this country.</i>

524
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,451
And I don't know when it will be,

525
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:50,245
but if I ever get another chance,

526
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:53,165
<i>I will follow my life motto</i>

527
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:56,293
<i>and give back</i>

528
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:59,421
<i>as much as I have received.</i>

529
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,095
<i>Are you saying
your actions were justified?</i>

530
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,724
<i>That was the report from the scene.</i>

531
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:12,893
We will now show you exclusive footage

532
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:16,897
that allegedly shows Mr. Park
murdering Jeong Gyu-cheol.

533
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:23,820
EXCLUSIVE FOOTAGE
OF PARK TAE-U KILLING JEONG GYU-CHEOL

534
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:32,120
<i>As you can see,
that's all there is to the footage.</i>

535
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:33,121
What?

536
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:35,791
<i>This footage isn't enough
to be put forward as evidence</i>

537
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:38,001
<i>that Mr. Park murdered Jeong Gyu-cheol.</i>

538
00:39:38,085 --> 00:39:41,379
<i>We are only left with suspicions
that he may still be alive.</i>

539
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:45,342
<i>The footage only proves
that Mr. Park had been kidnapped,</i>

540
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:47,052
<i>as he has previously stated…</i>

541
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:49,846
We've already decided
to dismiss all your charges.

542
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:52,724
I'm sorry to have troubled you today.

543
00:39:52,808 --> 00:39:55,852
Oh, not at all. Please don't say that.

544
00:39:55,936 --> 00:39:58,688
You've done so much for us over the years.

545
00:39:59,189 --> 00:40:00,899
We are forever in your debt.

546
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:01,982
That's right.

547
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:06,738
MEDIA MANAGEMENT MANUAL

548
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,284
Tell every media outlet
that we'll pull all our ads

549
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:14,162
if they write
a single negative thing about us!

550
00:40:15,122 --> 00:40:16,581
Park Tae-u is innocent!

551
00:40:16,665 --> 00:40:18,583
- He's innocent!
- He's innocent!

552
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:20,168
All members of our party

553
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:24,381
- believe that Mr. Park Tae-u is innocent!
- Believe that Mr. Park Tae-u is innocent!

554
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:26,341
Many civic groups and politicians

555
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,385
have expressed
their support for Mr. Park Tae-u.

556
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:30,846
You fabricated evidence
and leaked it to the press.

557
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,639
Ruin your life all you want.

558
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:35,016
But why drag me into this?

559
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,394
I didn't fabricate evidence.

560
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:38,979
Why do the press and the police

561
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:42,399
keep saying that all the evidence
against Park Tae-u is fabricated?

562
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:45,652
That's why people like Park Tae-u
think the entire world is a joke.

563
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:46,735
What did you say?

564
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:49,072
Please calm down, sir.
He was only trying to…

565
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:51,741
You'll both be fired!

566
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,202
Chief!

567
00:40:57,497 --> 00:41:00,217
<i>Reports of Jeong Gyu-cheol sightings
have continued to flow in today.</i>

568
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:01,793
<i>Was he truly murdered?</i>

569
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:03,670
<i>With Jeong Gyu-cheol's body missing,</i>

570
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:06,256
<i>Mr. Park Tae-u is scheduled
to be released today</i>

571
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:09,759
<i>due to a lack of circumstantial evidence
backing his admission of guilt.</i>

572
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:19,269
It was a great story.

573
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,520
But

574
00:41:22,272 --> 00:41:23,857
I decide how it ends.

575
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:30,155
There's even a greater ending
waiting for you.

576
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,866
I always give back as much as I receive.

577
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:51,968
- Park Tae-u!
- Park Tae-u!

578
00:41:52,469 --> 00:41:55,347
- Park Tae-u!
- Park Tae-u!

579
00:41:55,764 --> 00:42:01,853
- Park Tae-u!
- Park Tae-u!

580
00:42:03,772 --> 00:42:06,858
Sir. Should I delay
your flight to the States?

581
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:10,028
No. Proceed as planned.

582
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:11,403
Yes, sir.

583
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:31,967
Go ahead.

584
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:32,884
<i>Mr. Park.</i>

585
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:35,409
There weren't any copies of the video
in An Ji-hyeong's home.

586
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:38,515
And I've managed to capture him.

587
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:41,851
Keep him alive.

588
00:42:41,935 --> 00:42:44,020
I'm going to deal with him myself.

589
00:42:44,104 --> 00:42:45,104
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

590
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:31,359
What's going on?

591
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:39,617
<i>Park Tae-u.</i>

592
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:41,995
<i>I know you killed
more than just Jeong Gyu-cheol.</i>

593
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:44,831
<i>You also killed Park Jin-tae,
Song Jae-seop, Cho Tae-sang,</i>

594
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:48,251
<i>Jang Geon-u, Lee Ji-su, and Lee Su-yeon.</i>

595
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:52,422
<i>You will pay for your sins.</i>

596
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:53,590
Who are you?

597
00:44:02,015 --> 00:44:03,558
What the hell?

598
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:04,641
What's going on?

599
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,732
<i>You killed your brother Park Jin-tae
and disguised it as an accident.</i>

600
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:13,026
<i>And then,
to distract the press and the public</i>

601
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:15,111
<i>from taking an interest in his death,</i>

602
00:44:15,195 --> 00:44:17,614
<i>you offered Song Jae-seop
three billion won,</i>

603
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:19,057
<i>which you knew he couldn't refuse.</i>

604
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:21,785
<i>You had him jump from 8 000 m up
without a parachute</i>

605
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:23,620
<i>to his death.</i>

606
00:44:24,371 --> 00:44:27,624
<i>This plane will explode in 30 seconds,</i>

607
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:29,793
<i>just like when Park Jin-tae died.</i>

608
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:31,460
What?

609
00:44:31,503 --> 00:44:35,215
<i>Song Jae-seop jumped without a parachute,
but I'll give you a chance.</i>

610
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:38,843
<i>Jump off this plane with a parachute
if you wish to live.</i>

611
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:39,969
A parachute?

612
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:03,867
Damn it.

613
00:45:06,996 --> 00:45:08,415
Where's the parachute?

614
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:10,707
Shit!

615
00:47:17,627 --> 00:47:18,627
What the hell?

616
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:21,548
What are you doing here?

617
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:34,185
<i>But if I ever get another chance…</i>

618
00:47:34,269 --> 00:47:35,103
ONE WEEK AGO

619
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:37,855
<i>…I will follow my life motto</i>

620
00:47:37,939 --> 00:47:38,982
<i>and give back…</i>

621
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:41,192
TAEKANG CEO PARK'S URGENT PRESS CONFERENCE

622
00:47:41,276 --> 00:47:42,694
<i>…as much as I have received.</i>

623
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,492
<i>He's acting exactly
the way I expected him to.</i>

624
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:51,869
<i>Thank you, Park Tae-u.</i>

625
00:47:51,953 --> 00:47:54,706
<i>You've raised the stakes for this round.</i>

626
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:57,375
<i>Since the world
won't bring you to justice,</i>

627
00:47:57,458 --> 00:48:00,837
<i>I'll use their memories
to bring you to justice myself.</i>

628
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:04,007
The only thing we can trust
in our line of work is this.

629
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:08,469
This hard drive contains
all the dirt we collected on our clients.

630
00:48:19,856 --> 00:48:22,275
All of your sins

631
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:24,360
will find their way back to you.

632
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:31,492
<i>Through Park Jin-tae's memory,</i>

633
00:48:31,576 --> 00:48:35,079
<i>I learned that Park Tae-u
stored narcotics in his fountain pen.</i>

634
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:38,499
<i>I swapped them out with sleeping pills.</i>

635
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:40,710
And I've managed to capture him.

636
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:42,253
<i>Keep him alive.</i>

637
00:48:42,337 --> 00:48:44,297
<i>I'm going to deal with him myself.</i>

638
00:48:45,298 --> 00:48:46,298
Yes, sir.

639
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,227
<i>Using Lee Ju-hun's memory,</i>

640
00:48:58,311 --> 00:49:00,229
<i>I installed a bomb in the plane's engine</i>

641
00:49:00,313 --> 00:49:01,689
<i>and made the plane take off.</i>

642
00:49:08,237 --> 00:49:10,406
<i>After that, I used Song Jae-seop's memory</i>

643
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:12,617
<i>to throw a counterpunch.</i>

644
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:15,370
<i>This will make a bigger impact</i>

645
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:17,580
<i>after Park Tae-u
raised the stakes himself.</i>

646
00:49:17,664 --> 00:49:20,792
We'll now show you the videos
related to Mr. Park Tae-u.

EVIDENCE OF PARK TAE-U'S MURDERS SECURED

648
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:26,714
<i>Isn't this your brother?</i>

649
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:31,427
<i>Brother, my ass.</i>

650
00:49:33,262 --> 00:49:35,056
<i>Make his death look like an accident.</i>

651
00:49:37,517 --> 00:49:38,685
Along with the video

652
00:49:38,768 --> 00:49:42,063
of Mr. Park Tae-u ordering a hit
on his brother Park Jin-tae,

653
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:45,608
a video of him confessing to murder
was also uploaded.

654
00:49:45,692 --> 00:49:48,528
<i>But no matter how many people
I ran over after that,</i>

655
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:50,738
<i>I couldn't experience
the sensation I had felt then.</i>

656
00:49:50,822 --> 00:49:52,949
<i>How did you know
that I killed Park Jin-tae?</i>

657
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:53,908
<i>Along with the videos,</i>

658
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,493
<i>there was a release of evidence</i>

659
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:58,913
<i>proving that the Commissioner General
and high-ranking police officers</i>

660
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:02,041
<i>covered up Mr. Park Tae-u's crimes
in exchange for bribes.</i>

661
00:51:05,188 --> 00:51:06,272
What the hell?

662
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:09,275
What are you doing here?

663
00:51:17,992 --> 00:51:19,786
You're not the one who gets to decide

664
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:21,621
how this story ends.

665
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,750
Every good story

666
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:28,461
always has a twist.

667
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:04,914
You acted as if you were a god.

668
00:52:05,832 --> 00:52:07,124
How do you feel now?

669
00:52:12,755 --> 00:52:14,298
You killed Ji-su.

670
00:52:14,382 --> 00:52:15,716
You murdered her!

671
00:52:22,974 --> 00:52:24,141
Park Tae-u,

672
00:52:24,225 --> 00:52:25,643
let's go to hell together.

673
00:52:58,801 --> 00:52:59,886
Whatever.

674
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:02,722
Screw Death's rules!

675
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:04,389
I don't give a fuck.

676
00:53:04,432 --> 00:53:06,267
