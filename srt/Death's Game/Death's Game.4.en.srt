EPISODE 4
THE REASON YOU'RE AFRAID OF DEATH

2
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:40,750
Where's the baby's mother?

3
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:53,095
My baby.

4
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:55,347
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,267
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:58,642 --> 00:00:59,852
I'm so sorry.

7
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:02,062
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,440
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:05,566
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:07,193 --> 00:01:08,194
<i>My money.</i>

11
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:10,154
<i>My ten billion won.</i>

12
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:23,709
<i>This woman must be the baby's mother.</i>

13
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:28,714
<i>The answer was "November 19, World Day</i>
<i>for the Prevention of Child Abuse."</i>

14
00:01:28,798 --> 00:01:31,300
<i>Did you know that every five minutes,</i>

15
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:34,762
<i>a child somewhere in the world</i>
<i>dies due to abuse?</i>

16
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,264
Why won't you shut up and sleep?

17
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:40,518
I can't even have a fucking cup of coffee
because of you!

18
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:48,692
<i>What's wrong with her?</i>

19
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:05,209
- You're home.
- Feed him.

20
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:11,799
Why are you lying down?

21
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:13,384
It's time for your meal.

22
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,262
<i>The dad seems nice, thankfully.</i>

23
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,223
<i>Hey, your wife is insane.</i>

24
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:20,724
<i>- Did you know that?</i>
- What the…

25
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:23,477
This expired four months ago.

26
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:24,728
It's fine. He won't die.

27
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:31,944
I guess you're right.

28
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:35,114
It's not like you can taste it.

29
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:36,699
<i>What's wrong with these people?</i>

30
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:40,160
Here comes a tasty meal.

31
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:41,787
- So yummy.
<i>- I won't eat it.</i>

32
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,247
<i>I won't!</i>

33
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,916
Are you kidding me?

34
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,336
Stop spitting it out, damn it.

35
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:52,381
Why can't I rest when I'm home, you brat?

36
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:54,675
You're pissing me off!

37
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:03,976
What's the police doing here again?

38
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,186
<i>What? The police?</i>

39
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:07,605
The police are here?

40
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:09,523
Let's get this off you.

41
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:22,536
I'm here with child protective services

42
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,288
due to a report of child abuse.

43
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,457
Excuse me? Did you just say child abuse?

44
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,083
What report?

45
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:29,627
The pediatric hospital

46
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,212
reported that they saw
signs of abuse on the child's body.

47
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:33,130
What?

48
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,465
We'll need to take a look.

49
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:36,592
Excuse me.

50
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:41,263
Here.

51
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:44,183
Why would they say that?

52
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:45,559
I'll take a look at your child.

53
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:47,770
<i>I think my rib is broken.</i>

54
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,105
<i>My heart also hurts very much.</i>

55
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:51,065
Honey.

56
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,692
How could they suspect us
of something like this?

57
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:55,861
Does it look like we'd beat our own child?

58
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:03,661
KIM SEOK-JAE
NATIONAL CENTER FOR CHILD WELFARE

59
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,371
I also work in child welfare.

60
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:20,260
There must have been a misunderstanding.

61
00:04:21,804 --> 00:04:24,473
We were just following procedure here.

62
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,892
Yes. Please don't be upset.

63
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:27,810
Right.

64
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:29,436
Let's go to the next house.

65
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:30,938
<i>No, you can't leave!</i>

66
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,527
Gosh, he sure has a loud voice.

67
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,362
You'll give your mom so much trouble.

68
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:40,406
<i>Please help me.</i>

69
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:42,574
<i>Help!</i>

70
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:50,457
We're sorry for the intrusion.

71
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,606
What did I ever do
to have the cops called on us?

72
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:17,943
Who the hell do you think you are?

73
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,040
You know what?

74
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:34,251
Nothing has worked out for me
ever since you were born.

75
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:37,046
It's all your fault.

76
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:28,305
Why wasn't there
a memory orb for that baby?

77
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:29,932
Since he never had

78
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:31,600
any memories or abilities.

79
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,270
I don't even know that baby's name

80
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:37,356
since nobody called him by his name!

81
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,443
How can such parents exist?

82
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:44,988
- If they're parents, they should--
- They should what?

83
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,615
No one is guaranteed anything in life.

84
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:49,243
You've just been taking
everything for granted.

85
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:52,538
You didn't care for life
and chose death so flippantly,

86
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:53,705
but that baby

87
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,208
didn't even get to make a choice.

88
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,252
There are many others like that
in the world.

89
00:06:58,752 --> 00:06:59,920
Damn it!

90
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,007
Shit.

91
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,469
All right.

92
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:09,555
Hurry and shoot me.

93
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,098
I wonder why you're in such a hurry.

94
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,182
Shoot me!

95
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:17,646
Humans always struggle to live
only after they die,

96
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:20,065
not while they are still alive.

97
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,192
<i>Just shoot me already.</i>

98
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:23,402
<i>You can hear me, right?</i>

99
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:26,822
<i>You don't care at all</i>
<i>what I end up doing anyway.</i>

100
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,282
<i>You're right. </i>

101
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:29,992
<i>I don't care what you do.</i>

102
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,410
What?

103
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:32,828
Why not?

104
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,621
Seeing your actions thus far,

105
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:37,249
you will end up dying
no matter how much you struggle.

106
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,502
But if you ever try to kill someone,

107
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:43,380
I will intervene.

108
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,382
What do you take me for?

109
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:47,009
Why would I kill someone?

110
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:49,428
That won't ever happen,

111
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,346
so let's move on to my next life.

112
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:55,058
Sure. If you want to die that badly.

113
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,695
<i>I need to find the money first.</i>

114
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:08,989
<i>What's the date today?</i>

115
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,242
<i>Where's my phone?</i>

116
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,495
<i>Here it is.</i>

117
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:18,582
<i>"April 6, 8:45 p.m."?</i>

118
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,126
<i>Then the money will be gone in 15 minutes.</i>

119
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,296
<i>And where the hell am I?</i>

120
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,731
I'm sorry!

121
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,238
I'm sorry.

122
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:50,822
No, it's fine.

123
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:55,035
Damn it.

124
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:04,503
Wait!

125
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:05,921
Could you hold on?

126
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,798
Please wait. I need to get my things.

127
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,841
One, two, zero, one.

128
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,222
It's mine.

129
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:16,807
Keep up the good work.

130
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:25,983
That was close.

131
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,863
You're one handsome devil.

132
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:33,240
Wait.

133
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:35,117
Why is my voice so soothing?

134
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:49,840
This guy

135
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,508
must be a model.

136
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:01,810
Come on.

137
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,859
<i>My name is Jang Geon-u. I'm 24 years old.</i>

138
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,570
- Happy birthday, Geon-u!
- <i>Since my childhood,</i>

139
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,905
<i>I was loved by everyone</i>
<i>because of my looks.</i>

140
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:16,658
<i>I was often the first crush of girls</i>

141
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:18,577
<i>that many boys had crushes on.</i>

142
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:22,372
<i>Money came easily thanks to my good looks,</i>

143
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:26,168
<i>and I've been living aimlessly</i>
<i>while modeling to make a living.</i>

144
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:35,552
He has money as well as good looks.

145
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,392
No way!

146
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,736
It's gold.

147
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,199
The young guy sure has a lot of money.

148
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:00,952
Look at that.

149
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,498
FIVE-MONTH INFANT FOUND DEAD!
PARENTS ARRESTED FOR ABUSE

150
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:09,211
So the abuse and murder
came to light in the end.

151
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:11,588
I wonder how many years they'll serve.

152
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,508
I wish I could go to the police
and testify against them.

153
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,885
Those rotten bastards.

154
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:25,102
"Serial killer at large."

155
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,978
"Arson."

156
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:28,313
"Traffic accident."

157
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,569
I wonder how this man is going to die.

158
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:36,363
Arson?

159
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:37,906
A traffic accident?

160
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:39,783
Maybe he's terminally ill.

161
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:43,537
Man, it's such a headache.

162
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:52,421
"Seok-jin."

163
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:55,924
Who the heck are you?

164
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:58,552
- Hello?
<i>- You're coming, right?</i>

165
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:01,721
Where?

166
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,058
Where else? The VIP party
we're supposed to attend tonight.

167
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,227
- "The VIP party"?
<i>- That's right.</i>

168
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,603
Hurry up.

169
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:11,314
All the prettiest girls in Korea
must be gathered here tonight.

170
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:12,732
Pretty girls?

171
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,986
<i>Right. It would be better to be at a party</i>

172
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,071
<i>than to worry about dying.</i>

173
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:19,990
Sure. I'll be there right away.

174
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:22,659
They say you only live once.

175
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,546
- Bottoms up!
- Cheers!

176
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,388
I can usually drink much more than this.

177
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:45,974
Hey.

178
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,478
Why'd you drink so much
when you're a total lightweight?

179
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:50,812
I am?

180
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:52,856
No wonder.

181
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:53,899
Damn it.

182
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,984
The host of tonight's party is here.

183
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,903
If you get on his good side,

184
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,530
you could end up modeling for Taekang.

185
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:02,365
- Taekang?
- Yeah.

186
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:05,911
<i>Presenting the host of tonight's party,</i>

187
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:08,205
<i>CEO Park Tae-u.</i>

188
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:27,933
Sir.

189
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,351
Nice to meet you.

190
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:30,810
- Long time, no see.
- This is my friend.

191
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:32,020
He's a model.

192
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,188
- Is that so?
- Yes, sir.

193
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:34,856
He sure is handsome.

194
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,024
Hey, wait.

195
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:39,444
Haven't we met before?

196
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,113
Well,

197
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:44,074
I'm not sure.

198
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:45,909
- I'm sure we've met--
- Gosh.

199
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,536
We've met before.

200
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:49,955
He seems drunk already.

201
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:53,458
Enjoy yourself.

202
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:55,377
Wait…

203
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:03,593
Whatever.

204
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:05,887
Let's forget everything…

205
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,016
and party hard!

206
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:30,495
Hey.

207
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:31,871
Get up.

208
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:32,956
Jeez. Hey.

209
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,958
What are you doing?
You didn't answer my calls.

210
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,131
<i>This man</i>

211
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:43,717
<i>must be Jang Geon-u's older brother.</i>

212
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,346
Have you been drinking?

213
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,181
What? Yes. Why do you ask?

214
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,976
Seriously? Hey.

215
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,604
You promised to man the café
while I went to the States for a week.

216
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,439
- What?
- Pull yourself together.

217
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:59,232
- Wait.
- Get up.

218
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:00,900
Get up and get washed up.

219
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:02,319
- Hurry.
- Okay.

220
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:08,783
What a bother.

221
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:21,713
Here you go.

222
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,007
Look at you.

223
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,635
Why'd you drink so much
when you're a lightweight?

224
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,386
I'm sorry.

225
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:30,972
<i>I'll just work today</i>

226
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:33,892
<i>and leave first thing</i>
<i>when he goes abroad tomorrow.</i>

227
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,562
Let's do some cleaning.

228
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:38,897
Hey, we've got a customer.

229
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,191
Welcome.

230
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:11,471
<i>You're the only one I love.</i>

231
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:12,389
<i>I love you.</i>

232
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,891
<i>Right here. This is my boyfriend.</i>

233
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:02,188
"<i>First Love</i>."

234
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:05,150
"Written by Lee Ji-su."

235
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:08,153
Excuse me.

236
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:25,170
I'll come get it.

237
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:30,300
Okay.

238
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,198
<i>Let's just end it here.</i>

239
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:55,825
<i>I've put you through so much.</i>

240
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:57,327
<i>Have a good life.</i>

241
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:11,299
What can I get you?

242
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:13,218
- One hot citron tea, please.
- Sure thing.

243
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:57,387
Just act natural.

244
00:18:58,346 --> 00:18:59,305
"Enjoy your drink."

245
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,307
Enjoy…

246
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:10,400
Enjoy your drink.

247
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,323
I'm so sorry.

248
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:21,244
There.

249
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:24,789
Hey.

250
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,083
Do you have a thing for her?

251
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:28,418
What?

252
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:30,545
No.

253
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:32,505
Wait.

254
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,300
Does she come here often?

255
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:37,427
Almost every day.

256
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,262
She comes around this time
and stays until closing.

257
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,472
Every day?

258
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:45,018
<i>If she comes here every day,</i>
<i>what about her work?</i>

259
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:46,936
Right, I hear she's a writer.

260
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:49,480
- She's a writer?
- Yes.

261
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:50,732
A novelist.

262
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:52,609
A novelist?

263
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:59,073
AUTHOR LEE JI-SU

264
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:04,537
LEE JI-SU'S <i>TO YOU IN THE FUTURE</i>
WINS THE 15TH <i>YEJU DAILY</i> WRITER'S CONTEST

265
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:08,458
"The winning piece, <i>To You in the Future</i>,

266
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,668
was published as a novel."

267
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:14,505
"When asked who came to mind first
when she won the contest,

268
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:15,840
Ms. Lee Ji-su answered…"

269
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:18,343
<i>The person who comes to mind?</i>

270
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:24,641
The only person
who rooted for me and my dream

271
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:27,310
is my boyfriend.

272
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:32,899
That's why I thought of him first.

273
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:35,318
How did your boyfriend react?

274
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:40,156
He's been going through a lot these days.

275
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:43,451
I haven't told him I won just yet,

276
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:47,163
but I'm sure he'll be happy for me
when he hears the news.

277
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:50,124
<i>Ji-su.</i>

278
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,543
Should I just let you go now?

279
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:54,837
Look at our relationship.

280
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:56,381
Are you really okay

281
00:20:58,424 --> 00:20:59,467
with how things are?

282
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:04,138
<i>Then that envelope must have been</i>
<i>her prize money.</i>

283
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:20,780
I need to step outside for a bit.

284
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:24,075
Hey. Where are you going?

285
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,918
NEW RELEASES

<i>TO YOU IN THE FUTURE</i>

287
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:55,523
Here. It's hot citron tea.

288
00:21:58,109 --> 00:21:59,277
Thanks.

289
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:03,990
You're working hard.

290
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:06,868
The contest deadline is coming up.

291
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:11,789
By the way, Ji-su,

292
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:13,791
what's it like to be writing a novel?

293
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:17,336
It feels as if
I'm standing completely naked

294
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,839
in front of the people who read my novel.

295
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:20,757
What?

296
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:22,925
Why is that?

297
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:25,762
Even if what I write is fictitious,

298
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:31,309
I can't help but write
using my thoughts and experiences.

299
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:35,354
<i>I finally got to understand</i>

300
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,565
<i>why Ji-su said that</i>

301
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:39,484
<i>as I was reading her novel.</i>

302
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:42,070
<i>It was because</i>
<i>a few of the scenes in her novel</i>

303
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:46,699
<i>were based on</i>
<i>actual experiences Ji-su and I had.</i>

304

BH COMMUNICATION NEW EMPLOYEE INTERVIEW

305
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:52,747
Ms. Lee!

306
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:54,499
Here's your coffee.

307
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:55,666
Thank you.

308
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,085
What are you doing this weekend?

309
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:59,962
I've got two tickets
to the play you wanted to see.

310
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:01,672
Do you want to go with me?

311
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:03,049
I have plans this weekend.

312
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:04,801
What about tonight, then?

313
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:08,971
Tae-sik tells me

314
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,974
that you're popular
with the men at your workplace.

315
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:15,061
Why would he tell you that?

316
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:17,688
Leave me if you want.

317
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:20,650
What?

318
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,403
But if you do, you'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

319
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:26,322
Because I'll end up

320
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:30,451
even more successful than anyone
who's hitting on you right now.

321
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:32,954
And also because

322
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:36,749
no other guy will love
and cherish you more than I do.

323
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,001
Do you

324
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:41,963
still love me?

325
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:44,382
Of course, I do.

326
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,176
- And?
- "And"?

327
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:49,303
What if I really decide to leave you?

328
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,222
I won't let you.

329
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:53,141
Why would I let go of someone I love?

330
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:54,809
But the saying goes,

331
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:57,770
"If you love someone, let them go."

332
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:00,273
You can do that.

333
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:01,858
What?

334
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:06,487
When a man says
something like that, he's lying.

335
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:09,991
A man may give up his life
for the woman he loves,

336
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:12,201
but he would never give up the woman.

337
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:17,206
I'm going to stick with you forever
and never let go.

338
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:18,791
That's so scary.

339
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:22,086
Come here.

340
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:25,298
Come on.

341
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:35,516
You're…

342
00:24:37,018 --> 00:24:38,477
the only one I love.

343
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:39,645
Me too.

344
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:42,190
You too, what?

345
00:24:43,024 --> 00:24:44,066
I love you.

346
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:48,905
<i>When he told me</i>

347
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:52,950
<i>that a man would give up his life</i>
<i>for a woman</i>

348
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:55,912
<i>but never give her up</i>

349
00:24:57,288 --> 00:24:59,582
<i>and that he'd stick with me forever,</i>

350
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:02,043
<i>I believed him.</i>

351
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:42,124
What are you looking at?

352
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:45,628
Fountain pens.

353
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:47,588
What for?

354
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:50,174
They say it's good to have one

355
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:52,468
when you become a writer.

356
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:53,928
Really?

357
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:58,766
Then I'll buy you one when that happens.

358
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:01,519
- Really?
- Sure.

359
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:03,437
- You mean it, right?
- Of course.

360
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:06,816
Do you like this one the most?

361
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,698
Can you inscribe "Author Lee Ji-su" here?

362
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:14,615
Sure thing.

363
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,118
<i>That night,</i>

364
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:20,663
<i>I secretly purchased the fountain pen</i>
<i>that Ji-su had been looking at…</i>

365
00:26:21,706 --> 00:26:24,166
Thank you. "Author Lee Ji-su."

366
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,378
<i>…because I believed</i>
<i>that Ji-su would achieve her dream.</i>

367
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:35,845
<i>Although I never got to give it to her.</i>

368
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:46,314
Auntie!

369
00:26:47,148 --> 00:26:49,692
What are you doing here, Hui-su?

370
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:53,195
The two of them were craving bread
at this time of night.

371
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,280
I'm sorry, honey.

372
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:56,115
Ji-su, you should join us.

373
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:57,742
It's okay. I'm going to write some more.

374
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:59,035
Come home before it gets too late.

375
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,036
- Take care.
- Bye.

376
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,078
Let's go.

377
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:05,833
<i>So he was Ji-su's older brother.</i>

378
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:10,004
<i>I suspected her</i>
<i>because of my inferiority complex.</i>

379
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:12,381
I'm an idiot.

380
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,594
Geon-u.

381
00:27:18,054 --> 00:27:19,347
Take good care of the place for me.

382
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:20,806
Sure.

383
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:31,150
I guess I'll have to keep the café open
for Ji-su's sake.

384
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:44,580
- Could I have--
- One hot citron tea, right?

385
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:47,041
That's right.

386
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:58,469
Here's your citron tea.

387
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:02,598
I didn't order the cake.

388
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:03,891
It's on the house.

389
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,684
I'm a fan of your book.

390
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,479
How did you know?

391
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:11,649
<i>TO YOU IN THE FUTURE</i>

392
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:13,609
I really enjoyed <i>To You in the Future,</i>

393
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,319
so I looked up who the author was.

394
00:28:15,403 --> 00:28:16,362
I see.

395
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,155
Thank you.

396
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:22,993
Actually,

397
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:26,247
I have an idea
I want to develop into a novel.

398
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:29,708
Is that so?

399
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:33,337
What is it about?

400
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:36,507
May I sit down?

401
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:39,385
Sure.

402
00:28:45,683 --> 00:28:46,517
So my story

403
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:50,146
is about a man
who experiences a series of deaths.

404
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,482
The man ends up dying.

405
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:57,403
- He goes to the afterlife…
<i>- I began to tell her</i>

406
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:59,530
<i>what I experienced after death</i>

407
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:01,282
<i>as if it were fictional,</i>

408
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:02,950
<i>skipping the part about Ji-su and I.</i>

409
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:04,243
…he gets reincarnated…

410
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:07,746
<i>About how I met Death after I died.</i>

411
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,874
Then, the main character…

412
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:10,791
Hold on.

413
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:13,002
What did you say your name was?

414
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:14,378
It's Choi…

415
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:19,300
It's Jang Geon-u.

416
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:20,468
Geon-u.

417
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:23,012
- That's right.
- You tell your story

418
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:26,515
so realistically,
as if you've experienced it yourself.

419
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:29,602
You describe
the protagonist's emotions in detail

420
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:31,145
as if they're your own.

421
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,399
Is that so?

422
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:38,360
<i>I guess that makes sense.</i>

423
00:29:38,736 --> 00:29:40,279
<i>I</i> did <i>experience it myself.</i>

424
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:42,198
But this character called "Death"

425
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:44,158
really is cruel.

426
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:45,159
Right?

427
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:47,745
Death is completely nuts.

428
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:49,747
How could it do such an awful thing to him

429
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,499
just because he mocked it?

430
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:53,918
And it keeps saying
that's just how death is.

431
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:55,794
It's complete nonsense!

432
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:03,677
- What's wrong?
- It's funny.

433
00:30:04,512 --> 00:30:06,263
It's a character you came up with,

434
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:08,849
but you're so immersed,
as if you've actually met it.

435
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:14,313
I must seem pretty weird to you.

436
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:16,857
No. I like it.

437
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:19,818
Do you have any more of this story?

438
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:21,320
Yes.

439
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:23,781
Tell me how it goes later.
I'd love to hear more.

440
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:25,991
Sure thing.

441
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:27,785
But wait.

442
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:31,038
What's the protagonist's name?

443
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:35,918
It's…

444
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:41,507
I still…

445
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:46,637
need to come up with a name.

446
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:49,306
I don't have one yet.

447
00:30:58,691 --> 00:30:59,692
I see.

448
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:04,989
Ms. Lee.

449
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:06,740
Could I get an autograph?

450
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:09,368
Sure.

451
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:21,088
That fountain pen…

452
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:23,173
What about it?

453
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:26,302
It's pretty.

454
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:29,680
It was a gift from someone.

00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:37,980
AUTHOR LEE JI-SU

00:31:46,614 --> 00:31:47,615
Ji-su.

458
00:31:51,035 --> 00:31:54,955
I think Yee-jae bought this
to give to you as a gift.

459
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:22,816
AUTHOR LEE JI-SU

460
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,935
<i>From that day onward,</i>

461
00:32:58,435 --> 00:33:01,397
<i>I kept talking to Ji-su</i>
<i>whenever she'd visit the café.</i>

462
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:05,150
<i>I kept telling her</i>
<i>about the deaths I experienced</i>

463
00:33:05,234 --> 00:33:08,070
<i>as if I were writing a novel</i>
<i>just for one person.</i>

464
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:12,032
But why did the protagonist of your story

465
00:33:12,116 --> 00:33:14,618
never once visit his mother?

466
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:18,580
I'd visit her every day if it were me.

467
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:20,457
It's because…

468
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:26,046
he doesn't think he could stand it.

469
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:28,882
He thinks it would be…

470
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:32,970
too painful to see her again.

471
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:38,976
What's wrong?

472
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:40,018
You said that

473
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:43,355
as if it were your own experience again.

474
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,482
Right.

475
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:47,735
I want to hear what happens next,

476
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:49,945
but it's gotten late already.

477
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:54,616
I'll get going, then.

478
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:29,943
Ji-su!

479
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:43,207
Geon-u.

480
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:45,793
It suddenly started raining.

481
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:47,252
Take this umbrella.

482
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,505
I'm fine.

483
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:50,714
You'll catch a cold.

484
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:55,385
Just take it.

485
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:58,514
Thank you.

486
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:00,098
We should…

487
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:05,437
do this again tomorrow.

488
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:07,815
Okay.

489
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:46,728
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

490
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:47,855
I'll take care of it.

491
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:11,795
How unfortunate.

492
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:13,714
I hope she didn't die in the accident.

493
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:17,009
I know. I think she came here often.

494
00:36:18,594 --> 00:36:19,636

<i>Just wait.</i>

497
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:31,899
The pain that death brings you

498
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:34,151
will only get worse from now on.

499
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:56,590
It can't be.

500
00:36:57,466 --> 00:36:58,592
You can't come any closer.

501
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:00,594
How is she doing? Did she survive?

502
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:02,304
- Step back.
- Tell me if she's okay!

503
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:03,847
- Is she alive or not?
- Please calm down.

504
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:05,891
- Move!
- Stop.

505
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:08,018
- Stay back!
- I asked you if she survived or not!

506
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:10,020
Let go of me! Come on!

507
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:11,521
Just let me go!

DEATHS 2, INJURIES 0

509

Are you all right?

510
00:37:55,357 --> 00:37:57,067
Yes. It wasn't a deep cut.

511
00:37:57,859 --> 00:37:58,944
Not your hand.

512
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:07,244
You came running over earlier.

513
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:09,454
I saw you.

514
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:14,793
I thought it was someone I knew.

515
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:16,503
It must be someone

516
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:20,716
who means a lot to you.

517
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:24,511
Yes.

518
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:26,805
You must have been startled.

519
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:35,230
It's fine.

520
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:37,107
I know what that feels like.

521
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:40,986
Watching you earlier…

522
00:38:43,697 --> 00:38:44,740
made me think…

523
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,494
that I might've looked like you did today…

524
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,081
on that day.

525
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:56,126

00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,469

527
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:07,637
Where's Choi Yee-jae?

528
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:09,681
Please tell me where he is.

529
00:39:10,891 --> 00:39:12,309
This can't be true!

530
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:14,269
How could this happen?

531
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:21,193
Yee-jae!

532
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:26,073
Yee-jae!

533
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:46,093
Do you feel

534
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:48,345
better now?

535
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:51,848
No, not yet.

536
00:39:58,772 --> 00:39:59,898
I should get going.

537
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:02,484
The wound may not be deep,

538
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,778
but you should see a doctor.

I can visit the café tomorrow.

544
00:40:29,803 --> 00:40:31,388
Did something come up?

545

Listening to all your stories…

546
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:39,855
reminded me of someone I know

547
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:42,023

00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:09,426
Are you doing all right?

550
00:41:13,013 --> 00:41:14,014
I, for one…

551
00:41:16,892 --> 00:41:18,185
have been doing just fine.

552
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:22,606
It's as if nothing's ever happened.

553
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:25,233
I sleep, eat,

554
00:41:27,444 --> 00:41:28,862
laugh, and talk.

555
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:33,575
But…

556
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:46,755
I miss you so much.

557
00:42:02,938 --> 00:42:04,231
If only I had…

558
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:08,360
kept you from leaving that night…

559
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:11,863
If I hadn't…

560
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:15,909
said those things…

561
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:21,998
would you have made a different choice?

562
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:32,217
I'm sorry.

563
00:42:39,641 --> 00:42:40,809
I'm sorry.

564
00:43:32,861 --> 00:43:33,987
Who are you?

565
00:43:54,883 --> 00:43:55,800
Mom.

566
00:43:56,926 --> 00:43:57,761
I'm sorry?

567
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:07,854
I'm here to see my mother.

568
00:44:11,733 --> 00:44:12,692
I see.

569
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:14,921
Yee-jae…

570
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:16,756
Yee-jae…

571
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:23,138
Yee-jae…

572
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:57,881
I'm sorry.

573
00:46:00,383 --> 00:46:01,426
I'm so sorry.

574
00:46:02,552 --> 00:46:04,554
I'm so sorry, Mom.

575
00:46:24,324 --> 00:46:26,659
<i>I wrote my mom a letter</i>

576
00:46:26,743 --> 00:46:28,703
<i>pretending to be an acquaintance of mine.</i>

577
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:33,666
<i>It said that Yee-jae made the money</i>
<i>through an investment in cryptocurrency,</i>

578
00:46:34,209 --> 00:46:36,085
<i>so she should spend it freely.</i>

579
00:48:12,473 --> 00:48:13,641
I've died so many times…

580
00:48:17,478 --> 00:48:19,147
that now I even die in my dreams.

581
00:48:25,528 --> 00:48:26,571
<i>That's fascinating.</i>

582
00:48:27,155 --> 00:48:28,656
Please tell me more next time.

583
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:31,284
Ji-su.

584
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:32,952
It's late.

585
00:48:33,036 --> 00:48:35,121
Would you mind if I walked you home?

586
00:48:35,204 --> 00:48:36,706
- It's fine.
- Wait.

587
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:38,625
I need to get going soon anyway.

588
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:41,919
Okay, then.

589
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:05,443
<i>The uneventful days</i>
<i>when we walked together hand in hand.</i>

590
00:49:06,361 --> 00:49:10,239
<i>Those moments alone</i>
<i>were more than enough reason to go on.</i>

591
00:49:10,907 --> 00:49:13,117
<i>Why hadn't I realized it sooner?</i>

592
00:49:14,494 --> 00:49:16,162
<i>The reason we're afraid of death</i>

593
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:18,706
<i>is because there will be no tomorrow.</i>

594
00:49:19,499 --> 00:49:22,210
<i>That's why I'm afraid</i>

595
00:49:23,044 --> 00:49:26,214
<i>that death might come knocking</i>
<i>at this very moment.</i>

596
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:30,176
Does that story of yours

597
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:33,304
have a happy ending?

598
00:49:35,098 --> 00:49:36,182
Do you think

599
00:49:37,433 --> 00:49:39,435
that a happy ending is possible?

600
00:49:42,522 --> 00:49:44,190
I sincerely hope…

601
00:49:46,818 --> 00:49:49,153
that your story ends happily.

602
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:51,906
Why?

603
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:56,536
Because I feel bad for the protagonist.

604
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,330
He had a difficult life

605
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:02,250
and didn't have anyone to rely on.

606
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:04,210
That's why he died.

607
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:08,256
But he needs to keep worrying
about his next death.

608
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:12,218
Even when he comes back to life
as someone else,

609
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,554
he constantly has to live in fear.

610
00:50:18,224 --> 00:50:19,767
You can't really say you're living…

611
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:23,563
when you live in constant fear.

612
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,818
"You're not really living

613
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:31,112
when you live in constant fear"?

614
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:34,824
People are happiest

615
00:50:35,992 --> 00:50:37,702
when they can truly be themselves.

616
00:50:38,828 --> 00:50:39,704
In the end,

617
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:42,373
life would be meaningless

618
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:46,127
if you can never really be yourself.

619
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:53,718
I'm sorry.

620
00:50:54,177 --> 00:50:55,720
I rambled on too much.

621
00:50:56,929 --> 00:50:59,056
Wait, Ji-su.

622
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:03,686
I have to tell you this today.

623
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:05,688
Because…

624
00:51:09,192 --> 00:51:11,694
today could be my last day alive.

625
00:51:12,612 --> 00:51:13,529
I'm sorry?

626
00:51:15,031 --> 00:51:17,158
Could you hear me out for a second?

627
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:20,578
Okay.

628
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:27,335
I used to have a girlfriend
whom I dated for seven years.

629
00:51:31,047 --> 00:51:32,965
While I was with her…

630
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:37,845
I was never able to show her my best self.

631
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:40,556
Take a seat.

632
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:43,351
Gosh, this place is nice.

633
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:45,186
Don't think about leaving.

634
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:47,271
We're going hard tonight.

635
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,274
I'm not going home tonight.

636
00:51:52,193 --> 00:51:53,152
Ms. Lee.

637
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:56,322
Have you ever considered Mr. Lee
as a potential boyfriend?

638
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:58,658
Sir, I already have a boyfriend.

639
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:00,660
Come on. You're lying.

640
00:52:01,327 --> 00:52:03,037
What do you think of Ms. Lee?

641
00:52:03,538 --> 00:52:05,915
Gosh, I'd love to date someone like her.

642
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:10,711
Then you'll be
our team's first-ever couple.

643
00:52:10,795 --> 00:52:11,629
Over here.

644
00:52:13,381 --> 00:52:15,341
Come on. That's nonsense.

645
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:18,803
Would you like to order?

646
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:20,805
You must care about men's looks.

647
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:23,099
Good looks won't put food on the table.

648
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:24,809
You'll end up starving to death.

649
00:52:24,892 --> 00:52:26,727
I really do have a boyfriend, Mr. Kim.

650
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:27,645
Where is he then?

651
00:52:30,773 --> 00:52:31,607
Right here.

652
00:52:31,691 --> 00:52:33,067
This is my boyfriend.

653
00:52:34,235 --> 00:52:35,653
What are you doing?

654
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:37,405
Say hello, Yee-jae.

655
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:38,656
These are my colleagues.

656
00:52:41,409 --> 00:52:42,243
Hello.

657
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:43,828
- Hello.
- Hello.

658
00:52:43,953 --> 00:52:46,080
See? He's handsome.

659
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:47,707
He also works very hard.

660
00:52:48,291 --> 00:52:49,959
He'll never let me starve to death.

661
00:52:57,717 --> 00:53:00,636
<i>Even during the times</i>
<i>I felt ashamed of myself,</i>

662
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:03,973
<i>she would confidently introduce me</i>
<i>as her boyfriend,</i>

663
00:53:04,432 --> 00:53:06,225
<i>no matter who she was with.</i>

664
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:10,688
She proudly told them
that I was the man she loved.

665
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:17,445
She was cynical
when it came to romance movies,

666
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:21,532
but she would call me in tears

667
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:24,827
when she saw starving children
in the ads on TV.

668
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:29,457
She preferred citron tea

669
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:31,834
over bitter coffee.

670
00:53:36,422 --> 00:53:37,381
She was someone

671
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:41,510
who made the most effort
when those around her felt down.

672
00:53:44,764 --> 00:53:46,265
That's why I foolishly thought…

673
00:53:49,018 --> 00:53:51,103
that she'd be doing just fine.

674
00:53:54,106 --> 00:53:55,733
I want to tell her…

675
00:54:00,947 --> 00:54:02,865
that I'm sorry for misunderstanding her.

676
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:06,285
And…

677
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:10,581
that she should stop being so sad
over someone like me.

678
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:12,249
And also

679
00:54:17,463 --> 00:54:19,048
that she's still the only one I love.

680
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:22,134
You're…

681
00:54:23,636 --> 00:54:24,887
the only one I love.

682
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:11,350
Why didn't I realize then…

683
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:16,147
that I had people in my life

684
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:19,483
who would cry with me
during difficult times?

685
00:55:23,654 --> 00:55:26,615
I know very well
that it's too late to ask for forgiveness.

686
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:27,783
I know that…

687
00:55:31,746 --> 00:55:33,414
because I'm already dead.

688
00:55:37,293 --> 00:55:38,627
What do you mean?

689
00:55:39,754 --> 00:55:42,631
The story I told you
about that man who had to keep dying…

690
00:55:42,715 --> 00:55:44,133
I didn't make that up.

691
00:55:44,467 --> 00:55:46,010
I know it sounds crazy,

692
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:49,346
but it's what I'm going through right now.

693
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:51,515
Just like the story I told you,

694
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:53,517
I've experienced seven deaths.

695
00:55:53,601 --> 00:55:55,853
Now I'm living as this man
who works as a model.

696
00:55:57,605 --> 00:55:59,523
The name I had before my first death…

697
00:56:02,902 --> 00:56:04,320
was Choi Yee-jae.

698
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:07,948
What are you saying?

699
00:56:08,741 --> 00:56:09,825
Ji-su.

700
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:11,368
I know it's hard to believe,

701
00:56:12,036 --> 00:56:13,621
but I really am Choi Yee-jae.

702
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:18,125
Choi Yee-jae?

703
00:56:20,169 --> 00:56:21,253
I…

704
00:56:59,959 --> 00:57:01,544
Ji-su…

705
00:57:05,798 --> 00:57:06,799
Ji…

706
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,290
Make his death look like an accident.

707
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,716
I'm so fucked.

708
00:58:35,638 --> 00:58:37,431
Sir. Are you all right?

709
00:58:38,265 --> 00:58:39,183
What should we do?

710
00:58:40,935 --> 00:58:41,894
That woman…

711
00:58:42,144 --> 00:58:43,979
Her neck's been completely twisted.

712
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:55,324
Her dead body…

713
00:59:00,955 --> 00:59:02,206
looks like a marionette.

714
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:23,978
So you're not dead yet.

715
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:38,659
I'll help you.

716
00:59:43,956 --> 00:59:44,915
You see,

717
00:59:46,709 --> 00:59:48,460
whether it's people or corporations,

718
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:53,632
I specialize in euthanasia.

719
01:00:33,422 --> 01:00:36,216
EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES

720
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:42,199
I'll kill that bastard.

721
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:47,287
But first…

722
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:04,388
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

723
01:02:06,181 --> 01:02:07,349
Try it for yourself.

724
01:02:45,804 --> 01:02:52,060
<i>Are you still standing there?</i>

725
01:02:52,603 --> 01:02:58,358
<i>Are you afraid to turn back?</i>

726
01:02:59,651 --> 01:03:05,532
<i>The face I somberly remembered</i>

727
01:03:06,158 --> 01:03:08,535
<i>The person I'm grateful for</i>

728
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:11,830
<i>The person I owe</i>

729
01:03:12,206 --> 01:03:18,921
<i>Although there's no miracle we hoped for</i>

730
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:26,178
<i>Nor the strength to get back on our feet</i>

731
01:03:26,261 --> 01:03:32,893
<i>Listen to the voice that embraces you</i>
