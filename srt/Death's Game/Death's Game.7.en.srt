1
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:25,568
Who are you?

2
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:34,076
You look like you've been wronged.

3
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,953
There's no point in explaining.

4
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,621
No one believes me anyway.

5
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:38,789
I do.

6
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,917
I know you're serving time
in Park Tae-u's place.

7
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:43,919
You do?

8
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,631
I saw it myself.

9
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:49,133
What?

10
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:51,927
Do you remember this?

11
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,098
It's the dashcam memory card
you threw in the gutter that night.

12
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:58,809
<i>So why don't you take the fall for this?</i>

13
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:01,145
Sir.

14
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:03,105
Here.

15
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:05,858
That's…

16
00:01:06,484 --> 00:01:09,320
This is the only thing
that can prove your innocence.

17
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:10,446
That's right.

18
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,452
I'm so relieved.

19
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:19,538
Thank you so much.

20
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:21,457
Here.

21
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,126
Thank you.

22
00:01:26,337 --> 00:01:27,171
What?

23
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:33,677
It's gone now.

24
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:40,059
What have you done?

25
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:43,604
Do you know what this means to me?

26
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,272
This was my lifeline!

27
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:48,150
For someone
who values his own life so much,

28
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:52,112
you don't seem to care much
about the lives of others.

29
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:54,615
How could you do this

30
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,326
when you're a detective?

31
00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,745
You should abide by the law!

32
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:01,288
"All this big talk about the law,

33
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,334
and you could end up dead."

34
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,420
- What?
- That was what you told me.

35
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:11,257
Right?

36
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:13,300
<i>All this big talk about the law,</i>

37
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:14,927
and you could end up dead.

38
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,557
But you look for the law
as soon as you're in hot water.

39
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:21,976
Just keep rotting away in prison.

40
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:24,645
And after your release,

41
00:02:25,688 --> 00:02:28,691
live out the rest of your life
as an ex-con with a murder record

42
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:31,735
and die

43
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,362
in utter misery.

44
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:39,535
Excuse me, Detective.

45
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:41,078
Wait!

46
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:42,621
Get back here, you bastard!

47
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:48,544
Get back here!

48
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:57,136
EPISODE 7
OPPORTUNITY

49
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:00,681
All the videos were confirmed to be true.

50
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:03,726
We've requested
an arrest warrant for Park Tae-u

51
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:06,020
for the charges of murder
and the concealment of corpses.

52
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:08,188
<i>High-ranking government officials</i>

53
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:10,774
<i>who aided in covering up</i>
<i>Park Tae-u's crimes have been arrested.</i>

54
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:13,444
Park Tae-u hasn't regained consciousness

55
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,529
after receiving another emergency surgery.

56
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:17,281
He is said to be in critical condition.

57
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:21,410
<i>Taekang's Chairman, Park Jin-seop,</i>
<i>has stepped down from his position,</i>

58
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:25,080
<i>leaving Taekang in the hands</i>
<i>of professional managers.</i>

59
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:28,417
<i>While Park Tae-u's condition</i>
<i>post-surgery is still unknown,</i>

60
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,753
<i>the police announced</i>
<i>that they will question him</i>

61
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:34,715
<i>about the driver who was stabbed to death</i>
<i>a month ago by a fountain pen</i>

62
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:38,218
<i>as soon as he regains consciousness.</i>

63
00:04:04,787 --> 00:04:06,330
God kept you alive…

64
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,876
so you could experience hell on earth.

65
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:26,141
You'll live the rest of your life
in a half-vegetative state.

66
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:40,280
Killing, your favorite pastime,
is beyond you now.

67
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,200
You won't even be able to hurt a fly.

68
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:48,747
It was fun talking to you.

69
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:49,957
I'll get going.

70
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:51,750
Don't see me out.

71
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:36,086
THE LATE LEE JI-SU

72
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,298
You…

73
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,136
held me back that night, didn't you?

74
00:05:49,475 --> 00:05:50,476
Ji-su…

75
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:41,110
AUTHOR LEE JI-SU

76
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,239
<i>I kept running</i>

77
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:48,075
<i>until I ran out of breath</i>
<i>to get my revenge.</i>

78
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:51,203
<i>All that was left for me</i>

79
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,705
<i>was the fact</i>

80
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,999
<i>that I had to die again.</i>

81
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:07,010
I've got it!

82
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:18,772
Gil-su.

83
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,358
You've gained a lot of weight.

84
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,818
You bastard!

85
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:23,986
Damn it.

86
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:28,240
Those bastards.

87
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,662
Let me go, you bastard.

88
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:36,290
<i>I carried on living as An Ji-hyeong,</i>

89
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:39,042
<i>waiting for Death</i>
<i>to come knocking at any minute.</i>

90
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,921
<i>I started to get used to</i>
<i>living as An Ji-hyeong,</i>

91
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:46,008
<i>as if I had been him all along.</i>

92
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,509
- Great job, sir.
- You too.

93
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,281
Any last words?

94
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:17,414
I guess not.

95
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:29,885
What about you?

96
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,678
Any last words?

97
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,691
Are you all right?

98
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:06,338
How are you doing?

99
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,258
It's just a scratch.

100
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:11,551
Thank you for saving me.

101
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:13,220
Don't mention it. It was nothing.

102
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,013
Gosh.

103
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:17,683
They'll worry when they see me here.

104
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:18,767
Who will?

105
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,103
- Dad!
- Honey!

106
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,858
Does it hurt a lot, Dad?

107
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:28,360
Honey.

108
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:29,945
There you go again.

109
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:31,154
Stop crying.

110
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,572
Not while Seul-gi is here.

111
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:33,824
Mom.

112
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,118
Don't cry.

113
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:37,286
Honey.

114
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:42,416
Seul-gi.

115
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,710
Want to go get some snacks?

116
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,254
Who are you, mister?

117
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:48,422
Seul-gi.

118
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,341
He's my friend from work.

119
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:53,093
You can call him Uncle.

120
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:55,721
Uncle?

121
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:57,180
Yes. Uncle.

122
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:08,984
Why aren't you eating?

123
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,987
- Uncle.
- Yes?

124
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,324
You're a police officer too.

125
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:17,576
Do you also get hurt

126
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,369
every time you work?

127
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,958
Whenever my dad goes to work,

128
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:27,210
he always comes home hurt.

129
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,591
To be honest,

130
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:35,594
I worry about him
every time he goes to work.

131
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:39,723
I wish my dad would stop getting hurt.

132
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:43,727
Seul-gi.

133
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:46,855
I'll do my best

134
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:49,733
to make sure he doesn't get hurt
while working.

135
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:51,109
Really?

136
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:52,527
Yes.

137
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:54,071
Pinky promise.

138
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,075
There.

139
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:15,675
You should stop getting hurt as well.

140
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,026
Thank you, Seul-gi.

141
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,198
- Are you curious?
- Yes.

142
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,033
Do you like what I got you?

143
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:46,581
Mom! Dad!

144
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,375
- You're back.
- Goodness.

145
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,545
Are you all right now, Dad?

146
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:52,671
I'm fine now.

147
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,423
Let's visit a theme park
when Dad gets out.

148
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:55,924
- I'd love that!
- Goodness.

149
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:00,929
<i>If I hadn't died,</i>

150
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:05,225
<i>would I have been able to</i>
<i>start a family of my own?</i>

151
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,505
Fucking hell!

152
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:37,507
Why would you come all the way up here?

153
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:41,303
Where else did you think it would lead?

154
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,931
We know you have drugs,
so turn yourself in.

155
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,435
Drugs aren't the only thing I have.

156
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,355
Die, you pigs!

157
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,908
That's what you get
for chasing me here, you bastards!

158
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,786
Who wants to go first?

159
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,206
Damn it.

160
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:16,129
You should stop getting hurt as well.

161
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:23,553
<i>I wish my dad would stop getting hurt.</i>

162
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:25,514
- You're back.
- Goodness.

163
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:32,145
I might have failed to save Ji-su…

164
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,024
but not this time.

165
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:40,987
I'll make sure that doesn't happen.

166
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:42,030
Put your hands up!

167
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:53,041
Let me go!

168
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:57,045
Can people stop shooting me for once?

169
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:00,966
Ji-hyeong!

170
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:17,023
Ji-hyeong!

171
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,645
I thought I warned you.

172
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:57,772
Right.

173
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,191
Are you upset that I killed myself?

174
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,069
I had a good reason to.

175
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:04,029
Reason?

176
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:06,656
It was to save Detective Woo Ji-hun.

177
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:10,368
I did it to save someone else's life.

178
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:11,703
And?

179
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:14,247
What do you mean?

180
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:21,421
I sacrificed myself
to save someone else's life.

181
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,634
- You?
- That's right.

182
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,429
And who are you, exactly?

183
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:31,848
What?

184
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,141
I asked who you were.

185
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:35,894
What kind of a question is that?

186
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:48,114
You seem to be very proud of yourself.

187
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,076
Why don't you leave for now?

188
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:00,043
What?

189
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:02,337
Why am I so disheveled?

190
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,091
Gosh, I stink.

191
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:08,927
Am I a homeless man?

192
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:15,100
Knowing my next form
must've been why Death was laughing.

193
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:22,607
I've been through so much until now.

194
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:24,234
This is nothing.

195
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,624
<i>Do you remember Detective An Ji-hyeong,</i>

196
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,710
<i>the man who shed light on</i>
<i>the brutal crimes</i>

197
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:44,379
<i>of Taekang's ex-CEO, Park Tae-u,</i>

198
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:46,506

199
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,299
<i>bringing them to justice?</i>

200
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,426
Hey.

201
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,430
<i>We have sad news that Detective An</i>
<i>died while he was out on duty.</i>

202

<i>is currently being held</i>

203
00:16:56,975 --> 00:17:00,019
<i>- at Taekang Hospital's funeral hall.</i>
- Gosh, he died.

204
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,647
People like him
deserve to live long lives.

205
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:04,023
I know.

206
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:06,443
<i>The chief of Seoul Metropolitan Police</i>

207
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,153
<i>visited the funeral home this afternoon,</i>

208
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:09,821
- I should pay a visit…
<i>- awarding him a medal</i>

209
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,114
<i>and a certificate of merit.</i>

210
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,324
- to my own funeral.
<i>- He was also promoted posthumously.</i>

211
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:15,243
<i>Detective An will be buried</i>

212
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,620
<i>in the police section</i>
<i>of the Seoul National Cemetery.</i>

213
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:20,123
<i>With the passing</i>
<i>of Detective An Ji-hyeong,</i>

214
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,709
<i>who showed us</i>
<i>that justice always prevails,</i>

215
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:26,546
<i>various groups are continuing</i>
<i>to share memories of the late detective</i>

216
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:28,214
<i>and express their condolences.</i>

217
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,217
<i>After it was revealed</i>
<i>that Detective An's father</i>

218
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:34,345
<i>was also a policeman</i>
<i>who died on duty many years ago</i>

219
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:36,639
<i>while chasing a violent offender,</i>

220
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:38,558
<i>many have expressed their deep respect</i>

221
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:41,853
<i>for the service</i>
<i>of both the father and the son.</i>

222
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:44,272
TAEKANG HOSPITAL FUNERAL HALL

223
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:01,289
Wow, from an assemblyman?

224
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:04,042
That's impressive.

225
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:07,712
What?

226
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:09,672
"Actor Song Ji-seop"?

227
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:13,051
Man, I'm a huge fan of his.

228
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:30,860
Uncle.

229
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:35,740
Are you really watching over us
from above?

230
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:39,035
Thank you, Uncle.

231
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,581
You kept the promise you made me.

232
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,544
I miss you, Uncle.

233
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:00,223
Hey, wait…

234
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:15,738
Mom.

235
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:21,870
Let's go.

236
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:24,789
I just…

237
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:32,630
He should've stuck to his old ways.

238
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:34,591
Acting out of character
brought on early death.

239
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,803
These past few months,
it was as if he was a different person.

240
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:42,348
They say people suddenly change
when it's their time to go.

241
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:45,852
Sir.

242
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,439
Are you here for a free meal?

243
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,733
What? No.

244
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,860
- Then leave.
- What?

245
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:56,029
- I said leave.
- I was just…

246
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,739
I told you to get out!

247
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:59,449
- Come on.
- Excuse me.

248
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:01,743
Let him be.

249
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:05,496
We should be grateful that one more person
wants to pay their condolences.

250
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:07,373
Hold on.

251
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:14,464
Here.

252
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:16,341
Take this.

253
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:22,639
Enjoy.

254
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:25,183
Let's go for a smoke.

255
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,564
Hurry and get going.

256
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,501
The prime minister is here!

257
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:02,762
What did you think of the late detective?

258
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:11,604
THE LATE AN JI-HYEONG, AGE 42

259
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:13,314
<i>Due to my actions,</i>

260
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:16,609
<i>many people ended up</i>
<i>cherishing his memory.</i>

261
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:20,738
<i>But the deeds I accomplished</i>
<i>as An Ji-hyeong</i>

262
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:26,160
<i>had nothing to do with me in the end.</i>

263
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:36,796
WE WILL NEVER FORGET
THE PRECIOUS MEMORIES WE SHARED TOGETHER

264
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:50,643
I won't ask you to sacrifice yourself
for your partner.

265
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:53,396
But at the very least,
let's not embarrass ourselves.

266
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,189
Come on!

267
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,029
It's all my fault.

268
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,785
I'm sorry, Ji-hyeong.

269
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:21,883
It's not your fault.

270
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:27,138
So you should stop blaming yourself.

271
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:34,312
I'm sure Detective An

272
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:37,607
wouldn't feel that way.

273
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:41,569
And I'm sure he feels glad

274
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:44,739
that he was the one…

275
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:49,410
to jump in that day.

276
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,247
Who the hell are you?

277
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:56,918
What gives you the right
to say such things?

278
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,254
- What?
- Who do you think you are?

279
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:04,550
I…

280
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:06,803
<i>And who are you, exactly?</i>

281
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,263
I asked who you were.

282
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:30,201
I'm…

283
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:52,807
I don't know

284
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:56,185
who I am anymore.

285
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:01,232
What?

286
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:23,004
<i>People are happiest</i>

287
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:25,339
when they can truly be themselves.

288
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,091
In the end,

289
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:30,011
life would be meaningless

290
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:33,055
if you can never really be yourself.

291
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,018
Ji-su…

292
00:24:38,895 --> 00:24:40,771
<i>I finally came to understand</i>

293
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:43,983
<i>that being reborn time and again</i>
<i>as different people</i>

294
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:46,277
<i>was all pointless</i>

295
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:48,529
<i>if I could no longer live</i>

296
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,823
<i>as my true self.</i>

297
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,208
Can't we stop now?

298
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,585
I don't need any of this anymore.

299
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:55,930
You must've had fun
watching me being proud of deeds

300
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:57,723
that weren't even mine.

301
00:25:57,807 --> 00:26:00,810
Seeing how much more of a fool
you could make out of yourself

302
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,395
was rather entertaining.

303
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:07,775
Did I even save Detective Woo Ji-hun?

304
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:11,487
Was he actually destined to die there?

305
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,114
I'm sure you now know…

306
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:16,909
that none of that matters.

307
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:21,372
Hurry up and shoot.

308
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:24,709
I just need to die two more times
for this to end.

309
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:27,295
Do you remember how I said
the pain of death would get worse

310
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:29,005
with each round?

311
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,965
What lies waiting for you at the end

312
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:34,093
is pain beyond your wildest imagination.

313
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:35,678
Whatever that is,

314
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:38,055
I can just kill myself
and be done with it.

315
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:42,685
You fool.

316
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:02,538
<i>Who's this supposed to be?</i>

317
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:07,626
<i>Who cares?</i>

318
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,631
<i>Let's just get it over with.</i>

319
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:36,405
<i>This man was living the life</i>

320
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:39,450
<i>that I wanted so badly before I died.</i>

321
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:42,036
<i>He was employed,</i>

322
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:44,330
<i>married,</i>

323
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:46,874
<i>and had a family of his own.</i>

324
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:51,587
<i>He was living an ordinary life</i>
<i>that seemed so far from my reach.</i>

325
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:56,384
<i>But it all ended so easily…</i>

326
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:57,301
TERMINATION NOTICE

327
00:27:57,385 --> 00:27:58,427
<i>…and in vain.</i>

<i>…ended up abandoning him completely.</i>

333

<i>They were saying,</i>
<i>"You are no longer useful to us."</i>

334
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:40,553
<i>The empty void left in his heart</i>

335
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:43,514
<i>was desperately</i>

336
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:46,225
<i>wishing for death.</i>

337
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:50,312
<i>Just like…</i>

338
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:57,194
<i>how I had felt then.</i>

339
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:05,953
<i>Once again…</i>

340
00:29:07,872 --> 00:29:10,082
<i>I had to make a choice.</i>

341
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:14,503
Thanks, Ji-su.

342
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:16,797
I'll call you after the interview is over.

343
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:18,632
<i>Okay. You can do it!</i>

344
00:29:18,716 --> 00:29:19,633
Thanks.

345
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:32,813
I need to get a job before I graduate.

346
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:34,148
I can do this.

347
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:35,274
No.

348
00:29:37,151 --> 00:29:38,235
I have to do this.

349
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,473
Sir, are you all right?

350
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:08,724
Sir!

351
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:11,393
Are you all right?

352
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:13,646
Sir. Are you okay?

353
00:30:19,235 --> 00:30:20,236
What do I do?

354
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:24,657
Is this 911?

355
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,116
Someone's been hit by a car.

356
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:30,079
I'm at the intersection outside Taekang.

357
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:22,047
Help me.

358
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:27,886
Please help me.

359
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:32,224
Please.

360
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:42,776
<i>He looked up at me as if I were a god.</i>

361
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:46,488
He was begging me with his eyes.

362
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,365
To this very day…

363
00:31:51,035 --> 00:31:52,953
I remember how electrifying it was.

364
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:17,061
Sir…

365
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:52,513
Someone should call 911.

366
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:53,722
My goodness.

367
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:26,338
You truly are a lost cause.

368
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,593
Wasn't the thing you wanted most

369
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:34,346
a chance to turn everything back?

370
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:36,181
What makes you so sure?

371
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:38,559
Because all the humans I've punished

372
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:41,854
ended up wanting the same thing.

373
00:33:45,566 --> 00:33:47,484
Humans don't recognize an opportunity

374
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:49,820
even when it's handed to them.

375
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:52,781
Didn't you claim you could beat me

376
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:56,285
playing by the rules I have created?

377
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:00,831
We're down to the final shot.

378
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:14,636
Death is merely
a means of ending the pain I'm in.

379
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:28,609
If I'm ending up in hell anyway,
let's not waste time.

380
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:32,654
I'll end it quickly,
no matter whose body you put me in.

381
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:37,785
I doubt you will.

382
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:39,536
We'll have to see about that.

383
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:09,441
<i>What?</i>

384
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:39,388
Mom?

385
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:21,305
<i>Are you still standing there?</i>

386
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:27,436
<i>Are you afraid to turn back?</i>

387
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:34,902
<i>The face I somberly remembered</i>

388
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:37,404
<i>The person I'm grateful for</i>

389
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:40,699
<i>The person I owe</i>

390
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:48,165
<i>Although there's no miracle we hoped for</i>

391
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:55,297
<i>Nor the strength to get back on our feet</i>

392
00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:02,304
<i>Listen to the voice that embraces you</i>

393
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:09,311
<i>"I love you"</i>

394
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:14,983
<i>"I love you"</i>

395
00:37:35,212 --> 00:37:41,677
<i>If you're still hesitating</i>

396
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,222
<i>I hope you find the courage</i>

397
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:50,143
<i>To stand up again</i>

398
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:56,817
<i>And overcome it</i>

399
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:10,247
