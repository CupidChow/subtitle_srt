1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:04,672
Since we've hit our goal,

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,925
I'll soon proceed
with the mission as pledged.

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,260
WHAT'S UP FOR TODAY?

4
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:10,553
FINALLY!

5
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:13,305
I'll beat up Yu Gil-hak the murderer
live on this stream.

6
00:00:13,389 --> 00:00:14,724
IS THAT REALLY YU GIL-HAK?

7
00:00:14,807 --> 00:00:16,016
HE'S COMPLETELY NUTS

8
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,393
I'M SURE THIS IS FAKE

9
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:18,894
WHAT A LIAR

10
00:00:18,978 --> 00:00:20,146
Come on, everyone.

11
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:23,023
Have I ever lied to you on a stream?

12
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,152
Be prepared to make donations.

13
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:27,403
I'll see you soon.

14
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:31,365
Have those idiots
been lied to all their lives?

15
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:33,617
- Hey, get a thumbnail for the video ready.
- Okay.

16
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:38,581
You're dead.

17
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:45,296
Who the hell are you bastards?

18
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:49,258
Did that scare you?

19
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,594
How scared do you think your victims were

20
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:54,054
as you sexually assaulted
and murdered them?

21
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:15,951
Hey!

22
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,995
Let's get this stream started.

23
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,217
Who the hell are you?

24
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,891
Do you want to die?

25
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:50,277
Do I want to die?

26
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:56,158
Do you even have the guts to kill me?

27
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,588
Who are you?

28
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:11,382
Me?

29
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:16,679
Someone who isn't a nobody like you.

30
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:34,530
Thank you.

31
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,825
But may I ask

32
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:41,328
what you were doing there?

33
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,664
I was looking for materials
for my next piece.

34
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,502
So you're a painter.

35
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:49,712
I am.

36
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:53,257
By any chance,

37
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:56,385
do you know who I am?

38
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:01,599
Yes, I do.

39
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,519
Then why?

40
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:07,771
Why did you save me?

41
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,901
I don't like my materials

42
00:03:12,735 --> 00:03:14,236
getting damaged.

43
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,698
What?

44
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,162
We're here.

45
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:24,538
That's my house over there.

46
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,750
No, it isn't.

47
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:30,711
Mister.

48
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,132
Why would you lie?

49
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,509
What?

50
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:40,554
Who the hell are you?

51
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:27,476
What's this?

52
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,978
Hey!

53
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,951
Are you up?

54
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:46,453
What's going on?

55
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,124
Are you trying to get back at me
for something I did?

56
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,543
You seem to be mistaken,

57
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,546
but I just kill people.

58
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:00,676
I'm killing you because that's what I do.

59
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,972
Who you are has nothing to do with this.

60
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:09,309
Do you get it?

61
00:05:10,436 --> 00:05:11,437
What?

62
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:18,694
Please spare me.

63
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:21,864
Please don't.

64
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:24,575
Don't!

65
00:05:58,442 --> 00:05:59,443
EPISODE 5

66
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:03,197
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BREAK FREE
AND FIGHT AGAINST DEATH.

67
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:17,002
I'll kill that bastard.

68
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,174
But first…

69
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,023
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

70
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,235
Try it for yourself.

71
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,690
What's going on?

72
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:20,607
It's not working.

73
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:22,192
Is there a problem?

74
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,086
What happened?

75
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:44,673
Did you die and come back here?

76
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:47,009
A simpleton like you
always ruins everything

77
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:48,427
by overthinking it.

78
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,683
Fire does not get burned.

79
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:57,936
Water does not get wet.

80
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,023
It's blatantly obvious, isn't it?

81
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,525
Well then,

82
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,029
why don't you complete
this next sentence for me?

83
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,238
Death…

84
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:10,449
Does not die.

85
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:20,000
You planned all of this, didn't you?

86
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,378
- What do you mean?
- All the deaths related to Park Tae-u.

87
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:25,923
And…

88
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:28,759
Ji-su's death.

89
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,679
I saw you reading her book.

90
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:35,933
Why did you have her die as well?

91
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:39,728
This is just too cruel,
even if you're a god!

92
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:44,316
Did you just laugh?

93
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,859
I told you this before,

94
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:48,528
but I'm not a god.

95
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:51,865
I've simply taken on this form
to communicate with humans.

96
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,785
I can change myself into anything I want.

97
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,088
Do you like what you see?

98
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:07,798
Is that your true form?

99
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:09,508
No.

100
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:25,148
Yee-jae.

101
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,281
Ji-su.

102
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,293
Stop it.

103
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:52,092
You were just glaring and yelling at me.

104
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,094
Why turn away now?

105
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,722
Please stop.

106
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:57,806
What's wrong?

107
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:00,559
Do you feel guilty for this woman's death?

108
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:09,192
All I did was read the writing
of a woman doomed to die soon.

109
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,779
I checked to see
whether she deserved to be punished,

110
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,864
just like you.

111
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:15,490
Then,

112
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:18,327
am I to blame for Ji-su's--

113
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,371
She was destined to die there
at that hour.

114
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:25,625
She just ended up getting to know
the person she was to die with.

115
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:27,461
That's all that changed.

116
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,548
Are you saying that Ji-su was destined
to be killed by Park Tae-u?

117
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,428
Why would he, though?

118
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:44,770
Now,

119
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,855
shall we start
the second half of our game?

120
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:49,649
Sure.

121
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:51,485
That's what I wanted.

122
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,945
- Do you still wish for a quick death?
- No.

123
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,782
I can't wait to kill that son of a bitch.

124
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,033
Didn't I tell you

125
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,118
that I would intervene

126
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,871
if you tried to take someone's life?

127
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:05,707
Sure. I'd love to see you try.

128
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,001
Do you think you can break my rules

129
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,462
and beat me at my own game?

130
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:13,840
Humans sometimes
have to fight the losing battle.

131
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:17,094
Humans never listen,
no matter how much you warn them.

132
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,262
What a bunch of idiots.

133
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,313
I can't waste a precious bullet.

134
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:30,690
All of this is suffering
that you must experience.

135
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,927
<i>What's all this blood?</i>

136
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,430
<i>Am I bleeding right now?</i>

137
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,852
<i>Who is this man supposed to be?</i>

138
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,954
Is someone there?

139
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,155
Jeez. That startled me.

140
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:31,520
What's this guy's deal?

141
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:03,093
No way.

142
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,763
Is all of this blood?

143
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:18,608
That's disgusting.

144
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,822
<i>My name is Jeong Gyu-cheol.</i>

145
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:25,657
<i>I'm 34 years old.</i>

146
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:31,371
<i>I was born into an ordinary family,</i>

147
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:34,916
<i>but I realized at an early age</i>
<i>that I was born with a special gift.</i>

148
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:40,380
YOUNG ARTISTS AWARDS CEREMONY

149
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:45,969
GRAND PRIZE

150
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,054
<i>But the world</i>

151
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,557
<i>failed to recognize my gift.</i>

152
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,686
<i>Then one day,</i>

153
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:40,315
<i>I happened to come across</i>
<i>an electrifying sight</i>

154
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,860
<i>that filled me with inspiration.</i>

155
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,787
<i>I painted what I saw that day,</i>

156
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:58,375
<i>and it ended up</i>
<i>selling at a high price overseas</i>

157
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,837
<i>with critical acclaim,</i>
<i>saying that it captured human depravity.</i>

158
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,632
<i>After that,</i>

159
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,634
<i>I became serious about my art.</i>

160
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:35,161
Severed body parts were found
in Sangwon Lake Park.

161
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:37,664
<i>The prints taken from</i>
<i>the limbs that were recovered</i>

162
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:40,250
revealed that the victim
was reported missing a week ago…

163
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,669
Seven dismembered bodies were found

164
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,587
on a hill in Pyeongjae-dong.

165
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:46,548
<i>The police found that the mutilations…</i>

166
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,383
These are Mr. Jeong Gyu-cheol's paintings.

167
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:49,759
The starting bid is 120 million…

168
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,136
130 million. 140 million.

169
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:55,682
<i>This case is also presumed to be linked</i>
<i>to the serial killer at large.</i>

170
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:58,810
We'll now begin the bidding
for the second painting, <i>Scratch.</i>

171
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:00,145
120 million. 170 million.

172
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,365
<i>The fifteen people</i>
<i>who gave their lives to inspire me…</i>

173
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,997
<i>were born again</i>
<i>as the works of art I created.</i>

174
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:52,864
You demonic sicko.

175
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:07,921
<i>"Author Lee Ji-su"?</i>

176
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,423
Her dead body…

177
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,595
looks like a marionette.

178
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:40,370
I'll use this demon…

179
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,207
to kill another demon.

180
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:50,797
Park Tae-u…

181
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:57,470
I'll make sure you die
the most painful death there is.

182
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,027
Nice.

183
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:16,281
Your shooting skills are unparalleled.

184
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,159
One moment, please.

185
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:53,526
Let's go a bit more classic.

186
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,694
You got it, sir.

187
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:06,205
Go!

188
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,111
Just like the story I told you,

189
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:38,988
I've experienced seven deaths.

190
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:41,366
Now I'm living as this man
who works as a model.

191
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,826
The name I had before my first death

192
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:45,620
was Choi Yee-jae.

193
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:47,872
Ji-su.

194
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:50,333
I know it's hard to believe,

195
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,834
but I really am Choi Yee-jae.

196
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:48,016
AUTHOR LEE JI-SU

197
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:52,603
Father will remove me from my position
if he finds out, right?

198
00:21:53,271 --> 00:21:54,605
That can't happen.

199
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,734
So why don't you take the fall for this?

200
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,236
- I'm sorry?
- You haven't been drinking.

201
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:03,406
But neither have you.

202
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:05,533
I did drugs, though.

203
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,244
What?

204
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,080
If you do end up in prison,

205
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,959
I'll make it up to you
by paying you for the time you served.

206
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:20,173
I'll even make you the CEO
of one of our subsidiaries.

207
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:35,438
Sir.

208
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:37,607
Here.

209
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,203
I'll go turn myself in.

210
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:55,416
Is this 911?

211
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:57,919
I got into an accident.

212
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:07,220
"Author Lee Ji-su"?

213
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:11,641
Her dead body

214
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:13,935
looks like a marionette.

215
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:53,391
Yes, sir.

216
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:59,021
Mr. Park is out of the office right now
on personal business.

217
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:03,943
Then, when will he be back?

218
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:06,779
I'm afraid I can't share
his personal schedule.

219
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:10,575
Which station did you say
you were a reporter for?

220
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,829
I'll come back another time.

221
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:27,466
Sir.

222
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:33,389
There will be a seminar
for our employees today.

223
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,683
Make sure to be there
to get their spirits up.

224
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,435
Yes, sir. I'll be sure to do that.

225
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:56,495
Why don't you hop in?

226
00:24:57,622 --> 00:24:59,624
It's fine. We'll take the next one.

227
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:01,459
Please, I insist.

228
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:03,377
We're all family, aren't we?

229
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:05,296
Thank you, sir.

230
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:06,797
Excuse me.

231
00:25:13,638 --> 00:25:14,722
<i>Psychopaths.</i>

232
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:17,183
There might be one among us right now.

233
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:20,019
An analysis of roughly
1 000 successful American CEOs

234
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:24,523
revealed that 21% of them
showed psychopathic traits.

235
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:27,985
The study concludes that psychopaths

236
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:30,238
are more likely to end up successful.

237
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:33,115
If they don't have
an impulse to kill, that is.

238
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:39,372
They are able to succeed because
they push forward to fulfill their desires

239
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:41,791
without any empathy.

240
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:44,669
Stephen Lee, the CEO of Kane,
Taekang's rival company,

241
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:46,212
is said to be a psychopath as well.

242
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,630
We can't let them win, can we?

243
00:25:47,964 --> 00:25:50,800
How about we invite
Mr. Park onto the stage for a test?

244
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:57,098
You're good-looking enough
to be a celebrity.

245
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:58,849
And since you're a man who has it all,

246
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:01,018
let's see if you also have
the traits of a psychopath.

247
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:09,944
How many smiling faces
do you see here, Mr. Park?

248
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,878
There are three.

249
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:30,840
You seem to have had
trouble with that one.

250
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,758
We'll move on to the next slide.

251
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:37,054
Which of these photos
is different from the others?

252
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:38,848
It's the third one.

253
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,892
I'm sorry to tell you this,

254
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:43,728
but Mr. Park doesn't seem
to be a psychopath.

255
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:44,937
That's a shame.

256
00:26:54,322 --> 00:26:58,534
CEO PARK TAE-U, THE RISING
NEW NOBILITY OF THE 21ST CENTURY

257
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:30,691
You have a brain tumor.

258
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:32,902
To tell you the truth,

259
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:35,488
it's too late for treatment.

260
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:40,701
<i>Then, that blood must have been…</i>

261
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,756
Mr. Jeong. I know it's hard to accept…

262
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:57,009
How much time do I have left?

263
00:27:57,093 --> 00:27:59,553
I'd say a month at most.

264
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:02,014
- That's more than enough.
- I'm sorry?

265
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:05,518
Mr. Jeong.

266
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:08,145
Mr. Jeong!

267
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:16,779
<i>I should figure out</i>
<i>where Park Tae-u lives first.</i>

268
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:24,912
Yes?

269
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:25,955
<i>Mr. Jeong.</i>

270
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:28,541
Someone contacted us saying that
they wanted to buy <i>Red Cloud</i>.

271
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:32,545
I told them that
the piece wasn't up for sale,

272
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:35,339
but they kept insisting
on talking to you in person.

273
00:28:35,423 --> 00:28:38,217
What sort of lunatic
would want to buy crap like that?

274
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:39,510
<i>I'm sorry?</i>

275
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:42,096
It was CEO Park Tae-u of Taekang.

276
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:46,016
Park Tae-u?

277
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,103
<i>Yes. He said that he was</i>
<i>on his way to the gallery right now.</i>

278
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:51,397
I'll be right there.

279
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:16,797
I hear this piece is to your liking.

280
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:19,967
And you are?

281
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:24,054
I'm Jeong Gyu-cheol.

282
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:27,057
Right. Mr. Jeong.

283
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,727
It's an honor to finally meet you.

284
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:43,574
If it isn't too much trouble,

285
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:45,993
could you share
your interpretation of this work?

286
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:52,249
This piece

287
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:56,378
was created by connecting
the blood of five people.

288
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:58,255
Do you mean…

289
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:00,257
real blood?

290
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:01,550
That's right.

291
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:03,010
These lines

292
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:06,889
depict how their deaths
were all connected by the hand of a god.

293
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:09,350
The "god" you're referring to…

294
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:13,312
must be yourself.

295
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:16,649
That's right.

296
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:21,779
I knew that you'd understand my work.

297
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:31,288
Why do you think it is
that I'm so drawn to your work?

298
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:33,707
It must be because we're alike.

299
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:37,836
Like tends to attract like.

300
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:41,298
And what kind of people are we?

301
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:47,221
Lunatics who consider themselves gods.

302
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:48,556
What was that?

303
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,939
I kill people,

304
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:58,983
just like you.

305
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:09,493
I'm just kidding.

306
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,746
I didn't expect you to get so serious.

307
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:20,671
That joke was quite uncalled for,

308
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:23,090
especially from a stranger.

309
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:28,679
I apologize if I offended you.

310
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:55,664
If you ever try to kill someone,

311
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:59,209
I will intervene.

312
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:06,717
Mr. Park.

313
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:12,848
The chairman is looking for you.

314
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:19,146
I was told that you were
never going to sell this piece.

315
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:22,566
That's unfortunate.

316
00:32:23,067 --> 00:32:23,984
Goodbye.

317
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:31,575
Mr. Park.

318
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:37,498
If I were to sell you this piece,

319
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,583
where would you put it?

320
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:40,918
My home.

321
00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:44,880
Your home…

322
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,759
That would give this painting value.

323
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:49,968
I'll sell it.

324
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:51,595
If you give me your address,

325
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,138
I'll deliver it to you myself.

326
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:55,349
If you would,

327
00:32:57,643 --> 00:32:58,936
I'd be very grateful.

328
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:00,020
After that,

329
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:02,898
I would like to
invite you over to my studio.

330
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,693
There, I'll paint a special piece

331
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:08,195
just for you.

332
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:10,322
I'll be looking forward to it, then.

333
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:19,915
That's right.

334
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:21,625
Look forward to it.

335
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:25,379
I'll make you die a painful death.

336
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:36,557
<i>Death said it'd intervene</i>
<i>if I tried to kill anyone.</i>

337
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:39,935
<i>Does that mean</i>
<i>that it's keeping an eye on me?</i>

338
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:45,274
I pray in the name of Our Lord,
Jesus Christ.

339
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:46,442
Amen.

340
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:49,903
Before we end the mass,

341
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:53,699
the father of the late Park Jin-tae John,
the former CEO of Taekang,

342
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:57,578
Mr. Park Jin-seop Peter,
the chairman of Taekang,

343
00:33:57,661 --> 00:33:59,329
will offer a eulogy.

344
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,758
Remember how our housekeeper
would sometimes bring her baby over?

345
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:14,845
That baby had a unique name.

346
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:16,096
Bo-ri, was it?

347
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:20,100
How the hell would I remember
the name of some housekeeper's baby?

348
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,019
I saw it all, you know.

349
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:31,695
You're so noisy.

350
00:34:33,322 --> 00:34:34,740
<i>You covered his mouth shut.</i>

351
00:34:36,617 --> 00:34:37,993
I'm being serious.

352
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,329
- Really?
- <i>He survived, but he underwent surgery.</i>

353
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,415
<i>He almost lost his life.</i>

354
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:45,542
Did you ever…

355
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,463
tell anyone else about this?

356
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:51,673
I told Father.

357
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:56,720
So he knew all along.

358
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:02,851
So?

359
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:04,311
You used to take pills daily

360
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:07,356
because you kept hearing a baby crying.

361
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:08,774
- Do you still take them?
- What?

362
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:10,234
The pills in your fountain pen.

363
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:11,360
You thought I wouldn't know?

364
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,362
You son of a bitch!

365
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:14,988
Have you been digging up dirt on me?

366
00:35:16,824 --> 00:35:18,075
Why don't you get clean?

367
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,326
Oh, that's right.

368
00:35:20,828 --> 00:35:22,955
Maybe you can't
because you're weak-willed.

369
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:37,302
My will is much stronger

370
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,805
than you can ever imagine.

371
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,895
That's why I've kept you alive
all this time.

372
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:49,231
And another thing.

373
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:52,568
I didn't take them
because I could hear a baby crying.

374
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:56,071
It was because I kept hearing voices
telling me to kill.

375
00:36:12,296 --> 00:36:13,797
Jin-tae

376
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:17,134
was like a precious gift

377
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:19,887
to my wife and I.

378
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:21,680
Even now,

379
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:23,682
I miss him very much.

380
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:56,840
How long will he keep going on
about that dead bastard?

381
00:37:04,348 --> 00:37:05,724
I'm listening.

382
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:07,476
You were right.

383
00:37:08,352 --> 00:37:12,022
<i>Today's seminar was held</i>
<i>under Mr. Park's orders.</i>

384
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:07,619
Let's eat.
This is the reason we do this, isn't it?

385
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:12,249
How can you be so uncaring?

386
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:14,042
You couldn't have heated this up?

387
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:16,086
It'll get heated up
in your intestines anyway.

388
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:19,423
Why would you bring up my intestines
when I'm eating pig intestines?

389
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:21,758
You lack empathy as well.

390
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:28,265
Man, V8 engines sure are different.

391
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:31,935
Let's just leave this
to the traffic officers.

392
00:38:38,692 --> 00:38:41,528
Slow down, will you?

393
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:46,658
Just let them go.

394
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:48,285
Hey!

395
00:38:56,877 --> 00:38:57,753
That bastard!

396
00:39:04,051 --> 00:39:05,302
I've got you now.

397
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:36,208
Sir. You were speeding excessively.

398
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:37,959
Please show me your ID

399
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:39,503
and blow on this.

400
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:44,966
Why would he give out speeding tickets
when we're detectives?

401
00:39:48,637 --> 00:39:50,722
You were driving like that
without even drinking?

402
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:51,932
I'm giving you a ticket.

403
00:39:56,228 --> 00:39:57,813
Please be more careful next time.

404
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:06,738
Please step outside for a bit.

405
00:40:06,822 --> 00:40:08,281
I'll perform a simple inspection.

406
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:13,870
Damn it.

407
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:18,416
That was rude.

408
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:20,460
Why don't you take it easy?

409
00:40:20,544 --> 00:40:21,545
Please cooperate.

410
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:26,383
What did you say your name was?

411
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:30,762
Detective Woo Ji-hun
of Jungbu Police Station.

412
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,645
Hey, what's the matter?

413
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:40,897
Look at his pupils. I think he's high.

414
00:40:40,981 --> 00:40:42,732
Just let it go.

415
00:40:42,816 --> 00:40:44,860
He's Park Tae-u, the CEO of Taekang.

416
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,695
What's that got to do with anything?

417
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:48,905
Hello, Commissioner General Kim Nam-il.

418
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:53,535
You see, I was caught speeding a little.

419
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:56,079
All they have to do is give me a ticket,

420
00:40:57,247 --> 00:40:59,541
but Detective Woo Ji-hun
of Jungbu Police Station

421
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:02,169
keeps insisting
that I accompany him to the station.

422
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:05,422
Hold on.

423
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:11,761
- Yes, sir.
<i>- Do you want to lose your badge?</i>

424
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:14,222
<i>He's a busy man,</i>
<i>so just apologize and let him go!</i>

425
00:41:18,185 --> 00:41:19,227
Yes, sir.

426
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:26,568
I'll be seeing you around then.

427
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:34,868
I'm sorry, sir.

428
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:36,786
You may go.

429
00:41:37,454 --> 00:41:38,371
Let's go.

430
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:40,207
I don't want to.

431
00:41:43,627 --> 00:41:44,461
Excuse me.

432
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:47,547
Stay right there
if you want to keep your job.

433
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,611
That'll cover the damages.

434
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:20,789
Bootlickers like you know your place
and suck up to the powerful.

435
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:22,749
I like you.

436
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:26,544
You feed off the dead skin cells
of other people's feet.

437
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,729
This is my home.

438
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:28,940
What brings you by?

439
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:32,319
What else?

440
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:34,612
I came to see you, Mr. Park.

441
00:43:36,031 --> 00:43:36,865
What for?

442
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:46,333
Can't you tell what brought me by

443
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:48,168
even after seeing my work?

444
00:43:49,002 --> 00:43:50,587
Why don't you take your foot off?

445
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:04,726
Hey.

446
00:44:05,852 --> 00:44:07,729
There aren't any security cameras here.

447
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:12,692
I know.

448
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:16,321
Don't you think
I would've looked into that?

449
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:18,531
Why you little…

450
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:25,121
Hey.

451
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:27,457
Get lost.

452
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:49,479
What do you think you're doing?

453
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:51,981
If you hear
what I'm about to do to you now,

454
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,776
you'll come off that high a little.

455
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:04,536
Hey.

456
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:06,955
Have you ever been hit before?

457
00:45:07,247 --> 00:45:08,957
You son of a bitch.

458
00:45:58,131 --> 00:46:01,634
Why did he come all the way here
and cause such a commotion?

459
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:08,475
This will be a hassle to deal with.

460
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:14,772
What the…

461
00:46:21,488 --> 00:46:22,739
Get out of my car!

462
00:47:03,947 --> 00:47:04,948
Who the hell are you?

463
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:07,575
I shot you just now.

464
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:11,204
I anticipated that much.

465
00:47:11,955 --> 00:47:12,956
What?

466
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:15,250
I know a lot of things about you.

467
00:47:17,544 --> 00:47:18,586
Just wait.

468
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:22,173
I've made many special plans
for you tonight.

469
00:47:34,644 --> 00:47:37,355
I've killed 15 people at this studio.

470
00:47:38,398 --> 00:47:39,315
What?

471
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:45,071
Do you want to know
how I'm going to kill you?

472
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:48,032
First, I'll slowly sever off

473
00:47:48,116 --> 00:47:49,826
each of your fingers and toes

474
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:51,619
one by one.

475
00:47:51,703 --> 00:47:55,164
Then, I'll take a chainsaw

476
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:58,084
to make my way up
from your heels to your head.

477
00:47:59,419 --> 00:48:00,878
Do you know at what point

478
00:48:01,963 --> 00:48:04,465
the person loses consciousness
and dies in this process?

479
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:07,176
When is it?

480
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:08,970
See for yourself.

481
00:48:10,763 --> 00:48:13,349
It happens much later than you'd expect.

482
00:48:49,636 --> 00:48:50,720
What's wrong with him?

483
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:11,240
You're up.

484
00:49:33,596 --> 00:49:36,474
At first, I thought you were bluffing.

485
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:44,190
It turns out you truly had a playground.

486
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:47,151
A playground?

487
00:49:48,695 --> 00:49:51,197
You said you killed 15 people here, right?

488
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:04,001
You told me about your murders,

489
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:06,796
so I'll tell you about mine.

490
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:11,718
My first kill…

491
00:50:14,554 --> 00:50:15,638
was by accident.

492
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:28,651
Is this 911?

493
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:31,571
Someone's been hit by a car.

494
00:50:34,449 --> 00:50:36,701
I'm at the intersection outside Taekang.

495
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:41,789
Help me.

496
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:47,420
Please help me.

497
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:52,133
<i>He looked up at me as if I were a god.</i>

498
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:55,678
<i>He was begging me with his eyes.</i>

499
00:50:56,012 --> 00:50:57,430
To this very day…

500
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:02,143
I remember how electrifying it was.

501
00:51:02,769 --> 00:51:05,354
But no matter how many people
I ran over after that,

502
00:51:05,438 --> 00:51:08,232
I couldn't experience
the sensation I had felt then.

503
00:51:10,193 --> 00:51:11,402
But today,

504
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,906
hearing your story in the car

505
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:17,492
began to excite me.

506
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:20,203
I couldn't stop trembling.

507
00:51:24,332 --> 00:51:26,125
<i>Why didn't I think of that?</i>

508
00:51:26,334 --> 00:51:27,627
<i>I want to give it a go too.</i>

509
00:51:27,919 --> 00:51:29,420
<i>I want to experience it myself.</i>

510
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:33,883
You crazy bastard.

511
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:37,970
You'll never be able to beat me.

512
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:40,264
Winning and losing

513
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:44,101
depends on whether you're alive or not.

514
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,647
That's why I keep winning.

515
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:54,987
Because…

516
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:00,952
I always give back as much as I receive.

517
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:09,126
Now, I can either save you or kill you.

518
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,634
Why don't you start begging me…

519
00:52:18,845 --> 00:52:19,804
to spare you?

520
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:43,119
Kill me, you psychopath.

521
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:47,123
You fucking bastard!

522
00:53:23,451 --> 00:53:24,660
Hang in there.

523
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:26,787
We're only getting started.

524
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:19,173
That was the most painful death

525
00:54:20,091 --> 00:54:22,051
you've experienced until now.

526
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:24,845
You were cut, severed,

527
00:54:25,346 --> 00:54:26,847
crushed, and burned.

528
00:54:28,975 --> 00:54:30,601
You should still consider yourself lucky.

529
00:54:31,143 --> 00:54:32,853
If you had tried to kill him,

530
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:36,190
I would have intervened
and thrown you into hell.

531
00:54:58,879 --> 00:54:59,880
Did you

532
00:55:00,965 --> 00:55:02,925
get yourself killed on purpose?

533
00:56:54,995 --> 00:57:01,043
<i>Are you still standing there?</i>

534
00:57:01,794 --> 00:57:07,383
<i>Are you afraid to turn back?</i>

535
00:57:08,676 --> 00:57:14,723
<i>The face I somberly remembered</i>

536
00:57:15,266 --> 00:57:17,643
<i>The person I'm grateful for</i>

537
00:57:18,686 --> 00:57:20,729
<i>The person I owe</i>

538
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:28,070
<i>Although there's no miracle we hoped for</i>

539
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:35,202
<i>Nor the strength to get back on our feet</i>

540
00:57:35,286 --> 00:57:42,126
<i>Listen to the voice that embraces you</i>

541
00:57:42,418 --> 00:57:49,341
<i>"I love you"</i>

542
00:57:49,425 --> 00:57:54,972
<i>"I love you"</i>

543
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:21,665
<i>If you're still hesitating</i>
