1
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,720
You.

2
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,020
What are you doing?

3
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,200
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,730
Secret room.

5
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,130
We've entered the secret room.

6
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,480
Do you have a lighter?

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,060
I want to see what's actually in here.

8
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,100
I see it.

9
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,340
We finally made it in here.

10
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,720
Why is it empty?

11
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,440
This is what you're looking for.

12
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,940
None of your business.

13
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,400
Why are you everywhere?

14
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,840
I was wondering the same about you.

15
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,760
Then leave.

16
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,200
I...

17
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,000
You leave.

18
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,720
Why should I be the one to leave?

19
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,280
Bah!

20
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,200
You spit at me? So what?

21
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,960
You spit at me.

22
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,600
Go ahead, bite me.

23
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,920
If my sister doesn't come back soon

24
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,039
we'll be exposed.

25
00:01:58,759 --> 00:01:59,520
Miss Yun.

26
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,920
Where is Mr. Tian?

27
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,280
There was an issue at the manor.

28
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,080
My sister went back to handle it.

29
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,080
Where is Fu Mingyang?

30
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,220
Escorting Mr. Tian back to the manor.

31
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,560
It's such a short distance. Does he need an escort?

32
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,410
None of your damn business.

33
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,500
There are two deep scratches here

34
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,560
probably caused by dragging something heavy.

35
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,060
The items must have been moved recently.

36
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,380
There must be a door leading outside.

37
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,760
There's blood here.

38
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,520
I see it.

39
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,240
This must be where torture or murder took place.

40
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,079
Perhaps this blood belongs to the magistrate.

41
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,540
He killed the magistrate.

42
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,760
No, that's not right.

43
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,800
The magistrate died at home.

44
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,490
Then this blood must be his own.

45
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,360
He killed the magistrate and then got injured.

46
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,690
He returned to this secret room through the hidden passage.

47
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,620
Where's the evidence?

48
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,530
There isn't any.

49
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,050
But this must be connected to Liu Zhen.

50
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,880
You need evidence to make a judgment.

51
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,440
Otherwise, you can't convict him.

52
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,970
Why are you so determined to convict Liu Zhen?

53
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,600
I'm not necessarily trying to convict him.

54
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,600
It's just that...

55
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,000
The messenger's death this time

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,640
and the magistrate's murder case

57
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,960
are too coincidental.

58
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,560
Many aspects resemble a case from ten years ago

59
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,560
in a striking way.

60
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,980
You mean General Tian's case, right?

61
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,850
How do you know about it?

62
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,040
Everyone knows about General Tian's case.

63
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,640
Do you believe in General Tian?

64
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,440
Of course I do.

65
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,680
I served under him.

66
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,500
I know his character well.

67
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,600
If he really embezzled military funds and committed treason,

68
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,530
why would he return to the capital?

69
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,560
Because his family was in the capital.

70
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,600
That's nonsense.

71
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,080
If he wanted to get his wife, children and mother,

72
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,940
that would have been easy enough.

73
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,960
Sis, where are you?

74
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,610
Liu Zhen isn't here.

75
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,159
Liu Ke ate your terrible pastries again

76
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,440
and now has diarrhea.

77
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,040
What are you still afraid of?

78
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,400
Being so timid, how can you accomplish anything?

79
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,280
You're so capable. Let's go our separate ways.

80
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,880
Why do you keep following me?

81
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,840
We've searched everywhere else.

82
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,770
This place is the most suspicious.

83
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,010
My young master said

84
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,090
there should be a secret room here.

85
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,000
As if we needed your master to tell us that.

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,360
My sister already knew.

87
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,080
Young master! Young master!

88
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,480
Is anyone out there?

89
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,960
We're trapped inside.

90
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,680
Help! We're trapped in here!

91
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,700
Stop shouting.

92
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,890
The secret room is soundproof.

93
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,080
Then how do we get out?

94
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,650
It's not so bad staying in here.

95
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,360
Fu Dong.

96
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,800
Did you hear something?

97
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,580
Many hidden rooms are soundproof from the outside.

98
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,980
What should we do then?

99
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,370
How would I know?

100
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,930
We need to find the mechanism quickly.

101
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,360
Guards!

102
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,280
Guards!

103
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,600
Where are Tian Yun'er and Fudong?

104
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,260
When you were in the bathroom,

105
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,640
they both left.

106
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,730
Go to the provincial capital and find Master Liu.

107
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,840
Tell him there's an urgent matter to discuss.

108
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,240
Quickly, lock this door!

109
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,200
All right.

110
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,050
Tian Yuner, stop following me.

111
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,500
Let go of me.

112
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,040
Yuner.

113
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,200
Mom.

114
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,600
Where's your sister?

115
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,500
I'm talking to you. Where's your sister?

116
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,400
Isn't the holiday coming up?

117
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,000
My sister and Xiaoliu wanted to buy more ingredients

118
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,480
so they went to the provincial capital.

119
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,120
They probably won't be back tonight.

120
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,160
Mom, you should go to bed.

121
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,840
Why didn't your sister tell me?

122
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,040
You go to sleep first.

123
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,400
Stay away from me.

124
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,890
Do you have anything to eat?

125
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,760
This is all I have.

126
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,360
Thank you.

127
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,370
Here's half for you.

128
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,770
What happened to your hand?

129
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,520
You stepped on it, remember?

130
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,480
It's ugly.

131
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:50,880
Yes.

132
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,680
Of course I'm not as pretty as those girls at the brothel

133
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,560
or as charming.

134
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,340
Go find your singing birds and butterflies.

135
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,890
I was talking about my hand.

136
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:03,960
Then take it off.
