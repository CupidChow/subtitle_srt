1
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,160
Fu.

2
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,000
Fu Mingyang. Why is it you again?

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,680
I was about to ask why it's you again.

4
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,340
Aren't you fond of the pleasures of female company?

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,860
You've scared away all the beauties.

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,720
So naturally I'm not enjoying such pleasures.

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,720
Cut the nonsense.

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,960
What are you doing here?

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,160
Same purpose as you.

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,000
I received information.

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,730
The magistrate's death might be related to the military payroll robbery.

12
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,720
I served at the border for several years.

13
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,720
I can't just stand by and watch my brothers' money

14
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,580
fall into the hands of those rats.

15
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,370
Understand?

16
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,160
I didn't expect you to be so sentimental.

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,930
I thought you only cared about having fun.

18
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,120
In your information,

19
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,600
is there anything about the method

20
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,160
being identical to the one from ten years ago?

21
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,520
What's that to you?

22
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,000
Just imagine,

23
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,600
what was the magistrate doing when he was killed?

24
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,560
His first reaction to danger:

25
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,890
protect his family.

26
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,000
So he must have left something to help his family protect themselves.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,080
Sister, look.

28
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,960
This brush is actually hollow inside.

29
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,520
It can hide secret messages.

30
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,380
Take it with us.

31
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,140
I just found this underneath.

32
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,880
I'm taking over this case.

33
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,880
Why are you haunting me like a ghost?

34
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,200
Liuzi, are you okay?

35
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,039
Just a moment.

36
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,600
Take him away.

37
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:02,800
Yun'er.

38
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,560
I'm absolutely exhausted today.

39
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,520
Me too.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,720
Don't let Mother know about our little secret.

41
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,880
Mother.

42
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,329
Where have you been?

43
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,600
We went to the temple fair in town.

44
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,480
We waited until it ended.

45
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,120
Then our carriage broke down on the way back.

46
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,640
We spent hours fixing it in the dark.

47
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,840
If you don't believe me, ask Xiaoliuzi.

48
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,079
It's late. Go to bed now.

49
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,480
Mother, you go to bed first.

50
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,970
I want to sleep with my sister tonight.

51
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,079
Next time, come back earlier with your sister.

52
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,480
Let's go, Xiaoliuzi.

53
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,320
Thank goodness you were there today.

54
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,280
See?

55
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,700
I told you that you can't live without me.

56
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,320
Yes, yes. My little sister is the most capable.

57
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,200
Even better than having three heads and six arms.

58
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,480
Tian Jinjin.

59
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,160
How dare you call me a monster!

60
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,400
You'll pay for this!

61
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,920
Mercy, Lady Yun'er!

62
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,320
I was wrong. I won't dare again.

63
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,320
Never again.

64
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,760
Why aren't you two asleep yet?

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,240
What if we could stay like this forever?

66
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,120
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

67
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,920
But we are already like this.

68
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,360
Fu.

69
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,280
I just made some snacks with different flavors.

70
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,740
Would you like to try some?

71
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,600
Sure.

72
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,040
Don't blame my sister.

73
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,700
She didn't mean it yesterday.

74
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,120
The situation was too urgent.

75
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,600
Are you trying to make me remember

76
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,760
how she grabbed you and ran last night

77
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,880
after knocking me out with a stick?

78
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,000
No, I didn't.

79
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,640
Fuda.

80
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,530
Don't follow me.

81
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,240
What's wrong?

82
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,500
Young Master, where were you last night?

83
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,720
I drank too much at the entertainment house last night.

84
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,000
So I stayed at an inn.

85
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,560
Seems the entertainment house here is quite good.

86
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,400
More attractive than those in the capital.

87
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,500
Who taught you to be so cheeky?

88
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,960
Young Master.

89
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,280
Liu Ke just came looking for you to play chess.

90
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,080
Couldn't you just brush him off?

91
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,890
For the bigger picture,

92
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,680
we still need to humor him.

93
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,760
I understand.

94
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,650
Master Liu, your skills are superior.

95
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,240
I admit defeat.

96
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,800
General Fu, you're being too modest.

97
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,640
With your family background and upbringing,

98
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,570
chess must be child's play for you.

99
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,800
I still remember your father

100
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,680
was once a chess master himself.

101
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,500
It's a pity.

102
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,210
He's getting old

103
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,760
and has lost his competitive spirit.

104
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,120
What about you, General Fu?

105
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,690
I'm the same.

106
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,080
I prefer a peaceful and leisurely life.

107
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,200
No war,

108
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,420
no scheming and plotting.

109
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,520
Nice decoration.

110
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,000
Mr. Liu.

111
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,800
May I borrow this book?

112
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,159
I never lend out my books

113
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,560
or my women.

114
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:04,940
Xiaoliuzi.

115
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,300
Cut these carrots.

116
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,240
I'm kneading dough. Cut them yourself.

117
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,100
Aren't you a big boy now? Come on, cut them yourself.

118
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,540
Xiaoliuzi.

119
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,960
Liu Zhen will be away on business for a few days.

120
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,160
Follow him from a distance.

121
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,800
Report any unusual situations immediately.

122
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,530
Understood.

123
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,560
Yun'er, let's go check the post station again.

124
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,080
Everyone!

125
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,280
For next month's Zhengyang Festival,

126
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,120
we've specially prepared some new dishes

127
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,480
for you all to try.

128
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,680
Thank you, Manager Tian.

129
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,760
Thank you, Miss Tian.

130
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,920
If you enjoy the food,

131
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,840
remember to bring your family and friends during the Zhengyang Festival.

132
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,040
I promise a 20% discount for everyone.

133
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,240
How generous of you, Miss Tian.

134
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,100
By the way, where is Official Liu?

135
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,500
Over there.

136
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,800
Alright, enjoy your meal.

137
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,760
Got it? Go now, hurry up.

138
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,960
Brother Liu.

139
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,720
Miss Tian Yuner.

140
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,760
Manager Tian.

141
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,520
I made these pastries specially for you. Try them.

142
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:03,980
Really?

143
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,680
How is it? Delicious?

144
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,840
Let's go. There's better food ahead.

145
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,320
Really?

146
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,960
Why would I lie? It's true.

147
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,690
Alright. Let me close the door.

148
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,410
It's fine. Don't worry about it. Let's go.

149
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,740
Coming, buddy.

150
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,520
You're using a diversion tactic.

151
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,050
Pretending to deliver food while actually trying to steal something.

152
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,260
None of your business.

153
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,000
How is it not my business?

154
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,300
I'm a member of this post station now.

155
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,760
Whatever you're trying to steal could affect

156
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,090
the future interests of our post station.

157
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,200
Are you going to confess willingly

158
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,760
or should I force it out of you?
