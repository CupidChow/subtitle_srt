1
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,160
Why are you sighing at such a young age?

2
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,160
Do you have something troubling you too?

3
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,040
Sis.

4
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,480
Tell me, what does it feel like to like someone?

5
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,330
I don't really know.

6
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,520
It's like eating candied haws.

7
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,840
Sweet and sour?

8
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,760
Like eating scrambled eggs with Chinese toon.

9
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,060
Or like eating sticky rice-stuffed lotus root.

10
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,920
Take how I care about you for example.

11
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,380
You're always in my heart.

12
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,680
When I don't see you every day,

13
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,280
I feel like something's missing.

14
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,320
When you're happy, I'm happy too.

15
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,760
And when you're sad,

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,600
I want to cheer you up.

17
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:21,840
Yun'er,

18
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,850
you haven't fallen for someone, have you?

19
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,160
No way. I was just asking.

20
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:29,800
Sis.

21
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:31,840
I've decided.

22
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,600
I want to become strong like you.

23
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,600
Silly Yun'er.

24
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,570
You're already wonderful.

25
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,240
Your sister even envies you.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,060
Brother, that matter is almost done.

27
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,760
Don't get carried away.

28
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:05,800
Sir.

29
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,960
Our informant has sent news.

30
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,680
The border troops are restless. Supplies are low.

31
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,920
They haven't received wages for two months.

32
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,050
Some have already started causing small disturbances.

33
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,579
Don't celebrate too soon.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,660
When the birds are gone, the good bow is put away.

35
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,440
When the hare is caught, the hound is cooked.

36
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,090
Given your relationship with Lord He,

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,600
you can't go too far, can you?

38
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,000
There's no kinship in royal affairs.

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,120
Let alone for people like us.

40
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,680
Brother Fu,

41
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,480
take a look at this. Is this the government silver you're looking for?

42
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,079
Look.

43
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,330
Longyu Army.

44
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:06,980
Take a look.

45
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,560
Where did this silver come from?

46
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,120
Xiaoliuzi found it at the entrance.

47
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,400
I heard that in many places around the city,

48
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,460
people are using this kind of silver.

49
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,600
Be careful.

50
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,560
[8 Commander Qin]

51
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,500
The government silver will arrive in five days.

52
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,000
I'll need you to deliver it to the destination.

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,660
Your payment will be doubled.

54
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,440
Didn't we agree before

55
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,420
that it would be just once?

56
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,060
Plans can't keep up with changes.

57
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,480
I'll always keep your little secret.

58
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,490
But the magistrate's death...

59
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,440
Finding the killer is the government's responsibility.

60
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,480
Everyone wants to be the lotus that rises unsullied from the mud.

61
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,720
But who wants to be the fish that takes the bait?

62
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,760
Commander Qin, I hear government silver is circulating freely in the city.

63
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,560
This is the fault of a father who raises but doesn't teach.

64
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:37,159
The eldest brother is like a father.

65
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,159
Tell me, should I release this fish

66
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,560
or should I cook it?

67
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,680
It's about to rain.

68
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,640
Really?

69
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,480
Now we've lost all our leads.

70
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,600
You went through all that trouble to get the official silver from Young Master Qin.

71
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,730
Couldn't you have kept it as evidence?

72
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,880
No, that wasn't enough.

73
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,940
You had to show off.

74
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,520
Testing the waters, right?

75
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,240
Testing the waters.

76
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,640
Now you haven't found the way.

77
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,340
And you've lost the stone too. Happy now?

78
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,760
The stone is still there,

79
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,040
just buried under more stones.

80
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,640
The newly released government silver could be a smokescreen,

81
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,960
meant to confuse us

82
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,700
and disrupt our thinking.

83
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,960
This proves we've hit on something crucial.

84
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,240
Sister.

85
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,560
Sister.

86
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,560
Where's this crucial point?

87
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,360
I don't see it.

88
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,040
Listen to me.

89
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,560
Keep investigating Commander Qin.

90
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,760
No, he's too cunning.

91
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,960
Hard to deal with.

92
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,880
Let's start with Young Master Qin instead.

93
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,360
The more thorough the investigation,

94
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,760
the more likely we'll find a breakthrough.

95
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,520
Why should I listen to you?

96
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,560
Because you're stupid.

97
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,690
I don't accept that!

98
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,520
Then don't listen to me anymore if you dare.

99
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,090
I won't stoop to your level.

100
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,210
You're going the wrong way!

101
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,800
Commander, something terrible has happened!

102
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,860
The young master has been kidnapped.

103
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,840
Who did it?

104
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,360
I've heard there are refugees everywhere recently.

105
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,490
And there are more bandits in the area.

106
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,480
Could it be...

107
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,210
Go investigate immediately. Yes.

108
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,600
Wait.

109
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,440
Also look into Liu Zhen's whereabouts for the past 15 days.

110
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,170
Understood.

111
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,080
May Buddha bless my young master.

112
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,060
Turn misfortune into blessing and danger into safety.

113
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,720
I also hope that the case of the stolen government silver

114
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,920
will be solved soon

115
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,680
so my master can be reinstated.

116
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,320
I'm afraid your wish won't come true.

117
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,570
We've already found the suspects.

118
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,890
That could be false.

119
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,080
Anyway, a new shipment of government silver will arrive soon.

120
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,970
They will strike again.

121
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,930
No immediate arrests allowed.

122
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,080
Why?

123
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,760
The Prince's orders cannot be questioned.

124
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,960
Remember what your task is.

125
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,610
By any means necessary,

126
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,560
you must stop Fu Mingyang.

127
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,170
If Prince Ning's plans are ruined,

128
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,520
we're all finished.

129
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,480
Young Master.

130
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,000
Today is Tian Yun'er's birthday.

131
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,480
Mrs. Tian invited us to join them.

132
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,480
You all can go to this girly event without me.

133
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:39,280
But your wound hasn't healed yet.

134
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,090
This minor injury doesn't matter, Young Master.

135
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,000
What are you doing? Don't go.

136
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,440
I...

137
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,120
Fu Mingyang, why don't you understand?

138
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,680
Fu Dong means that

139
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,160
the information you received might not be accurate,

140
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,360
and it could be a trap.

141
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,520
Besides, your wound hasn't healed yet,

142
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,480
so don't go for now.

143
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,810
Mind your own business.

144
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,280
Don't go.

145
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,800
Ridiculous.

146
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,920
Sister, you're so kind.

147
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,360
I've wanted these hairpins for a long time.

148
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,000
Mother said they were too expensive.

149
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,800
You shouldn't spoil her so much.

150
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,480
You should get something nice for yourself too.

151
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,360
This young lady

152
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,280
is of marriageable age now.

153
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,640
Mother, there's no rush for that.

154
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,760
That's right.

155
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,320
I want my sister to stay with me for a few more years.

156
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,240
You're not worried, but I am.

157
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,200
Look at Mr. Wang's daughter next door.

158
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,520
Her child is already running around.

159
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,160
And you.

160
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,160
The Zhang family's youngest daughter your age

161
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,290
is already married.

162
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,890
You're not worried about becoming old maids?

163
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,080
I'm getting headaches worrying for you.

164
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,200
Jinjin is a girl with great ambitions.

165
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,000
She shouldn't be confined to this small courtyard.

166
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,400
Mrs. Tian, if Jinjin can't find a husband,

167
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,050
I'll be her last resort.

168
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,530
I wouldn't dare aim so high.

169
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,960
Who are you?

170
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,560
Back in the day, my grandfather owned half of the busiest street in Korea.

171
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,440
The renowned descendant of Park Banjie

172
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,960
cannot lower himself to common folk.

173
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,640
But now he's still your landlord, isn't he?

174
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,920
For Yun'er's birthday gift,

175
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,560
one piece of premium silk fabric,

176
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,560
and another for Jinjin. How's that?

177
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,130
I'm generous, aren't I?

178
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,120
Thank you for your generosity, Your Highness.

179
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,160
The second half year's rent,

180
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,960
don't forget.

181
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,080
Brothers, pick up the pace!

182
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,240
50 miles ahead

183
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,940
is the territory of the Central City Patrol.

184
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:13,960
Once we get there,

185
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,400
