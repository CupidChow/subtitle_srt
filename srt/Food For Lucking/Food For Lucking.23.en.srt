1
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,520
Liu Zhen.

2
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,320
There's a food shortage in Central City.

3
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,320
People can barely feed themselves.

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,480
Yet you're still in the mood to play with flowers.

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,680
Master Fu.

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,880
Even if I run around with you,

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,930
will that stop people from starving to death?

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,770
Think of something.

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,760
What can I possibly do?

10
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,760
Didn't you send people to transport grain from the city?

11
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,880
How's that going?

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,160
No news.

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,200
Young Master.

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,880
I swear, master and servant are just the same.

15
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,610
You never knock before entering someone's room.

16
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,580
Ignore him.

17
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,880
Young Master.

18
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,680
There's no grain left in any village within ten miles of Central City.

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,280
The granaries in every county have been cleaned out as if looted.

20
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,680
Then look in other provinces.

21
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,560
We've checked everywhere.

22
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,800
Nothing in the entire province.

23
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,480
Only in a province a thousand miles south,

24
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,360
the rice will be ready for harvest in a few days.

25
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,960
But harvesting and transportation

26
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,160
will take some time.

27
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:19,370
Handle it as you see fit.

28
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,200
I wanted to save his life,

29
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:01,440
but it turned into a death warrant instead.

30
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,280
I'll go arrest the guards on duty

31
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,240
and interrogate them thoroughly.

32
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,040
We'll get something out of them.

33
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,880
Be careful, young master.

34
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,810
Search quickly.

35
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,520
Master Fu.

36
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,800
It's you.

37
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,329
The biggest mole in Zhongshu City.

38
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,640
Lord He's biggest lackey.

39
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,720
I thought you'd gotten smarter.

40
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,410
I've been waiting here specifically for you.

41
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,450
What do you mean?

42
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,060
The Magistrate not only controls

43
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,520
the economic networks of towns near Zhongshu City.

44
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,720
For the past 10 years,

45
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,840
he has secretly collected evidence

46
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,000
of corruption from officials everywhere.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,800
This includes some of Lord He's private affairs.

48
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,600
So he sent you to kill him?

49
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:14,800
No.

50
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,079
Liu Ke and I never take lives.

51
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,010
Even the previous postal guard

52
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,920
was only seriously injured in the interrogation room.

53
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,040
My job is to ensure everyone can walk away safely.

54
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,600
That makes sense.

55
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,079
Sis.

56
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,320
You can't blame me.

57
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,800
I used to share everything good with you.

58
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,400
Why now

59
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,740
you clearly said you didn't like him?

60
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,000
But I do,

61
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,700
yet you're trying to take him from me.

62
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,920
I gave you everything I had.

63
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,840
Are you still the sister

64
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,300
who wanted to give me the best of everything?

65
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,410
You've changed.

66
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,840
You abandoned me first.

67
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,040
It's not my fault.

68
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,520
It's not my fault.

69
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,920
According to Lord He's investigation.

70
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,980
The prefect was once General Tianbuwei's subordinate

71
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,610
who pretended loyalty just to find evidence.

72
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,760
Later, he sent his trusted man to kill the prefect

73
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,240
to either obtain or destroy the evidence.

74
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,640
He informed me you would be appointed to Zhongshu City

75
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,080
to pin the murder on you.

76
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,740
So the Officials' Records are in your hands.

77
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,540
These Officials' Records

78
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,460
have ruined countless lives.

79
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,560
Today I'm giving these Officials' Records to you, Lord Fu.

80
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,720
Whether to use them and how

81
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,000
is entirely your decision.

82
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:17,920
By the way.

83
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,200
Manager Tian took a box

84
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,040
from the prefect's residence.

85
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,500
If these Officials' Records become public,

86
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,320
she might become a target.

87
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,320
I never expected that the Officials' Chronicles everyone's been longing for

88
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,450
would ultimately be found by Liu Zhen.

89
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,440
Go in.

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,680
He Shuhui,

91
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,980
what are you doing?

92
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,440
You treacherous scoundrel!

93
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,940
Greed truly leads to one's downfall.

94
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,960
You dare dream of becoming Yang's concubine?

95
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,640
You're not even worthy to carry his shoes.

96
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,520
Stupid woman.

97
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,730
Just wait until you and your sister

98
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,480
are both sold abroad by me.

99
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,120
He Shuhui, I'll kill you!

100
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,680
The treasury has been robbed. Why haven't you reported it yet?

101
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,640
We still need the most crucial key to open the treasury.

102
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,120
I just received news of a mutiny at the border.

103
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,480
Did the Prince's advisors fail to deliver the official silver to the border?

104
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,480
The silver is already at the border.

105
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,080
But there are traitors among the commanders.

106
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,940
After they're purged,

107
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,480
the wages will be distributed naturally.

108
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,760
I sent the list of traitors by carrier pigeon yesterday.

109
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,400
Please ask the Prince to verify it further.

110
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,760
About the Officials' Chronicles we discussed last time,

111
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,060
how is it progressing?

112
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,800
It should come to a conclusion now.

113
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,460
Give it to Prince Ning? No way.

114
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,560
Once the Officials' Chronicles is published,

115
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,240
it will certainly cause a bloodbath in the official circles.

116
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,760
The country will fall into chaos.

117
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,400
There's no progress at all.

118
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,280
No progress.

119
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,560
Fu Dong.

120
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,930
You better think carefully

121
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,040
about the consequences of betraying Prince Ning.

122
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,920
Fu Dong.

123
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,640
Let's go.

124
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:43,679
Come on.

125
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,220
What's wrong with you?

126
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,720
Young Master.

127
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,520
I have something to tell you.

128
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,560
I have something to tell you too.

129
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,920
The mastermind behind that incident was Lord He.

130
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,820
He was escorting a shipment of supplies.

131
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,080
What's wrong?

132
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,600
Young Master.

133
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,760
I'm sorry.

134
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,800
I'm Prince Ning's spy.

135
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,200
Since I started following you as a child,

136
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,330
it was all arranged by Prince Ning.

137
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,980
I've betrayed your information to Prince Ning.

138
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,200
Fu Dong.

139
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,140
I've failed the Fu family.

140
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,290
I've failed you, Young Master.

141
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,920
I don't ask for forgiveness.

142
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,840
Fu Dong.

143
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,680
Young Master.

144
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,120
Fu Dong.

145
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,520
I have no face to live in this world anymore.

146
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,130
After telling you all this,

147
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,640
I have no regrets.

148
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,160
Let go!

149
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,400
Let go!

150
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,600
Fudong.

151
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,380
Let me tell you a story.

152
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,200
I have a good friend.

153
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,480
She accompanied me to the fifth rank

154
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,880
and to the post stations.

155
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,280
Solving cases together.

156
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,290
Standing by me through thick and thin.

157
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,420
I don't care who she is.

158
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,400
I only know she's my brother.

159
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,000
Okay?

160
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,800
Young Master.

161
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,960
Alright, get up.

162
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,460
That's enough.

163
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,290
Stop crying.

164
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,200
Young Master, have you really forgiven me?

165
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,120
Of course.

166
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,480
You're my brother.

167
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,960
Quick, go find me some wound medicine.

168
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,800
I'll get that medicine for you.

169
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,280
Master Fu,

170
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,880
something terrible has happened!

171
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,800
The innkeeper and Miss Yun'er have both disappeared.

172
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,360
What?

173
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,080
When did this happen?

174
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,480
Oh right, look at this.

175
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,840
Master Fu.

176
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,840
I beg you,

177
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,520
please save my daughter.

178
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,560
And Jinjin too.
