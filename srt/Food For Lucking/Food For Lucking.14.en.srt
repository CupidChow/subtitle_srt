1
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:23,760
Jinjin.

2
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:27,880
Thank you.

3
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,560
Although we only got back 5 boxes of government silver today,

4
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,080
at least it wasn't a wasted trip.

5
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,000
There should be more than 5 boxes.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,680
Look at this.

7
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,200
These are just ordinary stones.

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,240
It's silver.

9
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,240
Indeed.

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,480
Stones that can substitute for silver,

11
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,120
which explains where the silver went.

12
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,920
Stones of this material and size

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,890
are abundant in only one place.

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,420
That's where my sister and I used to play when we were young -

15
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,880
the gravel pile behind Lehuo Manor.

16
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,820
Come on, sis. Let's go.

17
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,440
Sisterly Love.

18
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,200
Xiaoliu.

19
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,560
We're almost done here.

20
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,090
Go check how Yun'er is doing with the digging.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,640
Fudong.

22
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,480
Exactly twenty boxes of government silver,

23
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,410
not one missing.

24
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,360
Go inform Prince Ning's confidants

25
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,759
to come and transport the silver.

26
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:36,320
Yes.

27
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,570
That's enough. Stop counting. You've reached five.

28
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,039
I believe that in certain aspects,

29
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,360
you do have your own unique qualities.

30
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,800
So I've decided

31
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,720
to make you my friend.

32
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,720
Good friend.

33
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,780
Yun'er, what's wrong?

34
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,380
What happened? A hand!

35
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,120
A hand!

36
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,520
A hand! A dead person!

37
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,900
It's okay. Don't look.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,240
I have something to tell you.

39
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,280
I have something to tell you too.

40
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,160
I'll go first.

41
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,650
Whatever. You go first.

42
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,780
Although the body has started to decompose,

43
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,200
judging from the fallen fingernail on the ring finger,

44
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,800
he's most likely the previous postal guard.

45
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,400
Yes,

46
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,079
he's also the one mentioned in the magistrate's hidden letter,

47
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:43,800
the suspicious postal guard under Commander Qin.

48
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,460
He worked for the magistrate.

49
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,640
He was killed after being tortured.

50
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,720
That's right.

51
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,160
The magistrate probably had more evidence,

52
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,120
which is why he was silenced.

53
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,880
But now we've hit another dead end.

54
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,280
There was nothing on the postal guard's body,

55
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,080
and we have nowhere else to look.

56
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,320
Yun'er.

57
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,800
What's wrong with you?

58
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,130
Are you feeling unwell?

59
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,880
Ever since I thought about that arm,

60
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,680
I've been feeling terrible.

61
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,360
It's disgusting.

62
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,130
You're being dramatic. It's nothing.

63
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,210
Is the station master here?

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Come. Tell me what's going on.

65
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,280
An urgent imperial decree.

66
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,400
The granaries of Zhongshu City are to be used to support the border.

67
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,520
If there's a shortage of grain,

68
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,360
some can be requisitioned from the people.

69
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,800
This is an urgent document

70
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,079
that must be delivered to Station Master Liu

71
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,880
and Grain Official Du for immediate execution.

72
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,320
Are you sure you can pass on the message?

73
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,520
Don't be ridiculous.

74
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,560
Xiao Ding, come here.

75
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,760
Go back and tell your sister Jinjin

76
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,160
that Zhongshu City's granaries will be sent to the border.

77
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,160
Grain prices will definitely rise.

78
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,800
Tell her to stockpile grain.

79
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,079
What are you doing here?

80
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,399
This is a restricted granary area.

81
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,680
No unauthorized entry.

82
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,940
So you know this is a restricted granary.

83
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,240
Let's see

84
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,640
what's left here.

85
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,040
The dust piles are higher than the rice.

86
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,760
Where's the grain you're supposed to protect?

87
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,880
Our Lord Du said

88
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,900
to clear out last year's old grain

89
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,400
so the new grain can come in.

90
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,860
Well, hasn't this year's grain arrived yet?

91
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,800
Bring Du Yanzhi to me.

92
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,360
Go around to all the nearby villages and beat the drums.

93
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,400
Tell the villagers

94
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,720
to bring any surplus grain to the post station to sell. Hurry!

95
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,360
Yes, sir.

96
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,680
Liu Ke.

97
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,280
I don't trust them to handle this.

98
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,600
I'll have to trouble you to make a trip.

99
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,000
The more grain we collect, the better.

100
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,730
Alright.

101
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,080
Official Liu, please save me!

102
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,760
This is truly my first offense.

103
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,280
I won't dare do it again.

104
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,800
Officer Du, your rank is the same as mine.

105
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,640
How am I supposed to save you?

106
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,120
You're young and capable with many ideas.

107
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,600
Please help me think of a solution.

108
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,880
What should I do?

109
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,320
Liu Ke sold the old rice for me.

110
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,360
The new rice, due to weather conditions,

111
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,080
is ripening later than usual.

112
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,900
It hasn't been collected yet.

113
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,450
What will I load onto the ships bound for the border in five days?

114
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,280
You got what you deserved for being penny-wise and pound-foolish.

115
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,880
Just focus on your work.

116
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:52,400
Stop dreaming about promotions and getting rich.

117
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,960
When free money falls from the sky,

118
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,320
everyone wants it.

119
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,360
Why would it fall into your lap?

120
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,280
Hey.

121
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,120
Fudong.

122
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:10,920
Fudong.

123
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,210
Help me taste these.

124
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,810
Which flavor of pastry might Brother Fu like?

125
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,570
He doesn't like any of them.

126
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,440
The post station is too busy today.

127
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,880
I'm going to get the young master's lunch.

128
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,640
Go ahead.

129
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,520
My sister has already prepared it.

130
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,520
If he doesn't like them, I'll make some improvements.

131
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,480
Tian Yuner.

132
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,100
The young master doesn't like pastries.

133
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,800
I don't like pastries.

134
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,409
But making desserts is the only thing I'm good at.

135
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,720
I understand now.

136
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,240
Most pastries are sweet.

137
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,680
Brother Fu probably doesn't like overly sweet things.

138
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,740
I'll try something savory next time.

139
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,020
Sister Yun'er.

140
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,600
Sister Yun'er.

141
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,880
I heard that grain prices might increase soon.

142
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,240
Ask Sister Jinjin to stock up on more grain.

143
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,640
I got it. Do you

144
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,120
have any food? This looks...

145
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,650
Love really does make people foolish.

146
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,900
I'll give you some advice.

147
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,250
What advice?

148
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,240
Such an important matter as storing grain

149
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,370
should be left to me.

150
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,300
I'll come to you next time.

151
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,240
Fine, take it.

152
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,040
Brother Fu won't eat it anyway.

153
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,100
Sister.

154
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,730
There's a rouge shop ahead.

155
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,159
Come with me to see the shopkeeper.

156
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,760
Yun'er, it's time to go home.

157
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,140
Just a little longer, please.

158
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,010
Shopkeeper.

159
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:46,159
Why are there so many people in front of the grain shop?

160
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,600
Oh no.

161
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,080
Official Ding came looking for you yesterday when you weren't home.

162
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,600
He told me grain prices would rise.

163
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,460
He suggested we stock up on grain.

164
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,360
It's fine.

165
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,159
Xiao Liuzi was going to buy grain today anyway.

166
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,480
Go away! We're out of grain.

167
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,380
Move along!

168
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,320
Shopkeeper!

169
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,560
Liuzi.

170
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,680
Grain prices have gone up.

171
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,440
Rice and flour prices have multiplied.

172
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,120
Today's supply has been sold out.

173
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,040
How will we run the estate's business now?

174
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,370
Don't worry.

175
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,200
Sir, Official Liu.

176
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,760
Liu Zhen.

177
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,200
Connected to the government silver robbery case.

178
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,799
Colluding with foreigners.

179
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,380
And now involved in the grain price inflation scandal.

180
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,320
Official Liu is quite a complicated character.

181
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,280
Are you looking to die? Right here on this busy street?

182
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,090
Forgive me, sir. The situation is urgent.

183
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,210
The government silver is gone.

184
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,360
Useless fools!

185
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,490
What do I pay you for?

186
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,180
It was indeed because of food.

187
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,650
Those scoundrels couldn't resist their appetites.

188
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,280
Two women switched the silver with stones.

189
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,000
It took days to discover.

190
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,680
Sir.

191
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,120
I've told you. This has nothing to do with me.

192
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,160
Why come to me now?

193
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,600
Go find the suspects!

194
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,400
According to the guards' recollection,

195
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,680
that day they ate drugged meat.

196
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,520
It was extremely delicious.

197
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,500
It must have contained this rare Western spice.

198
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,920
I'd like to ask you to investigate

199
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,040
who has purchased this kind of spice.

200
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:47,840
Get out!

201
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,280
Sir, those ten boxes of silver... Get out!
