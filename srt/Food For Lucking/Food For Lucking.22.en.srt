1
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,480
If I don't see Manager Tian today,

2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,080
I'm not leaving.

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,960
I'll sleep right here.

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,480
Manager Tian!

5
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,320
Manager Tian!

6
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,480
For the sake of our past friendship,

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,320
please save me!

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,200
I've gotten into serious trouble.

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,280
Officer Du, please get up.

10
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,340
Tell me slowly.

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,720
These commoners threw mud at me,

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,520
calling me a corrupt official

13
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,240
who's driving up grain prices.

14
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,280
I didn't want to do it!

15
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,610
So you're saying

16
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,400
half of what's on the grain ship is...

17
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,840
It's just chaff and bran.

18
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,320
The granaries are empty.

19
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,720
Grain prices have risen.

20
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,180
No matter how wealthy I am,

21
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,280
I can't afford provisions for an army of 100,000.

22
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,920
So I just...

23
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,039
What happened to the old grain in the storehouse?

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,840
I sold it to a northern grain merchant half a month ago.

25
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,840
When the border requested grain,

26
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,880
I went to find him,

27
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,920
but he was already gone without a trace.

28
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,490
Don't follow me.

29
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,680
I need to find Jinjin.

30
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,479
Young master.

31
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,640
Report!

32
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:42,720
Lord Fu.

33
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,120
The grain ships have been hijacked.

34
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,960
Keep this information confidential.

35
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,220
Those who disobey will be executed. Yes.

36
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,780
I have a shipment of grain.

37
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,720
It's stored in the northern region.

38
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,580
Let's send it to the border first.

39
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,450
Thank you, Lord Liu.

40
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,240
I accept your pledge of loyalty.

41
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,720
This jade pendant of General Tian's.

42
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,979
It's suitable as my token of allegiance.

43
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,360
Where did you find it?

44
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,120
The night the prefect was assassinated.

45
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,920
I picked it up.

46
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,079
General Tian wasn't afraid of death.

47
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:25,340
But he shouldn't be wrongfully accused.

48
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,280
Jinjin, I'm coming in.

49
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,120
Jinjin?

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,260
You have to believe me.

51
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,090
There's nothing between He Shuhui and me.

52
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,980
She's been clinging to me since we were kids.

53
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,320
I can't shake her off.

54
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,760
Jinjin? Jinjin? I'm coming in.

55
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,600
Is that so?

56
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,480
Then why did you rush into my room?

57
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,000
I never thought.

58
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,920
General Fu would be a gentleman during the day,

59
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,280
but turn into a lecherous devil at night.

60
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,320
He Shuhui!

61
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,660
A woman should know propriety and shame.

62
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,620
Why are you in Tian Jinjin's room?

63
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,320
What have you done to Tian Jinjin?

64
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,400
Why don't you guess?

65
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,730
Beg me and I'll tell you.

66
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,410
Where is everyone? Stop shouting.

67
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,610
Help! Stop yelling.

68
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,280
Um, Jinjin, I need to talk to you about something.

69
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,280
Do you believe me?

70
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,860
What business do you have that must be discussed

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,079
when I'm trying to sleep?

72
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:54,079
I was busy with work and lost track of time. What's wrong?

73
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,280
Stop making excuses.

74
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,160
Brother Yang,

75
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,040
you came here specifically for me.

76
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,080
Just admit it.

77
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,850
No one will laugh at you.

78
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,120
I really came to see Tian Jinjin.

79
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,120
Am I not enough for you?

80
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,320
You want to take advantage of Manager Tian too?

81
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,780
I never thought you were this kind of person.

82
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,290
You're wronging me.

83
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,079
Jinjin, let me explain.

84
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,920
Explain nothing, you creep!

85
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:24,920
Jinjin!

86
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,400
Fudong, please go talk to her for me.

87
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,330
You know me best.

88
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,240
Serves you right.

89
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:29,840
Fudong!

90
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,120
Mr. Piao!

91
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,580
You're on your own.

92
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,120
I...

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,600
I...

94
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,400
He Shuhui!

95
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,010
Don't go!

96
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,250
Actually, if you look closely,

97
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,880
Miss Tian is quite beautiful.

98
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,760
It's just that her clothes are a bit plain.

99
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,160
Why not use this money

100
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,240
to dress yourself up nicely,

101
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,040
so you can attract men's attention?

102
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,840
I've known for a while

103
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,000
that you like Yang.

104
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,440
I promise you,

105
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,880
if you help me get rid of Tian Jinjin,

106
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,320
I'll make you my favored concubine.

107
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,480
Don't joke around.

108
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,120
She's my sister.

109
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,159
Besides, your position as the main wife

110
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,460
isn't guaranteed.

111
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,800
My aunt is the Empress.

112
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,960
With an imperial marriage decree, nothing can change.

113
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,280
Of course, if you fancy any nobleman,

114
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,570
I can help arrange that for you.

115
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,760
And think about it carefully.

116
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,440
This sister of yours,

117
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,810
she's not your blood sister after all.

118
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,200
If a woman chooses the right man,

119
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,040
she can secure a comfortable life forever.

120
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,880
I've had a bond with her for 10 years.

121
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,860
I can't just watch her die.

122
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,010
I can't do it.

123
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,570
I'm not that heartless.

124
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,280
Actually,

125
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,200
we just need to tie her up first,

126
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,920
then send her penniless to the far north.

127
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,620
It won't cost her life.

128
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,040
Only this way

129
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,000
will she never disturb

130
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,080
our lives again.

131
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,159
Let's go.

132
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,360
Please keep me here, ma'am.

133
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,900
Get up quickly.

134
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,680
Don't you have parents?

135
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,680
My mother said my father was killed by bandits.

136
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,120
Please let me stay, ma'am.

137
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,720
I can do any kind of work.

138
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,640
I can cook and do laundry.

139
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,240
I learn quickly and eat very little.

140
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,720
Time to close the net.

141
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,680
Go to the prison and clear out those who need clearing.

142
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,960
Kill those who need to be killed.

143
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,200
Go.

144
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,480
Jinjin.

145
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,180
There's really nothing between us like what you're thinking.

146
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,409
Jinjin, between me and He Shuhui, there's really...

147
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,570
Fu Mingyang.

148
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,360
An urgent letter from Master Du.

149
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,600
Jinjin.

150
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,160
There's really nothing between me and He Shuhui.

151
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,440
That night when I went to your room,

152
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,000
I was only telling you about Master Du's matter.

153
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,280
I have a new solution.

154
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,880
Zhongshu City will have grain supplies soon.

155
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,560
You.

156
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,000
I and...

157
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,620
Brother Fu.

158
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,120
Brother Fu, I made some snacks.

159
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,320
Would you like to try some?

160
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,160
No, thanks.

161
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,560
Brother Fu.

162
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,120
Can't you really see how good I am to you?

163
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,880
I've tried so hard to become someone you'd like.

164
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,880
Why can't you like me?

165
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,080
Yun'er.

166
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,360
I only see you as a sister.

167
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,320
Jinjin.

168
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,160
Jinjin.

169
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,900
You're not thinking of jumping into the river, are you?

170
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,200
Of course not.

171
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,680
I'm just out here enjoying the scenery.

172
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,280
You must have been rejected by Yang again.

173
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,040
You're no different.

174
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,680
Work with me.

175
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,920
If we succeed,

176
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,280
you can get everything you want.

177
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,400
Even if we fail,

178
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,520
you won't lose anything.

179
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:23,730
Let's go.

180
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,520
Okay.

181
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,160
Mother, please let my sister stay.

182
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,360
I want someone to keep me company while I work.

183
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,840
Alright, child.

184
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,800
Good, stay here.

185
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,640
Then I'll stay.

186
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,570
What I have lost,

187
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,600
they must lose too.
