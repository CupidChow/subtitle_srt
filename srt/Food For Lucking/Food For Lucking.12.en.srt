1
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:16,980
Innkeeper.

2
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,490
Look at this, everyone.

3
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,240
Fu Dong.

4
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,280
The wagon tracks disappear right here.

5
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,740
How did they transport all that silver away?

6
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,160
How did they move it?

7
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,480
That's the question.

8
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,240
Fu Dong.

9
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,370
Let's go back and discuss this.

10
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:35,410
This isn't mine.

11
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,090
You still recognize me, right?

12
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,450
My brain isn't damaged.

13
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,160
The doctor said...

14
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,880
You consumed a large amount of knockout drug,

15
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,080
you might be temporarily slow to react.

16
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,880
That water pouch was found by Xiao Liuzi.

17
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,280
While you were asleep,

18
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,520
we did some investigating.

19
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,040
It belonged to one of the soldiers escorting the government silver.

20
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,200
The coroner found traces of knockout drug

21
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,440
in the water pouches of the other dead soldiers too.

22
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,960
Inside help and outside forces. What a massive conspiracy.

23
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,720
Sister, Brother Fu just woke up.

24
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,880
You must be hungry. Let's eat first.

25
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:32,600
Okay.

26
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,640
How did they manage to transport such a large amount of silver

27
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,300
from halfway up the mountain?

28
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,600
Always here.

29
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,490
Whenever you're upset, you start carving radishes.

30
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,280
We could fill a cart with all your carved radishes by now.

31
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,600
What's this? Has Miss Yun become stingy?

32
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,880
Now you won't even spare me a radish.

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yes. I don't want you taking your frustrations out on radishes anymore.

34
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,770
Come on. Let's go out for a walk.

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,600
Go.

36
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:19,840
Sis.

37
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,840
Those carefree days when we swung together

38
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,040
seem so long ago.

39
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,460
I really miss how simple and happy things were then.

40
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,620
There's too much going on now.

41
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,060
It's a bit exhausting.

42
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,280
Indeed.

43
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,240
I haven't seen you genuinely smile in days, sis.

44
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,800
Don't put so much pressure on yourself.

45
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,329
After struggling for 10 years,

46
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,560
I still have nothing to show for it.

47
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,690
How can you say that?

48
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,920
You have the estate,

49
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,200
family love, friendship,

50
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,720
and you have us.

51
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,440
Right,

52
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,440
and I have you, little smarty.

53
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,800
Remember when we used to swing here as kids?

54
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,680
We'd swing so high,

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,280
almost flying.

56
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,890
Yes, the hillside position is high enough

57
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,490
that we could easily use a zip line to fly down.

58
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,000
Yun'er, you're brilliant!

59
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,320
You've just solved a major problem for me.

60
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,120
What are you talking about, sis?

61
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,960
Nothing. Sit tight.

62
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,960
I'll push you.

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Come on, sit properly.

64
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,880
Higher!

65
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,960
Higher, sis! Higher!

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,040
A bit higher. No problem.

67
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,400
Coming!

68
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,380
Young Master, you still need to be careful with that wound.

69
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,159
It's fine. About the government silver...

70
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,760
This is all I've found so far.

71
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,720
I'll keep following up on it.

72
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,840
I know how the government silver was transferred.

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,130
Once upon a time, there was a mountain.

74
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,940
On the mountain was a tree.

75
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,880
And on the tree was a zip line.

76
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,490
How did you know?

77
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,100
Fu Dong told me about this.

78
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,140
Taking shortcuts.

79
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,640
I came up with this all by myself.

80
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,560
Right.

81
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,090
Have some water.

82
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,530
So it's harder to trace where the silver went now?

83
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,400
I suppose so.

84
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,650
But the carts carrying the silver are very heavy.

85
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,600
They must leave deep tracks on mountain roads.

86
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,970
I've already arranged people.

87
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,260
They'll inform me when they get news.

88
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,000
I heard your men got the job done.

89
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,360
Can I take charge of that money?

90
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,760
I said no.

91
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,040
This

92
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,770
is a personal letter from Minister He.

93
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,000
I hope you'll reconsider.

94
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,600
If our cooperation turns sour,

95
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,680
this old friend will have to find new ones.

96
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,000
Ten boxes of government silver. That's a lot.

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,530
Can you transport all that?

98
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,140
Money never weighs too heavy.

99
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,640
Of course we can take it.

100
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,210
If things are too hot right now,

101
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,540
I can wait a while before leaving.

102
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:56,890
Don't worry.

103
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,420
I have other channels.

104
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,960
You won't be implicated.

105
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,960
I understand.

106
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,240
You can go now.

107
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,660
Once I've made arrangements,

108
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,640
I'll send someone to notify you.

109
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,800
Then I'll await your good news.

110
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,600
I heard the Emperor wants Lord He, the Imperial Uncle,

111
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,280
to investigate the robbery of government silver.

112
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,600
Lord He made excuses about being old

113
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,000
and in poor health to decline the task.

114
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,360
Is that so?

115
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,850
Two robberies have occurred in Zhongshu City in two months,

116
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,540
and both were successful.

117
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,720
Could this high-ranking official

118
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,120
actually be afraid?

119
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,980
He can't be afraid.

120
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,000
I guess

121
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,560
he's afraid of pulling out more than he bargained for,

122
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,640
that the connections run too deep,

123
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,640
and it might affect his power base at court.

124
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,320
Exactly.

125
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,520
My mentor wrote that the hand behind this case is too powerful.

126
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,440
Such a large sum of money has vanished without a trace,

127
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,380
and no one in the entire court dares to investigate.

128
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,180
He specifically warned me

129
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,810
not to get involved under any circumstances.

130
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,280
This gentleman speaks the truth.

131
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,120
We must remember this

132
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,620
and avoid getting involved at all costs.

133
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,000
Come, let's drink.

134
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,240
Come.

135
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,180
Xiaoliuzi.

136
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,520
Come, eat some food.

137
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,440
Take this to Lord Du. Good.

138
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:33,960
Liuzi.

139
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,480
What's wrong with my sister?

140
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,080
She doesn't seem very happy.

141
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,039
The proprietress often has things on her mind.

142
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:39,770
It's normal.

143
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,480
Let's go.

144
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,240
Fudong, get some chopsticks.

145
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:51,960
No need.

146
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,800
I still have work to finish in the kitchen.

147
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,840
Sit down first.

148
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,160
Food is the first necessity of people.

149
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,520
If the sky falls, the tall ones will hold it up.

150
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,450
What's the rush?

151
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,940
I really have no appetite.

152
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,400
Who has offended my Manager Tian?

153
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,240
Tell me.

154
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,520
I'll help you analyze it.

155
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,640
Fu Mingyang.

156
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,140
I'm really conflicted right now.

157
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,320
If there's something

158
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,600
that you know will cause trouble

159
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,400
if you continue with it,

160
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,200
trouble for you and your family,

161
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,120
would you still stand up

162
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,720
for fairness and justice?
