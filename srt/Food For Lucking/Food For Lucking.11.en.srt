1
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,320
Fifty miles ahead

2
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,900
is the territory of the Central City Patrol.

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,040
Once we get there,

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,400
we can feast on meat

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,460
and drink to our heart's content.

6
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,200
Sir,

7
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,620
all 30,000 taels of government silver are here,

8
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,770
not a penny missing.

9
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,160
Well done.

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,320
How are the other two routes?

11
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,380
Rest assured, sir.

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,640
I've arranged people to assist,

13
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,700
ensuring everything goes smoothly.

14
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,960
Thank you for your hard work.

15
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,760
As for your reward,

16
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,000
collect it from the King of Hell.

17
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,200
Good.

18
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,680
Better lucky than early.

19
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,120
I was planning to discuss business with Master Fu,

20
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,520
not knowing it was Miss Yun'er's birthday.

21
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,280
I happen to have a jade rabbit

22
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,940
to give to Miss Yun'er.

23
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,720
Thank you, Liu.

24
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:51,920
Thank you to the Tian family for taking care of our young master.

25
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,960
These are ruby ruyi earrings

26
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,200
that the old madam entrusted to me,

27
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,280
to be given to Miss Yun'er today.

28
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,200
Happy birthday, Miss Yunr. May you have good fortune.

29
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,400
Thank you, Fu.

30
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,200
I really love it.

31
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,080
I have something to attend to.

32
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,800
Goodbye.

33
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,200
Sister.

34
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,240
Look at this.

35
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,260
Do these earrings look good on me?

36
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,600
Of course you look good, birthday girl.

37
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,840
But Yunr, a young lady should be more reserved.

38
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,120
Don't be so vain.

39
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,400
Reserved?

40
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,480
Sister,

41
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,840
you're just old-fashioned.

42
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,700
You're such a stick-in-the-mud.

43
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,200
Fine, Yunr.

44
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,800
Next year I won't give you anything for your birthday.

45
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,320
Sister, that won't do.

46
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,010
You're our family's purse.

47
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,800
You can't be stingy.

48
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,200
Now you realize that, don't you?

49
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,280
Who let you in?

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You weren't here.

51
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,560
I'm easily exposed outside.

52
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,860
So I invited myself in.

53
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,690
What do you want?

54
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,560
Can't an old friend come by just to visit?

55
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,440
Sure. Tell me what's going on.

56
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,640
To be honest with you,

57
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,880
there's a drought in the north this year.

58
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,210
Our tribal grasslands have barely grown.

59
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,640
Livestock production is severely insufficient.

60
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,440
And our crops have completely failed.

61
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,770
We urgently need money.

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,320
Our king wants to borrow some silver from old friends to get through winter.

63
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,800
Borrow? More like give.

64
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,240
Do you have to be so picky?

65
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,200
Whenever you need us, our king will rally his forces.

66
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,200
We'll help from the inside.

67
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,180
I've already seen.

68
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,400
The women of the Central Plains are very beautiful.

69
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,800
I could take one back as a gift for our king. You wouldn't dare.

70
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,440
You demand money just like that.

71
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,240
Central Plains women are off-limits.

72
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,800
Old friend.

73
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,440
Fine, I won't touch them.

74
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,170
I was just making a little joke.

75
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,020
No need to get so worked up.

76
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,040
I am a foreign envoy.

77
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,640
Get out.

78
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,600
See you later.

79
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,760
Walk straight for 30 minutes after leaving.

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,260
Someone will meet you.

81
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,240
Don't look back.

82
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,360
Don't remove the sack or I'll kill you.

83
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,560
Do you understand?

84
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,640
Go.

85
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,760
Negotiation.

86
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,280
Why are you here again?

87
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,760
Didn't we already pay the ransom?

88
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,360
I need to ask you some questions. I'll kill you if you don't answer.

89
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:38,880
Fine.

90
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,960
Go ahead.

91
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,560
Where did the government silver come from?

92
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,920
My brother's deputy gave it to me.

93
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,980
Where is it hidden?

94
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,560
In the stable at the back.

95
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,120
Is anyone guarding it? No.

96
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,440
Really. Really.

97
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,640
Keep walking forward. Don't look back.

98
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,600
So easy.

99
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,320
Go.

100
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,920
I've seen the military payroll they transported before.

101
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,640
There must have been at least 10 boxes.

102
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,520
25 boxes.

103
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,080
Five of them contained compensation for fallen soldiers.

104
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,240
Last night, the government silver was robbed again while passing through Central City.

105
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,840
All the escorting soldiers were slaughtered.

106
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,560
It happened in that small grove you mentioned.

107
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,050
Fu Dong, you're hiding something from me.

108
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,420
Why won't you let me go?

109
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,840
Speak up.

110
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,680
I said speak!

111
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,280
Young Master, I'm sorry.

112
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,080
What did Master Fu tell you?

113
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,520
Did he say this journey is dangerous?

114
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,040
And that I should mind my own business?

115
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,240
If anything happens,

116
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,360
you must report to my father.

117
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,640
Fu Dong, you are my brother,

118
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,560
not my father's lackey. Do you understand?

119
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,480
Alright.

120
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,080
That's enough.

121
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,360
Fudong is just looking out for you.

122
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,890
She's worried something might happen to you.

123
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,640
Didn't Xiaoliu say?

124
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,560
Many people died at the silver robbery scene.

125
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,600
None of the escort soldiers survived.

126
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,600
Besides, Liu Zhen was there last night.

127
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,640
Could you have escaped?

128
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,560
No survivors.

129
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,530
This was basically a one-sided massacre.

130
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,880
Logically, the escort soldiers shouldn't have been that weak.

131
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,010
I should go to the scene and take a look.

132
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,600
Fudong,

133
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,090
rather than tipping off my father,

134
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,919
you'd better keep a close eye on Commander Qin.

135
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:34,890
Understand?

136
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,720
Get up.

137
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,740
It's alright, Fudong.

138
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,680
Don't take Fumingyang's words to heart.

139
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,560
He has such a bad temper.

140
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,580
Sometimes he's really annoying.

141
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,960
What's between the young master and me

142
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,160
is none of your business as an outsider.

143
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,200
I...

144
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:04,840
You...
