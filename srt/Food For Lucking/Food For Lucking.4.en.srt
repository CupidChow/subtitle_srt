1
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,620
Dinner's ready! Dinner's ready!

2
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,620
Enjoy your meal, guys.

3
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,040
That's it.

4
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,300
This Liu Zhen has gone too far.

5
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,440
First he uses me as his pawn, then makes me his target.

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,840
Do I look like a pushover?

7
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,320
I can't be bothered with him.

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,600
Young Master.

9
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,880
You were reckless just now.

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,140
I was being nice by not hitting him, okay?

11
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,000
And then what?

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,640
Continue being excluded, sidelined, and ignored?

13
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,700
If this continues,

14
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,800
when will we ever complete the task from Prince Ning?

15
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,480
Hey, why are you getting angry now?

16
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,530
Think of something.

17
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,440
How about pretending to give in?

18
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,240
Dream on.

19
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,940
I'll invite Liu Zhen to the entertainment district tomorrow.

20
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:25,960
Young Master.

21
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,080
Where are you going?

22
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,640
Do you want to continue living

23
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,280
with not enough food and poor sleep?

24
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,920
Don't speak. I know you don't want to

25
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,650
come with me.

26
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:52,100
Prepare two of your best rooms for us.

27
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,960
Fu Dong and I will be staying here from now on.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,130
What a spendthrift!

29
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,900
I've already drunk from that.

30
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,760
How many days has it been?

31
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:26,280
Where's the information you promised?

32
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,250
No information.

33
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,360
You're lying.

34
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,800
What I actually said was

35
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,160
let me take office first, then we'll talk.

36
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,570
I never promised you anything.

37
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,560
You're ruthless.

38
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,800
We don't need you.

39
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,600
We can still find the information ourselves.

40
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,320
Xiaoliuzi

41
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,760
Welcome, new tenant.

42
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,650
Let me give you some advice.

43
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,320
Don't mess with Tian Jinjin.

44
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:20,800
So you're saying

45
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,920
we guests should accommodate your landlord?

46
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,800
Lehuo Villa

47
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,960
works exactly this way.

48
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,760
Are you crazy?

49
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,720
Brother, you looking for me?

50
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,770
After Fu Mingyang lost his temper,

51
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,980
did he say anything

52
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,240
or do anything unusual?

53
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,240
No.

54
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,250
I thought he was just a hothead.

55
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,000
Seems he's learned his lesson.

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,930
It's pure luck he came back with only minor injuries.

57
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,520
I'll have someone detain Fu Dong.

58
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,040
No need.

59
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,160
He's still useful to us.

60
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,680
We might catch bigger fish with him.

61
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,760
Fu Mingyang asked me to go to the entertainment bureau tonight.

62
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,160
He must have other plans.

63
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,720
Come with me.

64
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,200
Alright.

65
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,400
Jinjin, we're here to pick up our takeout

66
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,440
Xiaoliuzi.

67
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,620
Go get it. Alright.

68
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,279
It's 12 wen in total,

69
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,130
but I'll just charge you 10.

70
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,290
Liu Zhen isn't here.

71
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,720
Did you get it? Hurry up. I'm starving.

72
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,960
Thank you for your business.

73
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,490
Alright. Let's go, Jinjin.

74
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,400
Master Liu, have a drink with me.

75
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,320
Come on.

76
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,290
Master Fu, I'll drink with you.

77
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,820
What a surprise. We're kindred spirits.

78
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,200
Come on.

79
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,960
Mr. Fu.

80
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,820
Here, let me help you with another drink.

81
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,720
Come on.

82
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,840
Mr. Fu.

83
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,160
Come on, have another glass.

84
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,720
Cheers! Mr. Fu has such a good tolerance.

85
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,760
Mr. Liu, I'm staying here tonight.

86
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,960
Is that okay?

87
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,760
I'll cover all your expenses.

88
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,140
Enjoy yourselves.

89
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,000
Make yourselves at home.

90
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,330
Come on, drink up, have another glass.

91
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,200
Sir.

92
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,210
Fill up Mr. Fu's cup.

93
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,440
Fu Mingyang.

94
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,040
So this is the kind of man you are.

95
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,240
Had I known, I would've found more girls for you.

96
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,370
The owner here is a regular at my place.

97
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,400
He'll surely do me this favor.

98
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:01,930
So annoying.

99
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,480
Mr. Fu finds you irritating.

100
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,480
Please leave now.

101
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,170
You ladies must be tired today.

102
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,000
Why don't you go back and rest early?

103
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,500
I saw you were quite enjoying yourself just now.

104
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,080
What's it to you?

105
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,800
What's a young girl like you doing here?

106
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,760
If you can come here,

107
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,040
why can't I?

108
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,480
You lecher.

109
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,560
Are you even attractive?

110
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,700
I'm not interested in you.

111
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,860
Let me tell you,

112
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,760
I'm here to investigate a case.

113
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,600
Stop talking.

114
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,280
Come back! Explain yourself!

115
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,960
Come, let me tell you.

116
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,130
None of your damn business.

117
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,880
I heard the magistrate has a mistress here.

118
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,290
How did you know?

119
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,520
None of your damn business.

120
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:24,970
Miss Yue'er.

121
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,440
Is Miss Xiaodie here?

122
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,810
The magistrate has something for her.

123
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,610
Impossible.

124
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,600
Xiaodie was the least favored by the magistrate.

125
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,560
Besides, she's already dead.

126
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,960
Then who is the magistrate's mistress?

127
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,520
Why should I tell you?

128
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,650
Because of this.

129
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,680
Get lost.

130
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,760
Ignore him. He's a fool.

131
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,200
Come on, just tell me.

132
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,890
I'm afraid I won't live to spend it.

133
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,880
I'll tell you.

134
00:07:59,320 --> 00:07:59,920
It's Liu.

135
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,140
Where did he go?

136
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,680
He ran away.

137
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,800
Is it Liu or Liu?

138
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,680
Useless.

139
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,080
Xiaoliu.

140
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,600
The prefect has evidence of the stolen government silver.

141
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,240
His death was to silence him.

142
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,480
I'm afraid things might change if we wait.

143
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,040
Let's go to the prefect's house now.

144
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,200
Fine. Take me with you.

145
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,800
I've been waiting forever.

146
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,520
Dangerous.

147
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,040
I know. I'll be careful.

148
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:52,880
Let's go.

149
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,360
Sis, that was so exciting!

150
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,080
Stop fooling around.

151
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,560
Brother Fu.
