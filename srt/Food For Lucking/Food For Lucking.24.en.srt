1
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,360
He Shuhui

2
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:22,920
Fu Mingyang

3
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,760
Mingyang

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,480
Choose one now.

5
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,940
Between these two,

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,060
you can only take one with you.

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,759
As for the other one...

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,000
Shuhui.

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,360
I thought you were just being willful.

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,040
But you're just like your father,

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,120
disregarding others' feelings.

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,840
How am I disregarding your feelings?

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,520
I know you've been looking for them all night.

14
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,320
I sent someone to deliver a message to you first thing this morning.

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,520
Instead of thanking me,

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,580
you're blaming me.

17
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,210
That's not fair, Mingyang.

18
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,530
Hui'er is angry now.

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,680
Stop fooling around.

20
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,160
Are you going to choose or not?

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,520
Do I look like I'm joking?

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,160
Don't worry about me.

23
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,800
Save Yun'er.

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,520
Not choosing?

25
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,760
Then I'll kill both of them. Wait.

26
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,360
I'm serious.

27
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,880
Will you make a choice or not?

28
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,200
Tian Jinjin.

29
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,720
I choose Tian Jinjin.

30
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,200
No.

31
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,240
Don't.

32
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:38,880
Stop.

33
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:39,960
It seems

34
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,000
your opinions are not quite unified.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,960
How about this?

36
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,840
Do you want to return to the capital with me to get married

37
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,039
or would you prefer I kill her right now?

38
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,640
Three.

39
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,920
I'll marry you.

40
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,840
How boring.

41
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,820
A man who only has another woman in his heart.

42
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,810
I don't want him.

43
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,040
You can go.

44
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,400
Are you okay?

45
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,280
You're really letting us go?

46
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,530
Don't be surprised.

47
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,079
This was just a game.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,120
I accept my loss.

49
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,060
Both of you, leave now.

50
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,060
Don't stay here and bother me.

51
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,200
Are you okay?

52
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,280
Young Master.

53
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,240
You all go through the back first.

54
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,900
None of you will escape today.

55
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,360
Young Master, hurry!

56
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,720
Tian Ruoshui, daughter of the rebel general.

57
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,440
Today you'll all die here.

58
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,280
Jinjin!

59
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,960
Jinjin!

60
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,840
That's Minister He's daughter.

61
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,780
Attention, soldiers!

62
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,760
Commander Qin has committed insubordination

63
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,960
and stolen government silver.

64
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,280
He shall be executed immediately.

65
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,280
Those who followed him unknowingly will be pardoned.

66
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,520
Now go!

67
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,680
Thank you, sir. Let's go.

68
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,120
Don't cry, sister.

69
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,960
Sister loves you.

70
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,040
Sister, I'm sorry.

71
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,880
I'm sorry.

72
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,560
Sister.

73
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,720
No!

74
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,920
I'm going to the capital.

75
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,760
The post station is yours from now on.

76
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,020
Don't worry, brother.

77
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,200
You're really leaving?

78
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,840
Yes, I am.

79
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,860
All my life, I've been forced by circumstances.

80
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,880
I've always followed the path others set for me.

81
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,920
This time, I want to be myself.

82
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,320
Let's go, Liu.

83
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,970
Let's return to the capital together.

84
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,060
If you want to stay, I won't force you.

85
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,610
It won't be long anyway.

86
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,240
You'll come to me on your own.

87
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,450
Until we meet again. Take care.

88
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,520
Take care.

89
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,440
You all.

90
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,280
Yun'er.

91
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,170
Where are you going?

92
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,200
We're family.

93
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,170
If you want to leave,

94
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,920
we'll all go together.

95
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,640
Yun'er.

96
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,360
I won't scold you anymore.

97
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,480
I'll give you more pocket money from now on, okay?

98
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,320
Yes, from now on, climbing trees, picking flowers, making dough, boiling water,

99
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,120
I'll do it all.

100
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,840
I'll give you snacks too.

101
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,120
And if you make terrible pastries in the future,

102
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,320
I won't criticize you.

103
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,050
I won't charge you rent either.

104
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,610
Please, Yun'er.

105
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:37,880
It's okay.

106
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,840
Everything is over now, alright?

107
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,280
Sister, I'm sorry.

108
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm sorry.

109
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,680
It's okay.

110
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,580
Remember this.

111
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,920
You'll always be my dear sister.

112
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,360
Always that kind and lovely Yun'er.

113
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,680
So touching.

114
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,520
I miss home too.

115
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,210
Let's go home and make dumplings then.

116
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,320
Let's go home now.

117
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,480
Let's go.

118
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,880
It's my greatest happiness that you enjoy the food I cook.

119
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,400
It's just food.

120
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,880
I knew you only cared about the food.

121
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,090
That's not true.

122
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,410
I also fell in love with you.

123
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,080
Since I met you,

124
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,180
I've had nothing but bad luck.

125
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,440
But since I fell in love with you,

126
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,100
I realized that sharing life's ups and downs

127
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,640
is also a kind of happiness.

128
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,440
But you are my greatest fortune.

129
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,850
What a beautiful scene.

130
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,930
It makes me want to fall in love too.

131
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,920
Yun'er, why don't we give it a try?

132
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,640
Get lost!

133
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,480
My sister is so easy to please.

134
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,140
We must ask for a bigger dowry.

135
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,160
I never would have guessed

136
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,640
that Manager Tian had such a feminine side.

137
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,440
Young master.

138
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,460
In a normal storyline,

139
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,280
when Fu Dong appears at this moment, it means trouble.

140
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,720
There's trouble at the border. An urgent message.

141
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,780
You're summoned back to the capital.

142
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,559
I have to go.

143
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,280
I understand.

144
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,100
Go quickly.

145
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,240
Young master, it's time to leave.

146
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,290
Brother Fu, remember to come back and visit us often.

147
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,720
Alright,

148
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,760
hurry up and go.

149
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,160
I need to go back and cook.

150
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,890
I'm leaving now.

151
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,240
The wise stay away from love.

152
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,840
Fudong.

153
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,370
Go back by yourself.

154
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,260
I'm not going back yet.

155
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,770
I'll explain to Prince Ning alone.

156
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,440
I can't let go of Tian Jinjin.

157
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,600
I'm leaving.

158
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,570
Tian Jinjin.

159
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,200
Jinjin.

160
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,840
Didn't you leave?

161
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,920
Why did you come back?

162
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,240
I'm sorry, I...

163
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,320
I lost something.

164
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,240
What did you lose?

165
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:41,960
Jinjin.

166
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,160
Jinjin.

167
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:51,880
It's you.

168
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,200
I...

169
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,240
I'm hungry.
