1
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,560
Mother got frightened last night.

2
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,320
Let's buy some ingredients and fruits.

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,000
We'll make her a nourishing soup when we get back.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Stop right there.

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,560
Manager Tian, come with us.

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,650
Commander Qin has some questions for you.

7
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:33,080
Sister.

8
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,400
Yun'er, go home first and prepare mother's medicine.

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,480
I'll be back soon.

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,160
It's alright.

11
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,120
Sister.

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,370
About my brother at the casino.

13
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,700
You set him up, didn't you?

14
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,280
Let's be straightforward with each other.

15
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,810
I'll get right to the point.

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,280
Tell me where the government silver is.

17
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,210
And I'll let you go home.

18
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,250
What silver are you talking about?

19
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,500
Commander Qin.

20
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,200
I don't understand a word you're saying.

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,760
I'm just a little cook.

22
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:16,560
I only know eggplants, green beans, and daylily buds.

23
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,920
Playing tough, are you? Fine.

24
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,410
I'll keep you locked up until you talk.

25
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,520
Yun'er.

26
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,920
I'll ask Xiao Liu to find out what's happening.

27
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,680
It can't be that serious.

28
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,400
Otherwise they wouldn't have just arrested your sister.

29
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,600
They would have taken our whole family.

30
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,320
Go wash your face.

31
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,460
Your sister will worry if she sees you like this.

32
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,400
Yun'er, listen to me.

33
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,240
No matter how big the problem is, I'm here.

34
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,840
I'll find someone to help us.

35
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,260
Do you understand?

36
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,920
Help. We need to ask Brother Fu for help.

37
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,800
Commander Qin.

38
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,079
Government silver, gambling den, foreign land, cabin.

39
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,079
I see.

40
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,680
Meal time! Meal time!

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,200
Meal time! Meal time!

42
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,120
Brother, where's my food?

43
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,360
There's none for you.

44
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,890
Orders from above. You only get one meal a day.

45
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,160
Meal time!

46
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,440
Meal time!

47
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,930
They want to starve me to death.

48
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,120
Fudong.

49
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,440
Where is Brother Fu?

50
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,400
He's not here.

51
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,040
When will he be back?

52
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,130
I don't know.

53
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,160
Why aren't you with him?

54
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,680
The young master told me to stay here and reflect on my mistakes.

55
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,440
Tell him to go to Lehuo Manor right away.

56
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,120
Something happened to my sister.

57
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,320
Something happened?

58
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,210
Miss Yun'er.

59
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,800
Who's the fool that dared to bully our Miss Yun'er?

60
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,160
My sister was taken away by the patrol guards.

61
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,540
What happened?

62
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,520
I don't know who she offended.

63
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,320
There, there. Don't cry.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,520
I'll go ask about it later.

65
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,240
It's okay. Don't cry.

66
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,340
Go home and wait for my news, alright?

67
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:33,690
Let's go.

68
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,620
Everyone says politics is complicated.

69
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,140
It was more fun fighting enemies at the border with you all.

70
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,840
Stop looking.

71
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,480
There's no one else but me.

72
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,180
Where did everyone go?

73
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,760
Why are you alone?

74
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,180
Come drink with me.

75
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,040
What are you doing?

76
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,900
I didn't expect

77
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,480
you'd have such prejudice against Jinjin.

78
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,690
She's been imprisoned.

79
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,930
Imprisoned?

80
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,400
Why?

81
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,640
Go ask Tian Yuner yourself.

82
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,370
She should be waiting for you at the post station.

83
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,280
Sir,

84
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,200
did you see

85
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,130
a girl named Tian Jinjin brought in this morning?

86
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,080
Yes.

87
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,060
Who are you?

88
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,480
I'm her friend.

89
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,720
So?

90
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,040
Could you please go in and check on her?

91
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,320
Go away.

92
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,080
This is a restricted area.

93
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,409
Go play somewhere else.

94
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,560
It's fine. I'll go in and see for myself.

95
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,240
Go away. Get lost.

96
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,800
You dare to barge in anywhere.

97
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,240
I just want to take a look inside.

98
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,520
Move again and I'll draw my sword.

99
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:53,800
Sir.

100
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:56,290
Fu Mingyang himself isn't that scary.

101
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,920
It's just that his father is a second-rank official in the court.

102
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,000
You see, what is there to fear?

103
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,040
Kill him. Yes.

104
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,200
Father, Mother.

105
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,120
I have failed you.

106
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,560
I must depart before avenging our family.

107
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,580
In my next life,

108
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,520
I'll be your daughter again.

109
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,300
I promise to protect you completely.

110
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,040
Officer Qin.

111
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,810
I really didn't steal any government silver.

112
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,440
I'm just an ordinary citizen.

113
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,260
I didn't do anything. Please believe me.

114
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,200
I have something here.

115
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,320
A jade pendant bestowed by the Emperor himself.

116
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,040
Take a look.

117
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,480
It's real.

118
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,680
I'm going to be the princess of the Park family.

119
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,400
Please let me go.

120
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,680
Move.

121
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,220
Why are you here again?

122
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,320
Got any rooms available?

123
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,680
Are you crazy?

124
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,940
Being nice doesn't work, does it?

125
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,050
What do you want?

126
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,290
Fu Mingyang.

127
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,940
How did you get in here?

128
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,210
Isn't it quite dark in here?

129
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,940
Aren't you afraid of the dark?

130
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,900
Why did you really come in?

131
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,000
Why did I come in?

132
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,730
What am I doing here?

133
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,360
I came in... I...

134
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,600
I came in.

135
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,360
I...

136
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,520
I just want to protect you.
