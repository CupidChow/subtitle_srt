1
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,200
Catch them dead or alive! Help!

2
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,440
Fu Mingyang

3
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,840
Who is this guy?

4
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,690
What are you doing here?

5
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,760
I was about to ask you the same thing.

6
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,760
Go save my sister.

7
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,120
Beg me.

8
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,800
Wait! Please!

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,000
When will big sister come to save us?

10
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,840
This is all your fault.

11
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,840
Come on. Join me for a drink.

12
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,959
You stink! Let me go! She's just a little girl!

13
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:05,890
Got lucky there.

14
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,440
Brother Fu

15
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,840
Behave yourself.

16
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,450
If you want to cry, do it at home.

17
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,370
Fine. Let's go home.

18
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,320
Where did this money come from?

19
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,880
Put it down. It's a burden.

20
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,250
But there are more than 10 silver ingots my sister stole.

21
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,920
Your sister is something else.

22
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,600
Brother Fu

23
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,620
Don't forget about me.

24
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,680
Liuzi

25
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,660
Where is Young Master Qin?

26
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,650
Impressive.

27
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,250
Brother Fu, wait for me!

28
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,440
Brother Fu, my leg hurts.

29
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,480
Liuzi

30
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,079
Brother Fu, an injured person carrying another injured person.

31
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,940
Do you think that's appropriate?

32
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,640
Appropriate? Absolutely appropriate.

33
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,440
So handsome!

34
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,880
Yun'er, you must be okay.

35
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,370
You must be alright.

36
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,579
If my young master is safe,

37
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,620
then your sister will be safe too.

38
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:53,210
Can Fu Mingyang really rescue Yun'er?

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,480
No way.

40
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,560
I still need to check on her.

41
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,920
Tian Jinjin, stop being so stubborn.

42
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,760
Will you?

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,720
You've dragged my young master into trouble before.

44
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,440
Now even your sister is caught up in this mess.

45
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,770
When will you ever stop?

46
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,360
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,160
I was too full of myself.

48
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,000
Good at ruining things but useless at achieving anything.

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,200
If you hadn't interfered at the casino,

50
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,000
we would have brought Young Master Qin back already.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,600
I know.

52
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,520
It's all my fault.

53
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,400
Weren't you quite good at talking back before?

54
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,940
Why the sudden change now?

55
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,360
I used to live too selfishly.

56
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,010
Rarely thinking about others.

57
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,760
I've let down Mother and Yun'er.

58
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,640
They've been so good to me.

59
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,840
Given me everything.

60
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,560
I had no way to repay them.

61
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,120
And now I've even lost my sister.

62
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,480
Young Master.

63
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:55,960
Yun'er.

64
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,529
Tell Fu Mingyang to be careful.

65
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,020
Many people want him dead.

66
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,920
He can't die too soon.

67
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,580
No matter who it is,

68
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,360
anyone who harms the Young Master dies.

69
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,850
You had your mother so worried.

70
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,520
How could a young lady like you enter a gambling house?

71
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,840
It's good that you've returned safely.

72
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,880
Nothing else matters.

73
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,680
The sisters know their limits, yes.

74
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,000
Lord Pu is right.

75
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,730
It's good to be back safely.

76
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,800
Thank you, Lord Fu, for saving my life.

77
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,760
It's no big deal, right, Fudong?

78
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,240
Yes, no need to thank me for such kindness.

79
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,040
Today's meal is just my way of returning the favor.

80
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,100
Brother Fu, thank you for saving my life.

81
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,660
Yun'er will drink first to show respect.

82
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,280
For saving a life, how can one drink be enough?

83
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,010
Isn't it customary to offer oneself in marriage?

84
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,200
No talking while eating. Hurry up and eat.

85
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,860
You still have a task tonight.

86
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:34,970
Fu Mingyang.

87
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,080
I'll show you something later, okay?

88
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,320
Yun'er, this is your favorite food.

89
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,800
Jinjin, you're here.

90
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,720
Look at the corners of this paper.

91
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,480
They have the characters for 'three people' and 'wood' written separately.

92
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,040
When you combine these strokes together,

93
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,040
it should form the character 'Qin'.

94
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,410
Any other discoveries?

95
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,680
Could the postal guard mentioned here be your predecessor who left for mourning?

96
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,440
He and the assassinated prefect were from the same hometown.

97
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,800
And he disappeared half a day before the prefect.

98
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,060
Officially he left to mourn his parents, but according to my investigation,

99
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,440
he never returned to his hometown.

100
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,170
Instead, he vanished without a trace in the city.

101
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,200
Then he might have met with misfortune,

102
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,080
or perhaps he received some information and went into hiding.

103
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,320
I found bloodstains on his bed.

104
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,760
Xiao Ding also found

105
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,400
a torn fingernail in his bedding.

106
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,659
All evidence suggests

107
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,520
the former postal guard has likely met a tragic end.

108
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,600
I'm going to infiltrate the patrol camp tonight.

109
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,860
The patrol camp's strength shouldn't be underestimated.

110
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,400
Don't worry. I'm not weak either.

111
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,960
Fire prevention, theft prevention.

112
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,320
We're rich! We're rich!

113
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,360
Money is falling from the sky!

114
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,560
We're rich! We're rich!

115
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,840
Sister, I noticed you barely ate dinner.

116
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,300
You must be hungry now.

117
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,120
Coming out so late at night.

118
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,160
Actually, I'm worried about Brother Fu.

119
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,370
Why worry about him?

120
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,520
His martial arts skills are strong.

121
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,960
He came to rescue me all alone that day.

122
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,250
Like a god descending from heaven.

123
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,720
So brave, handsome and charming.

124
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,640
Oh, you.

125
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,000
Don't be fooled by his appearance.

126
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,440
These young masters are known for attracting girls.

127
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,960
Are there many who like him?

128
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,400
Actually, I used to dislike him.

129
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,320
You don't know who I ran into at the entertainment district last time.

130
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,380
What's that noise?

131
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,400
Fu Mingyang! Brother Fu!

132
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,520
You're hurt. Are you okay?

133
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,770
Are you alright?

134
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,040
Fu Dong.

135
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,020
How could you let him get hurt?

136
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,980
It's not her fault.

137
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,800
I could have dodged that arrow.

138
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,520
But unexpectedly, the young master... it's fine.

139
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,120
He took the hit for me. It's nothing.

140
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,980
One showing off, one useless.

141
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,040
Quickly, get inside to treat the wound. Go.

142
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,600
Sister.

143
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,560
A squad of soldiers is coming from the main road.

144
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,240
What?

145
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,760
Fu Dong, let's go.

146
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,240
Fu Mingyang! Brother Fu!

147
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,960
People of the jianghu never abandon those in need.

148
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,090
Xiao Liuzi, go stall them for a moment.

149
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,320
Thank you, Manager Tian.

150
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,040
Say no more. Let's go.
