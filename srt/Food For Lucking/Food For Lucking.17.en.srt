1
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,080
This jade saved your life.

2
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,200
Who gave it to you?

3
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,480
Pu Daoyi.

4
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,560
Who?

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,720
The landlord.

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,560
The one from your estate.

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,250
Return it to him.

8
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,960
Why? Don't you like jade pendants?

9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,440
I prefer kitchen knives.

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,920
But I quite like it.

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,300
It's so beautiful.

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,540
Put it away.

13
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,810
I'll get you a new one next time.

14
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,690
Why would you want to give me gifts?

15
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,800
I have a grudge against him, okay?

16
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,720
Anyway, no matter what,

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,120
no other men are allowed to give you gifts from now on.

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,080
Only I can give you presents.

19
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:00,960
Do you understand?

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,840
What grudge do you have against him?

21
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,680
I don't know anything about it.

22
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,440
Why can't other men give me gifts?

23
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,600
Why should I only accept things from you?

24
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,660
Because I like you.

25
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,289
Young Master, what's going on?

26
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,720
Young Master.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,930
Why are you here?

28
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,740
Fudong is here to keep Young Master company.

29
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,130
Fudong, this place is a prison.

30
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,440
I don't need your company.

31
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,170
Understand?

32
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,610
I want to share your hardships, Young Master.

33
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,360
What a loyal female bodyguard.

34
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,120
Yun'er.

35
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,760
Why don't we close the business?

36
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,600
No way.

37
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,000
Even if my sister isn't here,

38
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,410
I can still manage the estate well.

39
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,340
Mother will stay with you.

40
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,260
Let's work.

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,840
Don't cry.

42
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,040
Come.

43
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,360
Stay away from me.

44
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,680
You already have that loyal female guard by your side.

45
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,410
You're jealous.

46
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,240
Get lost.

47
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,130
Fu Mingyang.

48
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,720
If you stay with me,

49
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,180
you might get implicated.

50
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,980
They don't have any evidence.

51
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,890
They won't convict you easily.

52
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,440
But I have a secret.

53
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,420
Listen carefully.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,600
Tell me.

55
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,360
My real name is Tian Ruoshui.

56
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,850
I am Tian Buwei's daughter.

57
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,660
If you stay with me,

58
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,640
you'll be charged with treason.

59
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:18,880
Jinjin.

60
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,280
I don't care who you are.

61
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,480
I love you.

62
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,159
Commander Qin, your dishes.

63
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,850
Young Master Qin, enjoy your meal.

64
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,040
This is too salty.

65
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,500
Get the cook for me.

66
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:07,880
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,240
I accidentally added salt twice.

68
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,080
Miss, are you an angel?

69
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,400
This dish is delicious.

70
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,730
Right, brother?

71
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,680
If you like it,

72
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,260
you can have it all.

73
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,320
Young Master Qin, please eat more if you enjoy the food.

74
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,600
Yun'er.

75
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,480
Listen to me, Yun'er.

76
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,560
Mother, please go home.

77
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,460
I'll wait here for Brother Fu.

78
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,840
He needs my help with the investigation.

79
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,640
He won't stand by and do nothing.

80
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,920
But...

81
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,760
Mother, I'm anxious.

82
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,960
I know. I understand everything.

83
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,260
Mother, please go home first.

84
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,720
Miss Yun'er.

85
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,500
Why are you crying?

86
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,880
Tell me if you have any troubles.

87
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,360
My brother is the commander of the patrol division.

88
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,600
He can definitely help you.

89
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,000
Let's go find my brother.

90
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,280
Let's go.

91
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,480
You need to drink too.

92
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,360
Young Master Qin.

93
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,880
Please help save my sister.

94
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,200
Miss Yun'er, please get up.

95
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,640
Let's talk properly.

96
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,560
Come.

97
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,400
What happened?

98
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,720
My sister has been imprisoned in the patrol garrison jail.

99
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,850
Please help rescue her, young master.

100
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,840
I can.

101
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,040
But you must spend the night with me.

102
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,600
Fu Dong.

103
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,400
Take my fish token and send a message to the Prince by carrier pigeon.

104
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,200
Young Master.

105
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,840
I've already sent a message by carrier pigeon before coming in.

106
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,370
Prince Ning should be negotiating right now.

107
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,440
He's weighing his options, I suppose.

108
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,370
I'm a dignified border commander,

109
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,540
yet retrieving my soldiers' rightful wages has become so difficult.

110
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,330
Now I have to sneak around like a thief.

111
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,840
It's humiliating.

112
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,860
What's the point of being an official if I can't make a difference?

113
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,730
Fu Mingyang,

114
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,840
don't be rash.

115
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,120
Today I will be rash.

116
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm not afraid to die in battle.

117
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,320
What I fear is living with all these political schemes.

118
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,520
Tell the Prince to replace me.

119
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,980
Fine, let him replace you.

120
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,720
Do you realize what time it is?

121
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,840
You're still throwing tantrums like a spoiled young master.

122
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,100
If you resign now, there's no way you'll escape unscathed.

123
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,160
Master Qin.

124
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,480
Can you really rescue my sister?

125
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,280
Go downstairs first.

126
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,440
Sister Yun'er.

127
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,400
Don't worry.

128
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,880
I'll take care of it.
