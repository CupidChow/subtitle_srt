1
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,080
Jinjin.

2
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,680
Jinjin.

3
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,680
What?

4
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,880
I came to ask

5
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,580
if you're feeling better.

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:31,920
I'm fine.

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,900
Why aren't you at work?

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,280
Why did you come back?

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,360
I...

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,260
Commander Qin's brother was killed.

11
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,200
They asked me to tell you

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,010
not to go out these days.

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,140
You might get implicated.

14
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,680
Okay, I understand.

15
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,600
Let's not see each other for a few days.

16
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,860
I need to think clearly about our relationship.

17
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,680
Our relationship is very clear.

18
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,319
It's just that...

19
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,800
You like me.

20
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,260
And then...

21
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,240
I like you too.

22
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,680
I need to think about it more.

23
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,660
Are you trying to back out?

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,920
Young master, lunch is ready.

25
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,810
I'm not eating. I'm not hungry.

26
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,380
Let's go to Lehuo Manor for lunch.

27
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,920
If there's any misunderstanding, open up to Manager Tian

28
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,050
and have a good talk.

29
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,970
There's nothing that can't be solved over a meal.

30
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,840
If that doesn't work,

31
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,800
go buy a gift.

32
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,380
That's a good idea.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,400
Come with me to buy a gift.

34
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,610
Which one looks better?

35
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,280
Really?

36
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,460
Looks good.

37
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,320
Really?

38
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,720
Jinjin will definitely like it.

39
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,320
Pay up.

40
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,560
Xiang'er.

41
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:47,920
Do you think I look good in this outfit?

42
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,560
Will Yang like it?

43
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,560
Miss, you are Lord He's precious daughter.

44
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,560
A noble lady of royal descent.

45
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,560
Favored by the Empress herself.

46
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,220
Even the princes yield to you.

47
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,900
How could Lord Fu not like you?

48
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,160
Don't say that.

49
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,320
Yang and I grew up together.

50
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,040
I know his temperament better than anyone.

51
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,810
He responds to gentleness, not force.

52
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,720
By this hour,

53
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,810
we should be arriving soon.

54
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,519
Miss,

55
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,600
don't be anxious.

56
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,720
You've checked several times already.

57
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,120
We'll be there very soon.

58
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:26,960
Let's go.

59
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,120
Jinjin.

60
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,840
You can tell me if you have any problems.

61
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,280
I understand you.

62
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,690
What do you understand?

63
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,690
If I don't understand, you can tell me.

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,260
I bought you a hairpin.

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,800
Do you like it?

66
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,850
Fu Mingyang.

67
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,680
You deserve a better girl.

68
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,720
I just think you're the best.

69
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,530
You're better than better.

70
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,500
This hairpin is so beautiful.

71
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,640
Can you give it to me? No.

72
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:34,880
Yes.

73
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,940
Since it's given to me,

74
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,980
I can decide what to do with it.

75
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,280
Why are you causing trouble?

76
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,400
So annoying.

77
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,400
Jinjin.

78
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,480
Jinjin.

79
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,440
Jinjin.

80
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,160
Lord Pu.

81
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,240
Thank you for your jade pendant.

82
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,900
You keep it.

83
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,440
It might be useful someday.

84
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,500
It's too valuable.

85
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,400
I can't afford to lose it.

86
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,800
If necessary,

87
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,970
I'll come borrow it from you, okay?

88
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,360
Jinjin.

89
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,360
Are you giving up on Fu Mingyang?

90
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,980
He can't bear to let you go.

91
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,600
What nonsense are you talking about?

92
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,640
We're sworn enemies.

93
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,280
I've even attacked him with a knife.

94
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,260
You attack him and he doesn't even get angry.

95
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,940
He's clearly head over heels for you.

96
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,370
Finding someone who loves you isn't easy.

97
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,740
You should cherish it.

98
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:57,080
But I don't think our feelings are that deep yet.

99
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,960
You can't just look at people with your eyes.

100
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,420
You need to use your heart.

101
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,720
But Yun'er likes him too.

102
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,600
A lover isn't a dessert.

103
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,880
You can't just pass them around.

104
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,080
Why am I telling you all this?

105
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,200
Let's drop it.

106
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,440
I'm going to cook now.

107
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,680
A bickering couple.

108
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,880
What a pair they make.

109
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,440
It's just a shame these pastries are so delicious.

110
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,170
We can't give one piece to each person.

111
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,120
What's going on?

112
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,400
He hasn't left his room for two days.

113
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,159
The young master is injured.

114
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,780
Injured again?

115
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,400
Heartbroken. You wouldn't understand.

116
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,050
I'll go check on him.

117
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,610
The young master said no one is allowed in.

118
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,159
He's hurt and I have medicine.

119
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,580
You don't understand.

120
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,720
Mr. Fu, don't bother me.

121
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,640
Mr. Fu, why are you so angry?

122
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,320
Get out.

123
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,720
The key Tian Yuner copied is fake.

124
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,370
The real one is here.

125
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,640
I know. You can go now.

126
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,920
Haven't you been looking for the treasury key?

127
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,700
That doesn't matter anymore.

128
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,440
Do you know

129
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,480
how to win back a girl's heart?

130
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,560
You've got it bad.

131
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,160
I don't know how to win back a girl's heart.

132
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,180
Friendly Reminder

133
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,650
Find out what matters most to this girl

134
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,480
and appeal to her interests.

135
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,920
Be sincere.

136
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,640
Don't waste the food.

137
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,200
What does he mean by 'sincere'?

138
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,800
Sincere.

139
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,640
Extremely sincere.

140
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,850
Fu Mingyang.

141
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,740
Why are you looking for me?

142
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,320
Dear Ms. Tian,

143
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,800
Today,

144
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,840
I would like to sincerely invite you

145
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,920
to meet someone important.

146
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,400
Who?

147
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,760
Someone who is very important to you,

148
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,720
whether in the past,

149
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,880
present, or future.

150
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,280
Meeting your parents already?

151
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,250
I'm not even prepared for that.

152
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,480
Why so mysterious?

153
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,140
Can't you just tell me?

154
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,000
Follow me upstairs and you'll see.

155
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,800
Brother Yang.

156
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,760
He Shuhui.

157
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,440
What are you doing here?

158
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,720
Who is she?

159
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,280
Don't tell me she likes Brother Yang too.

160
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,040
Brother Yang.

161
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,000
What the hell?

162
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,480
Those two.

163
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,920
Fu Mingyang, you bastard.

164
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,240
Look at her sallow skin.

165
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,280
I don't know where she gets the nerve.

166
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,680
She can't compare to me in any way.

167
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,040
What are you looking at?

168
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,680
Small eyes and flat nose.

169
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,120
Her maid doesn't look that great either.

170
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,580
At least I have Xiaoliuzi.

171
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,080
Fu Mingyang.

172
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,960
Is this who you wanted me to meet?

173
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,040
Not exactly.

174
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,360
Hello.

175
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,000
You're not bad yourself.

176
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,400
Jin.
