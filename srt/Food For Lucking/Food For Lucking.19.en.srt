1
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:22,960
Yun'er.

2
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,050
What's wrong? Your hands are all red from scrubbing.

3
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,200
They're dirty. I need to wash them properly.

4
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,080
So I can cook.

5
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,240
Stop washing, Sister Jinjin.

6
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,600
I'll order food for Mr. Liu.

7
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,560
Coming!

8
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,600
The usual - four dishes, one soup, and a bowl of noodles.

9
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,200
Right?

10
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,930
You have such a good memory.

11
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,640
Here's the money.

12
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,080
I found this in the bedding of the previous post guard.

13
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,440
Take care. Come again. Sure!

14
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,640
This key has such a unique shape.

15
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,330
I think I've seen it somewhere before.

16
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,860
I believe Station Master Liu has one on his belt.

17
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,410
Are you sure?

18
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:36,360
Yes, I'm sure. That's great!

19
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,860
Then I'll find a way to steal it tomorrow.

20
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,880
Good night.

21
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,820
Yun'er, could you help your sister with something?

22
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,120
I don't feel well. Don't want to move.

23
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,050
I don't want to do anything.

24
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,640
What's wrong with you?

25
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,800
Where does it hurt?

26
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,160
It's nothing.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,160
My dear Yun'er.

28
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,760
Please help your sister.

29
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,760
This matter is very important to me.

30
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,040
I promise

31
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,570
I'll do anything you need in the future without hesitation.

32
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:43,880
Alright.

33
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,840
Then agree to one condition for me.

34
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,520
No problem.

35
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,410
Not just one, I'll agree to ten.

36
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,180
It's a deal.

37
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,280
It's a deal.

38
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,360
Manager Tian, what brings you here?

39
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,000
The Mid-Autumn Festival is coming soon.

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,730
Our manor has

41
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,200
launched several different flavored multigrain mooncakes.

42
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,000
And we have homemade osmanthus wine too.

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,060
I brought some for everyone to taste. What do you think?

44
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,140
We love Miss Yun'er's pastries the most.

45
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,610
What a rare visitor!

46
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,360
Today is a good day.

47
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,200
Quick, tell the staff to prepare some special dishes.

48
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,680
And slaughter two chickens.

49
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,200
Tonight we must taste the flavors of Lehuo Manor.

50
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,960
It's absolutely heavenly.

51
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,640
So intoxicating you'll forget your way home.

52
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,440
Isn't that right, Manager Tian?

53
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,280
Let's go.

54
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,400
Alright.

55
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,040
Miss Yun'er, are you tired from dancing?

56
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,240
Sit down and have a drink.

57
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,960
No, thanks.

58
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,540
Am I that frightening?

59
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
I don't bite.

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,120
Sir Liu, you are a bit intimidating when you're not smiling.

61
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,380
Let me pour you a drink.

62
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,760
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,040
It's fine.

64
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,200
I know you didn't mean it.

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,460
I'll go change my clothes.

66
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,240
Sir Liu, I'm truly sorry.

67
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,280
Yes?

68
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,680
Sir Fu.

69
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,040
Are you drunk?

70
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,280
The restroom is that way.

71
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,720
My back hurts.

72
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,840
I want to walk around.

73
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,920
Manager Tian.

74
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,640
The pre-festival inspection at the post station is quite dangerous.

75
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,240
It's safer for everyone to stay where they are.

76
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,280
Come on, let's drink.

77
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,960
Yun'er, you're amazing.

78
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,640
You've been a great help to me.

79
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,640
Then will you agree to my condition?

80
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,130
Can you do it? Of course.

81
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,720
What condition? Tell me.

82
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,600
I like Brother Fu.

83
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,980
Please give us your blessing.

84
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,280
Have you told him how you feel?

85
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,320
If he accepts you,

86
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,370
I have no objection.

87
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,320
I know you also have feelings for Brother Fu.

88
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,680
That's why I want your blessing.

89
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,280
I see.

90
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,080
For a man,

91
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,400
why bother, Yun'er?

92
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,040
If you two are in love,

93
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,480
I'll step aside.

94
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,340
Is this still about the key incident?

95
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,560
What about me?

96
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,460
It's because of you

97
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,000
that things got worse.

98
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,600
No, I didn't do anything to upset you.

99
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,220
Taking your anger out on that carrot.

100
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,280
Your boning knife skills are good.

101
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:44,960
Very thin.

102
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,760
No matter how thin, it's not as thin as some people's hearts.

103
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,640
Wow, you're really angry.

104
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,680
Come on, don't be mad.

105
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,240
It's all my fault.

106
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,120
I apologize, okay?

107
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,440
Let me calm down.

108
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,570
Don't follow me.

109
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,160
Jinjin.

110
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,159
Yun'er, your sister hasn't eaten dinner.

111
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,179
What's wrong with her?

112
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,240
She might be a bit upset.

113
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,960
I told her I like Fu.

114
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,210
I hope she'll give us her blessing.

115
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,360
How could you do this?

116
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,120
They're in love with each other.

117
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,620
I haven't wronged her.

118
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,680
What right does she have?

119
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,160
I saved her life, Yun'er.

120
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,520
She promised to give me the best she could.

121
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,640
I don't want the best.

122
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,170
I only want Fu Mingyang.

123
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,640
Yun'er, Mr. Fu doesn't have feelings for you.

124
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,600
If my sister disappears,

125
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,460
Fu will naturally see my good qualities.

126
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,400
Maybe he'll love me for her sake.

127
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,280
Yun'er, please don't do anything foolish.

128
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,560
Yun'er.

129
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,120
They forced me.

130
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,600
My sister is too selfish.

131
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,840
I lost everything to save her,

132
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,120
and now she wants to take away the man I love.

133
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,600
It's all her fault.

134
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,840
Yun'er, please don't do anything foolish.

135
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,240
Yun'er, listen to your mother.
