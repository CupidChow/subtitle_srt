1
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,320
You clearly know that if you continue with this,

2
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,320
it could very likely cause trouble

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,280
for you and your family.

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,760
Would you still fight for fairness and justice

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,000
until the very end?

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:27,760
I will.

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,080
I hope my family will support me.

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,920
If they don't agree,

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,690
I hope they can stay away from harm.

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,290
Come, Manager Tian.

11
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,480
Don't overthink it.

12
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,480
You still have me.

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,440
Eat up.

14
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,599
Young master, you two eat.

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,240
I'm full.

16
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,160
Go ahead.

17
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,010
Fu Mingyang.

18
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:15,480
Come find me in half an hour.

19
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,760
I'll make you lucky lotus root.

20
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,120
Since you've been in Central City,

21
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,380
you keep getting hurt.

22
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,200
You need to learn to use food to change your luck

23
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,120
and bring continuous good fortune.

24
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,760
Alright, I'll listen to you.

25
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,460
I'll be going then.

26
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,240
So much money.

27
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,199
All this silver.

28
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,680
Enough for our entire tribe to survive the winter.

29
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,680
You Central Plains people are so wealthy.

30
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,440
Filthy rich and so generous with your spending.

31
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,320
I'm truly envious.

32
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,770
Look carefully.

33
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,720
All the money I can give you is right here.

34
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,480
If it gets lost, it's not my responsibility.

35
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,560
I just hope

36
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,800
your king doesn't chop off your head.

37
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,850
Don't worry.

38
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,410
Once I secure it,

39
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,079
I'll find several of our best warriors

40
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,000
to guard it day and night.

41
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,600
More people means higher risk of exposure.

42
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,440
Better to dig a cellar and seal it away.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,640
A cellar?

44
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,320
That's a good idea.

45
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,240
Guards!

46
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,280
Brother.

47
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,280
Minister He's confidential letter says

48
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,320
you should give them all 25 boxes of silver.

49
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,640
You're only giving them ten.

50
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,300
Ten boxes is more than enough.

51
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,410
They're like a bottomless pit.

52
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,480
A pack of ungrateful wolves.

53
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,079
Well,

54
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,760
all previous confidential letters have been burned.

55
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,640
This one was given to the foreign envoy by Minister He to pressure you.

56
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,170
Should we burn this one too?

57
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,400
Keep it.

58
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,120
It might be useful later.

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,560
Are you really going to deceive the foreign envoy like this?

60
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,440
Will that work?

61
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,160
I'm gambling.

62
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,970
Betting they won't be able to transport this silver.

63
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,079
They can't transport it? That's impossible.

64
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:45,800
Didn't the foreign envoy say they have other means

65
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,800
to ensure their carriages pass through without hindrance?

66
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,120
What if the silver disappears before it even gets loaded onto the carriages?

67
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,320
You mean...

68
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,220
I won't need to intervene myself.

69
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,760
Yun'er! Where are you? Dinner's ready!

70
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,680
Coming! I'll be right there!

71
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,640
Why are you climbing so high?

72
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,220
Come down quickly. Take a break, sis.

73
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,920
Are you okay, sis? Does it hurt?

74
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm fine.

75
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:32,840
Let's go.

76
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:35,360
The pearl from your hairpin is missing.

77
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,040
Really?

78
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,280
This hairpin is my sister's only keepsake.

79
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,560
Your favorite one.

80
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,050
Never mind, Yun'er. It's okay.

81
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,280
Let's eat first.

82
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,360
We can look for it tomorrow.

83
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,480
How can we do that?

84
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,560
We must find it!

85
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,040
Yun'er.

86
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,240
Let's go. Be good.

87
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,120
Look, it's right here!

88
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,180
After all that searching, it was under the lantern.

89
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,200
I know what this is.

90
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,480
This is called 'darkness under the lamp.'

91
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,880
Darkness under the lamp.

92
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,880
Yes, darkness under the lamp.

93
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,600
Yun'er.

94
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,840
You're truly my lucky star.

95
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,560
Sis, where are you going?

96
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,400
To tell Fu Mingyang about my new discovery.

97
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,680
Wait for me!

98
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,240
I want to make some more food for Brother Fu.

99
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,260
Fu Mingyang

100
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,159
I want to talk to you about where the government silver went.

101
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:37,690
Go ahead.

102
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,720
Freshly baked peach blossom cake.

103
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,800
Fu, please try some. It's delicious.

104
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,400
I specially picked fresh peach blossoms with evening dew

105
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,930
and made it with great care.

106
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,650
I've already eaten.

107
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,620
I don't really like desserts.

108
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,080
You can have it yourself.

109
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,600
Continue.

110
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,620
The silver is heavy

111
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,010
and quite conspicuous.

112
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,560
All the roads accessible by cart

113
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,160
you've had people watching.

114
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,740
Since there's no news,

115
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,120
is it possible

116
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,620
they're also waiting,

117
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,800
waiting until our patience runs out before moving it?

118
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,930
Entirely possible.

119
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,640
If they haven't moved it,

120
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,680
where would be the safest place?

121
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,260
Right where it was.

122
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,160
The most dangerous place is the safest.

123
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,200
Hidden in plain sight.

124
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,440
That's exactly right.

125
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,170
Let's go check it out together.

126
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,080
I'll go too.

127
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,810
You just stay home and cook.

128
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,520
Sis.

129
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:31,960
Be good, Yun'er.

130
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,080
We'll go scout first.

131
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,040
The fewer people, the better.

132
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,900
If we need help, I'll ask you then.

133
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,040
Okay, it's a deal.

134
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,060
Negotiate.

135
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,680
Be quiet.

136
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,080
Fu Dong.

137
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,500
What are you doing?

138
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,880
In this situation, we need to use our wits.

139
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,240
We need to be smart about this.

140
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,600
Sis.

141
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,200
Sis.

142
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,090
Look what I brought for you.

143
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,720
Watch carefully.

144
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,040
Good evening, gentlemen. Stop right there.

145
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,160
We're villagers from the nearby mountains.

146
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,400
We had a successful hunt today.

147
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,240
We saw people staying here.

148
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,080
So we brought you two roasted chickens.

149
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,000
Try some.

150
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,880
We don't want any. Let's go. Thanks anyway.

151
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,480
Brothers, it's so cold and rainy out here.

152
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,520
I've brought some fine wine too.

153
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,600
Let's go inside and have a taste.

154
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,600
Come on, don't be shy.

155
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,440
Alright, let's go.

156
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,760
Look.

157
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,920
Take the silver and leave the stones.

158
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,920
Seal it properly.

159
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,000
Restore everything to how it was.

160
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Everyone, hurry.

161
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,400
This could be a trap.
