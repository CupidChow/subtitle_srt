1
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:18,760
Jinjin.

2
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,250
Today when I was making the bed, I found

3
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,920
bloodstains on the bedding used by the previous post guard

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,320
and a fallen fingernail.

5
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,000
When did the post guard take leave for mourning?

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,600
The ninth.

7
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,560
The prefect was killed the night before.

8
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,000
Although he and the prefect were from the same hometown,

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,330
I never saw them interact with each other.

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,440
Did he have any conflicts with his colleagues?

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:45,600
No.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,800
It's this guy again.

13
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,450
Young Master, you must restrain yourself this time.

14
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,980
Brother, important documents from the border have been lost.

15
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:19,920
The

16
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,700
messenger was killed ten miles from our central post station.

17
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,680
This is serious. Ordinary postal workers can't handle it.

18
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,330
We need someone battle-hardened to take this on.

19
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,320
You mean I should go?

20
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,479
Yes.

21
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,210
Go invite Fu Mingyang here.

22
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,729
Alright.

23
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,480
Mr. Liu, you asked for me?

24
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,660
There's trouble at the border. Important documents from the post station are missing.

25
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,720
Everyone is at a loss.

26
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,840
After much consideration,

27
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,040
only you, General Fu, can take on this important mission.

28
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,570
Thank you for your trust in me, Sir Liu.

29
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,720
Young Master, are you all right?

30
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,240
This dart...

31
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,600
I feel like I've seen it somewhere before.

32
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,520
I was on the mission with Young Master.

33
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,720
I came up empty-handed.

34
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,360
But Young Master fell into a trap.

35
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,690
This is no coincidence.

36
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,240
Liu Zhen plans to use others to get rid of me.

37
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,860
Sister Jinjin.

38
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,360
Do you think the information from Lord Du is reliable?

39
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:46,730
Not sure.

40
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,280
But as long as he spreads the false news about official silver passing through tonight,

41
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,280
gets it out there,

42
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,320
we might be able to draw the snake out of its hole.

43
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,440
The messenger's murder case is definitely not simple.

44
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,040
Wasn't it just a lost letter?

45
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,520
Ten years ago, a large amount of military funds and supplies went missing.

46
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,000
Civil and military officials joined forces

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,480
claiming General Tian embezzled the military funds,

48
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,960
leading to the army's destruction.

49
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,600
General Tian wrote to the Emperor explaining the truth,

50
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,720
but that letter has never been found,

51
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,280
so he became the scapegoat.

52
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,720
General Tian Buwei.

53
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,779
I heard he killed countless enemies.

54
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,079
What a shame.

55
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,880
Shh! Footsteps.

56
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,960
Which fool was gathering information?

57
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,800
I've looked around

58
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,860
and didn't see any silver transport.

59
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,280
Look.

60
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,720
That person at the back.

61
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,680
Those thick-soled boots he's wearing

62
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,540
are unique to the postal station.

63
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,820
There's a mole in the postal station.

64
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,840
Fu Mingyang.

65
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,180
How is it you again?

66
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,920
I was about to ask the same thing.

67
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,600
You're working with them.

68
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,560
Nonsense. I'm just passing by.

69
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,280
So you're just greedy. Why hide it?

70
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,160
Everyone wants silver.

71
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,600
I'm here to investigate the case.

72
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,930
You? You're not worthy.

73
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,480
This forest is the first crime scene.

74
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,760
Fu Dong.

75
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,840
This weapon is the evidence.

76
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,600
Fine. You're not worthy.

77
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,040
You!

78
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,200
Fu Dong, let's go.

79
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,600
Fu Mingyang.

80
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,600
Boss, how can you tolerate this?

81
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,050
This delicious fruit tea will lift your spirits.

82
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,800
Drink up.

83
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,320
Something's bothering you?

84
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,960
It's been 10 years, but I still can't forget that scene.

85
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,840
Sister, don't be sad. You still have me.

86
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,100
And Mother too.

87
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,240
Our family is doing well.

88
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,560
We're fine.

89
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,530
Take me with you to the post station next time.

90
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,500
I want to help you too, Sister.

91
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,760
No, it's too dangerous.

92
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,320
My dear sister, please take me with you.

93
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,520
I promise I won't cause any trouble.

94
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,640
No discussion.

95
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,020
Remember what I told you to do.

96
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,560
Manager Tian is here.

97
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,920
Thank you for your hard work, postal brothers.

98
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,250
This is a new dessert flavor from our shop.

99
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,360
Please try it.

100
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,880
Feel free to give us feedback.

101
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,720
When Manager Tian comes to our post station, everything becomes lively.

102
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,440
This works better than any food, right?

103
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,159
Yes.

104
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,680
I should charge Station Master Liu for this.

105
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,080
I've been here so many times.

106
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,140
You must have saved so much food here.

107
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,560
That's not a problem.

108
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,560
We'll have the station master give you a red envelope later.

109
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,600
I'm just kidding.

110
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,280
We're all neighbors.

111
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,720
A close neighbor is better than a distant relative.

112
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,580
Then forget it.

113
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,560
I heard that your daily meals are quite plain.

114
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,440
I specially asked the kitchen

115
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,000
to prepare some meat filling to bring here.

116
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,320
Let's all make dumplings together later. How does that sound?

117
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320
Great.

118
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,080
Perfect. We haven't had dumplings for a long time.

119
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,720
I hope everyone will actively participate.

120
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,840
When we work with our own hands, we'll have plenty to eat.

121
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,880
Good. Xiao Ding, prepare the dough quickly.

122
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,840
Okay, let's go knead the dough. Come on.

123
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,520
Let's go.

124
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,440
Okay.

125
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,880
Jinjin, is the filling ready?

126
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,159
Yes, it's ready. Coming.

127
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,580
Here it is. Everyone start making dumplings together.

128
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,600
Sis, where have you been?

129
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,220
Why did it take so long to find a bathroom?

130
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,010
I was looking for toilet paper.

131
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,480
Hurry up. Liu Zhen has disappeared somewhere.

132
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,610
Liu Zhen! Come out right now! Liu Zhen!

133
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,520
Liu Zhen

134
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,840
so noisy.

135
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,080
Liu Zhen.

136
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,180
You scared me to death.

137
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,280
I told you not to go. It's dangerous.

138
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,720
No, I still want to go.

139
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,940
I'm really happy to help you, sister.

140
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,720
You have no idea.

141
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,520
When General Fu kicked the door just now,

142
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,920
my heart almost jumped out of my throat.

143
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,140
I thought we were about to get caught.

144
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,360
There really was someone in the room.

145
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,960
Innkeeper, come in.

146
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,560
I secretly went to the funeral home last night to examine the body.

147
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,200
It's exactly as you suspected.

148
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,040
The wounds on the messenger's body had been altered.

149
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,200
They appear to be knife wounds on the surface.

150
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,720
But the deeper part of the wounds matches the hidden weapon

151
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,050
that Lord Fu presented.

152
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,480
Can you determine the messenger's true identity or purpose?

153
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,120
He likely departed from the border,

154
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,280
carrying a very important letter to a post station

155
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,140
or the capital.

156
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,800
He was hunted down throughout his journey.

157
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,400
His body bears countless fresh and old wounds.

158
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,800
His martial skills were considerable,

159
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,360
but he was killed by a single strike to a vital point.

160
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,170
There are two possibilities. First, it was done by someone he knew.

161
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,560
Second, he was tricked into a position where he couldn't fight back.

162
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,080
Perhaps someone took advantage when he lost too much blood

163
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,520
and killed him while he was unconscious.

164
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,120
Oh, right.

165
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,920
I found this in his mouth.

166
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,440
This is the emblem of the Tianjia Army. Could he...
