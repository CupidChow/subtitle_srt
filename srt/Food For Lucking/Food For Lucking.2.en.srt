1
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,080
It's a trap! Run!

2
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,840
Guards!

3
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,840
Young master, there's something wrong with the smoke.

4
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,560
Go quickly!

5
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,520
Fu Dong!

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,280
Go back!

7
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,160
Murderer!

8
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,720
Murderer!

9
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,600
You're the one who killed the magistrate.

10
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,200
Tell me, why did you frame me?

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,840
I didn't. You still deny it?

12
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,360
You were hiding in the inner chamber when the magistrate died.

13
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,960
If not a murderer, then a thief.

14
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,720
Tell me, what did you steal?

15
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,660
Let go of that girl!

16
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,320
You're choking my Jinjin to death.

17
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,520
What else is there to explain?

18
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,850
Why are you everywhere?

19
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,050
How could you repay kindness with enmity?

20
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,240
How do I know if you're working together?

21
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,720
Right, we are working together.

22
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,039
She's the tenant and I'm the landlord.

23
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,900
Together. Why do you talk so much?

24
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,520
Xiaoliuzi.

25
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,360
Take this food to feed the dogs.

26
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,280
Move.

27
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,079
Move quickly.

28
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,160
Talk now.

29
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,880
Where is my young master?

30
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,370
Don't be rash. Wait.

31
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,920
Or I'll kill her.

32
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:52,000
No, don't do anything rash.

33
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,200
Manager Tian.

34
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,440
Let that girl go.

35
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,560
Take me instead.

36
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,160
Yun'er.

37
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,200
Sister.

38
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,080
Yun'er.

39
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:05,920
You.

40
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,360
What are you doing, Fudong?

41
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,400
Leave me alone. Do what you want.

42
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,640
I bet she wouldn't dare kill anyone. Shut up.

43
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,840
Let go of my young master.

44
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,440
You're running a criminal establishment here.

45
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,840
Kidnapping my young master and attempting murder.

46
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,300
What evidence do you have?

47
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,360
Were you two just on a sightseeing trip to the magistrate's house yesterday?

48
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,680
We're in the same boat.

49
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,680
If we make this public,

50
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,280
we'll all go down together. At least we won't be lonely in the afterlife.

51
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,410
How does that sound?

52
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,000
That's a bit extreme.

53
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,060
Young Master! Yun'er!

54
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,720
Are you alright? Are you hurt?

55
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,920
Sister, I'm fine.

56
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,960
Get out of here. You're repaying kindness with enmity.

57
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,200
People with mental problems

58
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,680
aren't welcome here.

59
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,720
She saved me.

60
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,580
Thank you, Manager Tian. I don't deserve it.

61
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,540
Just don't cause any trouble.

62
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,640
Small business like ours can't afford life-threatening situations.

63
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,170
Let's go.

64
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,930
Sis, what happened to your neck? Does it hurt?

65
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,620
It's nothing. Just had bad luck today. Got choked by a little brat.

66
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,160
Yun'er, let's go.

67
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,640
The show is about to begin.

68
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,880
The official seal

69
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,800
isn't with me.

70
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,770
Not with you?

71
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,640
Without the appointment letter,

72
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,770
how can you take office, young master?

73
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,600
We'll see about that.

74
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,400
An official who lost his seal, a soldier who forgot his sword,

75
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,440
might as well go home and take care of children.

76
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,480
Insulting an imperial official is a punishable offense.

77
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,640
A ninth-rank official wants to punish me?

78
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,520
I'm so scared.

79
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,440
Sis, I'm so cold.

80
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,920
Yun'er, I have a piece of waste paper here.

81
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,440
Why don't we use it to make a fire and warm ourselves?

82
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,640
Good.

83
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,160
Burning important imperial documents is punishable by imprisonment.

84
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,920
Is that so? But I've never been to school

85
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,040
and can't read.

86
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,660
After we burn it, you can go report us.

87
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,300
Negotiate.

88
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,080
Manager Tian.

89
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,080
We can talk about this.

90
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,880
You can name your conditions.

91
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,520
We can agree to anything.

92
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,100
I want you to tell me what information you've found.

93
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,720
These days even scumbags look this handsome.

94
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,850
This girl looks quite pleasing to the eye,

95
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,640
but she's so shallow.

96
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,210
Do you have a thick skin?

97
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,760
Information exchange. How about it?

98
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,690
Information exchange.

99
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,320
If I didn't find you attractive, I would...

100
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,330
Let me take office first, then we'll talk.

101
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,400
Fu Dong.

102
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,360
Mr. Liu is busy with official duties.

103
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,360
Please wait a little longer.

104
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,560
Young master.

105
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,440
Calm down.

106
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,080
Brother, they're from the capital after all.

107
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,860
It's not nice to keep them waiting like this.

108
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,540
Is rice from the capital somehow better?

109
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,400
Let them wait. It won't hurt them.

110
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,920
Right, let them wait.

111
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,980
My name is Fu Mingyang.

112
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,040
I was a fifth-rank cavalry general at the border.

113
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,560
Listen to him brag. A cavalry general?

114
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,040
How could someone like that end up in a place like this?

115
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,930
Listen to what he has to say.

116
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,800
I've been temporarily assigned to this post station

117
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,560
to evaluate the connection between post stations and the capital

118
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,000
and find ways to improve mail delivery speed.

119
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,320
What does he mean?

120
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,960
He's been demoted.

121
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,680
Demoted! He's been demoted!

122
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,890
It's not a demotion.

123
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,960
Don't you understand it's a temporary reassignment?

124
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,280
I get it.

125
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,480
Official Liu asked you to temporarily take over the postal guard position.

126
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,000
Let's go. I'll show you around to familiarize yourself with the place.

127
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,260
Move along, everyone!

128
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,530
This way.

129
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,600
Follow me.

130
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,240
Those two rooms we just passed - one is for storing provisions

131
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,900
and the other is for archives.

132
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,120
This room is for storing weapons.

133
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,570
Can you open it? I'd like to take a look.

134
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,040
I can't open this.

135
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,730
Official Liu keeps the key.

136
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,640
Oh, by the way,

137
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,600
there are three horses in the back yard. They're Official Liu's mounts.

138
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,260
Don't feed them or touch them.

139
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,880
They're extremely valuable.

140
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,480
Come, let me show you around.

141
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,880
Mealtime! Mealtime!

142
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:16,840
Hurry!

143
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,100
Dinner's ready, young master. Hurry up!

144
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,060
Here you go.

145
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,250
This is your new one.

146
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,860
The new one.

147
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:51,840
Let's eat.

148
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,320
Come on, eat up.

149
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,720
Have a drink. Come on.

150
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,680
Come on.

151
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,040
Hurry up.

152
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,560
Come again next time. Sure!

153
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,450
Thank you, madam. I'm leaving.

154
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,200
Innkeeper, Officer Du.

155
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,980
Officer Du, Innkeeper Tian. Please sit.

156
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,920
Do you know that these days, at 9-11 pm,

157
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,000
there are carriages transporting government silver

158
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,200
passing through the small woods behind the mountain?

159
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,360
Where do you think the government is taking all this silver?

160
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,880
Mr. Tian, do you know why the Chinese character for 'official' has two 'mouths'?

161
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,520
Why are they connected?

162
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,290
It means you need to learn to keep your mouth shut.

163
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,260
Misfortune comes from the mouth.

164
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,080
Come, Mr. Tian, have a drink.

165
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,410
I understand. Please enjoy yourself.

166
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,360
Sir Fu.

167
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,290
Our post station only has shared sleeping quarters.

168
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,600
I'm afraid you two will have to make do with this corner.

169
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,370
The two of us?

170
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,120
Is that appropriate? Yes, it is.

171
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,800
Young master, can you bear this?

172
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,450
I can't. What about you?

173
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,280
I can't bear it either.

174
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,340
Let's talk to them.

175
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,480
Go easy this time.

176
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,040
What are you doing?

177
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,570
Take it easy.

178
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,480
Tell us.

179
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,120
I don't know anything.

180
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,800
Station Master Liu ordered me to do this.

181
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,720
What did Station Master Liu order?

182
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,780
He didn't say much.

183
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,680
Just that you two

184
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,200
should sleep in the beds used by the previous station guards.

185
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,260
The previous station guards, right.

186
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,360
Where did they go?

187
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,490
In mourning for their parents.

188
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,520
Really?

189
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,960
Yes, really.

190
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,040
You two take a rest first.

191
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,140
I have something to do. I'll go first.

192
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,210
Mourning leave.

193
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,120
Sis, look what I brought you.

194
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,040
This is the newest fragrance pouch.

195
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,480
I chose calming incense for you.

196
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,880
It guarantees no more nightmares at night.

197
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,760
Where did it go again?

198
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,760
Come drink. Cheers!

199
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,850
Tonight we're not leaving until we're drunk.

200
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,560
Come, eat. Help yourself to some food.

201
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,800
So annoying.

202
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,560
What a mess.

203
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,240
Fu Dong.

204
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,050
Sleep a bit longer. I'll stand for a while.

205
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,400
I'm not tired, young master. You sleep.

206
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,440
Fu Dong, come here.
