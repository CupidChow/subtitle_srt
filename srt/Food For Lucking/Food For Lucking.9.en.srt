1
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,320
Yun'er, quickly find the medicine box.

2
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,560
What's happening, Officer Fu?

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,280
It's nothing.

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,160
This won't do.

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,410
Xiaoliu should not be able to delay them for long.

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,480
Fudong, follow me upstairs.

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,040
Hurry up.

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,440
It's the middle of the night.

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,840
The upstairs bedroom.

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,440
Search it.

11
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,360
Fudong, Yun'er.

12
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,300
You go that way.

13
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,480
Alright.

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,520
Let's go.

15
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,330
This is my daughter's room.

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,200
You patrol officers should be guarding the city gates.

17
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,280
Breaking into private homes.

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,610
Is there no law anymore?

19
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,239
Get out of the way.

20
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,000
Mom

21
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,080
Jinjin

22
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:25,360
You've ruined my daughter's reputation.

23
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,280
How is she supposed to live after this?

24
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,160
Get out!

25
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,759
Someone's been spying on the patrol camp.

26
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:56,479
Everyone must be inspected.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,600
Liu

28
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,400
Fu Mingyang has been off duty these days.

29
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,460
No one has seen him.

30
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,560
How should we notify him?

31
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,289
Go look for him at Lehuo Manor. Hurry up. Alright.

32
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,420
What are you standing there for? Take off your clothes.

33
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,000
Enjoy your meal. Please come again.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,680
Take care.

35
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,570
Welcome, Manager Tian.

36
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,820
Liu Ke wants everyone to gather at the training ground.

37
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,720
Tell him that

38
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,600
Fu Mingyang got drunk last night and caught a cold sleeping by the river.

39
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,860
He still has a high fever and can't go out.

40
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,160
I'm afraid that won't work.

41
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,360
He wants to personally

42
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,090
examine all injured suspects.

43
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,560
Everyone must show up unless they're dead.

44
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,160
Strip search?

45
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,400
The young master hasn't recovered from his cold.

46
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,660
The doctor advised he must avoid drafts.

47
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,200
If you need to examine him,

48
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,280
please do it inside with the doors and windows closed.

49
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,680
Then you can proceed with the examination.

50
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,800
You wait outside.

51
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,560
I've examined everything.

52
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,560
No fresh wounds on his chest or back.

53
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,780
Thank you for your trouble, Officer Liu.

54
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,720
I'm still recovering from my cold

55
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,280
and need to go home to rest.

56
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,610
Young master, are you alright?

57
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,280
I'm fine.

58
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,080
Thanks to you.

59
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,040
Otherwise, I would have been exposed for sure.

60
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:07,890
Let's go.

61
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,530
Someone is watching us.

62
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,840
Young master.

63
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,120
Is he feeling better?

64
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,240
Young master.

65
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,640
His fever hasn't broken.

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What should we do?

67
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,480
Use strong alcohol to wipe his body to bring down the fever.

68
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,720
Heat up another bucket of water.

69
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,160
He needs to bathe and sweat it out.

70
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,820
Innkeeper.

71
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,410
Liu Zhen is here for a meal and says he wants to visit the patient.

72
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,600
He must stay awake.

73
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,180
Station Master Liu, what a rare visitor!

74
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,890
Get to the point.

75
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,320
This world is full of uncertainties.

76
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,240
Friend or foe, right or wrong,

77
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,200
who can really tell?

78
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,320
Yun'er.

79
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,360
Truly a beauty attending to her man.

80
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,560
If Master Liu is envious,

81
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,740
you could try getting sick yourself.

82
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,320
Look at my condition.

83
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,760
Just saying a few words exhausts me.

84
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,760
Have some with me.

85
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,690
Master Fu, has your cold improved?

86
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,360
You're eating such greasy food.

87
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,040
Well, someone cares about me.

88
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,120
It's a sweet burden. You wouldn't understand.

89
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,400
Enjoy yourself.

90
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,040
I have matters to attend to at the station.

91
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,040
I'll be going now.

92
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,770
Take care, don't see me out.

93
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,080
Brother, did you find anything

94
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,780
at Lehuo Manor?

95
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,159
I found a spy, caught a cold with fever,

96
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,220
and some bloodstained gauze.

97
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,760
What a coincidence.
