1
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,560
Tian Jinjin.

2
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,520
You colluded with foreign powers

3
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,080
and stole government silver.

4
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,720
Finish this last meal

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,800
and prepare to meet your end.

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,400
Qin,

7
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,800
if you've got the guts, come after me.

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,530
She has nothing to do with this.

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,930
Then let's add another charge:

10
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,600
poisoning Fu Mingyang,

11
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,480
execution on the spot.

12
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,440
Tian Jinjin has nothing to do with the government silver.

13
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,120
What? I took the government silver.

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,120
I did everything.

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,940
This has nothing to do with you, Fu Mingyang.

16
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,880
You must live on

17
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,680
and take care of your mother and Yun'er.

18
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,080
Stop talking.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,880
Jinjin, if we die, we die together.

20
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,640
I just want to be with you.

21
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,020
Do you understand?

22
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:14,770
Don't worry,

23
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,039
I'll soon grant the wish of you ill-fated lovers.

24
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,600
Sir, the tea from the capital.

25
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,850
Release her.

26
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,920
Liu Zhen.

27
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,880
Why are you here? Just passing by

28
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,610
and thought I'd take you back to the post station.

29
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,479
Thank you.

30
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,320
Miss Yun'er is back! Hurry!

31
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,680
Yun'er!

32
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,600
Yun'er, you're back.

33
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,970
Your sister is back.

34
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,840
Yun'er, where have you been?

35
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,640
We didn't see you when we returned.

36
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,520
Sister, you're back.

37
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,940
That's wonderful.

38
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,600
It's all my fault.

39
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,170
I made you all worry.

40
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,960
I'll be more careful in the future.

41
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,480
Don't cry.

42
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,880
Let's eat, shall we?

43
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,140
What's wrong, Yun'er?

44
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,880
Let's all go eat together.

45
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,300
Let's eat. Come on.

46
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,400
Yun'er, your sister is back. Come eat.

47
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,640
Let's go together.

48
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,130
You all go ahead and eat.

49
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,380
I'm not hungry.

50
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:02,880
Yun'er.

51
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:06,960
Yun'er.

52
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,640
I don't think Commander Qin will

53
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,930
let us off so easily.

54
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,079
We'll deal with problems as they come.

55
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,079
Fu Dong and I will protect everyone.

56
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,560
Before the execution,

57
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,600
someone gave him a package of tea leaves.

58
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,530
There was a fishing picture drawn on the tea package.

59
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,040
Giving tea.

60
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,520
Fishing.

61
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,490
He wants to use us as bait to catch bigger fish.

62
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,960
Yes.

63
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,170
Our Jinjin is so clever.

64
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,600
As long as we don't give ourselves away.

65
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,320
Enough. Stop showing off.

66
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,960
Give me a break.

67
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,680
Get lost.

68
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,800
What's it to you?

69
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,680
Brother, I don't understand.

70
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,200
Fu Mingyang is about to fall.

71
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,780
Why are we helping him?

72
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,620
We can attack or defend as needed.

73
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,640
Fu Mingyang has Prince Ning backing him up.

74
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,640
His father has some influence at court.

75
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,120
If we move against him, we must be prepared to go down together.

76
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,000
Commander Qin has been searching for so long,

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,920
yet he hasn't found any evidence.

78
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,080
Besides, the imperial edict will arrive soon.

79
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,040
You mean...

80
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,120
The imperial envoy will temporarily serve as prefect.

81
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,960
Brother, your handkerchief...

82
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,290
It's an old problem.

83
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,800
Rest for a few days and take good care of yourself.

84
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,060
It's nothing serious.

85
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,580
I understand. Thank you, doctor.

86
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,120
Take care on your way out.

87
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,650
Mother, have some porridge first.

88
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,650
I made it myself.

89
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,200
Yun'er, tell me the truth.

90
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,520
What's been going on with you lately?

91
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,080
Why are you so distracted?

92
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,640
It's nothing.

93
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,530
Please have your porridge now.

94
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,040
Mother, it's all my fault you were frightened.

95
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,200
If I had known,

96
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,920
I should have sent you and my sister away earlier.

97
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,520
Jinjin,

98
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,960
how could this be your fault?

99
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,560
I'm just too tired.

100
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,640
After a few days of rest, I'll be able to work again.

101
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,840
Mother, don't push yourself.

102
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,760
Listen to the doctor and get some rest.

103
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,920
Your health is the most important thing.

104
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,650
I'll make the medicine for you.

105
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,240
No need. I'll go.

106
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,130
Here's 3,000 taels.

107
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,120
If you lose it again this time,

108
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,920
even God himself won't be able to save you.

109
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,880
Alright.

110
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,130
Don't worry,

111
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,080
I definitely won't lose it again.

112
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,480
Don't get involved with the cook's matter.

113
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,530
The waters in Zhongshu City are murky enough.

114
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,480
You absolutely must not meddle.

115
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,200
If you get yourself dragged into it,

116
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,330
it won't be worth it.

117
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,280
I'm just kidding.

118
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,880
We can't just let all that silver go.

119
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,120
We can't get answers or find anything.

120
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,520
Do you have a better idea?

121
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:37,770
Let's go.

122
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,240
I'll leave tomorrow.

123
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,600
Jin.

124
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,600
What's wrong?

125
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,600
Who upset you again?

126
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,920
My revenge remains unfulfilled and all leads are gone.

127
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,650
No news can get in from outside.

128
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,180
I'm burning with anxiety.

129
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,300
Let me tell you.

130
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,730
This revenge thing,

131
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,040
it definitely won't happen overnight.

132
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,440
Look.

133
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,800
You need to learn to enjoy life.

134
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,760
Enjoy?

135
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,920
If I want enjoyment, I should go back to your wealthy home in the capital.

136
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,520
And be your spoiled rich kid.

137
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,240
No, I'm not a spoiled rich kid.

138
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,080
I just don't want you to be so burdened.

139
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,850
Look at Tian Yun'er.

140
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,520
She's always smiling like a fool. Isn't that nice?

141
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,450
You like Yun'er?

142
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,480
How could that be possible?

143
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,940
Isn't she like our sister?

144
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,360
Alright, let's not talk about this anymore.

145
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,220
If Fu Dong hadn't gone to find Prince Ning this time,

146
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,240
we would probably be in grave danger.

147
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,680
Think about it, I'm not young anymore and still haven't taken a wife.

148
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,860
Thankfully...

149
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,680
What's up?

150
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,400
Hey.

151
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,280
It's so hot. Hey.

152
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,880
Tian Yuner.

153
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,000
What's wrong?

154
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,730
Where are you going?

155
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,760
Liu Zhen helped the young master escape from prison.

156
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,720
I asked Xiao Liuzi to prepare some dishes

157
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,720
to deliver to him.

158
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,200
My sister was released because of Liu Zhen.

159
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,000
Yes, that's right.

160
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,600
I need to go now.

161
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,920
Help! Murder!
