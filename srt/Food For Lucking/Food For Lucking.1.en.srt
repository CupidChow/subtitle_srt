1
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,040
Your Majesty.

2
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,160
General Huaihua Tianbuwei.

3
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,600
Embezzling military funds and colluding with outsiders.

4
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,000
Treason. Execution by beheading.

5
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,380
I've been wronged!

6
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,960
I must survive.

7
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,920
I must live on.

8
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,560
Madam, I'd like to pay. Five coins. All right, here you go.

9
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,000
Thank you for your business.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,600
All right.

11
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,860
Child, you must be hungry.

12
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,380
Come, sit down and have something to eat.

13
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,520
Ma'am, please let me stay.

14
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,920
Child, get up.

15
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,320
Quickly now. Listen to me and get up.

16
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,960
Don't you have parents, sister?

17
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,160
My mother said my father was killed by bandits.

18
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,480
Ma'am, please let me stay.

19
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,120
I can do any kind of work.

20
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,200
I can cook and do laundry.

21
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,600
I learn quickly and eat very little.

22
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,280
Mom, please let her stay.

23
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,240
I want someone to keep me company while working.

24
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:33,120
Alright, child. Fine, she can stay.

25
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,579
Then it's settled.

26
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,320
Mom.

27
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,240
Get up.

28
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,520
Jinjin, hurry up. It's almost done.

29
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,320
Okay.

30
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,280
Tian Jinjin, Tian Jinjin.

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,240
Yun'er, you little brat.

32
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,480
So disrespectful, calling your sister by her name.

33
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,280
You're only a few months older. Stop acting so mature.

34
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,360
You're just in time.

35
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,680
Take these two dishes to the customers at table 3.

36
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,840
The customers at tables 3 and 4 are difficult.

37
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,770
They're about to fight over a dish.

38
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,640
I'll go check.

39
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,560
Go quickly.

40
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,440
Boss, let me go instead.

41
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,140
No need. You keep working.

42
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:13,930
Alright.

43
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,320
Everything should follow the principle of first come, first served.

44
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,320
We ordered this dish first.

45
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,400
As if we came here later.

46
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,770
We arrived almost at the same time.

47
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,010
We're regular customers here.

48
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,329
As if others aren't.

49
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,120
Please don't be angry, gentlemen. Anger is bad for your health.

50
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,650
This is our waiter's fault.

51
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,920
He didn't explain clearly. The dishes weren't served incorrectly.

52
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,600
I've brought your dishes.

53
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,770
One serving for each table.

54
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,280
These two dishes are compliments from our humble establishment.

55
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,680
For my sake,

56
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,079
please return to your seats

57
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:50,210
and enjoy your meal happily, alright?

58
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,800
Since Miss Jinjin has spoken,

59
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,200
Fine, I'll give you face.

60
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,660
Come, let's drink.

61
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:58,079
Innkeeper Tian, I'm doing this for your sake.

62
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,640
Thank you, Master Du.

63
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,840
Come, let's drink.

64
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,770
You really do have a silver tongue.

65
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,720
This is our new dessert. Please try it.

66
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,600
Jinjin, are you alright?

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,320
Don't worry, Mother. It was a piece of cake.

68
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,560
That's good, that's good.

69
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,480
Young Master.

70
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,970
What are you doing here?

71
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,280
My father sent you again, didn't he?

72
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,360
Master Fu only has your best interests at heart.

73
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,040
Investigating the unjust case from 10 years ago

74
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,120
is my duty.

75
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,760
You were demoted for refusing that marriage.

76
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,400
Now you plan to investigate behind the court's back.

77
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,659
They won't let this go.

78
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,320
So what? I've never feared death.

79
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,159
Don't misunderstand your father.

80
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:49,760
General Tian, as your father's subordinate, knows best.

81
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,480
The blank appointment letter you took

82
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,080
was intentionally left for you by your father.

83
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,360
I understand.

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,360
Young Master, this is a secret letter from Prince Ning.

85
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,160
To help you proceed with your plans.

86
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,280
Hya!

87
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,600
Where to?

88
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,920
Master Fu specifically instructed

89
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,480
that I accompany you.

90
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,360
Hya!

91
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,560
Sister, you're thinking about them again.

92
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,240
Yes, it's been 10 years.

93
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:40,320
Sister, don't be sad.

94
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,760
You still have me.

95
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,640
Whatever decision you make,

96
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,770
I'll be by your side.

97
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,200
Innkeeper, it's about time.

98
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,240
Okay.

99
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,200
Yun'er, go home and get some rest.

100
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,480
Liu Zi.

101
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,720
Don't think I don't know what you're up to.

102
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,080
You're going to sneak into the magistrate's office tonight

103
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,560
to investigate my sister's father's wrongful case.

104
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,480
Take good care of my sister.

105
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,000
If anything happens to her,

106
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,060
I won't let you off.

107
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,480
Mind your own business.

108
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,040
You.

109
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,120
We've been tricked! Let's go!

110
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,640
Guards!

111
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,240
Young Master, there's something wrong with the smoke.
