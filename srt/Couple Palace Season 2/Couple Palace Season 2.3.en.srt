1
00:00:08,449 --> 00:00:12,979
(COUPLE PALACE 2)

2
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,848
(The participants' preliminary interview)

3
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,059
Oh, this person is...

4
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,189
She's a celebrity.

5
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,190
(The hosts gathered for the preliminary meeting.)

6
00:00:22,191 --> 00:00:23,259
She used to be a singer.

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,358
- So I've met her before. - Right.

8
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:25,399
Yes.

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,730
It's been 25 years since she debuted.

10
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:28,999
- She... - Hello.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Oh, hi.

12
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:32,069
(The former girl group singer, Chae Eun Jung)

13
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,099
- Have a seat. - It's been a while.

14
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,368
Yes, it has.

15
00:00:34,369 --> 00:00:35,408
You look even younger.

16
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:37,539
How could I look younger? It's been years.

17
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,479
(She debuted as a member of Cleo in 1999.)

18
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:43,209
You took good care of yourself.

19
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,149
You look prettier than back then.

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,520
- You look younger now too. - Me?

21
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,850
- How is that possible? - You...

22
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:55,459
You contacted us first.

23
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,489
That's correct.

24
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,199
Now that I'm past 40,

25
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,529
I barely have a chance to meet anyone new.

26
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,639
I think I went on almost over 100 blind dates.

27
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,098
I even had several on the same day.

28
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,108
For lunch, for coffee, and for dinner.

29
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:09,608
- I see. Do you plan to get married? - Of course.

30
00:01:09,609 --> 00:01:11,738
I signed up for a matchmaking company.

31
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:14,749
- Dating is pointless to me now. - Right.

32
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,848
- Really? - What's the point?

33
00:01:15,849 --> 00:01:17,548
- Right. - Going to the movies and dining.

34
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:18,718
(She's sick of wasting her emotion.)

35
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:19,749
(She's the one COUPLE PALACE 2 needs.)

36
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,289
- She's the one we need. - She...

37
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,249
I want to skip that whole process.

38
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,018
I want to be on COUPLE PALACE,

39
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:26,759
have a wedding next year,

40
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,760
and get pregnant by next year.

41
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:30,658
So I can give birth when I'm 45.

42
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:31,759
Thank you.

43
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,869
- This will be my last show. - We appreciate that.

44
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,710
If I fail here, I don't have any more chances.

45
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:38,870
(Round 2, women's speed train)

46
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:42,370
They'd care about my occupation.

47
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,539
They might be biased.

48
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,450
And I clearly don't look young.

49
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:51,518
My plan today is...

50
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:54,218
to get rid of the bias...

51
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:55,650
people have toward me.

52
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,819
The train is arriving.

53
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,059
(Artists)

54
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,899
- Artists. - Artists.

55
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,499
- Artists. - They're here.

56
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,969
They're going to be popular.

57
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,500
My first pick was Train Artists.

58
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:11,699
I've been waiting.

59
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:14,869
In Train Artists, there is Female Number Six.

60
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,810
- What's with her pose? - Her pose...

61
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:19,978
We're surprised too.

62
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:21,050
Amazing.

63
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:24,878
I'm trying to get rid of their bias.

64
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,348
Female Number Six is whimsical.

65
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:29,919
What is Female Number Six doing?

66
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,289
She's funny.

67
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,360
She's getting votes.

68
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:35,429
She's getting votes.

69
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,589
(2 votes)

70
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,359
Female Number Six's vote is rising.

71
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,929
- That was brilliant. - Yes, that was brilliant.

72
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,628
- We've never seen that before. - It's unprecedented.

73
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,499
- Good. - Nice.

74
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,538
Let's check their conditions for marriage.

75
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:48,485
(Revealing Female Number 6's condition for marriage)

76
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:50,508
"I want to have a baby in a year."

77
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:52,780
She knows what she wants.

78
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,279
That is...

79
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,349
(He likes it.)

80
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,509
Is there a reason?

81
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,619
Over time,

82
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,389
I'd have less chances.

83
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,659
I want to rush.

84
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,489
If I met someone here,

85
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,459
but I'm too old to have a baby,

86
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,059
it'd be sad.

87
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,359
So I froze my egg...

88
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,699
when I turned 40.

89
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,698
I have to get two shots starting from tomorrow.

90
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:21,340
(She began getting 2 shots to freeze her eggs)

91
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:24,038
It won't be easy getting pregnant with my current condition,

92
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:26,840
so I want to give birth in a year.

93
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:28,879
We will now reveal

94
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,919
Female Number Six's appearance and qualifications.

95
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,620
Oh, the girl group.

96
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:39,189
Isn't that Chae Eun Jung?

97
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,628
She seems famous.

98
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:43,089
(She's my big senior.)

99
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,900
(Bowing at 90 degrees)

100
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:48,728
A celebrity sure is different.

101
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,099
She feels experienced.

102
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,999
- She feels at home. - Yes.

103
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,968
- She's walking without hesitation. - Yes.

104
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:55,038
(Falling for her)

105
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:57,939
She's famous among people from my generation.

106
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,138
Do you know her?

107
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:00,309
No, is she a celeb?

108
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,349
- She's famous among my generation. - Really?

109
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,019
Female Number Six was...

110
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,819
a center member of a girl group.

111
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,590
She's very familiar to us.

112
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,128
I dream of...

113
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,458
a marriage like a love story.

114
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:18,160
A girlfriend-like wife.

115
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,628
I can promise you if you choose me,

116
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:23,549
your life will be full of entertainment and fun.

117
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:27,269
I'd love to marry her.

118
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,869
She had a beautiful smile.

119
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,579
She hasn't changed since her 20s.

120
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,508
Her condition for marriage, appearance, and qualifications...

121
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:37,479
have been revealed.

122
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,719
(Raising his hand)

123
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,250
Now, time for questions. Male Number 27.

124
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,159
I'm your fan.

125
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,018
- I see. - You're her fan?

126
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:50,129
Are you okay with two kids?

127
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,299
(Exclaiming)

128
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,269
- He was her fan. - That's crazy.

129
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,040
Are you okay with two kids?

130
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,170
Two kids.

131
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,970
Are you okay with having two kids?

132
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,638
How about twins?

133
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,350
- I see. - I see.

134
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,479
- Okay. - I see.

135
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,219
- Okay. - Twins are a good idea too.

136
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,849
If it comes true,

137
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,349
it'd be a blessing for our show.

138
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,088
- Yes. That'd be nice. - Yes.

139
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:17,860
- He raised his hand. - Male Number Six?

140
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,189
I think we're from the same generation.

141
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,258
Do you have an ideal type?

142
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:24,429
An ideal type.

143
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:27,199
I think having the same sense of humor is most important.

144
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,938
I have to say I'm kind of goofy,

145
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:35,139
so if the man prefers a calm and quiet woman,

146
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:37,278
he might not like me.

147
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,438
Because she is...

148
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,208
very bright and cheerful.

149
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:44,049
That's also important.

150
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,518
Male Number 27 again.

151
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,990
I'm saying this because I'm your fan...

152
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:50,119
He keeps emphasizing that he's her fan.

153
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,758
I didn't know he could be that enthusiastic.

154
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,088
To him, it's like us meeting KARINA.

155
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:55,888
(He's not interested in KARINA.)

156
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:58,159
(She's my celebrity.)

157
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,028
Is it true that your father works in the medical field?

158
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:02,669
- Yes. - Yes?

159
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,040
- You're a true fan. - You know her that much?

160
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,039
I'm curious.

161
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,268
How do you feel about people in the medical field?

162
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:10,879
People in the medical field, right.

163
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:13,438
That's why in Round One,

164
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,849
I chose doctors as the occupation I'm most interested in.

165
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:19,878
Most of my family are doctors.

166
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,550
- I see. - So I like it.

167
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:24,458
That was his big picture?

168
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:26,219
If they choose each other, it'll be awesome.

169
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,758
This is fun.

170
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,989
Make your first pick.

171
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,360
All right, you may start.

172
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,170
- There are two people. - Yes.

173
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,730
She's someone I'd like to marry.

174
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:40,139
I waited for Train Artists.

175
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,708
I want to be on COUPLE PALACE,

176
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:44,409
have a wedding next year,

177
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,279
and get pregnant by next year.

178
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,749
(A relationship newbie lawyer, Y-University graduate dentist)

179
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,949
(Who will she choose?)

180
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,449
(Female Number 6 enters the 1-on-1 date zone.)

181
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,759
(Who's her date?)

182
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,199
(Female Number 6 chose Male Number 27.)

183
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,910
It's time for your first pick. Start.

184
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,300
(They smile after making eye contact.)

185
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:15,969
I choose Male Number 27.

186
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,638
(I choose Male Number 27.)

187
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,310
- Male Number 27. - I see.

188
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,148
He's a dentist.

189
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,149
(Female Number 6 with Male Number 27)

190
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,019
I like someone with a round and soft look.

191
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,019
So it was easy for me to make a choice.

192
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:29,620
Oh, but I fell for her.

193
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:35,089
Although I loved her

194
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:37,528
(Female Number 6 and Male Number 27 are on a 1-on-1 date.)

195
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:39,059
You were on the Train Gentle and Rich, right?

196
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,060
Yes.

197
00:07:40,061 --> 00:07:41,599
(Touched)

198
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,699
Oh, I remember. Investment?

199
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:45,239
- No. - What was it?

200
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,439
I'm a dentist.

201
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:48,709
- Are you 176cm? - I'm 182cm.

202
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:49,970
Really?

203
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,938
I chose you from the start.

204
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,448
- Really? From the start? - Yes.

205
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:56,680
- You have nice teeth. - I was lucky.

206
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:59,318
I can't wait to raise children.

207
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:00,448
- Really? - Yes.

208
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:02,518
I have a lot of time after work.

209
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,290
So I want to watch my children after work.

210
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,958
- Oh, nice. - I can't do that when I'm at work.

211
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,458
Men normally don't like that.

212
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:09,129
But I really want to watch my children.

213
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:10,828
I think I saw you...

214
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:12,059
- on Lee Ji Hye's YouTube. - Yes.

215
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,528
I realized it'd be nice to get married after seeing her.

216
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:16,898
If you meet someone like her husband,

217
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:18,539
- I'd love that. - wouldn't that be nice?

218
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,610
I kind of...

219
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,638
(What?)

220
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,008
I kind of resemble her husband.

221
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:27,040
I noticed you looked very nice.

222
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,449
He said that.

223
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:32,278
That he's similar to Lee Ji Hye's husband.

224
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,418
I was so attracted to him then.

225
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:35,590
And I saw a chance.

226
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:41,789
Many of my family members passed away.

227
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,359
I'm aware.

228
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,798
(I'd like someone without familial diseases.)

229
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,299
My father has Parkinson's disease.

230
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:49,500
At the same time, he has encephalopathy.

231
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,269
He's been in a vegetative state for a long time.

232
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,668
My mom died of cancer.

233
00:08:54,669 --> 00:08:56,809
I haven't eaten ramyeon for 25 years.

234
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:00,110
And I don't eat meat when it's even slightly burnt.

235
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,879
If he gets sick, he might leave me.

236
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,049
That's what I fear.

237
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:08,289
I'm sensitive about that.

238
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,960
I don't have any major health problems.

239
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,128
Are you healthy? Do you drink a lot?

240
00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:15,959
- I don't drink at all. - That's wonderful.

241
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,200
I don't drink or smoke.

242
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,798
I always imagined marrying...

243
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:24,599
a certain type of man,

244
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,539
and he was exactly that type.

245
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:27,970
I really like him.

246
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:29,409
It was great.

247
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:32,340
Maybe I received zero votes just to meet her.

248
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:37,419
(Their endless flirting reached each others' hearts.)

249
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:40,449
(Do you have conditions for marriage related to your future spouse?)

250
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,119
I mentioned about someone who earns a lot of money.

251
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,889
Someone who's stable either financially or mentally.

252
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,288
Money is quite important.

253
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:49,428
Her annual salary...

254
00:09:49,429 --> 00:09:51,799
should be at least 40,000 dollars.

255
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,700
(Men's condition for marriage, financial stability)

256
00:09:57,299 --> 00:09:59,700
"Annual salary of over 100,000 dollars."

257
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:01,809
Over 100,000 dollars?

258
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,439
- Annual salary of 100,000 dollars? - Annual salary of 100,000 dollars.

259
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,360
- Who could they be? - This will be interesting.

260
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:07,278
It's a keyword that guarantees...

261
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,855
- the woman's financial stability. - Right.

262
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:11,719
However, what the men are attracted to about them...

263
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,720
will be important.

264
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,750
A cute silhouette.

265
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:16,709
Here are their conditions for marriage.

266
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,389
(His jaw drops automatically.)

267
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,629
Oh, no.

268
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,360
Hold on.

269
00:10:23,361 --> 00:10:24,801
(He can't believe what he's seeing.)

270
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,780
- "I'd like a supporter of DINK." - Right.

271
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:28,729
This is intense from the start.

272
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,329
I can't support DINK.

273
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,470
No, I can't.

274
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:33,169
What do I do?

275
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,639
I'll have to let her go...

276
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:36,309
unless she's really pretty.

277
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,178
Unless she's really pretty...

278
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,255
(Female Number 8 received 0 votes.)

279
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,750
For a matchmaking agency, DINK is very difficult to fulfill.

280
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,820
It won't be easy to match her with someone.

281
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,489
Female Number Eight, please come out.

282
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,810
(Female Number 8's looks and qualifications are revealed.)

283
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,519
She's famous.

284
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:54,529
I went on a date with her yesterday.

285
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:56,789
Female Number Eight is...

286
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,129
a beauty influencer with 1.3 million subscribers.

287
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:03,428
So she's the influencer.

288
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:04,989
Having 1.3 million subscribers is huge.

289
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:07,138
Her annual salary is about 300,000 dollars.

290
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:09,739
She owns a three-story house...

291
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,409
and a commercial building.

292
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:12,509
That's crazy.

293
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,750
She's the first generation of beauty influencers.

294
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,949
- She's our founder. - Unbelievable.

295
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,655
(Female Number 8, the 1st generation beauty influencer)

296
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:23,149
I have been pretty well-off as a beauty influencer.

297
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,389
Despite that, I didn't feel grounded.

298
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,590
I need a partner...

299
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,799
who can ground me well...

300
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,500
and make me feel fulfilled.

301
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:38,240
My strength is a strong mentality.

302
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:42,440
I've survived the world of social media for over ten years.

303
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:44,210
With my strong mentality...

304
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:45,439
That's amazing.

305
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,449
I'd like to meet the one and only...

306
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,179
who will overcome hardships with me.

307
00:11:50,549 --> 00:11:52,120
Her voice is beautiful.

308
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,720
(Male Number 28 picks Female Number 8.)

309
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:57,919
- His light came on. - Male Number 28.

310
00:11:58,019 --> 00:11:59,058
Why did you pick her all of a sudden?

311
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:02,459
When she talked about her mentality,

312
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,100
- Yes? - I felt a lot of respect for her.

313
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:06,059
(Thank you.)

314
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,329
Female Number Eight has an aura about her.

315
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,029
She seemed really amazing.

316
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:13,340
Her sparkling eyes looked pretty to me.

317
00:12:13,539 --> 00:12:15,709
(Male Number 28 fell for Female Number 8.)

318
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,139
You may try to woo her.

319
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,808
Oh, I'm worried.

320
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:20,849
- You're worried? - Yes.

321
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,110
(He turns into Angel)

322
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:24,919
About what?

323
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,349
If Female Number Eight is here, who would protect heaven?

324
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,990
You're my angel!

325
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,359
(That rap is always powerful whenever you hear it.)

326
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,859
- He's very good at it. - I agree.

327
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,259
He's good.

328
00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:37,459
That's some proper flirting.

329
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,059
(Will Male Number 28's flirting work?)

330
00:12:40,429 --> 00:12:41,470
Please be careful.

331
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:44,668
Please go in this way.

332
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:46,798
(Male Number 28 and Female Number 8 are matched.)

333
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,309
Gosh, yes.

334
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:51,278
(Trying to be charming by speaking Japanese)

335
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,279
Yes.

336
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:55,508
You look more handsome than yesterday.

337
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:56,509
Really?

338
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,178
Do you remember me from yesterday?

339
00:12:58,179 --> 00:12:59,418
- Of course. - Really?

340
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:00,719
How could I forget?

341
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,049
Thank you.

342
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,759
- Gosh, it's cold. - Goodness.

343
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,058
- No, thank you. - Excuse me.

344
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:10,158
You can cover yourself with it.

345
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,559
No, it's okay.

346
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:13,028
- Excuse me. - Okay, then.

347
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:14,829
(He successfully covers her with his jacket.)

348
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,329
She was very lovely.

349
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,410
(What does the future hold for these lovely people?)

350
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:23,269
(The couples are on 1-on-1 dates.)

351
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,979
(2 - Researcher for a corporation 5 - Rapper)

352
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,039
Do you remember?

353
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,509
Yes, I do.

354
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,749
I felt her mysterious charms...

355
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,720
in her singing and dancing.

356
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,158
- Isn't it nerve-racking? - Yes.

357
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:42,829
I think my performance was terrible.

358
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,270
- No, you did great. - Oh, goodness.

359
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,330
- Do you remember? - Yes, I do.

360
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:50,669
If you do, please fill them out.

361
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:55,110
Your height, 170...

362
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,538
- Is it 175cm? - That's close.

363
00:13:58,539 --> 00:14:00,879
Right? That's about right.

364
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,710
I felt good.

365
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,149
"Educational background."

366
00:14:06,049 --> 00:14:08,850
Hoseo Art Occupational Training...

367
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:11,360
That's where I teach.

368
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:14,289
My highest education was high school.

369
00:14:14,929 --> 00:14:16,460
I see.

370
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:19,399
Should I write it down?

371
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,680
Graduated from high school?

372
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:23,330
- Then... - Yes.

373
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,899
I remember. Specialists or CEOs.

374
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Right.

375
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:31,740
I thought about our conversation yesterday.

376
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,249
- Okay. - You were very friendly...

377
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,210
and said that you're okay with everything.

378
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,179
(I'd like her to have a meal with my mother once a week.)

379
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,288
(I can't believe that I'm marrying Mckdaddy.)

380
00:14:41,289 --> 00:14:42,689
(I'd be happy.)

381
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,058
(Can you marry a man with such an occupation?)

382
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:48,158
(I believe that rappers are also specialists.)

383
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:52,000
That's why it's difficult for me.

384
00:14:55,169 --> 00:14:57,100
This is your hidden condition.

385
00:14:57,769 --> 00:15:01,210
You said that a rapper is also a specialist.

386
00:15:01,409 --> 00:15:04,409
Maybe you said that...

387
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:06,240
because you recognized me.

388
00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:09,409
When that fantasy disappears,

389
00:15:11,179 --> 00:15:14,389
you might leave to search for a real specialist or a CEO.

390
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:18,019
That's what I thought.

391
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:21,830
To be honest, I had to think a lot...

392
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,299
about picking you today.

393
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:27,159
Here's what I feel on the show.

394
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,668
- I'm quite different. - In what way?

395
00:15:30,669 --> 00:15:32,799
Among other participants,

396
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:35,769
I can't help but feel left out.

397
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:42,110
I feel like I'm the only one who's strange.

398
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:45,979
The way I dress and how I carry myself.

399
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,990
You're like my savior because you picked me...

400
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,220
despite all that.

401
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:52,389
Yes.

402
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,460
I feel like you can understand me.

403
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,659
I feel reassured...

404
00:15:59,129 --> 00:16:01,129
by that side of you.

405
00:16:01,429 --> 00:16:04,070
In the end, we were matched again.

406
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,500
- It's a good thing. - Yes.

407
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:07,870
(Romance beyond realistic conditions)

408
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:10,740
We'll have to pick again next time.

409
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,480
- Yes. - Will you pick me again...

410
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,750
next time?

411
00:16:17,049 --> 00:16:19,149
That's needless to say.

412
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,019
- Really? - Yes.

413
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,990
I'm definitely more interested in her...

414
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,730
than before.

415
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,970
(One man who has yet to press the button)

416
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,099
There aren't many trains left.

417
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,439
(Trains are about to end, but he seems unenthusiastic.)

418
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,069
I wasn't interested in any of them.

419
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,580
I'm not really interested.

420
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:49,009
(Male Number 19 has been watching as a viewer.)

421
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,950
This is Female Number 13.

422
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,649
You may press the button right away.

423
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,590
It's Number 13.

424
00:16:56,889 --> 00:16:58,889
(Male Number 19 picks for the first time.)

425
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,990
Actually, we expected her to be the most popular.

426
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,700
Female Number 13, please come out.

427
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,639
(Smiling)

428
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,409
(Number 13's walk-out song)

429
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,240
("LIKEY" by TWICE)

430
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:18,108
(LIKEY)

431
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:19,740
(Suddenly, Male Number 19 is excited.)

432
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:23,449
She went on a date...

433
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,250
with the Number 19 pharmacist during Round 1.

434
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:31,519
(Their interest in Eastern philosophy overlapped.)

435
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:36,559
(Male Number 19 sensed that it was fate.)

436
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:41,569
Look how happy Number 19 looks.

437
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:45,640
I thought about waiting for Number 13,

438
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,609
so when she came out, I pressed the button right away.

439
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:51,239
I only pressed it once.

440
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,585
(Male Number 19 was waiting for Female Number 13.)

441
00:17:52,609 --> 00:17:55,209
(I've been waiting for you.)

442
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,210
(Proper and adorable employee at a conglomerate)

443
00:17:56,211 --> 00:17:58,950
Although I'm a blunt woman from Gyeongsang Province,

444
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,619
I'm very adorable to my boyfriend.

445
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,349
I'm Number 13.

446
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,289
I wrote my ideal type...

447
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,288
as someone who longs to be wise...

448
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:09,890
and intelligent.

449
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:13,699
I'd like to find someone who will overcome...

450
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,929
difficulties with me.

451
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,369
Nice to meet you.

452
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,539
(Male Number 19 can't stop smiling.)

453
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:21,339
Number 12.

454
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,769
I have a question for Number 13.

455
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,809
I'd like to ask.

456
00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:27,808
Until when do you want to work...

457
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:30,180
Is there a reason behind your condition?

458
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:32,180
- Number Six. - Yes.

459
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:34,049
What do you think of lawyers?

460
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:36,789
- Lawyers? - He asked her point-blank.

461
00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:39,389
- He's going at her head-on. - What did he say?

462
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,990
- "What do you think about me?" - I see.

463
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:47,558
(How will she answer such a forward comment?)

464
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:50,470
I don't think I'm more attracted to someone...

465
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:53,839
because of someone's career like being a lawyer or so on.

466
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,239
Let's say our age is revealed.

467
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,909
What if there's a big age gap?

468
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,680
I prefer someone around my age.

469
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,779
- I understand. - My gosh.

470
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,608
- He's looking for the button. - He's looking for the button.

471
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:03,650
My gosh.

472
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,919
(Male Number 6 steps back as she makes her preferences clear.)

473
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,449
(Smiling)

474
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:11,220
I'm quite clear about what I want and don't want.

475
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,759
- You are? - Yes.

476
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:14,758
(Proper and adorable employee at a conglomerate)

477
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:18,028
Female Number 13 received the highest number of votes.

478
00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:20,400
We will begin with her first pick.

479
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,298
It's time for your first pick. Start.

480
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:26,179
(Female Number 13 goes to choose her 1st pick.)

481
00:19:26,869 --> 00:19:28,038
I wonder whom she'll pick.

482
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:29,268
(She slowly approaches the guys.)

483
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:30,309
I'm nervous.

484
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,109
Gosh, I'm nervous.

485
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,709
She didn't have any obligations to pick me back.

486
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:40,450
But I realized that I would be disappointed if she didn't.

487
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,650
She's clear about what she wants or doesn't want.

488
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,489
I'll pick Male Number 19.

489
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,930
She chose Male Number 19.

490
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:52,598
(She didn't even hesitate for a moment.)

491
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:53,630
To tell you the truth,

492
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,699
I saw that he turned on the light...

493
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,200
the moment my silhouette was revealed.

494
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,940
It's Number 13.

495
00:20:01,941 --> 00:20:03,038
(He pressed the button as if he had been waiting for her.)

496
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,609
Like he had been waiting for me.

497
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:07,439
(Female Number 13 saw the whole thing.)

498
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,480
I felt that we clicked.

499
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,619
So I was excited.

500
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,150
All right. Congratulations.

501
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,719
I was monitoring the room...

502
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,159
- from the waiting room. - Yes.

503
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,220
I see.

504
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:22,329
But I was a bit touched that you didn't vote for anyone.

505
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,099
All right. We're done with the last train now.

506
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,299
In the end, we weren't...

507
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,030
- the leading roles. - We weren't.

508
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:34,670
(A deep sigh)

509
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:39,709
We ask all 30 men to gather in the studio.

510
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:40,909
(Let's go.)

511
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,809
- Let's go. - Let's go.

512
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:47,420
We ask all 30 women to gather in the studio.

513
00:20:47,849 --> 00:20:49,619
I wonder what we're going to do.

514
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:52,319
- What's this? - Something's changed.

515
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:54,859
Will we finally get to face each other?

516
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:56,858
I guess we're doing something.

517
00:20:56,859 --> 00:20:58,559
I wonder what we'll do here.

518
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,059
Everyone is here.

519
00:21:00,329 --> 00:21:02,630
It feels different now that everyone is here. Right?

520
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,269
The speed trains from Rounds 1 and 2 are over.

521
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,369
Next, you will have a chance to meet everyone at once.

522
00:21:10,609 --> 00:21:12,880
It will be a large-scale speed date.

523
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:15,349
- A large-scale speed date. - A speed date?

524
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:16,980
Right now?

525
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,380
But...

526
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:24,250
not everyone can join the next round.

527
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,220
What? What does that mean?

528
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,759
If you don't have anyone to go on a date with,

529
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,160
you cannot join the next round.

530
00:21:33,529 --> 00:21:34,670
- Now? - Yes.

531
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,970
Based on our votes from earlier.

532
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,470
The voting will begin.

533
00:21:39,869 --> 00:21:43,868
Out of 30 people, you must choose two people...

534
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:46,180
you'd like to go on a date with in the next round.

535
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:50,650
The votes will be reflected on the next date.

536
00:21:51,619 --> 00:21:53,920
Will this be decided based on the vote we just did?

537
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,770
Yes, based on the vote we did earlier.

538
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,089
That's crazy.

539
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,289
- This is really tough. - Seriously.

540
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,559
If you didn't receive any votes,

541
00:22:02,829 --> 00:22:03,960
you must leave...

542
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,029
the show.

543
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,400
- What? - Already?

544
00:22:07,529 --> 00:22:09,299
- People can get eliminated today? - What?

545
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:12,740
- Already? - Some of us will be eliminated.

546
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:13,970
That can't be.

547
00:22:13,971 --> 00:22:15,539
- That can't be. - That can't be.

548
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:18,440
If you received only one vote...

549
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,180
from someone who didn't get any votes,

550
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,470
you cannot join the next round either.

551
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,750
I didn't get that. What does that mean?

552
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,479
Even if I got one vote,

553
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,880
a vote from someone who didn't get any votes wouldn't count.

554
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,490
So that vote won't count.

555
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,835
Things aren't looking good for me.

556
00:22:33,859 --> 00:22:34,960
My heart is pounding.

557
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,589
My lips are getting dry.

558
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:38,430
All right.

559
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:43,069
We will now announce those who must leave the show.

560
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:46,670
If your names are called, please get up from your seats.

561
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,940
(Everyone is nervous.)

562
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,809
So they just leave like this?

563
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,079
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

564
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:57,070
We'll announce the eliminated male participants first.

565
00:22:57,609 --> 00:23:00,019
Train Hardworking and Diligent.

566
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:01,548
It's me.

567
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:03,019
I think I'm going home.

568
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,159
(Don't say that.)

569
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,358
(Train Hardworking and Diligent)

570
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:07,659
(16: The prince of the sea, the chief mate)

571
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,189
(Male Number 16's condition for marriage)

572
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,629
(Please spend 8 months out of the year alone.)

573
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:14,799
(Male Number 16 received 0 votes in the end.)

574
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,598
(Good son and owner of an izakaya who bought his mom a house)

575
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:17,630
I think it's me.

576
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,699
(Your number is one.)

577
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,916
(I've never been in a relationship.)

578
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,210
(Really?)

579
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,139
(I want someone who can help my business.)

580
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,640
(You can play the viola at my restaurant.)

581
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,380
(Male Number 29 went on a date with Female Number 1.)

582
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:33,950
Male...

583
00:23:33,951 --> 00:23:35,149
(The prince of the sea, the chief mate)

584
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,288
(Good son and owner of an izakaya who bought his mom a house)

585
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,389
(Who will be eliminated from Train Hardworking and Diligent?)

586
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:38,390
Male Number 29.

587
00:23:38,391 --> 00:23:40,960
(Male Number 29 is eliminated.)

588
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,659
I think there was a problem...

589
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,460
when I went on a date with Female Number One.

590
00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:46,559
Well, there's nothing I can do about the result.

591
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:50,929
All right. Train Manly Men.

592
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,439
(Train Manly Men)

593
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,899
(17: Formerly served in HID, Private secretary)

594
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,508
(25: Employee of a trade-related public enterprise)

595
00:23:55,509 --> 00:23:56,538
Male...

596
00:23:56,539 --> 00:23:58,815
(5: Introverted rapper who is good at taking care of the house)

597
00:23:58,839 --> 00:23:59,979
(I want to meet CEOs or someone with a specialized career.)

598
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,750
This is your hidden condition.

599
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:03,509
When that fantasy disappears,

600
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:06,549
you might leave to search for a real specialist or a CEO.

601
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:09,518
(Thinking)

602
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:12,319
We'll have to pick again next time.

603
00:24:12,589 --> 00:24:13,889
Will you pick me again...

604
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,190
next time?

605
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,299
That's needless to say.

606
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:21,899
(Male Number 5 went on a date with Female Number 2 twice.)

607
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,999
(Train Manly Men)

608
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,098
(25: Employee of a trade-related public enterprise)

609
00:24:24,099 --> 00:24:26,768
I like the hourglass figure.

610
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:28,768
I like sexy women.

611
00:24:28,769 --> 00:24:31,240
I like curvy women with the hourglass figure.

612
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:34,880
He cares a lot about women's figures.

613
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,009
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

614
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:39,680
Train Manly Men.

615
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,819
Male...

616
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:43,789
Number 25.

617
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,759
(Male Number 25 is eliminated.)

618
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:51,829
Oh, no.

619
00:24:53,529 --> 00:24:54,799
Train Manly Men.

620
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,599
- Seriously? This is crazy. - All right.

621
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,740
Male Number Five.

622
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,409
What?

623
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:04,139
(Male Number 5?)

624
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,609
(Male Number 5 is eliminated.)

625
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,950
But he kept going on dates.

626
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:11,450
Something is off.

627
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:15,190
(What happened to Female Number 2 and Male Number 5?)

628
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:18,689
We'll have to pick again next time.

629
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:19,959
Will you pick me again...

630
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,420
next time?

631
00:25:21,589 --> 00:25:24,289
(Female Number 2 said she would pick Male Number 5.)

632
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:27,329
My gosh, but...

633
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:30,529
if he were truly interested in me,

634
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,069
he wouldn't even think about it.

635
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:36,939
You might leave to search for a real specialist or a CEO.

636
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,838
That's what I thought.

637
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:41,479
To be honest, I had to think a lot...

638
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,909
about picking you today.

639
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,449
After hearing that...

640
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,250
things kind of shattered for me.

641
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:52,489
If he were certain about me, he wouldn't have hesitated.

642
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:54,589
But the fact that he had to think about it...

643
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,859
I thought it was over.

644
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,329
I didn't think I could do it.

645
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:01,699
This is a big world.

646
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,769
Let's find someone I can click with.

647
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,099
Gosh, that's hard.

648
00:26:07,069 --> 00:26:09,508
I thought I would be able to talk to him.

649
00:26:09,509 --> 00:26:10,568
(The two couldn't make it...)

650
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,089
(after their fateful first encounter.)

651
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,140
We'll announce the female participants.

652
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,779
Female Number Two.

653
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,808
(As Male Number 5's vote was invalid, )

654
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:19,219
(she's also eliminated.)

655
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,720
Gosh, I got goosebumps.

656
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,849
No way. I can't believe this.

657
00:26:24,089 --> 00:26:26,690
I had this vague idea of wanting to get married.

658
00:26:27,589 --> 00:26:29,959
Well, it's clear to everyone.

659
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,730
Realistically speaking, my career is unstable.

660
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:36,169
There were more negative takes on my job...

661
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:40,269
when it came to women looking for someone to date.

662
00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:43,710
Those views made me feel small.

663
00:26:45,109 --> 00:26:47,239
But my principles still haven't changed.

664
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,449
What's more important to me than their occupation...

665
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:51,255
or the amount of money they saved so far is...

666
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,950
the person itself.

667
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,220
I'm done.

668
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,319
Next. Female...

669
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,230
Oh, no.

670
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:07,400
Female...

671
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:09,669
Number One.

672
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:13,069
(1: A violist who struggles with first encounters)

673
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,739
Female Number 11.

674
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,768
(11: A lawyer with a private practice)

675
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:18,778
Really?

676
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:20,380
Male Number 12.

677
00:27:20,609 --> 00:27:21,640
Male Number 18.

678
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,880
Female Number Seven.

679
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:25,349
Female Number 16.

680
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:26,650
Female Number 22.

681
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,990
- What's going on? - This is too much.

682
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,626
This many people are getting eliminated?

683
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:33,119
If your names have been called,

684
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:37,190
please leave the show.

685
00:27:40,829 --> 00:27:41,930
This is crazy.

686
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:44,829
This is pretty bitter.

687
00:27:45,099 --> 00:27:46,470
It really is.

688
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,469
I think this was a good opportunity for me...

689
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:52,008
to be more flexible when looking for someone...

690
00:27:52,009 --> 00:27:53,980
rather than being too rigid.

691
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,680
Marriage is a reality.

692
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,750
This is so embarrassing.

693
00:28:00,019 --> 00:28:02,950
It's a pity because I didn't get to promote myself.

694
00:28:03,589 --> 00:28:07,460
I could have participated more actively.

695
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:09,390
So that's a bit disappointing.

696
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,288
It's not easy.

697
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:13,460
(Marriage isn't easy.)

698
00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:16,169
(A week has passed by.)

699
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:18,029
(It's the day of Round 3 at last.)

700
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:22,210
(A new kind of excitement awaits at Round 3.)

701
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:24,409
Hello, everyone.

702
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:26,338
- Hello. - Hello.

703
00:28:26,339 --> 00:28:27,740
What are you looking at?

704
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,578
There's some stuff displayed here.

705
00:28:30,579 --> 00:28:32,019
- My gosh. - This?

706
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:34,749
I see. So this is how it is.

707
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,750
(They're looking at the profile cards.)

708
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,750
I need my glasses.

709
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,160
I need my glasses to take a closer look.

710
00:28:40,089 --> 00:28:41,518
(All 48 single men and women...)

711
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:42,789
(are ready.)

712
00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:44,559
- You know? - Hey.

713
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:46,099
Hey, what's that?

714
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:48,259
COUPLE PALACE 2.

715
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,798
Welcome to Round Three,

716
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:54,159
- the large-scale speed date. - The large-scale speed date.

717
00:28:54,869 --> 00:28:58,368
You will have a chance to meet with everyone...

718
00:28:58,369 --> 00:28:59,880
- Nice. - today.

719
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:02,980
Check the 24 profile cards of opposite-gender participants.

720
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:06,779
And choose three participants you would like to meet.

721
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,549
- Did you pick three? - Your first pick was...

722
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,048
Did you pick three?

723
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:12,159
- I did. - My gosh.

724
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,689
- Who was your first pick? - Mine was Female Number 18.

725
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,529
Who did you pick?

726
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:17,829
I picked Female Number 18.

727
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:20,106
(Male Number 7 has only eyes for Female Number 18.)

728
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:22,090
(Meanwhile, there were some who were indecisive.)

729
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,045
(Male Number One even knelt on the ground.)

730
00:29:24,069 --> 00:29:25,169
You're very close to the cards.

731
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,868
- Yes. I can't see well. - I should do the same.

732
00:29:26,869 --> 00:29:28,068
I need to get close.

733
00:29:28,069 --> 00:29:29,716
(They're studying the cards passionately.)

734
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,609
Isn't Male Number 11 nice too?

735
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,239
He's popular.

736
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,278
- Is he super popular? - He's super popular.

737
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,409
(11: A head dentist at the best dental clinic in Bupyeong)

738
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:39,019
- Male Number Three isn't bad. - Right?

739
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,980
Aren't I good at judging men?

740
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,349
Male Number 13. Gosh, he's cute.

741
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:45,919
Male Number 13 is popular.

742
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,890
- Is he popular? - Yes, totally.

743
00:29:48,589 --> 00:29:49,959
Male Number Four is handsome too.

744
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,759
I care a lot about looks.

745
00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:55,569
Male Number Four? He's my type, appearance-wise.

746
00:29:55,829 --> 00:29:56,970
Same here.

747
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,969
(What? You too?)

748
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:00,868
- I thought he was great. - Yes.

749
00:30:00,869 --> 00:30:02,940
Isn't Male Number Four popular?

750
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,439
- He's popular. - Really?

751
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,479
(She's the only woman who went on a date with him.)

752
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,839
He's handsome.

753
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,509
Male Number Four...

754
00:30:09,049 --> 00:30:12,279
He's very popular among the ladies.

755
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,548
You had a date with Male Number Four.

756
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:17,618
But he's way too handsome. He's too much for me.

757
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:20,818
When I'm in front of him, I feel like I'm turning into a fool.

758
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,230
- You couldn't talk to him. - Right.

759
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:25,730
I don't think I can see him again.

760
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:28,969
It's too much on my heart.

761
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:30,529
Seriously. What's wrong with me?

762
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:34,269
My gosh.

763
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:35,909
- Did you know? - What?

764
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:38,740
We're not even talking about the men from Train Gentle and Rich.

765
00:30:39,609 --> 00:30:40,609
(Meanwhile, what about the guys from Train Gentle and Rich?)

766
00:30:40,609 --> 00:30:41,609
What?

767
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,249
- There was a female duo... - Yes.

768
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,720
Called B.B a long time ago.

769
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:46,819
(I know them.)

770
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,889
(Time traveling to the old days)

771
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:50,588
Of course, I know the song, "Heaven's Land Star's Land."

772
00:30:50,589 --> 00:30:51,989
We know the song.

773
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:54,258
- So we must be quite old. - I don't know that song.

774
00:30:54,259 --> 00:30:56,328
When people hear their name, they think of BIBI,

775
00:30:56,329 --> 00:30:58,528
- Right. - Yes. Gosh, I'm in trouble.

776
00:30:58,529 --> 00:30:59,529
Nice to meet you, sirs.

777
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,499
I don't know the song.

778
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,828
I looked it up. That's how I know.

779
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:05,440
(Let's go on a date already.)

780
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:08,710
(We root for your successful marriage.)

781
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:13,479
My gosh.

782
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,778
(A fitting space for the large-scale date)

783
00:31:16,779 --> 00:31:18,778
- What's this? - So this is the setup?

784
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:20,419
- I see. This is the place. - I'm excited.

785
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,818
(The 24 men enter first.)

786
00:31:21,819 --> 00:31:24,348
My gosh. I hate sitting based on our numbers.

787
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:26,518
I'd rather sit with the guys from Train Gentle and Rich.

788
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:29,759
- Why? We're fun too. - No, you guys are too handsome.

789
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,390
Here they come.

790
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,499
(Focused)

791
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,559
They're here.

792
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,170
I'm getting a dopamine rush.

793
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,068
They look different.

794
00:31:38,069 --> 00:31:39,349
I'm getting a new feeling again.

795
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:42,108
All right. Today, we'll proceed with the speed date, Round Three.

796
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:43,868
Things begin to deepen from Round Three.

797
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:46,038
This is when many connections begin.

798
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:48,079
- And things will get interesting. - Of course.

799
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,480
- I saw this place on TV. - Right.

800
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,119
It feels weird.

801
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:54,578
They seem different from a week ago.

802
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,048
Right. They look very different.

803
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:59,789
The ladies dressed up to the nines today.

804
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,359
This is war today.

805
00:32:02,029 --> 00:32:04,930
A lot of guys are wearing black. Right?

806
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:08,400
Wait. So everyone will be watching?

807
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:10,269
Are we going to talk over there?

808
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,528
(That's right.)

809
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:12,899
(Oh, wow)

810
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,900
Really?

811
00:32:13,901 --> 00:32:17,109
Whatever you imagine, you can find every ideal type here.

812
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:18,809
COUPLE PALACE 2.

813
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:22,409
Welcome to the large-scale speed date,

814
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:23,548
Round Three.

815
00:32:23,549 --> 00:32:27,079
(Getting excited)

816
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:30,589
During Round Three, the large-scale speed date,

817
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:33,818
you can ask three people you want to meet...

818
00:32:33,819 --> 00:32:37,789
on a date by giving them your profile card.

819
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:41,259
The time limit for each date is 40 minutes.

820
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:46,269
But you can't spend longer than 15 minutes with 1 person.

821
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:50,410
If someone you'd like to meet is already on a date,

822
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:53,640
you can line up and wait.

823
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,278
So if things go south,

824
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:58,409
I could spend the whole day sitting here alone.

825
00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:59,548
(They could end up spending the whole day in their chairs.)

826
00:32:59,549 --> 00:33:02,419
Last year, I just sat here alone for two hours.

827
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,489
Really?

828
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:05,659
But people were eliminated after this round last season.

829
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,660
A lot of them were eliminated.

830
00:33:06,661 --> 00:33:08,859
- Half of them were eliminated. - Right.

831
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:10,490
Today is a scary day.

832
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:14,359
Men and women will take turns for the speed date.

833
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:18,900
Men will sit at the speed-dating table first.

834
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,740
You can now ask them out on a date.

835
00:33:25,009 --> 00:33:26,078
Oh, my.

836
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:29,210
If you wish to ask the named participant on a date,

837
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:32,778
you can personally deliver your profile card to him.

838
00:33:32,779 --> 00:33:35,079
- I'm nervous. - What is this?

839
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:36,719
This is crazy.

840
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,759
- Oh, my. - My goodness.

841
00:33:39,089 --> 00:33:40,359
I'm good at this.

842
00:33:40,589 --> 00:33:42,018
This is... My gosh.

843
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:43,459
- If they don't get a lot of cards, - Right.

844
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,890
It will be embarrassing.

845
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:47,130
Male Number Three.

846
00:33:48,029 --> 00:33:49,969
He's the one who works at a conglomerate in Tokyo, Japan.

847
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,130
Right.

848
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:52,939
My gosh, what do I do?

849
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,940
(A corporate employee from a major Japanese company in Tokyo)

850
00:33:53,941 --> 00:33:56,269
(Who will ask him out?)

851
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,309
- Me. - My gosh.

852
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,308
(Thank you.)

853
00:34:01,309 --> 00:34:03,180
(She bravely starts off the speed date.)

854
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:06,219
Thank you.

855
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,650
(He keeps getting more profile cards.)

856
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,718
Oh, it's you. Thank you.

857
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,118
(Female Number 19 also gives him her profile card.)

858
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:15,759
(5 votes)

859
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,828
Hold on.

860
00:34:16,829 --> 00:34:18,158
(Female Number 10 is the last one to get up.)

861
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,659
(Staring)

862
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:21,428
(She's heading to Male Number 19 instead of Male Number 3?)

863
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:22,999
- Wait. It's not his turn yet. - What?

864
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,529
(Flustered)

865
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:25,839
- It's not my turn yet. - What?

866
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,098
- It's only for Male Number Three... - Wait.

867
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:29,009
(Laughing)

868
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:32,038
- It's not his turn yet. - We have to follow the order.

869
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:33,538
No?

870
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:35,109
(Nonetheless, thank you.)

871
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,149
She was impatient.

872
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,710
(Embarrassed)

873
00:34:38,349 --> 00:34:41,319
(Male Number 4 watched the whole thing.)

874
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,389
This is painful.

875
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,090
(Embarrassed)

876
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:46,559
Male Number Four.

877
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,058
A graduate of a prestigious university in China...

878
00:34:49,059 --> 00:34:50,089
who works at a conglomerate.

879
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,729
He went on a date with Female Number 10 in Round 1.

880
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:54,529
She said she liked short guys.

881
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:56,669
But he didn't vote for her in Round Two.

882
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,130
- Wait. Why not? - Okay.

883
00:34:58,969 --> 00:35:03,239
She said she didn't prefer tall guys.

884
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:06,279
I'm not really into tall guys.

885
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,808
- Is that so? - Yes.

886
00:35:07,809 --> 00:35:09,948
I don't find tall guys attractive.

887
00:35:09,949 --> 00:35:11,308
I hesitated.

888
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:13,649
So I couldn't vote for her then.

889
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,349
I ended up regretting it.

890
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:19,219
I've never felt this way. So I couldn't sleep.

891
00:35:20,289 --> 00:35:22,529
Just one.

892
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:23,590
(Just one...)

893
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,058
Just give me one.

894
00:35:25,059 --> 00:35:29,069
(He's desperate as he doesn't want to have any regrets.)

895
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,630
Male Number Four.

896
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,299
Gosh, it's starting now.

897
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,699
(Nervous)

898
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:37,039
(After his number is called, ladies come out right away.)

899
00:35:37,409 --> 00:35:38,609
(1 vote)

900
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:39,880
He's so popular.

901
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:42,110
(Envious)

902
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,078
Gosh, that's a lot.

903
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,408
(5 votes)

904
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:46,550
How many cards did he get?

905
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:51,049
But I only focused on whether or not Female Number Ten...

906
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:53,590
would give me her card.

907
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,489
(Female Number 10 didn't come to him.)

908
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,659
Just give me one.

909
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,630
You didn't go yet.

910
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,969
(At that moment...)

911
00:36:07,969 --> 00:36:12,479
(It's the only card Male Number 4 was hoping to get.)

912
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,480
Luckily, I got her card.

913
00:36:14,909 --> 00:36:16,479
I was relieved.

914
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,509
(Male Number 4 got a total of 8 votes.)

915
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:21,150
The date will last 40 minutes.

916
00:36:21,619 --> 00:36:23,549
The date will proceed in the order in which they arrive.

917
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,018
- Gosh. - It's starting already?

918
00:36:25,019 --> 00:36:26,379
- We can just go? - What do we do?

919
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,718
- Gosh. - Should I go?

920
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:29,259
- Should I go? - Do we have to run out?

921
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,260
(Let's start the speed dating!)

922
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:32,530
(All running)

923
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,558
(They all run to their dates.)

924
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:35,599
They're all running.

925
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:37,828
- Hello. - Hello.

926
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:39,476
(Is it Female Number 10 whom he's been waiting for?)

927
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,569
(His 1st date is Female Number 24.)

928
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,809
I'm blushing. My gosh, this is embarrassing.

929
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:44,138
How do we do this?

930
00:36:44,139 --> 00:36:45,619
(At that moment, Female Number 10...)

931
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,839
What's going on?

932
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,279
(Puzzled)

933
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,309
What?

934
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,909
My gosh.

935
00:36:51,579 --> 00:36:53,819
I voted for you in the first impression vote.

936
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,820
Thank you.

937
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,319
(I want us to raise a dog when we get married)

938
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,389
A dog.

939
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,118
Are you allergic to dogs?

940
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,718
No, I'm not allergic to them.

941
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:01,788
(Approved!)

942
00:37:01,789 --> 00:37:04,189
- Do you often walk your dog? - Would you like to join me?

943
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,359
(A new kind of flirting)

944
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,559
(Flustered)

945
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,598
- Our hidden conditions... - Right.

946
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,730
- are quite similar. - Right.

947
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,368
And we have the same number.

948
00:37:13,369 --> 00:37:15,069
- That's right. - Yes.

949
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,570
This is meant to be.

950
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,538
(Female Number 10 is waiting to go on a date with another man.)

951
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:23,380
I kept checking Female Number Ten.

952
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:25,880
You'll have to remember me.

953
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,549
You have a sweet face.

954
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:30,619
You know that you're handsome, right?

955
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,488
(Glancing)

956
00:37:32,489 --> 00:37:34,090
Gosh, it's an honor.

957
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,960
It's an honor to hear that.

958
00:37:36,789 --> 00:37:38,389
I couldn't wait to talk to her.

959
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,299
(The date is already halfway through.)

960
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,098
- Hello. - Hello.

961
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:43,869
(Meanwhile, Female Number 10 is...)

962
00:37:44,369 --> 00:37:46,439
(is on a date with another guy.)

963
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,300
- I'm Male Number 19. - Yes.

964
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:50,968
(They haven't had a moment together even halfway past the date.)

965
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:53,739
Round Three might be my last chance.

966
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,179
I was like, "Okay."

967
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:58,110
(Will his chance with her end because he hesitated in Round Two?)

968
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,880
I'm not sure if I would have a chance to talk to her.

969
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:03,819
But it was hard to pick only one thing about her.

970
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,260
She was very close to my ideal type.

971
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:07,218
(Will he not be able to talk to her?)

972
00:38:07,219 --> 00:38:09,860
You have five minutes until the date is over.

973
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:12,860
(Disappointed)

974
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,729
But...

975
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:18,529
(Female Number 10 lines up for Male Number 4...)

976
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:20,300
(with 5 minutes left in the date.)

977
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:23,139
(The two of them finally get to face one another.)

978
00:38:24,739 --> 00:38:27,639
I was like, "Am I nervous?"

979
00:38:28,579 --> 00:38:29,679
Thank you for your time.

980
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,849
- My gosh. - We don't have much time left.

981
00:38:34,949 --> 00:38:36,050
Have you been well?

982
00:38:37,889 --> 00:38:39,889
- It's been a while. - It has.

983
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:44,329
Do you remember the chat we had?

984
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:46,829
- I do. - Do you?

985
00:38:47,429 --> 00:38:51,329
I was pretty confused in the previous round.

986
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,139
- Really? - Yes.

987
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:57,639
You said that you didn't prefer tall men,

988
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:00,780
so I didn't press the button in the first place.

989
00:39:01,179 --> 00:39:05,179
But I still had a good feeling from Round One,

990
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,380
so...

991
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,489
When we first chatted,

992
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:14,519
you were honestly so handsome...

993
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:18,289
that I couldn't speak.

994
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:20,529
- Really? - Yes.

995
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:22,969
You were way too good-looking.

996
00:39:23,369 --> 00:39:26,868
- You flatter me. - I actually thought about seeing...

997
00:39:26,869 --> 00:39:28,376
someone who made me comfortable, but...

998
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,210
- Really? - Yes. But...

999
00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:34,738
I ended up writing your number.

1000
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:35,749
- Really? - Yes.

1001
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:36,750
(Relieved)

1002
00:39:36,751 --> 00:39:38,610
I actually told a lie.

1003
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,018
- What lie? - I lied to you.

1004
00:39:42,019 --> 00:39:45,889
When you asked me why I hurt my hand...

1005
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,519
How did you hurt your hand?

1006
00:39:49,059 --> 00:39:51,529
I burned my hand at work.

1007
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:54,860
What kind of job burns your hand?

1008
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,069
It wasn't at work.

1009
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:00,369
I was making pan-fried meatballs late at night...

1010
00:40:00,969 --> 00:40:02,340
- and burned my hand. - Really?

1011
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:05,069
It was a bit...

1012
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,178
(It was too embarrassing.)

1013
00:40:06,179 --> 00:40:07,739
embarrassing to say so.

1014
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,408
I was embarrassed.

1015
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:10,809
(She's cute.)

1016
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,480
- I see. I had no idea. - Yes.

1017
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:16,389
Ever since then, I've been feeling...

1018
00:40:16,949 --> 00:40:19,789
pretty guilty about lying whenever I saw you.

1019
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:23,929
I hope it heals soon.

1020
00:40:24,429 --> 00:40:25,429
Oh, what?

1021
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,059
(What's that?)

1022
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,269
Oh, my.

1023
00:40:30,099 --> 00:40:33,639
(Male Number 4 got her burn ointment.)

1024
00:40:33,739 --> 00:40:35,238
I actually have this at home.

1025
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:36,239
Is it?

1026
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:39,110
Is this for real? Wait a minute.

1027
00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:42,710
(A bit shy)

1028
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:43,780
Thank you.

1029
00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:51,489
"We're not that interested in each other."

1030
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,219
That was my notion of our relationship,

1031
00:40:55,889 --> 00:40:58,789
and I realized that I hadn't noticed his feelings.

1032
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,328
The dates are over.

1033
00:41:01,329 --> 00:41:02,329
I had fun.

1034
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:03,868
(The short five-minute date ends.)

1035
00:41:03,869 --> 00:41:05,269
I also had fun.

1036
00:41:05,369 --> 00:41:06,699
I'm feeling shy.

1037
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:10,340
(Female Number 10 returns to her seat.)

1038
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,879
I've been using this, and Male Number Four...

1039
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,980
- Who? - Number Four.

1040
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,349
He brought this for you?

1041
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:20,879
- Yes, and it's the one I'm using. - No way.

1042
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,920
What would he have done if you hadn't picked him?

1043
00:41:23,019 --> 00:41:25,050
I didn't think he'd pick me.

1044
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,489
I have bad instincts. I'm just bad at this.

1045
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,659
It was my first time having a stranger look after me.

1046
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,230
One more thing.

1047
00:41:35,231 --> 00:41:38,268
It's my first time having a good-looking stranger...

1048
00:41:38,269 --> 00:41:39,670
look after me.

1049
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,570
When I look at him,

1050
00:41:42,809 --> 00:41:44,840
my heart races...

1051
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,880
and it's hard to breathe.

1052
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,409
I don't know why.

1053
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,409
What do I do?

1054
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,420
(Women's waiting room before Round 3)

1055
00:41:56,519 --> 00:41:58,989
Are you thinking about picking the same one from last time?

1056
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,058
- The dermatologist? - Yes.

1057
00:42:01,059 --> 00:42:02,259
The one who can't lift heavy stuff?

1058
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,329
Yes, that's him.

1059
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:07,499
(I don't like thin and petty-looking lips.)

1060
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,570
Do my lips look petty?

1061
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,170
You can smile brightly,

1062
00:42:11,269 --> 00:42:12,429
so they're fine.

1063
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,939
(Smiling brightly)

1064
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,868
I've been going on dates with Male Number 24.

1065
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:20,038
(Female Number 23 went on a date with him in Round 2 as well.)

1066
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:21,509
(Going through the men's profiles)

1067
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:23,279
(She picks someone.)

1068
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,150
It's bad to have thin lips.

1069
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:27,179
He's the only one I remember.

1070
00:42:28,019 --> 00:42:29,420
Because of his petty-looking lips.

1071
00:42:30,289 --> 00:42:32,090
It's his upper lip.

1072
00:42:32,989 --> 00:42:34,519
He had a small mouth.

1073
00:42:35,059 --> 00:42:36,190
I'm torn.

1074
00:42:39,659 --> 00:42:40,659
Who should I pick?

1075
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:43,369
My choices are limited, you know.

1076
00:42:43,469 --> 00:42:45,529
"Who am I most interested in?"

1077
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:47,069
"Who am I curious about?"

1078
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:48,698
Those were my criteria.

1079
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:49,816
(She can't seem to decide on her date.)

1080
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,039
Who did you pick?

1081
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:53,808
I bet one of them is the dermatologist.

1082
00:42:53,809 --> 00:42:55,679
- Right? - I'm still deciding.

1083
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:58,349
I haven't written his number yet.

1084
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,479
Because I've already gone on two dates with him.

1085
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,178
Maybe I should pick someone else.

1086
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:04,339
(Female Number 23 is hesitant to pick Male Number 24.)

1087
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:09,219
(What's her choice?)

1088
00:43:09,389 --> 00:43:11,130
Male Number 24.

1089
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:12,389
The man who can't lift heavy things.

1090
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:15,059
Former national golfer and current dermatologist.

1091
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,570
He was one of the top three among men.

1092
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:18,928
He went on a date...

1093
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:21,800
with Female Number 23, a banker who only dealt with VIPs.

1094
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:23,939
- Both times? - Yes, both times.

1095
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,186
(Did Female Number 23 pick Male Number 23?)

1096
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:26,780
A lot of them are stepping forward.

1097
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,280
There's a lot.

1098
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:30,849
I was torn.

1099
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,879
(Female Number 23 is yet to show up.)

1100
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:36,889
Oh, my.

1101
00:43:36,949 --> 00:43:38,650
I was the last one to go to him.

1102
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:41,289
You came last.

1103
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:45,590
- Thank you. - I wanted him to remember me more.

1104
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:51,199
Let's begin the speed dating.

1105
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:54,639
- I'm here. - Hi.

1106
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,409
- Did you wait for me? - Of course.

1107
00:43:56,639 --> 00:43:58,239
You weren't coming to me, so...

1108
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:01,440
- You didn't think I'd come? - I was worried you wouldn't.

1109
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:03,210
I was holding myself back.

1110
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:04,849
I wanted to go last.

1111
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:06,479
The main character always arrives last.

1112
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,480
Of course.

1113
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:11,019
Your outfit is cute today.

1114
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:14,219
It looks good, right? I put a lot of thought into this.

1115
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:16,058
Did you?

1116
00:44:16,059 --> 00:44:17,130
(He's cute.)

1117
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:21,698
I wanted to look cute without being cold.

1118
00:44:21,699 --> 00:44:23,098
That was the idea.

1119
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:24,630
(Giggling)

1120
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:26,269
He's cute for some reason.

1121
00:44:26,369 --> 00:44:28,038
I'm not sure why, though.

1122
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:29,340
Why do I find him so cute?

1123
00:44:29,809 --> 00:44:31,669
I like those little items.

1124
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:35,139
Do you know the lettuce spinner?

1125
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:37,199
(Female Number 23's eyes are fixed on something.)

1126
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:39,279
- It spins when you push the button. - Yes.

1127
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,349
I love those.

1128
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:42,678
(She's focused on his lips)

1129
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:44,189
My first condition...

1130
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:46,619
was that I didn't like thin and petty-looking lips.

1131
00:44:48,289 --> 00:44:51,259
A person's preference is instinctive,

1132
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:54,030
so I think it's true when they say it doesn't change.

1133
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:59,739
But he had a small mouth.

1134
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:01,368
(Don't look at it.)

1135
00:45:01,369 --> 00:45:02,670
That was the toughest.

1136
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:06,880
(She couldn't concentrate until the end of the date.)

1137
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:09,140
You need to make up your mind now.

1138
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:11,010
I should.

1139
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:14,219
(Who else did you pick?)

1140
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:16,249
Me? Number Three.

1141
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:17,420
(Male Number 3)

1142
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:20,089
(Someone else had her ideal appearance.)

1143
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:23,159
He's my type.

1144
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:25,429
I was the most curious about Number Three.

1145
00:45:26,429 --> 00:45:29,159
So, Number Three was my first choice.

1146
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:32,729
(When she first saw him on the train in Round 1)

1147
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,238
(A corporate employee from a major Japanese company in Tokyo)

1148
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:35,816
(Annual income: Approximately 80,000 dollars)

1149
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,868
(His smile is pretty cute.)

1150
00:45:37,869 --> 00:45:40,340
I like men with pretty lips.

1151
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:43,209
And his mouth was beautiful when he smiled.

1152
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:45,679
(My choice is Number 8.)

1153
00:45:45,949 --> 00:45:49,519
(Male Number 3 went on a date with another woman.)

1154
00:45:49,889 --> 00:45:51,488
Oh, I wanted Number Three.

1155
00:45:51,489 --> 00:45:53,019
(She could only watch him go.)

1156
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,230
My usual type is...

1157
00:45:58,190 --> 00:45:59,599
Male Number Three.

1158
00:46:02,329 --> 00:46:03,369
This is tricky.

1159
00:46:05,469 --> 00:46:06,469
What do I do?

1160
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:08,499
(Male Number 3 got 5 votes.)

1161
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:09,510
What should I do?

1162
00:46:09,769 --> 00:46:12,880
I'm the most interested in Female Number 19.

1163
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:18,210
No way.

1164
00:46:18,679 --> 00:46:21,480
I had a good feeling the moment I saw her.

1165
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,020
I've been waiting for this day,

1166
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:26,989
and I hope I get a chance to talk to her more.

1167
00:46:30,389 --> 00:46:31,389
I should go.

1168
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:34,229
(Nervous)

1169
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:36,099
- Hello. - Hello.

1170
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,170
Hello.

1171
00:46:39,639 --> 00:46:42,570
(His first date is Female Number 23.)

1172
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:45,010
(Looking around)

1173
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:47,479
- Hello. - Hello.

1174
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:50,250
(Female Number 19 heads to Male Number 17)

1175
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:54,780
Looking at you from up close...

1176
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:56,820
- I seem different, right? - Yes.

1177
00:46:58,019 --> 00:46:59,819
(Too bad.)

1178
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:01,218
- Yes. - It's nice to meet you.

1179
00:47:01,219 --> 00:47:02,420
- Same here. - Hello.

1180
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:04,429
I've really wanted to talk to you.

1181
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:05,730
Really?

1182
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:08,800
I was very intrigued by your introduction.

1183
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,069
- Really? - Yes.

1184
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:11,829
I was so nervous at the time.

1185
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,239
I looked,

1186
00:47:14,869 --> 00:47:18,309
and I was the most interested in you.

1187
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:19,639
Oh, really?

1188
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:22,340
And you have a broad smile.

1189
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:26,250
(I don't like thin and petty-looking lips.)

1190
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:29,479
(Male Number 3's lips caught her attention.)

1191
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,948
You're my type.

1192
00:47:30,949 --> 00:47:32,219
(His lips are her type.)

1193
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:33,960
It was pretty direct.

1194
00:47:34,789 --> 00:47:37,429
It was a bit too much.

1195
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:40,259
(She complimented his lips 1 minute into the conversation.)

1196
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:41,260
I see.

1197
00:47:42,099 --> 00:47:43,800
I'm going to Tokyo the day after tomorrow.

1198
00:47:44,369 --> 00:47:46,768
- Oh, really? - Yes, I'm going on a solo trip.

1199
00:47:46,769 --> 00:47:47,800
(Flirting with him)

1200
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:50,309
But I'm briefly in Korea at the moment.

1201
00:47:51,309 --> 00:47:52,440
Really?

1202
00:47:54,139 --> 00:47:55,309
That's too bad.

1203
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:56,980
Where should I visit in Tokyo?

1204
00:47:57,579 --> 00:47:59,679
There are lots of good places in Tokyo.

1205
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,679
- I'll ask you next time. - Sure.

1206
00:48:02,949 --> 00:48:05,018
Do we still have time?

1207
00:48:05,019 --> 00:48:06,659
Can we talk more?

1208
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,389
But there are people waiting.

1209
00:48:09,889 --> 00:48:11,690
There are people waiting.

1210
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:16,130
Yes, so... Do you have any more questions for me?

1211
00:48:16,469 --> 00:48:18,299
You said last time...

1212
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:20,869
that you wanted to spend about three more years in Japan.

1213
00:48:20,969 --> 00:48:24,309
Yes, I'm still willing to build my career more.

1214
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,539
I can move to Japan.

1215
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:31,379
My company allows us to take a leave for two years.

1216
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:33,449
- Really? - So I could follow you.

1217
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:36,489
(He doesn't know how to react.)

1218
00:48:36,989 --> 00:48:38,189
I'm telling you I'm available.

1219
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:41,519
It feels like I'm on a blind date, and it's fun.

1220
00:48:41,989 --> 00:48:43,389
(Laughing)

1221
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:45,090
I was like, "What's going on?"

1222
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:46,530
I had a slight panic attack.

1223
00:48:47,159 --> 00:48:48,299
If we get a chance,

1224
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,469
- I'd like to talk more. - Yes.

1225
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:52,629
- I had so much fun. - All right.

1226
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:53,638
Thank you.

1227
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:54,639
- Thank you. - Yes.

1228
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,699
(She doesn't want to go.)

1229
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:58,768
- Hello. - Hi, Number Eight.

1230
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,649
(A beauty creator with 1.3 million subscribers)

1231
00:49:00,679 --> 00:49:02,110
Are we supposed to get in line?

1232
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:04,650
I think so.

1233
00:49:05,179 --> 00:49:07,320
- Thank you for picking me. - Don't mention it.

1234
00:49:08,019 --> 00:49:09,050
Ta-da.

1235
00:49:09,449 --> 00:49:11,618
(Filled with writing)

1236
00:49:11,619 --> 00:49:13,260
- What is that? - I wrote...

1237
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:15,360
some topics to talk about.

1238
00:49:17,389 --> 00:49:18,488
(She sincerely wrote them on her thumb.)

1239
00:49:18,489 --> 00:49:20,800
So, what type of food do you like?

1240
00:49:21,099 --> 00:49:23,000
Food? I prefer meat.

1241
00:49:23,369 --> 00:49:27,368
And are you okay with a long-distance relationship?

1242
00:49:27,369 --> 00:49:28,570
Have you ever been in one?

1243
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,670
How do you like to keep in touch?

1244
00:49:30,809 --> 00:49:33,440
What does looking out for someone mean to you?

1245
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:37,679
Why did you come all the way to Korea to look for your spouse?

1246
00:49:38,179 --> 00:49:39,678
There was so much writing...

1247
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:41,555
that I was worried she wouldn't be able to erase it.

1248
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:44,519
She wrote them on one of her fingers.

1249
00:49:44,789 --> 00:49:48,889
I had a long chat with her and her finger.

1250
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,429
- It was fun. - Thank you for your time.

1251
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,760
(The date with Female Number 8 ends as well.)

1252
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:57,099
(There's not much time left.)

1253
00:49:57,469 --> 00:49:59,269
(At that moment)

1254
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:01,440
Hello.

1255
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:03,239
Hello, Number 19.

1256
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:08,479
You looked so pure and innocent last time.

1257
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,279
Now that you're dressed in black...

1258
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,610
Yes, today...

1259
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:13,280
You look beautiful.

1260
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:15,420
You flatter me.

1261
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:16,420
(Shy)

1262
00:50:18,789 --> 00:50:20,558
You had such a long chat.

1263
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,018
Yes.

1264
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:25,190
She had a lot of questions for me.

1265
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:28,329
She even wrote them down.

1266
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:31,070
(Amazed)

1267
00:50:31,329 --> 00:50:32,729
I hope we also have a long chat.

1268
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:34,300
We've got time.

1269
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:37,110
But there's another one waiting in line.

1270
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:40,110
But she's not in line yet,

1271
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:44,379
so we can ask each other as many things as we like.

1272
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:45,409
Sure.

1273
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:47,078
Until we satisfy our curiosity.

1274
00:50:47,079 --> 00:50:48,519
I'd like to talk for a long time.

1275
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:54,718
(A bit displeased)

1276
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:57,059
I know that whoever I talked with...

1277
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,090
isn't my boyfriend or anything.

1278
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:01,299
But seeing him so happy...

1279
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,900
in front of someone else is annoying.

1280
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:06,070
Right now? You're annoyed?

1281
00:51:07,369 --> 00:51:09,839
I'd like a more detailed description...

1282
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:12,909
of your ideal type. That's my question.

1283
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,079
My ideal type is...

1284
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:19,179
someone who looks kind.

1285
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:22,449
Kind.

1286
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,050
Do I look kind?

1287
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,860
You look incredibly kind.

1288
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:31,789
I was bewitched.

1289
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,799
I think I felt something...

1290
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,159
that gave me conviction at that moment.

1291
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:38,599
I recently visited Japan.

1292
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:40,570
I'd love to go to Japan.

1293
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:43,269
You should come to Japan.

1294
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,538
Maybe in January.

1295
00:51:45,539 --> 00:51:47,638
If you need to make a reservation at a restaurant,

1296
00:51:47,639 --> 00:51:49,480
feel free to ask me.

1297
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:50,780
You should come.

1298
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:54,179
But I have friends in Japan, so...

1299
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:55,719
Oh, you have friends there.

1300
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:58,119
But they're couples.

1301
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,559
- So... - So, it's awkward.

1302
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,460
- I'm the third wheel. - Right.

1303
00:52:04,059 --> 00:52:07,999
I'm sure it'll be better to visit as a couple.

1304
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,030
Right.

1305
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:11,769
(Feeling shy)

1306
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:15,070
Maybe we can go on a double date.

1307
00:52:18,369 --> 00:52:22,679
He was shy, yet he said everything he wanted to.

1308
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:25,010
Number Three is my type.

1309
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,320
I liked the date with Number 19.

1310
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:30,389
But I'm a bit anxious.

1311
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:35,059
You may now ask them out.

1312
00:52:35,289 --> 00:52:36,630
Female Number 19.

1313
00:52:37,389 --> 00:52:38,429
- Number 19. - Wow.

1314
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,159
She's popular.

1315
00:52:41,429 --> 00:52:44,269
Female Number 19 was quite popular.

1316
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:47,800
She'll have a chance to talk to other men,

1317
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,908
and she may have a change of heart.

1318
00:52:49,909 --> 00:52:52,238
So, I guess I was pretty anxious about that.

1319
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:53,280
Thank you.

1320
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:55,840
She's so popular.

1321
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:58,079
This isn't going to work.

1322
00:52:58,849 --> 00:52:59,980
She's so popular.

1323
00:53:00,619 --> 00:53:01,819
How many requests did she get?

1324
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,119
Isn't she in first place?

1325
00:53:03,449 --> 00:53:05,420
She's popular. This is bad.

1326
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:10,530
If she says she likes someone else, what should I do?

1327
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:14,699
I can't predict anything that's coming.

1328
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:18,300
The women will be pretty nervous about being chosen.

1329
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:20,300
(Meanwhile, )

1330
00:53:20,301 --> 00:53:22,840
(one woman is staring at one man.)

1331
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:25,009
(Who is she staring at?)

1332
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:27,009
The innocent oral surgeon.

1333
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:28,730
He was also one of the top three among men.

1334
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:29,909
Oh, the Pump It Up!

1335
00:53:30,909 --> 00:53:34,380
It seemed that Male Number 7 already had his pick.

1336
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,250
They made such a good couple...

1337
00:53:37,489 --> 00:53:39,448
that everyone knew about them.

1338
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:41,236
(Female Number 18 and Male Number 7 are already known as a match.)

1339
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:42,960
On our first date,

1340
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:45,288
I got the impression that we had...

1341
00:53:45,289 --> 00:53:47,000
compatible tendencies and good chemistry.

1342
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:49,329
(I want an anime and video game geek.)

1343
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,868
Do you like Pump It Up?

1344
00:53:53,869 --> 00:53:55,569
(Laughing)

1345
00:53:55,570 --> 00:53:57,869
I love Pump It Up.

1346
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:02,780
How can this be?

1347
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:06,179
On our first date, there was a spark between us.

1348
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,449
Others asked me if I was interested in anyone,

1349
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:12,849
and my only answer was Female Number 18.

1350
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:15,860
- Who was your first pick? - Mine was Female Number 18.

1351
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:17,690
Who did you pick?

1352
00:54:18,059 --> 00:54:19,260
I picked Female Number 18.

1353
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:20,629
Who's your first pick?

1354
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:22,000
It's Male Number Seven.

1355
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,069
I hear wedding bells.

1356
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:25,368
(Female Number 18 had the same feeling.)

1357
00:54:25,369 --> 00:54:26,570
I hear them right now.

1358
00:54:26,769 --> 00:54:28,445
I'm planning to go on a honeymoon next year.

1359
00:54:28,469 --> 00:54:30,169
- What? - She planned it all out.

1360
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:31,170
Where to?

1361
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:32,768
Are you going straight to her today?

1362
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:33,809
Today? You bet.

1363
00:54:34,409 --> 00:54:35,439
You're so cool.

1364
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,149
We made a promise during our last chat.

1365
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:40,879
We promised to watch each other's favorite anime...

1366
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,149
before today.

1367
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:43,518
That's awesome.

1368
00:54:43,519 --> 00:54:45,359
I'm going to check if she actually watched it.

1369
00:54:45,389 --> 00:54:47,158
That's so lovey-dovey.

1370
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:48,159
(It's already too sweet between them.)

1371
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,190
Who am I excited to meet?

1372
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:53,659
Just Female Number 18.

1373
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:56,059
Male Number Seven.

1374
00:54:57,070 --> 00:54:59,000
(Standing up)

1375
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,369
I thought, "It's time."

1376
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,170
I was so excited to see her.

1377
00:55:03,969 --> 00:55:05,939
My heart fluttered.

1378
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:07,686
(His heart flutters, thinking about talking to her again.)

1379
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:09,839
- Hello. - Hi.

1380
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,010
How have you been?

1381
00:55:11,409 --> 00:55:13,049
The week went by so fast.

1382
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:14,178
Right? Me too.

1383
00:55:14,179 --> 00:55:15,780
- It went by so fast. - Exactly.

1384
00:55:16,019 --> 00:55:18,190
After I got off work on weekdays,

1385
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:20,310
I was like, "I should watch the anime."

1386
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:22,289
- Did you watch it? - I did.

1387
00:55:22,789 --> 00:55:23,789
- Seriously? - Yes.

1388
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:25,989
- Which one? - "Fullmetal Alchemist."

1389
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:27,439
How much of it have you watched?

1390
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:31,169
Only the beginning. I think it was Episode 13 or 14.

1391
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:32,230
Well, that's...

1392
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,600
- So... - Still, that's a lot.

1393
00:55:34,369 --> 00:55:35,439
I tried.

1394
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,738
I watched it in my spare time.

1395
00:55:36,739 --> 00:55:38,610
(You're so cute.)

1396
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,109
(Feeling somewhat proud)

1397
00:55:41,110 --> 00:55:44,210
They asked me so much about you.

1398
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:46,279
- Who did? - Other women.

1399
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,449
Did they?

1400
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,848
They say that we seem like a confirmed couple.

1401
00:55:49,849 --> 00:55:50,889
Really?

1402
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:53,419
They said that they couldn't see...

1403
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:55,190
an opportunity to talk to you.

1404
00:55:56,659 --> 00:55:59,929
I felt bad. For you, I mean.

1405
00:56:00,829 --> 00:56:03,730
You might want to get to know other women.

1406
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:06,400
But I'm...

1407
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,399
- terrible at multitasking. - Oh, right.

1408
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,809
I'm a total racehorse.

1409
00:56:11,739 --> 00:56:12,739
So,

1410
00:56:13,579 --> 00:56:14,639
you don't...

1411
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,449
You don't need to feel that way.

1412
00:56:18,949 --> 00:56:21,178
- You're pretty daring. - Am I?

1413
00:56:21,179 --> 00:56:22,519
Are you a straightforward type?

1414
00:56:22,619 --> 00:56:24,119
- Totally. - Really?

1415
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:26,150
- I have a question for you. - Yes?

1416
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:28,920
You're Number Seven, right?

1417
00:56:29,059 --> 00:56:31,789
When was your last relationship?

1418
00:56:32,929 --> 00:56:34,299
- It's been 2 years. - It's been 2 years?

1419
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,559
A little over two years.

1420
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:38,129
- Don't you have any women around? - No.

1421
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:39,199
- Really? - No.

1422
00:56:39,699 --> 00:56:41,170
- I have none. - You get a pass.

1423
00:56:41,699 --> 00:56:42,840
I have no one.

1424
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:49,979
Doctors usually date other doctors.

1425
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,909
They spend the whole day together.

1426
00:56:53,179 --> 00:56:55,019
But there aren't any women.

1427
00:56:56,119 --> 00:56:57,190
I like that.

1428
00:56:58,219 --> 00:57:01,789
Fifteen minutes have gone by.

1429
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:03,760
We're fine.

1430
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:06,828
I wrote someone else's number too.

1431
00:57:06,829 --> 00:57:08,230
I picked another one too.

1432
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:10,169
But you don't have a choice. I also picked someone else.

1433
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:11,170
Right.

1434
00:57:11,171 --> 00:57:12,900
I'm going to see who you pick.

1435
00:57:14,199 --> 00:57:15,199
I saw you too.

1436
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:19,440
I was watching who you were picking.

1437
00:57:19,639 --> 00:57:21,010
I'm sure you'll have a good time.

1438
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:24,078
- What if it's too good? - What?

1439
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:26,448
- What if the date goes too well? - That's no good.

1440
00:57:26,449 --> 00:57:27,519
(No.)

1441
00:57:28,849 --> 00:57:30,150
I'm kidding.

1442
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:32,349
- This is so interesting. - What is?

1443
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:36,059
We were able to be more certain about each other.

1444
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:39,360
I realized that she liked me more than I expected.

1445
00:57:39,659 --> 00:57:41,630
It was nicer.

1446
00:57:41,829 --> 00:57:43,929
How should I describe how happy I am?

1447
00:57:45,769 --> 00:57:47,869
He said that he would only have eyes for me.

1448
00:57:48,199 --> 00:57:50,570
I was over the moon. And it was cool.

1449
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:54,379
(A short break)

1450
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:55,609
Who did you pick?

1451
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:56,949
Number 18.

1452
00:57:57,050 --> 00:57:59,110
- You went on two dates with her? - Yes.

1453
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:02,679
What kind of person do you think she is?

1454
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,489
She seems nice.

1455
00:58:05,489 --> 00:58:07,389
I like a woman who knows what she wants.

1456
00:58:07,719 --> 00:58:10,189
(Male Number 24 is interested in Female Number 18?)

1457
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:11,989
(Round 2, the ladies' speed train)

1458
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:14,459
(Female Number 18 had a unique condition for marriage.)

1459
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:16,130
(Male Number 24 cheered when he saw it.)

1460
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:18,569
Then, we can stay at home the whole time.

1461
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:20,268
We can play video games and watch anime.

1462
00:58:20,269 --> 00:58:21,940
That's a good condition.

1463
00:58:22,369 --> 00:58:25,038
She talked about anime and video games.

1464
00:58:25,039 --> 00:58:28,109
People usually find it difficult to bring that up.

1465
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:30,349
She seemed more attractive...

1466
00:58:30,449 --> 00:58:32,280
that she knew what she wanted.

1467
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:35,250
I was just curious about her.

1468
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:38,689
I wasn't doing anything bad.

1469
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:40,850
I thought I could have a simple conversation with her.

1470
00:58:42,289 --> 00:58:44,888
I'd like to talk with her, too.

1471
00:58:44,889 --> 00:58:46,229
- Who? - Her.

1472
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:48,106
(18: Pharmacist wanting to become the husband's queen supporter)

1473
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:49,399
- All right. - Okay.

1474
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,469
Let's see how it goes.

1475
00:58:54,039 --> 00:58:55,099
Go ahead.

1476
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:57,969
Hi.

1477
00:58:58,110 --> 00:58:59,968
Don't tell me Number Seven will beat me up.

1478
00:58:59,969 --> 00:59:01,840
No, it'll be okay.

1479
00:59:01,909 --> 00:59:04,609
Number Seven threatened me, saying, "I dare you to."

1480
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:05,750
- Really? - Yes.

1481
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:10,150
I was watching them.

1482
00:59:11,489 --> 00:59:13,420
(Female Number 18 studies the profile card.)

1483
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:16,719
"I can't carry heavy things."

1484
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:20,699
I'm not just trying to be funny.

1485
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,999
I really hate carrying heavy things.

1486
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,328
I'm good at carrying heavy things.

1487
00:59:24,329 --> 00:59:25,799
I see. Thank you.

1488
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,098
That's...

1489
00:59:27,099 --> 00:59:28,138
(Laughing)

1490
00:59:28,139 --> 00:59:30,308
Actually, I was good at it.

1491
00:59:30,309 --> 00:59:32,339
But I sprained myself at the gym.

1492
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:34,440
Then we can use a cart.

1493
00:59:35,179 --> 00:59:37,980
I'll prepare a really nice cart.

1494
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:41,319
Don't we have to pick it up to put it on the cart?

1495
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,380
Using the principle of leverage, I'll use my foot.

1496
00:59:43,650 --> 00:59:46,149
I'll use my foot.

1497
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:47,820
Are you being efficient or lazy?

1498
00:59:47,989 --> 00:59:49,889
It's both.

1499
00:59:50,489 --> 00:59:53,158
They say the lazy ones are smart.

1500
00:59:53,159 --> 00:59:54,859
(Just looking at each other makes them laugh.)

1501
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:57,029
It's weird but convincing.

1502
00:59:57,030 --> 01:00:00,098
I feel like you'll be able to sell goods well.

1503
01:00:00,099 --> 01:00:03,598
Even with water, I have to buy the 500ml bottled ones.

1504
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:06,868
It has to be next to my desk or where I always lie down.

1505
01:00:06,869 --> 01:00:08,280
Is it a slight obsession?

1506
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,078
- It's not an obsession. - No?

1507
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:11,280
I just get thirsty.

1508
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:13,309
I get thirsty.

1509
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:17,919
It's because I get thirsty.

1510
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,250
(Crying from laughing too much)

1511
01:00:20,489 --> 01:00:22,320
I didn't expect that.

1512
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,789
Things look good between them. But is it that funny?

1513
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:28,130
- It's not funny at all. - Right?

1514
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:29,759
(One man is not happy at all.)

1515
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:30,929
What are they talking about?

1516
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,539
It seems like they're talking about something funny.

1517
01:00:38,539 --> 01:00:40,909
Talking with Number 24...

1518
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:43,679
seemed fun for her.

1519
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:47,119
This is very cruel.

1520
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:50,019
(Feeling gloomy)

1521
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:51,948
Are you always this hilarious?

1522
01:00:51,949 --> 01:00:54,659
- No. I only stated the obvious. - Really?

1523
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:56,959
But everything you say is so funny.

1524
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,558
- That was hilarious. - Good.

1525
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:01,899
- My ideal type is a funny guy. - Is that so?

1526
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:03,630
I think I could do it.

1527
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:06,799
Me drinking water makes you laugh.

1528
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:10,610
Making you laugh doesn't seem all that hard.

1529
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:13,409
(She burst into another laughter.)

1530
01:01:13,809 --> 01:01:14,939
You're so funny.

1531
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:17,249
It's been 15 minutes.

1532
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:18,379
- I see. - We better stop talking.

1533
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:19,848
- Really? - Or I might get scolded.

1534
01:01:19,849 --> 01:01:20,979
Right.

1535
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:22,749
- Okay. It was fun. - I had fun.

1536
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:23,919
Let's talk a lot.

1537
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,219
- Sure. - Great.

1538
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:28,058
He made me laugh so much.

1539
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:29,788
(Male Number 24)

1540
01:01:29,789 --> 01:01:32,129
Fifteen minutes was too short.

1541
01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:33,929
I wanted to talk to him longer.

1542
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:37,098
(After the fun conversation with Male Number 24)

1543
01:01:37,099 --> 01:01:38,630
I'll go now.

1544
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,199
I can finally talk to her. Gosh.

1545
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:42,869
- Hi. - Hi.

1546
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:45,139
- I'm finally able to talk to you. - Is that so?

1547
01:01:45,639 --> 01:01:48,679
- By any chance, among the idols, - Yes?

1548
01:01:48,909 --> 01:01:51,779
- do you know Baek Ji Heon? - Yes.

1549
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:52,808
- Have you heard... - No.

1550
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:54,049
- that you two look alike? - No.

1551
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:55,050
- When you smile... - It's a first.

1552
01:01:55,051 --> 01:01:56,518
Really? You look a lot like her when you smile.

1553
01:01:56,519 --> 01:01:58,788
That's such an honor. I'm a huge fan of hers.

1554
01:01:58,789 --> 01:01:59,848
- Is that so? - Yes.

1555
01:01:59,849 --> 01:02:01,420
- Isn't she pretty? - Yes, she is.

1556
01:02:01,659 --> 01:02:03,158
- Do you like Baek Ji Heon? - I do.

1557
01:02:03,159 --> 01:02:05,788
Really? You have a really nice voice.

1558
01:02:05,789 --> 01:02:06,888
- Me? - Yes.

1559
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:07,960
Thank you.

1560
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:09,860
What do I do?

1561
01:02:09,861 --> 01:02:11,098
(Feeling complicated)

1562
01:02:11,099 --> 01:02:12,900
Time is passing by too slowly.

1563
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,300
Time is passing so slowly.

1564
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:20,639
At first, I was going to stick...

1565
01:02:21,809 --> 01:02:23,440
with Number Seven.

1566
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:28,218
But I started to waver.

1567
01:02:28,219 --> 01:02:29,619
There's been a change.

1568
01:02:31,889 --> 01:02:33,719
Usually, it starts in those situations.

1569
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:36,820
There was one in the previous season.

1570
01:02:36,989 --> 01:02:39,059
"We almost went on a blind date."

1571
01:02:39,789 --> 01:02:42,999
(We almost went on a blind date.)

1572
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:47,539
(The 5-minute conversation brought about...)

1573
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:49,099
Will you...

1574
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,610
(an unexpected love story between Kwon Young Jin and Eun Ye Sol.)

1575
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:54,309
In just five minutes.

1576
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,279
That had happened before.

1577
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:00,920
(What result will the short moments bring about?)

1578
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:06,618
(Meanwhile, )

1579
01:03:06,619 --> 01:03:08,259
(Male Number 26 is unable to smile.)

1580
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:09,820
I'm extremely worried.

1581
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:12,928
(26: The DJing patent attorney slash attorney)

1582
01:03:12,929 --> 01:03:16,099
(In the previous round, who appeared before Male Number 26 was...)

1583
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,129
(Female Number 9, hoping for a 2 million dollar home.)

1584
01:03:18,130 --> 01:03:22,368
(9: An open-minded Samsung worker who studied abroad)

1585
01:03:22,369 --> 01:03:25,039
I don't want to live in a place worth less than that.

1586
01:03:25,269 --> 01:03:29,939
(The two became a match in Round 2.)

1587
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:32,879
The man simply needs the ability to buy...

1588
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,649
a 2-million-dollar property?

1589
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:35,979
All I need is the potential.

1590
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:38,150
- I'm confident. - That's all I need.

1591
01:03:38,349 --> 01:03:40,018
(With Male Number 26's confident words, )

1592
01:03:40,019 --> 01:03:41,619
(the two confirmed their feelings.)

1593
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:45,389
I'm extremely worried.

1594
01:03:45,659 --> 01:03:47,029
Hi.

1595
01:03:47,030 --> 01:03:48,899
(Who did Female Number 9 pick first?)

1596
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:50,928
- You're very popular. - Gosh.

1597
01:03:50,929 --> 01:03:52,399
(It's Male Number 11 with a 500,000 dollar annual salary)

1598
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:53,868
(and a million-dollar asset.)

1599
01:03:53,869 --> 01:03:56,800
If it's a home worth over two million dollars,

1600
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:58,010
is it in Incheon?

1601
01:03:58,510 --> 01:03:59,768
Rather than...

1602
01:03:59,769 --> 01:04:03,738
living in a two-million-dollar house right away,

1603
01:04:03,739 --> 01:04:06,480
I prefer a man with such an ability.

1604
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:08,380
I have the ability.

1605
01:04:09,079 --> 01:04:10,749
That's amazing.

1606
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:14,019
I have a clear condition.

1607
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:17,288
But there aren't many men who can satisfy...

1608
01:04:17,289 --> 01:04:18,729
that condition.

1609
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:20,899
I have a niche market.

1610
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,360
(Targeting the niche market)

1611
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:24,900
(He can't help but watch her.)

1612
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:27,469
- You're looking for a grand home. - Yes.

1613
01:04:27,639 --> 01:04:28,698
Must it be in Songdo?

1614
01:04:28,699 --> 01:04:31,139
I don't think many houses there are over two million dollars.

1615
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:33,539
I have to live in Seoul.

1616
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:35,408
Even my hospital is in Seoul.

1617
01:04:35,409 --> 01:04:38,549
Without a doubt, I'm financially stable.

1618
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:39,550
I see.

1619
01:04:39,551 --> 01:04:41,031
(Her dates have overwhelming wealth.)

1620
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:43,019
(Sighing)

1621
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:45,190
My head hurts.

1622
01:04:45,550 --> 01:04:48,360
"There are lots of incredible men," was what I thought.

1623
01:04:48,519 --> 01:04:51,429
But my stress level also shot up.

1624
01:04:51,789 --> 01:04:53,589
I didn't feel at ease.

1625
01:04:53,590 --> 01:04:54,799
(Salary: 500,000 dollars, Assets: 5 million dollars)

1626
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:55,999
(Salary: 120,000 dollars)

1627
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,345
(Salary: 500,000 dollars, Assets: 1 million dollars)

1628
01:04:57,369 --> 01:04:59,399
(At that moment, she approaches Male Number 26.)

1629
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:00,400
(Feeling disturbed)

1630
01:05:00,699 --> 01:05:02,300
Hi.

1631
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:05,268
You're wearing a different outfit today.

1632
01:05:05,269 --> 01:05:06,269
Yes. What do you think?

1633
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:08,710
It's pretty. But...

1634
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:11,750
Don't you have to button it up?

1635
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:14,480
Should I talk with my jacket like this?

1636
01:05:14,949 --> 01:05:16,319
It looks weird.

1637
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:17,788
- My bad. - It looks better worn properly.

1638
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:19,849
You have such a nice build.

1639
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:22,989
By the way...

1640
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:24,788
Yes?

1641
01:05:24,789 --> 01:05:27,730
This part keeps grabbing my attention.

1642
01:05:27,929 --> 01:05:28,929
Which part?

1643
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:31,400
- Which one? - Two million dollars.

1644
01:05:31,769 --> 01:05:33,469
Didn't you have the confidence?

1645
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:34,739
Even so...

1646
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:38,409
Two million dollars is not easy.

1647
01:05:38,610 --> 01:05:39,639
No, it's not.

1648
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:44,550
You picked other men, right?

1649
01:05:45,309 --> 01:05:46,679
What were the criteria?

1650
01:05:47,550 --> 01:05:51,649
Someone who can provide the financial stability I want...

1651
01:05:51,650 --> 01:05:53,050
in the future.

1652
01:05:53,219 --> 01:05:55,489
That was my first criterion.

1653
01:05:56,289 --> 01:05:59,289
It was like he had no confidence.

1654
01:05:59,389 --> 01:06:02,129
He kept asking with what criteria...

1655
01:06:02,130 --> 01:06:04,670
I chose the first two men.

1656
01:06:05,099 --> 01:06:07,869
That side of him made me ponder.

1657
01:06:08,139 --> 01:06:10,599
It's like I'm being interviewed right now.

1658
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:11,739
By me?

1659
01:06:18,809 --> 01:06:21,419
Did you do some thinking over the weekend?

1660
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:22,980
Do you have any questions for me?

1661
01:06:23,349 --> 01:06:27,419
I did think about what I wanted to talk about...

1662
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:28,959
to you, Number Nine.

1663
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:31,129
- About wine? - No, "Number Nine."

1664
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:32,289
Oh, Number Nine...

1665
01:06:32,789 --> 01:06:36,399
- I'm quite bad at listening. - It's okay.

1666
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,729
So you thought about me. That's nice.

1667
01:06:38,730 --> 01:06:40,800
- Of course, I did. - Same here.

1668
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,369
Let's see.

1669
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:46,139
(Here comes Female Number 9's question parade)

1670
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:47,979
What's your original ideal type?

1671
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:50,309
What do you consider the most important in a partner?

1672
01:06:50,409 --> 01:06:53,678
(Is this a deja vu of the previous date?)

1673
01:06:53,679 --> 01:06:57,388
I like alpha males.

1674
01:06:57,389 --> 01:06:58,449
I see.

1675
01:06:58,590 --> 01:06:59,619
Are you an alpha?

1676
01:07:00,690 --> 01:07:05,288
I'm not sure I can say so myself.

1677
01:07:05,289 --> 01:07:07,329
But you seem like one.

1678
01:07:08,030 --> 01:07:09,630
Does that mean you're an alpha female?

1679
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,570
You're quite cute, aren't you?

1680
01:07:12,630 --> 01:07:16,739
You're slightly off the wall, and I find that charming.

1681
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:21,509
Even if I become a big shot in the future,

1682
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:24,780
I will be attracted to someone much better than me.

1683
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:28,449
I'm not talking about looks. Look-wise, I'm...

1684
01:07:29,019 --> 01:07:32,250
I'll always maintain a hot body.

1685
01:07:33,789 --> 01:07:35,618
(Male Number 26 ends up falling apart.)

1686
01:07:35,619 --> 01:07:38,859
You were so confident last time. What happened?

1687
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:40,759
Do I not look confident anymore?

1688
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:43,558
Yes. What happened during the one week?

1689
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:45,969
I'm still confident.

1690
01:07:46,670 --> 01:07:48,800
I like that confident side of you.

1691
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:52,369
When it comes to men, confidence is essential.

1692
01:07:52,769 --> 01:07:54,908
I'm not talking about useless confidence.

1693
01:07:54,909 --> 01:07:56,780
Specifically...

1694
01:07:57,449 --> 01:07:58,550
He wasn't bad at all.

1695
01:08:00,579 --> 01:08:01,739
Will we see each other again?

1696
01:08:02,519 --> 01:08:03,820
Do you think we will?

1697
01:08:04,119 --> 01:08:06,889
If we don't, I'll sulk really badly.

1698
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,118
See you later.

1699
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:12,159
(What will happen to Male Number 26 and Female Number 9?)

1700
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:15,860
(4 hours later)

1701
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:20,599
Starting now, the finalists...

1702
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:23,140
to join the Palace Week will be confirmed.

1703
01:08:26,409 --> 01:08:28,408
If you have made up your mind,

1704
01:08:28,409 --> 01:08:32,210
please step forward and call out their number.

1705
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:35,579
Me!

1706
01:08:36,079 --> 01:08:37,079
(She's so cool.)

1707
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:38,519
Who's she going to call?

1708
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:39,988
- Number Ten. - It's you.

1709
01:08:39,989 --> 01:08:41,189
(Number 10's matching partner)

1710
01:08:41,590 --> 01:08:42,759
It's as if she was waiting.

1711
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:44,829
(Female Number 10 walks up to the matching zone.)

1712
01:08:44,890 --> 01:08:47,289
My whole body was shaking.

1713
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:49,358
Please call out the number of the one...

1714
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:51,000
you want to go to the Palace Week with.

1715
01:08:51,329 --> 01:08:53,699
The one I want to go with is...

1716
01:08:54,670 --> 01:08:57,239
Number Four.

1717
01:08:57,539 --> 01:08:59,840
She called out Male Number Four.

1718
01:09:00,569 --> 01:09:02,010
They're an unquestionable couple.

1719
01:09:02,739 --> 01:09:04,209
(The two meet again at the matching zone.)

1720
01:09:04,210 --> 01:09:05,579
I'm so nervous.

1721
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:08,550
I was nervous.

1722
01:09:08,779 --> 01:09:09,779
Oh, what?

1723
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:11,390
Oh, my.

1724
01:09:11,890 --> 01:09:15,590
I wanted to express how touched I was.

1725
01:09:19,029 --> 01:09:21,930
Will you go to the Fashion... Fashion?

1726
01:09:24,159 --> 01:09:25,359
Are you going to Fashion Week?

1727
01:09:25,569 --> 01:09:26,569
Fashion Week is nice.

1728
01:09:26,869 --> 01:09:28,345
- Fashion Week. - Fashion Week is amazing.

1729
01:09:28,369 --> 01:09:29,369
It's popular.

1730
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:32,270
I'll stop laughing and look into it.

1731
01:09:32,439 --> 01:09:36,039
Will you go to the Palace Week with me?

1732
01:09:36,979 --> 01:09:37,979
That was cute.

1733
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:42,020
(She's looking forward to it.)

1734
01:09:42,119 --> 01:09:47,090
(Male Number 4 is unable to give an answer right away.)

1735
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:50,890
What? What's with that troubled look?

1736
01:09:53,159 --> 01:09:54,759
Thank you for mustering up your courage.

1737
01:09:56,729 --> 01:09:59,669
(The result will be revealed in 60 seconds.)

1738
01:09:59,670 --> 01:10:00,670
What now?

1739
01:10:00,671 --> 01:10:02,869
(The result will be revealed in 60 seconds.)

1740
01:10:05,609 --> 01:10:09,039
Will you go to the Palace Week with me?

1741
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:11,010
That was cute.

1742
01:10:12,109 --> 01:10:14,010
Thank you for mustering up your courage.

1743
01:10:16,279 --> 01:10:17,818
(What's going on?)

1744
01:10:17,819 --> 01:10:18,890
Thank you.

1745
01:10:19,850 --> 01:10:21,219
I'll join you.

1746
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:23,419
(I'll join you in Palace Week.)

1747
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:24,590
What was that?

1748
01:10:24,829 --> 01:10:26,358
He knows how to put on a show.

1749
01:10:26,359 --> 01:10:27,489
Seriously.

1750
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:28,800
He scared me.

1751
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,328
(Male Number 4 and Female Number 10 enter Palace Week.)

1752
01:10:30,329 --> 01:10:31,829
- Thank you. - Is your hand okay?

1753
01:10:34,869 --> 01:10:37,609
Did I thank you for the medicine?

1754
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:39,470
Oh, that?

1755
01:10:39,471 --> 01:10:41,278
I didn't even thank you for it.

1756
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:45,109
- It's okay. - That's why I took the courage...

1757
01:10:45,779 --> 01:10:47,049
- Is that so? - to tell you.

1758
01:10:47,050 --> 01:10:48,970
(Si Yeon plucked up her courage for Hyun Joong.)

1759
01:10:50,319 --> 01:10:52,789
You're the pharmacist, right?

1760
01:10:52,890 --> 01:10:55,020
The one who likes games and animations.

1761
01:10:55,789 --> 01:10:57,319
Where's Number 18's date partner?

1762
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:58,729
Oh, it's you.

1763
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:01,859
- It's me, right? - Yes.

1764
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:03,060
I hope it's me.

1765
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:06,000
We had two dates today.

1766
01:11:06,199 --> 01:11:07,429
I was convinced...

1767
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:08,970
that we got along well.

1768
01:11:09,369 --> 01:11:11,609
On the other hand, I was quite anxious.

1769
01:11:12,569 --> 01:11:14,709
Talking with Number 24.

1770
01:11:14,710 --> 01:11:15,978
(During the date with Male Number 24)

1771
01:11:15,979 --> 01:11:20,180
(Female Number 18 seemed happy.)

1772
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:21,479
She looked happy.

1773
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:23,850
He was my biggest competition.

1774
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:27,689
Who do you want to go to Palace Week with?

1775
01:11:28,819 --> 01:11:31,529
The one I want to go to Palace Week with is...

1776
01:11:34,359 --> 01:11:37,199
I've always liked funny men.

1777
01:11:38,069 --> 01:11:41,470
(Male Number 24 seemed to crack her up.)

1778
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,568
(Male Number 13 had many things in common.)

1779
01:11:43,569 --> 01:11:45,569
I had second thoughts.

1780
01:11:47,810 --> 01:11:50,479
The one I want to go to Palace Week with is...

1781
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,909
(The 2 men made Female Number 18 waver.)

1782
01:11:54,550 --> 01:11:58,850
(The result will be revealed in 60 seconds.)

1783
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:03,590
The one I want to go to Palace Week with is...

1784
01:12:03,989 --> 01:12:06,960
(The 2 men made Female Number 18 waver.)

1785
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:09,300
(And one man only has eyes on her.)

1786
01:12:09,699 --> 01:12:13,729
Male Number Seven.

1787
01:12:15,939 --> 01:12:17,659
(Male Number 7 heads to the matching zone.)

1788
01:12:18,710 --> 01:12:21,810
It felt like I hadn't seen all of Number Seven's charms.

1789
01:12:22,479 --> 01:12:24,579
I wanted to get to know him more.

1790
01:12:26,409 --> 01:12:28,880
You said you liked girls who give off a good feeling.

1791
01:12:28,979 --> 01:12:32,250
I'll make you feel it more during Palace Week.

1792
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:34,590
(His heart is fluttering.)

1793
01:12:34,789 --> 01:12:35,989
How sweet.

1794
01:12:36,659 --> 01:12:37,729
Okay. Let's go together.

1795
01:12:40,289 --> 01:12:42,429
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

1796
01:12:42,430 --> 01:12:44,630
(Male Number 7 and Female Number 18 enter Palace Week.)

1797
01:12:45,430 --> 01:12:50,439
Things have gone smoothly with her, who hit the right note...

1798
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,408
the moment we first met.

1799
01:12:52,409 --> 01:12:53,409
It's to the point it made me think...

1800
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:56,010
things were progressing too smoothly.

1801
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,750
- Do you want some thrill? - Thrill? No.

1802
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:01,380
I've had enough dopamine.

1803
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:04,619
Did the obvious development make it boring?

1804
01:13:08,319 --> 01:13:10,039
I'll put in some effort starting next week.

1805
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:12,028
(Pretending like he heard nothing)

1806
01:13:12,029 --> 01:13:13,029
I'm just joking.

1807
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:14,500
I like the obvious.

1808
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,170
I hope the obviousness continues.

1809
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:20,729
(The never-ending speed date)

1810
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:22,969
(Fixing a wedding date first?)

1811
01:13:22,970 --> 01:13:24,269
(What's your ideal type?)

1812
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:25,270
(I like a pleasant face.)

1813
01:13:25,310 --> 01:13:26,310
(I have a pleasant face.)

1814
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:28,640
(Can she find her partner?)

1815
01:13:28,909 --> 01:13:29,909
(The finalists...)

1816
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:31,908
(to join the Palace Week will be confirmed.)

1817
01:13:31,909 --> 01:13:33,108
(Obtaining love...)

1818
01:13:33,109 --> 01:13:34,819
(faster than anyone else!)

1819
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:35,920
(Let's go.)

1820
01:13:35,921 --> 01:13:37,278
(Let's go walk the rosy path.)

1821
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:38,349
(Will you go with me?)

1822
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:39,366
(Which couples will get matched?)

1823
01:13:39,390 --> 01:13:40,850
(The long-awaited Palace Week)

1824
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:42,720
(The additional residents will enter.)

1825
01:13:42,819 --> 01:13:43,979
(The female catfish appears?)

1826
01:13:44,289 --> 01:13:45,289
(A secret date)

1827
01:13:45,289 --> 01:13:46,289
(Send an invitation to the other gender.)

1828
01:13:46,290 --> 01:13:47,459
(I'm going to write it.)

1829
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:49,529
(I'll drag you down!)

1830
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:50,920
(She wanted to challenge me.)

1831
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:52,100
(What do I do?)

1832
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:54,099
(I'll play like a thug.)

1833
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:55,538
(Nothing is definite before the wedding.)

1834
01:13:55,539 --> 01:13:56,738
(I must drag her down.)

1835
01:13:56,739 --> 01:13:58,509
(I'm quite mean. Can you handle it?)

1836
01:13:58,510 --> 01:13:59,769
(Why must I become self-conscious?)

1837
01:13:59,770 --> 01:14:00,839
(It's infuriating.)

1838
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:02,438
(What? This is wrong.)

1839
01:14:02,439 --> 01:14:04,339
(We have similar tastes.)

1840
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:05,349
(Isn't that too much?)

1841
01:14:05,350 --> 01:14:07,150
(I don't want what's mine to get taken away.)
