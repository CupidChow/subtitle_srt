1
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:12,979
(COUPLE PALACE 2)

2
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,289
The romantic interests are...

3
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,659
- reaching the climax. - I know.

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,529
Last week, Sin Da and Jung Won...

5
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,060
moved to the couple zone.

6
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,799
And Ha Yeon told Jung Won...

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,870
about Sin Da and Ji Woong.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,230
Right, that happened.

9
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,339
Sin Da applied for a secret date...

10
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,200
as soon as she arrived in the couple zone.

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,310
That was shocking.

12
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,410
It's crazy in the single zone too.

13
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,509
Right. Jae Yeon...

14
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,279
- wants Joo Hee. - Yes.

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,419
- Joo Hee wants Sang Gyeong. - It's complicated.

16
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,149
And Sang Gyeong wants Jin Ju.

17
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,820
- What is going on? - What are they going to do?

18
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,859
Jae Keun also only voted for Jin Ju.

19
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,459
- He did. - Yet, Jin Ju...

20
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,359
- voted for both of them. - Yes.

21
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,689
That's what makes it complicated.

22
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,299
- She should have picked one. - Yes.

23
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,669
We have one more thing that's unpredictable.

24
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,629
Some of the potential proposal vote results...

25
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,469
- haven't been revealed yet. - No.

26
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:08,140
Hye Won's result isn't revealed yet.

27
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,670
(Everyone's curious about Hye Won's choice.)

28
00:01:09,671 --> 00:01:12,040
And I'm most curious about who she chose.

29
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,509
Hye Won misunderstood Jae Keun.

30
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:15,510
Yes.

31
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:19,019
(Hye Won misunderstood Jae Keun's heart.)

32
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,419
And Jae Keun just happened to...

33
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,390
- give Jin Ju his only vote. - Yes.

34
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,919
- She must be so confused. - Yes.

35
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,760
But I think I know who she voted for.

36
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:29,489
(The second evening at Palace Week)

37
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,130
It's the second evening at Palace Week in the single zone.

38
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:37,500
The result of the potential proposal votes will be revealed.

39
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,540
(Single men and women expressed their feelings.)

40
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:39,699
When your name is called,

41
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,169
please go to the lounge of the opposite sex...

42
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,880
and give them your profile card.

43
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,679
Female Number 19, Yoo Hye Won, please give him your profile card.

44
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,020
- Go ahead. - Let's go.

45
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:55,890
Don't give it to the wrong person.

46
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,490
Good luck.

47
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,759
(It's hard for her to leave as she cannot decide.)

48
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,500
- What's wrong? - What is it?

49
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,800
Has she not decided yet?

50
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,299
I can't wait to find out.

51
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,500
Me too.

52
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,770
She's not here yet.

53
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,640
Won't she go to Jae Keun?

54
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,510
No way.

55
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,780
What is it?

56
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,410
Did she not write anything?

57
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,780
She wrote a name, didn't she?

58
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,020
She told me that she wrote a name.

59
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,190
During that short period of time, I thought about it a lot.

60
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,919
(Before the final potential proposal vote)

61
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,360
You're very different from Jin Ju.

62
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,030
- I'm completely different from her. - You are.

63
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:43,400
Honestly, I find both of you attractive.

64
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:47,010
He told me that he also had someone else in mind...

65
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:51,080
and that it was hard for him to decide.

66
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,180
This is what Jae Keun told Hye Won.

67
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,049
He told her honestly that he was curious...

68
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,020
about both Jin Ju and Hye Won.

69
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:02,019
Hye Won, what kind of person do you like?

70
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,259
I like someone manly...

71
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,820
who can lead me.

72
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:10,089
(Men should be manly.)

73
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,560
I've never met a man...

74
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,599
who doesn't know which woman to choose.

75
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,700
It's my first time experiencing it.

76
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,510
That's why I'm so flustered.

77
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,310
I still thought that I was closest...

78
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,280
to Male Number Three.

79
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:34,920
(Hye Won enters the men's lounge carefully to deliver her vote)

80
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,619
- I can't wait to find out. - Me too.

81
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,920
- Do it now. - I want to know.

82
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,830
I...

83
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,169
(What is Hye Won's decision?)

84
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,170
You...

85
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,340
What's going on?

86
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:53,100
(What is Hye Won's decision?)

87
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,610
I abstain.

88
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,080
Goodbye.

89
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,089
(She abstained from choosing.)

90
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,150
- Goodness. - Oh, no.

91
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:17,159
(Why did she give up on choosing?)

92
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,059
I can't keep a poker face...

93
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,570
so I avoided his eyes.

94
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,539
I thought that Number Three would pick me,

95
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,940
but he didn't.

96
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:32,609
And it's not like I can steal him from her.

97
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,349
I can't seduce him and say,

98
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,049
"You're supposed to be with me."

99
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:40,120
I'm not the type of person who would do that.

100
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,350
I didn't want to destroy their relationship...

101
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,120
and force our relationship to happen.

102
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,790
When a man insists on being with me ten times,

103
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,130
I tend to let it happen.

104
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,099
In a way,

105
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,370
Hye Won and I had been matched.

106
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,540
It's true that I was more drawn to her.

107
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,310
However,

108
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,450
could I be responsible for her...

109
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,780
and continue our relationship?

110
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,750
Could I really marry her?

111
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:18,820
That's what I honestly thought.

112
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,689
I thought that I should concentrate...

113
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,760
on whom I choose.

114
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,230
That's why I only chose one person.

115
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,769
Seriously?

116
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,480
(Hye Won announces that she gave up on choosing.)

117
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,879
- You didn't pick anyone? - Yes.

118
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,850
(The atmosphere becomes heavy in the women's lounge.)

119
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,879
Oh, no.

120
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,220
- Right now... - I know.

121
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:51,620
- But... - She's crying.

122
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,159
- What's wrong? - You can do it.

123
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,490
She's crying because I'm leaving.

124
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,699
(Sin Da who grew fond of Hye Won starts crying out of sadness.)

125
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,960
Oh, no.

126
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,930
Is she crying? Is Sin Da really crying?

127
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,970
Don't cry.

128
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,810
I understand.

129
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,779
And Jae Keun was also focusing on...

130
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,779
who would be most appropriate as his spouse.

131
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,250
Hye Won wants someone who only wants her.

132
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,679
- Right. - She wants him...

133
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,879
- to choose only her. - That's right.

134
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,289
If Hye Won had been more forward with him,

135
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,220
Jae Keun might have changed his mind.

136
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,990
(It's unfortunate, but we hope that they won't regret the decision.)

137
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:32,530
The potential proposal vote has ended.

138
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,400
Those who must leave...

139
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,500
COUPLE PALACE for not receiving any vote will be announced.

140
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,870
Male Number Eight, Lee Yoon Seo.

141
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,309
It's okay because I don't feel bad about it.

142
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:47,109
- Male Number 28, Oh Sang Joon. - I had a good time.

143
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,049
- Thank you very much. - Sang Joon.

144
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,050
(Male Number 28, Oh Sang Joon is sent out.)

145
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,820
Goodbye, everyone.

146
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,890
Female Number 12, Jung Na Kyung.

147
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,819
- Think of it as a good thing. - I agree.

148
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,760
Lastly, those who gave up on proposing...

149
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,989
will be announced.

150
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,699
(And those who gave up on proposing...)

151
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,700
Female Number Eight, Choi Seo Hee.

152
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,830
What?

153
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,700
- Goodness. - She abstained.

154
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,469
Goodness.

155
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,610
Seo Hee gave up on choosing.

156
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,109
- I'll abstain from choosing. - Okay.

157
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,680
(I'll abstain from choosing.)

158
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,790
(Seo Hee forces herself to smile and says goodbye.)

159
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:33,389
We both abstained.

160
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:37,090
(The women say goodbye to each other.)

161
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,500
Female Number 19, Yoo Hye Won.

162
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,100
You may leave COUPLE PALACE.

163
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,900
Stop crying.

164
00:07:45,901 --> 00:07:47,770
- Why are you crying? - She's being ridiculous.

165
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,309
Stop crying.

166
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,339
Don't leave.

167
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,039
Why are you crying?

168
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,079
- I'm sorry. - What are you sorry about?

169
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,409
(Jin Ju who got Jae Keun's vote is crying because she feels sorry.)

170
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:56,780
Why would you feel sorry?

171
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,480
Jin Ju felt very sorry for me.

172
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,220
She didn't have to feel sorry.

173
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,760
- I'm sorry, Seo Hee. - It's okay.

174
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:08,530
Seriously.

175
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,259
It's not something she should feel sorry about.

176
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,400
Jin Ju, don't feel sorry about it.

177
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:19,540
Those who are eliminated may leave COUPLE PALACE now.

178
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,610
Jae Keun is probably the one who feels the most uncomfortable.

179
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:26,679
(Hye Won smiles brightly at Jae Keun for the last time.)

180
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,750
I'm part of the reason...

181
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:32,980
why Hye Won and Seo Hee are leaving.

182
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,890
I didn't feel good about it.

183
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,420
Goodbye, everyone.

184
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,990
- Take care. - Goodbye, everyone.

185
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,130
- Bye. - Get home safely.

186
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,559
Be careful of the snow.

187
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,060
- Over there. - The door is this way.

188
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,500
Bye.

189
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:47,500
(Those who are leaving depart with a bright smile.)

190
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,469
However they feel,

191
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:54,769
I hope that it won't leave them scarred.

192
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,010
That's what I thought.

193
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,480
- They grew on each other. - Oh, no.

194
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,010
Marriage isn't easy, is it?

195
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,810
It's not easy.

196
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:10,119
What do I have to do to get married?

197
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,290
That's what was on my mind.

198
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,520
This is what I feel every time.

199
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,390
Those who got married...

200
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:20,769
have met someone very precious.

201
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:24,100
I was reminded of that again.

202
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,209
(That's how Hye Won left COUPLE PALACE.)

203
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,180
Unfortunately, Hye Won left Palace Week.

204
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,710
I don't feel good about it.

205
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:42,620
(The atmosphere gets depressed in the single zone.)

206
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:50,230
(Jae Keun feels heavy.)

207
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,769
(After the final potential proposal vote)

208
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:57,770
What do you think?

209
00:09:57,771 --> 00:09:59,400
I really don't know what to do.

210
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,240
Jae Yeon is very sincere about Joo Hee.

211
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,340
I know.

212
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,640
But I think Joo Hee is sincere about me.

213
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,749
It's so embarrassing.

214
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,619
(Joo Hee requested to talk with Sang Gyeong.)

215
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,620
Yes.

216
00:10:12,621 --> 00:10:16,119
Joo Hee expressed her feelings...

217
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,320
- to Sang Gyeong. - That's right.

218
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,790
Shall we talk again tomorrow?

219
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,859
Don't you think that the women will choose...

220
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,560
during breakfast tomorrow?

221
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,860
Then eat with me.

222
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,430
Unless I'm sure,

223
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,570
- I can't decide. - Let's eat together.

224
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,710
- I'm still not sure. - You're not sure?

225
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,679
I think she's still deciding...

226
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,050
between Sang Gyeong and Jae Yeon.

227
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,380
I think so. She's still deciding.

228
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,220
- I don't want to suffer anymore. - Right.

229
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,290
I want to eat happily.

230
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,120
Tomorrow?

231
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,960
See you tomorrow.

232
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,230
I thought that things would go well...

233
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,930
between Joo Hee and Jae Yeon.

234
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,170
That's why I picked Jin Ju.

235
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,840
But Joo Hee is also a good person.

236
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:11,710
In some ways, she's better than Jin Ju.

237
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,779
As you know,

238
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,950
you shouldn't hold yourself back...

239
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,080
just because of Jae Yeon.

240
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,180
- Right. - Right?

241
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,019
There was some bromance between Jae Yeon and Sang Gyeong.

242
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,089
Right, they rooted for each other.

243
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:28,090
There's a love triangle among them.

244
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,999
Not staying true to your feelings for someone else's sake...

245
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,230
- Right. - That's not right.

246
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,870
- It could hurt everyone. - That's right.

247
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,699
(The second night of the Palace Week deepens.)

248
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,399
I think he might have a strong personality.

249
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,640
- Who? - Male Number 24.

250
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,310
I like sweet guys...

251
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,739
who are accommodating.

252
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,550
- Then go with Male Number 7. - Then it's Male Number 7.

253
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:52,050
(Joo Hee's struggling with her conflicting feelings.)

254
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,420
Isn't he good-looking?

255
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,590
- Who? - Male Number 24.

256
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,059
Hold on. Why won't you say anything?

257
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,889
- You have bad eyesight, right? - My gosh.

258
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,529
- Look at him with glasses on. - Seriously. Hear me out.

259
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:05,230
Male Number 24 is so popular. Why do you think he's so popular?

260
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,230
- Gosh, the look on your face! - What?

261
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,470
I'm sorry.

262
00:12:08,471 --> 00:12:10,800
She just can't stop feeling attracted to him.

263
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,899
Oh, no. What do I do with this sweet, kind guy?

264
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,410
How did you leave things with Male Number 24?

265
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:20,010
He thought that I joined the show for fun.

266
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,379
Yes. You are having fun right now...

267
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,380
- between Male Number 7 and 24. - My gosh.

268
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,050
"Oh, no. Male Number Seven is so sweet and kind."

269
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,489
"Male Number 24 is so handsome."

270
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,360
When did I say it like that?

271
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,230
- Remember this morning? - My gosh.

272
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,290
You need to pick someone,

273
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,699
so you can check out...

274
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,959
- the reality of the match. - Right.

275
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,970
- I need to pick someone fast. - Yes.

276
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,370
Go with Male Number Seven.

277
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,840
- Seven? - Yes.

278
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:49,310
It looks like Si Yeon is subtly trying to push for Jae Yeon.

279
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,279
Be with someone who will be kind to you.

280
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,649
- Right? - Yes.

281
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:55,949
(She feels even more lost as the night goes on.)

282
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,149
I can relate.

283
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,849
All three guys have different appealing qualities.

284
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,849
- Right. - Jae Yeon makes her feel safe.

285
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,949
Sang Gyeong has a similar sense of humor.

286
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,920
- Young Taek is handsome and hip. - Yes.

287
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,589
- They're all attractive. - Right.

288
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,329
- So she has a lot on her mind. - Imagine if we could combine them.

289
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,659
- Right. - You can't combine them...

290
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,829
or split them.

291
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,030
She must make up her mind now.

292
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,440
(Late night on Day 2)

293
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,340
(No one is out in the hall.)

294
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,839
(The night is quiet as everyone is asleep.)

295
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,509
(Sin Da is the only one who's awake.)

296
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,750
I was torn.

297
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:30,180
Jung Won really was my only choice.

298
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:34,020
But I need a sense of assurance to go all in with one guy.

299
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:37,620
(Sin Da leaves after thinking long and hard about it.)

300
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,860
(Where is she headed?)

301
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,330
(She's heading to the secret mailbox.)

302
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,229
Sin Da applied for a secret date...

303
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,069
as soon as she arrived in the couple zone.

304
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,070
Right.

305
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,500
There was a major development as soon as she arrived.

306
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:56,439
I'm quite worried about Sin Da and Jung Won.

307
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,240
(Who is her secret date?)

308
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,009
Jung Won has no idea, right?

309
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,350
This isn't right. She's in the couple zone now.

310
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,360
(She's waiting for her secret date.)

311
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:15,130
I wanted to test my true feelings.

312
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:21,230
(At that moment, a man heads to Sin Da.)

313
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,369
(Who could he be?)

314
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,139
You can sort of guess who he might be, right?

315
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,810
We can guess.

316
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,510
Oh, no. Poor Jung Won. Close your eyes.

317
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,210
My gosh.

318
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,080
Why are you doing this to me?

319
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,020
What are you doing?

320
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,090
My gosh, it's Ji Woong.

321
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,950
Ha Yeon, you too. Don't watch this.

322
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,090
- I know you like it. - Sin Da.

323
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,190
- Well, of course. - You seem very happy.

324
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:53,000
Gosh, Sin Da. You invited me to a secret date.

325
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,429
One of my conditions was...

326
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,230
a two-million-dollar home when we were married.

327
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:01,040
I think Ji Woong is the only one who can meet...

328
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,470
my condition for marriage.

329
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,010
You look very beautiful today.

330
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,350
You dressed up like an ideal daughter-in-law.

331
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,710
Right.

332
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,590
You seem different from usual.

333
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,890
I had no idea that it would be you.

334
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,229
- Really? - Yes.

335
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,560
- Why not? - You came up as a couple.

336
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,199
If I didn't ask you out on a secret date,

337
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,970
were you going to ask me out?

338
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,910
If you were in the single zone, then I would have.

339
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,070
- Really? - Yes.

340
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,080
But you're not with him 100 percent?

341
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,649
To be honest, if I only consider my condition for marriage,

342
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:48,220
you're the closest to meeting it.

343
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,520
I might be more compatible in terms of marriage?

344
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,990
In terms of conditions for marriage?

345
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,960
- Are you in debt? - No.

346
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,129
I have about a million dollars in cash.

347
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,570
You saved up a lot.

348
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,340
Yes, I did. I rarely spend money.

349
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,640
I only invest in cars.

350
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:10,939
That's manly.

351
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,580
- I just need a nice car and a home. - Yes.

352
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,480
But for your girlfriend, you would...

353
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,519
"Would you spend money on your girlfriend?"

354
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,950
- Seriously. - Is that what she's asking?

355
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,790
Let's say she wants to buy something.

356
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,230
Buying things for them...

357
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,830
isn't a problem for me.

358
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,700
(Impressed)

359
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,530
And I feel that's why you're attracted to me.

360
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:38,770
- Yes. - Right?

361
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,899
- Well, this... - They're being so blunt.

362
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,909
Yes, they are.

363
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,010
(Their secret and blunt date is quite stimulating to watch.)

364
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,210
I don't think that's a bad thing.

365
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:48,549
I believe that I'm still here because I can appeal to women...

366
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,680
with my financial assets.

367
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,350
So that's that.

368
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,090
I like you, Sin Da.

369
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,490
I would only get a chance...

370
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:01,629
to meet someone like you on a TV show like this.

371
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,460
I never thought I would meet...

372
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,399
someone so out of my league in real life.

373
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,929
But look at me, on a date with you.

374
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:10,930
So that actually makes me feel more attracted to you.

375
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,100
I wonder if this is fate.

376
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:15,970
- This is getting serious. - What? He likes her?

377
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,009
He said he was never this forward...

378
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,579
when it came to romantic relationships.

379
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,779
But when he was with me,

380
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,379
he found himself leading the conversation.

381
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,980
He said he never felt this way before.

382
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,850
My heart fluttered when he said that.

383
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:33,060
Sin Da is already falling for Ji Woong.

384
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,289
Right. They're both not offended by this conversation.

385
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,459
- It's going so smoothly. - Yes.

386
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,229
- "Can you do this for me?" - Right.

387
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,399
They're compatible.

388
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,960
- This is going to change things. - Right.

389
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,400
I noticed last time that you could change your mind.

390
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:51,610
Right. I didn't go all in for her.

391
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,009
Ha Yeon said from the beginning that...

392
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,479
we were a good match.

393
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,180
So I didn't feel the need to express my interest.

394
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,219
But there's something about you. It's the kind of feeling you get...

395
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,719
- when you eat junk food. - My gosh.

396
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,790
This thing about you drives me... How should I put it?

397
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,599
- Does that excite you? - Yes, it does.

398
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,769
So I think dating someone like you could be different.

399
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,329
Perhaps, I might be able...

400
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,869
to find an ideal type I wasn't aware of.

401
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:20,870
Are you saying that...

402
00:18:20,871 --> 00:18:23,240
- you're more attracted to me? - Well,

403
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:27,379
I definitely feel more intense feelings for you.

404
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,380
(I definitely feel more intense feelings for you.)

405
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,579
It feels like things could go somewhere...

406
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,550
between you and me.

407
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,320
But Jung Won...

408
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,959
If I stayed in the single zone yesterday...

409
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,990
instead of becoming a couple...

410
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,429
If you weren't in the couple zone,

411
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,790
you would have been my first choice.

412
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,700
- I would be your first choice? - Because...

413
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,900
Well, isn't that obvious?

414
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,070
Ji Woong, do you want to be tempted?

415
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,970
I want to be tempted and tempt you too.

416
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:00,510
I'm special to Ji Woong.

417
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,550
It made me wonder if I would have...

418
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,550
matched with Ji Woong if I hadn't matched with Jung Won.

419
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,820
That crossed my mind.

420
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,920
- Having intense feelings... - Yes.

421
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,689
- could be dangerous. - That's right.

422
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:14,960
- I have no idea what will happen. - Right.

423
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,659
(The breakfast date in the couple zone)

424
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,200
- We're the first ones here. - My gosh.

425
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,999
(Ha Yeon comes in after Sin Da.)

426
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,670
Ha Yeon is right there.

427
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,139
What if the couple zone suddenly turns into the single zone...

428
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:32,280
- just because we came? - Right?

429
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,310
The gaze.

430
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,720
(The two of them are conscious of one another.)

431
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,089
If they were happy together,

432
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,990
I wouldn't have interfered.

433
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,590
Good morning.

434
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,900
- Morning. - Good morning.

435
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,030
With Ha Yeon, it's like a slowly flowing river.

436
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,670
With Sin Da, it's like a storm.

437
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,109
(There's Ji Woong whom she had a secret date with.)

438
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,140
- This is the couple zone, right? - This is crazy.

439
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:08,510
(There's Jung Won who came to the couple zone with her.)

440
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,609
(Last night at the party in the couple zone)

441
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:11,950
How did your interview go?

442
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:15,820
He kept asking me about Sin Da.

443
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,220
She's my roommate.

444
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:18,460
- Is that so? - Yes.

445
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,330
- The hints directed at Ji Woong. - I see.

446
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,660
I guess there's something between them. I'm not sure.

447
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,499
Ji Woong was mentioned again and again.

448
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,600
So I had my suspicions.

449
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,669
Jung Won found out yesterday about possible feelings...

450
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,540
- between Ji Woong and Sin Da. - Yes.

451
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,640
I bet all kinds of thoughts are crossing his mind now.

452
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,010
Good morning.

453
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,620
(She greets Jung Won.)

454
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,850
(Then her gaze...)

455
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,620
(lands on none other than Ji Woong.)

456
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,030
(The two of them make eye contact.)

457
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,699
The two of them can't help looking at each other.

458
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,870
(They are subtly conscious of one another.)

459
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,600
I wonder what will happen today.

460
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,469
He pretended to be so classy.

461
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,580
Then I saw him finish all the pretzels here.

462
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,780
- So... - There she goes again.

463
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,109
- His true colors showed. - No.

464
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,110
- I guess he liked them. - You finished everything.

465
00:21:16,111 --> 00:21:18,649
You're teasing me for finishing the crumbs.

466
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,320
- Seriously. - You're teasing me.

467
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,420
Fine. I'll buy you a bag once we're done with the show.

468
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,859
Interacting with her is quite stimulating.

469
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,490
So she definitely draws me in.

470
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,559
- The pretzels... - Their partners are right there.

471
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,960
- But they keep glancing. - He took the cheese.

472
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,530
To be honest, I didn't feel good.

473
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,800
I wasn't sure what to do.

474
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,270
(There's an odd vibe in the couple zone.)

475
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,909
You said my eyelashes looked like flytraps.

476
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,880
So I put on only ten false eyelashes today.

477
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:50,309
- He's not smiling. - Gosh, look at his face.

478
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,580
(Jung Won is indifferent to Sin Da's comment.)

479
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,050
Are we taking wedding pictures today?

480
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,590
Then I have to change my shoes.

481
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,559
He seems really cold when he's not smiling.

482
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,630
(Jung Won just nods without saying anything.)

483
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,760
I thought, "What's going on?"

484
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:09,700
He didn't seem that interested.

485
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,600
Why aren't you eating?

486
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,040
I'm not hungry.

487
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,470
I rarely have breakfast.

488
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:19,840
He was sweet and kind to me when we were in the single zone.

489
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,250
But how should I put it?

490
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,379
Today, it was awkward.

491
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,180
He sort of felt like a different person.

492
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:31,320
(Jung Won quietly gets up first.)

493
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,229
- I guess he was very upset. - Of course.

494
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,259
(She finishes her breakfast with Jung Won who seems different.)

495
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,860
My gosh. Sin Da can act as if nothing happened...

496
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,829
because she thinks...

497
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,699
Jung Won doesn't know about the fling...

498
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,539
- between Ji Woong and her. - Right.

499
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,369
To Sin Da, the change in Jung Won's attitude...

500
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:49,440
- must feel quite sudden. - That's right.

501
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,209
(After the breakfast, they come to the couple's room.)

502
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:54,210
They're in the couple's room. Oh, no.

503
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,750
I wonder what they'll talk about.

504
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:01,920
(Jung Won is especially quiet today.)

505
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,120
I thought, "What's going on?" He was different.

506
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,519
He has this cute smile with his lips twitching.

507
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,529
He didn't show me his smile today.

508
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:10,590
(He's not smiling today.)

509
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,830
You look very handsome today.

510
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,970
I think you're the best-looking guy...

511
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:18,499
among the remaining guys.

512
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:22,270
Well, there were many better-looking guys than me.

513
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,379
But a handsome face isn't everything.

514
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,110
I need to look at the whole package.

515
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,850
When it comes to considering the whole package,

516
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,480
you're the best one here.

517
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,290
Sin Da. I think...

518
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:40,490
you're very popular too.

519
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,490
- My gosh. - She can't get to him.

520
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,860
No matter how much she compliments him...

521
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:45,859
Why are you talking to me like that?

522
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:49,130
I'm not saying that you're a popular guy.

523
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,000
(Sighing)

524
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,670
(The awkward silence continues.)

525
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,179
Let's say we didn't become a couple.

526
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,379
If you could match with anyone,

527
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,820
whom would you have chosen?

528
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,480
Be honest.

529
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:13,360
(Jung Won hesitates to answer for a long time.)

530
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,590
Be really honest.

531
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,430
Then I'll be honest too.

532
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,200
Well...

533
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:31,879
Female Number 21.

534
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,310
(Female Number 21, Oh Seung Yeon)

535
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,880
- Seung Yeon. - My gosh.

536
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,480
I naturally assumed that he would say my name.

537
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,220
I'm certain now.

538
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,590
I don't want to be locked up in the room alone.

539
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,990
I won't let that happen.

540
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,289
(Up until last night, he made her feel assured.)

541
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,430
Things were great between them up until that moment.

542
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,930
(But this morning, he's naming another woman.)

543
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,270
Why her?

544
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,470
Is she your ideal type in terms of appearance?

545
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,840
Yes.

546
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:06,479
I couldn't understand what was going on.

547
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,010
(Sin Da can't understand this situation.)

548
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:13,280
(In the end, she leaves the room.)

549
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,489
It must have hurt her feelings...

550
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,390
- and her pride as well. - Right.

551
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,659
But she doesn't know Jung Won knows about Ji Woong.

552
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,989
(She closes her eyes to clear out her cluttered mind.)

553
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:24,230
(Then she remembers something.)

554
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,660
Is there someone you'd like to talk to?

555
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:30,530
(Female Number 21 Oh Seung Yeon)

556
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,169
(The sight of Jung Won and Seung Yeon together...)

557
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:35,140
(from yesterday flashes before her eyes.)

558
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,470
I felt a sense of betrayal.

559
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:41,479
I was true to my feelings and showed my genuine side...

560
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,379
when I talked to him, so we spent time together.

561
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,679
I was transparent with him and told him everything.

562
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,949
But after all this time, he told me I wasn't his first choice...

563
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,519
and someone else was his first choice.

564
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,090
The fact that he said that...

565
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:58,630
was really disappointing. How could he do that?

566
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,400
(Jung Won follows her out.)

567
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,939
If you saw her first on the speed train,

568
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,480
would you have chosen her?

569
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,980
You said if you could pick anyone, you would have picked her.

570
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,089
- It feels like... - Well...

571
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,389
you're here because...

572
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,760
- you couldn't match with her. - Listen.

573
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,829
Here's the thing.

574
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:33,259
Even if I could pick anyone and become a couple,

575
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:36,570
I would still have chosen you.

576
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:42,310
Well, say something.

577
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,150
Don't you think things are going wrong now?

578
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:56,620
What would have happened if I didn't ask you earlier?

579
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:00,290
I was going to talk about this today.

580
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,659
Whatever I say...

581
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:06,430
No. I just want you to tell me as it is.

582
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,170
Yesterday, she...

583
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:12,699
gave me her vote.

584
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:16,170
(Unexpectedly, Seung Yeon gave him a vote.)

585
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:19,680
Do you now think that there's a possibility with her?

586
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,880
Back then, that didn't cross my mind.

587
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,050
Okay.

588
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,979
When we got to the couple zone yesterday,

589
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,780
some things happened.

590
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,490
Like what?

591
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:35,130
(He kept asking me about Sin Da.)

592
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,989
(He found out the connection between Ji Woong and Sin Da...)

593
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,760
(for the first time after coming to the couple zone.)

594
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,100
Like what?

595
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,869
I can't tell you everything.

596
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:48,639
Did you go on a date yesterday?

597
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,440
(Did you go on a date yesterday?)

598
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,440
Yes.

599
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,779
(Jung Won also went on a secret date like Sin Da.)

600
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,449
- He went on a date. - Really?

601
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,450
He went on a date?

602
00:27:58,451 --> 00:27:59,720
- He went on a secret date? - Really?

603
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,680
- He also went on a secret date? - Really?

604
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,690
I'm feeling tempted once again.

605
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:14,830
(Jung Won expressed his interest for the first time to Seung Yeon.)

606
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:18,200
(The two of them forgot about the cold weather and had fun.)

607
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,709
I threw the snow because I wanted to talk to you.

608
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:25,110
- Really? - Yeah.

609
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,280
It was just a regular conversation.

610
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,780
But it was really fun.

611
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,850
(And...)

612
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:38,390
(Seung Yeon responded to his interest in her.)

613
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:42,329
(At that moment, he couldn't hide his feelings.)

614
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,560
Why are you smiling like that?

615
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:45,660
I'm being honest right now.

616
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,299
(He also had lingering feelings about Seung Yeon.)

617
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,599
Jung Won found out about her interest in him...

618
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,770
- when he got the vote from her. - I see.

619
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,610
I think it might be my last chance.

620
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,009
(He requested a secret date.)

621
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,580
- Gosh, he requested it. No way. - He did it.

622
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,719
(Sin Da is getting ready for the secret date.)

623
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,819
Both of them?

624
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,490
(Jung Won is getting ready for the secret date.)

625
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,660
(Jung Won leaves the room after getting ready.)

626
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,800
(So does Sin Da.)

627
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:21,360
(They're walking different paths.)

628
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,430
Oh, my. They...

629
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,029
Both of them weren't focused on each other.

630
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,900
They were interested in someone else.

631
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:30,770
(They open the door to meet someone else.)

632
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:35,810
(And they also waited for someone else.)

633
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:39,050
(Jung Won and Sin Da are on misaligned paths.)

634
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,479
(I had lingering feelings.)

635
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,090
(I wanted to test my true feelings.)

636
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:47,990
(The two of them were tempted to explore other options.)

637
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:50,090
(Sin Da's secret date, Male Number 11, Kim Ji Woong)

638
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:52,600
(Jung Won's secret date, Female Number 21, Oh Seung Yeon)

639
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,100
Hello.

640
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:56,270
(A secret date between Jung Won and Seung Yeon)

641
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,930
- Hello. - My gosh.

642
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,839
When Sin Da was on her secret date,

643
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,540
Jung Won was also on his secret date.

644
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,710
That's right.

645
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,680
You had to wake up very early, right?

646
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,520
The same goes for you.

647
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,120
Well,

648
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,950
did you know whom you were meeting?

649
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,090
I requested this date.

650
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,900
(Seung Yeon also requested the secret date?)

651
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,960
- Hold on. - Oh, my!

652
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,429
- So it was mutual? - This is like watching a drama!

653
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,430
Oh, my.

654
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,340
(I requested this secret date.)

655
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,809
I... Wait. You did?

656
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:37,810
Yes.

657
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,010
I also did.

658
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,350
Really?

659
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,550
Yes.

660
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:45,950
I thought you came because I requested it.

661
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,280
- I see. Really? - That's what I thought.

662
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,150
(The two of them requested a secret date with each other.)

663
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,550
- I thought I wouldn't have... - Yes.

664
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,660
Another chance if I didn't request it yesterday.

665
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,960
I still had lingering feelings.

666
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:59,030
So...

667
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,229
I requested this secret date with you.

668
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,230
(She also requested a date with him.)

669
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:06,640
That's fascinating.

670
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,910
Right.

671
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,910
Did you request it?

672
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:20,380
Yes, I did.

673
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:26,260
Then why did you become a couple with me?

674
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,230
You should have been more careful with your decision.

675
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:32,400
I guess I was too careful.

676
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,800
But things are a little complicated now.

677
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:41,070
I can't help but consider a lot of things.

678
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,510
I understand.

679
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:50,410
You're not coming back to the single zone, are you?

680
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,610
Are you?

681
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,820
Let me ask you again.

682
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:01,090
Say Number 21 asked you out...

683
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:04,830
on a secret date, wanting to be a couple with you.

684
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,560
And she says, "I thought about it,"

685
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,100
"and I think I can be a couple with you."

686
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,570
What would you do, then?

687
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,410
It'd be nice if you came back.

688
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,990
Stay here. I'll come back.

689
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,830
- Do you mean it? - Yes.

690
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:49,340
I think I'll become a couple with her.

691
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:54,440
(I think I'll become a couple with her.)

692
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,780
Then, why...

693
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:00,880
didn't you tell me that sooner?

694
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:07,119
So, I wasn't the one you wanted to be coupled up with...

695
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,060
in the first place.

696
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,470
I'm not going to chase after you.

697
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:20,400
I can't date a guy who considers me as his second option.

698
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,010
Like I'm better than that.

699
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,240
I feel cheated.

700
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:31,050
You've been my favorite the whole time.

701
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,490
Should we go back to the single zone then?

702
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,700
Are you sure you won't regret this decision?

703
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,340
I wouldn't have brought it up if I was going to.

704
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:59,110
(They're about to end their relationship.)

705
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,790
We're going to the single zone.

706
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:20,030
(Lee Jung Won, Oh Sin Da)

707
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,800
(Jung Won and Sin Da leave the couple zone.)

708
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,799
I want to turn back time.

709
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,539
(I want to turn back time.)

710
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,540
Perfect match.

711
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,410
I regret it so much.

712
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:55,530
(From the couple zone to the single zone...)

713
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:00,900
I feel so bad for her.

714
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:07,040
"You should have told me sooner."

715
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:10,350
When she said that,

716
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,380
I felt terrible.

717
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,259
(Jung Won and Sin Da decided to part ways.)

718
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,990
But they were such a cute couple!

719
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:30,300
Jerk.

720
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,770
- Where is she going? - What?

721
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:35,840
(Sin Da knocks on someone's door.)

722
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,139
(Has she gone to Jung Won?)

723
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,670
- Is it his room? - Jung Won's room?

724
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,240
I have something to say.

725
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,150
To us?

726
00:35:45,151 --> 00:35:46,620
(Sin Da went to Ji Woong and Ha Yeon's couple's room.)

727
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:48,849
- What's happening? - Why?

728
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:49,850
- Why? - Wait a minute!

729
00:35:49,851 --> 00:35:51,650
Why would you go to another couple's room?

730
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:54,290
I have something to say.

731
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,430
To us?

732
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,699
I plan on going back to the single zone...

733
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:06,170
and doing everything I want with people I'm interested in...

734
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:07,840
without feeling any guilt.

735
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:11,140
I'm going to the single zone.

736
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,340
What?

737
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,240
Why?

738
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:18,310
Jung Won and I decided to stop being a couple.

739
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,050
I see.

740
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,620
But you were here for such a short time.

741
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:26,089
Did you both agree on it?

742
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:28,090
Yes, we talked and came to an agreement.

743
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,430
Goodbye.

744
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:36,170
He has someone else on his mind,

745
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:40,140
and I'm also interested in someone else.

746
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,410
So, we decided to say goodbye.

747
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,080
Is she telling him to come with her?

748
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,610
She's letting him know that she's going!

749
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,109
Jung Won is completely out...

750
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:54,050
of my interest now.

751
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:56,790
Anyways...

752
00:36:56,791 --> 00:36:58,490
(She leaves with a strong impression.)

753
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:01,290
(But Ji Woong's reaction is ambiguous.)

754
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,789
If I had been in the single zone,

755
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:06,530
he would have come to the single zone for me.

756
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,129
If you were in the single zone,

757
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:09,130
then I would have chosen you.

758
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:11,270
(Sin Da realized his feelings on the secret date.)

759
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,170
I believe he'll leave the couple zone for me.

760
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:16,470
Bye.

761
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:19,509
(He watches Sin Da as she leaves.)

762
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:21,479
But she could have done that when Ha Yeon wasn't around.

763
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,849
- I know. Why did she... - Ha Yeon is...

764
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:25,080
(And Ha Yeon watched all of it happen.)

765
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:28,920
I have a strong feeling that he'll go...

766
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,689
- with Sin Da. - Totally.

767
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,189
I'm so worried about Ha Yeon.

768
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,190
- So am I. - I know.

769
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:38,260
(What's going on in the single zone?)

770
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:43,069
From now on, the 1-on-1 breakfast dates...

771
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,429
- Oh, we need to get food. - will begin.

772
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,969
- Goodness. - I like today's breakfast.

773
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:47,170
It looks pretty good.

774
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:48,640
They all look delicious.

775
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,109
I'm going to fill myself up today. I need to stay energized.

776
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,139
We must.

777
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,880
You could say that this is our last day in the single zone.

778
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:59,219
For today's breakfast date, the men will be seated,

779
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,880
and the women will choose who to eat with.

780
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,220
My goal today is to make things clear with Jin Ju.

781
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,630
I plan on showing her that I won't be swayed.

782
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,830
This is our last moment,

783
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:14,860
and I'm going to impress Joo Hee.

784
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:17,399
The final decision is just around the corner,

785
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,370
so they'll be very cautious about choosing their dates.

786
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,609
- Hurry! - Oh, my gosh.

787
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:24,270
(The ladies are making a scene.)

788
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:25,540
(What's going on?)

789
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,310
They're running.

790
00:38:28,311 --> 00:38:30,179
- We're running. - Run!

791
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,409
(A race begins out of nowhere.)

792
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:32,480
What's going on?

793
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,249
(Soo Jin arrived first.)

794
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,319
Soo Jin is first.

795
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,489
They don't have much time left,

796
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:40,860
- Yes. - so they're desperate.

797
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,330
I thought there was a race.

798
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:49,269
I had a feeling that the men would be seated...

799
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:51,370
in the morning just like last time.

800
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:53,039
Soo Jin must have predicted it as well.

801
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,170
She started running out of nowhere.

802
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:59,840
So I also ran.

803
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,549
Soo Jin was first,

804
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,850
and I was second.

805
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:08,780
So, I was worried I might not be able to eat with Number 21.

806
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:13,420
(Kyung Seok gave a potential proposal vote...)

807
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,620
(to Soo Jin as well.)

808
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,489
Right.

809
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:19,029
- He's interested in Soo Jin too, - Oh, right.

810
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,299
- so she's bothered... - You're right.

811
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,230
By everything that Soo Jin does.

812
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:26,940
(Soo Jin got all of her food at that moment.)

813
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:31,170
(She goes straight without hesitation.)

814
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,579
(She chooses...)

815
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,580
(Kyung Seok.)

816
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:35,440
- It happened. - Oh, no.

817
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:40,379
(Stopping)

818
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:43,289
Poor Ye Rin. She should have gotten there faster.

819
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:44,390
Exactly.

820
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:48,989
I wonder whom she'll go to now.

821
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:52,060
(She thinks for a second and starts walking.)

822
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,700
- Good morning. - What?

823
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,700
(Ye Rin sits with Jae Keun.)

824
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:59,200
- That's not good. - What?

825
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,809
Oh, no. She chose Jae Keun...

826
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:05,510
who was sitting across from Kyung Seok.

827
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,179
This is going to get complicated.

828
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:09,150
(Things get complicated in the breakfast date session.)

829
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:11,979
(One person at the end of the line)

830
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,420
What do I do?

831
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:16,950
You need to let fate guide you.

832
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,550
I'm going to be fiery today.

833
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:20,520
I'll just follow my heart.

834
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,129
(She checks who's left.)

835
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,360
There are people who are competing for the same person.

836
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:30,770
I realized that Joo Hee was after Sang Gyeong.

837
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,270
Last night, out of nowhere,

838
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:36,270
she told me, "I'm going for Number 24."

839
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,469
I think I'll go for Number 24.

840
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,910
(Last night on their way back to the Palace)

841
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:43,250
I was so anxious,

842
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:45,110
and it bothered me so much.

843
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:46,920
I knew I was in trouble.

844
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:51,820
(Who will Joo Hee choose?)

845
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:55,789
Joo Hee has Jae Yeon, Sang Gyeong,

846
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:57,989
and Young Taek.

847
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:59,229
That's amazing.

848
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,230
(Kwon Young Taek, the CEO of an indie agency)

849
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,500
I was worried a lot.

850
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,699
(Last night at the party in the single zone)

851
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:06,700
Can we talk?

852
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,570
(Joo Hee asked Sang Gyeong for a private chat.)

853
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,209
(And Jae Yeon saw them.)

854
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:16,680
I think they're having a chat.

855
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,450
I'm just waiting.

856
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:21,850
I was worried.

857
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:26,060
She wanted to have a chat the next morning,

858
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:27,790
so I told her that we should eat together.

859
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,630
I asked her to talk over breakfast.

860
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:31,189
- Don't you think - Yes?

861
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:33,400
That the women will choose during breakfast tomorrow?

862
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:34,830
Then eat with me.

863
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:36,370
See you tomorrow.

864
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,539
She even said, "See you tomorrow."

865
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,540
(Sang Gyeong is waiting for Joo Hee.)

866
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:47,539
I had made up my mind...

867
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:50,710
and decided to go for one person, starting today.

868
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,520
- Really? - Just one person?

869
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:55,420
Joo Hee must have made up her mind now.

870
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,919
Who will she go for?

871
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,790
(Focused on who Joo Hee will choose.)

872
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,260
I think she'll pick Sang Gyeong.

873
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,999
They had such a good chat the night before.

874
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,259
They resolved all the misunderstandings.

875
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:11,800
(Where is Joo Hee headed?)

876
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,600
Hello.

877
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:16,370
You put your hair down today.

878
00:42:16,371 --> 00:42:17,509
(Joo Hee chose Jae Yeon.)

879
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:18,940
- It was Jae Yeon! - Jae Yeon?

880
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,580
What is this?

881
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,880
This is way beyond my expectations.

882
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:27,450
But...

883
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:29,849
she didn't come to me.

884
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:31,850
(But she didn't come.)

885
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:35,090
She was so sincere when we talked last night,

886
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,829
but she didn't pick me in the morning,

887
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:39,260
so I couldn't help but think that she didn't mean it.

888
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,870
"What am I supposed to do now?"

889
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:45,800
You put your hair down today.

890
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:49,940
- Don't I look happy today? - Sorry?

891
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:51,309
Don't I look happy?

892
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:52,940
- You do. - Right?

893
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,380
But why?

894
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:57,110
(Curious)

895
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:59,380
I've been lost for a while,

896
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,819
and I've made up my mind to go for you.

897
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:06,459
(I've made up my mind to go for you.)

898
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,590
- Do you mean that? - Yes.

899
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,989
Good for you, Jae Yeon!

900
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:13,230
(He finally puts on a bright smile.)

901
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,859
Oh, my gosh. He's so happy.

902
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,070
(I'm happy.)

903
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:19,200
I didn't know he could smile so brightly.

904
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,400
She said she had made up her mind.

905
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,369
I thought, "So, she picked me."

906
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:25,840
(She picked me.)

907
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:28,180
I could tell that he was happy.

908
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:32,349
I imagined my marriage with him,

909
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:34,750
and it seemed joyful and fun.

910
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,850
But with Sang Gyeong,

911
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,720
I couldn't imagine what we'd be like if we were married.

912
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,490
But I'm here to get married,

913
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,499
so I chose Number Seven with a light heart.

914
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,530
I decided to go for him only.

915
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:52,030
It's really hard to get an answer from you.

916
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,210
I needed to be careful. It's about marriage, after all.

917
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:00,740
- It must have been hard. - What?

918
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,980
It must have been hard for you.

919
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,080
Looks like you lost weight.

920
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:07,580
Really?

921
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:10,420
I'm sorry.

922
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:14,290
Thank you for being direct with me.

923
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:18,330
It's like a weight has been lifted now that I've decided.

924
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,130
It was a huge load off my mind...

925
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:24,470
when I set my mind on one person.

926
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,239
I'm only going for Number Seven and no one else.

927
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,269
(She picked the straightforward Jae Yeon...)

928
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:30,270
(after a long deliberation.)

929
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,079
Props to Jae Yeon...

930
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,410
- for waiting without swaying. - Right.

931
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:37,049
- I bet Joo Hee could sense it. - Indeed.

932
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:38,179
I'm telling you.

933
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,850
So, it does work out well when you wait.

934
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,520
(Jin Ju saw who Joo Hee chose.)

935
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,420
It was a relief. That's good.

936
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,960
I was like, "That's my seat and my husband."

937
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:51,689
It really is fortunate for Jin Ju.

938
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:53,159
- She got rid of a competitor. - Right.

939
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,560
- I bet she's thinking that. - She was her toughest competition.

940
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,370
I looked over to see who Jae Keun was eating with,

941
00:44:57,870 --> 00:44:59,330
and Ye Rin was sitting before him.

942
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:03,540
But I didn't even get jealous. I felt nothing.

943
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:06,379
(She proudly walks past Jae Keun.)

944
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:08,909
She goes to Sang Gyeong without any difficulties.

945
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:09,910
Exactly.

946
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,979
- Hi. - Good morning.

947
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:14,420
- Did you have a good sleep? - Yes.

948
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:20,660
You should drink it with water. It's lemon water.

949
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,129
(She gives him a gift as soon as she sits down.)

950
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:25,530
Thanks. Do I take it after eating?

951
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:28,359
No, you mix the powder with water,

952
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,030
and it turns into lemon water.

953
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:34,699
I didn't even sleep for a minute.

954
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:37,309
I stayed up all night and came here.

955
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:39,140
Why didn't you sleep? You must be so tired.

956
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:42,340
I had a lot on my mind.

957
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:45,849
(Her mind was filled with Jae Keun and Sang Gyeong.)

958
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:47,250
- Eat up. - You too.

959
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:50,189
I had so much to think about who to choose...

960
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:52,390
as my future husband,

961
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:54,190
so I ended up staying all night.

962
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:57,989
She was also torn...

963
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:01,100
between Jae Keun and Sang Gyeong all night.

964
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:05,070
- Oh, no. - I didn't even sleep a wink.

965
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:07,539
- So, let's take some vitamins. - Sure.

966
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:08,570
- Cheers. - Cheers.

967
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:12,409
Jin Ju brought vitamin C,

968
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:13,640
so I drank the lemon water.

969
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:16,450
I'm not sure if she brought that to drink with me.

970
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:18,850
See?

971
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:21,820
He's lost some trust in her.

972
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:24,390
I can't figure her out now.

973
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,189
I heard yesterday...

974
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:29,190
Yes?

975
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:31,360
When you were talking to Jae Keun...

976
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,060
About what?

977
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:36,029
He said that you said, "You're cute."

978
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:37,170
Is that true?

979
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:38,630
- Jae Keun said that? - Yes.

980
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:39,970
Why?

981
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,910
He said that you said that. Is he wrong?

982
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:45,770
I never said that.

983
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,210
- Really? - Yes.

984
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,880
(Thinking)

985
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:51,810
- Did you hear about that? - About what?

986
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:54,649
- Jin Ju said to Jae Keun - Yes?

987
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:55,950
That he was cute.

988
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,190
Seriously?

989
00:46:57,890 --> 00:46:59,920
When Jin Ju complimented me,

990
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:03,060
she rarely said that I was handsome or that she liked me.

991
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:06,630
I could never imagine her saying that to me.

992
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:09,299
(Scoffing)

993
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:11,429
She seems different all of a sudden.

994
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:12,700
Yeah?

995
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:15,770
Then, what was that about?

996
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:18,870
Why? I never said that.

997
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:20,140
- Really? - Yes.

998
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:26,010
(Jae Keun and Jin Ju were talking in private last night.)

999
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:28,320
You're cute.

1000
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,190
Why are you so cute?

1001
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:35,090
- Oh, my. - She said it twice!

1002
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,029
She said it twice!

1003
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:38,090
She did say it!

1004
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:40,099
She said something that she never said to him...

1005
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:41,600
- to another guy? - To another guy.

1006
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,400
That would be upsetting.

1007
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:46,799
I never said that.

1008
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:47,870
- Really? - Yes.

1009
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:49,810
- How did that happen? - I guess I was misinformed.

1010
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:53,940
(The conversation stops for a moment, )

1011
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:56,349
(and Jae Keun notices them.)

1012
00:47:56,350 --> 00:47:58,049
I could hear what they were saying.

1013
00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:00,850
But the conversation stopped for a moment,

1014
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:02,520
so I wondered what that was about.

1015
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:06,890
(Sang Gyeong gently stares at Jin Ju.)

1016
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,190
What is it?

1017
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:12,929
I was just looking.

1018
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:14,959
(I was just looking.)

1019
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,169
I was wavering,

1020
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:20,070
so I'm sure he was suffering.

1021
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:23,110
It was written all over his face.

1022
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,940
I was so worried about that.

1023
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,380
So much must be happening in his head.

1024
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:32,309
(After the breakfast date...)

1025
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:34,580
Joo Hee made it clear to me.

1026
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:36,520
In a good way.

1027
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:38,289
She said, "You waited for so long."

1028
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:40,359
(Jae Yeon brags about getting Joo Hee's confirmation.)

1029
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,559
- He has to brag. - Yes.

1030
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,429
- He must be dying to. - He needs to spread the word.

1031
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:44,690
He should.

1032
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:47,660
(The women's lounge)

1033
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:50,769
It's been Number 7 or Number 24 the whole time.

1034
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:53,570
And after the talk...

1035
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:58,840
Who is Joo Hee interested in?

1036
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:02,640
I was worried, and I felt a bit pressured.

1037
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:05,350
So...

1038
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:07,550
Anyway...

1039
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,849
(What is she trying to say?)

1040
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:13,420
What were you thinking when you chose your date today?

1041
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:16,330
- A guy who will... - Yes.

1042
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:18,789
Make me feel comfortable when we get married.

1043
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:20,930
Number 24 makes me comfortable.

1044
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:22,700
- Really? - Yes.

1045
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:25,769
I tried to picture my marriage with Number 24,

1046
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:27,900
but I couldn't.

1047
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:31,240
So, I assumed we weren't a good fit.

1048
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:32,409
Here's my thing.

1049
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:34,779
Number 24 makes me feel...

1050
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:38,410
reassured as if we're husband and wife.

1051
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:40,849
- He's dependable, - Right.

1052
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:41,920
So to speak.

1053
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:46,460
That's how he made me feel.

1054
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,420
- He only goes for one. - He does.

1055
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,559
In the potential proposal vote,

1056
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,629
- he only chose Jin Ju. - Right.

1057
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:54,660
(He only chose Jin Ju.)

1058
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:58,230
Do you feel bitter? No?

1059
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:01,400
No, it's a load off my mind.

1060
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:04,070
I'm so happy now that I've got nothing to worry about.

1061
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:07,279
Joo Hee said, "It's a load off my mind."

1062
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,680
"I only have eyes for Number Seven now."

1063
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:11,280
But she is still a threat to me.

1064
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:15,079
I can tell that they're bothered by each other.

1065
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,820
(They still seem to be conscious of each other.)

1066
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:19,189
(The men's lounge)

1067
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:21,090
Sang Gyeong, who do you feel like you connect with?

1068
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:23,359
Or are you interested in everyone a bit?

1069
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:26,259
I can't tell if they're being sincere.

1070
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:27,330
I see.

1071
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,500
I'm quite confused.

1072
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:35,000
Jin Ju has been picking me this whole time,

1073
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,609
but she picked two yesterday.

1074
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:38,610
Who was the other one?

1075
00:50:38,611 --> 00:50:40,709
Me and Jae Keun.

1076
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:41,740
Oh, right.

1077
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:44,510
I'm sorry.

1078
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:46,009
(Jin Ju gave Sang Gyeong a vote...)

1079
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:47,120
(in the final potential proposal vote...)

1080
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,890
(and another one to Jae Keun.)

1081
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:52,520
That really surprised me.

1082
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:55,360
Maybe I didn't reassure her enough.

1083
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,259
I see.

1084
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:01,460
And last night, I remember Joo Hee...

1085
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,870
asking me to have breakfast with her today.

1086
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:07,140
- Really? - Yes.

1087
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,810
But she ate with Jae Yeon.

1088
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:12,470
So, I don't think any of them is sincere.

1089
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,580
He's deeply hurt.

1090
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:20,250
I can't tell who's being sincere.

1091
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:23,290
I just wanted to get to know Joo Hee better,

1092
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:25,320
so maybe I should at least talk to her.

1093
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:30,430
(After thinking for a while...)

1094
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:33,090
- What's going on? - He's off.

1095
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,899
To Joo Hee or Jin Ju?

1096
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:36,029
(Where is Sang Gyeong going?)

1097
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:37,130
Where is he going?

1098
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:40,639
(Everyone is in the communal lounge.)

1099
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:41,899
I saw.

1100
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,139
- You did? - What is it?

1101
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:47,340
Something good happened to Jae Yeon.

1102
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:49,610
Did I look happy in the morning?

1103
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:51,280
Of course.

1104
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:52,580
(He can't help but smile.)

1105
00:51:52,581 --> 00:51:53,750
Of course I'm happy.

1106
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,780
He's smiling brightly.

1107
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:57,919
He can smile because Joo Hee...

1108
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,450
gave him assurance.

1109
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:00,760
It's the end of his worries.

1110
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:03,229
(Jae Yeon has come for Joo Hee.)

1111
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:04,259
Where is she?

1112
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:05,530
(But she's nowhere to be seen?)

1113
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:07,000
Joo Hee's not in there.

1114
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:08,130
No, she's in there.

1115
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,270
What? Where is she?

1116
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:14,639
(Joo Hee has suddenly disappeared.)

1117
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,940
Where did Joo Hee go?

1118
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:19,210
Joo Hee wasn't in there.

1119
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:20,280
Right?

1120
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:22,210
Where did Joo Hee go?

1121
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,780
Stop it. You're making me anxious again.

1122
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:27,850
Where did you go?

1123
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:30,550
(Jae Yeon keeps looking for Joo Hee.)

1124
00:52:30,551 --> 00:52:31,590
Where did she go?

1125
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:34,159
Joo Hee has disappeared.

1126
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,520
- Disappeared? - Yes.

1127
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:38,359
Have you seen Joo Hee around?

1128
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,999
- No. - No?

1129
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,700
- No. - Where did she go?

1130
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:43,770
Is she not upstairs?

1131
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:46,899
(Meanwhile, Sang Gyeong is waiting in the car.)

1132
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:47,900
What?

1133
00:52:47,901 --> 00:52:50,470
(At that moment, someone gets in the car.)

1134
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:53,170
- Aren't you cold? - I'm cold.

1135
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:54,779
- Don't you have a jacket? - No.

1136
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:55,809
Is that a date?

1137
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:58,750
Goodness. It's these two.

1138
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:03,179
I couldn't grasp why Joo Hee did that,

1139
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,890
so I wanted to talk with her.

1140
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:08,319
Sang Gyeong wants to ask in person.

1141
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:09,960
(Sang Gyeong and Joo Hee go on an outdoor date.)

1142
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:14,500
She disappeared after breakfast.

1143
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,160
I thought, "What do I do?"

1144
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:19,069
Oh, no. Jae Yeon is...

1145
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:21,600
looking for Joo Hee in the single zone.

1146
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:25,269
It's Jin Ju.

1147
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:28,810
(Jin Ju heads to the men's lounge.)

1148
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:31,610
- Hi. - Hi.

1149
00:53:32,110 --> 00:53:33,210
Hi.

1150
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,750
She must've come because Jae Keun was on her mind.

1151
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:38,250
Your outfit today is...

1152
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:39,989
- You look very tall. - She's Dark Jin Ju today.

1153
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:42,490
- Exactly. I'm Dark Jin Ju. - Dark Jin Ju?

1154
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,190
I've become dark.

1155
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:47,259
Let's talk.

1156
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:48,960
(Let's talk.)

1157
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:52,999
I wanted to hold a serious conversation...

1158
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,399
but couldn't...

1159
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:58,410
due to the timing and such. We needed a serious conversation.

1160
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:01,809
They couldn't talk because they ate breakfast...

1161
00:54:01,810 --> 00:54:03,379
- with a different partner. - Right.

1162
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:05,850
- It's about time they talk. - I agree.

1163
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:07,950
It's my first outdoor date.

1164
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:09,720
- I know. - I'm quite...

1165
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:11,449
- nervous right now. - Are you?

1166
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:12,720
I have high expectations.

1167
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,219
You're very stylish.

1168
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:17,229
- Me? - Yes.

1169
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:19,830
Really? I'm relieved.

1170
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:23,099
We alternated between formal and informal speech.

1171
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:24,569
Did I speak casually after drinking yesterday?

1172
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:25,700
- We did. - Right?

1173
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:29,440
(The two had a conversation in the single zone.)

1174
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:30,570
(The time I spent with you...)

1175
00:54:30,571 --> 00:54:32,240
(You?)

1176
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:35,210
(The two naturally dropped the honorifics.)

1177
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:37,850
- Right? - We've been casual since then.

1178
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:41,149
I hope the day passes really slowly today.

1179
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:42,150
The time?

1180
00:54:42,151 --> 00:54:43,619
I want it to stop.

1181
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:44,820
- Completely? - Yes.

1182
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,790
I kind of get how you feel.

1183
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:49,959
Before going outside,

1184
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,429
I had more feelings for Sang Gyeong.

1185
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:53,830
But technically, Jae Keun...

1186
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:56,870
is a charming puppy with the style I adore.

1187
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,830
I don't know.

1188
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,869
(They arrive at a popular dating spot.)

1189
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:04,670
I love Seongsu.

1190
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:07,740
I'm a bit cold.

1191
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:09,339
- Are you? - Yes.

1192
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:10,549
- Here. - Okay.

1193
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:11,949
(Jae Keun takes his coat off.)

1194
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:13,179
- You can wear it. - Really?

1195
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:14,180
The two suit each other.

1196
00:55:14,181 --> 00:55:15,319
- It's like they're dating. - Thank you.

1197
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:17,489
- Drape it over your shoulders. - Thank you.

1198
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:18,519
You look pretty.

1199
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,520
It's like you're at an awards ceremony.

1200
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:21,690
- Really? - Yes.

1201
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:23,629
Had it been Sang Gyeong,

1202
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:25,860
he would've kept his jacket saying he's colder.

1203
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:29,060
- I can imagine it. - Right?

1204
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:31,999
- It's nice to come outside. - Totally.

1205
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,939
- Right? - I'm quite excited.

1206
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:35,969
- Same here. I'm getting excited. - I'm excited.

1207
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:37,110
I'll walk on this side.

1208
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:39,340
He's being a gentleman by walking on the other side.

1209
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,779
While walking around the area,

1210
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:43,549
I thought if I were to date him,

1211
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:45,250
it would be what I had always dreamed of.

1212
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:48,880
We felt like an actual couple then.

1213
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:50,250
It was fun.

1214
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:53,289
(Jae Keun and Jin Ju enjoy the outdoor date.)

1215
00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:54,420
- Everything looks good. - Right?

1216
00:55:55,290 --> 00:55:57,060
What's your favorite cuisine?

1217
00:55:57,130 --> 00:55:58,629
Like Korean, Chinese, and Japanese.

1218
00:55:58,630 --> 00:55:59,930
I love Korean cuisine.

1219
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,300
- Korean cuisine is my favorite. - Me too.

1220
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:05,430
When I talk to you, Jae Keun Jae Keun,

1221
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:08,439
- we have so much in common. - It scares me.

1222
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:09,840
It's like I'm looking at a mirror.

1223
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:10,970
Like this?

1224
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:12,269
(The two are drawn to each other more.)

1225
00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:13,710
The two look very happy.

1226
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:15,810
What's your ideal type?

1227
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:19,380
My ideal type is... I really like Seo Ji Hye.

1228
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:22,480
I've liked her style since I was young.

1229
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:26,789
Someone with long, straight black hair.

1230
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:29,559
And you're very much like that.

1231
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,059
- Really? - Yes, really.

1232
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:32,390
You give off a similar vibe.

1233
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,059
Jae Keun gave her a slight hint...

1234
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:37,800
- that she was his ideal type. - Totally.

1235
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:42,540
Jae Keun's ideal type is me.

1236
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:45,070
It made my heart flutter.

1237
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:47,340
- Actually, - Yes?

1238
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:50,649
I have a clear physical ideal type.

1239
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:53,850
Who would be your 1st choice among the 30 men?

1240
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:56,320
That would be you.

1241
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:58,090
- Really? - Yes.

1242
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:02,289
It was my compulsory condition.

1243
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:03,960
Yes, the lips.

1244
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:09,360
But...

1245
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:13,539
the one who went against that condition was that person.

1246
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:15,300
- Right. - Either way,

1247
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:18,410
after meeting everyone, evaluating them all,

1248
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:20,509
and talking to them,

1249
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:22,680
my first choice was Number 24.

1250
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:26,950
But my first choice when it came to looks...

1251
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:28,520
was you.

1252
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:32,720
Jae Keun has plump lips.

1253
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:34,790
By the way,

1254
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:38,230
where did you spend all your money on?

1255
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:39,860
I've been curious.

1256
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:41,700
Are we getting realistic now?

1257
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:44,069
My salary isn't that low.

1258
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:45,429
Yes, your salary's pretty high,

1259
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:48,570
but the money you have saved isn't much at all.

1260
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,239
Where did you spend it all?

1261
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:52,609
It's important, isn't it?

1262
00:57:52,610 --> 00:57:54,140
You didn't bring this up back then.

1263
00:57:55,710 --> 00:57:57,610
(During Day 1 of Palace Week's marriage-focused date)

1264
00:57:57,850 --> 00:58:01,250
I don't have much cash saved up at the moment.

1265
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:04,750
I have about 20,000 dollars.

1266
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:06,820
(I see.)

1267
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:10,120
She seems shocked at the unexpectedly low amount.

1268
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:11,390
"I see."

1269
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:13,859
Does Jae Keun have a lot of hobbies?

1270
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:15,200
What does he spend money on?

1271
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:18,429
Back then, I could overlook everything.

1272
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:20,239
But realistically speaking,

1273
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,569
- True. - it must be brought up once.

1274
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:24,370
While transferring to a new company,

1275
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:25,709
I took a long break...

1276
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:29,140
- and spent a lot of my savings. - You spent it?

1277
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:30,409
During that period,

1278
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:32,980
I had the mindset that you only live once.

1279
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:36,379
I'm here to find a husband.

1280
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:39,419
"Why do you only have 20,000 dollars at your age?"

1281
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:42,189
"Why didn't you save up? What's the reason behind it?"

1282
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:43,990
We had such a conversation.

1283
00:58:44,890 --> 00:58:47,400
I did some realistic thinking.

1284
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:50,059
Once this show ends,

1285
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:51,630
you'll go back to Japan, right?

1286
00:58:51,870 --> 00:58:54,799
- That has become... - Right.

1287
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,070
An important factor to think about.

1288
00:58:57,210 --> 00:58:59,670
I have my job and career.

1289
00:58:59,810 --> 00:59:01,780
I can't just quit my job...

1290
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,350
and move overseas before getting married.

1291
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:07,650
I have to consider the overall factors.

1292
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:10,390
As you said,

1293
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:12,750
I live in Japan at the moment.

1294
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:15,490
For example, even if I come to Korea often,

1295
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,989
it'll be once every two months...

1296
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:21,059
and for 1 or 2 weeks at the maximum.

1297
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:24,600
Is that something you can overcome?

1298
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:26,070
I'm not...

1299
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,870
the type who likes long-distance relationships.

1300
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:34,810
In the beginning, as we chatted with interest in one another,

1301
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,639
- Right. - you said,

1302
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,409
- "I like Japan." - I remember.

1303
00:59:38,410 --> 00:59:40,349
- "I could go to Japan." - "I could go."

1304
00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:42,720
- Even I said I could come to Korea. - Right.

1305
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:46,750
But if we want to make this a serious relationship,

1306
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:49,990
we must think about that too.

1307
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:54,129
I'd love to satisfy your condition in that part,

1308
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:55,700
but I'm in no situation to do so.

1309
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:57,929
I see the whole picture too,

1310
00:59:57,930 --> 01:00:00,900
including the other party's conditions.

1311
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:06,510
Like, "Can I have a stable future with this person?"

1312
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:11,510
It could be an obstacle to starting a relationship.

1313
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:15,780
(The two face real-world problems.)

1314
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,789
Regarding that,

1315
01:00:17,790 --> 01:00:19,989
had I been more competent,

1316
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:23,060
I would've said I could quit my job right away.

1317
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:25,890
"I'm rich."

1318
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:30,330
"I can work in the rental business."

1319
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:33,969
I want to act cool like that,

1320
01:00:33,970 --> 01:00:35,970
but I can't.

1321
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:38,140
I feel terrible about it.

1322
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:43,239
As a man, there's an aspect I can't take responsibility for.

1323
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,810
Realistically,

1324
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:47,650
there are times when I feel small.

1325
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:51,190
I could understand her.

1326
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:55,960
When it comes to the situation and conditions,

1327
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:59,359
I'm nowhere close to Sang Gyeong.

1328
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,760
And he has a great personality.

1329
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:04,470
He's perfect in every aspect.

1330
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:06,570
Here's what I think.

1331
01:01:06,571 --> 01:01:08,570
Regardless of the decision I make today,

1332
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,769
- someone will get hurt. - True.

1333
01:01:10,770 --> 01:01:13,470
- That makes me very uncomfortable. - Right.

1334
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:16,180
But I'm scared the one I chose would get hurt too.

1335
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:21,349
The fact that I might even upset...

1336
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:24,520
the one I choose worries me.

1337
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,730
I'm getting emotional.

1338
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:33,030
It feels wrong.

1339
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:39,500
I think it's inevitable that the person I don't choose...

1340
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,340
- will get hurt. - Right.

1341
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,139
But what if the decision I make...

1342
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:47,980
ends up hurting the person I choose too?

1343
01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:50,209
It'll be upsetting for him too...

1344
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:52,110
if he thinks I chose him for his conditions.

1345
01:01:54,650 --> 01:01:56,980
I clearly have fun when I'm with you.

1346
01:01:57,090 --> 01:01:59,949
I don't have to force myself to be enthusiastic.

1347
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:02,460
- Me too. - But the other person...

1348
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:04,759
Saying this to you feels wrong,

1349
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:06,690
- It's okay. - but when I'm with him,

1350
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:09,159
I feel comfortable and reassured.

1351
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:12,699
It's like he's a prepared husband.

1352
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:16,040
Either way, I'm attracted to you both.

1353
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:20,240
If I leave it to my emotions, I'd go for it.

1354
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:24,180
But can I take responsibility?

1355
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:26,010
Do I have the right?

1356
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:28,720
That's what's important.

1357
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:34,190
More than anyone else,

1358
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:36,260
I want you to be happy.

1359
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:38,260
That's why...

1360
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:40,030
What's this?

1361
01:02:44,330 --> 01:02:47,569
Why are we both crying on a date?

1362
01:02:47,570 --> 01:02:48,570
What is this?

1363
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:53,640
(The two get emotional knowing how each other feels.)

1364
01:02:56,580 --> 01:02:58,779
My feelings ran a lot deeper...

1365
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:02,049
than I thought it did.

1366
01:03:02,050 --> 01:03:05,750
You're an extremely nice person,

1367
01:03:06,490 --> 01:03:09,189
and my wish is for you to be happy.

1368
01:03:09,190 --> 01:03:11,990
(I want you to be happy.)

1369
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:18,570
He said he wanted me to be happy.

1370
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:21,569
He's a warm-hearted person,

1371
01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:24,640
and his feelings for me are sincere.

1372
01:03:25,570 --> 01:03:29,380
I could feel his earnestness.

1373
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:32,280
It made me more uneasy.

1374
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:35,549
(The two face deeper dilemmas.)

1375
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:36,550
How upsetting.

1376
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:39,719
Jin Ju has a lot more to think about now.

1377
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,520
She has to choose between...

1378
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:43,990
Jae Keun, who she's attracted to,

1379
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:46,430
and Sang Gyeong, who's more reassuring.

1380
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:53,300
(Single zone)

1381
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:58,640
Male Number 26, Lee Jung Won,

1382
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:02,340
will move from the couple zone to the single zone.

1383
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:05,409
(Everyone is shocked by Jung Won's news.)

1384
01:04:05,410 --> 01:04:07,879
What? Hold on. What's going on?

1385
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:09,280
I got goosebumps.

1386
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:10,820
Jung Won has returned.

1387
01:04:11,350 --> 01:04:13,549
Jung Won will move from the couple zone..

1388
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:14,559
To the single zone.

1389
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:15,959
(Seung Yeon hears the news about Jung Won.)

1390
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,330
Seung Yeon's face is like, "He's actually back."

1391
01:04:17,630 --> 01:04:18,959
He kept his promise.

1392
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,489
He came back right after their conversation.

1393
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:21,900
She must be so moved.

1394
01:04:24,270 --> 01:04:28,770
(Jung Won and Sin Da chose the single zone again.)

1395
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,540
We decided to return to the single zone.

1396
01:04:35,810 --> 01:04:38,980
Not telling me until he got Number 21's commitment...

1397
01:04:39,350 --> 01:04:41,580
is really wicked.

1398
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:47,620
I could see that Sin Da was very shocked.

1399
01:04:51,230 --> 01:04:54,360
I feel stupid to have become a couple.

1400
01:04:57,700 --> 01:05:01,240
I feel terrible and heavy-hearted.

1401
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:08,110
But I will trust and follow...

1402
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:11,810
my heart until the end.

1403
01:05:13,850 --> 01:05:17,250
Lee Jung Won is entering the single zone.

1404
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:25,030
- Sir? - Why are you back?

1405
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:26,960
Why did you come back?

1406
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:28,160
- Hi. - I got goosebumps.

1407
01:05:28,161 --> 01:05:30,400
- Why... - Hello.

1408
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:34,540
I feel out of sorts about this situation,

1409
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:36,100
but I'm happy to see you.

1410
01:05:38,110 --> 01:05:40,309
- Many things... - Did many things happen?

1411
01:05:40,310 --> 01:05:41,310
May I ask what happened?

1412
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:45,310
- I can't tell you. - Is that so?

1413
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:48,619
He should go straight to Seung Yeon.

1414
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:49,620
Exactly.

1415
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:52,719
- Here he comes. - He's coming.

1416
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,660
(Jung Won walks over to Seung Yeon.)

1417
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:56,590
For the time being...

1418
01:05:58,530 --> 01:06:01,030
(Seung Yeon smiles brightly the moment she sees Jung Won.)

1419
01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:02,760
My gosh.

1420
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:08,340
- What? - I'm going to go talk with him.

1421
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:16,310
I didn't think you'd come back right away.

1422
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:18,210
There was no reason to hesitate.

1423
01:06:21,450 --> 01:06:25,050
I'm not going to hold on to you today.

1424
01:06:26,090 --> 01:06:29,360
Hold on to me.

1425
01:06:34,330 --> 01:06:35,500
I'm happy...

1426
01:06:37,230 --> 01:06:38,430
that you came.

1427
01:06:40,270 --> 01:06:41,270
I'm...

1428
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,470
- also happy to be seeing you again. - Okay.

1429
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:47,980
I did everything I could.

1430
01:06:52,350 --> 01:06:53,979
(The studio has gone wild because of Jung Won's line.)

1431
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:54,980
What?

1432
01:06:54,981 --> 01:06:56,879
That line. It was like from a drama.

1433
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:57,890
It made my heart race.

1434
01:06:58,150 --> 01:06:59,520
- "I did everything I could." - "I did everything I could."

1435
01:07:04,490 --> 01:07:06,189
- She's here. - She's here.

1436
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:10,330
(Sin Da has returned to the single zone.)

1437
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:17,200
Female Number 9, Oh Sin Da,

1438
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:20,880
will move from the couple zone to the single zone.

1439
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:24,480
It was really wicked.

1440
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:28,180
He was never meant for me.

1441
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:31,490
- Excuse me. - Okay.

1442
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:34,459
I'm back.

1443
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:36,620
(Sin Da is back in the single zone.)

1444
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:38,790
I'm back.

1445
01:07:39,230 --> 01:07:42,060
He's all yours.

1446
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:44,770
- "I'm back." - "I'm back."

1447
01:07:44,870 --> 01:07:46,600
As expected of Sin Da.

1448
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:47,940
It's like an American drama.

1449
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:50,570
I'm back.

1450
01:07:50,910 --> 01:07:52,240
He's all yours.

1451
01:07:52,370 --> 01:07:54,180
- Hi. - Hi.

1452
01:07:57,210 --> 01:07:58,649
Jung Won must feel bad.

1453
01:07:58,650 --> 01:07:59,650
(Sin Da heads to the women's lounge without acknowledging Jung Won)

1454
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:02,720
Everyone's here.

1455
01:08:02,721 --> 01:08:04,890
Hi. Nice to see you again.

1456
01:08:07,590 --> 01:08:08,620
Hold on.

1457
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,360
I'm losing it.

1458
01:08:13,430 --> 01:08:14,860
Oh, no.

1459
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:17,869
Why are you back so quickly?

1460
01:08:17,870 --> 01:08:20,899
Someone fooled me.

1461
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:22,200
What? Who?

1462
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,939
Isn't it obvious? It was my partner.

1463
01:08:24,940 --> 01:08:26,240
You... What?

1464
01:08:27,710 --> 01:08:29,840
You have this gut feeling, right?

1465
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:32,409
I asked him out of the blue today.

1466
01:08:32,410 --> 01:08:35,820
"If you could pick someone else, who would you pick?"

1467
01:08:36,050 --> 01:08:37,079
He said Seung Yeon.

1468
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:39,220
Then I said, "Bye."

1469
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:41,020
You think...

1470
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:44,630
Jung Won has more feelings for Seung Yeon, right?

1471
01:08:46,330 --> 01:08:49,130
I think he always had Seung Yeon on his mind.

1472
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:52,500
I heard she gave him one of her votes yesterday.

1473
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:54,240
After receiving it,

1474
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:57,770
he saw a possibility with Seung Yeon and...

1475
01:08:57,870 --> 01:09:00,769
- Did he seem happy? - I've been curious about Jung Won.

1476
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:02,079
I wanted to chat with him.

1477
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:03,680
That's why I voted for him.

1478
01:09:04,110 --> 01:09:05,380
Seung Yeon must stay in the game.

1479
01:09:06,150 --> 01:09:08,380
In the first place,

1480
01:09:08,850 --> 01:09:11,050
if I'm not the first choice of my partner...

1481
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:14,189
- I get it. - No matter how big my feelings are,

1482
01:09:14,190 --> 01:09:15,720
- I can't if I'm not. - Same here.

1483
01:09:16,090 --> 01:09:17,090
It's a goodbye.

1484
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:20,829
(Seung Yeon gets up as if uncomfortable.)

1485
01:09:20,830 --> 01:09:22,030
Where is she going? Where is Seung Yeon going?

1486
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:25,400
- Sin Da... - Is she moving next to her?

1487
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:28,600
I like Jung Won.

1488
01:09:29,570 --> 01:09:30,570
A bit.

1489
01:09:32,170 --> 01:09:33,170
Go ahead.

1490
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:36,509
It's not like you hit on him.

1491
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:39,150
It's him who has feelings for you.

1492
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:42,019
If a man changes his heart because he got hit on,

1493
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:43,719
he was never meant for me from the start.

1494
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:45,390
- That's true. - Right?

1495
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:49,419
That's why I'm very annoyed by him.

1496
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:51,829
- He... - Did he put you off?

1497
01:09:51,830 --> 01:09:53,260
Yes, he put me off.

1498
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:55,160
I'm not some insurance.

1499
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:03,370
(Meanwhile, Jung Won is...)

1500
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:06,810
I feel heavy-hearted. I really do.

1501
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:10,579
(Roaming around the single zone without a word)

1502
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:12,949
He made the decision after much thought.

1503
01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:14,209
He must overcome it...

1504
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:16,020
if he wants to win a good person.

1505
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:18,720
Sit, Jung Won.

1506
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:22,060
What's wrong?

1507
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:26,330
I thought I'd feel better if I came here.

1508
01:10:26,530 --> 01:10:27,530
Do you feel uncomfortable?

1509
01:10:27,630 --> 01:10:29,630
It's an uncomfortable yet fun place.

1510
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:32,230
It's natural that I'm uncomfortable.

1511
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:37,970
I felt too bad to talk to her.

1512
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:41,380
Now, the problem is Sin Da.

1513
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:43,580
Will Ji Woong come for her or not?

1514
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:46,080
Ji Woong? He will.

1515
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:47,750
Is he already there?

1516
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:49,650
Ji Woong will definitely come.

1517
01:10:53,490 --> 01:10:54,490
Come here.

1518
01:10:56,790 --> 01:10:57,790
What now?

1519
01:10:57,791 --> 01:11:00,830
Ji Woong said I would be his first choice...

1520
01:11:00,930 --> 01:11:02,330
if he weren't a couple.

1521
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:05,300
He's drawn to my appearance the most as well.

1522
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:09,770
(Sin Da asked Ji Woong outright during the secret date.)

1523
01:11:09,870 --> 01:11:11,040
(If you weren't here, )

1524
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:13,710
(you would naturally be my first choice.)

1525
01:11:13,810 --> 01:11:16,210
(Sin Da got confirmation that she was his first choice.)

1526
01:11:16,410 --> 01:11:20,180
But he's not certain about his current partner.

1527
01:11:21,850 --> 01:11:24,720
Right now, I feel unsure.

1528
01:11:26,090 --> 01:11:29,020
What should I do to keep you with me?

1529
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:31,790
Let's go to the single zone together.

1530
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:34,290
I don't know what's on your mind yet.

1531
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:37,099
Of course, he'll come. It's guaranteed.

1532
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:38,200
- You think so? - Yes.

1533
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:40,070
We can just break up.

1534
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:42,070
But that'd break my heart.

1535
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:45,970
He's persuading her to move to the single zone.

1536
01:11:46,910 --> 01:11:49,480
This might be our last time together.

1537
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:54,110
Still, I only want to think about you.

1538
01:11:54,150 --> 01:11:55,980
Poor Ha Yeon.

1539
01:11:57,150 --> 01:11:59,150
- Do you think he'll come down? - Of course.

1540
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:01,759
(What will Ji Woong decide to do?)

1541
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:03,020
What? Is he...

1542
01:12:03,190 --> 01:12:04,629
He can't do that.

1543
01:12:04,630 --> 01:12:06,190
- What? - No, it can't be.

1544
01:12:08,030 --> 01:12:09,130
What were you doing?

1545
01:12:09,330 --> 01:12:10,900
Did you talk to the men?

1546
01:12:12,170 --> 01:12:14,229
I haven't seen Male Number 24 around.

1547
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:15,239
Me neither.

1548
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:17,200
Male Number 24 is on a date.

1549
01:12:17,670 --> 01:12:19,239
- With Female Number 18? - Yes.

1550
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:20,439
(Did he go on a date with Joo Hee?)

1551
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:22,380
- Did he go on a date with her? - Yes, they had wine.

1552
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:23,839
They had wine? Okay.

1553
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,450
(They drank by themselves?)

1554
01:12:25,810 --> 01:12:27,550
This morning,

1555
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:30,449
I didn't make it clear for Male Number 24.

1556
01:12:30,450 --> 01:12:34,620
I acted like, "I'm going to betray you."

1557
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:36,219
What did you say?

1558
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:38,489
"I'm going to turn dark today. Don't let it hurt you."

1559
01:12:38,490 --> 01:12:39,959
"I'm going to do whatever I like."

1560
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:41,130
- That's what I said. - Okay.

1561
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:43,860
I'm wearing black. I'm going to turn dark today.

1562
01:12:44,530 --> 01:12:46,230
I'm going to do everything I want.

1563
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:48,500
That's scary.

1564
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:51,669
He looked upset.

1565
01:12:51,670 --> 01:12:52,810
But the problem is...

1566
01:12:53,510 --> 01:12:56,009
we haven't talked since we made our choices yesterday.

1567
01:12:56,010 --> 01:12:57,979
And he talked to Joo Hee for two hours...

1568
01:12:57,980 --> 01:12:59,049
- yesterday. - Yes.

1569
01:12:59,050 --> 01:13:00,949
- They went out again today. - Yes.

1570
01:13:00,950 --> 01:13:02,749
So I never know what's going to happen.

1571
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:03,820
But...

1572
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:05,319
Did something happen?

1573
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:06,650
(Joo Hee enters the women's lounge.)

1574
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:08,659
That's scary.

1575
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:10,119
(The atmosphere changes in the single zone...)

1576
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:11,160
(with Joo Hee's arrival.)

1577
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:14,659
She's planning to choose Sang Gyeong...

1578
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:16,230
- if I choose Jae Keun, right? - Yes.

1579
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:21,640
Then it's guaranteed.

1580
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:23,699
But it could be...

1581
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:25,839
that she just wants what she doesn't have.

1582
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:27,639
- Yes. - You know what I mean?

1583
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:29,509
- That could be it too. - Yes.

1584
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:30,710
Sometimes I feel that way too.

1585
01:13:35,980 --> 01:13:36,980
Exactly.

1586
01:13:36,981 --> 01:13:38,950
I can't stand to watch them working it out.

1587
01:13:39,490 --> 01:13:40,490
What?

1588
01:13:40,491 --> 01:13:42,319
(To be continued)

1589
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:43,990
Jin Ju turned dark.

1590
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:47,129
(What happened to Soo Min last night?)

1591
01:13:47,130 --> 01:13:48,459
(So obnoxious.)

1592
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:50,059
(Yeong Seok's channel's going crazy.)

1593
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:51,869
(Underlying tension between Sang Gyeong and Jae Keun?)

1594
01:13:51,870 --> 01:13:53,199
(But I have thin lips.)

1595
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:54,539
(When Sang Gyeong was smiling, )

1596
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:56,499
(his mouth looked so big.)

1597
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:57,599
(Will he come down to the single zone?)

1598
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:58,610
(They don't have much time left until the final proposal.)

1599
01:13:58,970 --> 01:14:00,739
(I want to be reevaluated in the single zone.)

1600
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:02,009
(Have you heard?)

1601
01:14:02,010 --> 01:14:03,080
Gosh, my head.

1602
01:14:03,310 --> 01:14:04,649
(Should I say I have feelings left for her?)

1603
01:14:04,650 --> 01:14:06,150
(They're talking every time they have a chance.)

1604
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:07,610
(Did Ye Rin finally lose it?)

1605
01:14:08,350 --> 01:14:10,479
(What's on Kyung Seok's mind?)

1606
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:11,849
(Did you choose Jae Yeon because you felt bad?)

1607
01:14:11,850 --> 01:14:14,019
(He showed me that I could trust him.)

1608
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:15,320
(Joo Hee will stick to Jae Yeon.)

1609
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:16,619
(I just need to wait a little more.)

1610
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:18,229
(1 day left before the final proposal)

1611
01:14:18,230 --> 01:14:19,430
(They can only choose one.)

1612
01:14:19,660 --> 01:14:21,860
(They can't delay their decisions anymore.)

1613
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:27,899
(Leave?)

1614
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:29,499
(It'd be a good idea to leave.)

1615
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:31,069
(What do you think?)

1616
01:14:31,070 --> 01:14:33,410
(I think we need to stop.)

1617
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:38,980
(What happened to them the day before the proposal?)
