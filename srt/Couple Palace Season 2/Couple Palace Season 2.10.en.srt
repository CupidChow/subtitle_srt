1
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,880
(COUPLE PALACE 2)

2
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,049
(A journey to get married)

3
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,190
I'm here to get married.

4
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,360
I'm going to get married no matter what.

5
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,959
I'll take this as my last chance...

6
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,830
and meet the one.

7
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,699
If I get to meet the one here,

8
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,270
it'd be like a movie.

9
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,380
(The day of the final proposal)

10
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,020
(The story until that day)

11
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,449
(The first impression)

12
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,220
I chose Female Number Ten.

13
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,459
She met my ideal type.

14
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,960
She was tall...

15
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,329
and had fair skin.

16
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,400
That's the type of person I like.

17
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,900
To be honest, I believe in destiny.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,670
The feeling that I get when I see that person.

19
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,310
My choice is Woman Number 13.

20
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,080
(They understood each other when they first met like destiny.)

21
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,640
After today,

22
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,680
my life might change.

23
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,489
(Variables)

24
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:34,190
Male Number Seven said he wouldn't choose anyone else.

25
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,590
You passed.

26
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,930
But...

27
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,600
there were unexpected variables.

28
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,000
Because I was thirsty.

29
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,169
I want to have a fun life with a fun person.

30
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,710
So I was a little swayed.

31
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,480
I'm here to get married.

32
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,640
So I can't fail.

33
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,550
(New attraction)

34
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,050
Don't you think this is wrong?

35
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,050
Do you want to go back?

36
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,320
Are you sure you won't regret it?

37
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,560
I thought it was my last chance.

38
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,230
So I asked you out on a date as soon as I was at the couple zone.

39
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,100
I also asked you out on a date.

40
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,700
To be honest, it's really amazing.

41
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,099
It's all about timing.

42
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,470
Everything feels like destiny.

43
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,970
(The last choice)

44
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,110
I never thought about not getting married.

45
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,610
And I think the time has come.

46
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,680
I wish you happiness.

47
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:41,060
Jin Ju would be the one who's most conflicted.

48
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,060
I don't know what's going to happen...

49
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,400
(But I hope she makes a choice she won't regret.)

50
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,240
COUPLE PALACE the final proposal choice.

51
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,840
Oh my gosh!

52
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,280
(The guests are here to join the last part of the journey.)

53
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,410
It's come to an end.

54
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,850
It's finally over.

55
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,149
We now have only the final proposal left.

56
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,690
Last week, the person with the hottest issue was...

57
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,689
- Jin Ju.
- It was really hot.

58
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:16,719
Yes.

59
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,389
When Sang Gyeong chose...

60
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,659
Joo Hee for the final proposal,

61
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,299
Jin Ju was shocked.

62
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,299
Yes, Joo Hee ended up...

63
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,899
telling Jae Yeon that she was getting swayed.

64
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,640
The two shed tears.

65
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,370
I can't wait to find out...

66
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,670
- Joo Hee's choice.
- I can't wait.

67
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,909
How many couples would make it together?

68
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,440
(Who will accept the final proposal?)

69
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,479
- Someone's coming.
- Oh, yes.

70
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,150
(Kim Hyun Joong, 32, L Company Employee)

71
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,550
(Lim Si Yeon, 34, fashion brand CEO)

72
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,789
(Hwang Jae Keun, 34, major Japanese company employee)

73
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,560
I guess he joined as a new resident.

74
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,090
(Seo Jin Ju, 33, banker in charge of VIPs)

75
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,700
(Lee Jung Won, 37, patent attorney slash attorney)

76
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,870
(Oh Seung Yeon, 27, musical actress)

77
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,940
(Bae Joo Hee, 28, pharmacist)

78
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,170
(Choi Jae Yeon, 29, oral surgeon)

79
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,339
They all look nice...

80
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,680
in a tux.

81
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
Nice!

82
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:14,080
They all look cool.

83
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,319
(Half nervous, half excited)

84
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,850
They must be so nervous.

85
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,519
They all look great.

86
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,589
(All 24 single men and women have arrived...)

87
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,929
Everyone's arrived.

88
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:24,960
(for the final proposal.)

89
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,130
- It's going to start now.
- Yes.

90
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,030
- It's going to be fun.
- Oh, my gosh.

91
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,770
Wait.

92
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,900
Why is the blonde lady in the guest section?

93
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,899
(Sin Da's in the guest section, not the bridal section.)

94
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,939
Didn't you enter it?

95
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,509
I was betrayed.

96
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,840
- Seriously.
- Really?

97
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,640
- What?
- No way.

98
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,909
(For the final proposal, Jung Won chose...)

99
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,779
I blame Male Number 26.

100
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,780
(Seung Yeon instead of Sin Da.)

101
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,450
I feel so betrayed.

102
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,989
Female Number Nine Oh Sin Da.

103
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:56,190
(Sin Da had to leave because she didn't get the vote.)

104
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,829
Bye.

105
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,030
- Sin Da.
- Yes?

106
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,300
- Take care.
- Best of luck.

107
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,829
In the final proposal choice,

108
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,070
- Sin Da ended up leaving.
- Oh, my gosh.

109
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,939
- That's upsetting.
- Yes, what a jerk.

110
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,410
- No wonder you're upset.
- Yes.

111
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,780
I hope everyone gets married.

112
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,240
I want to get married too.

113
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,550
We will now begin the final proposal.

114
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,050
We root for your successful marriage.

115
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,059
Now they will begin the final proposal.

116
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,460
- Finally.
- Yes.

117
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,459
They look like they still have a lot on their minds,

118
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,160
but I hope they all make a decision they won't regret.

119
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,300
The first proposal.

120
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,770
Male Number 19 Cho Yeong Seok.

121
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,910
Please come forward.

122
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,210
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

123
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,680
Female Number 13 Kim Soo Min.

124
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,750
Please come forward.

125
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,619
(The nerve-racking first proposal)

126
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,690
- Finally.
- I'm so nervous.

127
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,189
- They're certain, aren't they?
- They'll make it.

128
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,760
- They're guaranteed.
- They're guaranteed.

129
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,099
(Connected by oriental philosophy)

130
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,360
(Yeong Seok and Soo Min were certain to make it.)

131
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,170
I'm so curious about these two.

132
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,599
They became a little emotional.

133
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,639
(However, they had an emotional conflict.)

134
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,709
And they had some trouble.

135
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,910
We never know what's going to happen.

136
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,150
I thought he might not choose me.

137
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:32,890
(Soo Min talked about her problem with Yeong Seok to others.)

138
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,390
He's my ex.

139
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,560
(Soo Min mentioned her ex in front of Yeong Seok.)

140
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,390
I made a big mistake today.

141
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,760
I'm sorry.

142
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,969
I felt bad.

143
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:48,339
I drank so much. I guess I got drunk.

144
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,799
- Gosh.
- At first,

145
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,339
they were very happy.

146
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,439
But due to Soo Min's continuous mistakes,

147
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,180
Yeong Seok had a hard time.

148
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:59,050
Do you always drink until you become dead drunk?

149
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,920
(Yeong Seok's attitude toward her changed after that.)

150
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,289
- It was crazy.
- That's crazy.

151
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,850
- That's wrong.
- No wonder you fought.

152
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,260
Yes, so he's angry.

153
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,960
(The atmosphere has become cold.)

154
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,929
Soo Min's aware of her mistake.

155
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,100
She's anxious.

156
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,640
I need some water.

157
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:29,039
I want to go home.

158
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,110
I just want to rest at home.

159
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,180
- What?
- He wants to go home.

160
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,320
We have a big day tomorrow.

161
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,260
I see why you don't want to do it.

162
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,289
(Yeong Seok's thinking quietly after hearing what Soo Min said.)

163
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,760
Yeong Seok must have a lot on his mind.

164
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,970
I let you down yesterday,

165
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,200
and I know I should work on it.

166
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,970
But if you were thinking about a long-term relationship with me,

167
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,940
it would've happened one day.

168
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,450
That's who I am.

169
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,960
After seeing a new side of her,

170
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,790
I feel a little distant from her.

171
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,600
Male Number 19, Cho Yeong Seok,

172
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:24,629
will you propose...

173
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,830
to Female Number 13, Kim Soo Min?

174
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,969
The man might not propose, right?

175
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,340
If he doesn't show her the ring?

176
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,609
What kind of decision will Yeong Seok make?

177
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:39,880
(What's Yeong Seok's decision?)

178
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,920
Kim Soo Min.

179
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:49,560
When I was with you, it was relaxing, fun,

180
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,030
and joyful.

181
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,860
What? It's in past tense.

182
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,530
- Oh, no.
- What's happening?

183
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:06,010
(How does he feel about Soo Min?)

184
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,380
I think I was a little upset.

185
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,080
So...

186
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:16,450
everything that happened and the emotions I had...

187
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:20,860
I think they were something I needed to go through.

188
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,430
Were you able to draw your future with Soo Min?

189
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:25,890
Well...

190
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,030
(Do I have a future with Soo Min?)

191
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,170
Will you propose to her?

192
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,340
Kim Soo Min.

193
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,779
Will you marry me?

194
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,680
(Will you marry me?)

195
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,419
My goodness.

196
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,250
His proposal was customized for a Daegu woman.

197
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,560
I want to go home.

198
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:01,500
(Yeong Seok proposed to Soo Min.)

199
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,970
The wedding.

200
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,829
Let's be cost-effective.

201
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,229
How about at a wedding hall...

202
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,039
with a budget under 30,000 dollars?

203
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,499
That's what my cousin did.

204
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,509
My older sister also...

205
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,909
At Chungjeongro.

206
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,609
My older sister also had her wedding at Chungjeongro.

207
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,039
Was it at that building?

208
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,350
What? That's right.

209
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,950
(They get excited again for having something else in common.)

210
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,290
This definitely looks like a wedding ring.

211
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,489
(Yeong Seok and Soo Min are the perfect match.)

212
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:29,719
- That must be nice.
- They look so good together.

213
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,090
I agree.

214
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,490
You eat well.

215
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,030
Eating well is adorable.

216
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:40,670
(They were drawn more and more to each other.)

217
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:44,940
No one is perfect.

218
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,710
(And I don't think that's your fault.)

219
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:52,950
When I reflected on it calmly, I could understand.

220
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,980
I felt more certain about being with Soo Min.

221
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,720
(Yeong Seok confessed that he was sure about Soo Min.)

222
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,260
With you,

223
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,860
I believe that I'll be wiser, stronger,

224
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,360
and better.

225
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,670
And so, I accept your proposal.

226
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,909
(Congratulations.)

227
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,940
Yes.

228
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,410
That's the first couple.

229
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:24,880
They're so made for each other.

230
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,779
(Yeong Seok and Soo Min had a successful final proposal.)

231
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,020
They're such a cute couple.

232
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:39,129
I believe that such a healthy attraction is...

233
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,300
very rare.

234
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:44,730
And I met someone that rare on COUPLE PALACE.

235
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:49,070
Can you teach me how to say it in a Daegu accent?

236
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,439
- Kim Soo Min.
- Kim Soo Min.

237
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,009
(Yeong Seok learned the Daegu accent...)

238
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,639
(to propose to Soo Min who's from Daegu.)

239
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,780
Will you marry me?

240
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,209
Actually, we were quite worried for them.

241
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,449
Right,

242
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,049
but there was no need to worry.

243
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,049
Sometimes, you have to fight...

244
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,320
in order to realize your deepest feelings.

245
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,159
We thought that we'd lose a couple we were sure about,

246
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,490
- so we were very nervous.
- I know. I'm so glad.

247
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,860
- Next.
- I bet it's me.

248
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,300
- Male Number 21, Jang Kyung Seok.
- It's me.

249
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:20,970
It's Kyung Seok.

250
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,370
- Let's go.
- Good luck, Kyung Seok.

251
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,210
Kyung Seok had a lot to think about.

252
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,679
His voting result wasn't revealed last week.

253
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,910
(Kyung Seok's final proposal partner wasn't revealed last week.)

254
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,920
(During the final potential proposal vote)

255
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:40,150
(Please choose only one person.)

256
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,559
I thought about it a lot for a long time...

257
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,830
between two women.

258
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,160
Female Number 5 and 25.

259
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,159
Whom do you think Kyung Seok chose?

260
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,170
Who could it be?

261
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,599
On the first day of Palace Week,

262
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,969
I expected you to come.

263
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,709
But when I saw you, I had a mental breakdown.

264
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:02,280
A mental breakdown? I didn't think you cared about me.

265
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,050
Female Number 25 came as a catfish.

266
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,520
I was interested in her.

267
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,320
(Ye Rin avoided Kyung Seok and Soo Jin after seeing them.)

268
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:19,060
But I felt much more comfortable around Number Five.

269
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,930
I can easily tell that she's kind.

270
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,430
I thought about it a lot at that time.

271
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,839
Today, we will find out...

272
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,940
- whom Kyung Seok is drawn to.
- Right.

273
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:35,640
Female Number... please come up.

274
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,050
Who will be Kyung Seok's partner?

275
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:43,620
- Oh, my.
- What will happen now?

276
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:44,850
Who will it be?

277
00:13:44,851 --> 00:13:45,990
(What will be Kyung Seok's choice?)

278
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,660
I don't know what will happen,

279
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,660
but I really want to get married.

280
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,030
I want to get to know him more.

281
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,560
If he doesn't pick me, I'd feel disappointed.

282
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,930
- Who will it be?
- Is it Soo Jin?

283
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,969
- Ye Rin?
- What?

284
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,170
(Kyung Seok's heart goes to...)

285
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,740
Male Number 21, Jang Kyung Seok.

286
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,180
Will you propose to her?

287
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,650
You put your hair up.

288
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,280
Who is it?

289
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:17,950
Who could it be?

290
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:22,059
(Who is Kyung Seok's final proposal partner?)

291
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:26,790
Ye Rin, will you marry me?

292
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,559
It's Ye Rin.

293
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,159
(Kyung Seok chose Ye Rin.)

294
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,330
Ye Rin made it.

295
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:38,069
(Kyung Seok's short and sweet proposal to Ye Rin)

296
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:41,310
I felt sorry and grateful to Ye Rin.

297
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,980
She must have been curious about how I felt.

298
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,750
She was probably itching to ask me,

299
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,150
but I felt that she was waiting for me.

300
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,790
Female Number Five, Kim Ye Rin.

301
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,090
Please give your response.

302
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,389
Will Ye Rin accept Kyung Seok's feelings?

303
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,930
Of course she will.

304
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,599
(What will be Ye Rin's answer?)

305
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,600
I'm sorry.

306
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,530
I'm sorry.

307
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,800
(Ye Rin's response is unexpected.)

308
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,940
He must have given her a hard time.

309
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,010
(What happened to Ye Rin?)

310
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,380
(Ye Rin spotted Kyung Seok talking with Soo Jin.)

311
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,550
He's talking to her again.

312
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,120
My goodness...

313
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,520
He talks to her whenever he gets a chance.

314
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:34,600
When he asked us to understand his physical contact with women,

315
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,700
this is what he meant.

316
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:41,500
"Even if I talk often with women,"

317
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,270
"please understand."

318
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,570
I see how it is.

319
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,010
It bothered me.

320
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,710
I wondered if he really was planning on getting married.

321
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,280
I'm sorry.

322
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,689
- What are you sorry about?
- What do you mean sorry?

323
00:15:58,690 --> 00:15:59,690
(Please...)

324
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,420
(No one expected this response from Ye Rin.)

325
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,660
It's okay.

326
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:10,900
At first, I thought that you were a bad boy.

327
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
However,

328
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,670
when I gave it some thought,

329
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:20,140
I realized that you were kind and prudent.

330
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:24,710
All the moments I had with you...

331
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,150
were like a dream.

332
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,720
I don't think she's rejecting him.

333
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:35,860
I will marry you.

334
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,890
I will marry you.

335
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,929
(Ye Rin accepted Kyung Seok's proposal.)

336
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:44,430
Oh, come on.

337
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,129
She wasn't apologizing for rejecting him.

338
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,329
Right.

339
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,639
- "I'm sorry for misunderstanding." - She was apologizing...

340
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,940
for misunderstanding him as a bad boy.

341
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,410
Congratulations, Ye Rin.

342
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,609
(Kyung Seok and Ye Rin had a successful final proposal.)

343
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,910
- Were you startled?
- Yes.

344
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,679
I don't know if I should say this,

345
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,849
but Kyung Seok likes you too.

346
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:04,850
How do you know?

347
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:05,850
Earlier,

348
00:17:05,851 --> 00:17:08,720
- he couldn't eat with you.
- Yes.

349
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:12,159
You were sitting diagonal from him, so he could see you easily.

350
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,359
Really?

351
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,230
(Young Taek told her about Kyung Seok's feelings.)

352
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:18,870
I'll tell you how I feel.

353
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,940
(Kyung Seok shared his feelings for Ye Rin with Soo Jin.)

354
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,939
How do you feel about me?

355
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,279
And is there another woman on your mind?

356
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,609
There's no other woman on my mind.

357
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:36,680
I felt sure when I saw you waiting for me.

358
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,689
(Kyung Seok and Ye Rin walk down the aisle.)

359
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,889
We should really attend their wedding.

360
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,489
If they get married, we'll sing and host the wedding.

361
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:44,590
That's right.

362
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,330
Without Kyung Seok,

363
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,730
I'd have left Palace Week.

364
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,870
Every moment was precious.

365
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,869
It might be slippery.

366
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,940
Your heels might get stuck. Do you need a hand?

367
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,880
(Kyung Seok had been attentive to Ye Rin in detail.)

368
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,909
I'm starting to see it clearly again.

369
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,779
I feel happy.

370
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,449
Gosh, it's so sweet.

371
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:11,620
(Kyung Seok and Ye Rin confirmed their feelings for each other.)

372
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,150
I should've proposed better.

373
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,919
His legs are very long.

374
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,860
- Look how short his pants are.
- Gosh.

375
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,689
How would they look on Kyeong Hwan?

376
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:21,899
He can't wear them.

377
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,030
(He just laughs.)

378
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,030
Who's next?

379
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,130
Who's next?

380
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:29,970
Wasn't Male Number 3 with Female Number 19?

381
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,840
It didn't work out between them.

382
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,579
He kept showing interest in women...

383
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,980
- that no one expected.
- Right.

384
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,080
It was totally unexpected.

385
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,620
Sin Da is busy explaining to other people.

386
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,619
Next is Female Number 23, Seo Jin Ju.

387
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,890
- This fast?
- Please come up.

388
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,489
Gosh, is it me?

389
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:55,359
She was chosen by Jae Keun as his proposal partner.

390
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,000
Jin Ju is coming up.

391
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,900
- She looks beautiful.
- Princess.

392
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:04,200
(Jin Ju walks towards the wedding aisle.)

393
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,580
She must feel so nervous.

394
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:11,180
The aisle must feel very long.

395
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,290
- It must be nerve-racking.
- Of course.

396
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,050
I want to get married too.

397
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,390
Seriously.

398
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,459
I understand how Kun Hee feels.

399
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,659
When you're at someone else's wedding,

400
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,859
you want to get married too.

401
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,860
That's true.

402
00:19:27,861 --> 00:19:29,630
You say things like that before you know it.

403
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,830
The couple looks happy.

404
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,640
When I think of what happened before the day of the proposal,

405
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,770
there are things that disappointed me.

406
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,279
(The morning of the final proposal)

407
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,840
It's such a shame.

408
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,480
Seriously.

409
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,480
I should've gone to the couple zone with Male Number 24...

410
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,080
when he was the only one I was interested in.

411
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,950
She keeps regretting it.

412
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,619
He was like my partner.

413
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,160
It almost felt like he was my virtual husband.

414
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,189
I've been with Sang Gyeong...

415
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:01,930
from the very beginning of the program.

416
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:05,470
But in the end, we went our separate ways.

417
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,230
So that's disappointing.

418
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:11,170
You get all kinds of thoughts the day before the wedding.

419
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,140
I think that's how she's feeling right now.

420
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,540
Before the Palace Week,

421
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,850
this is what I told my friends.

422
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,180
"I'm going to marry a dermatologist."

423
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,179
I said, "I'll give you a discount."

424
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,220
That was my attitude when I came here last week.

425
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,820
My friends were like, "Will you get us a nice deal?"

426
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,390
I told them that I had found my husband.

427
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,590
That's just crazy.

428
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,130
She already bragged about it to her friends.

429
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,459
She already spilled the beans.

430
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,830
After everything I told my friends...

431
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,300
- That's...
- But my husband changed.

432
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:46,669
Actually, appearance-wise,

433
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:49,210
Jae Keun is my type.

434
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,679
So here are the things I look for in men.

435
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,209
Someone fit with a strong upper body...

436
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,449
and thick lips.

437
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:55,549
That's what I like.

438
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,949
And Jae Keun is totally my type.

439
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,250
But Sang Gyeong isn't.

440
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,320
I have big buttocks.

441
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,490
I've been squatting too much.

442
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,830
That's making my heart flutter.

443
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,760
You're not an ordinary man.

444
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,730
Tell me about your condition that you don't want to share the bed.

445
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,799
It's not like you hate physical intimacy, right?

446
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,940
I like physical intimacy.

447
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:20,970
- I bet.
- I do, I like it.

448
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,579
- Appearance is important too.
- Yes.

449
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,679
- Right.
- That's true.

450
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,379
There must be chemistry...

451
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,949
and she must feel attracted to him.

452
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:28,950
- Yes.
- Yes.

453
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,719
- I can't ignore that.
- Right.

454
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,319
Don't you feel more attracted to Jae Keun?

455
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,320
Right.

456
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,829
That's because I got to see the real him.

457
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,159
He cried.

458
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,959
- He cried?
- He did.

459
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,960
Why?

460
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:45,900
He wants me to make a decision that will make me happy.

461
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,800
In a way, I...

462
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:53,710
I want you to be happy more than anyone.

463
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:55,380
So...

464
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:58,650
(In the end, Jae Keun cried.)

465
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:03,120
It felt like he truly cared about me.

466
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:07,990
At that moment, he took hold of my heart.

467
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,659
"Is he the kind of person I should be looking for?"

468
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:14,360
That crossed my mind for the first time at that moment.

469
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:18,470
I thought about the moment when I had smiled the happiest.

470
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,800
Then I realized that it was with Jae Keun.

471
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,800
Let's go home, Retriever Jae Keun.

472
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,670
Male Number Three, Hwang Jae Keun.

473
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:29,840
Please come up.

474
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,180
It's me.

475
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:33,879
(It's the most nerve-racking and heart-fluttering moment.)

476
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,320
- Go.
- Good luck.

477
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,920
- Good luck.
- Good luck, Jae Keun.

478
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,889
- Jae Keun.
- Good luck, Jae Keun.

479
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,350
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

480
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,860
- What?
- What about Sang Gyeong?

481
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,659
What happened to Sang Gyeong?

482
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,790
You didn't see that coming, right?

483
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,630
- I really didn't see that coming.
- Right. Totally.

484
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,599
Then what will happen to the dermatologist guy?

485
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,269
Right. Did she switch?

486
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,370
That's possible.

487
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,799
For people who don't know what happened,

488
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,600
- it's surprise after surprise.
- Right.

489
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,449
Don't they give off a similar vibe in terms of their appearance?

490
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,479
- You look good together.
- Yes.

491
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,050
(They finally stand facing each other.)

492
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:12,689
Out of all the times I've seen her, she looked...

493
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,120
she looked the most beautiful today.

494
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,160
She was glowing.

495
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,390
She was so beautiful that it almost made me tear up.

496
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,530
Male Number Three, Hwang Jae Keun,

497
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:29,970
will you propose to Female Number 23,

498
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,740
Seo Jin Ju?

499
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,679
I kept asking myself...

500
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,310
about the decision I deemed right.

501
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,619
I heard what happened.

502
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,790
(The guys had a conversation after the vote.)

503
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,450
- So it's about Jin Ju.
- Yes.

504
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:48,920
Jin Ju...

505
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,060
was only interested...

506
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,130
in Sang Gyeong from the start.

507
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,060
Why would he say that?

508
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,930
Then Jae Keun will start overanalyzing.

509
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,940
Did she use Jae Keun to figure out...

510
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,969
- how Sang Gyeong felt about her?
- So... No.

511
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:06,009
- That's not it.
- No.

512
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,540
- She's not the type.
- That's not it.

513
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,539
She couldn't pick between the two of you,

514
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,210
but Sang Gyeong had always been her number-one choice.

515
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,079
After hearing that,

516
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,819
- Jae Keun...
- Yes.

517
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,189
Must wonder if he was her backup option.

518
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,919
- Yes, of course.
- He must wonder about that.

519
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,159
- Of course. It's only natural.
- Come on.

520
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,160
- Yes.
- Yes.

521
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,060
I sort of expected it.

522
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,360
(When Sang Gyeong and Jae Keun were together...)

523
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,970
I still want to talk to him.

524
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,570
(Jin Ju pulled Sang Gyeong aside in front of Jae Keun.)

525
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,310
(Jae Keun was left all alone.)

526
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:43,040
To be honest, I thought Sang Gyeong was more suitable...

527
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,750
when it came to meeting her conditions for marriage.

528
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:50,619
(That night, Jae Keun went back to his room.)

529
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,549
Actually, there are things I must consider...

530
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,450
before making my decision.

531
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:57,390
- I see.
- There are. But Jin Ju...

532
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:01,430
She did say that she liked me.

533
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:04,000
You're my type.

534
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,169
I don't know. To be honest...

535
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:09,299
I'm attracted to you...

536
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,840
- because we're very compatible.
- Right.

537
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,770
But...

538
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:16,710
things will be tough in terms of our conditions.

539
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:20,610
Her hidden condition was to get married in 2025.

540
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,980
- I see.
- Okay.

541
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,050
(During the marriage-focused date)

542
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,890
- Right now, in two days - Right now?

543
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,989
In January after filming the show?

544
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,090
Something like that.

545
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,590
Among the options, would it be within 1 year?

546
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,159
Based on her conditions, I don't even qualify.

547
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,799
- I see.
- The fact that I don't qualify...

548
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,929
is quite embarrassing.

549
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:41,839
Considering what she wants, I can't fulfill so many of them.

550
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,400
- Yes.
- Okay.

551
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,409
Sang Gyeong might be the one who can meet her conditions.

552
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:49,110
- I see.
- That crossed my mind.

553
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:53,809
I didn't know Sang Gyeong's age in the beginning.

554
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:54,949
I thought he would be older than me.

555
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:58,120
- He also runs his own clinic.
- Right.

556
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,049
(Jae Keun felt a disparity in success between them...)

557
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:02,490
(due to the environment they were in.)

558
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,260
It made me wonder, "Will I be able..."

559
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:08,060
- "to give her what she wants?" - "Can I give her what she wants?"

560
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,630
- My gosh. This is such a pity.
- I...

561
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,699
So if I feel confident that I can make that happen,

562
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,940
I'll propose to her.

563
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,639
But if I don't think I can be responsible for her future,

564
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,140
I don't think I should propose.

565
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:26,080
(What kind of decision has he reached?)

566
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,550
You were dressed in black yesterday.

567
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,650
But today, you're dressed in white which makes you look more beautiful.

568
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,230
(The hall is filled with awed murmurs and gasps.)

569
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,900
(I'm not going to watch.)

570
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,500
You look stunning.

571
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,940
You always made me laugh whenever we spent time together.

572
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,349
You made me feel a sense of joy every moment we spent together.

573
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,180
For that, I would like to thank you again.

574
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,680
I was very happy.

575
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,520
- Things are looking great.
- What is this?

576
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:11,189
The two of them were very compatible...

577
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,789
- other than the conditions.
- Right.

578
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,030
Yes, other than the conditions.

579
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,960
Jin Ju.

580
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,370
I'm well aware that...

581
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:22,100
your commitment to this program...

582
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,170
is more serious than anyone else's.

583
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,410
For that,

584
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:33,009
I thought that I had to be more careful...

585
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:36,950
and make a decision with a sense of responsibility.

586
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:46,660
I...

587
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,829
will not propose to you.

588
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:56,270
(I will not propose to you.)

589
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,909
(Jae Keun chose not to propose to Jin Ju in the end.)

590
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,110
- My gosh.
- What?

591
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,210
Oh, no.

592
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,579
- Hold on.
- The mood just turned chilly.

593
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,980
(The result is unexpected and shocking.)

594
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,850
- Oh, no.
- My gosh.

595
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,090
- Poor Jin Ju.
- Gosh, Jin Ju.

596
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,630
I will not propose to you.

597
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:26,970
(Jae Keun chose not to pursue his feelings.)

598
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,070
I wonder what happened.

599
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:40,309
(His feelings for her weren't enough to overcome reality.)

600
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:43,020
Jae Keun has been through a lot to get this far.

601
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,720
But I never thought he'd give up here.

602
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:03,070
I thought you would be...

603
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:06,640
my sweet puppy.

604
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:15,779
I will support your decision too.

605
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,250
(I will support your decision too.)

606
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,920
Oh, my.

607
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,189
(They wished happiness for each other, )

608
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:30,529
(but they ended up going separate ways.)

609
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:33,700
(Jae Keun and Jin Ju's final proposal failed.)

610
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,200
It's really over.

611
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:45,509
If we were dating in our early or mid-20s,

612
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,910
it wouldn't have been this hard to make a decision.

613
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:54,050
If I was financially ready,

614
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:58,090
I could have given her a sense of certainty about our future.

615
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,260
Should I say that my feelings weren't enough...

616
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:04,430
to overcome the situation I was in?

617
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,930
That's how men feel. That's true.

618
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:10,439
He must have felt that he wasn't ready for marriage.

619
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,009
- Jae Keun didn't have a choice.
- Yeah.

620
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,910
He knew about Jin Ju's priorities.

621
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:18,340
My gosh, these conditions can be a bigger obstacle than I thought.

622
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,720
I was really going to commit to him.

623
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,720
I was really going to marry him.

624
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:46,540
I don't think anyone was more serious about this than me.

625
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:52,149
(She can't hide her sadness...)

626
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,310
(as she was committed more than anyone.)

627
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:59,849
I may have been too focused on getting married.

628
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:04,660
I might have given myself too much pressure about marriage.

629
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,699
I'll get married in 2025 or 2026 no matter what.

630
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,700
(Jin Ju wanted to get married more than anyone.)

631
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,470
(The first encounter between Jae Keun and Jin Ju)

632
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:17,740
(She was attracted to him from the first encounter.)

633
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,909
Hello, everyone.

634
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:22,180
(The two of them met again at the Palace Week.)

635
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:25,410
To me, you showed up out of the blue like a comet.

636
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,550
To me, you showed up out of the blue like a comet.

637
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,579
(They shared laughter...)

638
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:36,590
(and shed tears while expressing their genuine feelings.)

639
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,360
When you try so hard to catch something,

640
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:44,100
you can't. I think that's what happened.

641
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:46,499
Maybe, I should have loosened up...

642
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,099
and approached this without much pressure.

643
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,570
That's the regret I have.

644
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:55,679
- Jin Ju was serious about marriage.
- Yes.

645
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,679
And she tried really hard.

646
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,610
- That's so sad. What a pity.
- What a pity.

647
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:07,850
In my opinion, no one here wanted to get married as badly as I did.

648
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,160
But I couldn't.

649
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,500
(The morning of the final proposal)

650
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:20,500
(It's time to write a letter for their proposal partner.)

651
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:23,939
Ji Woong started to grow on me.

652
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,940
(Ji Woong writes the letter first.)

653
00:32:24,941 --> 00:32:26,970
Will he propose to Ha Yeon?

654
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:31,839
Ha Yeon wasn't calculative or tried to get the upper hand.

655
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,550
She's been proving herself to be trustworthy.

656
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:39,790
(She had always been there for him.)

657
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,249
Are you okay with the ten-year age gap?

658
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,490
Age doesn't matter.

659
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:46,129
(Ha Yeon had only eyes...)

660
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:49,660
(for Ji Woong.)

661
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,799
She could've been upset.

662
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,170
I told her I wanted to go to the single zone...

663
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,369
and make my decision after talking to other women.

664
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:57,939
Everything I told her...

665
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,309
could have hurt her feelings.

666
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:03,009
But despite my behavior, she had been consistent...

667
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:06,680
and showed me that she was willing to wait for me.

668
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:14,150
(She had always shown him unwavering consistency.)

669
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:19,030
(Even so, I'll only want you.)

670
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,889
I was grateful.

671
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:24,559
There were many times I wanted to apologize to her.

672
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,630
I realized that Ha Yeon was such a saint.

673
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:30,599
Ji Woong now knows Ha Yeon's genuine feelings now.

674
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,639
- Right.
- Yes.

675
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,270
There's no one like her.

676
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:35,679
My eyes welled up when I was writing the letter.

677
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,309
- Really?
- Yes.

678
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:39,579
I had been too mean to her, so I felt bad.

679
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,910
I felt sorry.

680
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,779
Ha Yeon is the kindest woman...

681
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:46,450
I met on the show.

682
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,790
Actually, this gave me a chance to realize just how much...

683
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,330
Ha Yeon meant to me.

684
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:58,100
Male Number 11, Kim Ji Woong,

685
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,730
will you propose to Female Number 26,

686
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:04,270
Kim Ha Yeon?

687
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:07,740
(Will he propose to her?)

688
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:10,480
Do it.

689
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,590
During Rounds 1 and 2, I behaved like a gentleman.

690
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:22,820
But contrary to what I led you to believe,

691
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,889
I teased you a lot at the Palace Week...

692
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:30,659
and behaved in a way that didn't give you...

693
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,960
a sense of certainty.

694
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,640
I'm very sorry about that.

695
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:41,170
Ha Yeon, you love food.

696
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,610
Let's not eat spicy, salty food like malatang.

697
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:46,509
I'll cook tasty home-cooked meals...

698
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,409
that feel like hugs for you.

699
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:51,320
(I'll cook for you.)

700
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,189
Shall we get married?

701
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:55,690
(Shall we get married?)

702
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:01,960
(He shows her the engagement ring with shaky hands.)

703
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,600
All right.

704
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:08,500
My gosh. Will she accept Ji Woong's proposal?

705
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:15,139
(But...)

706
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,010
She's hesitant, isn't she?

707
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:25,220
(Ha Yeon hesitates to give him an answer. Why is that?)

708
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,349
(Couple zone communal lounge)

709
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:29,519
Has anyone gone on a secret date?

710
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,620
(No one from the couple zone has gone on a secret date.)

711
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,790
I went on a secret date this morning.

712
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:35,729
- I did one with Sin Da.
- What?

713
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:37,560
Can she hear me? I hope not.

714
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,399
(She found out that he went on a date with Sin Da.)

715
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,530
- She heard it.
- What?

716
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,700
She found out.

717
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:47,610
- So what happened with your man?
- Aren't things peaceful over there?

718
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,879
I didn't know, but he went on a secret date.

719
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,409
Did you know? Only I didn't know.

720
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:54,449
- Do you know who requested it?
- There's more drama.

721
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,350
- I don't.
- Did she do it? Or was it him?

722
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,720
I was surprised after hearing that he had a secret date.

723
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:01,320
(Ha Yeon had a lot on her mind before the final proposal.)

724
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,590
He's bad.

725
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:04,289
- What?
- I sense bad energy from him.

726
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:06,590
I kept telling her that too.

727
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:08,159
It's not that he's a bad person.

728
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,560
- But he may not be a good partner.
- Right.

729
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,499
I see. People around her tried to stop her.

730
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,530
They did.

731
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:15,429
But Ji Woong told me to stay...

732
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:17,800
in Incheon for a few days before heading back.

733
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,909
He's being so sly.

734
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:19,910
- Right.
- He is?

735
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:23,110
(She couldn't dismiss the disapproval from the ladies.)

736
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:25,709
If I were younger, I would've jumped into the fire.

737
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:28,009
I don't even know what this is. Am I jumping into a fire?

738
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:29,149
You are.

739
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,150
- Yes.
- Really?

740
00:36:30,151 --> 00:36:31,350
(That gets 2 votes.)

741
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,450
(Everyone is worried about her relationship with him.)

742
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,149
(Ha Yeon has a lot on her mind before the final proposal.)

743
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:37,290
Yes, she must have a lot on her mind. Right?

744
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:43,230
Ji Woong always gets so close to crossing the line.

745
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:47,930
So that made me uncertain about marrying him.

746
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,740
Ji Woong.

747
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,810
Let's see. Will she accept his proposal?

748
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,680
She'll reject him.

749
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,220
Ji Woong.

750
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,690
I will...

751
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:10,519
accept your proposal.

752
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:16,800
(I will accept your proposal.)

753
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:18,759
(Contrary to their expectations, Ha Yeon accepts the proposal.)

754
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,829
- My gosh.
- My goodness.

755
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:23,669
Ha Yeon loves him so much.

756
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:26,140
She'll be wearing the rose-colored glasses for 20 years.

757
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:30,539
I would look like a fool if I said I liked him, right?

758
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,780
But I do like him. Yes.

759
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,549
(Their advice fell on deaf ears because...)

760
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,879
He's not like that when it's just the two of us.

761
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,420
So I thought he and I were a good match.

762
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:42,420
Do you like me now?

763
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,619
- Why?
- What? I'm just asking.

764
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,560
Do you think I'm that simple?

765
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:48,860
But I am.

766
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,330
- Were you like this as a kid?
- Yes.

767
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:54,700
I have a student like that in my class too.

768
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,839
(Even those mischievous ones...)

769
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,140
(can be thoughtful too.)

770
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,640
"Ha Yeon."

771
00:38:03,641 --> 00:38:06,749
"I think I made you feel insecure and uncomfortable."

772
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,509
"So I reflected on my behavior all night."

773
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:12,150
"Thank you for being patient and waiting only for me."

774
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:15,690
- They really might get married.
- Right.

775
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,460
They're holding hands.

776
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,560
"I..."

777
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:22,859
"like you."

778
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,030
(I like you.)

779
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:30,699
During the Palace Week,

780
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,199
we had a compatibility reading.

781
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:36,740
We were told it would be good for us to get married in May.

782
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,739
- Please.
- Seriously.

783
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,779
- At last.
- It'd be great if they got married.

784
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,380
- Right?
- Please.

785
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,320
(Meanwhile, a sigh echoes through the hall.)

786
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,050
(Who's letting out a deep sigh?)

787
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,819
(Male Number 26 Lee Jung Won)

788
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,660
Jung Won seems very nervous.

789
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,030
Dong Sung.

790
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:56,229
I think I'm dying.

791
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:58,430
I bet. Sin Da is scowling at you hard.

792
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:00,130
Sin Da is scowling at you hard.

793
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:03,500
Seriously. She's so scary.

794
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,010
Oh, my gosh.

795
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:09,080
- Where's Sin Da sitting?
- Where's Sin Da?

796
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:10,410
(Sin Da is seated across from him.)

797
00:39:10,411 --> 00:39:12,209
Why is she seated across from him of all places?

798
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:14,550
She's sitting in his line of sight.

799
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,849
You know what? I'm shocked.

800
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:19,590
- What is she doing there?
- Right. That's my point.

801
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,420
- I heard she was betrayed.
- Yes.

802
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:23,990
My gosh, this is fun.

803
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:28,990
Next. Male Number 26, Lee Jung Won.

804
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:31,130
Please come up.

805
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,700
Jung Won will finally begin his final proposal.

806
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:36,199
Good luck.

807
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,499
(Seung Yeon is also nervous.)

808
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,040
(And Sin Da is watching everything.)

809
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:42,410
Let's go.

810
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,849
Jung Won is so cool.

811
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:49,450
(He nervously stands on the wedding aisle.)

812
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,620
I can't imagine how nervous he must be.

813
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:57,060
(He seems to have a lot on his mind.)

814
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,389
I wonder who took Sin Da's place.

815
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:00,390
I'm curious.

816
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:05,060
Female Number 21, Oh Seung Yeon.

817
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:07,770
- What?
- Please step forward.

818
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:09,370
Seung Yeon?

819
00:40:09,371 --> 00:40:11,300
- Look!
- Everyone's surprised.

820
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,969
- Was there a connection?
- What?

821
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:14,909
Was there a connection between them? No, right?

822
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:17,640
He said that he couldn't decide at the last minute.

823
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:23,949
(After countless plot twists, )

824
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:27,720
(Jung Won and Seung Yeon surprised everyone.)

825
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:30,420
It felt like my heart would burst.

826
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,360
I was so nervous.

827
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,929
It was so nerve-racking.

828
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:39,530
It felt so strange for some reason.

829
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:46,440
(They confirmed each other's feelings.)

830
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:50,340
(They burned with passionate love.)

831
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,349
(It's time to find out...)

832
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,350
(their true feelings for the last time.)

833
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,749
It was short,

834
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:01,120
but there was a storm of emotions.

835
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,390
That's what gets you.

836
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:04,260
You meet for a short time,

837
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,189
and the feelings are even bigger.

838
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:08,590
(Their feelings weren't affected by the short time.)

839
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:11,900
Male Number 26, Lee Jung Won.

840
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:15,700
Will you propose...

841
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:19,270
to Female Number 21, Oh Seung Yeon?

842
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:26,680
It was less than a day,

843
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:29,180
but so many things happened.

844
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:37,760
On the first day of the Palace Week,

845
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:42,900
I don't think it was a mere coincidence that it snowed.

846
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:53,810
I threw a snowball at you that day.

847
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,380
You smiled so brightly,

848
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,780
and I loved your facial expressions.

849
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:02,250
I thought you were really pretty.

850
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:07,290
(They talked for the first time, )

851
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:11,460
(and they had lingering feelings for each other.)

852
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,730
(So, they asked each other on a secret date.)

853
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:15,130
Should we head back, then?

854
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:17,759
(It took a bit long, )

855
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,770
(but they found each other.)

856
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:26,710
(That's how they ended up on the wedding aisle.)

857
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:29,640
Just like the snowball I threw at you,

858
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:33,650
I throw myself at you.

859
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,410
Oh, my gosh.

860
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,320
Look at Sin Da's face.

861
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:42,490
Seung Yeon, will you marry me?

862
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,900
How can he be so shameless?

863
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,869
- Come on, Sin Da!
- Sin Da!

864
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:56,870
What was that about?

865
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,599
- Stop.
- No way.

866
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,740
- Sin Da, don't.
- Do it.

867
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,939
Sin Da isn't the type of girl to stay still, though.

868
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,010
Exactly.

869
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:11,950
I don't think...

870
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:16,090
we came all this far with a light heart.

871
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,890
Though our time was short,

872
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:22,630
I believed we were passionate.

873
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,800
I don't think they'll be a couple.

874
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:32,970
(How will their story end?)

875
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:36,240
I will marry you.

876
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:40,310
(Seung Yeon accepted Jung Won's proposal.)

877
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,220
They're getting married, for sure.

878
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,090
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

879
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,550
- Congratulations.
- It's so touching.

880
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:51,260
Congratulations.

881
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:54,489
Male Number 26, Lee Jung Won,

882
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:56,830
and Female Number 21, Oh Seung Yeon,

883
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,900
had a successful proposal.

884
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:02,839
(She answers with her bright smile that he loves.)

885
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,770
- Oh, my gosh!
- They make my heart flutter.

886
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:11,940
The moment he met me,

887
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:13,950
he never stopped giving me convictions.

888
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,050
(I threw the snowball because I wanted to talk to you.)

889
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:18,820
Stay here. I'll come back for you.

890
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,890
(The day before the final proposal...)

891
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:23,719
- Tomorrow, - Yes?

892
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,390
I'm the only one who needs to put in the work.

893
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:28,760
(He reassured her from beginning to end.)

894
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:32,130
Timing, variables, and everything...

895
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:33,469
seemed to be...

896
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:38,540
working for us while we were here.

897
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:43,809
I believed that we might be fate.

898
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:44,980
(We might actually be fate.)

899
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,580
When we go back to the real world,

900
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:49,880
we plan on eating lamb chops.

901
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,550
She said she liked lamb chops.

902
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,219
This is so dramatic.

903
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:01,660
(Jung Won and Seung Yeon had a successful final proposal.)

904
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:07,400
(The night before the final proposal)

905
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:09,739
- It's beautiful, isn't it?
- It's gorgeous.

906
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,469
(The two couples came outside to watch the Christmas tree.)

907
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:13,440
- Seriously. It's so good.
- Yes.

908
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:15,709
(Song Joon Ho, 29 years old, S Bio employee)

909
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:17,340
(Yun Ye Rim, 27 years old, marketer)

910
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:18,580
So pretty.

911
00:45:18,581 --> 00:45:19,909
(Go Yu Na, 27 years old, dermatologist from K University)

912
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:21,250
(Im Han Sae, 27 years old, engineer at S Electronics)

913
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:23,350
- Do you believe in Santa?
- I do.

914
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,719
What kind of gift do you want?

915
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,350
- Tell me first. What do you want?
- Me?

916
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:29,459
A wife.

917
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,990
(Joon Ho shyly tells her his wish.)

918
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:36,130
(Han Sae and Yu Na make a wish.)

919
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:39,230
What do you want for Christmas?

920
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,400
- Me?
- Yes.

921
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,400
I think I already got it.

922
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,700
Marry me.

923
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:49,270
Han Sae was so shy around strangers.

924
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:51,279
His ears didn't turn red today.

925
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,249
(Han Sae and Yu Na had a successful final proposal.)

926
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,410
They're adorable.

927
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:56,320
What a happy occasion.

928
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:58,149
(They say what's on their mind on the last night of Palace Week.)

929
00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:02,890
It's very meaningful that I get to wrap up the year with someone.

930
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:06,329
I was glad to be with Joon Ho.

931
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:08,490
I didn't say it like that! I'm in trouble.

932
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:13,469
I accept your proposal.

933
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:15,500
(This will be their beginning, not the end.)

934
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,200
He's so nervous.

935
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:20,239
They only had eyes for each other from start to finish.

936
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,369
- That's right.
- They even have similar smiles.

937
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:23,610
(Joon Ho and Ye Rim had a successful final proposal.)

938
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:25,810
Ja Hyun.

939
00:46:25,811 --> 00:46:26,879
(Min Dong Sung, 36 years old, entrepreneur of a beauty company)

940
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,010
(Kim Ja Hyun, 31 years old, CEO of a hair salon)

941
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:33,420
(Dong Sung can't seem to speak as he pictures all those moments.)

942
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:35,090
You can do it!

943
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:37,120
Oh, my gosh.

944
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:40,490
Is he crying? He must be getting emotional.

945
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:44,460
(Dong Sung chose the couple zone alone on the first day.)

946
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:47,430
(He returned to the single zone where Ja Hyun was.)

947
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:49,700
(He complained as he was upset.)

948
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:52,799
(But he never stopped choosing...)

949
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,939
(Ja Hyun.)

950
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,610
He's single-minded.

951
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:00,880
(He won over her heart by devoting himself to her.)

952
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:04,619
(They reassured each other...)

953
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:06,850
(and entered the couple zone.)

954
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:09,320
(The sweet guy even prepared a surprise for her.)

955
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,889
I got you a pretty gift.

956
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:13,390
It's cute.

957
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:16,600
(He constantly let her know how he felt.)

958
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,860
I was touched.

959
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:22,830
I accept your proposal.

960
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:24,170
All right!

961
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,339
Congrats!

962
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:28,040
(Dong Sung and Ja Hyun had a successful final proposal.)

963
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:31,110
Dong Sung is so romantic.

964
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:32,910
He's like a puppy.

965
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:36,580
(A nervous couple is on the wedding aisle.)

966
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,579
(Ahn Jae Kwan, 33 years old, CEO of a startup)

967
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:39,589
(Kim Jae Na, 36 years old, gayageum player)

968
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:43,760
I will not accept your proposal.

969
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,759
(The air turned cold in an instant.)

970
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,530
I did not feel...

971
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:56,740
(He hasn't devoted himself to her during the Palace Week.)

972
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,770
your genuineness or sincerity.

973
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:05,240
Sadly, Male Number 23, Ahn Jae Kwan,

974
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,310
and Female Number Four, Kim Jae Na,

975
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:09,720
did not succeed in the proposal.

976
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,650
The air turned cold instantly.

977
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,619
I also don't remember seeing the two together...

978
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:18,690
- that often.
- No.

979
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:21,329
(The two met in the bridal room after their failed proposals.)

980
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:23,000
- Did you cry?
- Yes.

981
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,100
You cried?

982
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,300
You were surprised, weren't you?

983
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:29,600
- I was just upset.
- I was so surprised.

984
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:34,310
(They turn gloomy as the proposals went wrong.)

985
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,140
I just...

986
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,410
I'm not sure.

987
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,609
But you were kind of expecting it.

988
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:42,850
I was.

989
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:45,979
To be realistic, I couldn't keep visiting Tokyo.

990
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:46,990
We're so silly.

991
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:52,659
The two who were the closest...

992
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:53,990
are here, looking miserable.

993
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:55,590
We're not miserable.

994
00:48:55,591 --> 00:48:57,199
- Why is it so funny...
- It's all right.

995
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,630
That we're sitting here after failing with our proposals?

996
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:03,570
- Are we the only ones who failed?
- Yes.

997
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,240
- They all succeeded?
- Yes.

998
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:07,970
You and I are the only ones so far.

999
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,079
- The two who were desperately...
- I'm sad all of a sudden.

1000
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,480
- looking for a spouse...
- Do you know why?

1001
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:13,810
We were too desperate.

1002
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:15,610
I'm so annoyed right now.

1003
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:16,750
I feel sad all of a sudden.

1004
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:22,189
- There are four men.
- Oh, my gosh.

1005
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:23,190
And two women.

1006
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:26,860
Male Number Four should go up.

1007
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,490
- I'm sure he will now.
- Yes.

1008
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:41,510
(The two have always been a solid couple.)

1009
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:49,210
(But there's been a misunderstanding.)

1010
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,180
You might have to consider...

1011
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:54,019
(He suggested that she leave since she was struggling.)

1012
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:56,720
leaving the show. What do you think?

1013
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,930
I do want to be alone.

1014
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:10,770
(Their fond feelings turned into disappointments.)

1015
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:13,970
Excuse me.

1016
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:20,279
(His excessive consideration worked against him.)

1017
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,380
I don't know how this happened.

1018
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:28,249
My feelings for her haven't changed, even the slightest.

1019
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:31,220
I wanted to talk to her candidly.

1020
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:35,929
I'll only feel better if I resolve the misunderstanding...

1021
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:37,399
before bed.

1022
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,200
(He wants to resolve the misunderstanding soon.)

1023
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:42,369
I believed...

1024
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:44,799
that overcoming your struggle at the time was a priority.

1025
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,270
That's why I said that to you.

1026
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:52,040
When you told me that I should leave,

1027
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,980
it felt like I had let go...

1028
00:50:55,450 --> 00:50:57,950
of something that I was holding on to.

1029
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:00,290
As if there was a blackout.

1030
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:07,160
I believe he said it for my sake.

1031
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:10,760
But it felt like I was lacking.

1032
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:15,030
I'll respect her decision entirely.

1033
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,700
Whatever the outcome may be.

1034
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,810
Male Number Four, Kim Hyun Joong.

1035
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,110
Female Number Ten, Lim Si Yeon.

1036
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:31,480
I don't think I'll regret my decision.

1037
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:36,460
They'll succeed for sure.

1038
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:43,460
(Will his genuine feelings reach her?)

1039
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:46,830
Let's find out.

1040
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:48,969
They were such a beautiful couple.

1041
00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:51,000
I'm rooting for them.

1042
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:55,040
Male Number Four, Kim Hyun Joong,

1043
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,510
will you propose...

1044
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:01,780
to Female Number Ten, Lim Si Yeon?

1045
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:06,990
All the conversations...

1046
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,820
we had during the Palace Week...

1047
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,090
and all types of experiences...

1048
00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:19,870
helped us get to know each other better.

1049
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:22,930
I wish to walk...

1050
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:26,239
on the flower path with you in the future as well.

1051
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,270
(I wish to walk on the flower path with you.)

1052
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:31,310
Accept it!

1053
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:34,180
Please accept...

1054
00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:37,020
my proposal, Si Yeon.

1055
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:40,920
What did he say?

1056
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:43,560
- He made a pun on her name.
- Yes.

1057
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:46,089
(Hyun Joong's cute proposal with a pun)

1058
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:47,629
- That's so cute!
- He had that up his sleeve.

1059
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:49,430
"Accept my proposal, Si Yeon."

1060
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:51,460
That's cute.

1061
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:59,300
(What will her answer be?)

1062
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:04,740
When I first saw you on December 7,

1063
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:09,750
I remember being so nervous and excited.

1064
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:18,460
I'll remember that day more.

1065
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:22,159
(Her answer sounds ambiguous.)

1066
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,499
- What does that mean?
- Wait.

1067
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,800
(Is she accepting it or turning it down?)

1068
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:32,900
(I do want to be alone.)

1069
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:36,609
You're making me upset by getting hurt.

1070
00:53:36,610 --> 00:53:37,640
You're being weird.

1071
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:39,610
Get on my back, my dear.

1072
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:41,880
(They shared many memories during the Palace Week.)

1073
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:45,880
(They were in their own world and only saw each other.)

1074
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:50,460
(His entire attention was on her.)

1075
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:52,860
(December 7, 2024, their first encounter)

1076
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:55,930
I had no idea he was so handsome.

1077
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:58,830
He's so good-looking.

1078
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:02,130
(When he first appeared...)

1079
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,870
(My pick is Number 10.)

1080
00:54:08,470 --> 00:54:12,179
He smiled brightly, saying, "I pick Number Ten,"

1081
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:13,750
and I'll never be able to forget his face.

1082
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:18,320
I'll remember that day more.

1083
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:24,360
I will...

1084
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:31,030
(How will their story end?)

1085
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,370
marry you.

1086
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,470
(She accepted his proposal.)

1087
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:40,240
Oh, my gosh!

1088
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,040
Goodness.

1089
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:49,180
He's so mature, thoughtful, and good-hearted,

1090
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:52,650
and I don't want to lose him.

1091
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,920
He's so thoughtful.

1092
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,390
I'm amazed by him and proud of him.

1093
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:01,290
I like him, and that's it.

1094
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,230
I like him.

1095
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:08,430
(He steps closer to Si Yeon...)

1096
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:12,070
Seriously. I knew this would happen. I'm so relieved.

1097
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:14,940
- I was so worried.
- Congratulations.

1098
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:16,539
They make a cute couple.

1099
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:17,809
(There's been a tiny misunderstanding, but...)

1100
00:55:17,810 --> 00:55:19,240
- They look good together.
- It's so sweet.

1101
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,480
You guys look gorgeous!

1102
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,680
- They make a great couple.
- They're beautiful.

1103
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:26,149
Hyun Joong and Si Yeon have become a couple now.

1104
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:28,020
(The guests congratulate them with a loud applause.)

1105
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:29,790
They're both good-looking.

1106
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,659
Since Round One,

1107
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:35,230
I've had a crush on him, I think.

1108
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:41,230
His mind is even better than his looks,

1109
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:46,270
and I'm impressed that I found a guy like him here.

1110
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:49,870
You look prettier up close.

1111
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:53,950
You look cool, even from afar.

1112
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:58,079
I have a feeling that they'll be happy for a long time.

1113
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,019
- Right.
- Yes, they're beautiful.

1114
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:01,320
(A good-looking couple has been made.)

1115
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,960
(Should we get married?)

1116
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:07,330
Your proposal was successful.

1117
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:11,329
(The proposals continue...)

1118
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:14,730
(while leaving some happy and some sad.)

1119
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,040
(And these four remain until the last moment.)

1120
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,610
(Joo Hee is the last bride in COUPLE PALACE.)

1121
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:25,110
(And three men await her decision.)

1122
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:27,550
(Male Number 7, Choi Jae Yeon)

1123
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:30,379
(Male Number 24, Lee Sang Gyeong)

1124
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:32,020
(Male Number 13, Kwon Young Taek)

1125
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:35,390
(Female Number 18, Bae Joo Hee)

1126
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:38,020
I'm extremely conflicted.

1127
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:40,789
She doesn't look so happy, right?

1128
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:42,690
A bride is supposed to look happy, though.

1129
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:45,960
I was exhausted,

1130
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:49,600
but I couldn't stop thinking.

1131
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:52,070
I contemplated all night.

1132
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:59,939
Female Number 18, Bae Joo Hee, please step forward.

1133
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:01,750
(It's finally Joo Hee's turn.)

1134
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:14,129
Once I make a decision,

1135
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:16,730
it will mean that I'm hurting the feelings of the other two.

1136
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:20,770
I had to take it seriously.

1137
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:29,870
(She stepped on the aisle after contemplation.)

1138
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:35,710
It's time to put an end to the chaos in her head.

1139
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:39,619
She must be so nervous.

1140
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:41,119
I bet she's so torn.

1141
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:43,149
Definitely. All three men are...

1142
00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:45,220
- so amazing and kind.
- Yes.

1143
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:48,030
Male Number 13,

1144
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:50,659
Kwon Young Taek.

1145
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:52,629
(Male Number 13, Kwon Young Taek)

1146
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:55,000
All right. Young Taek is going up first.

1147
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,970
Young Taek is a great guy.

1148
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:02,010
I'm hoping that a miracle of one percent would happen.

1149
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:08,480
Male Number Seven, Choi Jae Yeon.

1150
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:10,180
Finally, it's Jae Yeon's turn.

1151
00:58:12,850 --> 00:58:17,060
(But she can't seem to look at him.)

1152
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:20,260
Jae Yeon and I have had...

1153
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:23,860
mutual feelings since Round One.

1154
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:28,730
(Round 2, the ladies' speed train)

1155
00:58:28,930 --> 00:58:30,540
(He couldn't keep his eyes off her.)

1156
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:33,910
(I love "Pump It Up.")

1157
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:36,669
(They felt that they could be fated from the first encounter.)

1158
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:38,409
I love video games and anime.

1159
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:39,679
Seriously?

1160
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:40,680
No way!

1161
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:42,879
With Joo Hee,

1162
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,719
(From beginning to end, )

1163
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,579
from the speed train...

1164
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:49,019
(they've only looked at each other.)

1165
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:50,820
to the Palace Week...

1166
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,890
(Will you join me at Palace Week?)

1167
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,030
(They've been together the whole time.)

1168
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:59,030
I thought we really clicked.

1169
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:01,130
You're obviously genuine about it.

1170
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:03,639
I can only focus on one person.

1171
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,269
Do you have anyone other than Joo Hee?

1172
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:07,139
Not at all.

1173
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:10,069
It looked like she wanted to get to know others as well.

1174
00:59:10,070 --> 00:59:11,409
So, I'm waiting.

1175
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:14,149
Why are you always waiting? I feel bad for you.

1176
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:15,410
I'm sure she'll come back if I wait.

1177
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:18,420
How come he doesn't even waver once?

1178
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:20,249
I think...

1179
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:22,520
my feelings for you will only grow.

1180
00:59:22,890 --> 00:59:25,120
How are you so single-minded?

1181
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:29,929
I thought Jae Yeon and I would be together until the end.

1182
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:31,800
- Yes, they clicked so well.
- Yes.

1183
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:34,329
(But...)

1184
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:36,030
(there's been a change.)

1185
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,869
- Oh, no.
- Goodness.

1186
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:39,900
(A change occurred to her out of the blue.)

1187
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,340
Male Number 24,

1188
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:47,580
Lee Sang Gyeong.

1189
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:50,580
- Finally.
- He's going up there.

1190
00:59:54,690 --> 00:59:57,220
(Sang Gyeong calmly walks up to the wedding aisle.)

1191
00:59:58,690 --> 00:59:59,789
What will happen?

1192
00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:01,490
(How does she feel?)

1193
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:04,559
Some say you must pour the pork cutlet sauce on top,

1194
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:05,730
but then why fry it?

1195
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,469
What if we ordered tangsuyuk, and I poured the sauce on top?

1196
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:10,740
I'll dig into it fast.

1197
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:15,640
Simply looking at him is enough to make me laugh.

1198
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:19,010
My ideal type is someone funny.

1199
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:22,380
(Her feelings for Sang Gyeong naturally come out.)

1200
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:26,019
I had the biggest dilemma...

1201
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:29,520
about you, Number 24.

1202
01:00:30,490 --> 01:00:33,490
I believe there should be sincerity in well-spoken words.

1203
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:35,959
And I felt that sincerity.

1204
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,200
I...

1205
01:00:37,630 --> 01:00:39,330
want us to talk more.

1206
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:41,769
I had strong feelings for Joo Hee.

1207
01:00:41,770 --> 01:00:45,840
(Sang Gyeong didn't hesitate to express his feelings for Joo Hee.)

1208
01:00:46,570 --> 01:00:48,310
(See you tomorrow.)

1209
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:50,410
But...

1210
01:00:51,210 --> 01:00:53,480
an unexpected situation happened.

1211
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,280
(He thought they felt the same.)

1212
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:58,980
(She chose Jae Yeon over him.)

1213
01:00:59,050 --> 01:01:00,990
- Did you decide on Jae Yeon?
- Yes.

1214
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:02,689
That takes up the biggest reason.

1215
01:01:02,690 --> 01:01:04,260
- I have...
- Yes?

1216
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:06,959
A story with Jae Yeon from the beginning.

1217
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:10,060
That's the biggest reason.

1218
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:12,230
(Sang Gyeong couldn't get assurance from Joo Hee.)

1219
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:16,600
Joo Hee said she'd choose Jae Yeon.

1220
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:18,570
I don't know.

1221
01:01:22,770 --> 01:01:27,750
(In the end, the four face each other.)

1222
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:32,180
(Joo Hee has to make a decision.)

1223
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:34,650
(And three men are waiting for her decision.)

1224
01:01:34,990 --> 01:01:37,490
(Who will Joo Hee choose?)

1225
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,559
(Attraction, )

1226
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:43,330
(trust, )

1227
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:45,260
(and excitement)

1228
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:48,500
(Overcoming the whirlpool of emotions, )

1229
01:01:48,730 --> 01:01:50,970
(it's time Joo Hee chooses.)

1230
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:53,499
- Gosh, I'm nervous.
- I can't even make a guess.

1231
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:54,510
(An unpredictable result)

1232
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:56,710
- What do you think will happen?
- I have no clue.

1233
01:01:56,740 --> 01:01:59,280
I have no idea how she feels.

1234
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:02,310
If it's not Joo Hee, Number Seven is going home.

1235
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:06,550
Female Number 18, Bae Joo Hee.

1236
01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:10,390
Please choose your final partner.

1237
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:13,659
When Joo Hee came out,

1238
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:16,430
I was confident she would choose me, but...

1239
01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:23,000
(Joo Hee is deep in thought.)

1240
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:27,670
(The morning of the final proposal)

1241
01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:32,010
What memories did Sang Gyeong write about in his letter?

1242
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:34,809
It's all about my feelings.

1243
01:02:34,810 --> 01:02:37,280
I wrote as my heart told me to.

1244
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:40,989
I think it'll help...

1245
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:43,150
remind her of our happy memories together.

1246
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:49,860
(Joo Hee reads the letter from Sang Gyeong.)

1247
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:53,730
I was extremely prejudiced against Sang Gyeong,

1248
01:02:53,830 --> 01:02:56,330
but he broke every one of them.

1249
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:00,469
I thought it'd be great to go to the couple zone...

1250
01:03:00,470 --> 01:03:03,210
if we were on the same page after talking more.

1251
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:06,839
Based on his looks, I thought he'd be a certain way.

1252
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,109
But he wasn't.

1253
01:03:08,110 --> 01:03:10,210
He's serious about marriage more than anyone else.

1254
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,379
I want to hear that she likes me.

1255
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:14,390
After all, we're supposed to have a relationship.

1256
01:03:14,850 --> 01:03:16,090
That's why I like you.

1257
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:18,659
It was nice.

1258
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:22,830
I was able to see his earnestness more.

1259
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,600
(Laying Sang Gyeong's letter to heart, )

1260
01:03:29,530 --> 01:03:32,600
(she reads Jae Yeon's letter next.)

1261
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:36,310
- What? Something must be inside.
- Something...

1262
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:38,110
What is it?

1263
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:42,110
(Joo Hee's dilemma has gotten worse.)

1264
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:43,979
Have another piece of meat.

1265
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:46,020
- I don't want to chew on anything.
- No?

1266
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:48,550
(Joo Hee had an upset stomach throughout Palace Week.)

1267
01:03:49,350 --> 01:03:51,960
(And Jae Yeon kept observing Joo Hee.)

1268
01:03:55,190 --> 01:03:57,259
Joo Hee kept saying she had heartburn.

1269
01:03:57,260 --> 01:03:59,830
I wanted to do something for her.

1270
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:04,070
I put a digestive medicine inside.

1271
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:07,939
He gave her a digestive medicine.

1272
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:09,539
Jae Yeon.

1273
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:12,980
(Jae Yeon worried about Joo Hee until the very end.)

1274
01:04:14,010 --> 01:04:18,950
(Joo Hee is filled with thoughts at Jae Yeon's sincerity.)

1275
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:23,350
Won't she feel a bit relieved after seeing that digestive medicine?

1276
01:04:32,930 --> 01:04:36,400
(Joo Hee couldn't stop crying for a while.)

1277
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:43,570
I received too much.

1278
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:50,150
I'm terribly sorry for wavering...

1279
01:04:50,450 --> 01:04:52,080
despite telling you...

1280
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:54,050
it'll only be you.

1281
01:04:56,050 --> 01:04:57,660
And I'm sorry...

1282
01:04:57,860 --> 01:05:00,760
to make you wait and more.

1283
01:05:02,590 --> 01:05:04,159
(Among the three men, )

1284
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:07,030
(whose sincerity reached Joo Hee?)

1285
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:12,140
The final partner I choose...

1286
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:16,610
(Male Number 13, Kwon Young Taek)

1287
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:20,110
(Male Number 24, Lee Sang Gyeong)

1288
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:23,210
(Male Number 7, Choi Jae Yeon)

1289
01:05:23,510 --> 01:05:25,780
(Who will Joo Hee choose?)

1290
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:29,950
is Male...

1291
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:35,230
The final partner I choose...

1292
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:40,670
(The three men are waiting for their names to be called.)

1293
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:43,370
(Male Number 13, Kwon Young Taek)

1294
01:05:43,530 --> 01:05:46,840
(Male Number 24, Lee Sang Gyeong)

1295
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,070
(Male Number 7, Choi Jae Yeon)

1296
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:53,480
(Who will Joo Hee choose?)

1297
01:05:56,210 --> 01:06:01,119
(The man who made me laugh every second)

1298
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:02,519
I don't want to go back.

1299
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:03,990
- Right?
- Yes.

1300
01:06:04,290 --> 01:06:06,290
- A date outside is really fun.
- Exactly.

1301
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:08,659
Look over there.

1302
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:13,060
(The man who waited for me every second)

1303
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:17,840
I want to return the feelings he has given me.

1304
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:23,240
(The one person Joo Hee will convey her feelings to is...)

1305
01:06:25,010 --> 01:06:28,980
I choose Male Number 24, Sang Gyeong.

1306
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:34,850
(Joo Hee's final choice is Sang Gyeong.)

1307
01:06:35,350 --> 01:06:38,020
A man who I get along with really well appeared.

1308
01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:42,260
I choose Male Number 24, Sang Gyeong.

1309
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:47,030
I feel terrible for making such a decision.

1310
01:06:49,530 --> 01:06:52,939
(Nobody expected her to make such a choice.)

1311
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:54,209
It changed. I'm losing it.

1312
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:56,609
- Male Number 24, Lee Sang Gyeong, - I'm so shocked.

1313
01:06:56,610 --> 01:06:58,640
- I really am.
- will you...

1314
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:04,750
(A twist, leaving everyone in shock.)

1315
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:06,519
What a twist.

1316
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:08,749
She couldn't choose out of guilt.

1317
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:10,550
- No. That's wrong.
- Right?

1318
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:14,860
(To everyone's surprise, Joo Hee chose Sang Gyeong.)

1319
01:07:15,830 --> 01:07:18,199
(In the end, Jae Yeon's feelings couldn't reach Joo Hee.)

1320
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:19,459
Jae Yeon's face is...

1321
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:21,100
I feel bad for Jae Yeon.

1322
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:25,569
Sang Gyeong also has...

1323
01:07:25,570 --> 01:07:27,610
a complicated look on his face.

1324
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:33,080
(Walking past by Jae Yeon, )

1325
01:07:33,610 --> 01:07:35,680
(Sang Gyeong stands before Joo Hee.)

1326
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:42,390
(The two finally stand face to face.)

1327
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:44,519
Sang Gyeong must be...

1328
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:47,790
(The dice of fate has been cast.)

1329
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:54,630
Male Number 24, Lee Sang Gyeong,

1330
01:07:54,830 --> 01:07:57,769
will you propose...

1331
01:07:57,770 --> 01:08:00,070
to Female Number 18, Bae Joo Hee?

1332
01:08:02,770 --> 01:08:05,339
Joo Hee told me I was handsome...

1333
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:06,479
and expressed her feelings.

1334
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:09,109
Mustering up such courage isn't easy.

1335
01:08:09,110 --> 01:08:11,250
I think highly of it.

1336
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:15,250
But...

1337
01:08:17,790 --> 01:08:19,360
I want...

1338
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:22,160
to ask you to give up.

1339
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:24,360
My feelings are sincere.

1340
01:08:28,670 --> 01:08:32,870
(We trusted and relied on each other.)

1341
01:08:34,370 --> 01:08:35,570
I'm getting anxious.

1342
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:38,609
Jae Yeon was crying so much back then...

1343
01:08:38,610 --> 01:08:40,410
and that made me tear up.

1344
01:08:42,950 --> 01:08:44,320
I don't want...

1345
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:47,180
to hurt Jae Yeon's feelings.

1346
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:51,520
Nor do I want to hurt Joo Hee.

1347
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:56,029
(Sang Gyeong wants to make a decision that won't hurt anyone.)

1348
01:08:56,030 --> 01:08:58,300
What now?

1349
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:01,300
He must feel so burdened.

1350
01:09:02,170 --> 01:09:03,200
Maybe he'll give up.

1351
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:05,340
I bet he will.

1352
01:09:06,570 --> 01:09:07,570
- What will he do?
- You think he will propose?

1353
01:09:07,571 --> 01:09:08,939
- Why do I feel like he won't?
- Gosh.

1354
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:09,940
- Really?
- He won't?

1355
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:12,880
(What will Sang Gyeong do?)

1356
01:09:13,910 --> 01:09:17,380
We had such a rough time...

1357
01:09:18,650 --> 01:09:20,050
and had a lot to think about.

1358
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:26,390
(Sang Gyeong is at the crossroads of love and friendship.)

1359
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:28,530
(Will he propose to her?)

1360
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:37,370
(What will Sang Gyeong do?)

1361
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:41,040
We had such a rough time...

1362
01:09:42,410 --> 01:09:43,870
and had a lot to think about.

1363
01:09:45,210 --> 01:09:46,210
Even so,

1364
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:48,880
we laughed so much.

1365
01:09:51,150 --> 01:09:52,650
We had such a fun time.

1366
01:09:54,950 --> 01:09:56,390
We were very happy.

1367
01:10:01,930 --> 01:10:05,500
(The friendship that he opened himself up to...)

1368
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:09,370
(And the love that made him laugh...)

1369
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:15,540
(He can't delay the decision any longer.)

1370
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:25,380
(What will happen to them?)

1371
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:28,850
(Joo Hee suddenly smiles brightly.)

1372
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,690
(Sang Gyeong offers the ring with a shaky hand.)

1373
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:37,229
Are you ready to laugh forever with me?

1374
01:10:37,230 --> 01:10:42,570
(Are you ready to laugh forever with me?)

1375
01:10:43,470 --> 01:10:45,799
(Sang Gyeong gets it off his chest and proposes to Joo Hee.)

1376
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:47,470
- He took the load off.
- Right?

1377
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:50,510
If I were to give up,

1378
01:10:50,610 --> 01:10:53,710
Joo Hee, who had expectations, would get hurt.

1379
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:57,550
It would also make Jae Yeon more miserable.

1380
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:02,590
When we had our first conversation,

1381
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:07,790
that 10-minute conversation made me laugh for a week.

1382
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:13,630
I accept your proposal.

1383
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:16,599
(Sang Gyeong finally smiles brightly.)

1384
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:17,640
Congratulations.

1385
01:11:18,670 --> 01:11:20,000
The two look good together.

1386
01:11:20,570 --> 01:11:23,740
- How lovely.
- I know, right?

1387
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:26,680
Male Number 24, Lee Sang Gyeong,

1388
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:29,110
and Female Number 18, Bae Joo Hee,

1389
01:11:29,810 --> 01:11:31,520
had a successful proposal.

1390
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:34,590
Congratulations!

1391
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:36,190
Have a happy life!

1392
01:11:37,390 --> 01:11:40,290
(Sang Gyeong and Joo Hee had a successful final proposal.)

1393
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:43,790
Do you have a picture of your future?

1394
01:11:43,890 --> 01:11:45,429
My life goal is...

1395
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:48,929
to get married early and form a happy family.

1396
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:50,469
If the person I like...

1397
01:11:50,470 --> 01:11:52,169
has the same sense of humor as me,

1398
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:53,869
life will be fun...

1399
01:11:53,870 --> 01:11:55,810
even without doing anything special.

1400
01:11:56,010 --> 01:11:57,110
But honestly,

1401
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:00,210
we laugh without putting much effort in.

1402
01:12:00,510 --> 01:12:03,109
- That's an important factor to me.
- Me too.

1403
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:04,780
I feel really happy right now.

1404
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:11,090
A man I enjoy talking to without realizing time is flying.

1405
01:12:11,190 --> 01:12:14,660
That's my top marriage condition.

1406
01:12:15,830 --> 01:12:16,989
I chose him,

1407
01:12:16,990 --> 01:12:19,800
and he chose me, which makes me very happy.

1408
01:12:20,930 --> 01:12:21,930
This is what I like.

1409
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:25,300
She expresses her happiness.

1410
01:12:26,970 --> 01:12:29,569
Isn't he hilarious?

1411
01:12:29,570 --> 01:12:32,209
(The two show off the same sense of humor.)

1412
01:12:32,210 --> 01:12:33,740
He's so funny.

1413
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:35,849
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

1414
01:12:35,850 --> 01:12:37,350
- Really.
- Congratulations.

1415
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,019
- To think we'd get this picture.
- Gosh.

1416
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:42,949
Sang Gyeong went for it without being too self-conscious.

1417
01:12:42,950 --> 01:12:45,289
Those two look genuinely happy.

1418
01:12:45,290 --> 01:12:48,059
I understand how they must feel.

1419
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:49,130
(We root for the two until the end.)

1420
01:12:49,190 --> 01:12:51,430
(Their stories have yet to end.)

1421
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:54,570
To me, COUPLE PALACE is...

1422
01:12:54,930 --> 01:12:58,240
a once-in-a-lifetime important chance.

1423
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:00,569
It closed a large part...

1424
01:13:00,570 --> 01:13:03,169
of the gap I had about marriage.

1425
01:13:03,170 --> 01:13:05,640
Everything is possible if sincerity goes through to the other.

1426
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:08,380
You should get married too.

1427
01:13:09,910 --> 01:13:11,650
Love is all about timing.

1428
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:13,950
It's like I already got married today.

1429
01:13:14,180 --> 01:13:16,120
I'm excited about the future.

1430
01:13:16,950 --> 01:13:18,690
I have a lot I want to do together.

1431
01:13:18,790 --> 01:13:21,159
Checking off this list will take years.

1432
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:22,160
I'm getting excited.

1433
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:27,160
I'll try to bring good news with Ji Woong.

1434
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:31,740
Had I not come on the show again, I wouldn't have met Kyung Seok.

1435
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:35,140
I'm proud of myself for finding my healthy and pretty self.

1436
01:13:35,710 --> 01:13:37,440
We'll live a happy life.

1437
01:13:39,110 --> 01:13:41,450
As I thought, marriage isn't easy.

1438
01:13:41,980 --> 01:13:43,980
I thought about the realistic things.

1439
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:46,780
This must be why I can't get married.

1440
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:50,149
I'm wrapping up with regrets.

1441
01:13:50,150 --> 01:13:51,389
Come here. Great work.

1442
01:13:51,390 --> 01:13:54,290
I can't help but think there was the most sincerity.

1443
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:57,760
COUPLE PALACE has finally come to an end.

1444
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,059
A total of nine couples...

1445
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:01,729
- have successfully proposed.
- Unbelievable.

1446
01:14:01,730 --> 01:14:02,969
(Nine couples have successfully proposed.)

1447
01:14:02,970 --> 01:14:04,539
Sixty single men and women...

1448
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:07,199
came this far with marriage as their single goal.

1449
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:09,369
Exactly. It's a show that encourages marriage.

1450
01:14:09,370 --> 01:14:10,370
- Yes.
- Totally.

1451
01:14:10,371 --> 01:14:11,380
They look good together.

1452
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:12,810
Have a happy life.

1453
01:14:13,540 --> 01:14:15,210
I recommend COUPLE PALACE.

1454
01:14:15,310 --> 01:14:18,080
You can fall in love for real.

1455
01:14:20,150 --> 01:14:21,150
I'm jealous.

1456
01:14:21,151 --> 01:14:23,719
COUPLE PALACE roots for your marriage.

1457
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:24,759
- We do.
- Yes.

1458
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:27,460
(We root for your successful marriage.)
