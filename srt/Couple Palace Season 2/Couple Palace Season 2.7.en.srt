1
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:16,252
Never let your guard down on COUPLE PALACE.

2
00:00:16,253 --> 00:00:18,692
- It's huge these days. - It's huge.

3
00:00:18,693 --> 00:00:21,892
- A lot of people are so into this. - Right.

4
00:00:21,893 --> 00:00:24,692
One person who's like that is Cha Tae Hyun.

5
00:00:24,693 --> 00:00:27,563
- He always messages me. - Really?

6
00:00:27,763 --> 00:00:29,633
He's like, "Why are they doing that?"

7
00:00:29,903 --> 00:00:31,303
(He can't help but ask.)

8
00:00:31,403 --> 00:00:33,732
Any couple you were curious about?

9
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,873
Jae Keun and Jin Ju.

10
00:00:36,073 --> 00:00:37,102
(Three women are tangled up with Jae Keun.)

11
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:38,673
And Hye Won.

12
00:00:39,013 --> 00:00:40,843
Jae Keun is really popular.

13
00:00:40,983 --> 00:00:43,412
I can't wait to find out...

14
00:00:43,413 --> 00:00:44,812
how it will be resolved.

15
00:00:44,813 --> 00:00:46,783
I'm curious about Sin Da and Jung Won.

16
00:00:47,253 --> 00:00:48,882
I don't know what happened to them.

17
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:50,622
They suddenly moved to the couple zone.

18
00:00:50,623 --> 00:00:52,092
(Sin Da and Jung Won suddenly moved to the couple zone.)

19
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,222
And Ji Woong just happened to...

20
00:00:53,223 --> 00:00:55,493
sit next to her.

21
00:00:55,863 --> 00:00:58,763
I wonder if she'll be swayed or become firmer.

22
00:00:58,863 --> 00:01:01,603
That will be something to watch.

23
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:03,632
I'm curious about...

24
00:01:03,633 --> 00:01:05,073
how they decided to get up to the couple zone.

25
00:01:05,773 --> 00:01:09,173
(Day-2, couple zone)

26
00:01:10,273 --> 00:01:11,942
- What's this? - What?

27
00:01:11,943 --> 00:01:13,242
(The couples are surprised by something.)

28
00:01:13,243 --> 00:01:14,512
Why are you surprised?

29
00:01:14,513 --> 00:01:15,612
Marriage exam?

30
00:01:15,613 --> 00:01:16,942
(There's a marriage exam in the couple zone)

31
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:18,613
- What exam? - Marriage exam.

32
00:01:20,053 --> 00:01:21,522
That marriage exam is important...

33
00:01:21,523 --> 00:01:23,652
because they can check each other's values through this.

34
00:01:23,653 --> 00:01:24,923
- That's right. - It's the best.

35
00:01:25,153 --> 00:01:26,492
Marriage exam.

36
00:01:26,493 --> 00:01:27,493
It's cute.

37
00:01:27,494 --> 00:01:29,763
(The couples start taking their marriage exam!)

38
00:01:30,363 --> 00:01:31,363
This is hard.

39
00:01:31,364 --> 00:01:32,792
(Would you let your spouse go out to meet their friend at 2am?)

40
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:34,402
Of course not.

41
00:01:34,403 --> 00:01:35,702
At 2am in the morning?

42
00:01:35,703 --> 00:01:37,532
Not even your mom would let you go out at 2am.

43
00:01:37,533 --> 00:01:38,533
(A. I won't let them go. B. I'll go out with them.)

44
00:01:38,534 --> 00:01:40,233
One, two, three.

45
00:01:40,373 --> 00:01:41,843
- A. - A.

46
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:44,202
- We matched. - But I don't like...

47
00:01:44,203 --> 00:01:45,672
any of these answers.

48
00:01:45,673 --> 00:01:47,473
I'd just let him go.

49
00:01:47,913 --> 00:01:49,383
- You'd let him go? - Yes.

50
00:01:49,713 --> 00:01:51,813
Wouldn't you feel offended if I stopped you from going out?

51
00:01:52,053 --> 00:01:55,053
- Letting you go out... - Can I ask you an extreme question?

52
00:01:55,353 --> 00:01:56,353
Don't do it.

53
00:01:56,354 --> 00:01:58,922
- At 2am, - A woman? A female friend?

54
00:01:58,923 --> 00:02:03,463
what if your spouse wants to go out to see Sin Da?

55
00:02:03,663 --> 00:02:04,832
What's wrong with him?

56
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,062
- Why would he bring her up? - Why all of a sudden?

57
00:02:07,063 --> 00:02:09,233
That's such a strange example.

58
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:11,273
What if your spouse wants to go out to see Sin Da?

59
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,802
- That's... - Would you go with him?

60
00:02:13,803 --> 00:02:15,872
- That's a bit... - A, you'd let him go out.

61
00:02:15,873 --> 00:02:16,973
B, you'd go with him.

62
00:02:17,073 --> 00:02:19,672
I'd feel uncomfortable, but I trust him.

63
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:21,013
That's why I'd let him go alone.

64
00:02:21,383 --> 00:02:23,783
Okay, it means that I have one chance.

65
00:02:23,883 --> 00:02:24,913
I got it.

66
00:02:25,213 --> 00:02:26,653
- I'm kidding. - She got serious.

67
00:02:26,753 --> 00:02:28,483
Yes, that's understandable.

68
00:02:30,023 --> 00:02:31,923
I haven't said that I'd marry you yet.

69
00:02:32,493 --> 00:02:34,292
- What? - No, she hasn't.

70
00:02:34,293 --> 00:02:36,223
That was a good comeback.

71
00:02:36,463 --> 00:02:37,733
Good job.

72
00:02:39,163 --> 00:02:40,192
(I'd let my spouse know if I won the lottery.)

73
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:43,763
"I'd let my spouse know if I won the lottery. Yes or no."

74
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:45,402
- One, two, three. - Two, three.

75
00:02:45,403 --> 00:02:46,403
- Yes. - Yes.

76
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:49,343
"The parents of your spouse will buy a house for you...

77
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:52,312
but only if you give them the passcode to the door."

78
00:02:52,313 --> 00:02:53,842
- One, two, three. No. - One, two, three. No.

79
00:02:53,843 --> 00:02:55,183
(They both say no.)

80
00:02:55,283 --> 00:02:57,383
- I wouldn't accept the house. - Me neither.

81
00:02:58,183 --> 00:03:00,753
"The parents of your spouse will buy a house for you...

82
00:03:00,853 --> 00:03:02,353
but only if you give them the passcode to the door."

83
00:03:02,453 --> 00:03:03,882
I'd be very grateful.

84
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:05,152
- I'd be okay with that. - I'd thank them.

85
00:03:05,153 --> 00:03:06,153
Isn't that a given?

86
00:03:06,154 --> 00:03:08,163
They bought the house for us, so I should let them know.

87
00:03:08,263 --> 00:03:10,493
There's nothing to worry about Yeong Seok and Soo Min.

88
00:03:10,593 --> 00:03:11,832
They're so therapeutic.

89
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:12,863
That's right.

90
00:03:13,163 --> 00:03:15,333
- Let him know my phone passcode? - I don't think so.

91
00:03:15,433 --> 00:03:16,433
Me neither.

92
00:03:16,503 --> 00:03:18,433
- They both agree on everything. - Right.

93
00:03:18,973 --> 00:03:22,273
Among all the people on COUPLE PALACE,

94
00:03:22,543 --> 00:03:24,413
I think you're the most compatible for me.

95
00:03:25,473 --> 00:03:27,043
- Regardless of gender. - Yes.

96
00:03:27,683 --> 00:03:29,343
I was looking for...

97
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:33,282
the male version of me to marry.

98
00:03:33,283 --> 00:03:34,823
That's exactly who he is.

99
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,583
You're cute.

100
00:03:37,023 --> 00:03:38,723
- Am I cute? - Yes.

101
00:03:39,293 --> 00:03:40,723
I like holding hands.

102
00:03:41,193 --> 00:03:42,263
I like it too.

103
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:43,863
I'm so jealous.

104
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:49,433
You're the most beautiful.

105
00:03:50,633 --> 00:03:52,132
(Yeong Seok expresses himself to Soo Min without hindrance.)

106
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:54,202
- Gosh. - "You're the most beautiful?"

107
00:03:54,203 --> 00:03:56,943
My goodness. I want to hear that every day.

108
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:59,543
He took care of me a lot.

109
00:03:59,643 --> 00:04:03,713
Everyone told me how he looked at me in adoration.

110
00:04:03,983 --> 00:04:06,153
There's adoration in Yeong Seok's eyes.

111
00:04:07,153 --> 00:04:10,583
- It's so therapeutic to watch them. - Right.

112
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:12,623
- There's no conflict at all. - It's nice.

113
00:04:12,723 --> 00:04:14,123
It's very nice.

114
00:04:14,863 --> 00:04:17,593
(Day-2, single zone)

115
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:19,763
Ye Rin.

116
00:04:19,963 --> 00:04:22,233
Many people are rooting for Ye Rin.

117
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:26,203
What do you think of the model from Canada?

118
00:04:26,303 --> 00:04:27,873
I like him. He's nice.

119
00:04:28,773 --> 00:04:31,213
(During Round 3, speed date)

120
00:04:31,673 --> 00:04:33,012
You have a beautiful voice.

121
00:04:33,013 --> 00:04:34,643
(Kyung Seok and Ye Rin went on a date.)

122
00:04:35,143 --> 00:04:37,753
(After making a connection, they came to Palace Week together.)

123
00:04:37,913 --> 00:04:39,183
Go and talk to him.

124
00:04:40,953 --> 00:04:44,493
I'm bad at expressing myself in the beginning stages.

125
00:04:45,293 --> 00:04:47,863
It was still hard for me at Palace Week.

126
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:52,233
In the single zone... I mean, in the couple zone,

127
00:04:52,763 --> 00:04:53,763
people hold hands.

128
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,033
- I want to hold hands too. - Really?

129
00:04:56,133 --> 00:04:57,502
- Try this. - It's the first time.

130
00:04:57,503 --> 00:04:58,973
"Can we compare our hand sizes?"

131
00:04:59,203 --> 00:05:00,203
Then put your hands together.

132
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,003
As soon as you do, hold his hand.

133
00:05:04,073 --> 00:05:06,672
Why are you getting excited when it's just me?

134
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:09,512
- This is annoying. - This is very...

135
00:05:09,513 --> 00:05:10,513
You should learn.

136
00:05:10,514 --> 00:05:11,553
Can I really do that?

137
00:05:11,753 --> 00:05:14,523
Of course. What's the problem? It isn't illegal.

138
00:05:15,623 --> 00:05:16,623
That's cute.

139
00:05:16,624 --> 00:05:19,622
They look like high school students on a school trip.

140
00:05:19,623 --> 00:05:22,023
Right. They're very shy when they talk.

141
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,893
Give me some more helpful advice.

142
00:05:24,993 --> 00:05:28,063
First of all, you act like you're always at work.

143
00:05:28,163 --> 00:05:31,132
You talk like you're explaining something to a client.

144
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:32,203
- I do? - Yes.

145
00:05:32,303 --> 00:05:33,332
- Really? - Yes.

146
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,403
Don't just sit there but try crossing your legs.

147
00:05:35,873 --> 00:05:38,273
- Twist your body like this. - This is so interesting.

148
00:05:38,373 --> 00:05:39,373
Twist?

149
00:05:39,374 --> 00:05:41,782
Try to touch him with your foot.

150
00:05:41,783 --> 00:05:43,682
- Goodness. - Or your shoulder.

151
00:05:43,683 --> 00:05:45,813
(100 percent focused)

152
00:05:45,853 --> 00:05:47,352
- Twist. - Twist.

153
00:05:47,353 --> 00:05:49,483
Cross your legs. Get close to him.

154
00:05:50,223 --> 00:05:52,193
I'll try it all tomorrow.

155
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:56,293
I've never flirted with anyone before.

156
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:59,763
I want to be more proactive this time.

157
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:04,432
Ye Rin is only thinking about how to flirt.

158
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:05,903
Cross your legs. Twist.

159
00:06:06,403 --> 00:06:08,703
(Kyung Seok and Ye Rin came upstairs for a private chat.)

160
00:06:08,943 --> 00:06:10,803
- Oh, wow. - I don't want to go home.

161
00:06:11,043 --> 00:06:12,142
When I go home...

162
00:06:12,143 --> 00:06:15,583
Ye Rin keeps waiting for the right time to flirt.

163
00:06:15,683 --> 00:06:17,743
Ye Rin, it's right now.

164
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:21,152
It could be tiring,

165
00:06:21,153 --> 00:06:23,123
so let's drink some caffeine.

166
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,453
I appreciate it. Thank you so much.

167
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:28,862
Do you have inner-fold double eyelids?

168
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,062
- Yes. - I like inner-fold double eyelids.

169
00:06:31,063 --> 00:06:33,593
- Really? - When you look at someone,

170
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:35,333
- you often look at their eyes. - Right.

171
00:06:35,703 --> 00:06:36,962
She's getting closer to him.

172
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:39,073
- We don't look at their hands. - Right.

173
00:06:39,473 --> 00:06:41,803
There are some people with murky eyes.

174
00:06:42,143 --> 00:06:44,442
Around 11 o'clock, my eyes will become murky.

175
00:06:44,443 --> 00:06:45,443
Really?

176
00:06:46,113 --> 00:06:47,113
That's okay.

177
00:06:47,773 --> 00:06:48,813
You'll feel hazy.

178
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:51,553
I don't know if I did a good job.

179
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,453
She's cute.

180
00:06:54,053 --> 00:06:59,322
Whom have you talked a lot with?

181
00:06:59,323 --> 00:07:00,593
Only you.

182
00:07:01,323 --> 00:07:03,863
Haven't you talked with someone else 1-on-1?

183
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:07,133
Honestly, I hardly talked with men.

184
00:07:07,363 --> 00:07:09,103
I don't really know who is who.

185
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:12,102
Ye Rin is only talking about Kyung Seok,

186
00:07:12,103 --> 00:07:14,273
and she's only curious about him.

187
00:07:15,473 --> 00:07:17,203
I think...

188
00:07:18,543 --> 00:07:23,312
I'm not sure, but it's best to act how you feel.

189
00:07:23,313 --> 00:07:25,283
Without feeling much pressure.

190
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:28,323
I'm timid.

191
00:07:29,823 --> 00:07:31,592
- Really? - Gosh.

192
00:07:31,593 --> 00:07:33,023
It's okay.

193
00:07:34,123 --> 00:07:37,463
I need to use the restroom.

194
00:07:37,993 --> 00:07:38,993
Let's go.

195
00:07:40,463 --> 00:07:41,502
(Their conversation ended short contrary to Ye Rin's wishes.)

196
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:42,563
The chat is over.

197
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:44,503
He doesn't notice Ye Rin's feelings at all.

198
00:07:44,873 --> 00:07:47,172
It's not that he doesn't notice.

199
00:07:47,173 --> 00:07:49,542
Her enthusiasm seems to make him push her away.

200
00:07:49,543 --> 00:07:51,573
That's how I see it.

201
00:07:51,673 --> 00:07:53,573
But Ye Rin is so pretty.

202
00:07:54,813 --> 00:07:57,143
(After her conversation with Kyung Seok,)

203
00:07:57,613 --> 00:08:00,713
(Ye Rin has a lot on her mind.)

204
00:08:01,213 --> 00:08:03,653
I had to think a lot about it.

205
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:09,062
Last year, I was eliminated quite fast,

206
00:08:09,063 --> 00:08:10,923
so it was disappointing.

207
00:08:12,663 --> 00:08:15,702
Ye Rin is trying to talk to Kyung Seok again.

208
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:16,863
She seems to be looking for him.

209
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:20,433
I want to meet a good person this time.

210
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,903
That's why I wanted to talk to him again.

211
00:08:25,613 --> 00:08:27,013
Where is he?

212
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,913
(While she was looking for Kyung Seok)

213
00:08:30,183 --> 00:08:31,213
I think so.

214
00:08:31,313 --> 00:08:32,652
- Goodness. - What?

215
00:08:32,653 --> 00:08:35,322
(He was chatting with Soo Jin.)

216
00:08:35,323 --> 00:08:36,352
Oh, no.

217
00:08:36,353 --> 00:08:37,993
He's talking with Soo Jin.

218
00:08:38,523 --> 00:08:42,362
She slipped out quickly as if she didn't see them.

219
00:08:42,363 --> 00:08:45,932
She turned away like she didn't see them.

220
00:08:45,933 --> 00:08:47,862
To avoid making him feel uncomfortable, right?

221
00:08:47,863 --> 00:08:49,062
(Kyung Seok and Ye Rin's conversation a few hours ago)

222
00:08:49,063 --> 00:08:50,903
I saw you on a date with someone.

223
00:08:51,263 --> 00:08:53,102
Is she Number 25?

224
00:08:53,103 --> 00:08:54,702
- Is it her? - The one who came as the catfish.

225
00:08:54,703 --> 00:08:56,443
Why Number 25?

226
00:08:56,873 --> 00:08:58,812
Men's speed trains went first, right?

227
00:08:58,813 --> 00:09:01,213
- Right. - She chose me that time.

228
00:09:01,543 --> 00:09:03,713
That's when we went on a date together.

229
00:09:06,453 --> 00:09:09,883
When I mustered up the courage to talk to him,

230
00:09:10,353 --> 00:09:12,723
reality hit me.

231
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:14,523
Oh, no.

232
00:09:15,693 --> 00:09:18,063
What do I do?

233
00:09:19,363 --> 00:09:20,462
She couldn't try...

234
00:09:20,463 --> 00:09:22,702
any of the flirting techniques that she had prepared.

235
00:09:22,703 --> 00:09:25,203
- I know. - She only talked about his eyelids.

236
00:09:26,773 --> 00:09:29,173
(At that moment, the alarm goes off in the single zone.)

237
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:33,743
Now, a secret favorability vote will start.

238
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:35,743
What's this again?

239
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:39,382
Please choose two people you want to see the most right now.

240
00:09:39,383 --> 00:09:40,383
Two people?

241
00:09:40,783 --> 00:09:43,852
The result will be applied to your next date.

242
00:09:43,853 --> 00:09:44,853
Two people?
(Sighing)

243
00:09:45,854 --> 00:09:48,363
Two people? It's so easy for me.

244
00:09:48,893 --> 00:09:52,563
The voting result will not be revealed.

245
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:54,033
It won't be revealed?

246
00:09:54,133 --> 00:09:55,463
I guess it really is a secret.

247
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,332
It's a chance to get to know the person of their choice...

248
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,872
one more time without pressure.

249
00:09:58,873 --> 00:10:00,133
(The secret favorability vote ends.)

250
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:03,042
They will be going on dates outdoors.

251
00:10:03,043 --> 00:10:04,912
- Yes. - They could compare...

252
00:10:04,913 --> 00:10:06,612
the person that likes them...

253
00:10:06,613 --> 00:10:08,482
with the person that they like.

254
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,382
They could find out with whom they get along better.

255
00:10:10,383 --> 00:10:12,913
To whom they lean towards will be more clear.

256
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:14,552
They must be excited about their date outdoors.

257
00:10:14,553 --> 00:10:15,553
(Which couple will go on a date outdoors?)

258
00:10:15,554 --> 00:10:16,683
- First... - Who is it?

259
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,523
- It's Sang Gyeong. - Sang Gyeong.

260
00:10:19,323 --> 00:10:20,523
Who is he going on a date with?

261
00:10:21,493 --> 00:10:24,492
(Sang Gyeong's date is?)

262
00:10:24,493 --> 00:10:25,493
Hello.

263
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:27,793
This is amazing.

264
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,233
- Gosh, hello. - Soo Jin?

265
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:34,033
Hello. Are we going on an outdoor date?

266
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,443
I think so.

267
00:10:36,043 --> 00:10:38,273
(How did she end up going on an outdoor date with Sang Gyeong?)

268
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:44,413
(In Round 3, Soo Jin rejected Kun Hee.)

269
00:10:45,213 --> 00:10:48,082
I voted for Number 24.

270
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,953
(She had Sang Gyeong in mind.)

271
00:10:50,053 --> 00:10:52,822
Soo Jin had Sang Gyeong in mind,

272
00:10:52,823 --> 00:10:55,163
so she refused Kun Hee during Round Three.

273
00:10:57,163 --> 00:11:00,033
(Soo Jin came to Palace Week as an additional resident.)

274
00:11:00,363 --> 00:11:01,603
Hello.

275
00:11:01,963 --> 00:11:03,032
May I sit here?

276
00:11:03,033 --> 00:11:04,903
(The first person to catch her attention...)

277
00:11:05,003 --> 00:11:06,003
(Number 24, Lee Sang Gyeong)

278
00:11:06,004 --> 00:11:09,503
Soo Jin has always been aware of Sang Gyeong.

279
00:11:10,973 --> 00:11:14,943
The person I'm most interested in from the single zone is Sang Gyeong.

280
00:11:16,483 --> 00:11:19,353
The one who's proactive will gain love.

281
00:11:21,523 --> 00:11:23,453
Have you been on an outdoor date?

282
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,452
- No. - Am I your first date?

283
00:11:25,453 --> 00:11:26,823
Yes.

284
00:11:26,923 --> 00:11:28,893
- She's smiling with her eyes. - She's smiling with her eyes.

285
00:11:29,363 --> 00:11:30,393
She must be so happy.

286
00:11:32,493 --> 00:11:33,493
Oh, wow.

287
00:11:34,163 --> 00:11:36,302
(The door opens again?)

288
00:11:36,303 --> 00:11:39,233
- I'll sit in the back. - No, stay there.

289
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,502
(There's another girl who's joining Sang Gyeong and Soo Jin.)

290
00:11:40,503 --> 00:11:42,303
Someone else is here. I guess it's not a 1-on-1 date.

291
00:11:42,573 --> 00:11:43,573
Are the three of us going on a date?

292
00:11:43,574 --> 00:11:45,113
The three of us on a date?

293
00:11:45,813 --> 00:11:46,813
What's going on?

294
00:11:47,743 --> 00:11:49,342
- This is crazy. - What a bummer.

295
00:11:49,343 --> 00:11:51,343
I was happy thinking it would be just the two of us.

296
00:11:51,783 --> 00:11:53,283
- It's Jin Ju. - I see.

297
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,752
Sang Gyeong is really popular.

298
00:11:55,753 --> 00:11:56,753
Right.

299
00:11:56,923 --> 00:11:58,853
I'm very shocked right now.

300
00:11:59,223 --> 00:12:00,592
- Are you happy? - How do you feel?

301
00:12:00,593 --> 00:12:01,822
You're happy. Aren't you happy?

302
00:12:01,823 --> 00:12:03,362
You're going on a date with two women.

303
00:12:03,363 --> 00:12:04,723
I wasn't sure what was going on.

304
00:12:04,863 --> 00:12:06,863
I didn't even know what to say.

305
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:08,403
I was having a mental breakdown.

306
00:12:09,433 --> 00:12:12,103
(How will their date turn out?)

307
00:12:13,503 --> 00:12:14,703
I was his first wife, though.

308
00:12:16,743 --> 00:12:18,772
Usually, the concubines have more power.

309
00:12:18,773 --> 00:12:21,213
(Usually, the concubines have more power.)

310
00:12:21,643 --> 00:12:25,213
But still. Our tie can't be broken that easily.

311
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:29,923
A newcomer can drive out the old-timer.

312
00:12:31,023 --> 00:12:32,292
Am I too mean?

313
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,653
They entered Palace Week because they matched.

314
00:12:34,893 --> 00:12:36,323
But I'm the third wheel.

315
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:38,563
I need to mess things up.

316
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,093
I'm in trouble now, aren't I?

317
00:12:41,863 --> 00:12:44,902
I think Soo Jin is determined to get her way.

318
00:12:44,903 --> 00:12:47,772
Here's the thing. Sang Gyeong and Jin Ju...

319
00:12:47,773 --> 00:12:49,742
spent more time together.

320
00:12:49,743 --> 00:12:51,272
- Right. - For Soo Jin to insert herself...

321
00:12:51,273 --> 00:12:52,772
between them,

322
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:54,412
- she will have to work hard. - Make sense.

323
00:12:54,413 --> 00:12:56,683
(The three of them arrive at the date spot.)

324
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:59,783
Nonetheless, let's pick some delicious dishes.

325
00:13:00,053 --> 00:13:01,252
This looks tasty.

326
00:13:01,253 --> 00:13:02,753
Should we order both?

327
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:04,182
- Yes. - Let's order both.

328
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:05,522
Should we order both and share them?

329
00:13:05,523 --> 00:13:07,423
We're turning quite greedy.

330
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:09,562
You say that now, but you won't eat a lot, right?

331
00:13:09,563 --> 00:13:11,123
Her portion is small.

332
00:13:11,293 --> 00:13:14,033
I noticed that you didn't finish your breakfast.

333
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:16,363
I'm not sure if it was because the food wasn't good.

334
00:13:16,603 --> 00:13:18,873
I went for seconds.

335
00:13:19,473 --> 00:13:21,233
I bet I ate the most among the women.

336
00:13:21,873 --> 00:13:23,103
My gosh. Look at that.

337
00:13:23,173 --> 00:13:24,703
I filled up my rice bowl,

338
00:13:25,713 --> 00:13:27,012
- Okay. - but I wasn't full.

339
00:13:27,013 --> 00:13:28,073
I see.

340
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,513
What kind of food do you not like?

341
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,182
I'm good with anything.

342
00:13:33,183 --> 00:13:35,082
There isn't anything I can't eat. Seriously.

343
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,953
- I can literally eat everything. - Really?

344
00:13:37,553 --> 00:13:38,623
That's impressive.

345
00:13:40,293 --> 00:13:42,062
I like big eaters.

346
00:13:42,063 --> 00:13:43,163
- Is that so? - Yes.

347
00:13:44,923 --> 00:13:46,433
- You guys are very different. - Yes.

348
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,603
- Is there anything you can't eat? - Me?

349
00:13:51,233 --> 00:13:53,773
First of all, I don't like gukbap.

350
00:13:54,073 --> 00:13:55,602
- Oh, no. - Really?

351
00:13:55,603 --> 00:13:56,703
Oh, no.

352
00:13:56,873 --> 00:13:58,673
A lot of men like gukbap.

353
00:13:59,473 --> 00:14:01,642
- Gukbap. - I love gukbap.

354
00:14:01,643 --> 00:14:02,643
My gosh.

355
00:14:02,644 --> 00:14:04,583
My favorite dish is seolleongtang.

356
00:14:05,313 --> 00:14:06,682
It makes me sound like an old man.

357
00:14:06,683 --> 00:14:07,912
(Feeling a strange sense of despair)

358
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:10,222
Gukbap is like the national anthem for men.

359
00:14:10,223 --> 00:14:12,693
- Gukbap is the national anthem? - Yes. That's how important it is.

360
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,763
Some people might think I'm making a fuss.

361
00:14:15,863 --> 00:14:18,022
But when I have gukbap, I don't mix rice in the soup.

362
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,162
Same here. I only scoop up the broth like this.

363
00:14:20,163 --> 00:14:21,962
Because there's too much salt in the broth.

364
00:14:21,963 --> 00:14:23,902
- Same here. - I always leave some broth.

365
00:14:23,903 --> 00:14:26,002
(The gukbap talk continues between Jin Ju and Sang Gyeong.)

366
00:14:26,003 --> 00:14:29,103
(Soo Jin can't get a word in.)

367
00:14:29,343 --> 00:14:30,873
A sense of alienation? Jealousy?

368
00:14:30,973 --> 00:14:32,473
It was uncomfortable.

369
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:34,142
(The food is served to alleviate her discomfort.)

370
00:14:34,143 --> 00:14:35,843
- Thank you. - Seriously.

371
00:14:36,713 --> 00:14:38,582
- Enjoy. - Thank you for the food.

372
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:39,753
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

373
00:14:41,783 --> 00:14:43,723
Sang Gyeong, do you want some of this?

374
00:14:44,353 --> 00:14:46,022
Should I give you some of my pasta?

375
00:14:46,023 --> 00:14:47,193
(Jin Ju's already serving Sang Gyeong.)

376
00:14:47,823 --> 00:14:49,693
- She's already... - She's quick.

377
00:14:49,963 --> 00:14:51,662
- She's already serving him. - Have that first.

378
00:14:51,663 --> 00:14:53,293
I'll eat this first. I'll get more later.

379
00:14:54,063 --> 00:14:55,602
- Then I'll just go ahead and eat. - Yes.

380
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,863
Dig in. Go ahead.

381
00:14:58,803 --> 00:15:00,573
I was cutting the pizza.

382
00:15:01,003 --> 00:15:03,343
Soo Jin asked him if he wanted the pasta.

383
00:15:03,773 --> 00:15:05,273
He ate my pizza first.

384
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:08,883
I loved that.

385
00:15:11,213 --> 00:15:12,612
(The mood is very different for these two women.)

386
00:15:12,613 --> 00:15:13,953
Oh, no. Poor Soo Jin.

387
00:15:14,183 --> 00:15:15,883
Of course, she's thirsty.

388
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:18,923
- This just crossed my mind. - Yes.

389
00:15:20,493 --> 00:15:22,963
Jin Ju, what about me do you find attractive?

390
00:15:23,593 --> 00:15:27,733
(His question catches her by surprise.)

391
00:15:28,503 --> 00:15:31,302
All of a sudden, he asked me what I liked about him.

392
00:15:31,303 --> 00:15:32,573
He asked me that.

393
00:15:33,303 --> 00:15:34,933
There were three of us at the table,

394
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:38,273
but to me, it felt like he chose me.

395
00:15:40,743 --> 00:15:43,683
Jin Ju, what about me do you find attractive?

396
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,853
(Right now?)

397
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,312
Do I have to answer in public like this?

398
00:15:48,313 --> 00:15:50,252
No, you don't have to answer it. But that just crossed my mind.

399
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:52,092
- Yeah? I'll tell you later. - Yes.

400
00:15:52,093 --> 00:15:53,153
Okay. Thank you.

401
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,492
(Things are getting romantic between Sang Gyeong and Jin Ju.)

402
00:15:55,493 --> 00:15:58,592
Gosh, it looks like it's only the two of them at the restaurant.

403
00:15:58,593 --> 00:15:59,732
They click so well.

404
00:15:59,733 --> 00:16:01,033
- Right. - Soo Jin has nothing to say.

405
00:16:01,663 --> 00:16:03,102
I'll stop talking.

406
00:16:03,103 --> 00:16:04,733
Why not? Come on, talk.

407
00:16:05,803 --> 00:16:06,873
It's...

408
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:08,803
I don't know.

409
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:14,513
It didn't feel like he was expressing any interest in me.

410
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:18,113
So I don't know what to do.

411
00:16:18,653 --> 00:16:20,852
(Feeling dazed)

412
00:16:20,853 --> 00:16:22,882
When the 3 of them are on a date, but the 2 of them click so well,

413
00:16:22,883 --> 00:16:25,393
- it feels so awkward. - Right. You have nothing to say.

414
00:16:26,493 --> 00:16:27,922
(Another outdoor date is taking place here.)

415
00:16:27,923 --> 00:16:29,023
There's another one.

416
00:16:30,763 --> 00:16:32,433
It's Young Taek.

417
00:16:34,563 --> 00:16:36,362
- Joo Hee. - My gosh. No.

418
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:37,363
This is crazy.

419
00:16:38,703 --> 00:16:40,373
- Joo Hee. Can we talk for a bit? - Yes?

420
00:16:40,673 --> 00:16:42,743
(He approached Joo Hee and pulled her away for a chat.)

421
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:48,373
(He carefully expressed his interest in Joo Hee.)

422
00:16:48,843 --> 00:16:50,843
I was shaking like crazy. I was a baby bird.

423
00:16:51,283 --> 00:16:52,652
I was shaking.

424
00:16:52,653 --> 00:16:54,013
You are

425
00:16:54,653 --> 00:16:57,582
A lot of musicians bring their dates to their studios where they work...

426
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,052
- Right. - when they want to impress them.

427
00:16:59,053 --> 00:17:00,193
- That's right. - Yes.

428
00:17:00,323 --> 00:17:01,653
He's indeed working in it.

429
00:17:02,863 --> 00:17:03,962
I've been there and done that.

430
00:17:03,963 --> 00:17:06,133
(She's been there.)

431
00:17:06,563 --> 00:17:08,532
Right. I mentioned you in my interview.

432
00:17:08,533 --> 00:17:10,762
The guy who sang "Sudden Shower."

433
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:14,073
You are a present to me

434
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:15,602
But the song suits you...

435
00:17:15,603 --> 00:17:17,943
because you resemble Byeon Woo Seok.

436
00:17:18,373 --> 00:17:19,513
- I resemble Byeon Woo Seok? - Yes.

437
00:17:20,113 --> 00:17:21,473
I mean, you have a similar vibe.

438
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:24,213
He's the one whom we'd call a sweet big dog.

439
00:17:24,913 --> 00:17:26,383
He's the perfect example of it.

440
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:29,722
Why? Sweet? Big?

441
00:17:29,723 --> 00:17:30,752
No, medium-sized?

442
00:17:30,753 --> 00:17:31,753
- A Samoyed! - So...

443
00:17:32,023 --> 00:17:33,692
- A Samoyed? - You're a Samoyed.

444
00:17:33,693 --> 00:17:35,423
Yes, that's it. So cute.

445
00:17:36,863 --> 00:17:40,692
Joo Hee is great at complimenting people.

446
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:41,732
- Right. - She has...

447
00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:46,972
this talent of making anything uncomfortable disappear.

448
00:17:46,973 --> 00:17:49,872
That's her charm.

449
00:17:49,873 --> 00:17:51,872
Well, things seem to be going so well for them.

450
00:17:51,873 --> 00:17:54,512
But all I see is Jae Yeon sitting in the empty middle seat.

451
00:17:54,513 --> 00:17:56,012
Right!

452
00:17:56,013 --> 00:17:57,812
It feels as if his spirit is sitting there.

453
00:17:57,813 --> 00:17:59,453
- Poor Jae Yeon. - Yes.

454
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:01,213
What's Jae Yeon doing right now?

455
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:03,923
(Meanwhile, what's Jae Yeon up to?)

456
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,122
(The single zone)

457
00:18:05,123 --> 00:18:07,452
(Jae Yeon and Na Kyung are talking.)

458
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,193
Seriously. You're a rare find.

459
00:18:09,863 --> 00:18:11,932
This is the vibe I'm getting.

460
00:18:11,933 --> 00:18:13,562
- She seems... - Okay?

461
00:18:13,563 --> 00:18:15,533
a bit uncomfortable because I'm too forward with my feelings.

462
00:18:15,703 --> 00:18:17,862
- You think so? - I'm not sure...

463
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,333
- if it's just in my head. - Okay.

464
00:18:20,273 --> 00:18:22,603
I noticed that she began to take an interest...

465
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,343
- That's possible. - in other people.

466
00:18:25,473 --> 00:18:27,643
But I could be getting in her way.

467
00:18:27,813 --> 00:18:29,112
- If she is... - I see.

468
00:18:29,113 --> 00:18:31,243
- serious about it... - Gosh, that's going too far now.

469
00:18:33,013 --> 00:18:34,853
I could be burdening her emotionally.

470
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:36,853
I could be burdening her emotionally.

471
00:18:37,323 --> 00:18:38,652
She could be interested in me.

472
00:18:38,653 --> 00:18:41,992
But if she can't let go of me because she feels guilty...

473
00:18:41,993 --> 00:18:43,063
No way. Come on.

474
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,992
If that's the case, I should...

475
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:49,403
(If that's how she feels, I should step back.)

476
00:18:49,663 --> 00:18:50,962
This isn't easy.

477
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,273
- Right. - It's heartbreaking.

478
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:55,342
If he feels that he's burdening her...

479
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:56,842
- with his feelings... - Right.

480
00:18:56,843 --> 00:18:58,002
- If he's burdening her... - Right.

481
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:00,712
- Gosh. - Then that's frustrating.

482
00:19:00,713 --> 00:19:02,812
What if he keeps thinking like this and leaves her?

483
00:19:02,813 --> 00:19:04,283
That's a possibility.

484
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:09,653
(Jin Ju and Sang Gyeong came back from the outdoor date.)

485
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,552
I want to go out.

486
00:19:11,553 --> 00:19:12,893
- I'm getting a slight cabin fever. - Right?

487
00:19:13,323 --> 00:19:14,453
Do you want to step out?

488
00:19:14,893 --> 00:19:16,562
- I want to step on the snow. - Same here.

489
00:19:16,563 --> 00:19:17,693
Just that, nothing else.

490
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,633
- It's so cool out. Fresh. - My gosh, it's...

491
00:19:21,763 --> 00:19:23,803
The snow's so soft, right?

492
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:24,963
It feels great.

493
00:19:26,273 --> 00:19:27,433
I love it here.

494
00:19:29,973 --> 00:19:32,142
(The men and women in the single zone...)

495
00:19:32,143 --> 00:19:33,813
(go back to their childhood and have fun with the snow fight.)

496
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:35,213
So funny!

497
00:19:35,413 --> 00:19:38,853
(They're having more fun because they're together.)

498
00:19:39,213 --> 00:19:40,912
We were having a snow fight.

499
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:43,523
I still have the innocence of childhood at heart.

500
00:19:43,923 --> 00:19:46,692
I like someone who can enjoy these activities with me.

501
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:47,822
Can we make a snowman?

502
00:19:47,823 --> 00:19:49,523
- Do you want to make one? - Let's make one.

503
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:52,232
There's Hye Won.

504
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:54,363
- Gosh, you're so good! - She saw them.

505
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,762
- It's so easy to clump the snow. - Gosh, she saw them.

506
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:58,163
- Oh, no. - My gosh.

507
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:02,143
Jae Keun and Jin Ju were getting along so well.

508
00:20:02,473 --> 00:20:03,802
I kept observing them.

509
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:05,173
Gosh, Sang Gyeong saw them too.

510
00:20:05,443 --> 00:20:06,543
He should go out.

511
00:20:06,813 --> 00:20:08,472
We'll make a snowman for the show.

512
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:09,613
(Sang Gyeong comes out to look for Jin Ju.)

513
00:20:10,413 --> 00:20:12,512
- Help me. - Okay.

514
00:20:12,513 --> 00:20:13,612
The body and the face.

515
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:14,953
(No need to fret, Sang Gyeong is rolling the snow.)

516
00:20:15,253 --> 00:20:17,022
- Could you put it on here? - Oh?

517
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,082
Put it there, please.

518
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,193
(You want me to lift it?)

519
00:20:20,723 --> 00:20:22,722
He can't lift heavy things. I have to lift it for him.

520
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:23,762
(Hands empty)

521
00:20:23,763 --> 00:20:25,093
- But it's lopsided. - My gosh.

522
00:20:25,733 --> 00:20:27,432
- That's the body. - Gosh, that's crazy.

523
00:20:27,433 --> 00:20:28,433
(There's another one.)

524
00:20:28,434 --> 00:20:29,932
- Let's make a three-layered Olaf. - That's...

525
00:20:29,933 --> 00:20:30,962
(This one is even bigger than the other one.)

526
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:32,633
- He can't lift heavy things. - He can't lift that.

527
00:20:32,903 --> 00:20:34,233
We need to carry this.

528
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,473
- I'll do it. - Hold on.

529
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:40,073
- Okay. - Okay.

530
00:20:40,343 --> 00:20:41,643
- My gosh. - You're so cool. Okay.

531
00:20:41,813 --> 00:20:43,042
- This is scary. - Okay.

532
00:20:43,043 --> 00:20:44,483
(Sang Gyeong just cheers them on.)

533
00:20:44,713 --> 00:20:45,752
- That's crazy. - One more.

534
00:20:45,753 --> 00:20:47,253
- That's cool. - You're so strong.

535
00:20:47,753 --> 00:20:49,283
- I had fun thanks to you. - Seriously.

536
00:20:49,653 --> 00:20:52,192
I didn't know this many people would be good at building snowmen.

537
00:20:52,193 --> 00:20:53,593
(Just like the piled-up snow, they begin to bond more deeply.)

538
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,723
- Did you talk to a lot of people? - Yes, sort of.

539
00:20:57,163 --> 00:20:59,192
Sang Gyeong is a cautious type too.

540
00:20:59,193 --> 00:21:00,193
- Right. - Yes.

541
00:21:00,563 --> 00:21:02,203
- You have different charms. - Me...

542
00:21:02,863 --> 00:21:04,432
- A retriever I'd like to adopt. - I do have other charms.

543
00:21:04,433 --> 00:21:05,633
- You want to adopt me? - Yes.

544
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,073
- Let's go home. - My gosh. Really?

545
00:21:09,043 --> 00:21:10,173
Adopt me then.

546
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:11,872
My goodness.

547
00:21:11,873 --> 00:21:13,142
- I do want to adopt you. - You...

548
00:21:13,143 --> 00:21:14,312
You just have to feed me regularly. I'll be fine.

549
00:21:14,313 --> 00:21:16,242
- Really? That's great. - I'll go out and make money.

550
00:21:16,243 --> 00:21:17,343
That's great.

551
00:21:18,483 --> 00:21:20,312
Gosh, I'm not sure about these two.

552
00:21:20,313 --> 00:21:21,652
I can't predict how things will go...

553
00:21:21,653 --> 00:21:23,053
- in the single zone. - Totally.

554
00:21:23,553 --> 00:21:26,322
I started to get to know you...

555
00:21:26,323 --> 00:21:28,622
since yesterday. Right?

556
00:21:28,623 --> 00:21:29,763
Yes. That's right.

557
00:21:29,823 --> 00:21:34,192
To me, you came out of nowhere like a comet.

558
00:21:34,193 --> 00:21:35,193
I see.

559
00:21:35,194 --> 00:21:36,462
- By the way, - So the truth is...

560
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:39,003
- I feel the same way about you. - Yes.

561
00:21:39,533 --> 00:21:41,773
To me, you showed up out of the blue like a comet.

562
00:21:42,003 --> 00:21:44,103
I came here with a light heart.

563
00:21:44,243 --> 00:21:45,812
But when we were on the marriage-focused date,

564
00:21:45,813 --> 00:21:47,012
you and I clicked so well.

565
00:21:47,013 --> 00:21:50,043
- You were exactly what I imagined. - Yes.

566
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:52,852
- So... - This is hard.

567
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,782
- My gosh. - Isn't that Hye Won?

568
00:21:54,783 --> 00:21:57,683
Hye Won lowered her head. Oh, no.

569
00:21:58,183 --> 00:21:59,192
So...

570
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:00,222
(The two of them continue their conversation.)

571
00:22:00,223 --> 00:22:03,522
To be honest, I'm attracted to you.

572
00:22:03,523 --> 00:22:05,322
- We're so compatible. - Right.

573
00:22:05,323 --> 00:22:06,632
- We just met. - Right.

574
00:22:06,633 --> 00:22:07,962
- But we're so compatible. - Yes.

575
00:22:07,963 --> 00:22:09,402
After getting that feeling...

576
00:22:09,403 --> 00:22:11,232
Let's be honest. You and Sang Gyeong...

577
00:22:11,233 --> 00:22:13,672
- have been going on dates... - Right.

578
00:22:13,673 --> 00:22:15,333
consistently from the beginning.

579
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:17,073
I see.

580
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:18,873
I see.

581
00:22:19,873 --> 00:22:21,112
(Sang Gyeong walks past them this time.)

582
00:22:21,113 --> 00:22:22,683
- Gosh, it's Sang Gyeong. - It's Sang Gyeong.

583
00:22:23,513 --> 00:22:24,643
You look cute.

584
00:22:25,653 --> 00:22:26,712
Yes.

585
00:22:26,713 --> 00:22:28,252
It's clear that Sang Gyeong...

586
00:22:28,253 --> 00:22:29,852
keeps checking what she's up to.

587
00:22:29,853 --> 00:22:31,323
He keeps glancing at her.

588
00:22:33,223 --> 00:22:35,492
(Meanwhile, in the women's lounge...)

589
00:22:35,493 --> 00:22:38,192
What was he like? The professor.

590
00:22:38,193 --> 00:22:40,863
He's such a great guy.

591
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,633
(Sang Joon has a cheerful charm.)

592
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:45,903
But I don't find him handsome.

593
00:22:46,103 --> 00:22:47,802
- That's so important. - Yes.

594
00:22:47,803 --> 00:22:49,342
Right. It's like...

595
00:22:49,343 --> 00:22:52,213
- You have to be attracted to him. - Right.

596
00:22:52,473 --> 00:22:54,542
I don't find him attractive.

597
00:22:54,543 --> 00:22:56,512
- That's the most important. - Yes.

598
00:22:56,513 --> 00:22:57,882
How can you date him then?

599
00:22:57,883 --> 00:22:59,813
If you can't kiss him, you can't date him.

600
00:23:00,353 --> 00:23:02,223
- My gosh. - I...

601
00:23:02,953 --> 00:23:05,792
- What is it? - I thought of "The Frog Prince."

602
00:23:05,793 --> 00:23:08,123
(The Frog Prince has come to life from the fairy tale.)

603
00:23:08,293 --> 00:23:09,892
A lot of people check the possibility of dating...

604
00:23:09,893 --> 00:23:11,722
by considering whether they can be physically intimate with someone.

605
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,162
- A lot of people use that... - Right.

606
00:23:13,163 --> 00:23:14,963
- as their standard. - Yes.

607
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:17,433
I decided to muster up my courage today.

608
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:19,403
I'll do my best today.

609
00:23:19,573 --> 00:23:21,633
- Anyway, I'll give it a try. - I'll try it.

610
00:23:22,173 --> 00:23:24,073
(When Jae Keun walked in as the additional resident,)

611
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:28,513
(she noticed that she was happy.)

612
00:23:28,643 --> 00:23:31,843
- I see. She's interested in him? - Really?

613
00:23:31,883 --> 00:23:34,383
(Seo Hee was frustrated when he had breakfast with another woman.)

614
00:23:34,853 --> 00:23:38,323
Seo Hee declared that she'd go after him.

615
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,723
- Could you give me a moment? - Sure.

616
00:23:45,063 --> 00:23:46,963
Since I made up my mind,

617
00:23:47,133 --> 00:23:48,532
I had to give it a try.

618
00:23:48,533 --> 00:23:49,833
I should do whatever I can.

619
00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:52,773
(The two of them went to talk in private.)

620
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:55,203
There's something I want to give you.

621
00:23:55,503 --> 00:23:56,503
What is it?

622
00:23:56,773 --> 00:23:58,003
It's nothing much.

623
00:24:00,543 --> 00:24:01,613
What's that?

624
00:24:02,313 --> 00:24:03,513
I made it myself.

625
00:24:03,983 --> 00:24:05,342
- You made it? - Yes.

626
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:07,783
She made it herself. That's so cute.

627
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:09,753
This is so cute.

628
00:24:10,053 --> 00:24:11,723
- What is this? A puppy? - Yes.

629
00:24:12,023 --> 00:24:14,322
(Jae Keun's keyword was a sweet, large dog.)

630
00:24:14,323 --> 00:24:18,522
Well, when I realized that you were eliminated from the show,

631
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:19,533
this...

632
00:24:20,533 --> 00:24:21,533
crossed my mind.

633
00:24:22,433 --> 00:24:24,433
"I'll end up meeting him no matter what."

634
00:24:25,233 --> 00:24:26,733
- But I was eliminated by then. - Right.

635
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:28,732
She had no idea he'd come,

636
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:30,072
- but she still made the doll. - Right.

637
00:24:30,073 --> 00:24:31,202
That's so cute.

638
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:32,812
I wanted to give it to you someday.

639
00:24:32,813 --> 00:24:34,643
I brought it with me just in case.

640
00:24:35,443 --> 00:24:37,113
I'm happy that I can give it to you.

641
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:40,753
- Thank you so much. - Sure.

642
00:24:40,883 --> 00:24:42,923
She made a doll for me.

643
00:24:43,053 --> 00:24:44,653
I thought that she couldn't be faking it.

644
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:47,553
I could feel how sincere she was about me. Seriously.

645
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:53,863
Well, this is...

646
00:24:55,033 --> 00:24:57,702
To be honest, when I first met you,

647
00:24:57,703 --> 00:24:58,733
I was so surprised.

648
00:24:59,733 --> 00:25:01,633
And that someone like you...

649
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:04,642
chose me for your date.

650
00:25:04,643 --> 00:25:07,043
In the beginning, it felt surreal.

651
00:25:07,513 --> 00:25:08,842
That's how I felt.

652
00:25:08,843 --> 00:25:10,413
So I was thrilled.

653
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,653
But to be honest,

654
00:25:14,413 --> 00:25:17,082
I'm quite indecisive.

655
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:19,252
I'm sure you felt it too.

656
00:25:19,253 --> 00:25:21,923
Actually, putting aside the fact that I'm your fan,

657
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:28,033
I thought the right thing to do here was to make up my mind.

658
00:25:28,933 --> 00:25:31,903
To be honest with you, right now,

659
00:25:32,233 --> 00:25:36,503
I'm interested in getting to know Jin Ju more.

660
00:25:38,143 --> 00:25:39,213
I see.

661
00:25:40,643 --> 00:25:43,243
I wanted to get to know her more,

662
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:48,883
so I decided to have breakfast with her.

663
00:25:49,053 --> 00:25:51,583
And Female Number 19...

664
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:53,553
She came as a catfish.

665
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:56,593
Out of the blue, she gave me her vote.

666
00:25:57,363 --> 00:26:00,162
So I was like, "What's going on?"

667
00:26:00,163 --> 00:26:02,903
I was flustered when it happened.

668
00:26:09,273 --> 00:26:11,302
Then did you just turn me down?

669
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,343
- Turn you down? So... - No?

670
00:26:13,943 --> 00:26:15,612
Seriously. I...

671
00:26:15,613 --> 00:26:17,883
No? Not yet, right?

672
00:26:17,983 --> 00:26:19,313
There's hope for me, right?

673
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:21,083
No?

674
00:26:24,453 --> 00:26:25,453
So...

675
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:30,463
for now...

676
00:26:32,363 --> 00:26:33,863
Well, this is...

677
00:26:34,663 --> 00:26:39,433
(Do you not even have an ounce of interest in me?)

678
00:26:43,703 --> 00:26:46,573
No. So my conclusion is...

679
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:49,883
that...

680
00:26:50,143 --> 00:26:53,112
I'll go with the person I feel more drawn to.

681
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:54,212
(It will be either Jin Ju or Hye Won.)

682
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:55,483
That will be my decision.

683
00:27:02,023 --> 00:27:03,262
At first, I wasn't sure if I was interested...

684
00:27:03,263 --> 00:27:04,492
or if I was just being a fan.

685
00:27:04,493 --> 00:27:07,593
I didn't know what I was feeling then.

686
00:27:08,233 --> 00:27:10,233
I didn't think it'd be fair...

687
00:27:11,233 --> 00:27:12,772
if I kept stringing her along.

688
00:27:12,773 --> 00:27:15,843
I thought it was fair to tell her how I felt.

689
00:27:19,443 --> 00:27:20,843
I understand.

690
00:27:23,543 --> 00:27:28,013
(Seo Hee goes back disappointed.)

691
00:27:29,353 --> 00:27:32,153
(The connection between Jae Keun and Seo Hee began from Round 1.)

692
00:27:32,353 --> 00:27:34,493
The person I want to get to know more...

693
00:27:35,023 --> 00:27:36,523
I wrote down some topics.

694
00:27:36,663 --> 00:27:39,993
The one I want to have more conversations with is Jae Keun.

695
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:45,233
I was happy to see Male Number Three the most.

696
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,503
I was happy.

697
00:27:52,873 --> 00:27:56,283
I don't think I gave my 100 percent.

698
00:28:08,323 --> 00:28:10,893
I didn't know I'd be this foolish.

699
00:28:17,263 --> 00:28:18,633
It's disappointing.

700
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,042
Seo Hee mustered up her courage and expressed her interest.

701
00:28:24,043 --> 00:28:26,612
But Jae Keun turned her down.

702
00:28:26,613 --> 00:28:28,613
- Yes. He told her how he felt. - Yes.

703
00:28:28,843 --> 00:28:29,913
But...

704
00:28:30,113 --> 00:28:32,583
- this could be better for her. - Yes. I agree.

705
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,722
(Seo Hee comes back to the women's lounge...)

706
00:28:37,723 --> 00:28:39,023
(after sorting out her feelings.)

707
00:28:39,353 --> 00:28:41,123
He turned me down.

708
00:28:41,993 --> 00:28:43,723
Jae Keun turned you down?

709
00:28:44,763 --> 00:28:45,963
Just like that?

710
00:28:47,363 --> 00:28:49,063
There's nothing I can do if we don't click.

711
00:28:51,003 --> 00:28:52,903
- You expressed yourself boldly. - Yes.

712
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:57,873
Jae Keun will go after Jin Ju.

713
00:28:58,043 --> 00:28:59,472
Jae Keun will go after Jin Ju.

714
00:28:59,473 --> 00:29:00,473
(Seo Hee says that he will only focus on Jin Ju.)

715
00:29:00,474 --> 00:29:02,543
Why would she say that? That's not true.

716
00:29:02,843 --> 00:29:04,742
- No! He's also interested... - What? That's not true!

717
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,612
- in Hye Won. - That's...

718
00:29:06,613 --> 00:29:09,753
- It will cause a misunderstanding. - He named Jin Ju and Hye Won.

719
00:29:09,983 --> 00:29:11,652
Her mind was all over the place.

720
00:29:11,653 --> 00:29:13,722
She couldn't hear the last part.

721
00:29:13,723 --> 00:29:15,053
Oh, my goodness.

722
00:29:16,663 --> 00:29:19,633
(Meanwhile, Jae Keun is looking for someone.)

723
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:22,562
I don't know how Female Number 19 feels.

724
00:29:22,563 --> 00:29:24,863
I wanted to talk to her more. I was curious about her.

725
00:29:29,003 --> 00:29:31,573
(Wherever he goes, Hye Won is nowhere to be seen.)

726
00:29:32,873 --> 00:29:36,143
Male Number Three, Jae Keun...

727
00:29:36,413 --> 00:29:38,482
He will go after Jin Ju.

728
00:29:38,483 --> 00:29:40,182
- What is this? - I don't know.

729
00:29:40,183 --> 00:29:41,453
What's going on?

730
00:29:43,253 --> 00:29:46,153
I was trying to find her, but I guess I wasn't any good.

731
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:53,532
(The two of them miss each other with a misunderstanding brewing.)

732
00:29:53,533 --> 00:29:56,662
This misunderstanding can be cleared up...

733
00:29:56,663 --> 00:29:59,902
- if they just talk to each other. - Right.

734
00:29:59,903 --> 00:30:02,272
But if this keeps going, it won't be good.

735
00:30:02,273 --> 00:30:03,872
- I'm worried. - Hye Won is very careful.

736
00:30:03,873 --> 00:30:05,202
- Right. - She rarely talks.

737
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:06,573
- Right. - Yes.

738
00:30:07,443 --> 00:30:10,682
(The night of Day Two rolls in.)

739
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:11,942
They're not back.

740
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:13,382
Who still hasn't returned?

741
00:30:13,383 --> 00:30:15,183
- Male Number 13. - And Joo Hee.

742
00:30:15,353 --> 00:30:16,652
- Joo Hee left too? - The two of them?

743
00:30:16,653 --> 00:30:18,583
- They're still not back? - Still?

744
00:30:18,623 --> 00:30:20,093
- Right. - That's why Jae Yeon...

745
00:30:20,793 --> 00:30:22,823
- Over there. - Right. Jae Yeon was like...

746
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:27,592
Joo Hee hates smokers. So Jae Yeon...

747
00:30:27,593 --> 00:30:28,962
even quit smoking for her.

748
00:30:28,963 --> 00:30:31,002
- It's been a week. - That's true love.

749
00:30:31,003 --> 00:30:32,432
- He smokes a lot. - It's been a week.

750
00:30:32,433 --> 00:30:33,872
But he didn't smoke here.

751
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,232
Wow, that's amazing.

752
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:37,372
But they just met.

753
00:30:37,373 --> 00:30:40,373
I didn't know his feelings could get serious this quickly.

754
00:30:40,473 --> 00:30:42,782
I mean, it's bothering Jae Yeon. But Sang Gyeong...

755
00:30:42,783 --> 00:30:45,243
- is quite bothered by that too. - Yes. Right.

756
00:30:47,213 --> 00:30:48,282
Jae Yeon is back.

757
00:30:48,283 --> 00:30:50,053
(Jae Yeon enters.)

758
00:30:50,923 --> 00:30:52,223
- My gosh. - She's back.

759
00:30:52,423 --> 00:30:54,253
- My gosh. - Look who's here.

760
00:30:55,923 --> 00:30:57,262
You're back from your date.

761
00:30:57,263 --> 00:30:58,693
- Look who's here. - Where have you been?

762
00:30:59,493 --> 00:31:00,532
How did you know?

763
00:31:00,533 --> 00:31:01,963
Was it Male Number 13?

764
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:03,433
I was just making a guess.

765
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:05,032
You were making a guess,

766
00:31:05,033 --> 00:31:06,233
- but you got it right. - Right.

767
00:31:07,273 --> 00:31:11,503
I'm worried because this might be hard on Jae Yeon.

768
00:31:14,213 --> 00:31:16,143
I've been feeling down today.

769
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:20,013
- But can't you just have fun? - What?

770
00:31:20,153 --> 00:31:22,283
You need to check out other people too.

771
00:31:22,613 --> 00:31:24,423
I didn't know I'd be like this either.

772
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:26,822
You're a total catch.

773
00:31:26,823 --> 00:31:29,153
Why won't you hang out with other women?

774
00:31:29,363 --> 00:31:30,422
I just...

775
00:31:30,423 --> 00:31:33,493
want to stick to what I've been doing so far.

776
00:31:33,693 --> 00:31:36,063
Someone who can appreciate that might be the one.

777
00:31:36,963 --> 00:31:38,432
- Right. - That's what destiny is.

778
00:31:38,433 --> 00:31:39,433
Right.

779
00:31:40,603 --> 00:31:42,802
I think it's a difference of personalities.

780
00:31:42,803 --> 00:31:45,302
- That's Jae Yeon. That's who he is. - Yes.

781
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:46,312
- He's loyal. - Yes.

782
00:31:46,313 --> 00:31:48,343
- Yes, it looks like it. - Just goes for one person.

783
00:31:49,613 --> 00:31:50,712
Did you go outside?

784
00:31:50,713 --> 00:31:52,112
- To his workplace. - Oh, his workplace!

785
00:31:52,113 --> 00:31:53,812
And Young Taek even sang for her.

786
00:31:53,813 --> 00:31:55,213
That's incredible.

787
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:57,482
Was it an existing song or your own song?

788
00:31:57,483 --> 00:31:59,052
- My own song. - That's so cool.

789
00:31:59,053 --> 00:32:01,192
(They're talking about Young Taek and Joo Hee's date.)

790
00:32:01,193 --> 00:32:02,193
That's awesome.

791
00:32:02,194 --> 00:32:04,193
I should invite her and show her how I pull out teeth.

792
00:32:05,063 --> 00:32:06,093
Pull them out properly.

793
00:32:06,293 --> 00:32:07,792
Yes, show her your specialty.

794
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:09,763
- Pull them out properly. - Yes, show her.

795
00:32:10,233 --> 00:32:11,662
(Another announcement begins in the single zone.)

796
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:13,003
What's that?

797
00:32:13,403 --> 00:32:17,372
The potential proposal vote will begin now.

798
00:32:17,373 --> 00:32:18,842
- What's that about? - Already?

799
00:32:18,843 --> 00:32:22,643
In the potential proposal vote, you will vote for the person...

800
00:32:22,783 --> 00:32:25,982
you want to propose to on the last day of the program.

801
00:32:25,983 --> 00:32:27,183
It's too soon!

802
00:32:27,953 --> 00:32:29,683
You can pick...

803
00:32:29,883 --> 00:32:32,552
up to two people in the potential proposal vote.

804
00:32:32,553 --> 00:32:33,622
I'm so...

805
00:32:33,623 --> 00:32:34,892
(They have a lot to process before the vote.)

806
00:32:34,893 --> 00:32:38,293
If you're certain about one person as a future spouse,

807
00:32:38,793 --> 00:32:41,033
you may vote for one person only.

808
00:32:42,263 --> 00:32:45,303
If a man and a woman vote only for each other,

809
00:32:45,633 --> 00:32:48,873
the two will become a couple and move to the couple zone.

810
00:32:50,003 --> 00:32:52,973
But if you have no one you want to propose to,

811
00:32:53,543 --> 00:32:55,713
you may choose not to vote.

812
00:32:56,843 --> 00:32:59,182
It's a moment to confirm each other's feelings.

813
00:32:59,183 --> 00:33:00,613
I bet they're nervous.

814
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:02,382
Will they go for one person only...

815
00:33:02,383 --> 00:33:05,253
or show interest in both people?

816
00:33:05,553 --> 00:33:09,092
If we vote for two, we'll never go to the couple zone.

817
00:33:09,093 --> 00:33:10,123
That's true.

818
00:33:11,593 --> 00:33:15,463
Write the number and name of the potential proposal...

819
00:33:15,563 --> 00:33:17,163
on your profile card.

820
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:22,943
- Are you still torn? - Yes.

821
00:33:23,273 --> 00:33:24,702
Are you actually looking for a potential spouse?

822
00:33:24,703 --> 00:33:25,872
Yes.

823
00:33:25,873 --> 00:33:27,813
- Okay. - That's why I'm torn.

824
00:33:28,413 --> 00:33:29,582
It feels like the calm before the storm.

825
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:31,243
(It's the calm before the storm in the single zone.)

826
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:32,683
How are you feeling?

827
00:33:33,213 --> 00:33:37,522
I was torn between Number 7 and Number 24,

828
00:33:37,523 --> 00:33:39,993
- and the date happened. - Number 13 is also on your list?

829
00:33:40,323 --> 00:33:41,323
You said it was fun.

830
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:44,023
It was fun. But I'm considering marriage.

831
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:46,993
We're most curious about Joo Hee's choice.

832
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:49,533
What's the point of deliberating?

833
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:51,333
(Jae Yeon looks rather composed.)

834
00:33:51,334 --> 00:33:53,273
- He looks calm. - He does.

835
00:33:53,903 --> 00:33:56,672
It's not so difficult to pick two candidates.

836
00:33:56,673 --> 00:33:58,202
Choosing one between the two is the tough part.

837
00:33:58,203 --> 00:33:59,203
Exactly.

838
00:33:59,713 --> 00:34:00,942
Jin Ju must be torn between Sang Gyeong...

839
00:34:00,943 --> 00:34:01,943
- and Jae Keun, right? - Right.

840
00:34:01,944 --> 00:34:02,983
(Jin Ju can't decide between these two.)

841
00:34:04,483 --> 00:34:06,552
I should have made up my mind...

842
00:34:06,553 --> 00:34:09,053
to write this.

843
00:34:09,523 --> 00:34:11,053
Poor Joo Hee.

844
00:34:11,223 --> 00:34:13,122
Joo Hee must be the one...

845
00:34:13,123 --> 00:34:14,123
who wants to make up her mind.

846
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:17,293
How did they go to the couple zone?

847
00:34:18,293 --> 00:34:19,693
What were they so sure about?

848
00:34:20,763 --> 00:34:22,732
That's a similar question that unmarried people have...

849
00:34:22,733 --> 00:34:24,502
- about married people. - Right.

850
00:34:24,503 --> 00:34:26,233
"What were they so sure about to get married?"

851
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:27,573
Yes, I am curious about that.

852
00:34:28,203 --> 00:34:29,373
It's the moment of truth.

853
00:34:29,873 --> 00:34:31,903
(The given time ends.)

854
00:34:32,143 --> 00:34:35,542
Now, we will reveal the outcome...

855
00:34:35,543 --> 00:34:36,713
of the potential proposal vote.

856
00:34:37,113 --> 00:34:38,113
- What? - What?
You're revealing them already?

857
00:34:39,114 --> 00:34:41,853
When your name is called, go to the opposite sex's lounge...

858
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:44,653
and deliver your profile card...

859
00:34:44,853 --> 00:34:48,352
- to your choice directly. - Seriously?

860
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:49,863
We need to deliver it ourselves.

861
00:34:50,363 --> 00:34:52,723
If you decided not to vote...

862
00:34:53,093 --> 00:34:54,733
or weren't chosen,

863
00:34:55,133 --> 00:34:57,463
you must leave COUPLE PALACE.

864
00:34:58,403 --> 00:35:00,402
- No way. - Are you serious?

865
00:35:00,403 --> 00:35:01,433
We have to leave.

866
00:35:01,803 --> 00:35:04,143
You must leave COUPLE PALACE.

867
00:35:05,973 --> 00:35:07,773
I knew it.

868
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:10,482
- Oh, no! - Oh, my gosh.

869
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,582
- That's intense. - Some of them will leave tonight?

870
00:35:12,583 --> 00:35:14,253
(Who will leave for the first time from the single zone?)

871
00:35:15,353 --> 00:35:17,123
- I might be going home. - Same.

872
00:35:17,453 --> 00:35:19,353
It's so suffocating.

873
00:35:20,923 --> 00:35:24,323
Number Seven, Choi Jae Yeon, please deliver your card.

874
00:35:24,693 --> 00:35:26,022
- Jae Yeon. - Jae Yeon.

875
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:27,262
- Good luck. - Good luck.

876
00:35:27,263 --> 00:35:28,263
- You've got this. - Good luck.
(Jae Yeon departs with an anxious heart.)

877
00:35:30,863 --> 00:35:33,333
I assume he'll go straight to Joo Hee.

878
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:37,643
I don't like how vague this situation is.

879
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,542
(Jae Yeon only had eyes for one person,)

880
00:35:41,543 --> 00:35:44,643
(and Sang Gyeong felt bad for him.)

881
00:35:45,113 --> 00:35:47,712
We can't be sure yet. He might give up.

882
00:35:47,713 --> 00:35:50,023
He does seem a bit exhausted.

883
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:52,993
- Hello. - Hello.

884
00:35:54,623 --> 00:35:55,923
I'm so nervous.

885
00:35:56,563 --> 00:35:58,063
Don't tell me you gave up.

886
00:35:58,463 --> 00:35:59,463
Good luck.

887
00:36:01,133 --> 00:36:02,232
- Oh, my! - Thank you.

888
00:36:02,233 --> 00:36:03,863
I knew it. He's straightforward.

889
00:36:04,963 --> 00:36:07,533
After voting for her...

890
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:10,542
(What's his decision that shocked everyone?)

891
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:11,773
Oh, my gosh!

892
00:36:12,543 --> 00:36:13,572
- What? - Where is he going?

893
00:36:13,573 --> 00:36:14,573
Hang on.

894
00:36:14,743 --> 00:36:15,972
He must have another person.

895
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:17,813
(Does Jae Yeon have another interest?)

896
00:36:22,953 --> 00:36:24,753
I gave her the other card with a madeleine cake.

897
00:36:25,953 --> 00:36:28,453
I decided to go only for her,

898
00:36:28,623 --> 00:36:30,562
so I only chose Joo Hee.

899
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:31,763
He's so sweet.

900
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:33,433
- What? - Come on!

901
00:36:34,393 --> 00:36:36,093
Just give her all of them right away.

902
00:36:37,733 --> 00:36:40,873
I was so touched and thankful.

903
00:36:41,503 --> 00:36:42,903
He's so sweet.

904
00:36:43,003 --> 00:36:45,473
Jae Yeon is the best.

905
00:36:49,013 --> 00:36:51,882
Number 13, Kwon Young Taek, please deliver your card.

906
00:36:51,883 --> 00:36:53,412
- Young Taek! - Let's go!

907
00:36:53,413 --> 00:36:55,313
Here goes Young Taek.

908
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:56,753
I can't wait to find out who he chooses.

909
00:36:58,453 --> 00:36:59,583
No, he took two cards.

910
00:37:02,723 --> 00:37:04,862
He went on a date with Joo Hee today.

911
00:37:04,863 --> 00:37:05,863
Right.

912
00:37:06,963 --> 00:37:09,392
(Young Taek nervously came to the women's lounge.)

913
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:10,732
- You can do it. - You've got this.

914
00:37:10,733 --> 00:37:11,733
Let's find out.

915
00:37:11,734 --> 00:37:13,633
(Who is his potential proposal?)

916
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:16,372
I chose Number 18.

917
00:37:16,373 --> 00:37:18,443
(He chose Joo Hee.)

918
00:37:18,743 --> 00:37:20,473
I loved our little chat.

919
00:37:21,443 --> 00:37:24,543
I think he fell harder for her after the date.

920
00:37:26,213 --> 00:37:29,683
Number 18, Bae Joo Hee, please deliver your card.

921
00:37:29,923 --> 00:37:31,583
- Here goes Joo Hee. - She's next?

922
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,022
Bae Joo Hee, please deliver your card.

923
00:37:34,023 --> 00:37:35,023
Okay.

924
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,122
(The men's lounge is buzzing with the news...)

925
00:37:37,123 --> 00:37:38,362
(that Joo Hee's coming.)

926
00:37:38,363 --> 00:37:39,363
Let's see.

927
00:37:39,623 --> 00:37:41,133
This is so nerve-racking.

928
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:43,903
(Young Taek is also nervous.)

929
00:37:44,403 --> 00:37:46,572
I don't know why I'm so nervous.

930
00:37:46,573 --> 00:37:48,003
I know, right?

931
00:37:48,803 --> 00:37:49,803
Walk over with a smile.

932
00:37:49,873 --> 00:37:52,503
- Yes. - Good luck!

933
00:37:52,743 --> 00:37:54,043
Here she goes.

934
00:37:54,143 --> 00:37:55,143
She's on her way.

935
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:56,983
I kept contemplating.

936
00:37:58,413 --> 00:38:00,483
It's making me so confused.

937
00:38:01,253 --> 00:38:02,353
Number 24,

938
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:05,453
Number 13,

939
00:38:06,393 --> 00:38:07,393
and Number Seven.

940
00:38:08,423 --> 00:38:11,193
I don't think I can give the card with a light heart.

941
00:38:12,563 --> 00:38:13,633
Hello.

942
00:38:14,663 --> 00:38:17,362
She was chosen by Jae Yeon and Young Taek.

943
00:38:17,363 --> 00:38:18,363
Who will she choose?

944
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,873
(Who will Joo Hee choose?)

945
00:38:22,003 --> 00:38:23,543
I did see it coming.

946
00:38:23,643 --> 00:38:25,043
It didn't look like she'd choose me.

947
00:38:27,573 --> 00:38:29,243
I was hoping she'd pick me.

948
00:38:30,813 --> 00:38:32,883
I wished she'd pick me.

949
00:38:34,513 --> 00:38:37,782
(What is her choice?)

950
00:38:37,783 --> 00:38:41,593
(It was Jae Yeon.)

951
00:38:43,263 --> 00:38:44,822
Jae Yeon, good for you!

952
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:45,992
The straightforward guy succeeded.

953
00:38:45,993 --> 00:38:48,192
We still have to see if she's done.

954
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:49,692
- Didn't she give them all? - She might choose one more.

955
00:38:49,693 --> 00:38:50,862
- Wait for it! - Oh, you're right.

956
00:38:50,863 --> 00:38:51,903
Seriously?

957
00:38:53,403 --> 00:38:54,472
(She has another card in her hand.)

958
00:38:54,473 --> 00:38:56,472
- See? She's got one more. - She has one more card?

959
00:38:56,473 --> 00:38:58,003
(Is she going all-in for Jae Yeon, or will she choose one more man?)

960
00:38:58,103 --> 00:39:00,673
I was hoping she'd give it to me.

961
00:39:01,473 --> 00:39:03,343
Who? Young Taek? Sang Gyeong?

962
00:39:03,583 --> 00:39:06,483
(Who is her second pick?)

963
00:39:10,683 --> 00:39:12,352
(She chose Sang Gyeong.)

964
00:39:12,353 --> 00:39:14,193
- What? Seriously? - This means...

965
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:16,423
Did something happen between them?

966
00:39:17,123 --> 00:39:19,662
(Sang Gyeong and Joo Hee went on a marriage-focused date...)

967
00:39:19,663 --> 00:39:22,163
(on the first day of the Palace Week.)

968
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:27,903
(He found a little place in Joo Hee's heart that day.)

969
00:39:28,973 --> 00:39:30,273
Both of them are...

970
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:34,273
(She chose Jae Yeon and Sang Gyeong.)

971
00:39:34,943 --> 00:39:37,612
Jae Yeon must be so shocked.

972
00:39:37,613 --> 00:39:39,213
Sang Gyeong is also surprised.

973
00:39:40,013 --> 00:39:42,913
I honestly didn't expect her to choose me this time.

974
00:39:44,283 --> 00:39:48,053
Number 24, Lee Sang Gyeong, please deliver your card.

975
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,393
- Good luck. - Thanks.

976
00:39:50,723 --> 00:39:52,322
Here he goes.

977
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:54,263
(Who will he pick?)

978
00:39:54,733 --> 00:39:58,403
Number 24, Lee Sang Gyeong, please deliver your card.

979
00:40:01,133 --> 00:40:03,203
I had a feeling he'd only pick me.

980
00:40:03,303 --> 00:40:05,943
We had fun during today's date,

981
00:40:06,873 --> 00:40:08,473
and I hoped he'd choose me.

982
00:40:11,313 --> 00:40:14,683
I had some expectations after our chat yesterday.

983
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:19,282
(Who will he choose?)

984
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:20,293
Goodness.

985
00:40:21,923 --> 00:40:22,923
Hello.

986
00:40:25,863 --> 00:40:26,863
Hello.

987
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,492
(He goes straight to her as soon as he enters.)

988
00:40:28,493 --> 00:40:29,493
He doesn't hesitate.

989
00:40:31,603 --> 00:40:34,232
- He chose her right away. - No way!

990
00:40:34,233 --> 00:40:35,833
(He chose Jin Ju without hesitation.)

991
00:40:36,273 --> 00:40:38,143
I was so glad.

992
00:40:42,043 --> 00:40:44,182
(But he has another card left.)

993
00:40:44,183 --> 00:40:46,413
It wasn't over yet, so I waited.

994
00:40:52,323 --> 00:40:54,553
Thank you.

995
00:40:57,523 --> 00:40:58,523
- What? - No way!

996
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:00,432
What?

997
00:41:00,433 --> 00:41:03,732
(He only chose Jin Ju.)

998
00:41:03,733 --> 00:41:04,803
That's cool.

999
00:41:05,203 --> 00:41:08,403
I was confused, thinking, "Why am I swaying?"

1000
00:41:10,673 --> 00:41:12,202
I thought it was wise to pick one person only,

1001
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:13,742
so I voted for Jin Ju.

1002
00:41:13,743 --> 00:41:14,973
I wanted to go to the couple zone.

1003
00:41:16,513 --> 00:41:19,012
He wanted to go to the couple zone with Jin Ju.

1004
00:41:19,013 --> 00:41:20,053
Right.

1005
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:21,483
- Did you only write one name? - Yes.

1006
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:24,623
- He's made up his mind, then. - He has.

1007
00:41:24,823 --> 00:41:26,183
- That's cool. - You're so cool.

1008
00:41:26,583 --> 00:41:27,593
What a man.

1009
00:41:28,723 --> 00:41:30,862
- Number Three, Hwang Jae Keun, - Go on.

1010
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,122
please deliver your card.

1011
00:41:32,123 --> 00:41:33,222
(Number 3, Hwang Jae Keun)

1012
00:41:33,223 --> 00:41:34,233
I'll be back.

1013
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:37,132
(Female residents waiting for Jae Keun's decision)

1014
00:41:37,133 --> 00:41:38,163
Oh, my gosh.

1015
00:41:38,503 --> 00:41:40,173
I wonder who he'll pick.

1016
00:41:44,503 --> 00:41:46,572
I believe marriage is a long-term game.

1017
00:41:46,573 --> 00:41:49,573
Marriage with Jin Ju seems stable.

1018
00:41:50,313 --> 00:41:52,913
Marriage with Hye Won seems passionate.

1019
00:41:53,453 --> 00:41:54,983
I thought really hard about this.

1020
00:41:57,553 --> 00:41:59,183
- Welcome. - Hi.

1021
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,423
I believe in destiny.

1022
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:04,963
I believe he'll pick me again.

1023
00:42:09,033 --> 00:42:10,432
(What's his choice...)

1024
00:42:10,433 --> 00:42:11,762
- Jae Keun. - Let's find out.

1025
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:12,903
(between stability and passion?)

1026
00:42:15,303 --> 00:42:16,303
- Who is it? - Who?

1027
00:42:16,304 --> 00:42:17,343
What?

1028
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:18,942
(Jae Keun chose Jin Ju.)

1029
00:42:18,943 --> 00:42:19,973
- It was Jin Ju. - Jin Ju.

1030
00:42:21,643 --> 00:42:23,742
He has one more card. Is it for Hye Won?

1031
00:42:23,743 --> 00:42:25,583
(He still has one more card left.)

1032
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:31,053
- What? - Is he leaving?

1033
00:42:31,353 --> 00:42:32,423
What's going on?

1034
00:42:33,283 --> 00:42:35,493
(His only choice was Jin Ju.)

1035
00:42:38,023 --> 00:42:39,193
- What? - Nothing.

1036
00:42:45,333 --> 00:42:48,533
I thought he'd pick two, but he only gave one to her.

1037
00:42:48,873 --> 00:42:50,543
What happens next?

1038
00:42:52,243 --> 00:42:54,743
He constantly said that he liked me at first.

1039
00:42:55,213 --> 00:42:57,143
I had never experienced this before.

1040
00:42:59,013 --> 00:43:00,883
I thought, "This must be what it feels like to get dumped."

1041
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:05,052
I never imagined he'd only pick Jin Ju.

1042
00:43:05,053 --> 00:43:07,393
- I thought... - Are you sure, Jae Keun?

1043
00:43:07,593 --> 00:43:09,922
Has he decided on going all in...

1044
00:43:09,923 --> 00:43:11,823
for Jin Ju?

1045
00:43:12,763 --> 00:43:14,833
(What was on his mind?)

1046
00:43:15,663 --> 00:43:18,202
I talked so much with Jin Ju.

1047
00:43:18,203 --> 00:43:19,233
I see.

1048
00:43:19,963 --> 00:43:22,702
I had a feeling that she was...

1049
00:43:22,703 --> 00:43:24,943
into me at the moment.

1050
00:43:26,543 --> 00:43:29,313
- People have preferences. - Right.

1051
00:43:31,713 --> 00:43:33,483
You're my preference.

1052
00:43:34,913 --> 00:43:36,052
Was I too honest?

1053
00:43:36,053 --> 00:43:37,552
- That was straightforward. - Yes.

1054
00:43:37,553 --> 00:43:39,023
- So... - I like it.

1055
00:43:39,423 --> 00:43:43,022
If I'm being honest, I wish I could date you...

1056
00:43:43,023 --> 00:43:44,362
for one more month.

1057
00:43:44,363 --> 00:43:45,363
Right.

1058
00:43:45,364 --> 00:43:47,362
- Doing simple things, you know. - Having coffee...

1059
00:43:47,363 --> 00:43:48,432
Yes, like having coffee.

1060
00:43:48,433 --> 00:43:50,033
And eat dinner together.

1061
00:43:50,103 --> 00:43:51,962
- With a few light drinks. - But...

1062
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:53,432
I can picture it.

1063
00:43:53,433 --> 00:43:55,272
(I can picture it.)

1064
00:43:55,273 --> 00:43:58,602
How come I can picture it?

1065
00:43:58,603 --> 00:43:59,673
I just can.

1066
00:44:00,313 --> 00:44:03,173
(Jin Ju proactively expressed her interest.)

1067
00:44:03,683 --> 00:44:06,113
That gave me conviction,

1068
00:44:06,513 --> 00:44:08,012
so I went all in for her.

1069
00:44:08,013 --> 00:44:09,083
- I see. - I did.

1070
00:44:09,553 --> 00:44:10,922
I'm so curious about Number 19,

1071
00:44:10,923 --> 00:44:13,492
and it's true that I'm drawn to her.

1072
00:44:13,493 --> 00:44:15,152
- She's attractive. - She's so attractive.

1073
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:16,323
She really is.

1074
00:44:16,893 --> 00:44:18,922
But I wasn't sure...

1075
00:44:18,923 --> 00:44:21,862
if she was ready to consider marriage.

1076
00:44:21,863 --> 00:44:23,193
- I see. - It all came down to that.

1077
00:44:23,933 --> 00:44:27,702
I think I was more compatible with Jin Ju in that perspective.

1078
00:44:27,703 --> 00:44:28,732
I see.

1079
00:44:28,733 --> 00:44:30,473
She seemed ready to get married.

1080
00:44:31,573 --> 00:44:34,313
I decided to go all in for Jin Ju.

1081
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:37,912
I can totally relate to him.

1082
00:44:37,913 --> 00:44:40,352
There are men who go straight for one woman from the get-go,

1083
00:44:40,353 --> 00:44:41,982
but there are also men...

1084
00:44:41,983 --> 00:44:44,422
who go all in once you give them certainty.

1085
00:44:44,423 --> 00:44:46,282
This isn't just dating, you know.

1086
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:47,553
They're looking to get married.

1087
00:44:48,553 --> 00:44:50,993
Number 23, Seo Jin Ju.

1088
00:44:51,363 --> 00:44:52,792
(Jin Ju's name is finally called.)

1089
00:44:52,793 --> 00:44:54,633
I was swayed hard.

1090
00:44:55,363 --> 00:44:57,903
Two men picked me exclusively,

1091
00:44:58,033 --> 00:44:59,903
and I thought, "What am I going to do?"

1092
00:45:00,303 --> 00:45:02,773
Seo Jin Ju, please deliver your card.

1093
00:45:03,303 --> 00:45:04,743
I'll be back.

1094
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,973
- Good luck. - This is a lot of pressure.

1095
00:45:08,273 --> 00:45:09,373
I'll be back.

1096
00:45:10,213 --> 00:45:12,942
I think Jin Ju is into Sang Gyeong.

1097
00:45:12,943 --> 00:45:13,983
Go to the couple zone.

1098
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:17,453
Sang Gyeong and Jae Keun went all in for Jin Ju.

1099
00:45:17,583 --> 00:45:19,282
Her choice will determine it.

1100
00:45:19,283 --> 00:45:20,653
(Where is her heart headed?)

1101
00:45:20,953 --> 00:45:23,353
There might be a surprise, though.

1102
00:45:24,123 --> 00:45:27,693
No, this may be bigger than we think.

1103
00:45:28,363 --> 00:45:31,962
Jin Ju's decision is crucial.

1104
00:45:31,963 --> 00:45:33,003
It is.

1105
00:45:33,133 --> 00:45:35,373
I don't want to regret my decision.

1106
00:45:36,943 --> 00:45:39,903
(Two men await her decision.)

1107
00:45:41,173 --> 00:45:42,473
I'm sorry.

1108
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,212
She's sorry?

1109
00:45:44,213 --> 00:45:46,343
(Who is she apologizing to?)

1110
00:45:48,453 --> 00:45:50,183
(She hands over the card to Sang Gyeong.)

1111
00:45:51,223 --> 00:45:52,683
She gave it to Sang Gyeong.

1112
00:45:53,453 --> 00:45:56,193
I thought that I expressed my interest enough.

1113
00:46:03,863 --> 00:46:07,833
(She gives Jae Keun her second card.)

1114
00:46:10,643 --> 00:46:12,203
I was so flustered.

1115
00:46:12,643 --> 00:46:15,512
I thought, "Maybe I didn't give her enough trust."

1116
00:46:15,513 --> 00:46:17,413
Of course, I'm offended.

1117
00:46:19,313 --> 00:46:20,383
I'm running away.

1118
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,423
The men went all in for her, and...

1119
00:46:24,683 --> 00:46:28,193
Pouring 100 percent of your feelings only to get 50 percent back...

1120
00:46:28,353 --> 00:46:29,392
- would upset you so much. - Definitely.

1121
00:46:29,393 --> 00:46:31,222
- Naturally. - They chose her only.

1122
00:46:31,223 --> 00:46:32,263
- Right. - Yes.

1123
00:46:33,163 --> 00:46:34,962
The two had such different charms,

1124
00:46:34,963 --> 00:46:38,463
so it was tough to pick only one person.

1125
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:40,432
I thought, "Am I the only one...

1126
00:46:40,433 --> 00:46:43,273
who's taking it too seriously as if the wedding is tomorrow?"

1127
00:46:43,573 --> 00:46:45,203
That's what I thought.

1128
00:46:45,403 --> 00:46:46,473
What should I do?

1129
00:46:49,013 --> 00:46:52,543
Number Eight, Lee Yoon Seo, please deliver your card.

1130
00:46:52,983 --> 00:46:53,983
Me?

1131
00:46:53,984 --> 00:46:55,082
- Goodness. - Thank you.

1132
00:46:55,083 --> 00:46:56,383
- He gave one to Hye Won. - Good for her.

1133
00:46:57,223 --> 00:46:58,223
Oh, my.

1134
00:46:58,623 --> 00:47:02,293
Number Eight gave me a card, so I was grateful.

1135
00:47:03,553 --> 00:47:05,792
She won't have to leave now.

1136
00:47:05,793 --> 00:47:07,193
But I wonder who she will pick.

1137
00:47:08,263 --> 00:47:12,233
Number 26, Lee Jung Won, please deliver your card.

1138
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:16,232
Jung Won is also interested in two women at the moment.

1139
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:17,603
(Has he made up his mind?)

1140
00:47:18,373 --> 00:47:21,073
(The conversation between Jung Won and Sin Da on Day 2)

1141
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:23,143
(He honestly told her about his worries.)

1142
00:47:23,543 --> 00:47:25,613
I'm not sure about how I feel.

1143
00:47:25,783 --> 00:47:28,913
(The woman who made him so uncertain)

1144
00:47:29,113 --> 00:47:32,853
(Seung Yeon came in between Sin Da and Jung Won.)

1145
00:47:34,623 --> 00:47:36,693
Will it be Sin Da or Seung Yeon?

1146
00:47:40,833 --> 00:47:44,603
I get that he's not certain about marriage.

1147
00:47:44,863 --> 00:47:48,572
But if he's not even certain about who his favorite is,

1148
00:47:48,573 --> 00:47:52,773
I no longer want to waste my time in this situation.

1149
00:47:54,143 --> 00:47:57,343
Who will get Jung Won's card?

1150
00:48:00,113 --> 00:48:01,653
(He gave Sin Da his card.)

1151
00:48:02,153 --> 00:48:03,723
- Oh, my! - Look at Sin Da.

1152
00:48:03,953 --> 00:48:05,853
- She's so cute. - She's so happy.

1153
00:48:07,353 --> 00:48:10,222
(He turns away and leaves right after.)

1154
00:48:10,223 --> 00:48:12,062
He's going all in for Sin Da.

1155
00:48:12,063 --> 00:48:13,522
(He only chose Sin Da.)

1156
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:16,263
He came to me with a cute look...

1157
00:48:16,563 --> 00:48:18,703
and shyly gave me two cards.

1158
00:48:19,463 --> 00:48:20,903
I was exhilarated.

1159
00:48:21,403 --> 00:48:22,503
You look so happy!

1160
00:48:22,603 --> 00:48:23,603
So cute.

1161
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:26,903
Is it done?

1162
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,812
She has to give her card to him as well.

1163
00:48:28,813 --> 00:48:29,843
Oh, right.

1164
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:31,642
If she only chooses Jung Won,

1165
00:48:31,643 --> 00:48:33,382
- they're going to the couple zone. - Yes.

1166
00:48:33,383 --> 00:48:34,983
(Number 9, Oh Sin Da, is here to deliver her card.)

1167
00:48:35,453 --> 00:48:37,553
I've been sulky all day.

1168
00:48:38,383 --> 00:48:40,322
Part of me was angry,

1169
00:48:40,323 --> 00:48:42,292
I had severe mood swings,

1170
00:48:42,293 --> 00:48:44,422
and I was stressed out.

1171
00:48:44,423 --> 00:48:45,823
I was pretty exhausted.

1172
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:49,662
But it was all worth it. I forgot all about it.

1173
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:51,703
I only have good memories now,

1174
00:48:51,863 --> 00:48:53,533
so...

1175
00:48:58,973 --> 00:49:00,543
I ran up to him.

1176
00:49:01,213 --> 00:49:02,843
- Go on. - Here she comes.

1177
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:04,843
I gave them like this.

1178
00:49:05,643 --> 00:49:07,043
I gave him both my cards.

1179
00:49:11,483 --> 00:49:14,022
(Sin Da is also going all in for Jung Won.)

1180
00:49:14,023 --> 00:49:15,492
Both her cards.

1181
00:49:15,493 --> 00:49:16,692
(They're going to the couple zone!)

1182
00:49:16,693 --> 00:49:18,092
Jung Won and Sin Da are going to the couple zone!

1183
00:49:18,093 --> 00:49:19,463
They've been matched now.

1184
00:49:21,633 --> 00:49:23,533
He made me feel certain.

1185
00:49:24,633 --> 00:49:26,263
She looks so down all of a sudden.

1186
00:49:26,833 --> 00:49:28,672
- Who? - Sin Da.

1187
00:49:28,673 --> 00:49:29,703
Really?

1188
00:49:30,103 --> 00:49:32,703
Sin Da looked sad,

1189
00:49:33,273 --> 00:49:35,342
and it made me worried.

1190
00:49:35,343 --> 00:49:37,072
(He lingered around her because he was worried.)

1191
00:49:37,073 --> 00:49:40,283
I tried to make her feel better.

1192
00:49:41,283 --> 00:49:43,183
- Are you going to eat? - I'm not sure.

1193
00:49:43,553 --> 00:49:45,822
- I don't have an appetite. - I know.

1194
00:49:45,823 --> 00:49:46,953
(He subtly looked after her.)

1195
00:49:47,153 --> 00:49:48,323
Don't you have a jacket?

1196
00:49:49,723 --> 00:49:50,823
I do,

1197
00:49:51,793 --> 00:49:53,363
but this dress looks better without it.

1198
00:49:53,893 --> 00:49:56,662
(He always smiled when he heard her whimsical remarks.)

1199
00:49:56,663 --> 00:49:58,932
It doesn't sound so bad to stick with someone...

1200
00:49:58,933 --> 00:50:00,363
that you're into.

1201
00:50:00,873 --> 00:50:02,573
I like having you next to me.

1202
00:50:03,973 --> 00:50:05,403
- Having me? - Yes.

1203
00:50:07,073 --> 00:50:11,343
She's very straightforward with her expressions,

1204
00:50:12,213 --> 00:50:13,283
so I decided...

1205
00:50:14,113 --> 00:50:16,483
to choose her.

1206
00:50:18,683 --> 00:50:19,853
I feel certain now.

1207
00:50:21,423 --> 00:50:23,493
What? What's going on between them?

1208
00:50:24,463 --> 00:50:26,063
That was pretty sweet.

1209
00:50:27,193 --> 00:50:28,963
You look so happy in situations like this.

1210
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:31,503
- Earlier... - I'm so transparent.

1211
00:50:33,503 --> 00:50:37,502
Lee Jung Won and Oh Sin Da only chose each other,

1212
00:50:37,503 --> 00:50:39,473
so they will go to the couple zone.

1213
00:50:40,513 --> 00:50:41,513
Congratulations!

1214
00:50:41,514 --> 00:50:43,373
(Everyone's congratulating them.)

1215
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:45,882
(But there's one person who can't.)

1216
00:50:45,883 --> 00:50:48,282
- You make such a cute couple. - Congrats.

1217
00:50:48,283 --> 00:50:49,413
Thank you.

1218
00:50:50,413 --> 00:50:52,183
I guess there really is a match for everyone.

1219
00:50:53,853 --> 00:50:57,523
Number 21, Oh Seung Yeon, please deliver your card.

1220
00:50:58,023 --> 00:50:59,063
It's Seung Yeon's turn.

1221
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:01,863
Oh, no. She has to choose.

1222
00:51:02,193 --> 00:51:03,233
Let's go.

1223
00:51:07,633 --> 00:51:09,432
She and Jung Won gave off...

1224
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:11,772
pretty good vibes until the afternoon.

1225
00:51:11,773 --> 00:51:12,773
Right.

1226
00:51:16,743 --> 00:51:18,943
(Who will she choose?)

1227
00:51:25,653 --> 00:51:26,653
No way.

1228
00:51:26,654 --> 00:51:27,753
(She gave it to Jung Won.)

1229
00:51:29,993 --> 00:51:32,593
Seung Yeon chose Jung Won.

1230
00:51:34,993 --> 00:51:36,532
(She chose Jung Won, who's going to the couple zone with Sin Da.)

1231
00:51:36,533 --> 00:51:38,832
How is Jung Won going to react? He just became a couple.

1232
00:51:38,833 --> 00:51:40,573
- What's wrong? - It's nothing.

1233
00:51:41,203 --> 00:51:43,333
What's happening to your mouth?

1234
00:51:44,703 --> 00:51:46,673
Seung Yeon had written my name.

1235
00:51:47,743 --> 00:51:49,073
It was a shocker.

1236
00:51:51,583 --> 00:51:55,452
These are the male and female moving to the couple zone.

1237
00:51:55,453 --> 00:51:57,622
- Lee Jung Won and Oh Sin Da. - Bye.

1238
00:51:57,623 --> 00:51:58,852
(Lee Jung Won and Oh Sin Da)

1239
00:51:58,853 --> 00:52:00,992
Min Dong Sung and Kim Ja Hyun.

1240
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:02,953
(Min Dong Sung and Kim Ja Hyun)

1241
00:52:03,323 --> 00:52:05,792
My Ja Hyun is here. Ja Hyun.

1242
00:52:05,793 --> 00:52:10,863
(They gave one vote for each other and entered the couple zone.)

1243
00:52:11,363 --> 00:52:12,432
Shall we go?

1244
00:52:12,433 --> 00:52:13,932
(A lovely couple with similar looks is born.)

1245
00:52:13,933 --> 00:52:15,673
The two look great together.

1246
00:52:18,973 --> 00:52:19,973
My gosh.

1247
00:52:19,974 --> 00:52:22,213
I stuck my name in the center like you.

1248
00:52:23,643 --> 00:52:24,683
I see.

1249
00:52:24,883 --> 00:52:27,683
(The two happily head to the couple zone.)

1250
00:52:28,413 --> 00:52:29,783
I'm freezing.

1251
00:52:31,323 --> 00:52:32,682
(Jung Won takes his jacket off right away.)

1252
00:52:32,683 --> 00:52:34,423
Thank you.

1253
00:52:34,623 --> 00:52:35,953
What a lovely sight.

1254
00:52:37,023 --> 00:52:38,763
(The two couples arrive at the couple zone.)

1255
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,062
(The couple zone has a slightly different vibe.)

1256
00:52:44,063 --> 00:52:45,102
- What? - My gosh.

1257
00:52:45,103 --> 00:52:47,132
- We also got whisky. - You're right.

1258
00:52:47,133 --> 00:52:49,303
- We're finally... - Finally.

1259
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,342
The couple zone is having a party.

1260
00:52:51,343 --> 00:52:52,403
Great work.

1261
00:52:52,703 --> 00:52:54,413
- "Great work?" - What's with that?

1262
00:52:54,613 --> 00:52:55,743
Cheers.

1263
00:52:56,043 --> 00:52:57,212
He said great work.

1264
00:52:57,213 --> 00:52:58,213
(A peaceful and loving air continues.)

1265
00:52:58,214 --> 00:52:59,243
Right?

1266
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:02,612
(Hyun Joong and Si Yeon are sitting side by side.)

1267
00:53:02,613 --> 00:53:04,522
Isn't it really dry here?

1268
00:53:04,523 --> 00:53:06,753
- The heater is blasting in here. - Do you want some?

1269
00:53:07,793 --> 00:53:08,823
Can I?

1270
00:53:10,093 --> 00:53:14,392
(Hyun Joong and Si Yeon are in their own little world.)

1271
00:53:14,393 --> 00:53:16,633
It's literally a couple zone with real romance.

1272
00:53:17,093 --> 00:53:18,862
(The couples share stories,)

1273
00:53:18,863 --> 00:53:21,333
(and the mood is warming up.)

1274
00:53:21,533 --> 00:53:22,602
(Nobody wants to be apart.)

1275
00:53:22,603 --> 00:53:25,143
Ji Woong and Ha Yeon are too close to each other.

1276
00:53:26,973 --> 00:53:29,313
(At that moment, the door opens and somebody comes in.)

1277
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:31,243
- What? - My gosh.

1278
00:53:32,143 --> 00:53:33,682
- Goodness. - What?

1279
00:53:33,683 --> 00:53:35,652
(Sin Da and Jung Won have come to the couple zone.)

1280
00:53:35,653 --> 00:53:36,753
Hi.

1281
00:53:36,953 --> 00:53:38,623
(As well as Dong Sung and Ja Hyun.)

1282
00:53:39,953 --> 00:53:42,292
Everyone. Get up and clap for us!

1283
00:53:42,293 --> 00:53:44,893
(Everyone seems happy for the new couples...)

1284
00:53:45,793 --> 00:53:46,823
For real?

1285
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:49,863
Gosh. They're here?

1286
00:53:50,803 --> 00:53:52,763
(Ji Woong is interested in Sin Da and she's finally here.)

1287
00:53:53,603 --> 00:53:54,703
I was quite surprised.

1288
00:53:55,933 --> 00:53:57,372
Sin Da kept...

1289
00:53:57,373 --> 00:54:00,102
expressing her feelings to me.

1290
00:54:00,103 --> 00:54:02,442
Little did I expect her to become a couple...

1291
00:54:02,443 --> 00:54:03,613
and join us so quickly.

1292
00:54:04,283 --> 00:54:06,042
He looks quite shocked...

1293
00:54:06,043 --> 00:54:08,413
at Sin Da's appearance.

1294
00:54:09,013 --> 00:54:10,612
(Jung Won, Sin Da, Ji Woong, and Ha Yeon...)

1295
00:54:10,613 --> 00:54:12,822
(are sitting side by side.)

1296
00:54:12,823 --> 00:54:14,323
Hi.

1297
00:54:15,093 --> 00:54:16,392
- My roommate. - We're roommates.

1298
00:54:16,393 --> 00:54:17,463
I've heard.

1299
00:54:19,093 --> 00:54:20,993
Ha Yeon knows that Ji Woong...

1300
00:54:21,093 --> 00:54:23,663
- has feelings for Sin Da. - Exactly.

1301
00:54:25,063 --> 00:54:27,003
(Jung Won leaves for a while.)

1302
00:54:28,273 --> 00:54:30,272
(Even Ji Woong leaves.)

1303
00:54:30,273 --> 00:54:33,372
- Our schedule was too tight. - What happened?

1304
00:54:33,373 --> 00:54:35,672
In the morning, we had breakfast...

1305
00:54:35,673 --> 00:54:37,173
with my older brother.

1306
00:54:37,683 --> 00:54:38,943
Going outside was really nice.

1307
00:54:39,413 --> 00:54:41,953
We took a car and went on a little drive.

1308
00:54:42,583 --> 00:54:44,053
Her face is like, "So what?"

1309
00:54:45,183 --> 00:54:46,552
(Ji Woong returns...)

1310
00:54:46,553 --> 00:54:48,122
(and sits next to Sin Da.)

1311
00:54:48,123 --> 00:54:51,222
You shouldn't do that. That's not your seat, Ji Woong.

1312
00:54:51,223 --> 00:54:52,323
How can you sit there?

1313
00:54:52,863 --> 00:54:53,922
Why are you sitting there?

1314
00:54:53,923 --> 00:54:55,463
Go sit next to her now.

1315
00:54:56,393 --> 00:54:57,532
She's scary.

1316
00:54:57,533 --> 00:54:59,633
(Ji Woong finally returns to his seat.)

1317
00:55:00,233 --> 00:55:02,473
I'm sure Ha Yeon isn't happy about it at all.

1318
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:05,502
What was it like at the single zone yesterday?

1319
00:55:05,503 --> 00:55:06,573
He liked it.

1320
00:55:06,743 --> 00:55:09,142
- How honest of him. - Who called you over?

1321
00:55:09,143 --> 00:55:12,382
- The one from the interview. - The tall Miss Korea...

1322
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:14,852
took him, saying he was hers,

1323
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:16,812
and talked with him.

1324
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,453
She took him to the room with the bed.

1325
00:55:20,253 --> 00:55:23,123
(Ji Woong was invited to the single zone party.)

1326
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:24,962
Yes, to the room with the bed.

1327
00:55:24,963 --> 00:55:27,592
I also wanted to talk to him,

1328
00:55:27,593 --> 00:55:29,692
- so I went to the room. - We talked a lot more.

1329
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:31,662
- That's not true. - No, we did.

1330
00:55:31,663 --> 00:55:32,932
No way.

1331
00:55:32,933 --> 00:55:35,272
I gave you two enough time to talk.

1332
00:55:35,273 --> 00:55:37,572
The Miss Korea...

1333
00:55:37,573 --> 00:55:39,342
I'm hearing a lot for the first time.

1334
00:55:39,343 --> 00:55:41,842
When Ji Woong left, he said, "I'll be right back."

1335
00:55:41,843 --> 00:55:43,373
The interview went on for a while.

1336
00:55:44,143 --> 00:55:45,243
Interview?

1337
00:55:47,083 --> 00:55:48,352
Looks like you had plenty to say.

1338
00:55:48,353 --> 00:55:49,413
(There's a weird vibe between the two.)

1339
00:55:53,423 --> 00:55:56,452
We're here for that very purpose.

1340
00:55:56,453 --> 00:55:58,563
- You're in the couple zone. - Not in the couple zone.

1341
00:55:59,393 --> 00:56:03,033
Thinking the situation could change at any time...

1342
00:56:03,163 --> 00:56:04,933
made me a little worried.

1343
00:56:05,463 --> 00:56:08,503
Gosh, this is bad.

1344
00:56:09,303 --> 00:56:12,503
(Meanwhile, in the single zone)

1345
00:56:13,173 --> 00:56:15,143
- Did you receive two votes? - Yes.

1346
00:56:15,273 --> 00:56:18,112
- Who? - Numbers 7 and 13.

1347
00:56:18,113 --> 00:56:20,342
(Joo Hee received votes from Choi Jae Yeon and Kwon Young Taek.)

1348
00:56:20,343 --> 00:56:22,852
And I voted for Numbers 7 and 24.

1349
00:56:22,853 --> 00:56:24,012
(Joo Hee voted for Choi Jae Yeon and Lee Sang Gyeong.)

1350
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:25,253
What a surprise.

1351
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:28,323
Great choice.

1352
00:56:28,493 --> 00:56:31,493
I think it's a good idea to get to know everyone.

1353
00:56:32,363 --> 00:56:33,993
- I couldn't. - It's not everyone.

1354
00:56:34,463 --> 00:56:35,533
That...

1355
00:56:35,833 --> 00:56:37,062
It's not everyone.

1356
00:56:37,063 --> 00:56:40,302
I was only interested in Numbers 7 and 24.

1357
00:56:40,303 --> 00:56:42,632
So you also voted for Number 24.

1358
00:56:42,633 --> 00:56:45,202
- I kept voting for Number 24. - You did?

1359
00:56:45,203 --> 00:56:48,313
- I had no idea. - It was only these two for me.

1360
00:56:48,413 --> 00:56:49,912
As we expected,

1361
00:56:49,913 --> 00:56:51,542
the single zone is experiencing difficulties.

1362
00:56:51,543 --> 00:56:53,112
- What now? - It's tangled up...

1363
00:56:53,113 --> 00:56:54,353
and a total mess.

1364
00:56:54,553 --> 00:56:57,212
Jae Yeon is all about Joo Hee.

1365
00:56:57,213 --> 00:57:00,383
Meanwhile, Joo Hee has voted for Jae Yeon and Sang Gyeong.

1366
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:03,322
Sang Gyeong and Jae Keun are all about Jin Ju.

1367
00:57:03,323 --> 00:57:05,592
And Jin Ju has voted for both Sang Gyeong...

1368
00:57:05,593 --> 00:57:07,192
and Jae Keun.

1369
00:57:07,193 --> 00:57:09,793
Jin Ju is practically the winner here.

1370
00:57:10,263 --> 00:57:12,362
Whichever decision I make,

1371
00:57:12,363 --> 00:57:14,003
it's going to be a mess.

1372
00:57:14,433 --> 00:57:17,003
If I choose Number 23, then I'm competing against Jae Keun.

1373
00:57:17,103 --> 00:57:19,343
If I choose 18, then I'm competing against Jae Yeon.

1374
00:57:19,643 --> 00:57:21,143
- I'm losing it. - How interesting.

1375
00:57:22,113 --> 00:57:24,983
(The females are also in a complicated situation.)

1376
00:57:25,513 --> 00:57:28,082
What now, Joo Hee? You're debating, aren't you?

1377
00:57:28,083 --> 00:57:29,312
Me? I'm going nuts.

1378
00:57:29,313 --> 00:57:31,582
Same here. What do I do?

1379
00:57:31,583 --> 00:57:32,952
Are you deciding between two males?

1380
00:57:32,953 --> 00:57:34,692
- Yes, two. - Who and who?

1381
00:57:34,693 --> 00:57:37,352
- Number 24 and... - Numbers 24 and 3.

1382
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:39,322
Number Three is the type...

1383
00:57:39,323 --> 00:57:41,962
I had fun with when I dated someone like him.

1384
00:57:41,963 --> 00:57:43,132
- He's like that. - Okay.

1385
00:57:43,133 --> 00:57:44,562
Honestly, Number 24...

1386
00:57:44,563 --> 00:57:47,672
isn't a type I have dated before.

1387
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:49,533
- He isn't? - No.

1388
00:57:49,733 --> 00:57:52,142
- But he feels like a husband. - Really?

1389
00:57:52,143 --> 00:57:53,402
I'm the complete opposite.

1390
00:57:53,403 --> 00:57:55,073
- For real? - Number Seven is like a husband.

1391
00:57:55,543 --> 00:57:58,412
- And Number 24... - Right.

1392
00:57:58,413 --> 00:58:00,542
- is like the other guy. - I get it.

1393
00:58:00,543 --> 00:58:02,382
- This is so interesting. - We're alike...

1394
00:58:02,383 --> 00:58:04,013
- but in opposite situations. - Exactly.

1395
00:58:04,623 --> 00:58:08,353
We have the opposite opinion of the same person.

1396
00:58:08,693 --> 00:58:09,752
Maybe I'm being hated.

1397
00:58:09,753 --> 00:58:11,822
- Why? - Like, "Why hasn't she chosen yet?"

1398
00:58:11,823 --> 00:58:14,392
I had the same thought. What if they call me a fox?

1399
00:58:14,393 --> 00:58:15,462
"She's sly as a fox."

1400
00:58:15,463 --> 00:58:18,502
- And playing the field. - "She's playing the field."

1401
00:58:18,503 --> 00:58:19,662
What if they think like that?

1402
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:21,133
Everyone does.

1403
00:58:22,433 --> 00:58:23,772
But we understand.

1404
00:58:23,773 --> 00:58:25,972
- It's only day two. - Yes, we understand.

1405
00:58:25,973 --> 00:58:27,042
We totally understand.

1406
00:58:27,043 --> 00:58:29,743
We understand why you're worried.

1407
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:32,082
To be honest, when that crossed my mind,

1408
00:58:32,083 --> 00:58:33,213
I also thought,

1409
00:58:33,313 --> 00:58:35,612
"How can you choose someone...

1410
00:58:35,613 --> 00:58:37,383
when it's only been a few days?"

1411
00:58:37,453 --> 00:58:39,982
- "Is this for real?" - My plan...

1412
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:42,722
was to become a couple, get married,

1413
00:58:42,723 --> 00:58:44,222
and leave smoothly.

1414
00:58:44,223 --> 00:58:45,822
Really? Same here.

1415
00:58:45,823 --> 00:58:47,192
I wanted to get married right after the show.

1416
00:58:47,193 --> 00:58:49,392
I had such determination...

1417
00:58:49,393 --> 00:58:50,963
before coming here.

1418
00:58:52,103 --> 00:58:53,802
I want to get married right now.

1419
00:58:53,803 --> 00:58:57,303
Those two are sincere.

1420
00:58:57,603 --> 00:58:59,003
That makes it more difficult.

1421
00:58:59,273 --> 00:59:00,972
(COUPLE PALACE is in chaos.)

1422
00:59:00,973 --> 00:59:02,512
(The single zone's party has started.)

1423
00:59:02,513 --> 00:59:04,983
Something surely happens when there's a party.

1424
00:59:07,083 --> 00:59:08,213
The alcohol tastes bitter today.

1425
00:59:10,783 --> 00:59:12,123
You had a hard day.

1426
00:59:12,553 --> 00:59:13,553
Thank you.

1427
00:59:13,554 --> 00:59:15,853
In the midst of it all, he's worried about Joo Hee.

1428
00:59:16,393 --> 00:59:18,223
- There's no water. - Should I get some?

1429
00:59:18,363 --> 00:59:19,862
I'll bring a bucket full of it.

1430
00:59:19,863 --> 00:59:21,833
- Do we have water? - No.

1431
00:59:22,993 --> 00:59:24,603
How about downstairs?

1432
00:59:24,903 --> 00:59:27,163
Joo Hee goes after Jae Yeon.

1433
00:59:28,173 --> 00:59:29,673
Could I have some water?

1434
00:59:30,103 --> 00:59:31,843
- Can we take it all? - Yes.

1435
00:59:32,843 --> 00:59:33,843
It's water.

1436
00:59:33,844 --> 00:59:35,472
- I've got water. - Give me some water.

1437
00:59:35,473 --> 00:59:39,182
(At that moment, Joo Hee turns around and walks out.)

1438
00:59:39,183 --> 00:59:40,843
Where is she going? And out of the blue.

1439
00:59:43,253 --> 00:59:46,623
(Jae Yeon follows Joo Hee outside.)

1440
00:59:47,523 --> 00:59:49,623
What's going on? It's like she's looking for someone.

1441
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:52,293
- Zo In Sung. - Zo In Sung.

1442
00:59:52,993 --> 00:59:54,093
- Zo In Sung? - Yes.

1443
00:59:54,163 --> 00:59:56,792
(Joo Hee approaches Sang Gyeong.)

1444
00:59:56,793 --> 00:59:58,702
- No, we're... - Do you want to talk?

1445
00:59:58,703 --> 01:00:01,173
(Do you want to talk?)

1446
01:00:01,633 --> 01:00:02,633
Okay.

1447
01:00:02,634 --> 01:00:05,343
(Sang Gyeong and Joo Hee leave together.)

1448
01:00:07,603 --> 01:00:09,243
I'm extremely quick-witted.

1449
01:00:10,173 --> 01:00:11,582
- What? - What?

1450
01:00:11,583 --> 01:00:12,742
What is it?

1451
01:00:12,743 --> 01:00:15,253
- Did you stop by? - It was uncomfortable over there.

1452
01:00:16,213 --> 01:00:17,483
It was uncomfortable.

1453
01:00:17,583 --> 01:00:19,582
- I see. - They're going to talk.

1454
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,752
It bothered me.

1455
01:00:20,753 --> 01:00:22,253
(He's bothered by the two.)

1456
01:00:23,623 --> 01:00:25,522
- We got busted. - For what?

1457
01:00:25,523 --> 01:00:27,122
- We got busted. - We got busted?

1458
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:29,563
- Yes, by Jae Yeon. - But this is no secret.

1459
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:33,303
Sang Gyeong can't help but consider Jae Yeon.

1460
01:00:34,103 --> 01:00:35,573
Why does this feel like cheating?

1461
01:00:37,403 --> 01:00:40,372
That's a very provocative word.

1462
01:00:40,373 --> 01:00:41,413
Right.

1463
01:00:44,243 --> 01:00:45,983
- This is so embarrassing. - What?

1464
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:48,583
Yes.

1465
01:00:49,213 --> 01:00:52,023
- Actually, - Yes?

1466
01:00:52,283 --> 01:00:54,023
- you left a big impression... - Yes?

1467
01:00:54,993 --> 01:00:56,123
during the speed train.

1468
01:00:59,693 --> 01:01:03,293
(During Round 3's speed date)

1469
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:05,163
Are you always this funny?

1470
01:01:05,533 --> 01:01:09,072
(The two had a fun conversation over the most trivial things.)

1471
01:01:09,073 --> 01:01:12,273
- My ideal type is someone funny. - Is that so?

1472
01:01:12,673 --> 01:01:14,302
The first impression must be important.

1473
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:15,742
Whether you have the same sense of humor is important.

1474
01:01:15,743 --> 01:01:17,713
Yes, it's important.

1475
01:01:18,313 --> 01:01:19,782
- I thought... - Yes?

1476
01:01:19,783 --> 01:01:22,982
you were on this show for fun.

1477
01:01:22,983 --> 01:01:24,052
- Me? - Yes.

1478
01:01:24,053 --> 01:01:26,322
- For real? - Yes.

1479
01:01:26,323 --> 01:01:28,192
It seems like everyone thinks like that.

1480
01:01:28,193 --> 01:01:29,323
- About me? - Yes.

1481
01:01:29,653 --> 01:01:31,492
- I wouldn't go for Number 18. - What?

1482
01:01:31,493 --> 01:01:32,823
I wouldn't go for Number 18.

1483
01:01:33,923 --> 01:01:35,862
She's quite flippant.

1484
01:01:35,863 --> 01:01:37,762
(He heard about Joo Hee from others.)

1485
01:01:37,763 --> 01:01:39,933
I think she wants to talk...

1486
01:01:40,503 --> 01:01:43,433
with many people but on a light level.

1487
01:01:44,543 --> 01:01:46,242
It seems like everyone thinks like that.

1488
01:01:46,243 --> 01:01:47,273
- About me? - Yes.

1489
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:48,913
Is that so?

1490
01:01:48,914 --> 01:01:52,883
And here's what I also thought.

1491
01:01:52,983 --> 01:01:54,552
Compared to the others,

1492
01:01:54,553 --> 01:01:56,482
- you're quite young. - Yes, I'm young.

1493
01:01:56,483 --> 01:02:00,783
I thought you might not be into marriage.

1494
01:02:00,983 --> 01:02:02,052
- Really? - Yes.

1495
01:02:02,053 --> 01:02:03,423
But I'm so serious about it.

1496
01:02:05,463 --> 01:02:08,962
Marriage to me is... Others might think like that.

1497
01:02:08,963 --> 01:02:10,593
- But I've always wanted... - Yes?

1498
01:02:11,203 --> 01:02:13,303
to get married before graduating from university.

1499
01:02:14,033 --> 01:02:15,903
Even during university, I wanted to get married.

1500
01:02:16,303 --> 01:02:19,273
I believe I'm quite late to the party.

1501
01:02:20,173 --> 01:02:23,373
It's to the point that I want to get married...

1502
01:02:24,113 --> 01:02:26,683
as soon as I meet the one.

1503
01:02:27,613 --> 01:02:28,782
(He realizes her true feelings for the first time.)

1504
01:02:28,783 --> 01:02:30,452
But nobody knew because I never talked about it.

1505
01:02:30,453 --> 01:02:31,453
Exactly.
Her enthusiasm...

1506
01:02:32,454 --> 01:02:34,082
- to get married... - Right.

1507
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:35,992
caused such misunderstanding.

1508
01:02:35,993 --> 01:02:37,823
That's totally possible. Yes.

1509
01:02:38,393 --> 01:02:41,633
Honestly, I had a great dilemma...

1510
01:02:42,193 --> 01:02:47,363
between you and Jae Yeon.

1511
01:02:48,403 --> 01:02:49,403
For so long.

1512
01:02:50,073 --> 01:02:52,243
- Really? I had no idea. - Yes.

1513
01:02:54,143 --> 01:02:55,172
Wasn't it obvious?

1514
01:02:55,173 --> 01:02:58,113
No. You were always smiling brightly,

1515
01:02:59,113 --> 01:03:00,442
so I thought you were just happy.

1516
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:03,682
I'm a bright person, but I did vote for you.

1517
01:03:03,683 --> 01:03:05,052
You did, but I thought it was for fun.

1518
01:03:05,053 --> 01:03:06,053
"For fun?"

1519
01:03:06,353 --> 01:03:08,352
- I see. Because it's fun? - That was...

1520
01:03:08,353 --> 01:03:10,152
Yes. I thought I had become...

1521
01:03:10,153 --> 01:03:12,222
- a fun friend to you. - Really?

1522
01:03:12,223 --> 01:03:15,363
Our conversations were always on fun topics.

1523
01:03:15,763 --> 01:03:19,603
That was why I couldn't notice it.

1524
01:03:20,133 --> 01:03:21,432
But it was too funny for us...

1525
01:03:21,433 --> 01:03:24,033
to have a serious conversation.

1526
01:03:24,373 --> 01:03:27,503
What was I supposed to do when everything you said was funny?

1527
01:03:27,773 --> 01:03:30,342
So, when you voted for me again,

1528
01:03:30,343 --> 01:03:32,382
it put me in a dilemma.

1529
01:03:32,383 --> 01:03:34,613
- You seemed serious about me. - Really?

1530
01:03:35,153 --> 01:03:37,683
I get everything now that we're talking.

1531
01:03:38,553 --> 01:03:40,783
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1532
01:03:41,523 --> 01:03:42,822
(The misunderstanding has been cleared up.)

1533
01:03:42,823 --> 01:03:44,663
It's so important to talk.

1534
01:03:44,763 --> 01:03:46,892
You're right. Talking is important.

1535
01:03:46,893 --> 01:03:49,592
- Yes. - He finally understood that...

1536
01:03:49,593 --> 01:03:51,063
she thought about him with sincerity.

1537
01:03:51,703 --> 01:03:52,733
I...

1538
01:03:56,103 --> 01:03:57,603
want to talk more.

1539
01:03:59,203 --> 01:04:00,203
I mean us.

1540
01:04:00,473 --> 01:04:02,712
(Knowing how Joo Hee feels, Sang Gyeong pushes ahead.)

1541
01:04:02,713 --> 01:04:03,773
- Really? - Yes.

1542
01:04:04,073 --> 01:04:05,113
I simply...

1543
01:04:07,643 --> 01:04:10,283
Will this bring a change or something?

1544
01:04:11,183 --> 01:04:13,182
He also had the wrong idea about me.

1545
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:15,723
But I'm as serious as anyone about this show.

1546
01:04:16,023 --> 01:04:18,793
I appeared on this show to get married no matter what.

1547
01:04:19,363 --> 01:04:20,593
But the misunderstanding has been cleared up.

1548
01:04:21,063 --> 01:04:23,032
We decided to clear up...

1549
01:04:23,033 --> 01:04:25,903
the misunderstandings we each had.

1550
01:04:27,003 --> 01:04:29,233
That was quite interesting.

1551
01:04:30,133 --> 01:04:32,543
(Meanwhile, in another part of the single zone,)

1552
01:04:33,003 --> 01:04:35,173
(Jae Keun is sorting out his thoughts alone.)

1553
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:38,183
Hi.

1554
01:04:38,383 --> 01:04:39,512
I want to talk to you.

1555
01:04:39,513 --> 01:04:40,643
- Talk? - Yes.

1556
01:04:42,213 --> 01:04:44,613
- I feel bad about something. - About what?

1557
01:04:44,723 --> 01:04:48,793
For not clearly choosing someone.

1558
01:04:49,153 --> 01:04:52,463
But that's to be expected. It's not the final decision.

1559
01:04:52,763 --> 01:04:55,033
I consider it as your right.

1560
01:04:56,363 --> 01:04:59,232
I'm not mad or anything.

1561
01:04:59,233 --> 01:05:00,833
I was just not entirely happy.

1562
01:05:01,303 --> 01:05:02,572
I thought you'd feel that way.

1563
01:05:02,573 --> 01:05:06,503
There are things that keep me wondering.

1564
01:05:07,673 --> 01:05:09,743
There's a huge time difference.

1565
01:05:10,173 --> 01:05:12,283
The time I've spent with him...

1566
01:05:12,383 --> 01:05:15,183
since our first decision...

1567
01:05:15,283 --> 01:05:17,812
Although we had...

1568
01:05:17,813 --> 01:05:21,393
- a simple meal together, - Right.

1569
01:05:21,923 --> 01:05:26,363
our conversation was very invaluable.

1570
01:05:26,823 --> 01:05:29,893
It didn't even last for an hour,

1571
01:05:31,603 --> 01:05:34,003
but I felt your sincerity.

1572
01:05:34,803 --> 01:05:38,033
I pictured our future for the very first time.

1573
01:05:38,543 --> 01:05:40,973
(Jae Keun opens his heart to Jin Ju.)

1574
01:05:41,203 --> 01:05:43,913
"I'm not happy. I'm quite upset."

1575
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:48,713
I hated the idea that she might catch on to my lousy feelings.

1576
01:05:49,083 --> 01:05:51,523
(Joo Hee is done talking to Sang Gyeong.)

1577
01:05:51,823 --> 01:05:53,982
(She immediately runs into Jin Ju.)

1578
01:05:53,983 --> 01:05:56,923
- Why did you drink so much? - Who did you talk with?

1579
01:05:57,123 --> 01:05:59,023
- Number 24. - Number 24?

1580
01:05:59,693 --> 01:06:01,593
Is he one of the people you're thinking about?

1581
01:06:01,693 --> 01:06:03,792
It's either Numbers 7 or 24 for me.

1582
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:04,832
- Is it the two? - Yes.

1583
01:06:04,833 --> 01:06:06,332
- I see. - Things were tough...

1584
01:06:06,333 --> 01:06:07,533
because of the two.

1585
01:06:07,633 --> 01:06:08,773
Really?

1586
01:06:09,503 --> 01:06:10,633
She didn't know about it.

1587
01:06:11,303 --> 01:06:13,743
- He's popular. - He's a popular guy.

1588
01:06:15,173 --> 01:06:18,613
Joo Hee wasn't in the picture. She came out of nowhere.

1589
01:06:19,743 --> 01:06:22,212
- Jin Ju had no idea. - No, she didn't.

1590
01:06:22,213 --> 01:06:24,923
I'm guessing they didn't know what was going on.

1591
01:06:26,183 --> 01:06:28,893
(They get ready to go back to their rooms.)

1592
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:31,153
Where were you?

1593
01:06:31,863 --> 01:06:33,292
I talked with Number 24.

1594
01:06:33,293 --> 01:06:34,293
- Until now? - Yes.

1595
01:06:34,723 --> 01:06:37,263
I'm losing my mind.

1596
01:06:39,803 --> 01:06:41,062
The atmosphere is turning cold.

1597
01:06:41,063 --> 01:06:42,373
(The atmosphere is suddenly awkward.)

1598
01:06:42,733 --> 01:06:44,073
What are you troubled about?

1599
01:06:44,533 --> 01:06:45,903
Is it the opposite of mine?

1600
01:06:48,273 --> 01:06:50,143
My plan was to cut things off.

1601
01:06:50,243 --> 01:06:53,043
- He picked you as the first choice. - Right.

1602
01:06:53,143 --> 01:06:54,913
I thought he had no feelings for me.

1603
01:06:55,683 --> 01:06:57,912
- I was going to make... - Let's go.

1604
01:06:57,913 --> 01:06:59,583
a clean-cut.

1605
01:07:00,323 --> 01:07:01,793
Did that change after talking to him?

1606
01:07:03,593 --> 01:07:05,292
Why does Joo Hee have to explain herself?

1607
01:07:05,293 --> 01:07:06,293
Exactly.

1608
01:07:08,193 --> 01:07:10,033
We should talk, too.

1609
01:07:10,533 --> 01:07:14,202
How are you feeling now? Is your dilemma back?

1610
01:07:14,203 --> 01:07:15,203
Or what?

1611
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:19,643
I'll most likely choose Number 24.

1612
01:07:19,743 --> 01:07:21,003
- Really? - Yes.

1613
01:07:22,073 --> 01:07:24,573
I see. And Joo Hee has said it.

1614
01:07:26,283 --> 01:07:27,613
I'm not sure, either.

1615
01:07:30,483 --> 01:07:32,483
They both have a lot to think about now.

1616
01:07:35,193 --> 01:07:38,463
My mind was set on Number 24 from now on.

1617
01:07:38,563 --> 01:07:40,622
- Really? - It's because...

1618
01:07:40,623 --> 01:07:42,293
he gave me assurance.

1619
01:07:43,133 --> 01:07:45,402
I thought you were thinking between...

1620
01:07:45,403 --> 01:07:46,903
Numbers 13 and 7.

1621
01:07:47,433 --> 01:07:48,772
I didn't know it was Number 24.

1622
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:50,502
I kept telling you it was Number 24.

1623
01:07:50,503 --> 01:07:52,642
I thought it was Numbers 7 and 13.

1624
01:07:52,643 --> 01:07:53,643
Really?

1625
01:07:54,073 --> 01:07:56,673
(Joo Hee was honest to Jin Ju.)

1626
01:07:57,213 --> 01:08:01,683
(She even talked about Sang Gyeong.)

1627
01:08:01,783 --> 01:08:04,553
(But the conversation led to a misunderstanding.)

1628
01:08:04,653 --> 01:08:06,222
Everyone thought her dilemma...

1629
01:08:06,223 --> 01:08:08,792
was between Numbers 13 and 7.

1630
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:11,722
But suddenly, she said, "Number 24 has been looking handsome..."

1631
01:08:11,723 --> 01:08:14,593
"since last night." That took us by surprise.

1632
01:08:14,823 --> 01:08:17,163
From what I heard, Joo Hee called Number 24 over...

1633
01:08:18,403 --> 01:08:20,663
and sort of persuaded him to date her.

1634
01:08:22,003 --> 01:08:23,003
It's tough.

1635
01:08:23,004 --> 01:08:24,732
(Jin Ju directly came over to Sang Gyeong.)

1636
01:08:24,733 --> 01:08:26,373
I want to talk to you today.

1637
01:08:27,003 --> 01:08:28,073
We can talk tomorrow.

1638
01:08:28,173 --> 01:08:29,343
I want to talk today.

1639
01:08:29,543 --> 01:08:30,543
Talk here.

1640
01:08:31,413 --> 01:08:32,443
I'll give you privacy.

1641
01:08:32,613 --> 01:08:34,212
Jin Ju is bothered...

1642
01:08:34,213 --> 01:08:35,652
- by Joo Hee's words. - It seems like it.

1643
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:38,052
Thinking one thing after the other has made...

1644
01:08:38,053 --> 01:08:39,053
her more anxious.

1645
01:08:39,753 --> 01:08:41,723
Are you upset I didn't vote for you twice?

1646
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:44,552
Well, I was quite disappointed.

1647
01:08:44,553 --> 01:08:46,763
But I didn't know.

1648
01:08:46,863 --> 01:08:49,633
I didn't know it was our ticket to the couple zone.

1649
01:08:50,663 --> 01:08:51,663
I don't blame you.

1650
01:08:52,363 --> 01:08:55,303
Earlier, I felt really...

1651
01:08:55,733 --> 01:08:56,903
Don't worry too much.

1652
01:08:57,403 --> 01:08:59,203
But I felt terrible for some reason.

1653
01:09:01,373 --> 01:09:02,813
Jin Ju and I...

1654
01:09:03,873 --> 01:09:06,683
cleared up what you could say was a misunderstanding.

1655
01:09:07,283 --> 01:09:11,483
It's thrown me into confusion. I wonder what this is all about.

1656
01:09:13,353 --> 01:09:16,353
I didn't know Joo Hee was thinking about Number 24.

1657
01:09:16,793 --> 01:09:18,362
I was really taken aback.

1658
01:09:18,363 --> 01:09:19,862
In the car, she made a fuss about...

1659
01:09:19,863 --> 01:09:21,122
- how handsome he was. - Joo Hee did?

1660
01:09:21,123 --> 01:09:22,592
- Yes. - From what I see,

1661
01:09:22,593 --> 01:09:24,263
Joo Hee likes Number 24 a lot.

1662
01:09:25,603 --> 01:09:29,533
(Jin Ju asked Joo Hee about her true feelings.)

1663
01:09:29,833 --> 01:09:33,603
(I'll most likely choose Number 24.)

1664
01:09:34,743 --> 01:09:38,043
He's so annoying!

1665
01:09:39,113 --> 01:09:40,843
What? What are you talking about?

1666
01:09:41,213 --> 01:09:42,553
He's just that handsome.

1667
01:09:42,653 --> 01:09:44,013
Oh, come on.

1668
01:09:44,313 --> 01:09:47,582
Joo Hee told you how she felt about Number 24.

1669
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:49,352
- Yes. - She wanted you...

1670
01:09:49,353 --> 01:09:51,092
- to hear it. - Out of the blue,

1671
01:09:51,093 --> 01:09:53,292
- Really? - she sat next to me in the car.

1672
01:09:53,293 --> 01:09:54,622
- I didn't know. - We didn't ask her.

1673
01:09:54,623 --> 01:09:56,262
- I didn't see it. - "I was going to cut off Number 24,

1674
01:09:56,263 --> 01:09:58,502
but my feelings grew back."

1675
01:09:58,503 --> 01:10:00,033
That was the end of the conversation.

1676
01:10:00,133 --> 01:10:02,532
- But she talked to herself about... - My eyes were closed.

1677
01:10:02,533 --> 01:10:04,603
how handsome he was when nobody asked.

1678
01:10:05,203 --> 01:10:07,273
Number 24 only voted for Jin Ju.

1679
01:10:07,643 --> 01:10:09,772
It felt like she deliberately said it...

1680
01:10:09,773 --> 01:10:11,613
for Jin Ju to hear.

1681
01:10:12,143 --> 01:10:14,742
When someone suddenly provokes you...

1682
01:10:14,743 --> 01:10:17,552
when you're in a dilemma,

1683
01:10:17,553 --> 01:10:19,483
- Right. - don't you get upset?

1684
01:10:20,053 --> 01:10:22,422
- But... - I bet she irritated you.

1685
01:10:22,423 --> 01:10:23,723
How does it irritate you?

1686
01:10:24,093 --> 01:10:25,392
I get irritated.

1687
01:10:25,393 --> 01:10:26,922
I assumed you got irritated.

1688
01:10:26,923 --> 01:10:28,493
I did. I was like, "What?"

1689
01:10:29,993 --> 01:10:33,103
From what I see, you're the one holding all the cards.

1690
01:10:34,033 --> 01:10:36,033
It'll depend on your decision.

1691
01:10:37,373 --> 01:10:38,472
What do I do?

1692
01:10:38,473 --> 01:10:40,203
(Jin Ju's dilemma gets worse.)

1693
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:46,743
(Everyone has left aside from Jung Won and Ha Yeon.)

1694
01:10:47,643 --> 01:10:48,983
Did your interview go well?

1695
01:10:49,683 --> 01:10:53,353
Me? It wasn't that fun.

1696
01:10:53,623 --> 01:10:55,823
- Is that so? - You did your interview, right?

1697
01:10:55,923 --> 01:10:57,123
Can I share it?

1698
01:10:58,593 --> 01:11:00,023
Will Jung Won find out?

1699
01:11:01,263 --> 01:11:02,292
Tell him.

1700
01:11:02,293 --> 01:11:03,833
- Tell him. - Tell him.

1701
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:05,663
Can I share it?

1702
01:11:06,703 --> 01:11:09,873
He kept asking me about Sin Da.

1703
01:11:10,303 --> 01:11:11,333
She's my roommate.

1704
01:11:12,003 --> 01:11:13,073
- Really? - Yes.

1705
01:11:13,743 --> 01:11:14,773
Nice.

1706
01:11:15,213 --> 01:11:18,113
The arrows pointing to Ji Woong...

1707
01:11:19,913 --> 01:11:21,683
I had no idea.

1708
01:11:24,183 --> 01:11:25,183
But...

1709
01:11:26,223 --> 01:11:28,183
the two must have a thing. I don't know.

1710
01:11:29,993 --> 01:11:31,923
Really? We never talked about him.

1711
01:11:32,423 --> 01:11:35,663
Is that so? Was it not brought up during the interview?

1712
01:11:35,763 --> 01:11:38,663
I'm talking about Sin Da, not the interview.

1713
01:11:40,363 --> 01:11:43,302
But now that you two have become a couple,

1714
01:11:43,303 --> 01:11:45,572
Sin Da will focus on you.

1715
01:11:45,573 --> 01:11:47,473
- It's just... - That might not be the case.

1716
01:11:48,303 --> 01:11:50,843
We can never know what's on her mind.

1717
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:53,843
I suddenly...

1718
01:11:55,483 --> 01:11:56,752
(During the speed date in Round 3,)

1719
01:11:56,753 --> 01:11:57,913
(the first person Sin Da visited.)

1720
01:11:58,523 --> 01:11:59,982
(Ji Woong was confident about...)

1721
01:11:59,983 --> 01:12:01,652
(preparing a house that's worth over 2 million dollars.)

1722
01:12:01,653 --> 01:12:03,753
We get along.

1723
01:12:03,853 --> 01:12:04,853
Come here.

1724
01:12:04,854 --> 01:12:08,063
(Someone invited Ji Woong to the single zone party.)

1725
01:12:08,293 --> 01:12:09,592
- Is this... - Come here.

1726
01:12:09,593 --> 01:12:11,033
- Yes. - Sit down.

1727
01:12:11,333 --> 01:12:12,733
Who...

1728
01:12:13,163 --> 01:12:14,502
(During the single zone party,)

1729
01:12:14,503 --> 01:12:15,772
(Jung Won asked about where Sin Da was.)

1730
01:12:15,773 --> 01:12:17,033
(Sin Da didn't say anything.)

1731
01:12:17,073 --> 01:12:20,943
Are you pretty serious with the person you're matched with?

1732
01:12:22,213 --> 01:12:24,912
(Sin Da and Ji Woong's date...)

1733
01:12:24,913 --> 01:12:27,143
(looked like it was going to be kept a secret.)

1734
01:12:29,513 --> 01:12:30,583
I'm...

1735
01:12:31,453 --> 01:12:33,052
swayed once again.

1736
01:12:33,053 --> 01:12:35,053
(To be continued)

1737
01:12:35,584 --> 01:12:38,444
(A silent night when everyone's asleep.)

1738
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:43,354
(Sin Da is up alone.)

1739
01:12:44,184 --> 01:12:46,493
(She carefully comes out...)

1740
01:12:46,494 --> 01:12:50,163
(and heads somewhere.)

1741
01:12:50,164 --> 01:12:51,393
- Where's she going? - What's she doing?

1742
01:12:51,394 --> 01:12:53,133
- She's putting it in. - The mailbox.

1743
01:12:53,134 --> 01:12:54,294
The secret mailbox.

1744
01:12:56,104 --> 01:12:58,203
(Sin Da asked someone out secretly.)

1745
01:12:58,204 --> 01:13:00,033
That gave me the chills.

1746
01:13:00,034 --> 01:13:01,633
- What was that? - That gave me the chills.

1747
01:13:01,634 --> 01:13:03,243
- I'm getting goosebumps. - Me too.

1748
01:13:03,244 --> 01:13:04,643
- When she just arrived? - Look at me.

1749
01:13:04,644 --> 01:13:06,213
- I'm getting goosebumps for real. - Yes.

1750
01:13:06,214 --> 01:13:07,644
- Yes. - I'm getting goosebumps.

1751
01:13:07,744 --> 01:13:09,143
That's crazy.

1752
01:13:09,144 --> 01:13:10,443
- COUPLE PALACE... - He wasn't the one?

1753
01:13:10,444 --> 01:13:11,783
It's more fun than a TV show.

1754
01:13:11,784 --> 01:13:13,384
- Right. - That's unbelievable.

1755
01:13:14,330 --> 01:13:16,770
(Everyone's curious about Hye Won's vote.)

1756
01:13:16,940 --> 01:13:18,570
(I...)

1757
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:20,309
(What?)

1758
01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:21,670
(That's a twist.)

1759
01:13:21,770 --> 01:13:24,010
(Hye Won's being proactive?)

1760
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:28,310
(Joo Hee's eyeing Sang Gyeong.)

1761
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:29,680
(The time has come.)

1762
01:13:29,850 --> 01:13:31,420
(Joo Hee makes Jin Ju nervous.)

1763
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:32,990
(I made it pretty clear.)

1764
01:13:33,490 --> 01:13:35,520
(Jin Ju makes a crazy announcement.)

1765
01:13:35,690 --> 01:13:37,220
(I can't stand to watch them working it out.)

1766
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:39,529
(Did you hear anything?)

1767
01:13:39,530 --> 01:13:40,730
(Is it okay to say this?)

1768
01:13:40,930 --> 01:13:42,300
(Whatever.)

1769
01:13:42,730 --> 01:13:44,200
(The single men and women's hearts fluctuate.)

1770
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:45,500
(Meanwhile, a strange air in the couple zone)

1771
01:13:46,270 --> 01:13:47,769
(Do you want to be swayed?)

1772
01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:49,569
(You can never expect where it might go.)

1773
01:13:49,570 --> 01:13:50,899
(Don't you want to visit the single zone?)

1774
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:53,740
(How can I secure Ji Woong?)

1775
01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:55,540
(I have something to say.)

1776
01:13:55,710 --> 01:13:58,179
(Male Number...)

1777
01:13:58,180 --> 01:14:01,510
(is moving to the single zone from the couple zone.)

1778
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:04,020
(What will become of their entangled relationships?)
