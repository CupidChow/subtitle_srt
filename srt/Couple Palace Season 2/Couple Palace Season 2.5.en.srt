1
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:12,820
(COUPLE PALACE 2)

2
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,460
For those who chose the couple zone...

3
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,790
please go to the couple zone.

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,470
It's time to choose in the couple zone.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,199
They might not see each other there.

6
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,169
Right. They might find themselves alone in the couple zone.

7
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,340
They could be alone.

8
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,880
(Who's entering the couple zone?)

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,219
(The person who chose the couple zone)

10
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,280
The couple zone.

11
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,449
(10, Lim Si Yeon, fashion brand CEO)

12
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,450
Si Yeon chose the couple zone.

13
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,190
She just needs Hyun Joong.

14
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:55,190
I wasn't interested in anyone other than Male Number Four.

15
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,599
(The Time of Verification)

16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,900
(Do you like someone older or young or your age?)

17
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,300
(Hyun Joong said he prefers someone younger.)

18
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,299
(I'm 33.)

19
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,010
(I was born in 1992.)

20
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,510
(Sighing)

21
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,949
(I was born in 1990.)

22
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:14,950
- In 1990? - Oh, no.

23
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:16,009
(Si Yeon is 2 years older than Hyun Joong.)

24
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,180
They're two years apart.

25
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:21,020
Hyun Joong expected Si Yeon to be younger than him.

26
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,060
He was younger than me as I expected.

27
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,890
That's what worries me.

28
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:32,500
(Did Hyun Joong choose the couple zone?)

29
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,129
(Si Yeon smiles brightly after checking the couple room.)

30
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,499
- Hi. - Gosh.

31
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,999
(Hyun Joong also chose the couple zone.)

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,099
Okay.

33
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,240
- He's here. - Are we getting up?

34
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,910
(Congratulations.)

35
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,779
If I heard her age from the start,

36
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,150
I might not have opened up.

37
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,549
Then I realized age...

38
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,289
didn't matter that much.

39
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,350
(Then I realized age didn't matter that much.)

40
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,190
(The two chose the couple zone despite the age gap.)

41
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,290
He chose love.

42
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,259
Is it better to drop the honorifics?

43
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,759
Is that what you prefer?

44
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,629
- I don't care. - Me neither.

45
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,539
What if it creates a wall...

46
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,640
Then let's drop it.

47
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,140
- Sure. - What's this?

48
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,879
You asked me first, but you were so careful.

49
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,119
I was flustered.

50
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,950
It's better to drop it. Yes.

51
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,920
It might create a wall.

52
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,020
- What? - Nothing.

53
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,920
- What? - You're cute.

54
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,159
(Another man and woman who chose the couple zone?)

55
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,430
Oh, what?

56
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,299
Seriously.

57
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,569
(Yun Ye Rim, Song Joon Ho)

58
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,000
What's the matter with you?

59
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,669
(17, Kim Eun Jung, conservative naive cafe owner)

60
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,679
(10, Choi Min Seok, Daechi-dong extrovert S Electronics employee)

61
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,710
Welcome.

62
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,010
- Hello. - Hello.

63
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,219
You're here.

64
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,850
(Go Yu Na, Im Han Sae)

65
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,819
(26, Kim Ha Yeon, beautiful Busan elementary school teacher)

66
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,889
- Ha Yeon is here. - She is.

67
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,989
Her relationship with Ji Woong is unstable.

68
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,060
It's unstable.

69
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,259
(The Time of Verification)

70
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,260
(Yes.)

71
00:03:10,261 --> 00:03:12,159
(It means a flower that blooms in mud.)

72
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,899
(Then let me make it muddy.)

73
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,439
(Born in 1998?)

74
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,909
(Born in 1999?)

75
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:25,380
(Ji Woong was flustered by Ha Yeon's age.)

76
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,380
I expected Ji Woong to choose me.

77
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,160
So I opened the door in excitement.

78
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,960
No? No one?

79
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,100
There was no one.

80
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,859
- He's not there. - It's empty.

81
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,000
(Ha Yeon and Ji Woong's couple room is empty.)

82
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,799
Is he not here yet?

83
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,600
Or did he go to the single zone?

84
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,239
(Another person visits the couple zone.)

85
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,549
(13, Kim Soo Min, cute major corporation employee)

86
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,010
- It's Soo Min. - She's here.

87
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:08,190
I chose the couple zone without hesitation.

88
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,660
(Soo Min heads to the couple room without hesitation.)

89
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,260
- Hi. - Hi.

90
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,929
I knew it.

91
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,630
They're the certain couple of this season.

92
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,159
Hi.

93
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,399
(19, Cho Yeong Seok, the former student president pharmacist)

94
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,970
I chose the couple zone without a second thought.

95
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,940
I had groundless trust.

96
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,670
I liked her.

97
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,470
Yes, I liked her.

98
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,379
Oh, my gosh.

99
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,040
(The two chose each other without hesitation.)

100
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,420
I finally get to see you closely.

101
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,549
- Oh, my! What was that? - Oh, my gosh.

102
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,649
He saw her before.

103
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,860
- What is he talking about? - Oh, my gosh.

104
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:52,330
(Yeong Seok reaches out to Soo Min.)

105
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,299
Oh, my gosh.

106
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,199
(Soo Min holds Yeong Seok's hand.)

107
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,969
At that moment, I realized...

108
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,280
his eyes were filled with love.

109
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,650
It was romantic. I liked it.

110
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,520
They're giving me butterflies.

111
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,350
(In the meantime)

112
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,820
(Ha Yeon is alone in the couple zone.)

113
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,119
Oh, Ji Woong.

114
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,660
It'd be funny if he popped out of the closet.

115
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,260
I knew she'd come.

116
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,269
(Ji Woong peeps out.)

117
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,570
- What? - What?

118
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,200
I knew she was guaranteed to come.

119
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,670
I was hiding in the restroom.

120
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,739
I was right. My goodness.

121
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,279
- For real? - What?

122
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,580
But I was joking.

123
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,280
Oh, what?

124
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,989
(Ha Yeon spots Ji Woong who was hiding.)

125
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,190
- Where were you? - Did I scare you?

126
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,319
- I thought you weren't here. - What?

127
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,989
- Were you going to go home? - Yes.

128
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,059
You're lying.

129
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,629
- I thought I had to pack up. - Were you going to leave?

130
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,870
- Why did you do that? - I waited for a long time.

131
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,600
I was glad to see him.

132
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,069
I decided...

133
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,740
to focus on Ji Woong even more.

134
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,979
I chose the couple zone.

135
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,510
The pros outweighed the cons with Ha Yeon.

136
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,880
But...

137
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,189
she's my second-best option.

138
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:25,560
She's not the best.

139
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,960
- We need to talk about bad stuff. - Why?

140
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,259
We only talked about positive topics.

141
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,230
Let's see if we can handle negative topics.

142
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,370
Let's do it.

143
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,769
- Are you okay with the age gap? - I don't care.

144
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,069
- I sulk easily. - I'll make you feel better.

145
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,170
I'm kind of rude. Are you okay with that?

146
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,339
What if I tell you about my past relationship?

147
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,609
What if I have a child?

148
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,250
I have children all over the world.

149
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,050
What?

150
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,350
- What? - What's he talking about?

151
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,889
He's not considerate of her feelings.

152
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:00,019
But when it comes to love,

153
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,229
- the one who loves more gives in. - Yes.

154
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,059
- So, for now... - She's holding back.

155
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,199
- Because she likes him more. - That's what I think.

156
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,200
(Because Ha Yeon likes him more, she endures it for now.)

157
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,100
Now, it's the single zone.

158
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,369
We met again.

159
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,740
We got to meet again.

160
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,750
- Have you been well? - Yes.

161
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,079
"Have you been well?" What was that?

162
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,980
(Jae Keun and Hye Won met again.)

163
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,419
I don't know.

164
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,520
I can never grasp Hye Won.

165
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,389
She turned me down.

166
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:35,390
Is she interested in someone else?

167
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,600
(Jae Keun can't stop looking at Hye Won.)

168
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,169
- Yes. - Really?

169
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,669
(Someone watches Jae Keun.)

170
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,640
Why are you being so shy?

171
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,880
I was glad to see Male Number Three the most.

172
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:57,050
Seo Hee says she's happy to see Jae Keun.

173
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,990
(Jae Keun was an additional resident.)

174
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:04,020
(Let's talk a lot.)

175
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,460
(Seo Hee didn't hide how happy she was to see Jae Keun.)

176
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,790
- Do you want to take a seat? - Sure.

177
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,060
- Have a seat. - Yes.

178
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:16,130
I want to face Male Number Three head-on.

179
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:19,099
I'm happy to be back here.

180
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,009
Do you know what really upset me?

181
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,039
What?

182
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,040
When I said...

183
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,840
I chose Male Number 28,

184
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:30,309
you were clapping with a big smile on your face.

185
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,350
Because...

186
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:35,450
(During Palace Week Matching)

187
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,289
He was clapping while looking so happy.

188
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,959
I didn't know what to feel.

189
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,190
(Seo Hee noticed Jae Keun who was clapping.)

190
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:45,400
It made me very upset.

191
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,170
It'd hurt my sense of pride if I looked small.

192
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,329
- I didn't want to appear that way, - That's fair.

193
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,439
- Okay. - so I pretended to be cool with it.

194
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,569
- Okay, I got it. - I clapped.

195
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,639
(He pretended to be okay with it.)

196
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,709
I didn't curse,

197
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,640
but I did complain about it.

198
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,750
I said something like, "She's leaving me too."

199
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,120
You didn't pick me, did you?

200
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,590
- I won't make any comment. - You can't tell me?

201
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,320
- That's confidential. - All right.

202
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:16,230
(The two of them just drink in silence.)

203
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,430
I never got to talk to Number 19 in private.

204
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,670
She doesn't like being uncomfortable.

205
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,570
It seemed like she was avoiding me.

206
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,680
She's constantly on his mind.

207
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,710
He got rejected once,

208
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,750
so he's being hesitant.

209
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,350
Gosh, this isn't easy.

210
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,989
I think I should stay here.

211
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,490
- Why? - I'm shy around strangers,

212
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,690
so I have a hard time fitting in.

213
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,000
I hope that they'll talk soon.

214
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,630
(Hye Won comes back to the common lounge.)

215
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,099
(Now they're in the same space.)

216
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,109
No, I mean...

217
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,809
Seriously, I have no idea.

218
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,210
In my case...

219
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,480
- Hello. - Hello.

220
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:12,319
I don't have something to say,

221
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,490
but I'd like to...

222
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,650
- talk to you. - Okay.

223
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,320
- I'd like to know something. - Okay.

224
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,130
When would that be?

225
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:23,889
Why can't they talk now?

226
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:24,900
This is fun.

227
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,540
When I wasn't matched with Hye Won,

228
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,309
I thought that I should go home.

229
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,310
And so...

230
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,640
And so...

231
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,340
I didn't get to see...

232
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,980
to whom Jae Keun expressed his feelings.

233
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,780
(Please take the path to happiness with me.)

234
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,349
(Seo Hee didn't know Jae Keun asked Hye Won...)

235
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,020
(to join him at Palace Week.)

236
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,860
It seemed like he asked Yoo Hye Won to join him at Palace Week.

237
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,770
I thought, "What's wrong with her?"

238
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,129
Seo Hee is invisible to Jae Keun right now.

239
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,070
- He doesn't see her. - He doesn't.

240
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,040
It's nice to see you again.

241
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,839
It's definitely a love triangle.

242
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,840
(That's how the love triangle started.)

243
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,080
Gosh, I got stood up.

244
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,920
- He's here. - It's Sang Joon.

245
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,550
My confidence and sense of pride were damaged.

246
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,560
Should I leave?

247
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,430
Should I leave this place?

248
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,590
He's coming.

249
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,459
There he is.

250
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,800
Our friend born in 1979 is here.

251
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,870
Hello.

252
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,600
Hello.

253
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,810
(Laughing)

254
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,740
He's so positive.

255
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,709
The three of them...

256
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,110
They're doing something.

257
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,210
The couples?

258
00:11:49,211 --> 00:11:50,979
Are the couples on a date?

259
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,019
I see.

260
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,020
Is that so?

261
00:11:53,021 --> 00:11:55,490
They're so awkward. Even the vibe is awkward.

262
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,560
Why do you look so down?

263
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,330
I'm sorry about...

264
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,029
making you embarrassed.

265
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,229
No, it's okay.

266
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:10,899
When I was alone in the hotel room,

267
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:15,009
it was slightly depressing.

268
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,170
It didn't last long.

269
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,010
I feel honored by the fact that you picked me three times.

270
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,380
(Feeling uncomfortable)

271
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,320
I'm the man who got picked by you three times.

272
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:33,419
It completely raised my self-esteem.

273
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,430
(Staring)

274
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,700
He's a great person,

275
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,770
but I don't see him as a man.

276
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:48,010
Male Number 28 is...

277
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,610
like the Frog Prince to me.

278
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,480
Would you kiss this frog?

279
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,010
Reality is different from fairy tales.

280
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,620
No matter how good of a person he is,

281
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,489
if you can't kiss him,

282
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,019
- Right. - it'd be like torture.

283
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,889
Physical contact is very important.

284
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,220
That's a common case.

285
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,859
(An alarm goes off in the single zone.)

286
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,000
What is it now?

287
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,960
Now that you have chosen the single zone,

288
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:17,469
- you must find a new partner. - Goodness.

289
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:20,600
You will pick a new partner that you favor.

290
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,739
The favorability vote will start now.

291
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,910
(They will now pick a new partner that they favor.)

292
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,609
Oh, my gosh.

293
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,209
I haven't been matched with anyone.

294
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,250
You can pick anyone.

295
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,480
Please pick the member of the opposite sex...

296
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,580
except the one you were previously matched with.

297
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,090
I'm drawing a blank.

298
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,560
They can't choose their previous partner?

299
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,720
No.

300
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,420
Making a choice never ends.

301
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,460
Jae Keun, are you going to choose Number 19?

302
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,760
I honestly don't know.

303
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,430
- You don't know? - Number 19...

304
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,440
I don't know what she wants.

305
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,270
It must be confusing.

306
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,580
(Women's lounge)

307
00:13:58,581 --> 00:14:00,280
(The alarm goes off again.)

308
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,780
Today, the women's choices will be revealed.

309
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,220
They're being revealed?

310
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,290
Deliver your profile card to the man of your choice.

311
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,820
- Oh, no. - Seriously.

312
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,159
Number 23, Seo Jin Ju. Please deliver your profile card.

313
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,629
- Jin Ju. - Jin Ju.

314
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,899
How can I give it to him?

315
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,930
Goodness.

316
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,630
- I'll be back. - Good luck.

317
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,300
Who will she pick?

318
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,169
Sang Gyeong and Jin Ju were a couple.

319
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,170
Right.

320
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,579
(While choosing the couple zone)

321
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,950
(Jin Ju wanted the couple zone, but Sang Gyeong didn't.)

322
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:40,550
(After the breakup, Jin Ju came to the single zone.)

323
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:45,290
(I went to the couple zone because he said, "See you later.")

324
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,860
There was someone else I was thinking about.

325
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,730
I was curious about him the most excluding my previous partner.

326
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,629
She has to ask someone else out

327
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,270
right in front of her partner.

328
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,899
- Who will it be? - Who will it be?

329
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,910
(Who was Jin Ju curious about?)

330
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,039
Hello.

331
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,580
- Jin Ju, pearl. - Pearl.

332
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,310
- Pearl. - Who will it be?

333
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,820
I came to give this to you.

334
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,090
As soon as I entered, I saw him first.

335
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,820
He was probably thinking, "Let's see who she picks."

336
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,490
My goodness.

337
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,130
(Seo Jin Ju gives it to Hwang Jae Keun.)

338
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,830
(Exclaiming)

339
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,500
Goodbye. Have a good night.

340
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:31,170
Gosh, I knew she'd choose him.

341
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,810
She had feelings for Number Three, Jae Keun.

342
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:36,669
I came back alive.

343
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:40,240
(Jae Keun entered Palace Week like a twist of fate.)

344
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,380
You must be happy, but you can't show it comfortably.

345
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,889
(Jae Keun and Sang Gyeong are walking on eggshells.)

346
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,720
As soon as I saw it...

347
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,990
Number Eight, Choi Seo Hee.

348
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,330
Hello.

349
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,860
Fairy Seo Hee.

350
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,170
Number 28 was sitting next to Number 3.

351
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,730
I felt bad,

352
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,600
but I had to go my way.

353
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:08,939
(Choi Seo Hee gives it to Hwang Jae Keun.)

354
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,170
Thank you.

355
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,409
Number Four, Kim Jae Na.

356
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,950
(Who is Jae Na's new partner?)

357
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,879
No way. What's going on here?

358
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,590
It's embarrassing. I'm leaving.

359
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,890
This is crazy.

360
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,960
Oh, no. What do I do?

361
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,590
He should be considered the most popular man.

362
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,460
Thank you.

363
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,200
It was mentally healing for me.

364
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,940
The scar from the last round was healed,

365
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:42,240
and the skin grew anew.

366
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,240
Jae Keun is so popular.

367
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,850
Did I pick the same person?

368
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,809
The applause was loud.

369
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,119
It must be someone who received more than one.

370
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,280
Who did you give it to?

371
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,980
Number Three.

372
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,790
I see.

373
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,490
I bet many people chose Number Three.

374
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,129
(All the votes went to Jae Keun.)

375
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,690
I also picked Number Three.

376
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,200
More than three people picked Number Three.

377
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,200
There's an overlap.

378
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,829
After coming to the single zone,

379
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,640
his popularity suddenly increased.

380
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,970
Hye Won doesn't like popular men.

381
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:19,909
Number 19, Yoo Hye Won. Please deliver your profile card.

382
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,110
Go ahead.

383
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,980
Okay.

384
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,680
I can't wait to find out who Number 19 will pick.

385
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,150
Who was her original choice?

386
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,720
Jae Keun.

387
00:17:29,721 --> 00:17:31,490
(Jae Keun picked Hye Won, but he was rejected.)

388
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,990
(She enters cautiously.)

389
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,360
I was curious to find out her choice.

390
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:39,930
Who will it be?

391
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,429
(It's hard to tell what's on Hye Won's mind.)

392
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,600
It's a nerve-racking moment.

393
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,010
Who will it be?

394
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,550
- Who is it? - Who is it?

395
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,250
Here you go.

396
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,789
Why are you doing this, Hye Won?

397
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:06,260
(Her choice was Jae Keun.)

398
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,629
- Goodness. - It's a success.

399
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,400
He looks extremely happy.

400
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,460
(After picking Jae Keun, she leaves leisurely.)

401
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,460
Bye.

402
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,030
She's playing with my heart.

403
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,769
I feel so... Goodness.

404
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:19,770
(Jae Keun feels confused.)

405
00:18:19,771 --> 00:18:21,170
- His heart melted. - Right.

406
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,870
His heart melted like snow.

407
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,640
I really can't read her.

408
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,950
- Did you do well? - Yes.

409
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,149
Based on the sound, it seems like our choices might've overlapped.

410
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:35,019
(Their interests are all tangled up.)

411
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,020
He's popular.

412
00:18:36,021 --> 00:18:39,620
(They finish voting for new partners they're interested in.)

413
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,160
By the way, I have a question.

414
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,190
- Jae Keun... - Yes.

415
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,930
- You chose Jae Keun. - Yes.

416
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,570
Why aren't you talking to him?

417
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,810
It seemed you received a lot of votes.

418
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,110
Yes. Why is that?

419
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,609
Please value my vote.

420
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,510
It's so valuable. I mean it.

421
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,180
I'll keep them safely in my heart.

422
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,749
Well, he's talking to someone else.

423
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,219
So I can't just interrupt...

424
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,720
- Jae Keun. Come here. - My gosh.

425
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,620
Hurry.

426
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,419
(Jae Keun approaches them with a smile.)

427
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,460
Yes?

428
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,329
- Take her to the corner... - Okay.

429
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,729
- and talk. - We can all talk as a group.

430
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:19,759
I...

431
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,830
- We can talk as a group. - Could you hurry?

432
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,899
- Would you like to talk? - Why don't you join us?

433
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,999
- Let's... - Well...

434
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,469
(Hye Won is flustered at the sudden turn of events.)

435
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,140
We'll leave then.

436
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,740
Shall we go to the second floor?

437
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,409
Oh, we can go upstairs? Have you...

438
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,780
- Would you like to look around? - I didn't get to go upstairs.

439
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,950
It seemed she felt awkward...

440
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,720
and uncomfortable about clearing up misunderstandings and whatnot.

441
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:45,219
I was also awkward around her,

442
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,720
so Jung Won pushed us to talk.

443
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,590
How about some small talk...

444
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,030
- at the end of the hall? Okay? - Yes. Okay.

445
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,770
This is great. A talk is long overdue for them.

446
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,299
No. It's okay.

447
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,170
What? What are you doing in our bedroom?

448
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,670
- No. Oh, I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.

449
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,980
Let's talk together. I think it will be fun.

450
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,039
- Together? - Let's talk together then.

451
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,349
- Let's talk together. - The four of us should talk.

452
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,809
- We're very close. - The four of us.

453
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,249
- Let's talk together. - We're besties.

454
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,180
(Jae Keun and Hye Won end up talking in a group.)

455
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,790
I have a question.

456
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:18,990
Why did you turn him down?

457
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,830
(Hye Won is flustered by Jung Won's blunt question.)

458
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:28,299
(I don't think I'm ready. I'm sorry.)

459
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,399
(Jae Keun was unexpectedly turned down by Hye Won.)

460
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,370
(Jae Keun was unexpectedly turned down by Hye Won.)

461
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,410
To be honest,

462
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:42,350
I thought about it about a million times.

463
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,480
Right.

464
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,680
Everyone did.

465
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,919
Of course, everyone did.

466
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,320
I have a complicated reason for it.

467
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,890
So I thought a lot about it.

468
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,900
If I were to join Palace Week with this mindset,

469
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,770
I was worried that I might ruin it for others.

470
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,070
So I didn't have the courage.

471
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,669
I now understand what you were going through then.

472
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:12,240
After hearing that, I understand your decision.

473
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:15,480
When I like someone, I give him all of my heart.

474
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,450
I was a bit torn.

475
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,960
So you had time to rethink your decision.

476
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,690
Were you able to muster up courage then?

477
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,330
(Jae Keun asks a question to know more about her feelings.)

478
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,000
Don't have her answer now.

479
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,560
- Interact with her for three days. - Okay.

480
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,799
In a way, I got this feeling that she was a genuine person.

481
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,569
There are people who would go along with it...

482
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,340
even if they didn't feel the attraction.

483
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,980
She was the most honest to herself in that very moment.

484
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,910
(The night in the single zone is in full swing.)

485
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,750
You know, I wanted to bring this up.

486
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,950
- What is it? - I wanted to bring it up earlier.

487
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,990
I got to see Female Number 19 up close.

488
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:57,720
- Female Number 19? - Yes.

489
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,890
Do you know her?

490
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,020
It was a long time ago. You guys don't know?

491
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,360
Who is she?

492
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,090
- I don't know her. - You don't?

493
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:06,700
What's your story?

494
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,200
I...

495
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:11,230
had a boyfriend whom I dated for six years.

496
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,640
I asked him out.

497
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,540
Both of our parents also met.

498
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,179
- We almost got married. - Same here.

499
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,810
I have a complicated history.

500
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,180
So we broke up.

501
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,050
She's very famous.

502
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,620
- She has a scandalous past. - Really?

503
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,220
- Really? - Yes.

504
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,630
Two of her stories were published in news articles.

505
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,030
What are they?

506
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,100
The first one...

507
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,030
has to do with a celebrity.

508
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,839
There was a scandal. And the other one...

509
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,099
(Min Dong Sung: A businessman in the cosmetics industry)

510
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,110
- is with a basketball player. - Really?

511
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:54,080
Actually, the thing is that she didn't do anything bad.

512
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,609
When she was dating him, a scandal broke out...

513
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:00,120
regarding his ex-girlfriend. So it went viral.

514
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,749
Right.

515
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,750
I see.

516
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,160
I think they read the news articles about me.

517
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,390
I think they know about me.

518
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,500
But they can't talk to me about it.

519
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,399
(Female Number 19 is Yoo Hye Won.)

520
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,070
(Really?)

521
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:18,670
(Yoo Hye Won)

522
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,900
(Shocked)

523
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:20,969
(I see.)

524
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,339
(It's her.)

525
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,209
(I was sure I had seen her from somewhere.)

526
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:25,739
(But I just couldn't place her.)

527
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,740
(Hye Won?)

528
00:23:26,741 --> 00:23:28,150
(The ex-girlfriend.)

529
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:31,550
It was quite uncomfortable.

530
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,350
If you already knew about someone's history,

531
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:38,589
but it didn't bother you or affect your feelings,

532
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,859
- it wouldn't be a problem. - Yes.

533
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,429
But if you find out about that person's history while dating,

534
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,999
your relationship might be affected by the history.

535
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,129
- It could ruin the relationship. - That's possible.

536
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:48,629
But let's say her ex-boyfriend is...

537
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,300
- so famous to the point... - Right.

538
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,700
- that everyone knows him. - Yes.

539
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,299
I'd wonder, "Will I be able to bear with it?"

540
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,439
And you'll end up comparing yourself to him.

541
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,640
And I'd wonder, "Will I be enough for her?"

542
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,040
Right.

543
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,379
(Meanwhile, the people in the couple zone head somewhere.)

544
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,219
- The couple zone. - Pull the door, please.

545
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,680
- Okay. - Yes.

546
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,589
This is where they will start preparing for their marriage.

547
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,690
That's in the couple zone.

548
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,490
The real preparation for your marriage begins here.

549
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,260
It's the communal lounge for the couple zone.

550
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:25,140
You will have consultations with various marriage experts here,

551
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,299
and you will have parties in the couple zone...

552
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,839
to confirm feelings for each other.

553
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,539
Preparations...

554
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:33,580
for your successful marriage will proceed in order.

555
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,050
(The first step: wedding photos)

556
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,220
(Joon Ho is nervous in a tuxedo.)

557
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:42,249
All right. It's the first step in preparing for their marriage.

558
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,450
It's the wedding photos.

559
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,019
We're taking wedding photos already?

560
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,090
Wedding photos?

561
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,030
That's too fast.

562
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:52,260
It's super fast and highly efficient.

563
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,760
(Everyone is nervous, but he's the most nervous one.)

564
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,000
I was very nervous.

565
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:58,770
I had never experienced this before.

566
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,200
I was wondering how she'd look in a dress.

567
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,570
His reaction will be important when she steps out.

568
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,210
I can't believe this.

569
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,720
(Si Yeon shyly enters in a dress.)

570
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,820
I thought, "Gosh, she's beautiful."

571
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,260
(The sound of his heart gets louder as he gets closer to her.)

572
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,929
My gosh. As soon as he sees her...

573
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,369
- He wants to look at her. - Yes.

574
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:30,800
But he can't turn toward her.

575
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,100
Oh, my.

576
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:37,009
Hyun Joong looked really handsome in a tuxedo.

577
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:39,480
It felt like I was dreaming.

578
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,880
It felt so surreal.

579
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,310
Look at the camera, please.

580
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:47,380
Could you slightly tilt your head toward each other?

581
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,950
Don't you think you're way in the back?

582
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,460
Should I move up a bit?

583
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,260
It wasn't easy.

584
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,460
Could you smile gently?

585
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:05,170
This one is for the lady. Could you act shy?

586
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,040
- The sound... - Sir, is that your happy face?

587
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:11,069
(Hyun Joong and Si Yeon follow the instructions.)

588
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,139
We're supposed to make sounds.

589
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,380
- Could you hold each other's hand? - Okay.

590
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,950
- Hold hands. - Our hands?

591
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,650
(Hyun Joong awkwardly extends his hand.)

592
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:20,080
He should have grabbed my hand like a man.

593
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,720
He's too... My goodness.

594
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,490
(Surprised)

595
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:28,829
(Hyun Joong is shy but happy at the same time.)

596
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,590
Could you slightly hug her from the back?

597
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,900
(They're more comfortable with physical intimacy.)

598
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,269
They make such a great couple.

599
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,440
- They look great together. Totally. - They do.

600
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,140
Great.

601
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:41,239
(Hyun Joong and Si Yeon's pictures look extremely lovely.)

602
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,270
- My gosh. - How beautiful.

603
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:44,070
I love the mood in the picture.

604
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,509
(Other couples also take their wedding pictures.)

605
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,549
Look at each other.

606
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,380
Everyone is so good-looking and pretty.

607
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,880
(They all got closer while taking photos.)

608
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:56,550
As for this couple, even their smiles look alike.

609
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,490
For some reason, it felt real.

610
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,490
I think I can do it right away.

611
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,530
I can marry her now, I mean.

612
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:06,959
(Who is the next couple waiting for the wedding photo shoot?)

613
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,270
My gosh, yes. This couple is lovey-dovey too.

614
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:12,099
- My gosh. - He's already smiling at her.

615
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,599
- She looked gorgeous and beautiful. - What is this?

616
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,169
That's it. That's the right facial expression.

617
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:17,009
Both of them are so lovey-dovey.

618
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,240
Hello, my lady.

619
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,840
(He doesn't forget to tell her.)

620
00:27:20,841 --> 00:27:21,950
- Look over here. - You look beautiful.

621
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:23,280
"You look beautiful."

622
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,419
My goodness. Seriously.

623
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,550
(Well done.)

624
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,390
- We never get sick of hearing that. - Gosh.

625
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:29,920
You look gorgeous and beautiful.

626
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,060
I'm happy.

627
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,389
In that short moment, he kept saying I looked beautiful.

628
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:39,160
So that made my heart flutter more, and I liked that.

629
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,770
Oh, right. I got you a present. I brought this for you.

630
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:47,100
I actually brought a present, so I could give it to her.

631
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,110
- Really? Medicine? - She said her throat was sore.

632
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:55,250
(Soo Min had a sore throat since Round 1.)

633
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,679
(As soon as she comes back to the waiting room...)

634
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,120
No way. He got me a present.

635
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,080
- She ought to brag right away. - He remembered it for a week.

636
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,789
- That's so sweet. - No way.

637
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,089
- That's cute. - It's cute.

638
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,989
- What is this? - You guys should get married.

639
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,190
What's my guy doing?

640
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,660
(Soo Min checks the present.)

641
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,630
What did he get you? I'm curious.

642
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,770
It's medicine.

643
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,169
How sweet.

644
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:18,170
- It's medicine? - My gosh. It's medicine.

645
00:28:18,171 --> 00:28:19,669
We're seeing a lot of medicine on our show.

646
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:20,870
We also saw the burn ointment.

647
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,340
"The medicine for lovesickness?"

648
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:26,480
It's called Love Tonic? That's so cute!

649
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,849
- "The medicine for lovesickness?" - Apparently.

650
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:31,609
Yes. It's chocolate. They're chocolate beads.

651
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,620
- Really? - This is cute.

652
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,820
He tried really hard to take good care of me.

653
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,559
I bet other couples are jealous of us.

654
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,990
(Their wedding photo shoot ends on a sweet note.)

655
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,630
(Meanwhile, what's going on in the single zone?)

656
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,500
The marriage-focused date will begin.

657
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,800
Male Number 24, Lee Sang Gyeong.

658
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,299
- I'm curious about Joo Hee... - Yes.

659
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,599
And Sang Gyeong's marriage-focused date.

660
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,670
Me too.

661
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:56,909
Yes. I chose him.

662
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:57,910
- Gosh. I did too. - My goodness.

663
00:28:57,911 --> 00:28:59,380
- I was going to recommend him too. - Yes.

664
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,550
They chose each other before.

665
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,349
They have a similar vibe.

666
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:08,120
I bet they have a lot of questions for each other.

667
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:13,389
I chose Female Number 18 Bae Joo Hee for Male Number 24 Lee Sang Gyeong.

668
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,459
(They chose Bae Joo Hee for Lee Sang Gyeong's date.)

669
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,560
I'd like to recommend her.

670
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:22,430
(Now, the two of them will go on a marriage-focused date.)

671
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:30,910
Did Male Number Seven say anything?

672
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,979
No, we didn't talk yet.

673
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,779
- Really? Right, he wouldn't know. - No. Not yet.

674
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,810
- Right. - Yes.

675
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,819
Should we reveal our names first?

676
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:42,689
Yes. My name is Lee Sang Gyeong.

677
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:43,749
- You're a Lee? - Yes.

678
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,420
Lee Sang...

679
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,820
Sang means each other, and Gyeong means to shine.

680
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,489
It means to shine each other.

681
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,560
Oh, my.

682
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,000
- The meaning is nice, isn't it? - Yes.

683
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,059
- My name isn't that cool. - Really?

684
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,330
- Yes. My name is Bae Joo Hee. - What's your name? Okay.

685
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,829
- Joo means a bead. - Yes.

686
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,670
- Hee means to wish. - Okay.

687
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,839
- Beads... - Yes.

688
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,240
- symbolize wealth. - Is that so?

689
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:06,940
So your name means to wish for wealth?

690
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,250
I see.

691
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,949
What's your date of birth?

692
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:13,079
I was born on August 21, 1993.

693
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,649
- I was shocked to hear the year. - Gosh.

694
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:15,949
Why? Did I seem much older than that?

695
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:19,089
I didn't think you were much older, per se.

696
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,990
- Okay. - You look mature for your age.

697
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,529
- I see. That's a nice word. - You resemble Byun Yo Han.

698
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:25,600
I see.

699
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,230
Hello.

700
00:30:27,231 --> 00:30:28,669
(Joo Hee saw Sang Gyeong in the single zone.)

701
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,970
- He resembles Byun Yo Han. - Byun Yo Han?

702
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,900
Byun Yo Han? No, he doesn't.

703
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,770
She said you resemble Byun Yo Han.

704
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,109
- We talked about that earlier. - That's because I'm funny.

705
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,980
That's why she said that. It's because I'm funny.

706
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:41,380
My ideal type is a funny guy. I like funny men.

707
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:42,780
Is that so?

708
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,950
(She suddenly shares her ideal type.)

709
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,119
Your height and weight.

710
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,889
I see. My height is 186cm.

711
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:50,790
I heard it earlier. It's 186cm.

712
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:54,559
- What's your height, Sang Gyeong? - It's 186cm.

713
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,360
- My gosh. - He's 186cm tall?

714
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,230
- Good for him. - He's so tall.

715
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,860
- It's 186cm. Why are you so tall? - Yes.

716
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:06,370
So what do your parents do?

717
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:08,570
My father is an architect.

718
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,970
My father is an ophthalmologist.

719
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,110
I have to get my eye surgery.

720
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,149
I got the LASEK done.

721
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,180
- You did? - Yes.

722
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,249
- So he let his son get one too. - Yes.

723
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:21,550
- Then I'm willing to get it too. - My father did it for me.

724
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,450
- You can come by. - I'll be there.

725
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,760
Won't it be better if things work out and then you come by?

726
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:27,690
- Right? - Yes.

727
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,000
Over there... What was that?

728
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,300
When you're in the couple zone,

729
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,429
you have to take wedding photos. When I saw that,

730
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,899
I was so shocked.

731
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,439
- I don't think I can do that. - So...

732
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,539
But think about how you felt then.

733
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:48,479
You still chose to go to the couple zone.

734
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,710
So have your feelings changed since then?

735
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,750
- Now? No. - Yes.

736
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,819
My feelings are the same.

737
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:57,250
She didn't come to the couple zone, but your feelings didn't change.

738
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,960
- No way. That's so cool. - That's cool.

739
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,420
That's so cool.

740
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:05,600
I'm a calm person without a lot of mood swings.

741
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,500
So that might be partially why.

742
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,669
We ought to date someone like him.

743
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:12,000
- Right. You're a great guy. - Yes.

744
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,470
I guess so.

745
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:18,110
I want to meet someone like me too.

746
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,310
- And... - annual salary.

747
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,549
Yes. I wrote down 150,000 dollars.

748
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,580
Okay.

749
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,819
As for my assets, I should have about 200,000 dollars in cash.

750
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,520
Why do you have so much? Good for you.

751
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,529
Matrimonial home? Buy an old apartment unit...

752
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:38,130
and renovate the unit.

753
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,529
That's the cheapest plan.

754
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:41,929
I can work harder and buy a newly built unit.

755
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:43,030
A newly built unit?

756
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,169
There's no limit on the price.

757
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:47,140
It can go over one million dollars. I own a commercial building too.

758
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,840
He also owns a commercial building.

759
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,370
His annual salary is high.

760
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:54,379
The end goal here isn't to date. It's to get married.

761
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,909
She might find Sang Gyeong...

762
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,409
- That's possible. - more suitable.

763
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,450
(She might find Sang Gyeong more suitable.)

764
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,819
So he and I decided...

765
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,019
- not to stay in the couple zone. - Yes.

766
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,150
That's why...

767
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,959
I wanted to take a moment, so he could explain what happened.

768
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,760
Even if he didn't do that, I wanted us to talk.

769
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,159
But we ended up not talking at all.

770
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,429
But you agreed to talk more in the single zone, right?

771
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:15,530
(Jin Ju feels insecure about her relationship with Sang Gyeong.)

772
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,729
I feel uneasy.

773
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:19,799
Up until Palace Week, I was at ease.

774
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,510
I'm a bit confused.

775
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:26,380
Right. It must bother her a lot.

776
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,539
Hello.

777
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,580
- You're back. - Why do you sound so tired?

778
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:31,710
(Sighing)

779
00:33:31,711 --> 00:33:33,949
Why do you look so drained? Was it tough?

780
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,220
- No. - What is it?

781
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,519
He's much better than I thought.

782
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,489
- You're confused. Who was it? - What?

783
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:41,020
- Who was it? - Who?

784
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,559
It was her partner.

785
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,159
It was her partner. Male Number 24.

786
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,399
- Male Number 24. - The funny guy?

787
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,730
- Yes. - Is he really funny?

788
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:51,369
Yes. But how should I put it?

789
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:53,899
- I wouldn't say he's hilarious. - He's so funny.

790
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,710
- Right. Everyone said he was funny. - It's the way he talks.

791
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,140
Isn't he really funny?

792
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,579
- He's so funny. - He laughs a lot.

793
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,339
(Jin Ju doesn't look happy to talk about Sang Gyeong.)

794
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,710
- Who was your partner? - It was Male Number Seven.

795
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,380
I see. Male Number Seven.

796
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,819
- So... - Who...

797
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:11,920
(Her sense of insecurity won't go away.)

798
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,129
Did you explain to Male Number Seven...

799
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:18,060
why you didn't choose the couple zone?

800
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,929
I did. But just now...

801
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:22,029
Are you compatible with him too?

802
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,629
(Are you compatible with him too?)

803
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,670
Yes.

804
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:29,070
We're so compatible.

805
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:32,710
(Joo Hee's comments keep bothering Jin Ju.)

806
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:35,179
But that's bound to happen.

807
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,249
When I was filling out the card, that's what I thought too.

808
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,680
- Really? - With Male Number 24.

809
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:43,049
So I even wished that he liked drinking...

810
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,489
or smoked.

811
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:45,990
- That crossed my mind. - Okay.

812
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:48,160
But he doesn't do either.

813
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,289
- You want him to do those things? - Yes.

814
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:52,159
Why? So you can focus on Male Number Seven?

815
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,160
Yes.

816
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:57,300
When I talked to Male Number Seven, I could tell he was a great guy.

817
00:34:58,370 --> 00:34:59,470
This is so tough.

818
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,840
Just follow your heart.

819
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:05,840
Both of them...

820
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,580
Once I have eyes on someone, I don't want to lose him.

821
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:11,010
I might get competitive.

822
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:14,950
I need to get him back for now.

823
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:17,090
Then four people are involved now.

824
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,519
This is a mess.

825
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,360
(The romantic relationships of the four have begun.)

826
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,890
Wait. He's back.

827
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,599
You don't have time to talk, do you?

828
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,730
- What? - You're busy.

829
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,369
- Then shall we talk? - Sounds good.

830
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:30,630
Okay. Let's sit down.

831
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,270
Can we run away upstairs?

832
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:34,340
- Upstairs? - Yes.

833
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,640
Shall we go in a bit?

834
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,140
Are you busy?

835
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,550
You are. I wanted to talk to you earlier.

836
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:44,909
I was waiting for you.

837
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,619
But you wouldn't come down from upstairs.

838
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,150
Really? I'm sorry.

839
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,920
What do you have to say for yourself?

840
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:51,690
I'm sorry.

841
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,589
I think I said hello to everyone.

842
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:57,159
- Are you uncomfortable? - I'll put a cushion behind my back.

843
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,160
All right.

844
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:00,360
Let me do it for you. It's heavy.

845
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,699
Okay.

846
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,229
(Step 2 of her efforts: Lift a heavy cushion.)

847
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,599
Earlier, when we were talking,

848
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,340
a guy said this to me.

849
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,010
"I'm good at lifting heavy things."

850
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,409
- Is that so? - He tried to charm me with that.

851
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:13,439
- Really? - Yes.

852
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,310
I was thinking, "Is he trying to one-up Sang Gyeong?"

853
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,909
I can't lift heavy things.

854
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:18,949
(Firm)

855
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:21,079
- I feel bad for Jin Ju. - This isn't easy.

856
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,080
(It's not easy to win over Sang Gyeong.)

857
00:36:22,081 --> 00:36:23,150
(Sighing)

858
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:24,450
I can't help but sigh.

859
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,419
(Something surprises the single men and women.)

860
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,989
- What is it? - It's snowing.

861
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:30,160
- It's snowing. - That's nice.

862
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:31,390
Really?

863
00:36:31,391 --> 00:36:32,700
- It's snowing. - It's snowing.

864
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:34,299
Really? Shall we go and check it out?

865
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,670
- Yes. Same here. I love snow. - I love snow.

866
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:38,429
- Really? - What? Where?

867
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,469
- Do we have to go out? - It's snowing.

868
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,699
- It's snowing. - It's snowing.

869
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,199
- It's snowing. - It is snowing.

870
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,669
- It's snowing little by little. - This is so romantic.

871
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,680
(The white snow adds a hint of romance to the single zone.)

872
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,540
Gosh, I ought to go out.

873
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,710
It's snowing?

874
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,249
(Jae Yeon stands next to Sang Gyeong.)

875
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,280
It's snowing.

876
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,550
The air feels so cool.

877
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:59,020
Do you want to go and touch the snow?

878
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:00,820
- Go and touch the snow? - Yes.

879
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,220
- Shall we? - Yes.

880
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:05,959
(The two guys walk out to the garden where the snow is piling up.)

881
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,199
My gosh, this is nice.

882
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,770
- I was getting a headache inside. - Right?

883
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,600
Jae Yeon and I became good friends in the early stages.

884
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:15,099
He and I click well.

885
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,239
We're very close.

886
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,710
Sang Gyeong has a great personality.

887
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,810
Can you pull them apart and use them as eyes?

888
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,510
- Shall we? - Yes.

889
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:26,350
This is too much. Will this be enough?

890
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,990
I even made a snowman with Jae Yeon.

891
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:33,259
It's good to be able to share a moment on an emotional level.

892
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,290
It was memorable.

893
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:37,390
- But... - But...

894
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,629
Sang Gyeong, be honest.

895
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:43,070
- Yes. What? - Who was your date?

896
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:45,470
It was Joo Hee.

897
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,110
I was certain before Palace Week.

898
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:57,750
But I'm not certain now.

899
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:01,520
(The women's lounge)

900
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,289
(Jae Yeon came to see Joo Hee right away.)

901
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:04,750
Where's Female Number 18?

902
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,559
Could you come out for a bit?

903
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,990
- Me? - Yes.

904
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:13,030
(Jae Yeon calls Joo Hee out to spend time in private.)

905
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,530
This is a really hard part.

906
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:20,040
It's hard not to be bothered.

907
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:23,470
- But I hate to pressure you. - Right.

908
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:24,740
It's really tough.

909
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:30,480
- This is so cruel. - I know.

910
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:33,080
Don't go anywhere else.

911
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,050
- Are you holding me down? - Yes.

912
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,690
- If you go away, - Yes.

913
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,630
I'll have to eat alone.

914
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:50,429
My heart softens when I hear something like that.

915
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:52,330
Do you? I want your heart to soften.

916
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:54,840
Where did you think you were going?

917
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,410
Where are you going?

918
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:59,680
- I was going to go far away. - Far away?

919
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,049
(Jae Yeon brought Joo Hee outside to show her something.)

920
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:09,219
This is so cute.

921
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,789
This one looks like a fairy, and this looks like that lion.

922
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,520
Right? Check this out.

923
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,890
- Isn't it snowing so beautifully? - It's gorgeous.

924
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,499
(They push the complications away and enjoy the snow.)

925
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,030
We'll be able to have a snowball fight tomorrow.

926
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:25,570
(What's on Joo Hee's mind?)

927
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,440
I'm torn between Number 7 and Number 24.

928
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,239
Number 24 is so funny.

929
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,310
That is the ideal type I had in mind.

930
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,710
But I came here with the mindset of getting married,

931
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:39,450
so I can't afford to fail.

932
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:42,990
I need someone who makes me feel stable.

933
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,889
Who's the one that makes you feel stable at the moment?

934
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:46,920
Number Seven.

935
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,929
We talked about our future,

936
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,660
and we were so like-minded.

937
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:56,499
I thought I'd live comfortably, stably,

938
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,600
and happily if I were to marry him.

939
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:01,100
It's such a realistic concern.

940
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:06,109
But Sang Gyeong and Jae Yeon both seem like such nice guys.

941
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:09,109
It's true that Sang Gyeong is realistically more stable...

942
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,680
- as he has more assets. - Yes.

943
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:12,649
But there's stability that comes from the person.

944
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:13,650
- That's true. - Indeed.

945
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:15,020
Someone who only has eyes for me.

946
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,219
- Hello. - Hello.

947
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,290
Hello.

948
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,920
What's this place?

949
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:22,790
Marriage is a reality.

950
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,330
They're in counseling.

951
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,259
(Financial design counseling in the couple zone)

952
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,359
Financial design?

953
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,770
I never expected to get such detailed counseling.

954
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,470
Even I haven't done that.

955
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:34,940
Really?

956
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,870
That's incredible.

957
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:41,309
Checking your income...

958
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:43,679
and details of expenditures, let's figure out...

959
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,780
how you're spending your money.

960
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:48,619
What's your average take-home pay?

961
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,290
- That's important. - It is.

962
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:52,620
- It's about 3,000 dollars. - On average.

963
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,520
On average...

964
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:00,300
I'd say it's around 30,000 dollars.

965
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,060
- Thirty thousand? - Thirty thousand?

966
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,130
- No way. - He must be so conflicted.

967
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:06,940
What's your average credit card bill?

968
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,169
Around 1,500 dollars a month.

969
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:10,240
- About 1,500 dollars on average. - Yes.

970
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:13,880
My average was 1,480 dollars.

971
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,110
- And she doesn't spend much. - You're right.

972
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:18,780
I rarely go outside.

973
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:20,420
I don't have time to spend money.

974
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,979
Oh, I see.

975
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:22,990
I realized it was a mistake.

976
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,720
This makes me look like a rogue.

977
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:32,330
Spending 1,500 dollars a month isn't so bad.

978
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,730
I was relieved.

979
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,100
There are no right or wrong answers these days.

980
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:42,500
You can either combine your finances after marriage,

981
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:46,380
or you can separately manage your finances.

982
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:48,740
- I want to combine them. - You want to combine them.

983
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:50,710
- Yes. - You should just listen to her.

984
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,620
I don't think I have a say in this.

985
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,690
Don't let her go.

986
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,690
I don't see the need to fill this out.

987
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:04,160
She's amazing.

988
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,659
We, the cheapskates, want someone like her.

989
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,130
(She's very frugal!)

990
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,700
(Ji Woong and Ha Yeon visit the financial design office next.)

991
00:42:09,701 --> 00:42:11,770
- Hello. - Welcome.

992
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:14,270
Ha Yeon is an elementary school teacher,

993
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:16,939
so there must be a huge difference between Ji Woong and her.

994
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:17,940
Right.

995
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:20,109
Suppose you're married,

996
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:21,910
and there will be countless difficulties.

997
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:23,380
One of the biggest issues is the matrimonial home.

998
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:27,480
Is there a specific type or location of your matrimonial home you'd like?

999
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,750
- Well... - I...

1000
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:34,120
What do you want from your future spouse?

1001
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,759
I don't want her to be...

1002
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,029
too glamorous or pursue such a lifestyle.

1003
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,160
I'd like her to be simple.

1004
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:44,770
I don't want her to be unique.

1005
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:47,840
I don't mind any house.

1006
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:51,670
- What about the region? - I don't mind that either.

1007
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,839
She was willing...

1008
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:57,080
to accommodate me.

1009
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,049
The most crucial thing is how much you've saved up.

1010
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:00,250
How much have you saved up?

1011
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:02,720
- Probably a million dollars. - A million?

1012
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,050
- I have about 70,000 dollars. - You have 70,000 dollars.

1013
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:07,120
What's your monthly income?

1014
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,759
On average, 3,000 dollars.

1015
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,760
- Three thousand? - Yes.

1016
00:43:09,761 --> 00:43:10,889
My annual salary is over 100,000 dollars.

1017
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:12,290
- Over 100,000 dollars. - Yes.

1018
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:13,800
You'll be able to get all kinds of loans.

1019
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,330
- I can easily get a loan. - Yes.

1020
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,300
Add a million dollars in loan to your current assets,

1021
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:20,700
and you can easily get a house over two million dollars.

1022
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,100
- I've succeeded. - Indeed.

1023
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,310
I've succeeded.

1024
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,840
She shouldn't have clapped.

1025
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:31,480
His income was on another level,

1026
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:34,880
so he seemed like someone living in a different world from mine.

1027
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:38,650
But they're ten years apart,

1028
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:41,890
so the income must differ.

1029
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:46,700
They gave us champagne.

1030
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:49,600
Take a seat.

1031
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,870
Come over here. Come, Ha Yeon.

1032
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:53,770
(Ji Woong gets playful again.)

1033
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,340
Come, Ha Yeon.

1034
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:56,770
Is she a puppy or what?

1035
00:43:57,270 --> 00:43:58,910
It's like he's calling a puppy.

1036
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:04,580
How do you pour champagne?

1037
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,049
- Champagne? - Fill it up?

1038
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:09,890
You're supposed to stand up. While doing a handstand.

1039
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:11,490
Seriously.

1040
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:15,689
The way he speaks is so unattractive.

1041
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:17,660
- It's a little... - Seriously.

1042
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,729
How many secret cards did you get?

1043
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:22,099
- You got a lot, right? - No.

1044
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,830
It was a lot, just counting the ones I heard.

1045
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:26,370
What did you hear? Tell me what you heard.

1046
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:29,300
A lot of women sent their cards to you.

1047
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:30,870
I got four cards.

1048
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:32,510
- What? - Four.

1049
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,979
It must feel nice to be popular.

1050
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:38,379
What's so nice about it? It's not like I'll marry all four of them.

1051
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:40,519
But you would if you could?

1052
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:41,620
I would if I could.

1053
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,290
Our country's legal system is holding you back.

1054
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:48,360
The other girls said that they should be villains...

1055
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,230
and take you away from me.

1056
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:53,160
So, I'm a little scared.

1057
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:57,870
Do you have anyone in mind in the single zone?

1058
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,240
No, I don't. Wait. In the single zone...

1059
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:01,699
My partner is not bad.

1060
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:04,170
But the one I like is in the couple zone.

1061
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,210
What's her job? A banker?

1062
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:10,880
I can't remember her number. I know her face, though.

1063
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:13,620
- The tall one? - Yes. The tall one.

1064
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:18,120
Who else was it?

1065
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:19,490
I think I know who it is.

1066
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:21,990
Who?

1067
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,560
Number Nine.

1068
00:45:23,561 --> 00:45:25,690
(Number 9, Oh Sin Da)

1069
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:27,030
- Number Nine? - Yes.

1070
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:30,500
She's been picking me since Round One.

1071
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,470
We're not that close, so I'm not sure.

1072
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,740
Oh Sin Da. She's Number Nine.

1073
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,140
You already memorized her name?

1074
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,410
I memorized it because it's so uncommon. Oh Sin Da.

1075
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:41,939
Sin Da.

1076
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,050
(Ha Yeon isn't so happy.)

1077
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:49,690
I knew that I'd be able to ask him out,

1078
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:51,350
so I wasn't so disappointed.

1079
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,320
Are you going to write it?

1080
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:54,860
I'm going to write Number 11.

1081
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:55,960
Really?

1082
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:57,690
I want to pick Number 11, then.

1083
00:45:58,290 --> 00:46:00,430
(The two women declare war for Ji Woong.)

1084
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,399
This is so entertaining.

1085
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,300
I've been wanting to pick him since the beginning.

1086
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:07,899
I have a clear condition for marriage in mind, right?

1087
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:08,900
(Round 3, speed date)

1088
00:46:08,901 --> 00:46:10,410
(A 2-million-dollar house? I can afford it.)

1089
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:12,370
(No way!)

1090
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:15,510
(Ji Woong earns 500,000 dollars a year and has a million dollars.)

1091
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,810
I think a war of nerves is breaking out among women.

1092
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:22,780
Did you get Number 11's card in Round Three?

1093
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:24,389
- No, I didn't. - Really?

1094
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:25,390
- Did you? - Yes.

1095
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:27,490
That's why.

1096
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,560
That's why.

1097
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,530
(I like tall women.)

1098
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:35,330
(What does it mean to dress like a woman?)

1099
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,330
(Just like you're dressed.)

1100
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:39,499
(Na Kyung found out about his feelings in Round 3.)

1101
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,940
I've gotten curious about him.

1102
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,700
I wanted to talk to him more.

1103
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:46,180
We might have to write the ones in the couple zone early.

1104
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:49,239
We'll have to talk to them before they get closer.

1105
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,979
Before they get even closer in the couple zone,

1106
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:51,980
- we have to talk to them. - You're right.

1107
00:46:51,981 --> 00:46:54,980
Yes, I'm going to make him come down.

1108
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:57,349
- You're going to pull him down? - I'll drag him down.

1109
00:46:57,350 --> 00:46:58,589
- You're so cool! - You're so cool!

1110
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:00,289
- That's so cool. - So cool.

1111
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:01,489
- As expected. - She's so cool.

1112
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:04,030
The secret date. That's the problem.

1113
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:06,930
(Na Kyung asked Ji Woong out on a secret date.)

1114
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,970
If Ji Woong and Sin Da meet up...

1115
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:13,439
Those two would be so much fun to watch.

1116
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,240
(Sin Da also asked Ji Woong out on a secret date.)

1117
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:18,709
- What are we going to... - Come in.

1118
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:22,040
(The knock breaks the peace in the couple zone.)

1119
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:23,150
Who is it?

1120
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:27,720
Poor Ha Yeon.

1121
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:30,890
(Something was delivered to their room.)

1122
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:32,220
(Exclaiming)

1123
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,560
(Ji Woong puts on a mysterious face after reading the card.)

1124
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,630
This is a bad type of dopamine.

1125
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,459
I flipped the card, and...

1126
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,999
(Kim Ji Woong, you've been invited to the party in the single zone.)

1127
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,039
it was an invitation for Ji Woong to join the party...

1128
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,070
in the single zone.

1129
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,669
(She throws the invite on the floor after reading it.)

1130
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:53,679
Wait.

1131
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,550
It's fine. I'll be back. I'll be back soon.

1132
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:00,880
Take care.

1133
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:03,620
He held my hand...

1134
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:06,860
and said, "I'll be back soon," before he left.

1135
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,630
(How does Ji Woong feel?)

1136
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,160
To be honest, I was exhilarated.

1137
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:19,070
He was exhilarated?

1138
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:20,770
I knew it.

1139
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:23,210
The single zone seems interesting.

1140
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:27,739
(The single zone party finally begins.)

1141
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:28,779
It's a party.

1142
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:29,780
Let's eat!

1143
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:31,450
This is awesome! This is awesome.

1144
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:33,879
(Various kinds of food for the party)

1145
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:36,150
- This is incredible! - Unbelievable!

1146
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:37,589
(COUPLE PALACE 2)

1147
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:39,350
(It feels like a proper party.)

1148
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:43,259
The invitation wreaked havoc in the couple zone,

1149
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:44,789
but they're having a party here.

1150
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:46,159
- Cheers! - Cheers!

1151
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,260
I'm tired.

1152
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:48,900
What about this?

1153
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,500
- Should we go watch the snow? - I'd like that.

1154
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:59,440
(Jung Won and Sin Da go on a date, leaving the party behind.)

1155
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:04,049
May I use the cool-toned lip gloss?

1156
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:06,880
(Lee Jung Won)

1157
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:08,620
Not the warm-toned one.

1158
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:12,790
(Jung Won makes Sin Da laugh with his quirky side.)

1159
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:15,490
I think things will work out between them.

1160
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:17,829
Jung Won looks chic on the outside,

1161
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:19,090
but he can be pretty cute.

1162
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,930
We look like a couple of mob bosses.

1163
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:28,440
(Jung Won and Sin Da gradually fall for each other.)

1164
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:31,110
It's snowing so much.

1165
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,449
- Goodness. - Oh, my.

1166
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:39,180
Isn't it pretty romantic?

1167
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:45,549
(They make memories on one snowy winter night.)

1168
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:47,119
(Exclaiming)

1169
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,089
It's too slippery. I almost slipped.

1170
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:50,230
Please don't swear.

1171
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:53,030
If I swear in English,

1172
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:54,900
I feel less guilty.

1173
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:00,799
(They leave traces of their memories on the snowy field.)

1174
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,970
Doesn't it look like the ocean?

1175
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:03,909
I know, right?

1176
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:07,440
(Jung Won playfully throws snow at Sin Da.)

1177
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,109
(He has an unexpected side when he only looked cold-hearted.)

1178
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:11,210
What was that?

1179
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,050
They're on a date!

1180
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:17,989
- What? - They're on a date.

1181
00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:19,650
Look!

1182
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,160
- They're in a relationship. - Who are they?

1183
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:24,290
I want to see.

1184
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,260
It's good now.

1185
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:28,860
Your eyes.

1186
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,800
What? Is this a teen movie?

1187
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:33,370
It's like a teen movie.

1188
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:34,970
- I want to see. - They're being romantic.

1189
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,210
It's "GUARDIAN!"

1190
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:42,780
It really is. On a snowy day.

1191
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:44,609
That's true love.

1192
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:46,480
- True love. - Get married!

1193
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:48,620
- After you. - Thanks.

1194
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:53,020
He was a guy with a soft spot.

1195
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:54,790
My heart fluttered.

1196
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:56,689
(The party in the single zone continues.)

1197
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:59,130
- You two look... - We already know how they feel.

1198
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,560
(They feel far more comfortable.)

1199
00:51:01,561 --> 00:51:03,430
It felt comfortable.

1200
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:07,070
It felt so nice.

1201
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:11,270
(While everyone is laughing and enjoying the party...)

1202
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:14,739
(Female Number 10, Si Yeon, )

1203
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:16,609
(arrives in the single zone.)

1204
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:17,610
It's snowing.

1205
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:19,310
- Si Yeon? - Why is she here?

1206
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:21,250
Who invited her?

1207
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,750
Right. She got a lot of votes earlier.

1208
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:28,160
(You got 5? That's so many.)

1209
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:30,159
(Si Yeon received 5 votes in the secret card, )

1210
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,060
(which is the number of men who are interested in her.)

1211
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:34,760
(Someone knocks on the door to Si Yeon and Hyun Joong's room.)

1212
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,029
I was invited to the single zone.

1213
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:38,070
(Lim Si Yeon, you've been invited to the party in the single zone.)

1214
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:40,440
Go on.

1215
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,440
I felt so bad to make him wait.

1216
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,839
But it already happened,

1217
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,910
so I said, "I'll be back," and left.

1218
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:55,819
(One of them invited Si Yeon.)

1219
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:57,549
- Welcome. - Welcome!

1220
00:51:57,550 --> 00:51:58,620
Hi!

1221
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:00,690
What brings you here?

1222
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:02,760
- I was asked to be here. - Really?

1223
00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:04,789
- Come on over. - Have a seat.

1224
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:07,130
I saw that you had a lot of tasty food over there.

1225
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,399
Come over here.

1226
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,400
(Who invited Si Yeon to the party in the single zone?)

1227
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:14,000
Was it him?

1228
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:15,840
It couldn't have been Jung Won.

1229
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:19,539
- Sit here. - Do you not know who invited you?

1230
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:20,710
But it'll be too cold.

1231
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:22,880
- You just got an invite? - You just got an invite?

1232
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:26,920
To be honest, I knew who it was.

1233
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:28,449
- Really? - Who was it?

1234
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:29,450
Who?

1235
00:52:29,451 --> 00:52:31,090
Five? Who are they?

1236
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:32,919
A couple of them must occur to you.

1237
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:33,989
Maybe one.

1238
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:35,090
- One? - Yes.

1239
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,390
He said he wanted to challenge me.

1240
00:52:37,830 --> 00:52:39,259
- Really? - Yes.

1241
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:40,630
He's pretty manly.

1242
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:45,100
(Who's the man that wants to challenge her?)

1243
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:48,499
The incredibly tall lawyer said...

1244
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,109
he wanted to challenge me.

1245
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:51,209
(The tall lawyer, Lee Jung Won)

1246
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:52,570
- Jung Won? - It was Jung Won?

1247
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:54,409
(Jung Won came to Si Yeon...)

1248
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:55,410
(in Round 3's speed date.)

1249
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:57,350
(I feel a sense of challenge.)

1250
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:58,910
(Did you say, "Challenge?")

1251
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:01,450
(Why do you like short men?)

1252
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:04,620
(You're 188cm? You're really tall.)

1253
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:08,160
The brief talk with her was fascinating.

1254
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:11,930
I got more curious to find out who she was.

1255
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:15,399
(The night deepens in the single zone party.)

1256
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,460
Is that right?

1257
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:18,669
That's not a dress, is it?

1258
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:20,470
- It's your own outfit, right? - Yes, I made this skirt.

1259
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,840
- Oh, you made it? - Yes, I made the whole outfit.

1260
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:24,770
I need proper reactions.

1261
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:27,240
I can't do it if you put me on the spot like that.

1262
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:28,610
Give me a proper one.

1263
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:32,509
(At that moment, he approaches her.)

1264
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:34,119
I might have to go home.

1265
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,380
Right.

1266
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:39,220
I thought I should give it a go.

1267
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:42,159
Is this seat...

1268
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,930
- I was sitting here. - I see.

1269
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:46,860
(The chair is way too tiny for him.)

1270
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:50,129
- Do you want to sit here? - No. That's fine.

1271
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:53,170
(This is the only chair he can use to sit next to her.)

1272
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:56,300
Where's his ambition now?

1273
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:58,670
I was like, "What?"

1274
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:03,780
What do you do on the date?

1275
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:06,180
- Sorry? - What do you two do on dates?

1276
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:07,950
- We... - Was it the couple zone?

1277
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,820
We took wedding photos.

1278
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:14,820
In a dress you made yourself?

1279
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:17,589
No, a real wedding dress.

1280
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:19,890
- A real wedding dress? - The experts came by.

1281
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:23,260
But don't you make wedding dresses?

1282
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,499
No, I don't.

1283
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,899
They're not wedding dresses?

1284
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:29,699
No, it's just this. It looks like a wedding dress.

1285
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:30,810
Oh, did you take it in this dress?

1286
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:32,610
- No, they brought wedding dresses. - Oh, the actual ones?

1287
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:33,809
Separately?

1288
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:35,079
(They don't seem to speak the same language.)

1289
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,440
Yes, the experts did.

1290
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:38,380
Am I not being clear?

1291
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,780
- The experts came. - Your words are difficult.

1292
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,920
- The experts came. - I see.

1293
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:47,460
There wouldn't be another bottle of this juice, would there?

1294
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:49,990
(Jung Won gets right up as she says it.)

1295
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,129
There's a refrigerator, but I don't see any juice.

1296
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:53,289
- Did they finish them? - They must have.

1297
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:54,559
(He looks everywhere for her only to find nothing.)

1298
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:57,330
Min Dong Sung drank all of them.

1299
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:58,830
- Who? - Min Dong Sung.

1300
00:54:58,970 --> 00:55:00,700
(Why are you bringing me up?)

1301
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:02,769
Would you like grape juice?

1302
00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:03,770
(Waving her hands)

1303
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:08,310
What did they say you'll do tomorrow in the couple zone?

1304
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:09,839
I'm not sure.

1305
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,950
- They don't tell you beforehand? - No.

1306
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:15,119
(In the end, )

1307
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,090
(she turns her back on him.)

1308
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,190
I felt that she was putting up a wall.

1309
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:23,220
So... Oh, well.

1310
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:25,960
I hope she finds a good man.

1311
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,899
What? Didn't he give up too soon?

1312
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:30,900
That's hilarious.

1313
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:33,770
I was like, "What? Me, of all people?"

1314
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:35,970
Our conversation just didn't flow.

1315
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:39,470
Those shoes...

1316
00:55:39,471 --> 00:55:41,840
Were you wearing fur slippers all day today?

1317
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,109
(Si Yeon is wearing comfy fur slippers.)

1318
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:45,310
I was wearing heels,

1319
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,479
but Male Number Four didn't seem so happy,

1320
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:49,720
so I told him that I'd wear these.

1321
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:52,490
I can at least change my shoes, right?

1322
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:54,920
I'd like that.

1323
00:55:57,130 --> 00:55:58,730
It means that she'll be back soon.

1324
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,360
Shoes.

1325
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:02,959
Maybe you can wear the hotel bathroom slippers.

1326
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:03,969
- Can I? - I...

1327
00:56:03,970 --> 00:56:06,739
want you to look your worst while you're there.

1328
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:07,770
"Worst?"

1329
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:09,800
I can never look my worst.

1330
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:13,370
I just wore comfortable slippers,

1331
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:15,140
but I said it as a joke.

1332
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:18,209
"I'll at least leave the heels here."

1333
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:19,810
"I'll wear something else."

1334
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,880
And he said, "Yes, I'd like that."

1335
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:24,749
Isn't he practically your boyfriend?

1336
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:27,059
- Oh, my gosh! - He's keeping you in check.

1337
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:28,259
He's jealous.

1338
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:29,659
- He's like a boyfriend. - It was a joke.

1339
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:30,859
(The single zone residents' hearts melt.)

1340
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:32,289
To be frank,

1341
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:34,760
after talking to all the men who welcomed me,

1342
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:38,030
I found myself thinking about Hyun Joong in the end.

1343
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:41,540
Si Yeon is the best.

1344
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,210
She has a beautiful heart.

1345
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:46,270
The text.

1346
00:56:46,510 --> 00:56:48,839
(There's an announcement at that moment.)

1347
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:49,840
What's going on?

1348
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,750
A male from the couple zone has been invited to the single zone.

1349
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:57,789
Male Number 11, Kim Ji Woong, will enter.

1350
00:56:57,790 --> 00:56:59,850
- Seriously? - No way.

1351
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:03,160
Male Number 11 is finally here.

1352
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:05,390
Ji Woong who came back from the fiery pit?

1353
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:08,729
Why is he from the fiery pit?

1354
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:10,699
He's extremely spiteful right now.

1355
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:11,870
- Why? - He is?

1356
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,499
He wants to stir things up.

1357
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:14,599
- Why? - Really?

1358
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,339
- He wants to stir things up. - But he became a couple!

1359
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:18,339
- It was before that. - He's not exactly...

1360
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:19,869
(Lee Jung Won)

1361
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:21,780
He's not exactly someone I should look out for.

1362
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:28,780
Though I feel bad for the woman who was matched with Number 11,

1363
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:33,890
I need to drag him down from the couple zone.

1364
00:57:34,490 --> 00:57:36,389
But I think Ji Woong is vulnerable enough to be dragged down.

1365
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:37,760
- He is. - He'll easily be dragged down.

1366
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:39,030
- It'll be so easy. - Yes.

1367
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:43,029
(The second guest, Ji Woong, enters.)

1368
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:44,070
Come on over!

1369
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:46,999
(The residents of the single zone passionately welcome him.)

1370
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
All right!

1371
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:49,500
This place is nicer.

1372
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:52,139
- Take a seat. - What took you so long?

1373
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:53,269
Here.

1374
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:55,040
- Who invited him? - Make him drink.

1375
00:57:55,710 --> 00:57:56,909
Who invited him?

1376
00:57:56,910 --> 00:57:58,179
- Who was it? - Who invited him?

1377
00:57:58,180 --> 00:57:59,549
- Who was it? Tell us. - Who?

1378
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:00,819
- Cheers. - Cheers.

1379
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:02,249
- Cheers. - Cheers.

1380
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:03,719
Na Kyung, you really like to drink.

1381
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:05,690
Me? I'm craving some drinks tonight.

1382
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:09,159
- We'll never get drunk today. - I'm not getting drunk today.

1383
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,260
It's very lively here.

1384
00:58:11,790 --> 00:58:13,230
I read the situation.

1385
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:18,770
(Na Kyung keeps sending a subtle look toward him.)

1386
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:20,370
Ji Woong, what time is it now?

1387
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,840
It's 11:20pm.

1388
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:29,310
(They keep making eye contact.)

1389
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:31,379
I shouldn't.

1390
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:32,380
(I shouldn't stay still.)

1391
00:58:32,381 --> 00:58:34,850
- Here, have a glass. - Have a glass.

1392
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:36,280
Of a strong one?

1393
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:38,589
- I'm a lightweight. - Ji Woong.

1394
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:39,750
Yes?

1395
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:42,060
It was securing him.

1396
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,930
Rather than understanding him, it was more about securing him.

1397
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:46,689
(They each enjoy their time in the single zone.)

1398
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:47,860
I can't eat much.

1399
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:51,530
How red is my face right now?

1400
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:53,169
- What's going on with you? - Goodness.

1401
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:54,669
(His eyes naturally follow her.)

1402
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:56,740
This place is nice. I'm waking up.

1403
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:57,870
Are you?

1404
00:59:00,310 --> 00:59:04,850
(Checking her combat look)

1405
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,549
Why are you so excited?

1406
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:12,289
- You had fun all by yourself too. - No, I didn't.

1407
00:59:12,290 --> 00:59:13,519
We really...

1408
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:16,930
Does that mean your time with her wasn't fun?

1409
00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:18,489
- No. It was fun. - Okay.

1410
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:20,460
- It was fun, but... - Okay.

1411
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:24,969
(With the woman from the couple zone)

1412
00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:27,170
But I didn't get a dopamine boost.

1413
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:31,070
Who has summoned my sleeping...

1414
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:33,779
- The one making you waver? - Are you happy or not?

1415
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:35,679
- Are you? Or not? - I feel uneasy.

1416
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:36,949
Or is it that...

1417
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:39,880
you feel uneasy because you don't know who invited you?

1418
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:43,150
Will it change depending on the person?

1419
00:59:43,450 --> 00:59:45,219
If it were you, I would've come with excitement.

1420
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:47,159
Is that so? Then come.

1421
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,660
(Is that so? Then come.)

1422
00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:50,460
(A proactive flirting that makes the palms sweaty)

1423
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:52,689
- Goodness. To make such a move? - Gosh.

1424
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:54,700
Unbelievable. What's with this place?

1425
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,760
- Then come. - Did you invite me?

1426
00:59:57,830 --> 00:59:58,830
I don't know.

1427
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:01,200
Isn't this place too energetic?

1428
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:02,770
I like Na Kyung.

1429
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,010
- Oh, hi. - Hey.

1430
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:07,080
Did you summon me?

1431
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:08,780
Got it.

1432
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:11,209
- Hi. - Hi.

1433
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:12,409
Hi.

1434
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:14,350
(Sin Da spots them.)

1435
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:15,880
What?

1436
01:00:16,350 --> 01:00:18,520
Sin Da is a second too late.

1437
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:22,259
(The two head further inside where there's no one.)

1438
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:23,290
Shall we stay here?

1439
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:25,589
What? I did summon you.

1440
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:26,630
- Really? - Yes.

1441
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:30,930
(What will they talk about in the private zone?)

1442
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:32,670
- Do you like drinking? - No.

1443
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,300
- Do you? - But you look awfully excited.

1444
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,869
Earlier, I could see all your teeth.

1445
01:00:37,870 --> 01:00:39,609
- Do you know why I was smiling? - Why?

1446
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:41,079
(Because you came.)

1447
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,339
- Because you came. - Is this how it goes?

1448
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:45,079
I saw you when you came.

1449
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:46,880
- That was why I smiled. - You're sly.

1450
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,480
You said you were going to stir things up.

1451
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,350
Shouldn't you start it?

1452
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:53,619
- Were you born in 1997? - No.

1453
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:54,620
- In 1996? - Yes.

1454
01:00:54,790 --> 01:00:55,790
I see.

1455
01:00:55,791 --> 01:00:57,590
Why? Am I too young?

1456
01:00:57,790 --> 01:01:00,090
No. Being young is... The younger...

1457
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:03,500
Right? The younger, the better in this case.

1458
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:06,769
When it comes to younger women, there's no age limit.

1459
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:07,799
Right?

1460
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,470
Are you happy that I summoned you?

1461
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,240
It's... I'm happy.

1462
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:15,580
Is it not bad, or are you happy?

1463
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:17,779
I'm happy.

1464
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:18,880
- Is that so? - Yes.

1465
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:21,719
There's not much of a thrill.

1466
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,419
True. All of us...

1467
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:25,949
- had a pair. - Yes.

1468
01:01:25,950 --> 01:01:27,160
Back then...

1469
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:29,519
(Round 3 speed date)

1470
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,960
When you gave me your card, I was really surprised.

1471
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:34,959
- How come? - It never crossed my mind.

1472
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:35,960
- Really? - Yes.

1473
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,629
(You're close to my type.)

1474
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:41,300
- You're close to my type. - Really? Since when?

1475
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:43,500
The train.

1476
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:45,769
Would you have chosen me if I had chosen you?

1477
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:47,039
- Maybe. - For real?

1478
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,140
Yes. Everything went wrong since then.

1479
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:51,010
Is that so? Then I'm at fault.

1480
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:54,979
- I'm the one at fault. - No, you're not.

1481
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:57,150
Na Kyung is very proactive.

1482
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:01,760
Na Kyung took Number 11.

1483
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:03,460
I decided to wait.

1484
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:05,929
(Another person is waiting for Ji Woong.)

1485
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:07,400
He'll be here soon, right?

1486
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:10,629
(Ji Woong is enjoying his talk with Na Kyung.)

1487
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:11,769
- What? - You can ask me more stuff.

1488
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:14,439
You're happy that I called you over, right?

1489
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:15,899
- Of course. - I rescued you...

1490
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:17,040
from that zone, right?

1491
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:18,670
It helped change the mood.

1492
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,780
Are you sure about her?

1493
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:23,980
Well, the distance also...

1494
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:26,510
- Busan? - Two things bug me.

1495
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:28,720
- The distance. - Yes?

1496
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:31,490
And the number is near the end.

1497
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:34,089
But it's not as if...

1498
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:36,989
I hate Female Number 26.

1499
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:39,189
- She's close to my type. - Right.

1500
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:41,100
I like women...

1501
01:02:41,330 --> 01:02:42,659
who are tall and friendly.

1502
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:43,700
I'm taller than her.

1503
01:02:45,370 --> 01:02:46,870
I can realize that now that you mention it.

1504
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:49,670
Talking with you made me realize...

1505
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:52,710
we're quite like-minded.

1506
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:55,110
- I prefer being here. - Right?

1507
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:57,109
When will you come?

1508
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:58,710
(When will you come to the single zone?)

1509
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:01,250
- When will you come? - Summon me.

1510
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:03,380
Do I keep summoning you?

1511
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:07,559
Can I come to the single zone if I want to?

1512
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:08,820
(Can I come to the single zone if I want to?)

1513
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:11,560
I could feel that things might work out.

1514
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:13,290
He left a big impression.

1515
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:16,129
(Jung Won and Sin Da were talking.)

1516
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:17,199
- Right? - "Right?"

1517
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,370
(Jung Won leaves for a while.)

1518
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:21,239
Jung Won was summoned.

1519
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:23,300
I thought it was my chance...

1520
01:03:23,770 --> 01:03:26,810
and looked around for Male Number 11.

1521
01:03:28,610 --> 01:03:31,309
(To find Ji Woong, )

1522
01:03:31,310 --> 01:03:32,310
(she rushes.)

1523
01:03:32,311 --> 01:03:34,480
Goodness. War has broken out.

1524
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:36,220
This is quite scary.

1525
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:38,819
She's searching everywhere.

1526
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:42,260
(Will Sin Da be able to find Ji Woong?)

1527
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:47,230
(She checks the innermost room of the single zone.)

1528
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:49,400
That scared me.

1529
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,370
- Oh, no. - Hi.

1530
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:55,669
Jung Won was outside. You two should go outside...

1531
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:56,670
Welcome.

1532
01:03:57,340 --> 01:03:59,810
Upon hearing the news that Number 11 has come...

1533
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:02,080
Why are you here? I'm talking to him right now.

1534
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,610
- Gosh. - Goodness. What a mess.

1535
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:07,750
Not right now.

1536
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:10,890
Na Kyung kept giving me the look.

1537
01:04:11,790 --> 01:04:14,420
She was saying, "I will pick him, so don't pick him."

1538
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:16,890
You get how sincere I am, right?

1539
01:04:17,290 --> 01:04:20,159
But I had already written your name.

1540
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,160
(But I had already written your name.)

1541
01:04:21,161 --> 01:04:22,560
Right.

1542
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:25,700
I've talked with both of you.

1543
01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:29,140
But either way, Ji Woong...

1544
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:30,969
didn't vote for me.

1545
01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:32,040
I did.

1546
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:33,910
When?

1547
01:04:35,410 --> 01:04:36,979
Did you vote for me this time?

1548
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:39,249
- Did you vote for her this time? - Yes. Numbers 9 and 12.

1549
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:40,479
- Really? - Yes.

1550
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,150
(Sin Da is happy that Ji Woong voted for her.)

1551
01:04:42,450 --> 01:04:45,150
The two women's war of nerves to conquer one man.

1552
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:47,420
It's a battlefield here.

1553
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:48,860
Should I leave the room?

1554
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:52,030
Since I came in while you two were on a date,

1555
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,530
I can come back later when your date is over.

1556
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:57,599
- Do as you please. - Should I leave for a minute?

1557
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:59,269
- Can you give me five minutes? - Okay.

1558
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:00,700
- Come back after five. - Okay.

1559
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:04,769
(Na Kyung leaves for a short while.)

1560
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:06,440
How long should I leave them alone?

1561
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:10,139
We haven't talked since the speed date.

1562
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:11,149
(Ji Woong and Sin Da's date starts.)

1563
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:13,450
From what I heard,

1564
01:05:13,950 --> 01:05:16,719
you two were almost settled with each other.

1565
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:17,919
With that in mind,

1566
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,390
I wasn't sure if I should...

1567
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:23,020
try to get in between you two.

1568
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:24,790
It had me thinking.

1569
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:27,059
Honestly,

1570
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:31,070
making up your mind right after...

1571
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:32,300
sharing...

1572
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,739
a few conversations is quite hard.

1573
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:38,940
- That's true. - But the ten minutes...

1574
01:05:39,210 --> 01:05:41,510
with you was very...

1575
01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:43,939
It felt like we were on the same page.

1576
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,279
We understood each other.

1577
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,449
- Our values were quite similar. - Exactly.

1578
01:05:47,450 --> 01:05:51,490
That's why you piqued my interest.

1579
01:05:51,850 --> 01:05:54,959
Also, because my condition is specific,

1580
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:59,329
I want someone with similar...

1581
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:01,600
values and abilities.

1582
01:06:01,830 --> 01:06:05,169
When I heard your condition for marriage,

1583
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:09,069
I thought it was only natural.

1584
01:06:09,070 --> 01:06:11,010
That was why I became a specialist.

1585
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:13,940
I'm more than capable.

1586
01:06:14,110 --> 01:06:16,180
For that reason, I decided...

1587
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:18,209
to drag you down...

1588
01:06:18,210 --> 01:06:20,980
from the couple zone.

1589
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:23,150
I see. Okay.

1590
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:24,850
I missed you.

1591
01:06:24,990 --> 01:06:26,390
- What? - I was...

1592
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:27,590
Me, too.

1593
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:30,519
And so...

1594
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:34,930
(Suddenly Sin Da moves next to Ji Woong.)

1595
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:36,430
I missed you.

1596
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,170
- What? - I was...

1597
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:39,370
Me, too.

1598
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,069
And so...

1599
01:06:42,070 --> 01:06:44,370
(Suddenly Sin Da moves next to Ji Woong.)

1600
01:06:44,670 --> 01:06:47,170
- Good grief. - Don't tell me...

1601
01:06:47,310 --> 01:06:50,180
And so, what was it again?

1602
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:55,319
Are you serious with the person...

1603
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:56,850
you're a couple with?

1604
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:03,789
(How does Ji Woong feel about Ha Yeon?)

1605
01:07:03,790 --> 01:07:05,660
(Are you serious with Ha Yeon?)

1606
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:16,940
I think there's a possibility of us breaking up.

1607
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:19,969
Based solely on your values...

1608
01:07:19,970 --> 01:07:24,450
and who you're drawn to,

1609
01:07:24,810 --> 01:07:26,480
who's your first choice?

1610
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:30,850
Based on my values and who I'm drawn to?

1611
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:36,490
I asked as I didn't want to waste my time and energy...

1612
01:07:36,590 --> 01:07:39,330
on someone with zero possibility.

1613
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:45,530
In that aspect, you're the only one.

1614
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:47,870
That's good to know.

1615
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:50,469
He'll go to the single zone.

1616
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:52,510
(Where will Ji Woong's heart end up?)

1617
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:59,179
(After all the schedule, )

1618
01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:01,880
(Ha Yeon has returned to her room first.)

1619
01:08:03,820 --> 01:08:04,820
Thank you.

1620
01:08:04,821 --> 01:08:06,349
- Are they sharing a room? - Oh, no.

1621
01:08:06,350 --> 01:08:08,920
(Ha Yeon and Sin Da have become roommates.)

1622
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:10,560
(Chaos is to be expected in the single zone.)

1623
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:11,730
Hi.

1624
01:08:11,830 --> 01:08:14,029
(What? I don't know what to do.)

1625
01:08:14,030 --> 01:08:15,429
(Whether you sink or swim, go!)

1626
01:08:15,430 --> 01:08:17,299
(Do you have inner double eyelids?)

1627
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:18,799
(I like you who have inner double eyelids.)

1628
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:19,800
(Is that so?)

1629
01:08:19,801 --> 01:08:21,339
(It was annoying.)

1630
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:22,669
(Seriously.)

1631
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:24,270
(I felt betrayed.)

1632
01:08:25,070 --> 01:08:26,239
(Are we going to meet your brother?)

1633
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:27,240
(Yes.)

1634
01:08:27,241 --> 01:08:29,040
(I suddenly lost my appetite.)

1635
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:30,980
(The Time of Verification is waiting for Ji Woong.)

1636
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:33,279
(Si Yeon is nervous before meeting the parents.)

1637
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:34,319
(My parents are easygoing.)

1638
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:37,120
(My parents are easygoing to me, too.)

1639
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:38,520
(Dig in, child.)

1640
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:40,050
(Meeting the parents is tough.)

1641
01:08:40,150 --> 01:08:42,690
(What do you find favorable about me, Jin Ju?)

1642
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:44,790
(Actively looking for a husband in the single zone)

1643
01:08:44,890 --> 01:08:46,030
(I will treat you the best.)

1644
01:08:46,230 --> 01:08:47,859
(He's a man of action.)

1645
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:48,929
(A man like him...)

1646
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:50,130
(is reliable.)

1647
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:52,730
(A new couple has been born!)

1648
01:08:52,830 --> 01:08:54,340
(Which couple...)

1649
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:57,840
(grabbed everyone's attention?)
