00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:12,919
(COUPLE PALACE 2)

2
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:14,618
(The reason to get married)

3
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:16,449
I need a family.

4
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,788
When I enter the dark house after work,

5
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:23,029
it feels so lonely, and I hate that chill.

6
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,828
I'm now ready to raise a baby.

7
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:28,369
That's why I want to get married.

8
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:32,599
I can't say that I won't get lonely when I age.

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,008
Get married and make my own family.

10
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:38,240
That's my goal in life.

11
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:43,179
Look at my face in the mirror

12
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:47,320
(Male Number 30's dance for love.)

13
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:49,148
I prepared Bo-chan.

14
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:50,189
Shin-chan.

15
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:56,130
Let's play together.

16
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:58,359
Let's get something to eat.

17
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,299
Do you have a lookalike?

18
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:02,270
Roy Kim the singer.

19
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,199
(Mimicking Roy Kim)

20
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,010
Heize and Chungha.

21
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:11,280
I don't know why, but people say...

22
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:13,179
I look like IU.

23
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,409
(IU?)

24
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,120
(Let's enlarge what's nice.)

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,019
(He has the strength to protect his future spouse.)

26
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,048
(Presenting themselves for marriage)

27
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:24,089
(But no one's found the one yet.)

28
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,060
There's not that many left.

29
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,958
What if I don't get to go on a date?

30
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:28,959
(Worried)

31
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,458
What if we remain here forever?

32
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:31,459
(Will they be able to go on a date?)

33
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:32,459
No.

34
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:34,729
(Waiting for the next train)

35
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,128
No one left from here.

36
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:38,370
This floor has the most people.

37
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:40,438
I liked him.

38
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,068
The one who didn't want to carry heavy stuff.

39
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:43,738
- He wasn't so bad. - Right?

40
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:45,279
- We're the same. - We're in trouble.

41
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,400
(Their ideal types overlap.)

42
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:49,908
I have expectations about marriage.

43
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:53,149
Since I was young, I wanted to find the one fast...

44
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,149
and make my own family.

45
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,358
In the past, I weighed about 70kg.

46
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:00,958
Because I'm tall and big-boned,

47
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,760
I looked too masculine when I gained weight.

48
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,569
So I wasn't so popular.

49
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:11,799
I'm here to find someone...

50
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,300
I want to marry.

51
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:16,739
The next train is arriving.

52
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,860
(What about the next train?)

53
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,310
(Doctors)

54
00:02:19,311 --> 00:02:20,680
- Doctors. - Yes.

55
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,279
Oh, doctors.

56
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,749
- The ultimate occupation. - It's the ultimate occupation.

57
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,819
Doctors.

58
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:30,960
This train brought Male Number 7 and Number 11.

59
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,120
Good. Start picking.

60
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:34,530
Start picking.

61
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:39,330
(Picking faster than any other trains)

62
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,829
Look how the number's going up.

63
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,228
I knew it.

64
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:44,668
Their occupation is the only thing they know,

65
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:45,999
yet they're voting.

66
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,210
What kind of doctor?

67
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,938
- What kind of doctor? - What kind of doctor?

68
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:52,110
Now, let's look at their condition for marriage.

69
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,348
(I want to sell fruits in my 60s. Don't express your love.)

70
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:56,509
- Okay. - "Don't express your love?"

71
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,318
- How can you not express love? - That's wrong.

72
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,419
Nope.

73
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,418
- What? - That's unique.

74
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:03,659
- Wait a minute. - What?

75
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:05,188
- Then why would you date? - Maybe he's a complete T.

76
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:07,188
- Why bother dating someone? - That's wrong.

77
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:08,929
My goodness. That's heartbreaking.

78
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:09,989
(Losing his picks)

79
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,129
It's going down immediately.

80
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:14,099
It keeps going down.

81
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:17,698
He wants to sell fruits in his 60s.

82
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:19,098
Why fruit?

83
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,609
- I know. - It's not easy to sell fruits.

84
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,138
When I was young, I lived near a marketplace.

85
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:25,809
I received a lot of love from merchants.

86
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,309
I want to share that energy with others.

87
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,619
What's your favorite fruit?

88
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,919
I like apples.

89
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:33,949
Apples are heavy.

90
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:37,258
Although he's a doctor,

91
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,918
- he seems innocent like a child. - Right.

92
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,758
- Like he'd love you exclusively. - I agree.

93
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:41,759
He seems modest.

94
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,129
Now let's take a look at their looks and qualifications.

95
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,430
Honestly, I didn't expect a lot from their looks.

96
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:51,169
However...

97
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:53,610
Male Number Seven, please come out.

98
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,709
(Number 7's walk-out song:)

99
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,009
("Beethoven Virus" by Ludwig van Beethoven)

100
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,809
He's very handsome.

101
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,479
- Oh, my. - Is he a model?

102
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:04,478
- Goodness. - He's handsome.

103
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,620
He's good-looking.

104
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,449
(Laughing)

105
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,318
He's very handsome.

106
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,319
(Her eyes widen.)

107
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,419
He's very handsome.

108
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:16,389
I picked him right away because he was my type.

109
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:22,198
Male Number Seven is an oral surgeon who's full of innocent charms.

110
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,699
- He's cute. - He's cute.

111
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:27,469
There are seven doctors in his family.

112
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,470
He comes from a family of doctors.

113
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:32,239
Women who care about the family background...

114
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,750
would love him.

115
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,549
Hello, I dream of romance.

116
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,949
I'm Male Number Seven who makes romance come true.

117
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:43,660
When I have a dream,

118
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:45,720
I do my best to make it come true.

119
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:48,829
That's what makes me happy.

120
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:52,600
As a hobby, whenever I get stressed out,

121
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,670
I head to the arcade.

122
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:55,870
That's cute.

123
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,939
There's a game called Pump It Up at the arcade.

124
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,060
I told you that it's a song from Pump It Up.

125
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,850
It's a song from the game Pump It Up.

126
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:06,910
About twice a week,

127
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:10,679
I play it for two hours consistently as a workout.

128
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,879
(Shoes for Pump It Up)

129
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:14,949
(How well does he play Pump It Up?)

130
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,688
(Flashy movement of the feet)

131
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:19,089
Ever since I got obsessed with Pump It Up,

132
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:21,129
I've been playing it continuously.

133
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,628
He must be very busy at a university hospital,

134
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:25,828
and he plays Pump It Up when he has free time.

135
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:27,970
- Isn't that just adorable? - That's cute.

136
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:30,009
His playing Pump It Up is cute.

137
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:34,110
- Gosh. - The sound of Pump It Up...

138
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,369
- The votes increased. - increased his votes.

139
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,370
(The sound of Pump It Up increased his votes.)

140
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:37,378
(10 votes)

141
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,379
He got ten votes.

142
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,479
Next is Number 11.

143
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,249
He's an impressive man.

144
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,479
- I agree. - Please come out.

145
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,761
(Male Number 11's looks and qualifications are revealed.)

146
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,188
(Number 11's walk-out song:)

147
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:48,619
("MOVIE" by JUNNY)

148
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,920
Gosh, he looks gentle.

149
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:51,490
He looks very neat.

150
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,629
When Number 11 came out,

151
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,129
I thought that he looked average.

152
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,870
But when I saw a big smile on his face,

153
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:05,338
I realized that he was totally my type.

154
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:09,069
I thought that he was cute and changed my pick.

155
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:15,180
Male Number 11 is the head of a dental clinic.

156
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:17,169
His annual salary is about 500,000 dollars.

157
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,850
He makes 500,000 dollars?

158
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,018
- Gosh, that's insane. - How could their salaries be...

159
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:23,589
- This is all hard to believe. - Goodness.

160
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,959
I opened my dental clinic about a year ago.

161
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:32,500
I work with about 43 employees including 8 dentists.

162
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:36,698
I'm running the clinic very well.

163
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:40,169
I just haven't figured out my marriage yet.

164
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:43,740
I plan to make an effort this year.

165
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,410
Hello, I'm Number 11.

166
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:50,079
I like affectionate gestures.

167
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:53,749
Number Seven who showed off...

168
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,888
his charm with Pump It Up.

169
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:58,119
He received interest from ten women.

170
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,219
Right.

171
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,559
Do you have hobbies other than Pump It Up?

172
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,688
I love traveling,

173
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,300
especially backpacking.

174
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:09,099
I met someone nice during a backpacking trip.

175
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,540
In the past...

176
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:13,970
In the past...

177
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,739
(In the past with someone nice?)

178
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,110
- Hold on. - A place I went to...

179
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:21,479
(Laughing)

180
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,309
- No. - Is it not what I think?

181
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,550
- It's all right. - Okay.

182
00:07:24,649 --> 00:07:25,680
He met someone nice?

183
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,119
I went to a guesthouse.

184
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,388
- Yes? - The owner recommended me...

185
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:33,688
to work at his guesthouse for two months.

186
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:35,028
The person you met isn't what we thought.

187
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:36,289
- Is that so? - I see.

188
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,999
I was afraid that he'd say something unnecessary.

189
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,120
(I was scared for a minute.)

190
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
(Changing her pick)

191
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:42,568
- Her light changed. - It changed.

192
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:44,175
Number 18, did you just turn on the light?

193
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,838
- I changed my pick. - You did?

194
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:47,359
- From which number? - You changed it?

195
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:49,069
From Number 11.

196
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,950
- You changed from Number 11? - From Number 11.

197
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:53,079
From "don't express your affection..."

198
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,648
(Backpacking)

199
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:55,889
She picked backpacking instead.

200
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:58,449
I'm quite fickle.

201
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,278
Do I seem like a doctor fanatic?

202
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,290
No.

203
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:05,419
Please pick the one whom you'd like to date.

204
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,389
We're given five seconds to decide.

205
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:11,929
During that time, I became very careful...

206
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,759
while considering marriage.

207
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:15,769
Five, four...

208
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:18,439
I still couldn't decide. "Should I change?"

209
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,039
"Should I change or not?"

210
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,208
I thought about it until the end.

211
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:24,279
- Three, two, - Three, two,

212
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,379
- one. - one.

213
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,180
Your time is up.

214
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:29,508
(Number 7:9 votes)

215
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,680
(Number 11:5 votes)

216
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:31,919
Your time is up.

217
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,320
(She picks Male Number 7.)

218
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,190
After thinking about it, I went with it.

219
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,190
I picked Number Seven.

220
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:42,189
As a result, Number Seven received the highest number,

221
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,730
nine votes.

222
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,199
- Nine votes? - That's a lot.

223
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,200
Yes, it's a lot.

224
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,969
Fruit, backpacking...

225
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:48,970
- and Pump It Up. - Pump It Up.

226
00:08:48,971 --> 00:08:51,039
These are very romantic.

227
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:52,769
- Innocence. - Right.

228
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,639
Please choose your first pick.

229
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,409
I'm curious.

230
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:59,940
Whom will he pick?

231
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:05,119
Someone I had in mind based on the first impression...

232
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,490
picked me, which was fascinating.

233
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,459
I feel better about her than even when I first saw her.

234
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,860
(He looks at one person and stops.)

235
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,860
I think you have hope.

236
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,960
- Me? - Yes.

237
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,960
I don't think so.

238
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:24,500
I will pick Number 18.

239
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:25,799
Me?

240
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:29,239
His 1st pick is Number 18.

241
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,080
Congratulations.

242
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:32,678
I was really surprised.

243
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:35,080
He came while looking this way.

244
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,350
I thought that he'd pick her.

245
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,418
I told her that it'd be her,

246
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:41,049
but he picked me instead.

247
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,360
(Male Number 7 and Female Number 18 are matched.)

248
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:49,529
I tend to trust my feelings.

249
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:51,860
(30 seconds to fall in love at 1st sight)

250
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,600
(He noticed her at first sight.)

251
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,699
It was her based on my first impression.

252
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,020
(My pick was Female Number 18 based on my 1st impression.)

253
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,379
(Male 7 and Female 18 go on a 1-on-1 date.)

254
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,350
- How tall are you? - I'm 171cm tall.

255
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:10,210
What's your occupation?

256
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:11,950
I'm a pharmacist.

257
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:17,490
It would be nice to work in similar fields.

258
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,690
I graduated this year. It's my first year working.

259
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:22,389
I'm just a beginner.

260
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,100
I don't know anything.

261
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,920
We're probably on the same level.

262
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:27,029
(A cute couple of beginner doctor and pharmacist)

263
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,268
(Chirping)

264
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:30,840
Now, the subject is money.

265
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,268
(Annual salary)

266
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:35,569
- "Annual salary?" - We both started working.

267
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,980
Right. I make about 70,000 dollars a year.

268
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,679
How about your assets?

269
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,210
- Assets? - Yes.

270
00:10:41,211 --> 00:10:43,649
I don't have much since it's my first year.

271
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:44,980
Me neither.

272
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,320
I mostly spend on paying off my tuition.

273
00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:51,635
Is it a loan on living expenses?

274
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:54,330
The interest rate is smaller. I also borrowed from my parents.

275
00:10:56,129 --> 00:10:57,629
Your assets will increase soon.

276
00:10:58,629 --> 00:11:00,529
Assets aren't important.

277
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,769
- Oh, we have to do this. - Right.

278
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,740
"I hope that you'll do this while sitting."

279
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,710
It's different for women and men.

280
00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:11,279
That's why.

281
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:16,409
My hidden condition is that I hope he'll urinate while sitting.

282
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:20,220
When men urinate while standing,

283
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:22,889
they splash it everywhere.

284
00:11:23,789 --> 00:11:24,789
I want to get it right.

285
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,758
I thought it'd be obvious.

286
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:27,759
- Really? - Yes.

287
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,159
I know.

288
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,798
"Face me?"

289
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,069
(I hope he'll face me while sitting.)

290
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,970
- Is that wrong? - You're so romantic.

291
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:38,370
(That's hilarious.)

292
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,600
"I hope he will take care of our child while sitting?"

293
00:11:40,669 --> 00:11:41,710
(Laughing)

294
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,508
"Watch you while sitting?"

295
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:44,509
(Laughing)

296
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,739
(I hope he'll watch me while sitting.)

297
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,740
Here's a letter hint.

298
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:48,879
It starts with the letter U.

299
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,278
(Goodness)

300
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:51,918
(U)

301
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,950
- Goodness. - That's strange.

302
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,190
If it starts with "U," the answer is obvious.

303
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:00,059
Don't write it down.

304
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:02,129
It looks worse written down.

305
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:04,298
(I don't know anymore.)

306
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:06,500
"Urinating while sitting down?" I see.

307
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,529
Regarding this...

308
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:10,370
(Is it impossible?)

309
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:11,668
I'm already doing it.

310
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:12,669
Really?

311
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:16,440
My family... Maybe this is too much information.

312
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,940
My entire family does it.

313
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:20,809
That is too much information.

314
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:23,378
He said that he already does it.

315
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:25,179
(Urinating while sitting)

316
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,820
Do you have any other questions?

317
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:28,549
Your ideal type?

318
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,319
- It depends on her aura. - Aura?

319
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,720
I make decisions based on her aura.

320
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,490
- Really? - Gosh.

321
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,860
- I think I made a good choice. - Thank you.

322
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,298
(Shy)

323
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:43,870
I felt more drawn to her after our conversation.

324
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,480
I have a good feeling about it.

325
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:47,299
He's handsome.

326
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,808
I pressed the heart button.

327
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:50,980
(They feel a connection.)

328
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:55,450
Actually, when the marriage conditions came up...

329
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:59,120
It was more provocative than I expected.

330
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,590
It won't be easy to decide.

331
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,918
When I saw his marriage condition, I knew that it couldn't be him.

332
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:06,990
I felt sure about it.

333
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,090
Here are their marriage conditions.

334
00:13:10,429 --> 00:13:11,429
All right.

335
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:13,100
- Hang on. - What?

336
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,200
Goodness.

337
00:13:14,201 --> 00:13:16,899
"I want a wife who will work with me in Australia."

338
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,469
- Going to Australia is demanding. - I can't go to Australia.

339
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,039
I have to stay in Korea no matter what.

340
00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:22,309
That won't work.

341
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:24,679
The number of votes for Number Eight went down.

342
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,109
Number Eight's condition is hard to meet.

343
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,349
You go to Australia after giving up your career,

344
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,149
- and you have to work there. - Right.

345
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,319
All right. Let's reveal...

346
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,990
Male Number 16's condition for marriage.

347
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,449
- My gosh. - What?

348
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,819
(Spend 8 months of the year alone.)

349
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,319
- What? - What?

350
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,959
"Spend eight months of the year alone?"

351
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,289
Spend eight months alone?

352
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:46,330
"Spend eight months of the year alone."

353
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:47,429
What?

354
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,230
You have to be alone for eight months.

355
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,298
(Sorry...)

356
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:53,669
Those eight months won't be consecutive.

357
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,209
Due to the nature of my job, I have to work abroad...

358
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,579
for 4 months and get 2 months off.

359
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,080
I guess he goes on business trips for four months.

360
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,009
(Male Number 16 walks out confidently.)

361
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,778
What was his condition for marriage?

362
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:06,419
Spending eight months of the year alone.

363
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,450
(Bowing)

364
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,759
(He shows the finger hearts nonchalantly.)

365
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:13,259
(Biting)

366
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,158
(Laughing)

367
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:16,689
This is Male Number 16.

368
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,000
The Prince of the Sea, and a chief mate.

369
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,398
I live in Busan.

370
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,500
I'm a chief mate. My name is Choi Min Kyu.

371
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,409
When you look at the night sky in the Pacific Ocean,

372
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,480
it looks truly stunning. It's filled with stars.

373
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:35,710
But looking at the stars alone makes me so lonely.

374
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:38,250
So I thought to myself, "Once I get off the ship this time,"

375
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:39,919
"I'll find a woman to marry."

376
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,190
Eight months of the year...

377
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,289
may sound long.

378
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,559
But once I work for four months,

379
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:49,729
I can give all of my attention to my beloved girlfriend...

380
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,600
for the next two months.

381
00:14:52,429 --> 00:14:54,870
He's still not getting any votes.

382
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,839
- Gosh, he's not getting any votes. - Come on.

383
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,000
Come on, vote for him.

384
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,668
Isn't his condition the most critical...

385
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:03,339
of all the ones we saw among the guys?

386
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,210
I bet dating was difficult for him because of his career.

387
00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:10,279
Unfortunately, Male Number 16 didn't get any votes.

388
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,479
But even if I were a woman,

389
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,778
I couldn't date a man who would be gone for eight months.

390
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,450
- Me neither. - I couldn't tolerate that.

391
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:19,389
Lastly, we have Male Number 29.

392
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,059
Here's his condition for marriage.

393
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:22,830
Oh, my.

394
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,329
He wants to give his mother 2,000 dollars monthly.

395
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,499
(Oh, my)

396
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,769
That's a big amount.

397
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:30,229
This train is a tough one.

398
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,499
A monthly allowance of 2,000 dollars for his mom.

399
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,039
His mother spends a lot more than me.

400
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:34,569
All right. Male Number 29...

401
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:35,869
is a good son and the wwner of an Izakaya...

402
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,678
who bought his mom a house.

403
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:40,808
He runs a popular izakaya place on Yongnidan-gil.

404
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:42,679
His annual salary is about 60,000 dollars.

405
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:46,779
He bought his mom an apartment unit worth about 300,000 dollars.

406
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,788
(A good Son and an owner of an Izakaya)

407
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:50,319
(Who bought his mom a house)

408
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,659
To succeed...

409
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:53,789
(To succeed...)

410
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:55,129
I did my best.

411
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:58,429
People told me I couldn't do it. But I did it.

412
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,129
I'll continue to succeed.

413
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:03,330
I'll make sure I stay successful and grow.

414
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,639
Thank you.

415
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,009
I turned it off.

416
00:16:09,409 --> 00:16:10,508
I would never click with him.

417
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:13,209
(He wasn't chosen by any woman after the introduction.)

418
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,349
(At that moment)

419
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,870
Wait. Someone just pressed the button.

420
00:16:16,179 --> 00:16:19,279
He didn't get any votes. I kind of felt bad.

421
00:16:20,549 --> 00:16:25,089
With the way he talked, he seemed like a kind, sweet guy.

422
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:27,518
I wanted to talk to him.

423
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,690
So I pressed the button.

424
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:32,058
Female Number One rarely presses her button.

425
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:33,928
She rarely presses her button.

426
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:34,929
- Right. - Yes.

427
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,398
- She's a cautious one. - Right.

428
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,399
Yes.

429
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,940
(Male Number 29 and Female Number 1's 1-on-1 date)

430
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:46,909
Your number is one.

431
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,119
That means you had been single the longest since your breakup.

432
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,749
- Right. - Can I ask you...

433
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,270
how long it's been since your breakup?

434
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:55,389
I...

435
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:58,190
have never dated before.

436
00:16:58,519 --> 00:16:59,558
Really?

437
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:01,529
You might think I'm lying.

438
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,689
(I see.)

439
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:04,759
I...

440
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,599
have never had a romantic relationship before.

441
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,828
I thought I'd be in a relationship when the time came.

442
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,000
But that never happened.

443
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:13,640
Dating was tough.

444
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,670
My name is Kim Hye Su.

445
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,079
I majored in viola in college.

446
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:22,548
I was too focused on my studies,

447
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:26,849
so I didn't have any time or energy to think about dating.

448
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,019
I think dating is the hardest thing.

449
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,990
I want to meet someone nice.

450
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,099
What should I ask you first?

451
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,640
- How about the annual salary? Yes. - The annual salary?

452
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,769
My annual salary...

453
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,868
- It's about 20,000 dollars. - About 20,000 dollars.

454
00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:47,399
- I see. - But it's probably...

455
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,440
- higher than that. - I see.

456
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,139
Her annual salary...

457
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,950
was lower than I expected.

458
00:17:55,579 --> 00:17:57,509
As I got older,

459
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,048
I started to think that...

460
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:02,618
it'd be nice to be in a love-based relationship...

461
00:18:02,619 --> 00:18:04,589
that could benefit both parties.

462
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:06,318
(Nodding)

463
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:08,088
So both parties could grow.

464
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:09,758
A relationship that promotes growth.

465
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:12,730
So someone who could help my restaurant.

466
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,868
(What?)

467
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:18,298
For example, she could be good at marketing.

468
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:20,899
If she's an influencer, she could promote...

469
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,369
- my restaurant. - Your restaurant.

470
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:24,808
You could play the viola at my restaurant.

471
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:26,809
(You could play the viola at my restaurant.)

472
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:30,210
- At my restaurant... - Will you pay me then?

473
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,220
She plays the viola.

474
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,449
So I told her she could play it at the restaurant.

475
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,420
Well, it could help my business.

476
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:39,058
I'm serious about this. She could play the viola.

477
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:42,029
There are musicians who play at restaurants, you know?

478
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:44,599
But she didn't take it seriously.

479
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,959
(Their final decision after the 1-on-1 date)

480
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,769
I think our conversation went well. We were laughing and chatting.

481
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,609
(Male Number 29 didn't press the heart button.)

482
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:56,170
I didn't get any butterflies.

483
00:18:57,339 --> 00:18:59,740
I think I need to come up with a new strategy.

484
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,410
(So many trains have passed by.)

485
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,578
(The last train of Round 1)

486
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:08,789
- Let's get out of here. - Let's get out of here.

487
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:10,759
- There are guys from Samsung. - Samsung.

488
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,789
I hear they have the best benefits.

489
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,490
Male Number 30. Please introduce yourself.

490
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:16,930
Hello.

491
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,930
I'm Male Number 30, the 0.1-second Son Heung Min.

492
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,369
I see the resemblance.

493
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,639
Three, two, one

494
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,068
("Plot Twist" by TWS)

495
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:30,009
(The first meeting is so hard)

496
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,880
He's good. He's cute.

497
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:34,886
(Charmed by his cuteness, she presses the button.)

498
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:36,509
I just got goosebumps.

499
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,090
(He perfectly ends his performance while showcasing his youthful side.)

500
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,089
"I want someone with a good face."

501
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:45,089
I'm curious to know what constitutes a good face.

502
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,660
Someone with round eyes,

503
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:49,189
a prominent nose,

504
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,759
and beautiful lips.

505
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,770
- He just wants pretty women. - That's...

506
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:55,470
That's it. We got it.

507
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:00,099
Do you actually know how to read faces?

508
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:01,669
I'm not an expert.

509
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:02,939
I just studied it for a bit.

510
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,039
- Really? - Yes.

511
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:06,509
- Could you analyze our faces? Yes. - How are our faces?

512
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:07,710
Jong Kook,

513
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,379
you have many layers on your face.

514
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,380
- Okay. - So...

515
00:20:11,381 --> 00:20:13,650
I could say you have the semiconductor face.

516
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,548
(MC Jong Kook with the semiconductor face)

517
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:16,829
- The semiconductor face? - Yes.

518
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,419
Isn't that the best face for Samsung?

519
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,420
- Right. - The semiconductor face.

520
00:20:19,421 --> 00:20:21,690
People with your kind of face may pester their friends.

521
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,459
(Guilty as charged)

522
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,960
Se Yoon, you have the face of a donkey.

523
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,729
(Se Yoon, the human donkey)

524
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,670
- A donkey. - You're interested in many things.

525
00:20:30,869 --> 00:20:32,640
- Right. - And you want attention.

526
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,940
And you could end up in a scandal.

527
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,480
But you won't be ruined.

528
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,240
You won't be ruined, though.

529
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,619
Lastly, we have Male Number 20.

530
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:47,118
- My gosh. - He works at Samsung.

531
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:49,088
- How could he look so handsome? - That's what I was thinking.

532
00:20:49,089 --> 00:20:50,089
I'll go for it.

533
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,788
(As he's the last one, the votes are flooding in for him.)

534
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:54,219
I'm a semiconductor architect engineer.

535
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,359
I'm Male Number 20.

536
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,630
So it'd take a year for you not to feel shy.

537
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:01,029
Does it mean your personality will suddenly change after a year?

538
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,470
- Here's how my friend described me. - Okay.

539
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:08,269
My friend told me that I became playful and energetic like a puppy.

540
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,539
Oh, my. His ears are super red.

541
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,409
I especially take a lot longer to feel comfortable around women.

542
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:14,980
So I wrote down a year.

543
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:17,509
But if we meet frequently, it might not take a year.

544
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:19,149
Thank you.

545
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,219
(They don't change their vote with the hopeful answer.)

546
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,849
It's time for your first pick.

547
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,849
Male Number 20, you can call out her number.

548
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,519
- Who will it be? - I'm curious.

549
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,659
I'm a bit shy.

550
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,890
So it's really hard.

551
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:31,289
Please pick me.

552
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:32,859
Please choose me.

553
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:36,069
(Whom will he choose?)

554
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:39,469
I'm sorry. I won't pick anyone.

555
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,710
(I'm sorry. I won't pick anyone.)

556
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:44,439
He won't pick anyone.

557
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,049
Male Number 20 gave up on picking someone.

558
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,849
Is he being shy right now?

559
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:51,949
Gosh, he really must be shy.

560
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,848
He should have walked around the stage at least.

561
00:21:53,849 --> 00:21:55,690
That must be disappointing.

562
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:59,788
The ladies who chose me were beautiful and seemed great.

563
00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:02,960
But it was difficult to pick someone just based on looks.

564
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:05,028
And I'm very shy.

565
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:06,729
So I need time.

566
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,330
(The man who needed more time has left.)

567
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:10,000
I couldn't go on a date.

568
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,338
(Empty laughter)

569
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:15,670
I got a reality check.

570
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,009
Marriage really is tough.

571
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,578
What happened?

572
00:22:20,579 --> 00:22:22,809
- All of us are still here. - Seriously.

573
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:26,019
I should have gone with the adorable guy in the beginning.

574
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,619
All right. The last train has left now.

575
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,619
A lot of women couldn't leave the studio.

576
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,190
However,

577
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:39,599
there's one last chance. It's a special chance.

578
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:40,960
(The special chance)

579
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,499
Once the speed train is over,

580
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,000
the three guys with the most votes from the ladies...

581
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,838
will get a special chance.

582
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:48,608
They can go on a special date...

583
00:22:48,609 --> 00:22:51,210
with 1 lady of their choice among the 30 women.

584
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:53,608
That wasn't in the first season.

585
00:22:53,609 --> 00:22:55,180
It's a huge benefit, isn't it?

586
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,880
However, they must pick someone different.

587
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,140
They can't pick the same woman from their 1-on-1 date.

588
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:02,549
I wonder who these three guys are.

589
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,519
I bet the singer-songwriter is in the top three.

590
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:07,358
Right. He was quite popular.

591
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:08,929
(13: CEO of an indie music record label)

592
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,930
And the guy who didn't want to carry heavy things.

593
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:12,258
- He was nice. - Yes.

594
00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:13,358
(24: Former national golfer, currently a dermatologist)

595
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:15,099
Or someone with a nice body.

596
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,730
- The one who danced. - Right.

597
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,739
You said he was nice.

598
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,499
He was really handsome.

599
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,008
Really? When you saw him up close?

600
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:24,609
When I saw him, I thought he was really handsome.

601
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,509
Let's bring in the top three.

602
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,485
I can't wait to find out who are in the top three.

603
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:30,509
Which number?

604
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:31,919
(Who are the men in the top 3 that won a special chance?)

605
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,950
What?

606
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:36,220
Really?

607
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:38,518
(9: American lawyer from Season 1)

608
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:40,720
- They haven't met all of them. - Right.

609
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,558
Male Number 24 from Train Specialists.

610
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:46,160
He won the votes with his off-the-wall charms.

611
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,798
Male Number Seven from Train Doctors.

612
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,170
The innocent oral surgeon.

613
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:52,969
Oh, no.

614
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:55,069
- Did you go on a date with him? - Oh, no.

615
00:23:55,609 --> 00:23:56,640
Really?

616
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:59,709
To be honest, I didn't feel great.

617
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,108
A part of me was worried...

618
00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:04,950
because there were so many beautiful ladies.

619
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,380
Male Number Nine from Train Elites from Abroad.

620
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,450
The American lawyer from Season One.

621
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:12,319
Male Numbers 9, 7, and 24.

622
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,419
Who's your special pick?

623
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,430
- Start. - Start.

624
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:17,866
- They're starting at the same time. - Let's see.

625
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:18,999
All right. You can show your interest.

626
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,499
- I know you're shy. - Right.

627
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,899
- But you must stand out. - Right.

628
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,460
That will get them to take an interest.

629
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,820
My gosh. What do I do? He keeps meeting my eyes.

630
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,009
He's checking out our faces.

631
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,779
- Look over here. - Look over here.

632
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,240
Look at me.

633
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,349
Female Number 23 is shooting them finger hearts.

634
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,180
There was someone I was curious about.

635
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:42,149
Appearance-wise, she was my type.

636
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:45,690
Her facial features were strong. Her face stood out.

637
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,419
If she's on the second row,

638
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,689
- you can go up - Oh, my.

639
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:49,690
Right.

640
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,258
Oh, my.

641
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:52,299
Me?

642
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:55,199
- Gosh, the American lawyer. - Thank you.

643
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,368
- Yes. - Male Number Nine...

644
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:58,439
- grabbed Female Number 25. - Male Number 9. Yes.

645
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,699
- I see. Congratulations. - They're leaving now.

646
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,769
There they go.

647
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,240
There they go.

648
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,710
Wait.

649
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:05,508
She sort of looks like the girl from Season One.

650
00:25:05,509 --> 00:25:07,039
Gosh, you're right.

651
00:25:07,579 --> 00:25:08,909
- She has a cat-like face. - Totally.

652
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:09,949
(The two of them look alike.)

653
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,480
Gosh, his type hasn't changed.

654
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,479
Female Number 25 is very beautiful.

655
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,018
She has the typical cat-like face.

656
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:17,849
I like women with cat-like faces.

657
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:23,328
Now, Male Numbers 7 and 24 remain.

658
00:25:23,329 --> 00:25:26,058
I hope one of the five girls in the top row gets chosen.

659
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:27,406
(I hope 1 of the 5 girls in the top row gets chosen.)

660
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:30,130
(They remained in their seats, unable to go on a date.)

661
00:25:31,269 --> 00:25:32,999
There he goes. He's coming to you.

662
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,868
I think he's going to the second row.

663
00:25:34,869 --> 00:25:36,940
- Will he come to us? - He's going.

664
00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:39,379
- He's going to the second row. - He's on his way.

665
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,979
- He's coming. - Is it...

666
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,078
- Is it one of the five girls? - Is it...

667
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:44,308
- Is it one of the five girls? - Is it one of the five girls?

668
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:45,949
- It's Female Number 23. - My gosh.

669
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,019
- What? Me? - Yes.

670
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,589
Here I go.

671
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,759
Female Number 23. My gosh!

672
00:25:52,089 --> 00:25:55,189
It doesn't feel great to see him leave with another girl.

673
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,588
It feels a bit bitter.

674
00:25:56,589 --> 00:25:58,598
- You know how it feels, right? - It doesn't feel great.

675
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,275
(She sees her first date leave with another woman.)

676
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:04,028
He's tall. And he has porcelain skin too.

677
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:05,868
He was gentle.

678
00:26:05,869 --> 00:26:07,740
He was a lot better than I thought.

679
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,809
But there was something that bothered me.

680
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,079
As for my condition for marriage,

681
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:17,778
I wrote down my deal breaker regarding lips.

682
00:26:17,779 --> 00:26:19,880
But he had the lips I didn't like.

683
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:23,490
(What kind of lips does she hate so much that it's a deal breaker?)

684
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:26,088
(Out of 60 men and women, )

685
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:28,359
(36 people went on a date from Round 1.)

686
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:31,489
(On the other hand, there were guys who couldn't go on a date.)

687
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,730
Is it because I'm away for eight months out of the year?

688
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,930
Or is it me? I'm not sure about that.

689
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,038
I'm a chief mate.

690
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,470
To be in a relationship, she has to accept my job.

691
00:26:41,569 --> 00:26:43,368
I'm going out to the sea to provide for our family.

692
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:44,470
Is that still a no?

693
00:26:44,509 --> 00:26:45,778
(Why do you think you didn't get any votes?)

694
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:47,240
It's because of Kim Tae Hee.

695
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,608
It's an unspoken rule that men can't bring up...

696
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:52,049
Song Hye Kyo, Jun Ji Hyun, and Kim Tae Hee.

697
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:55,249
"I want a woman who is as naturally beautiful as Kim Tae Hee."

698
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:58,920
I'm deeply reflecting on and regretting what I said.

699
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,088
They might think I'm fun.

700
00:27:01,089 --> 00:27:04,029
But I might not be the best husband material.

701
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,730
It's clear that Korean women...

702
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,900
don't like men with a mustache or a beard.

703
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:11,098
I want to talk to one person at least.

704
00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:12,399
I'll give it my all tomorrow.

705
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,920
(18: Romantic manager of a lounge bar)

706
00:27:14,869 --> 00:27:17,808
(A new day has dawned, and it's time for another date.)

707
00:27:17,809 --> 00:27:19,980
(Round 2: Speed train with ladies)

708
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,509
- I see many accomplished women. - Right.

709
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,319
I get the feeling this season's tougher than the last.

710
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:28,619
Many of them were in beauty pageants.

711
00:27:29,089 --> 00:27:30,588
Someone had the center position of a girl group.

712
00:27:30,589 --> 00:27:32,759
My gosh. Maybe we'd know her.

713
00:27:33,259 --> 00:27:35,160
- Someone is from our company. - She is.

714
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:36,559
(Entrepreneur of a pork cutlet franchise)

715
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,359
"Entrepreneur of a pork cutlet franchise."

716
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:40,059
I'm drawn to her.

717
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:42,176
What kind of pork cutlet is it? Which franchise is it?

718
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,129
It's impossible for men to turn down pork cutlets.

719
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,598
Pork cutlets are men's soul food.

720
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:48,169
I doubt there's any guy who hates pork cutlets.

721
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:50,008
It's soul food no man can hate.

722
00:27:50,009 --> 00:27:52,710
I thought I wouldn't at least starve if I were to date her.

723
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,979
Is there a keyword you're attracted to?

724
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,950
I went on a date with a lady yesterday.

725
00:27:58,109 --> 00:27:59,219
I think I know hers.

726
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,140
(Proper and adorable employee at a conglomerate)

727
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,250
You're only interested in one person, right?

728
00:28:03,619 --> 00:28:06,390
She's the only face I remember.

729
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:09,089
Which one are you attracted to?

730
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:11,005
Which keyword describes the lady you went on a date with yesterday?

731
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:13,299
I think I found her keyword.

732
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:14,959
(Pharmacist who wants to be the best wife)

733
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,469
- Tell me then. - It's a trade secret.

734
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,599
Okay.

735
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,399
A big part of me wanted to get to know her more.

736
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,239
So I just want another chance to talk to her. That's all.

737
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,279
(Will he be able to meet his first date again?)

738
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:30,078
- We're the Zero Votes Club. - We have to get it together.

739
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:31,779
We have to go on a date today.

740
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,048
We didn't get any votes. We must be more proactive.

741
00:28:33,049 --> 00:28:34,150
Right.

742
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,789
We've got nothing.

743
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,788
You should just run out.

744
00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:39,259
(Getting worked up)

745
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:42,159
If we're really desperate, why don't we extend our hand?

746
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,029
- Let's just jump down. - Let's jump down.

747
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,659
To be honest, I don't have any expectations today.

748
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,599
I got zero votes anyway.

749
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:51,400
I'm going to do everything I want now.

750
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,399
I'll vote for anyone I want.

751
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,900
I'll ask all the questions I want.

752
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:59,309
I should have a different attitude compared to yesterday's.

753
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,578
What happened is in the past now.

754
00:29:01,579 --> 00:29:03,549
The future and present are what's important.

755
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:06,618
Let's promise that at least one of us will go on a date.

756
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:07,926
(Everyone including 0 Votes Club has entered.)

757
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:10,389
We will reveal ten keywords.

758
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:11,890
- My gosh. - My goodness.

759
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:13,779
- "Cat-like faces." - I like Cat-like faces.

760
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,489
Annual salary higher than 100,000 dollars.

761
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:16,858
I like that keyword more.

762
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:18,829
I'll take the latter over the former.

763
00:29:19,099 --> 00:29:20,459
What if everyone goes for beauty pageants?

764
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,820
I think everyone will go for that.

765
00:29:22,569 --> 00:29:23,569
(Women's waiting room)

766
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:25,646
The beauty pageants will be the most sought-after keyword.

767
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:26,939
They're verified.

768
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,400
- Their looks are verified? - Yes.

769
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:30,838
I guess men like that keyword.

770
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:33,039
Cat-like faces. Lovely.

771
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:36,250
Guys mostly pay attention to women's faces.

772
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,680
This must be fun for them.

773
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,480
What if we come last?

774
00:29:39,619 --> 00:29:40,879
We're the last train.

775
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,990
- Like the closing discount. - Right.

776
00:29:43,089 --> 00:29:45,759
- Come on. - Oh, no. The closing discount?

777
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:47,459
(Men are waiting for the first train.)

778
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,660
My gosh. You know what? Wait.

779
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,689
(He spots something.)

780
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,329
- What? - He shaved.

781
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:55,058
You look much better!

782
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:56,900
Male Number 12 shaved.

783
00:29:57,299 --> 00:29:59,169
- Didn't it take a year to grow? - Yes.

784
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:01,069
I wanted to show them a variety of my charms.

785
00:30:01,269 --> 00:30:03,589
Let's not kid ourselves, you realized something yesterday.

786
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,640
(Laughing)

787
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:06,979
(Embarrassed)

788
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,879
When you stepped out, you must have felt the air.

789
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,380
"My gosh. I've got to lose my nose hair."

790
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,848
Nose hair?

791
00:30:12,849 --> 00:30:14,078
(Suddenly checking his nose hair)

792
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:16,348
Male Number 27, didn't you wear glasses yesterday?

793
00:30:16,349 --> 00:30:17,349
I did.

794
00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:18,890
You look different.

795
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:21,088
Male Number 15, you changed your hairstyle too.

796
00:30:21,089 --> 00:30:22,558
Your outfit was a bit flashy too.

797
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,859
- That's why I didn't get any votes. - I see.

798
00:30:25,029 --> 00:30:28,930
Great. Overall, everyone's looks have improved.

799
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:31,199
Timing is key to dating and marriage.

800
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,538
Press the button diligently today.

801
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:34,739
Let's get you married!

802
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,869
- Let's go. - Let's go.

803
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,940
(Let's do this.)

804
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,150
(Here comes the 1st train of Round 2.)

805
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:45,279
(Nervous)

806
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,279
I'm Female Number 15.

807
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,818
(She's posing to show her silhouette.)

808
00:30:48,819 --> 00:30:51,390
Here comes the first train.

809
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:52,558
I hope it's Train Cat-like Faces.

810
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,666
(Is it Train Cat-like Faces?)

811
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:54,690
Let's see.

812
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,130
(Train Entrepreneurs)

813
00:30:57,359 --> 00:30:59,129
- That's the most anticipated one? - Entrepreneurs?

814
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,200
That's unexpected.

815
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,630
That means they're rich.

816
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,669
When women have high annual salaries or assets,

817
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:07,000
they're considered highly qualified.

818
00:31:07,339 --> 00:31:10,940
We have Female Numbers 10, 7, and 15 for Train Entrepreneurs.

819
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:12,909
Let's reveal their faces and qualifications.

820
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:13,910
Yes.

821
00:31:13,911 --> 00:31:14,939
Female Number Seven.

822
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,008
(Revealing her face and qualifications)

823
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:18,879
She runs a pork cutlet franchise.

824
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,880
Her annual salary is about 100,000 dollars.

825
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,990
I knew it. Everyone is so accomplished.

826
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,348
Female Number 15.

827
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:25,419
(Next up is Female Number 15.)

828
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,259
She's the CEO of a hair salon in Garosu-gil.

829
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:30,129
Her annual salary is 300,000 dollars.

830
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,629
(Her annual salary is 300,000 dollars?)

831
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,499
My gosh, they all make good money.

832
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,298
Garosu-gil? My gosh, think about the rent there.

833
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:38,298
Shops in Garosu-gil go out of business fast

834
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:39,299
if you're not good.

835
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,660
- Right. They go down fast. - Yes.

836
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,838
(Directly manages 1 branch and owns 7 branches)

837
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:43,186
(Has been running the hair salon for 8 years)

838
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:46,309
Let's reveal Female Number Ten's condition for marriage.

839
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:50,450
- "I actually prefer short guys." - She actually prefers them.

840
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,849
She prefers them?

841
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,018
That's music to their ears.

842
00:31:54,019 --> 00:31:55,589
I bet she'll get a lot of votes.

843
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:58,049
He could be around my height.

844
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,818
(I wouldn't mind if he's shorter than me.)

845
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:01,288
I wouldn't mind if he's shorter than me.

846
00:32:01,289 --> 00:32:02,328
(Changing his vote right away)

847
00:32:02,329 --> 00:32:04,789
- She's getting more votes. - She's getting more votes.

848
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:07,460
My gosh. That's a huge condition.

849
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,098
- Where's my button? - Wait.

850
00:32:10,099 --> 00:32:12,139
- Can I get a button too? - No.

851
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,170
- Let go of me. - Wait. No.

852
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,410
(Let go of me. I want to vote for her too.)

853
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,739
- Let go of me. - Stop it. No.

854
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,008
My gosh, she's so beautiful.

855
00:32:21,009 --> 00:32:23,579
I love this condition.

856
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:26,720
- She likes them short. - Right. That's huge.

857
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:29,250
Whom did she go on a date with yesterday?

858
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,519
Her?

859
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:33,259
- Really? - So I'm a bit confused.

860
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:39,359
(Male Number 4 chose Female Number 10 as his 1st pick.)

861
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,858
(He found out about her preferences during their date.)

862
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:45,538
Well, if he's taller than 180cm,

863
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:47,239
I don't find him attractive.

864
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,499
(What?)

865
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,210
I was a bit flustered. I'm 179cm tall.

866
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:53,410
I'm in a bit of a dilemma.

867
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:57,150
Personally, I like men with high self-esteem.

868
00:32:57,349 --> 00:32:59,379
"She can be taller than me. I'm fine with that."

869
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:02,149
I prefer men who are confident.

870
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:03,489
So you prefer men with high self-esteem...

871
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:04,849
rather than tall height.

872
00:33:05,289 --> 00:33:07,588
(Personally, Female Number 10 seems nice.)

873
00:33:07,589 --> 00:33:10,029
Personally, Female Number Ten seems nice.

874
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:11,829
Should I press my button?

875
00:33:14,329 --> 00:33:15,929
Female Number Ten, come on out.

876
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:18,569
(Revealing Female Number 10's face and qualifications)

877
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,669
(Number 10's walk-out song: "Mmmh" by KAI)

878
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:22,309
- She's beautiful. - She's pretty.

879
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,209
(Welcoming her with applause)

880
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,808
She won first place with the first impression vote.

881
00:33:25,809 --> 00:33:26,809
Right.

882
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:29,650
She looks so lovely. My gosh.

883
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:31,848
She's a total doll.

884
00:33:31,849 --> 00:33:34,319
Men would love her.

885
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,348
Female Number Ten is...

886
00:33:36,349 --> 00:33:38,390
the CEO of a fashion company.

887
00:33:38,819 --> 00:33:41,190
Her annual income is approximately 500,000 dollars.

888
00:33:41,289 --> 00:33:43,005
- She makes 500,000 dollars? - She makes 500,000 dollars?

889
00:33:43,029 --> 00:33:44,349
She makes 500,000 dollars a year?

890
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,798
(More men pick her after hearing about her income.)

891
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,129
She's getting a lot of votes.

892
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,299
I wish I could date her.

893
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,200
Be my girlfriend.

894
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:52,970
Hello.

895
00:33:54,269 --> 00:33:56,470
I'm Number Ten,

896
00:33:56,569 --> 00:33:59,880
and I want to make your heart flutter every morning.

897
00:34:01,109 --> 00:34:02,778
For the past few years,

898
00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:05,049
I stayed up for 3 nights and slept for 3 hours...

899
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:08,480
to focus on my work.

900
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,449
I came to realize...

901
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,260
that I wanted to get married,

902
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,559
so I decided to join the show.

903
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,800
There's something unusual about me.

904
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,500
I like short men.

905
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:24,799
(I mean it.)

906
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,940
I find them comfortable, lovely,

907
00:34:28,269 --> 00:34:30,340
sexy, and cute.

908
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:33,379
If height doesn't matter to you, what qualities matter?

909
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:35,038
What do you look for in a man?

910
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,409
I think it's his tendencies.

911
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:40,819
Someone who can savor double the fun and touching moments together.

912
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,695
Would you be willing to savor the fun and touching moments...

913
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:46,518
once every year all at once?

914
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:47,618
I wonder.

915
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:49,388
He needs to sail, so...

916
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:51,229
(Please spend 8 months out of the year alone.)

917
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:53,159
We can savor them together.

918
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,500
You can do it at least twice a year, right?

919
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:57,776
- Yes, two months at a time. - Two months at a time.

920
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,869
Sorry.

921
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,070
(Disappointed)

922
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,939
You need to be busy in front of her if you're going to be.

923
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,679
She doesn't want a sailor.

924
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:07,809
- She's really popular. - Indeed.

925
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:10,779
- I'm so torn. - Right.

926
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:13,050
Should I pick her and let her decide, or...

927
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,920
- But she's far too popular. - I know.

928
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:17,819
I don't know.

929
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,690
Please make up your minds now.

930
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,360
You have five seconds.

931
00:35:22,989 --> 00:35:23,989
Five...

932
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:26,760
(I wish we could wear slippers...)

933
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:30,030
(instead of dress shoes tomorrow.)

934
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:32,519
(Male Number 4 wanted to meet her again on the last date.)

935
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,570
- Four, three... - Four, three...

936
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:37,839
(In the first impression vote, )

937
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:41,139
(I loved her smile.)

938
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,779
- Two, one. - Two, one.

939
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,785
(They've been feeling each other from the first impression vote.)

940
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:45,819
The picks...

941
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,879
(Will Male Number 4 pick her?)

942
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,480
are over.

943
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:51,349
(The picks are over.)

944
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:54,760
(Male Number 4 did not pick her.)

945
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,590
(Why didn't he?)

946
00:35:57,789 --> 00:36:02,429
She said that tall men were not her ideal type,

947
00:36:02,969 --> 00:36:04,429
so I was hesitant.

948
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,369
Take your first pick.

949
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,379
(You can select one from those who picked you or opt out.)

950
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,210
Among those who picked you,

951
00:36:16,809 --> 00:36:18,809
you can say the number...

952
00:36:19,449 --> 00:36:21,549
of the person you're interested in.

953
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,796
(Female Number 10 approaches Male Number 4.)

954
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:27,320
(She finds out that he didn't pick her.)

955
00:36:27,659 --> 00:36:28,690
This is so hard.

956
00:36:28,989 --> 00:36:30,429
- She's struggling to decide. - Yes.

957
00:36:30,829 --> 00:36:35,000
(She thinks for a long time.)

958
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:36,868
- I think she's going to opt out. - Seriously?

959
00:36:36,869 --> 00:36:37,968
- No way. - Will she?

960
00:36:37,969 --> 00:36:39,799
- Seriously? - For real?

961
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,939
I'd be surprised, then.

962
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,170
You would be.

963
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:48,139
(Male Number 4 observes her as she decides.)

964
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:52,050
(What's Female Number 10's decision?)

965
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:57,090
(She picked Male Number 23.)

966
00:36:57,219 --> 00:36:59,135
I have pretty high self-esteem, so I don't mind...

967
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:00,558
- the height difference. - Really?

968
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:03,089
- Yes. - I love that.

969
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,810
- So... - Height doesn't matter, after all.

970
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,360
You must feel...

971
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,268
I feel strange.

972
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:10,876
(He's not so satisfied with his choice and the outcome.)

973
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,368
Male Number Four seems bitter.

974
00:37:12,369 --> 00:37:15,239
(He seems to have a lot on his mind.)

975
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,869
Here comes the second train.

976
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,339
- Cat-like faces! - Cat-like faces!

977
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,348
Cat-like faces.

978
00:37:22,349 --> 00:37:23,980
- I knew it! - Great.

979
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,479
I was the most excited about the cat-like faces.

980
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,480
Cat-like faces.

981
00:37:27,481 --> 00:37:29,049
There must be some men who were waiting for this.

982
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,166
- I heard some cheers. - Yes.

983
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:32,471
Women who have cat-like faces get rapidly more popular...

984
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:34,360
among men in their 30s.

985
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,589
- Celebrities like Han Ye Seul... - Exactly.

986
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:36,828
- and Go Joon Hee. - That's right.

987
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:37,829
And Mi Joo.

988
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:39,699
Meow.

989
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:41,658
(Train Cat-like Faces is here.)

990
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:42,698
(Number 19)

991
00:37:42,699 --> 00:37:45,639
Train Cat-like Faces has Female Numbers 25 and 19.

992
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:47,099
She's here.

993
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,400
Goodness.

994
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,439
She has such a beautiful body.

995
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,078
(Number 25)

996
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:54,679
The first thing I look for is...

997
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,809
her body.

998
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,179
She looked gorgeous.

999
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,649
She's getting a lot of picks!

1000
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:00,819
(Her perfect silhouette brings numerous votes.)

1001
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,018
That's a lot of votes.

1002
00:38:02,019 --> 00:38:03,226
(She got 8 votes just with her silhouette.)

1003
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,489
Let's reveal her looks and qualifications.

1004
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,788
(She picked "4 Walls" by f(x) as her entrance song.)

1005
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:10,989
So pretty.

1006
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,800
My heart fluttered, to be honest.

1007
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,400
It felt nice to see her again.

1008
00:38:18,769 --> 00:38:20,169
She definitely has a cat-like face.

1009
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,269
Female Number 25 is...

1010
00:38:22,769 --> 00:38:24,268
a well-proportioned beauty...

1011
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:25,738
and an interpreter at a global company.

1012
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:27,779
(Working at a Korean branch of a global IT company)

1013
00:38:27,809 --> 00:38:29,679
Do you have a celebrity lookalike?

1014
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:32,179
I slightly resemble Han Ye Seul.

1015
00:38:32,949 --> 00:38:33,980
For a brief second.

1016
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,119
What are you least confident about?

1017
00:38:36,389 --> 00:38:37,389
Acting cute.

1018
00:38:38,289 --> 00:38:40,590
(She learned how to act cute from books.)

1019
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:42,630
Do you want to watch Netflix and chill?

1020
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,710
Do you want to come over for ramyeon?

1021
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:47,230
Please introduce yourself.

1022
00:38:47,699 --> 00:38:50,268
Hello, I convey emotions...

1023
00:38:50,269 --> 00:38:52,440
through language in my work.

1024
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,439
I'm Number 25, an interpreter.

1025
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,139
I also like being a host,

1026
00:38:57,239 --> 00:38:59,138
so I've worked as a Korean-English host...

1027
00:38:59,139 --> 00:39:01,039
at international events.

1028
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,279
We expected her to place sixth in popularity.

1029
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,280
That's right.

1030
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:09,190
But she gets more attractive once she starts speaking.

1031
00:39:10,289 --> 00:39:13,360
A cat strolls across...

1032
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,920
the frozen Han River.

1033
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:18,530
I've seen the female participants on standby.

1034
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:20,198
And I remember only one.

1035
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:21,199
- Her? - It's her.

1036
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,929
Her looks stood out.

1037
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,610
Let's find out Number 19's condition for marriage.

1038
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,308
(Please understand even if I give my family 3,000 dollars a month.)

1039
00:39:32,309 --> 00:39:33,309
Oh, no.

1040
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,515
That's a tough condition to accept.

1041
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:38,050
"Please understand even if I give my family 3,000 dollars a month."

1042
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:41,750
I had just started working, so I'm struggling to get by.

1043
00:39:42,489 --> 00:39:43,489
No, thanks.

1044
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:45,989
Is there a specific reason that it's 3,000 dollars?

1045
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:50,860
I'm the eldest daughter, so I need to support my parents.

1046
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:53,736
Does she mean my money or her money?

1047
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,099
- Right. - That's what matters.

1048
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:56,199
I'm curious.

1049
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,499
It's a controversial topic these days.

1050
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,399
If you're not competent enough,

1051
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,539
- it can be a huge obstacle. - True.

1052
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,939
Let's see how the outcome changes once her looks and qualifications...

1053
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,340
are revealed.

1054
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,808
Please step forward.

1055
00:40:08,809 --> 00:40:10,779
(Female Number 19's looks and qualifications)

1056
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:13,779
(She picked "Holiday" by Suzy as her entrance song.)

1057
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,849
She's stunning.

1058
00:40:14,949 --> 00:40:16,789
- She's beautiful. - My goodness.

1059
00:40:19,389 --> 00:40:22,159
She was so pretty that I was captivated by her.

1060
00:40:22,789 --> 00:40:24,360
Her looks were on another level.

1061
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,400
I even had to admire her.

1062
00:40:28,929 --> 00:40:30,500
She's so gorgeous.

1063
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:31,599
(Changing his pick)

1064
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,670
I changed my mind.

1065
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,340
She resembles Joey Wong.

1066
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:36,269
She's getting more votes.

1067
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:38,340
(Her votes keep increasing.)

1068
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,980
Hello.

1069
00:40:42,949 --> 00:40:45,349
- Gosh. - Female Number 19 is...

1070
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:48,320
a beauty model who looks like a fairy.

1071
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:51,550
Her annual income is approximately 150,000 dollars.

1072
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:55,265
She's more than capable of providing her family with 3,000 dollars.

1073
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:59,500
She's an influencer with 440,000 followers.

1074
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,840
She has 440,000 followers?

1075
00:41:02,329 --> 00:41:06,099
If they weren't sure about her because of her condition...

1076
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:07,868
but she turns out to be their type,

1077
00:41:07,869 --> 00:41:09,538
- they forget all about it. - Right.

1078
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:10,868
Once your heart flutters,

1079
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:12,239
you can't think rationally.

1080
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:14,280
I'm having a reality check.

1081
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:17,209
Reality kicks in as I figure out...

1082
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:18,480
what men like.

1083
00:41:18,579 --> 00:41:19,579
Beauty.

1084
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:23,420
She's leading now.

1085
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:25,250
Hello. I...

1086
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:29,590
have been a model since I was little.

1087
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,960
I'm working really hard.

1088
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,030
Yes.

1089
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:41,199
(Shy)

1090
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:45,710
I'm a freelance beauty model.

1091
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,539
I started when I was 23,

1092
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:50,809
so it's been about 5 to 6 years.

1093
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:54,250
My mom always asked me to make her happy...

1094
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:58,119
by being successful.

1095
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:03,389
My mom, me, and my little sister. It's just the three of us.

1096
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,299
I don't have a father,

1097
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:10,169
so I'm just an eldest daughter who's doing her best...

1098
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:11,768
to fill his shoes.

1099
00:42:11,769 --> 00:42:12,916
(I don't want my future spouse interfering with my family support.)

1100
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:13,940
How much do you give her?

1101
00:42:15,139 --> 00:42:16,139
Maybe 2,000 dollars.

1102
00:42:16,539 --> 00:42:20,940
And I pay for my sister's college tuition.

1103
00:42:21,139 --> 00:42:25,079
When I was 23, I saved up 10,000 dollars for the first time.

1104
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:28,820
But my mom asked for it, so I did.

1105
00:42:29,219 --> 00:42:33,460
I've been supporting her ever since.

1106
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:35,928
Do you believe you're the head of the household?

1107
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:37,089
Yes.

1108
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:43,099
I don't think I've ever cried in front of my family.

1109
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:47,269
I thought it was natural, so I've been living that way.

1110
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:50,440
In my late 20s,

1111
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:54,010
I started wondering, "What about me, though?"

1112
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:57,480
I thought I'd get married early.

1113
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:00,150
I wanted a stable life.

1114
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:01,949
- I see. - That and...

1115
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,819
I wanted to avoid being the breadwinner...

1116
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:06,820
when I was younger.

1117
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:10,989
Finding a good man and marrying him was...

1118
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:14,559
one of my life's dreams.

1119
00:43:16,329 --> 00:43:19,400
I'd like to ask Number 19.

1120
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:21,400
- Yes. - You support your family, right?

1121
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:23,439
Is it 3,000 dollars a month at most...

1122
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,239
or at least 3,000 dollars a month?

1123
00:43:25,809 --> 00:43:26,980
It can be flexible.

1124
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,280
Flexible.

1125
00:43:29,409 --> 00:43:30,610
The one who just asked is...

1126
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:32,110
The izakaya!

1127
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:34,949
That's right. You have a good memory.

1128
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:38,519
Number 29 is excited that she remembers him.

1129
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,190
I want to know...

1130
00:43:42,389 --> 00:43:44,690
if you're up for living abroad.

1131
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:46,730
Oh, Japan!

1132
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,230
- Do you remember? - Yes.

1133
00:43:48,429 --> 00:43:49,429
Her memory...

1134
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:51,300
It looks like she's on a quiz show.

1135
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:54,419
She was around until the end of Round One.

1136
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,769
- Japan is correct. - That's correct.

1137
00:43:57,269 --> 00:43:58,940
The men are so happy.

1138
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,480
I love Japan.

1139
00:44:01,909 --> 00:44:03,808
(So, our conditions match.)

1140
00:44:03,809 --> 00:44:05,109
- Goodness. - They don't stop asking questions.

1141
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:06,779
They don't stop in this round.

1142
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,519
Number 16. You know him, right?

1143
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,089
- Yes. - The sailor.

1144
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:11,090
Awesome.

1145
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:13,219
- Now... Number 17! - Number 17.

1146
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,289
- The bodyguard! - You're right.

1147
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:16,828
- The bodyguard. - The bodyguard?

1148
00:44:16,829 --> 00:44:19,029
- He's a private secretary. - Yes, a private secretary.

1149
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,240
- She remembers them all. - That's impressive.

1150
00:44:22,099 --> 00:44:24,300
You waited until the end yesterday.

1151
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:26,599
I was wondering why you didn't choose anyone.

1152
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:31,340
When I date someone,

1153
00:44:31,809 --> 00:44:33,738
I tend to be extremely discreet.

1154
00:44:33,739 --> 00:44:35,238
- It looks like it. - Yes.

1155
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:37,079
- She remembers all 30 of them, - Right.

1156
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,908
So she's obviously discreet.

1157
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:40,149
- She took impeccable notes. - Indeed.

1158
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:41,719
She wasn't just sitting there.

1159
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:45,519
Why does she look familiar?

1160
00:44:46,989 --> 00:44:48,919
- Oh, I remember. - Yeah?

1161
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,459
- She's Yoo Hye Won. - Right.

1162
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:51,489
- Right? - Yes.

1163
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:53,860
- Hye Won? - She's that celebrity's ex.

1164
00:44:56,429 --> 00:44:57,730
Oh, it's her!

1165
00:44:57,869 --> 00:44:59,439
I've definitely seen her before,

1166
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,038
but I wasn't sure who it was.

1167
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:03,070
- She's already known. - That's bad, right?

1168
00:45:05,239 --> 00:45:07,739
I'm not sure if I can even be here, though.

1169
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:11,149
I had some rumors.

1170
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:12,449
- Scandals? - Yes.

1171
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,420
- Those rumors... - Right.

1172
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,849
Keep haunting me, so...

1173
00:45:20,389 --> 00:45:21,559
But what can I do?

1174
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,230
I wish to meet a good partner...

1175
00:45:25,829 --> 00:45:29,000
and do my best.

1176
00:45:30,469 --> 00:45:33,000
Female Number 19, who has the most votes,

1177
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:35,670
will take her first pick.

1178
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,538
Take your first pick.

1179
00:45:37,539 --> 00:45:39,369
(Female Number 19's first pick)

1180
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:42,609
The beauty model has the right to choose now.

1181
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:45,149
Stand in front of the man you like among the nine participants...

1182
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:48,980
and call out the number of your choice.

1183
00:45:52,889 --> 00:45:56,230
Number 17 and Number 3.

1184
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:58,889
I'm torn between them.

1185
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:01,360
Oh, my gosh.

1186
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,698
(Who's her first pick?)

1187
00:46:03,699 --> 00:46:05,099
She really is discreet.

1188
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:11,138
(Female Number 19 and Male Number 3 are matched.)

1189
00:46:11,139 --> 00:46:12,210
Oh, my gosh.

1190
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:15,780
He's gone!

1191
00:46:16,349 --> 00:46:17,408
Goodbye.

1192
00:46:17,409 --> 00:46:19,479
(Goodbye.)

1193
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:23,089
I had a chat with Number 3 in Round 1.

1194
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:24,249
(Female Number 8 went on the first date with him.)

1195
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:26,360
We had so much fun.

1196
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:29,320
Though it's sad,

1197
00:46:29,989 --> 00:46:32,030
I have to say goodbye to him.

1198
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:36,199
I wanted to ask you this.

1199
00:46:36,469 --> 00:46:40,300
I voted for you, thinking you wouldn't choose me.

1200
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:43,710
I was looking around,

1201
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:46,539
and you were the one...

1202
00:46:47,809 --> 00:46:51,110
I wanted to talk to the most.

1203
00:46:51,349 --> 00:46:52,380
- Really? - Yes.

1204
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,320
- Thank you. - No problem.

1205
00:46:56,289 --> 00:46:57,949
- What's your MBTI type? - Me?

1206
00:46:58,289 --> 00:47:00,919
I have a feeling that we're similar.

1207
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,959
- You're an introvert. - Keep going.

1208
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,089
- A sensing type. - Yes.

1209
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:05,090
- A thinker? - Yes.

1210
00:47:05,091 --> 00:47:06,599
And a judging type. Right?

1211
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:09,900
You got them all wrong.

1212
00:47:10,469 --> 00:47:12,300
(Embarrassed)

1213
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,399
- Your type is ENFP? - Yes.

1214
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,840
(Male Number 3's MBTI type is ENFP.)

1215
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:19,578
And my hidden condition is, "I don't like men who are too..."

1216
00:47:19,579 --> 00:47:20,679
What could it be?

1217
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,710
- Someone who talks too much? - No.

1218
00:47:22,809 --> 00:47:24,650
I like a guy who talks a lot.

1219
00:47:24,909 --> 00:47:26,479
(What could it be, then?)

1220
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,780
He gets calls like,

1221
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:29,519
"Come outside!"

1222
00:47:29,849 --> 00:47:31,209
- Men with a lot of friends? - No.

1223
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:32,920
- Female friends. - No.

1224
00:47:33,289 --> 00:47:34,559
I really want to get it right.

1225
00:47:34,659 --> 00:47:36,158
- Men and women all... - Okay.

1226
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:38,289
- want him. - They want him?

1227
00:47:38,489 --> 00:47:40,098
- Someone who's too popular? - Yes.

1228
00:47:40,099 --> 00:47:41,760
(I don't like men who are too popular.)

1229
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,968
If he's too popular,

1230
00:47:44,969 --> 00:47:48,439
I tend to have a hard time.

1231
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,539
Have you dated a lot of popular men?

1232
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:52,939
I guess you suffered a lot from popular men.

1233
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:55,209
No. That's not it.

1234
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:56,579
(That's not it.)

1235
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:59,779
It seemed that she had a bad experience...

1236
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:02,149
from dating guys who were too popular.

1237
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:04,420
But I'm not that popular,

1238
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:07,619
so I said, "You'll be fine with me."

1239
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:10,488
I live abroad,

1240
00:48:10,489 --> 00:48:12,959
so we may have to do long-distance at the start of the relationship.

1241
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,599
I frequently visited Japan, and...

1242
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:18,769
(Nervous)

1243
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:20,800
I loved it.

1244
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:22,340
I even considered...

1245
00:48:23,309 --> 00:48:25,468
living in Japan in the future.

1246
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:26,510
Seriously?

1247
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:28,409
- Yes. - That's amazing.

1248
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:32,150
He was charming.

1249
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,948
I'd like to see him again,

1250
00:48:35,949 --> 00:48:37,249
so I pressed the heart button.

1251
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:38,589
(They have good feelings toward each other.)

1252
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:41,319
(Do you have a specific physical preference?)

1253
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,489
Physical preferences?

1254
00:48:43,159 --> 00:48:45,960
Someone with thick thighs.

1255
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:49,099
I want him to have a thick torso.

1256
00:48:49,869 --> 00:48:52,900
I'd like him to be robust on both sides.

1257
00:48:53,269 --> 00:48:55,538
Someone with a thick neck, masculine,

1258
00:48:55,539 --> 00:48:57,868
and tanned. That's what I prefer.

1259
00:48:57,869 --> 00:48:59,138
A man who's clean...

1260
00:48:59,139 --> 00:49:01,379
and keeps his nails short.

1261
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:04,480
I'm not exactly interested in women with a snaggletooth.

1262
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:06,948
People with too many misaligned teeth...

1263
00:49:06,949 --> 00:49:08,750
tend to have bad personalities.

1264
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:11,249
(The single men and women have different physical standards.)

1265
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:13,158
(Another participant's physical condition)

1266
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:15,118
"I don't like thin and petty-looking lips."

1267
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,888
"Thin and petty-looking." That sounds like physiognomy.

1268
00:49:16,889 --> 00:49:18,189
Yes, it does.

1269
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:19,999
"I don't like thin and petty-looking lips."

1270
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,600
- "Thin and petty-looking lips!" - "Thin and petty-looking lips!"

1271
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,530
"Thin and petty-looking lips?"

1272
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,039
I don't have thin and petty-looking lips.

1273
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:31,639
- Right? - Yeah.

1274
00:49:32,309 --> 00:49:33,538
- You've got sweet lips. - Yes.

1275
00:49:33,539 --> 00:49:35,038
They're not exactly thin or petty-looking.

1276
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:36,710
(Getting ready to flirt with his lips)

1277
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:38,250
Do I have thin lips?

1278
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:42,218
I don't think so. Some people have really thin lips.

1279
00:49:42,219 --> 00:49:44,050
(Are my lips good enough?)

1280
00:49:44,219 --> 00:49:46,050
(Unsure)

1281
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:50,030
(They're still confused about the thin and petty-looking lips.)

1282
00:49:50,289 --> 00:49:53,130
His lips play a huge part for me.

1283
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:55,658
I don't like lips...

1284
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:59,098
that are small, thin, and petty-looking.

1285
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:01,369
What if you find a guy that checks all the boxes...

1286
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,039
but has thin lips?

1287
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:04,538
Then, it's a no.

1288
00:50:04,539 --> 00:50:05,539
(Never.)

1289
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:07,379
(She's certain about her preference.)

1290
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:08,709
(Why is Female Number 23 obsessed with lips?)

1291
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:10,480
When we kiss...

1292
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:13,150
(He can't help but laugh.)

1293
00:50:14,449 --> 00:50:16,150
When we kiss,

1294
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:19,860
I want to be able to feel his lips.

1295
00:50:19,989 --> 00:50:21,260
I need to know they're lips.

1296
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,289
- "They're lips." - I need to know they're lips.

1297
00:50:24,989 --> 00:50:26,499
(You need to know...)

1298
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,859
(that they're lips?)

1299
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,598
(He automatically checks his lips.)

1300
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:30,869
I need to know they're lips.

1301
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,238
(Female Number 23 has a unique condition for marriage.)

1302
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:35,368
Number 23 went on a special date...

1303
00:50:35,369 --> 00:50:37,339
with Male Number 24, the dermatologist,

1304
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:38,968
in Round One.

1305
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:40,480
I bet they make a cute couple.

1306
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:45,249
My condition for marriage was that I don't like...

1307
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,780
thin and petty-looking lips.

1308
00:50:48,349 --> 00:50:51,288
(But Male Number 24 didn't pick her.)

1309
00:50:51,289 --> 00:50:54,460
First, Female Number 23, please step forward.

1310
00:50:55,019 --> 00:50:58,190
(She picked "L-O-V-E" by Natalie Cole.)

1311
00:50:58,929 --> 00:51:00,860
- She's gorgeous. - She's a queen.

1312
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:05,928
(A top-tier VIP banker with outstanding people skills)

1313
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:08,839
Female Number 23 is a VIP-dedicated banker...

1314
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,609
with outstanding people skills.

1315
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:12,709
She's the head of VIP wealth management...

1316
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:15,039
at a primary financial institution.

1317
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:18,649
There are VIP rooms at banks, right?

1318
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:20,119
In one of those private rooms,

1319
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,319
I give financial advice to VIP clients,

1320
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,018
and I'm the head of the team.

1321
00:51:25,019 --> 00:51:28,089
I hope a lot of you pick me. Thank you for listening.

1322
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:29,929
Thank you for the introduction.

1323
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:31,889
Oh, it's her. But...

1324
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:34,598
(Gulping)

1325
00:51:34,599 --> 00:51:37,070
But she said she didn't like men with thin lips.

1326
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:40,669
(I don't like thin and petty-looking lips.)

1327
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:42,339
She wrote that condition...

1328
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:44,069
after we met yesterday, right?

1329
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:45,070
So,

1330
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:48,279
I wondered if it was about me.

1331
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,480
(Is it okay if I pick her?)

1332
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:52,250
I wasn't sure about what to do.

1333
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:55,219
Yes, Number 24.

1334
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:58,749
Are my lips petty-looking?

1335
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:01,190
(Are my lips petty-looking?)

1336
00:52:01,719 --> 00:52:03,629
It must have bothered him.

1337
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:05,260
I wanted to know if they were thin.

1338
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:07,500
- Are his lips... - Please tell him.

1339
00:52:07,659 --> 00:52:09,259
How his lips look when he smiles is what matters to me.

1340
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,530
When you smile,

1341
00:52:12,469 --> 00:52:14,070
you can smile brightly.

1342
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:15,369
So, your lips are fine.

1343
00:52:16,139 --> 00:52:17,869
(A bright smile)

1344
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:21,309
I wondered if he'd pick me after seeing my condition.

1345
00:52:24,579 --> 00:52:25,609
- He pressed it! - He picked you.

1346
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:27,280
He pressed it right away.

1347
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,590
I was glad that he picked me.

1348
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:34,118
Number 23, take your first pick.

1349
00:52:34,119 --> 00:52:35,519
(Female Number 23's first pick)

1350
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:37,659
Let's go.

1351
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:39,659
- "Let's go." - Number 24!

1352
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,530
His lips got a pass!

1353
00:52:42,329 --> 00:52:44,630
- His lips got a pass! - His lips got a pass!

1354
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:46,189
- That's great. - Congratulations.

1355
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:48,399
- Congrats. - He's holding two hand warmers.

1356
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:50,710
And he hands one over to her.

1357
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:53,210
Number 24, who can't lift heavy things.

1358
00:52:54,179 --> 00:52:55,879
That hand warmer is the heaviest thing he can lift.

1359
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:56,880
Is it?

1360
00:52:56,881 --> 00:52:58,449
He barely carried it.

1361
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,780
You mentioned thin lips,

1362
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:04,320
so I wasn't sure what to do.

1363
00:53:05,619 --> 00:53:07,158
His lips looked thin to me.

1364
00:53:07,159 --> 00:53:08,718
They're obviously thin.

1365
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:10,428
His lips are thin, objectively speaking.

1366
00:53:10,429 --> 00:53:12,590
I thought his lips were the thinnest in the studio,

1367
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:14,360
but she left with him.

1368
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,029
- She did. - They left together.

1369
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:17,729
You never know how it turns out.

1370
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:19,099
Indeed.

1371
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:21,098
(Female Number 23 and Male Number 24 begin their 1-on-1 date.)

1372
00:53:21,099 --> 00:53:24,610
I was worried that you wouldn't pick me.

1373
00:53:25,239 --> 00:53:27,210
When we were leaving yesterday,

1374
00:53:27,639 --> 00:53:30,579
you said, "See you again."

1375
00:53:30,849 --> 00:53:32,010
Did you wait for me?

1376
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,650
Yes, that's right.

1377
00:53:33,949 --> 00:53:36,349
Such things came across as cute.

1378
00:53:36,619 --> 00:53:38,550
He said he waited for me.

1379
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:40,988
- I did some deep thinking. - Yes.

1380
00:53:40,989 --> 00:53:42,888
What is it that I prefer about my partner's lips?

1381
00:53:42,889 --> 00:53:44,029
(What is it that I prefer about my partner's lips?)

1382
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:46,598
I think I like it when my partner's teeth show...

1383
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:50,400
- when he smiles brightly. - I see.

1384
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:52,969
(Like this?)

1385
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:55,300
I looked at him in detail again.

1386
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,670
His eyes, nose, and lips were cute.

1387
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,579
Today was a heart.

1388
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:05,509
His eyes are really pretty.

1389
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:06,619
(Are they meant to be?)

1390
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:09,348
Let's look at her condition for marriage.

1391
00:54:09,349 --> 00:54:11,218
(Make me a housewife.)

1392
00:54:11,219 --> 00:54:12,848
(After the condition is revealed, )

1393
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:15,658
(many give up their pick.)

1394
00:54:15,659 --> 00:54:16,659
I see.

1395
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:19,090
"Make me a housewife."

1396
00:54:19,329 --> 00:54:21,098
When the husband works hard...

1397
00:54:21,099 --> 00:54:22,859
- to earn money, - Maintaining a job.

1398
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:25,099
And the wife supports him well,

1399
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:28,369
I think the family will be more peaceful.

1400
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:32,110
She has a mindset that's rare these days.

1401
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:33,239
It's very rare.

1402
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:37,908
Unfortunately, the ballet academy director received zero votes.

1403
00:54:37,909 --> 00:54:40,319
Please get on the train again.

1404
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,949
(Female Number 16 ended with 0 votes.)

1405
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:45,349
I feel misunderstood.

1406
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:50,359
(So sad)

1407
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,559
I like working.

1408
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,868
"I only want to eat delivery food."

1409
00:54:56,869 --> 00:54:57,899
What?

1410
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,198
Number 22's condition is tough.

1411
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:00,238
(Number 22's condition is tough.)

1412
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:03,569
I currently live...

1413
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:05,138
with a cute cat.

1414
00:55:05,139 --> 00:55:07,038
Want to come over to see my cat?

1415
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:08,679
(Want to come over to see my cat?)

1416
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:10,178
(The lame flirting changes the number of votes.)

1417
00:55:10,179 --> 00:55:11,309
I hate cats.

1418
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,149
(0 votes)

1419
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:16,126
I shouldn't have asked them to come over to see my cat.

1420
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:19,619
Then maybe I could still have one vote.

1421
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:22,558
I didn't mean for them to come over today.

1422
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:24,189
There was a misunderstanding.

1423
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:27,960
(Female Number 22 leaves with 0 votes.)

1424
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:31,299
Yesterday, you received many votes, didn't you?

1425
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:32,529
Weren't you in the top three?

1426
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:34,669
- Pump It Up. Aren't you a pumper? - Pumper.

1427
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:36,000
- Yes. - Right.

1428
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:38,339
By any chance, are you waiting for someone?

1429
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:40,339
I don't think she has appeared yet.

1430
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:42,279
- He's waiting for her. - How careful.

1431
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:45,050
I'm sure there are men who are saving up their votes.

1432
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:48,650
I didn't think I'd last this long.

1433
00:55:48,849 --> 00:55:50,018
This is bad.

1434
00:55:50,019 --> 00:55:51,519
When will she appear?

1435
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:55,089
One of the keywords that intrigued me was specialist.

1436
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:57,590
The pharmacist was going to be there.

1437
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:01,729
I wanted to get to know more about Number 18.

1438
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:03,428
I'm waiting for that one person.

1439
00:56:03,429 --> 00:56:04,630
(One and only Number 18)

1440
00:56:04,829 --> 00:56:06,868
Here comes the next train.

1441
00:56:06,869 --> 00:56:07,939
(The next train has arrived!)

1442
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:10,209
(Specialists)

1443
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:11,239
She's here.

1444
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:13,170
She's finally here.

1445
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:15,110
I can finally leave this room.

1446
00:56:15,809 --> 00:56:18,179
Meeting her got me excited.

1447
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:21,079
I wanted to know her condition for marriage,

1448
00:56:21,219 --> 00:56:22,650
which wasn't mentioned on our date.

1449
00:56:23,449 --> 00:56:25,150
Here are their conditions for marriage.

1450
00:56:25,489 --> 00:56:26,550
Gosh.

1451
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:28,388
(Chattering)

1452
00:56:28,389 --> 00:56:29,690
All men would vote for her.

1453
00:56:30,829 --> 00:56:33,158
- "A game and animation lover." - Animation lover.

1454
00:56:33,159 --> 00:56:35,098
- That got her two votes. - Right?

1455
00:56:35,099 --> 00:56:37,799
I'm sure many men like that condition.

1456
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,369
She's going to be popular.

1457
00:56:39,469 --> 00:56:42,070
Those who like games are perfect for men.

1458
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:43,670
Do you like them a lot?

1459
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:46,169
My hobbies are playing games,

1460
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:49,280
watching animations, and reading comic books.

1461
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,480
What games do you play?

1462
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:53,518
I play Nintendo and PlayStation games.

1463
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:54,749
(Amazing)

1464
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:56,788
Men are big fans of those.

1465
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:59,749
Isn't PlayStation a dangerous word for a married couple?

1466
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:01,488
- It'll be a wedding gift. - Yes, a wedding gift.

1467
00:57:01,489 --> 00:57:03,260
PlayStation would be the best wedding gift.

1468
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,389
(Games?)

1469
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:08,828
I'm voting every time.

1470
00:57:08,829 --> 00:57:10,130
(Let's give it a shot.)

1471
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:14,039
We'll now reveal her looks and qualifications.

1472
00:57:14,199 --> 00:57:15,638
Here's Female Number 18.

1473
00:57:15,639 --> 00:57:18,170
(Revealing Female Number 18's looks and qualifications)

1474
00:57:19,539 --> 00:57:22,639
("Rewrite The Stars" by Zac Efron and Zendaya)

1475
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:26,349
- She has a nice figure. - Exactly.

1476
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:30,349
- She's pretty. - She looks cute.

1477
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:32,349
He voted.

1478
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:33,888
He was waiting for her.

1479
00:57:33,889 --> 00:57:35,860
- Really. - He must like her a lot.

1480
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:40,760
(His eyes are fixed on her.)

1481
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:43,429
(I hope we get along well.)

1482
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:45,300
She's cute.

1483
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:48,539
Female Number 18...

1484
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:51,269
is a pharmacist wanting to become the husband's queen supporter.

1485
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,880
She majored in medicine at GNU and became a pharmacist.

1486
00:57:55,739 --> 00:57:57,509
- A pharmacist is good. - A pharmacist.

1487
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:58,578
(A pharmacist is nice.)

1488
00:57:58,579 --> 00:57:59,849
Her smile is beautiful.

1489
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:01,879
She's a catch as a wife.

1490
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,150
Please introduce yourself.

1491
00:58:03,519 --> 00:58:05,848
I went to the College of Pharmacy to fulfill my dream...

1492
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:08,960
and came to Couple Palace to find love.

1493
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,159
I'm Female Number 18.

1494
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,799
If you end up marrying me,

1495
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:18,400
I can make you the most loved husband.

1496
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:21,268
I have a question for Number 18.

1497
00:58:21,269 --> 00:58:23,300
Do you not consider men who don't play games?

1498
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:26,468
Other than playing games and watching animations,

1499
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:28,909
are there other hobbies you'd like to pick up?

1500
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:32,309
If you're asked to work out together and not play games...

1501
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:35,679
- Let's change her hobby. - The husband takes away the mouse.

1502
00:58:36,219 --> 00:58:37,848
"Stop playing games now."

1503
00:58:37,849 --> 00:58:39,689
That's getting in her way. Aren't I right?

1504
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:42,888
I don't mind whatever I do...

1505
00:58:42,889 --> 00:58:44,328
if it's with my boyfriend.

1506
00:58:44,329 --> 00:58:47,960
Spending time together is the main focus.

1507
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:51,670
I can play games and such alone.

1508
00:58:53,269 --> 00:58:56,199
(Her perfect answer makes her vote go up.)

1509
00:58:57,340 --> 00:58:58,840
It got me anxious.

1510
00:59:00,039 --> 00:59:01,280
Nice. Yes, Number Seven?

1511
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:03,308
Do you like Pump It Up?

1512
00:59:03,309 --> 00:59:04,380
(Do you like Pump It Up?)

1513
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:07,178
Right, Pump It Up. As for Pump It Up,

1514
00:59:07,179 --> 00:59:09,479
isn't it in a different category?

1515
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,319
- Do you play Pump It Up? - It's slightly different.

1516
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,988
(His mouth is drying up.)

1517
00:59:12,989 --> 00:59:15,089
I love Pump It Up.

1518
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:17,030
- Really? - Do you like it?

1519
00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:18,259
I love Pump It Up.

1520
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:20,229
(Feeling relieved)

1521
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:21,828
- Have you tried it before? - Yes.

1522
00:59:21,829 --> 00:59:23,928
I play it from time to time to relieve my stress.

1523
00:59:23,929 --> 00:59:26,670
Really? She plays it every now and then.

1524
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:29,139
How can this happen?

1525
00:59:32,469 --> 00:59:35,010
- Did you go on a date with her? - Yes.

1526
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:36,879
(Giving up)

1527
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,250
The voting has closed.

1528
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:42,219
- Female Number 18... - She got a total of 3 votes.

1529
00:59:42,619 --> 00:59:45,389
It's time for your first pick. Start.

1530
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:46,820
I'm losing my mind.

1531
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:48,989
I'm dead nervous.

1532
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:53,190
Now then, who will she pick?

1533
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:55,859
Let's see.

1534
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:57,170
- I'm curious. - Let's see.

1535
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,699
- What? - All right.

1536
00:59:59,969 --> 01:00:02,199
- What? - All right.

1537
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:04,769
Oh, no.

1538
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:09,339
I pick Number Seven.

1539
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:10,749
(Female Number 18 and Male Number 7 have another date together.)

1540
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:12,909
- Number Seven. - She picked Number Seven.

1541
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,719
Number Seven.

1542
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:16,719
Number Seven!

1543
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:20,518
- They look good together. - They're a good match.

1544
01:00:20,519 --> 01:00:21,719
- How cute. - They're cute.

1545
01:00:22,389 --> 01:00:24,558
From the experience of hosting Season One,

1546
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:26,788
such a connection is formed...

1547
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:28,058
- eventually. - Yes.

1548
01:00:28,059 --> 01:00:30,400
But later on, it becomes a complete mess.

1549
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:36,039
- What bothered me last was, - Yes?

1550
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:39,940
"What if the last condition was weird?"

1551
01:00:40,110 --> 01:00:41,678
But I absolutely love games and animations.

1552
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:43,679
Really? That's great.

1553
01:00:44,309 --> 01:00:46,280
It made me really happy.

1554
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:49,349
When I asked what games and animations he liked...

1555
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:50,949
Are you a Top Lane? My gosh.

1556
01:00:51,719 --> 01:00:55,119
Time literally flew by.

1557
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:57,788
I'm sure both of us felt it.

1558
01:00:57,789 --> 01:00:59,658
Twenty minutes is too short.

1559
01:00:59,659 --> 01:01:00,799
(20 minutes isn't enough for a date)

1560
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,300
Talking about games alone...

1561
01:01:02,929 --> 01:01:03,969
This is bad.

1562
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:05,729
A 20-minute conversation was too short.

1563
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:07,340
I want to talk to her again.

1564
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:11,439
Even from this point on, I'll only have eyes for Number 18.

1565
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:12,880
(I'll only have eyes for Number 18.)

1566
01:01:13,309 --> 01:01:15,808
The next keyword is former beauty pageant participants.

1567
01:01:15,809 --> 01:01:18,009
(Beauty Pageants)

1568
01:01:18,010 --> 01:01:19,578
(Impressed)

1569
01:01:19,579 --> 01:01:21,848
- Beauty pageants. - Here they come.

1570
01:01:21,849 --> 01:01:23,149
Beauty pageants?

1571
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:25,089
It's a popular preference.

1572
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:26,589
(A highly preferred keyword)

1573
01:01:26,590 --> 01:01:28,919
Beauty pageants prove...

1574
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:31,058
that their looks are guaranteed.

1575
01:01:31,059 --> 01:01:32,129
(Beauty Pageants)

1576
01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:34,098
Who will arrive on the train?

1577
01:01:34,099 --> 01:01:35,779
(Who will be on the Train Beauty Pageant?)

1578
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:37,670
(Excited)

1579
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:39,299
(Number 12)

1580
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:40,868
(Number 2)

1581
01:01:40,869 --> 01:01:43,238
(Number 5)

1582
01:01:43,239 --> 01:01:44,269
Beauty pageants.

1583
01:01:44,539 --> 01:01:46,670
- Gosh. - They're all tall.

1584
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:48,039
(Amazed)

1585
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:52,650
I was interested and curious about her.

1586
01:01:55,349 --> 01:01:57,288
(The fastest speed)

1587
01:01:57,289 --> 01:01:58,819
(Laughing)

1588
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:01,260
We'll now reveal their looks and qualifications.

1589
01:02:01,389 --> 01:02:02,820
No one will get zero votes.

1590
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:04,289
My hopes are high.

1591
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:06,760
Starting with Number 12, please step forward.

1592
01:02:08,699 --> 01:02:10,698
Female Number 12...

1593
01:02:10,699 --> 01:02:12,268
is a former Miss Gyeongbuk...

1594
01:02:12,269 --> 01:02:14,299
and is currently a faculty at Yonsei University.

1595
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:15,300
(Former Miss Gyeongbuk, Yonsei University faculty)

1596
01:02:15,301 --> 01:02:17,369
Number 12 jumped to my eyes.

1597
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:21,980
- Goodness. - She's really tall.

1598
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:24,448
Her salary is around 50,000 dollars,

1599
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:27,449
and she even owns a villa in Seoul.

1600
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:30,380
Next is Female Number Two. Please step forward.

1601
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:33,388
("My Name is Malguem" by QWER)

1602
01:02:33,389 --> 01:02:34,689
Female Number Two...

1603
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:36,218
is a graphic researcher...

1604
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:38,928
creating visual information at the major IT company Naver.

1605
01:02:38,929 --> 01:02:40,359
Having crushed many beauty contests,

1606
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:42,300
she's an intelligent and pretty researcher.

1607
01:02:43,699 --> 01:02:45,199
(Sending cute hearts)

1608
01:02:47,139 --> 01:02:49,969
When Number Two...

1609
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:52,510
was called together with me,

1610
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:55,739
I couldn't grasp the combination.

1611
01:02:56,110 --> 01:02:57,749
(During the train keyword announcement)

1612
01:02:57,750 --> 01:03:02,348
Female Numbers 12, 5, and 2.

1613
01:03:02,349 --> 01:03:03,780
Please take your seat.

1614
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:05,788
I couldn't think of anything.

1615
01:03:05,789 --> 01:03:06,848
(The keyword)

1616
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:08,259
- I have a guess. - What is it?

1617
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:10,659
Maybe from beauty pageants?

1618
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:12,489
Were you in a beauty pageant?

1619
01:03:13,329 --> 01:03:14,960
Everyone is bringing up beauty pageants.

1620
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:18,429
The keyword of the three is beauty pageants.

1621
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:21,839
(Shocking)

1622
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:22,939
Is that how...

1623
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:25,010
Was she in the traditional Korean beauty pageant?

1624
01:03:25,539 --> 01:03:27,510
Which beauty pageant were you in?

1625
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:31,209
From the top four international beauty pageants,

1626
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:33,709
I was in Miss Universe and Miss World.

1627
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:35,126
(In the 2023 Miss Universe and Miss World)

1628
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:37,449
My train was reliable and nice.

1629
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:39,189
(Beauty Pageants)

1630
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:40,919
(So happy)

1631
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:42,788
I had high expectations...

1632
01:03:42,789 --> 01:03:44,928
because our keyword was beauty pageants.

1633
01:03:44,929 --> 01:03:47,030
I thought we'd easily get many votes.

1634
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:51,000
I prepared a performance to fully show off my charms.

1635
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:55,869
Are you ready?

1636
01:03:55,969 --> 01:03:57,710
- I'm ready. - I'm ready.

1637
01:03:58,139 --> 01:04:00,709
(The men are too shy.)

1638
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:01,710
Oh, wow.

1639
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:09,050
(The nervousness made her miss the beat.)

1640
01:04:09,849 --> 01:04:11,448
Is she tone-deaf?

1641
01:04:11,449 --> 01:04:13,936
(The former "I Can See Your Voice" MCs react to the bad singer.)

1642
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:16,690
("Love on Top" by Beyonce)

1643
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:20,860
(Putting aside her singing skills, she's as confident as Beyonce.)

1644
01:04:25,969 --> 01:04:26,969
Her voice is...

1645
01:04:32,039 --> 01:04:33,940
I wasn't really impressed by her.

1646
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:38,250
(Her votes kept decreasing.)

1647
01:04:39,610 --> 01:04:40,619
Thank you.

1648
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:43,449
(But...)

1649
01:04:43,989 --> 01:04:46,718
(one man didn't turn his vote off.)

1650
01:04:46,719 --> 01:04:48,888
I felt her mysterious charm...

1651
01:04:48,889 --> 01:04:50,929
from her dance and singing.

1652
01:04:53,630 --> 01:04:56,698
She's working hard with that small figure, which brought about...

1653
01:04:56,699 --> 01:04:58,130
my protective instincts.

1654
01:04:59,269 --> 01:05:00,638
What am I even saying?

1655
01:05:00,639 --> 01:05:03,739
(Feeling shy)

1656
01:05:04,139 --> 01:05:07,440
Female Number Five will be revealed now.

1657
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,439
Hold on. She's...

1658
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:13,650
She's the one who was in Season One with me.

1659
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:16,019
- I see. - Is it that person?

1660
01:05:16,949 --> 01:05:18,389
Number Five was on last year's show.

1661
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:26,329
It ended on a sad note.

1662
01:05:29,199 --> 01:05:32,170
I want to be happy this time.

1663
01:05:35,869 --> 01:05:36,869
(Who is Female Number 5?)

1664
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:39,969
She's a beauty. I'm serious.

1665
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:42,079
Congratulations!

1666
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:45,078
She's so pretty.

1667
01:05:45,079 --> 01:05:47,039
(She has returned after losing 20kg in 6 months.)

1668
01:05:47,349 --> 01:05:50,349
(Why did she change completely?)

1669
01:05:50,949 --> 01:05:53,050
(During Season 1's Round 1, 1-on-1 date)

1670
01:05:53,489 --> 01:05:57,018
(You're not skinny.)

1671
01:05:57,019 --> 01:05:58,558
(Is it difficult?)

1672
01:05:58,559 --> 01:05:59,760
(Losing weight?)

1673
01:06:00,059 --> 01:06:03,059
That really hurt me.

1674
01:06:04,769 --> 01:06:07,599
I should change. I should change everything.

1675
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,010
I did my best.

1676
01:06:11,809 --> 01:06:12,840
My goal was this day.

1677
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:16,009
(The result of working hard to find her former self)

1678
01:06:16,010 --> 01:06:18,309
If I find someone I truly love,

1679
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:21,119
I want to get married.

1680
01:06:23,079 --> 01:06:24,889
(The woman from Season 1...)

1681
01:06:25,289 --> 01:06:26,948
(has returned with a new look.)

1682
01:06:26,949 --> 01:06:29,760
Female Number Five...

1683
01:06:30,190 --> 01:06:32,690
is the very person who was in Season One.

1684
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:34,928
She's gorgeous.

1685
01:06:34,929 --> 01:06:36,499
She's really slim.

1686
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:37,529
(The moment of truth)

1687
01:06:37,530 --> 01:06:38,969
She was already beautiful,

1688
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:41,170
but she took great care of herself.

1689
01:06:41,369 --> 01:06:43,238
She's a former beauty pageant participant...

1690
01:06:43,239 --> 01:06:45,110
and now a museum curator.

1691
01:06:45,369 --> 01:06:48,110
She's back to her old self when she was one of the finalists...

1692
01:06:48,409 --> 01:06:50,109
of the 2019 Miss Korea.

1693
01:06:50,110 --> 01:06:51,626
(Female Number 5 is back in her beauty era.)

1694
01:06:51,650 --> 01:06:54,249
In the 30 seconds of love at first sight,

1695
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:55,948
- she ranked third. - Really?

1696
01:06:55,949 --> 01:06:58,149
- That's great. - Congratulations.

1697
01:06:58,150 --> 01:06:59,718
(Ranked 3rd among the females)

1698
01:06:59,719 --> 01:07:01,058
You lost a lot of weight.

1699
01:07:01,059 --> 01:07:02,619
- Exactly. - How did you do it?

1700
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:04,859
Before going to work, I worked out every day...

1701
01:07:04,860 --> 01:07:05,860
and watched what I ate.

1702
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:08,058
I even worked out after work.

1703
01:07:08,059 --> 01:07:09,329
- Really? - Yes.

1704
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,698
- Gosh, that was... - Like Kim Jong Kook,

1705
01:07:11,699 --> 01:07:13,929
- Is that so? - just live in the gym.

1706
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,499
- So that's what you did. - Yes.

1707
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:16,799
Are there any questions for her?

1708
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:17,939
Number 16. Go ahead.

1709
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:20,069
- I'd like to ask Number Five. - Okay.

1710
01:07:20,070 --> 01:07:21,980
While watching Season One,

1711
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:24,309
I thought you had a beautiful personality.

1712
01:07:24,510 --> 01:07:27,719
Becoming beautiful on the outside as well really shocked me.

1713
01:07:28,050 --> 01:07:30,948
- Thank you. - Do you have an ideal appearance...

1714
01:07:30,949 --> 01:07:32,849
when it comes to a boyfriend or husband?

1715
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:35,288
Appearance-wise,

1716
01:07:35,289 --> 01:07:38,789
I prefer someone who has similar eyes as me.

1717
01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:40,460
(My eyes are...)

1718
01:07:41,699 --> 01:07:45,369
It'll be great if he has inner double eyelids or monolids.

1719
01:07:46,170 --> 01:07:48,500
He seems to have either monolids or inner double eyelids.

1720
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:50,839
- Right? - Can you check for me?

1721
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:52,960
Let me have a look. Do you have inner double eyelids?

1722
01:07:53,710 --> 01:07:54,780
Let's see.

1723
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,480
(I'm serious.)

1724
01:07:56,579 --> 01:07:57,949
He has inner double eyelids.

1725
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:59,380
Maybe that's just an inner wish.

1726
01:08:01,219 --> 01:08:02,250
That rhymed.

1727
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:05,050
Yes, Number 25?

1728
01:08:05,389 --> 01:08:09,360
Are you fine with your partner being dispatched abroad...

1729
01:08:09,590 --> 01:08:10,689
for a long time?

1730
01:08:10,690 --> 01:08:12,589
He plans to save up a lot of money.

1731
01:08:12,590 --> 01:08:14,299
- That man is an elite. - He's fantastic.

1732
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:16,106
He graduated from one of the top universities...

1733
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:17,729
and works for a public enterprise.

1734
01:08:17,970 --> 01:08:19,930
How long will that be?

1735
01:08:20,670 --> 01:08:22,300
It'll be about two to three years.

1736
01:08:22,939 --> 01:08:23,939
Is that so?

1737
01:08:24,670 --> 01:08:26,140
(What's Female Number 5's answer?)

1738
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:30,140
I'm fine with it.

1739
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:32,879
(Smiling)

1740
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,380
I'll visit often.

1741
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:38,350
He's smiling brightly.

1742
01:08:38,789 --> 01:08:40,488
- His smile... - Your smile looks nice.

1743
01:08:40,489 --> 01:08:42,220
- He's charming when he smiles. - Exactly.

1744
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:43,389
You looked stiff yesterday.

1745
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:44,889
I know, right?

1746
01:08:44,890 --> 01:08:46,090
(He can't hide his happiness.)

1747
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:47,500
What now?

1748
01:08:48,329 --> 01:08:52,299
Now then, Number Five, please make your first pick.

1749
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:54,699
(Female Number 5 sets off to make her 1st pick.)

1750
01:08:55,399 --> 01:08:58,770
- Who will she pick? - Let's see.

1751
01:08:59,369 --> 01:09:02,210
She was interesting and charming.

1752
01:09:02,779 --> 01:09:06,779
Should I say it was her attitude? She gave off a pleasant air.

1753
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:11,050
I want to get married next year...

1754
01:09:11,449 --> 01:09:12,789
or the following year.

1755
01:09:14,590 --> 01:09:15,688
- She's facing... - Yes.

1756
01:09:15,689 --> 01:09:21,659
(Who will go on a 1-on-1 date with Female Number 5?)

1757
01:09:21,930 --> 01:09:23,329
- She's going down. - Yes.

1758
01:09:25,130 --> 01:09:27,069
I'd like to pick Number 25.

1759
01:09:27,739 --> 01:09:29,198
- I see. - He's smiling again.

1760
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:30,799
- That's another big smile. - He knows how to smile.

1761
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,039
Right. Number 25.

1762
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,509
Please head to the couple room together.

1763
01:09:34,510 --> 01:09:35,739
(Such a shame)

1764
01:09:36,079 --> 01:09:38,379
(Female Number 5 and Male Number 25 are matched.)

1765
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:42,318
First off, his smile was very charming.

1766
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:44,590
I could also feel his sincerity.

1767
01:09:45,850 --> 01:09:47,760
- Nice. - That's great.

1768
01:09:47,859 --> 01:09:49,489
I'm choking up.

1769
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:51,789
(I hope they get married.)

1770
01:09:53,159 --> 01:09:57,199
(Female Number 2 and Male Number 5 are matched.)

1771
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:01,239
It seems like...

1772
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:04,710
we need to fill in the hidden conditions.

1773
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:09,108
"I like a blank body..."

1774
01:10:09,109 --> 01:10:11,648
"that looks good in a knitted blank."

1775
01:10:11,649 --> 01:10:13,680
(The male's hidden condition)

1776
01:10:14,579 --> 01:10:16,259
Take a guess. What do you think those are?

1777
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:20,420
It's dress.

1778
01:10:20,421 --> 01:10:21,489
- "Dress?" - Yes.

1779
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:25,228
I like a bottle-shaped body.

1780
01:10:25,229 --> 01:10:28,960
(I like a bottle-shaped body that looks good in a knitted dress.)

1781
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:30,560
I like sexy ladies.

1782
01:10:31,630 --> 01:10:33,699
- Do you care about their education? - No.

1783
01:10:34,170 --> 01:10:36,139
I'm okay as long as they don't do anything illegal.

1784
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:39,470
I prefer someone with a nice body to a pretty face.

1785
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:41,380
If I go further than that,

1786
01:10:42,010 --> 01:10:45,179
I care about the ins and outs of a woman's body.

1787
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:47,409
So I like someone with a nice shape...

1788
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:49,649
like a Coke bottle when wearing a knitted dress.

1789
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:51,850
I like a bottle-shaped body.

1790
01:10:54,819 --> 01:10:56,760
Firstly...

1791
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,060
He really cared about the figure.

1792
01:11:01,529 --> 01:11:02,960
(Her condition for marriage was, )

1793
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:05,469
("Love me even when my looks change.")

1794
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:07,199
"Love me even when my looks change."

1795
01:11:09,939 --> 01:11:11,238
I will have children.

1796
01:11:11,239 --> 01:11:13,869
My looks might change after giving birth.

1797
01:11:15,109 --> 01:11:18,909
It might even change as I get older.

1798
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:24,319
(While he was talking about his hidden condition...)

1799
01:11:25,449 --> 01:11:27,250
My heart started to break all of a sudden.

1800
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:32,890
I wasn't sure if I should get to know him more.

1801
01:11:35,930 --> 01:11:38,630
(Female Number 5 didn't press the heart.)

1802
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:40,500
Family approval...

1803
01:11:41,140 --> 01:11:42,439
- and artists... - Artists.

1804
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:44,770
- I'm dying to meet the artists. - Same here.

1805
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:47,109
The former center of a girl group.

1806
01:11:47,409 --> 01:11:49,978
(The female waiting room before Round 2)

1807
01:11:49,979 --> 01:11:51,648
(Female Number 6, former girl group member, appears.)

1808
01:11:51,649 --> 01:11:53,078
- Goodness. - She's gorgeous.

1809
01:11:53,079 --> 01:11:54,720
- She's so pretty. - She's like an idol.

1810
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:57,419
Celebrities sure are different.

1811
01:11:57,420 --> 01:11:58,420
(Drawing all attention)

1812
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:01,489
(Giving off girl group center vibes)

1813
01:12:01,890 --> 01:12:03,436
What's your biggest reason for wanting to get married?

1814
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:05,729
I want to form my own family.

1815
01:12:05,829 --> 01:12:08,659
I've lived without a family for a long time since I was little.

1816
01:12:10,229 --> 01:12:12,769
My mom passed away when I was in third grade.

1817
01:12:12,770 --> 01:12:16,569
My dad fought against his illness for over ten years.

1818
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:19,309
I lived alone for 25 years...

1819
01:12:19,310 --> 01:12:21,710
without a roommate or a friend.

1820
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,880
More than a boyfriend,

1821
01:12:24,979 --> 01:12:27,579
I want to make a family.

1822
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:31,789
(How far can you go up in terms of age?)

1823
01:12:32,350 --> 01:12:35,188
(Only my age.)

1824
01:12:35,189 --> 01:12:37,159
(I see.)

1825
01:12:37,390 --> 01:12:38,390
(Sensing, she's older, she quickly retrieves her pick.)

1826
01:12:38,391 --> 01:12:39,429
(She continued to give up.)

1827
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:41,029
(Inhaling)

1828
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:42,729
What am I doing here?

1829
01:12:44,229 --> 01:12:45,999
Today, it felt like...

1830
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,469
men weren't interested in me at all.

1831
01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:50,600
All of them.

1832
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:53,739
Am I that unattractive?

1833
01:12:54,010 --> 01:12:55,379
(Her pride is hurt.)

1834
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:57,286
(She moved on to Round 2 without going on a date.)

1835
01:12:57,310 --> 01:12:58,310
I waited for her.

1836
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:02,720
She had a nice smile.

1837
01:13:04,319 --> 01:13:06,989
I knew I could marry her.

1838
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:10,389
I didn't know how enthusiastic he could be.

1839
01:13:10,390 --> 01:13:12,188
If they choose each other, it's a hit.

1840
01:13:12,189 --> 01:13:13,759
If they get married,

1841
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:14,999
I'd go crazy.

1842
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,068
He was the type of person...

1843
01:13:18,069 --> 01:13:20,929
I always thought about...

1844
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:22,869
for my spouse.

1845
01:13:23,739 --> 01:13:24,869
My pick is...

1846
01:13:26,039 --> 01:13:28,879
(That's awesome.)

1847
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,350
I never expected my world to turn pink.

1848
01:13:32,109 --> 01:13:33,408
I like him so much.

1849
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:36,949
(Who's the man she fell in love with?)

1850
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:38,020
(The real game begins now.)

1851
01:13:38,021 --> 01:13:39,618
(Only women who go beyond your expectations remain.)

1852
01:13:39,619 --> 01:13:41,459
(Celebrities sure are different.)

1853
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:42,919
(It's no joke.)

1854
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:44,988
(A series of extreme qualifications)

1855
01:13:44,989 --> 01:13:46,328
(They're all talented.)

1856
01:13:46,329 --> 01:13:48,060
(Am I getting married?)

1857
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:52,229
(But not everyone can join the next round.)

1858
01:13:53,130 --> 01:13:54,568
(Do we get eliminated today?)

1859
01:13:54,569 --> 01:13:56,169
(Who got eliminated...)

1860
01:13:56,170 --> 01:13:58,140
(that shocked everyone?)

1861
01:13:58,470 --> 01:14:02,939
(Finally, Round 3 the massive speed date begins.)

1862
01:14:03,039 --> 01:14:07,049
(It's their last chance to meet someone they want.)

1863
01:14:07,050 --> 01:14:08,050
(It's begun.)

1864
01:14:08,051 --> 01:14:09,249
(I have to pull myself together.)

1865
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:10,250
(If anything, )

1866
01:14:10,251 --> 01:14:11,350
(I might fall behind.)

1867
01:14:11,489 --> 01:14:14,920
(An intense battle for the seat to go on a date)

1868
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:17,959
(You know you're very good-looking?)

1869
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:19,529
(You look very cute.)

1870
01:14:19,859 --> 01:14:21,028
(You're my type.)

1871
01:14:21,029 --> 01:14:23,658
(They flirt even more than before.)

1872
01:14:23,659 --> 01:14:25,969
(I want to go to Japan so badly.)

1873
01:14:25,970 --> 01:14:27,568
(I kind of fell for her.)

1874
01:14:27,569 --> 01:14:29,139
(I liked her even more.)

1875
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:31,840
(You might want to meet someone else.)

1876
01:14:31,970 --> 01:14:33,608
(I only look forward.)

1877
01:14:33,609 --> 01:14:35,309
(You don't have to worry about that.)

1878
01:14:35,310 --> 01:14:36,640
(It was so nice.)

1879
01:14:36,909 --> 01:14:38,148
(How can I describe...)

1880
01:14:38,149 --> 01:14:39,210
(this feeling?)

1881
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:40,709
(Don't let your guard down.)

1882
01:14:40,710 --> 01:14:43,219
(An unexpected rival appears?)

1883
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:44,750
(I like someone funny.)

1884
01:14:45,489 --> 01:14:46,866
(It won't be hard to make you laugh.)

1885
01:14:46,890 --> 01:14:49,020
(Number 24 was hilarious.)

1886
01:14:49,289 --> 01:14:51,229
(I was kind of swayed.)

1887
01:14:51,359 --> 01:14:55,999
(The last stage before the Palace Week)

1888
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,069
(Who will get to enter the Palace Week?)
