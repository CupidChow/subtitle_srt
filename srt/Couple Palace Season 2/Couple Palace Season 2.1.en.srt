5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,360
(I didn't know that one could have good looks and a great job both.)

6
00:00:22,549 --> 00:00:23,549
(Please be my mother's daughter.)

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,949
(Please be my mother's daughter.)

8
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,496
(I want my man to do all the housework and child care.)

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,089
(I want to stay apart from my spouse 8 months a year.)

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:29,988
(If we have a big age gap...)

11
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:31,359
(Is that a question or a proposal?)

12
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,495
(Why do you confess your love?)

13
00:00:32,519 --> 00:00:34,188
(The biggest Speed Dating ever)

14
00:00:34,189 --> 00:00:35,959
(It felt like I was on fire.)

15
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,560
(You don't yield when it comes to love.)

16
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:39,299
(It's a war.)

17
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,799
(Palace Week to bear fruit)

18
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:43,298
(My face became hot.)

19
00:00:43,299 --> 00:00:44,499
(Please hold me tight.)

20
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,616
(You want me to hold you tight?)

21
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,320
(Why do I feel like I'm having an affair?)

22
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:50,640
(It's a matter of timing when it comes to choice and decision.)

23
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,079
(I only need one man for the rest of my life.)

24
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,780
I'm so confused.

25
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,189
If she's the one,

26
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,659
I'll be able to tell as soon as I see her.

27
00:01:04,389 --> 00:01:07,889
I heard you feel that he's the one.

28
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:10,629
I haven't experienced it yet.

29
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:14,600
I hope this is my chance to meet the one.

30

you have to find the one you've been looking for.

35
00:01:48,199 --> 00:01:49,499
- Oh, no. - My goodness.

36
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,600
I didn't see that coming.

37
00:01:52,139 --> 00:01:55,710
Now, the 30 seconds, the time it takes to fall in love,

38
00:01:56,169 --> 00:01:57,209
begins.

39
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,210
Oh, my.

40
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,278
- That's tough. - My hands are getting sweaty.

41
00:02:00,279 --> 00:02:01,749
Oh, no. That's crazy.

42
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,050
- My goodness. - No way.

43
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,948
- This is tense. - Don't you find it tense?

44
00:02:05,949 --> 00:02:07,649
They're all very pretty.

45
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,718
What?

46
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:10,460
Wait. Let me take a look at them.

47
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:12,189
Five.

48
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,959
I had to observe the women.

49
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,300
So I frowned to focus. I didn't smile.

50
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:22,900
Then I noticed she was smiling.

51
00:02:23,529 --> 00:02:24,969
I was most curious about her.

52
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,509
- Four. - I'm number 15.

53
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,539
Please remember me.

54
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,538
Number 15 raised his voice...

55
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:34,308
and tried to break the ice.

56
00:02:34,309 --> 00:02:38,278
Then number 14 next to him caught my attention.

57
00:02:38,279 --> 00:02:41,089
He was closest to my ideal type.

58
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:44,219
- Three. - She was all I could see.

59
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:46,019
- Two. - I spent all 30 seconds...

60
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,329
looking at one person.

61
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,330
- One. - What?

62
00:02:48,331 --> 00:02:49,389
- Already? - My goodness.

63
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,959
- No. - No way.

64
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,029
- But... - Time's up.

You're number two.

73

(Single for 3 years)

74
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:22,089
Number two? I'll look like a loser.

75

Twenty-eight.

79
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:33,499
(The numbers are distributed.)

80
00:03:33,809 --> 00:03:34,809
(People are excited to enter the studio in search of the one.)

81
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,669
- The first impression... - The patent agent and attorney.

82
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,909
I'm here to look for a husband.

83
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,450
I was expecting to find my husband.

84
00:03:41,779 --> 00:03:43,610
I'll marry the one I meet here.

85
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:44,920
Just one.

86
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:46,819
Only one.

88
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,289
Do you know her?

89
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,029
- She's a YouTuber. - What content does she make?

90
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,430
An office worker.

91
00:03:55,629 --> 00:03:57,299
- She's an office worker? - Yes.

92
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,300
(Female Number 8 is a beauty creator.)

93
00:03:58,301 --> 00:04:00,730
- Cool. - I should get her autograph later.

94
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,039
(Another woman adding tension in the studio)

95
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,508
I think I've seen her before.

96
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:09,569
She looks familiar.

97
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:11,538
- She looks like a model. - I know.

98
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:13,139
Maybe a model? An influencer?

99
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,355
(Who is Female Number 6 with extraordinary charisma?)

100
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:17,818
Aren't you a celebrity?

101
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:19,220
- Yes. - Really?

102
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,489
Hello. I'm Chae Eun Jung.

103
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,860
I debuted as a member of CLEO in 1999.

104
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,029
These days, we're called the 1.5 generation idols.

105
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,459
I'm almost the first generation.

106
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:33,969
The biggest obstacle in my love life so far was...

107
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,628
the men had fantasies about me for being a celebrity.

108
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:38,799
Then they were disappointed.

109
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,470
I'm here to find someone who'd accept me for who I am.

110
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:44,078
And?

111
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:46,109
I know a few. A few famous ones.

112
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,779
- Her? - Her?

113
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,780
- Hair? - Really?

114
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,379
I see.

115
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,448
Among the women,

116
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:56,589
some are appearing again.

117
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,688
What? Who?

118
00:04:57,689 --> 00:05:00,119
The Miss Korea from Season One.

119
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,959
The one who went on a date with Guillaume.

120
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,199
(Female Number 20 was all over the Internet.)

121
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,268
(You're not slim.)

122
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:09,399
I know that.

123
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:12,068
(Is it difficult...)

124
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:13,399
(to go on a diet?)

125
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,269
(No, I can do it.)

126
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:17,609
I said I could lose weight.

127
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:21,309
I lost about 20kg in 6 to 7 months.

128
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:26,620
You must find the one who catches your attention the most.

129
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,318
Female Number Five was my type.

130
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:31,489
I thought she was pretty.

131
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,688
I thought she shined.

132
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:35,129
(How does Female Number 5 look now?)

133
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,989
That person isn't here yet.

134
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,998
Why isn't she here?

135
00:05:37,999 --> 00:05:39,805
(Female Number 10 doesn't appear until the end.)

136
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:42,498
During the 30 seconds to fall in love at first sight,

137
00:05:42,499 --> 00:05:46,699
Female Number Ten who received the most votes is entering.

138
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:47,970
Nice.

139
00:05:47,971 --> 00:05:50,780
I thought she was the prettiest too.

140
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,279
(Number 1 in first impression voted by men)

141
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,679
The first place.

142
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,980
(Female Number 10)

143
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,519
- So pretty. - So pretty.

144
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,989
As soon as I saw her, I thought she was pretty.

145
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,019
Thank you.

146
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,790
Everyone thinks the same.

147
00:06:08,059 --> 00:06:10,360
Does the first impression matter?

148
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:11,660
It does.

149
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:16,069
(All the women are here.)

150
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,170
Long time no see.

151
00:06:17,171 --> 00:06:19,438
- It's been so long. - I know.

152
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:22,638
The couple managers who took care of single men's and women's hearts...

153
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,708
are back with an upgrade.

154
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:29,248
In this season, we have a male couple manager.

155
00:06:29,249 --> 00:06:31,919
- To speak up for men's hearts. - Yes.

156
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,748
What do men and women these days...

157
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:36,589
care about the most?

158
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,819
These days, one's economic power is a given.

159
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:41,589
That's a given?

160
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,958
They care about economic power, height, and physique.

161
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:47,128
- It means one has to be perfect. - Yes.

162
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:48,199
Yes.

163
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:51,600
- What? - What is it?

164
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,308
The ten keywords will now be revealed.

165
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:55,708
(S Company, boyish charms, 188cm-tall guy...)

166
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:58,208
These keywords are something the three men on the train...

167
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:01,110
have in common.

168
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:05,550
Vote for the keyword you look forward to the most.

169
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:07,420
What should I choose?

170
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:08,949
What did you choose?

171
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,289
I chose the elite who studied abroad.

172
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,318
What did you choose?

173
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,459
- The doctor. - The doctor?

174
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:15,458
You both know what you want.

175
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:18,159
- Maybe I wasn't honest enough. - Did you choose manly men?

176
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,259
Diligence.

177
00:07:20,829 --> 00:07:22,998
Wait. These keywords are great.

178
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:24,299
Because they have the same condition,

179
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,339
it's easier to compare them.

180
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,970
I look forward to seeing them all.

181
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,909

00:07:33,309 --> 00:07:34,980
Round One. Men's speed train.

184
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:38,420
Thirty men will appear on a special train.

185
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,989
The marriage conditions, qualifications,

186
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:43,550
and their appearances will be revealed.

187
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,859
The women can choose the men they like...

188
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,590
and ask them out on a date.

189
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,758
They can only go on a date with one person.

190
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,100
The decision is up to the men.

191
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,898
When the date is set, they immediately go on a one-on-one date.

192
00:07:55,899 --> 00:07:58,019
(When the date is set, they'll move to the location.)

193
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,008
- We're back after a year. - Yes.

194
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:03,339
I feel some changes.

195
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,638
First of all, the studio has been upgraded.

196
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,979
Even the participants.

197
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,008
- Right. - They look more hopeful...

198
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:12,049
- compared to Season One. - Yes.

199
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,878
- They look excited. - Yes.

200
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:16,850
Don't hesitate to ask them out and express your feelings.

201
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,289
Let's get married!

202
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,790
- Let's go! - Let's go!

203
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,160
The first train is arriving.

204
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,530
(Sweet large dog-like)

205
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:32,370
- Sweet large dog-like. - Oh, my gosh.

206
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:34,210
Sweet large dog-like?

207
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,239
- A large dog. - Oh, my.

208
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,639
All women like large dogs.

209
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,449
A man who has the qualities of a dog is my type.

210
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,079
Everyone will vote for them.

211
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,719
- You're right. - First, second, third places...

212
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,000
- in first impression. - Oh, no.

213
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,489
What does it mean by sweet large dog-like?

214
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,119
They can't just be big like me.

215
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,519
No. You're more like a hunting dog.

216
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,829
Since this train is about their appearance,

217
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,430
their appearance will be revealed first.

218
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,929
(Train 1 enters.)

219
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,799
My gosh. I'm so nervous.

220
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:07,038
- Oh, my gosh. - Oh, my gosh.

221
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,440
Oh, my.

222
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:09,539
What?

223
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:16,749
- My goodness. - Can I vote for him?

224
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:18,749
Yes, vote first.

225
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:21,589
The number of votes is increasing very quickly.

226
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,990
He has handsome ears.

227
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,419
Seven votes already?

228
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,359
He has a cute smile.

229
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,389
I like someone with pretty lips.

230
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,200
His lips looked nice when he smiled.

231
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,099
The next sweet large dog-like man.

232
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,138
He placed first in the first 30 seconds with 7 votes.

233
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:39,669
And he placed third.

234
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,310
- Impressive. - Awesome.

235
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:47,099
It felt like my eyesight was improving.

236
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:49,610
He looked pretty decent.

237
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,549
I want to switch to yellow.

238
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:53,850
Switch.

239
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,418
He's getting votes.

240
00:09:56,419 --> 00:09:59,119
- He's so good-looking. - He has a neat sense of style.

241
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,830
He has a nice set of teeth. He has a nice smile.

242
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:03,889
He seems to be shy.

243
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:08,029
He's getting more votes.

244
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,669
All three of them have different vibes.

245
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:12,739
It'll change once their occupations are revealed.

246
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,840
Only their appearances have been revealed so far.

247
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,839
Once their qualifications are revealed,

248
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,309
how will the results change?

249
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,110
Please reveal their qualifications.

250
00:10:22,049 --> 00:10:24,579
(Number 3's walk-out song, "Odoriko" by Vaundy)

251
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,219
Male Number Three.

252
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,990
He's an employee at a conglomerate in Tokyo.

253
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,120
(He's cute.)

254
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:34,528
(He has the antiques to melt women's hearts.)

255
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:35,928
(Disarming immediately)

256
00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:38,128
He's been living in Japan for 12 years.

257
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:39,960
He has permanent residency in Japan.

258
00:10:40,429 --> 00:10:43,668
He works at the biggest IT conglomerate in Japan.

259
00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:45,799
He makes about 80,000 dollars annually.

260
00:10:46,499 --> 00:10:47,509
Nice to meet you.

261
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:49,440
I'm very happy to meet all of you.

262
00:10:50,539 --> 00:10:51,709
(Changing her pick after hearing his greeting in Japanese)

263
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:54,879
Hello, I crossed the sea to find my partner.

264
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,909
I'm Male Number Three.

265
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:01,089
I've lived in Japan since college...

266
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,950
and I've lived there for 12 years now.

267
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,789
The thought of starting a family...

268
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:08,129
and settling down came to me...

269
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,090
recently.

270
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,298
I feel very nervous,

271
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:16,669
but I can no longer live abroad in solitude.

272
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:18,189
I must do something about it.

273
00:11:18,499 --> 00:11:21,940
Would anyone like to live with me in Japan?

274
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,179
She would have to go to Japan.

275
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:25,279
She has to leave?

276
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,439
(Thinking)

277
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,610
It's okay even if you don't speak Japanese at all.

278
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,179
I can be responsible and take care of you.

279
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:32,480
It's too far.

280
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,548
Moving to another region...

281
00:11:34,549 --> 00:11:36,590
- is a huge deal. - Yes, it's a huge deal.

282
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,290
You have to give up everything to leave.

283
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,690
- Can you move to Japan? - Of course.

284
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:45,099
He places last when it comes to the number of votes.

285
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,300
The number of votes plummeted.

286
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,869
This isn't simply about dating.

287
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,340
- Marriage is the premise. - Right.

288
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,840
I'd like to do one last thing...

289
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,269
Are you not satisfied?

290
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,309
May I show something that could convince them?

291
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,310
- Yes. - Oh, my.

00:11:59,909 --> 00:12:01,549
(What is Male Number 3's secret weapon?)

293
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:06,179

(Shrieking with joy)

295
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:10,960
Stop it.

296
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,619
This is terrible.

297
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,620
(Feeling dizzy)

298
00:12:13,621 --> 00:12:15,330
(They're dumbfounded.)

299
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,460
So this is how he is.

300
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,560
That's cute.

301
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,560
That's amazing.

302
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,629
I feel bewildered.

303
00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:24,870
Goodbye. I'm going to Japan.

304
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,070
Have a good trip.

Number 13, please come out.

308
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,120
I can't wait to get to know him.

309
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,679
He looks cute.

310
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,326
("10,000 Hours" by Dan and Shay, Justin Bieber.)

311
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,779
His face looks as small as mine.

312
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,450
He looks paler than me.

313
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,620
(Being adorable with his hands)

314
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,959
(He's so cute.)

315
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,990
Male Number 13 is...

the CEO of an indie artist agency.

317
00:12:49,789 --> 00:12:51,706
He graduated from Chung-Ang University with a business degree.

318
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,929
His annual salary is about 80,000 dollars.

319
00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:58,740
I run an indie music record label.

320

I'm Male Number 13.

321
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,210
I majored in business administration.

322
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,580
But I love music very much,

323
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,100
so I started management in the entertainment industry.

324
00:13:07,749 --> 00:13:10,649
If I meet someone on the show whom I want to marry,

325
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,579
I won't look back and put my everything...

326
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,590
into it.

He can play the piano.

He nailed it.

345
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,919
Men who can play musical instruments are attractive.

346
00:14:25,889 --> 00:14:27,788
I thought that he was very charming.

347
00:14:27,789 --> 00:14:29,830

He reminds me of an Alaskan Malamute.

356
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,279
- He has an adorable smile. - He's very cute.

357

how will the ranking change?

361

I can't wait to find out.

362
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,990

363
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,090
Here they are.

364
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,429
This is about marriage, and it's reality.

365
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,898
Looks are important...

366
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:12,169
This is about marriage, so I do have conditions.

367
00:15:12,539 --> 00:15:15,340
I don't think love is everything.

368
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,810
Will the number of votes be maintained?

369
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,148
My goodness.

370
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:22,149
They're a little...

371
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:25,249
"A mom-like woman willing to start her newlywed life in Tokyo."

372
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,519
"A mom-like woman?"

373
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:30,120
There are three obstacles in that one sentence.

374
00:15:30,549 --> 00:15:32,220
- I turned mine off. - You did?

375
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,359
"I'd like someone who has wealth to inherit."

376
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,559
(One less pick)

377
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,560
I don't have any.

378
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:39,359
(Many give up after the conditions are revealed.)

379
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,899
They're going down.

380
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,668
After the conditions were revealed, there was an overall decrease.

381
00:15:43,669 --> 00:15:44,669
It completely changed.

382
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:46,600
Number 13 is in first place.

383
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,039
Number Three is in second place.

384
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,269
Number 14 is in third place.

385
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,939
Now, it's time for the first pick.

386
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,610
Among the women who picked them,

387
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:56,610
the men will either pick one...

388
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:59,080
or give up on picking altogether.

389
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:01,649
Male Number Three, please choose your first pick.

390
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:02,919
(The first pick time starts for Male Number 3.)

391
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,919
Their hearts must be fluttering.

392
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,158
(Please pick me.)

393
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:09,128
Whom will he take to Tokyo with him?

394
00:16:09,129 --> 00:16:10,129
Right.

395
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,600
All of them are so beautiful.

396
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,700
Their hearts must be fluttering.

397
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:17,129
I pick Number Eight.

398
00:16:18,669 --> 00:16:21,710
(Male Number 3 picks Female Number 8.)

399
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,809
Number Eight sent him a heart at the last moment.

400
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:26,340
- She appealed to him. - Yes, she was successful.

401
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:30,908
When his looks were revealed, his hand was shaking.

402
00:16:30,909 --> 00:16:33,048
He looked very nervous,

403
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:35,349
so I waved my hands...

404
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:37,349
and welcomed him.

405
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,090
Then he started smiling...

406
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,159
and seemed more relaxed.

407
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,499
Just as I planned.

408
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:50,428
(Female Number 8 and Male Number 3 are matched.)

409
00:16:50,429 --> 00:16:52,668
- Thank you for picking me. - You're welcome.

410
00:16:52,669 --> 00:16:55,340
(Male Number 14 and Female Number 30 are matched.)

411
00:16:55,539 --> 00:16:58,179
(Can you fall in love at first sight?)

412
00:16:58,509 --> 00:17:01,109
I haven't fallen in love at first sight.

413
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,908
I believe that it's possible,

414
00:17:02,909 --> 00:17:04,350
but I never saw it happen.

415
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,949
I don't think so except when I was a teenager.

416
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:11,149
I've fallen in love at first sight.

417
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:15,459
Someone I'm meant to be with...

418
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:16,860
and love.

419
00:17:17,389 --> 00:17:21,529
I'd like to meet someone who thinks...

420
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:22,699
the same way I do.

421
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,139
You're number four.

422
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:28,269
(Someone who will recognize one another at first sight)

423
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,840
- Let's go. - You can do it.

424
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,079
(Will he meet someone whom he's meant to be with?)

425
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,810
Here comes the next train.

426
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,120
The elites who studied abroad are...

427
00:17:40,449 --> 00:17:42,250
Male Numbers Four and Nine.

428
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,320
We can't see their faces anymore.

429
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,688
- We expect them to get many votes. - Yes.

430
00:17:46,689 --> 00:17:49,228
This time, the keyword is "elites who studied abroad."

431
00:17:49,229 --> 00:17:51,349
- "Elites who studied abroad." - You waited for them.

432
00:17:51,629 --> 00:17:53,659
- They're finally here. - Finally.

433
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,428
It's impossible for women not to prefer elite men...

434
00:17:57,429 --> 00:17:58,569
- who studied abroad. - I agree.

435
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,269
They're usually well-off,

436
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,709
and women think that they're less conservative.

437
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,539
If you like him, please press the pick button.

438
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,080
They're picking already.

439
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,750
He has the typical outfit of a Korean American.

440
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:14,119
Number Nine's silhouette reminds me...

441
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,820
- of Ma Dong Seok. - You're right.

442
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:17,649
- They look similar. - Gosh.

443
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,220
(Physicality score 100 points)

444
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,688
Many of them are picking him.

445
00:18:21,689 --> 00:18:22,859
(The number of votes is increasing quickly.)

446
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,090
He's so popular.

447
00:18:25,129 --> 00:18:26,729
What's going on with Number Four?

448
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,570
For Number Four...

449
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,639
Is his toothpick the problem?

450
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,100
- Number Four. - His toothpick is annoying.

451
00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:35,749
Is he in a Hong Kong movie?

452
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,110
What could it mean?

453
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,016
The train of elites who studied abroad.

454
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,179
Here are their conditions for marriage.

455
00:18:42,979 --> 00:18:43,979
All right.

456
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,125
(Be my mother's daughter. I don't want to buy an apartment.)

457
00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:46,949
(Everyone sighs.)

458
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,820
"Be my mother's daughter?"

459
00:18:49,219 --> 00:18:51,719
Unbelievable. How do we pick between the two?

460
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,488
Women always say,

461
00:18:53,489 --> 00:18:55,569
"A woman can never be her mother-in-law's daughter."

462
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,899
Many people say that, don't they?

463
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,099
"Be my mother's daughter."

464
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,699
Number Four, what do you mean by this?

465
00:19:03,229 --> 00:19:05,899
I'm an only child.

466
00:19:06,239 --> 00:19:07,239
You're an only child.

467
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:10,870
I'd like her to fulfill the needs...

468
00:19:11,239 --> 00:19:12,580
that I can't as a son.

469
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:17,310
I'm also ready to be a son-in-law who's like a son.

470
00:19:17,979 --> 00:19:21,120
In return, he's willing to be her mother's son.

471
00:19:21,689 --> 00:19:22,719
I'll be her daughter.

472
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,719
- Can you be his family? - I'm okay with that.

473
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,060
I can be her daughter.

474
00:19:29,129 --> 00:19:31,729
All right. Male Number Nine.

475
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,729
- Wait. - To us...

476
00:19:35,229 --> 00:19:36,668
- His silhouette looks... - Wait a minute.

477
00:19:36,669 --> 00:19:38,799
Familiar to us.

478
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,139
Male Number Nine, please come out.

479
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,678
("Thank U, Next" by Ariana Grande)

480
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:51,050
He was on Season One.

481
00:19:52,449 --> 00:19:54,580
I prefer Number Nine's looks.

482
00:19:54,689 --> 00:19:55,719
- Really? - Yeah.

483
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,060
He looks very relaxed.

484
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,560
He looks like a celebrity.

485
00:20:00,719 --> 00:20:02,659
Mi Joo would be very happy.

486
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,159
He's back?

487
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,959
He came to see me.

488
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
(Kiss)

489
00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:11,899
(Shooting a heart with lots of spunk)

490
00:20:12,699 --> 00:20:14,570
Male Number Nine is...

491
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:17,369
an American lawyer from Season One.

492
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:18,530
We're happy to see him again.

493
00:20:18,709 --> 00:20:21,510
He came back better after a year.

494
00:20:22,909 --> 00:20:24,478
(He was on COUPLE PALACE with a shy smile.)

495
00:20:24,479 --> 00:20:25,918
(An American lawyer...)

496
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,419
(who used to be an athlete)

497
00:20:29,719 --> 00:20:33,489
(His first meeting with her in January 2024)

498
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,360
(He was more honest than anyone in front of love.)

499
00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:43,628
(However, there was no miracle...)

500
00:20:43,629 --> 00:20:48,340
(of being loved by the one I love.)

501
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:51,580
In Season 1, my number was 35.

502
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,040
But my number in Season 2 is 9.

503
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:57,149
- number nine. - My gosh, I'm in trouble.

504
00:20:58,649 --> 00:21:01,919
It sort of feels as if I've regressed.

505
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,020
Did you miss me?

506
00:21:05,659 --> 00:21:07,620
What was that? That was random.

507
00:21:08,389 --> 00:21:09,389
Hello.

508
00:21:09,389 --> 00:21:10,389
(9: American lawyer from Season 1)

509
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,128
I'm Number Nine,

510
00:21:12,129 --> 00:21:15,500
the most consistent guy from Seasons One and Two.

511
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,929
- What? There... - What's going on?

512
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,739
What's going on? He got nine votes.

513
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,169
- Why... - What is this?

514
00:21:22,469 --> 00:21:24,349
- Right now... - He wasn't that popular before.

515
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:27,080
He got a lot of votes. He now has 12 votes.

516
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,149
Personally,

517
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:32,020
there's still so much I want from this show.

518
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:35,350
In the first season, I met a lady with a bob haircut.

519
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,590
And she was my type.

520
00:21:37,949 --> 00:21:39,189
I liked her from the get-go.

521
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,559
- Shouldn't you turn it off? - Right?

522
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,590
Is he telling us to withdraw our votes?

523
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,060
Stop it.

524
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,829
(Stop talking.)

525
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,369
When you're on blind dates with women,

526
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,869
even if they ask you leading questions,

527
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,870
- you can't talk about your past. - Don't do that.

528
00:21:51,939 --> 00:21:52,969
Stop!

529
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:56,310
I saw a lot of ladies here with a bob haircut this season.

530
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,879
(A bob haircut?)

531
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:03,009
I made it to the wedding hall with her.

532
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,450
- Stop it. - Stop talking about her!

533
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:06,948
Can you give him the earbuds? Let me tell him to stop talking.

534
00:22:06,949 --> 00:22:07,949
Here's what we should do.

535
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,350
(Everyone fires their dart gun.)

536
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,989
Happy wife, happy life.

537
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,290
Thank you very much.

538
00:22:14,659 --> 00:22:16,259
(He wraps up his introduction with a sweet line.)

539
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,940
It sounded like a campaign speech for the US presidential election.

540
00:22:19,229 --> 00:22:21,299
- When he mentioned Season One, - Yes.

541
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,600
He did lose a few votes.

542
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,898
Well, he can't hide it anyway. It's been aired already.

543
00:22:24,899 --> 00:22:27,198
- But in the first season, - Yes.

544
00:22:27,199 --> 00:22:29,040
He was quite authentic.

545
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:33,039
It was a tough call. There was a lady I was curious about.

546
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,409
Number 12? She caught my eyes right away.

547
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,379
Then there was Number 25.

548
00:22:37,949 --> 00:22:39,378
When I saw her,

549
00:22:39,379 --> 00:22:41,850
I just thought that I was seeing Eun Ye Sol's lookalike.

550
00:22:44,219 --> 00:22:46,718
I was in a dilemma about which one to choose.

551
00:22:46,719 --> 00:22:47,719
- I see. - Yes.

552
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,159
(Whom will he choose?)

553
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:52,159
Next. Number Four, please come on out.

554
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,199
(Number 4's face is revealed.)

555
00:23:02,969 --> 00:23:04,039
(Catching attention with his handsome face)

556
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,639
- Why... - Hold on.

557
00:23:07,709 --> 00:23:08,850
He's handsome.

558
00:23:10,649 --> 00:23:13,020
I was like, "What? He's so handsome."

559
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,148
("Love of the Past" by Leslie Cheung)

560
00:23:16,149 --> 00:23:17,189
- My gosh. - Hey.

561
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:21,728
(Your lighthearted laughter brings me warmth)

562
00:23:21,729 --> 00:23:25,659
(You give me exciting thrills)

563
00:23:30,169 --> 00:23:32,570
(Singing passionately)

564
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,010
He's so handsome. And he's tall too.

565
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,208
(His looks stood out more than his singing.)

566
00:23:41,209 --> 00:23:42,689
(He finishes showing off his talent.)

567
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,819
All right. Number Four graduated...

568
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,878
from the most prestigious university in China.

569
00:23:47,879 --> 00:23:49,489
And he works at a conglomerate.

570
00:23:49,949 --> 00:23:51,659
My mother will love him.

571
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,360
He graduated from Tsinghua University,

572
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,459
the most prestigious school in China.

573
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,629
His annual salary is approximately 60,000 dollars.

574
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,158
(He indeed went to a prestigious school abroad.)

575
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,228
- He got a lot of votes. - He's getting a lot of votes.

576
00:24:02,229 --> 00:24:04,769
We gave them 30 seconds to fall in love in the beginning.

577
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:06,299
He was ranked third after the first impression vote.

578
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,398
He's perfect in every category.

579
00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:08,840
He's the complete package.

580
00:24:08,969 --> 00:24:10,009
Number Four.

581
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:11,530
- Could you introduce yourself? - Yes.

582
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,540
(Slightly nervous)

583
00:24:13,979 --> 00:24:15,010
Hello.

584
00:24:15,209 --> 00:24:18,918
I'm Number Four, a well-balanced man.

585
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:20,378
(4: Prestigious university graduate, employee at a conglomerate)

586
00:24:20,379 --> 00:24:21,478
Are you all right?

587
00:24:21,479 --> 00:24:22,850
I bet you were startled earlier.

588
00:24:24,989 --> 00:24:26,389
I'm not a weirdo or anything.

589
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,129
I'm a bit nervous to be here.

590
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:31,105
But I mustered up the courage and joined the show.

591
00:24:31,129 --> 00:24:34,830
I'd like to express my excitement to be here.

592
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,129
Nice to meet you.

593
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:40,540
He started with zero votes but ended with seven votes.

594
00:24:40,739 --> 00:24:41,739
That's impressive.

595
00:24:42,139 --> 00:24:44,610
What's the maximum age you'd consider dating?

596
00:24:45,939 --> 00:24:47,010
The maximum age?

597
00:24:47,879 --> 00:24:50,079
(Thinking about it seriously)

598
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,079
If it's too hard, you can answer in Chinese.

599
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,379
(He's done thinking about it.)

600
00:24:54,989 --> 00:24:57,849
The maximum age I'd consider dating would be my age.

601
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:59,796
- So that's a no to older women. - No to older women?

602
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,060
That's right.

603
00:25:01,489 --> 00:25:04,159
I understand. Thank you for your answer.

604
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,260
Thank you for your answer.

605
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,306
- Gosh. - She just withdrew her vote.

606
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:10,429
(Feeling bad)

607
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:13,039
Should I turn mine off? Will it work?

608
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,246
- Don't turn it off. - It was...

609
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:17,370
I'm going to turn it off when no one is paying attention.

610
00:25:18,239 --> 00:25:20,540
I thought that I had made a huge mistake.

611
00:25:20,709 --> 00:25:22,586
He said he wanted his wife to be a daughter to his mother.

612
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:24,779
And he said he was ready to be a son...

613
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,520
to his wife's parents.

614
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,889
I liked that about him.

615
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:31,050
Then this guy was singing...

616
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,820
one of my mom's favorite songs, a song by a Hong Kong star.

617
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:39,030
So I kept my light on the whole time.

618
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,570
But I didn't know he'd be that handsome.

619
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:46,370
It's difficult for me to be with handsome guys.

620
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,540
Number Four, it's time to make your first pick. Start.

621
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:58,010
He's coming.

622
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,178
Hello.

623
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:01,449
(Meeting her eyes)

624
00:26:01,649 --> 00:26:02,750
Hello.

625
00:26:06,989 --> 00:26:09,330
During the first impression vote...

626
00:26:10,389 --> 00:26:13,129
Thirty seconds, the time it takes to fall in love.

627
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:15,529
I saw her smile.

628
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,000
That made her look more attractive.

629
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,139
My first pick is...

630
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,540
(Who is the lady that caught his eye at first sight?)

631
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:28,679
Thank you.

632
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,979
(Male Number 4 and Female Number 10 are matched.)

633
00:26:31,479 --> 00:26:34,679
(The two of them are shy to meet each other's gaze.)

634
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,988
(Did you fall in love at first sight?)

635
00:26:37,989 --> 00:26:39,388
During the 30 seconds,

636
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,830
she looked beautiful when she was smiling.

637
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,360
(Smiling)

638
00:26:43,361 --> 00:26:47,300
I wondered if someone else would pick her.

639
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,800
I was quite nervous too.

640
00:26:50,729 --> 00:26:54,399
She voted for me which was perfect timing.

641
00:26:54,639 --> 00:26:56,270
My first pick is Number Ten.

642
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,739
His first pick is Number Ten.

643
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:02,979
I thought that it was the best thing I did all day.

644
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:08,820
(When it's a match, the two of them will have a date here.)

645
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,620
Your one-on-one date will begin now.

646
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:15,729
Please fill out each other's profile card.

647
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:19,760
I'm so curious about the hidden condition.

648
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,228
Let's fill it out.

649
00:27:22,229 --> 00:27:23,229
(Will they still be interested...)

650
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,576
(after the hidden condition is revealed?)

651
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,500
This is a great photo, by the way.

652
00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:28,869
- Do I look that bad in person? - My gosh, no.

653
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:30,339
It looks just like you in person.

654
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,580
No. I can't seem to look at you.

655
00:27:36,149 --> 00:27:37,209
I'm too shy.

656
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:40,148
Seriously. He's way too handsome.

657
00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:43,350
When we were talking in private,

658
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,988
I kept talking while looking at the card...

659
00:27:44,989 --> 00:27:47,290
because he looked much better in person.

660
00:27:47,489 --> 00:27:50,229
I couldn't speak when I looked at him.

661
00:27:50,729 --> 00:27:52,030
So I talked while looking down.

662
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,259
(Gosh, he's handsome.)

663
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,399
"The photo..." I don't even know what I said.

664
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:59,030
- The hidden condition. - So I have to guess it, right?

665
00:27:59,239 --> 00:28:01,238
- Try guessing. - "My mother's..."

666
00:28:01,239 --> 00:28:02,738
(I want her to learn my mother's...)

667
00:28:02,739 --> 00:28:03,770
What could it be?

668
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,540
What is it?

669
00:28:05,879 --> 00:28:07,209
It ends with "recipes."

670
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:09,709
- Your mother must be a chef. - Yes?

671
00:28:09,949 --> 00:28:11,549
- Seasoning. - Seasoning?

672
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,580
The flavor profile?

673
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,780
Side dish? Broth?

674
00:28:15,149 --> 00:28:16,389
Sauce?

675
00:28:16,889 --> 00:28:18,019
It's just food.

676
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,059
- Food recipes? - Yes.

677
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,320
- Just food recipes? - Yes.

678
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,929
Do you like cooking?

679
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,360
Yes, I do.

680
00:28:24,929 --> 00:28:26,599
I bet you're busy in the kitchen.

681
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,699
No, I don't cook.

682
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:30,529
- You like eating them? - I...

683
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:32,930
- You like eating them? - I like eating my family's cooking.

684
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,570
So you just eat the food your family cooks.

685
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:37,468
(The two of them are getting along well even now.)

686
00:28:37,469 --> 00:28:38,510
That's great.

687
00:28:40,639 --> 00:28:42,179
For the first impression vote,

688
00:28:42,979 --> 00:28:44,750
whom did you pick?

689
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,320
Actually,

690
00:28:46,649 --> 00:28:48,590
- I didn't get a good look at all. - Right.

691
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:52,590
To be honest, I don't like tall guys.

692
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,859
- Is that so? - Yes.

693
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,889
I don't find tall guys attractive.

694
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,158
Then what's the range for the desired height?

695
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:02,999
Well, if he's taller than 180cm,

696
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,569
I don't find him attractive.

697
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:05,669
- Is that so? - Yes.

698
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:08,198
Is there a reason for that? You're tall too. Usually...

699
00:29:08,199 --> 00:29:09,639
I like guys who are shorter than me.

700
00:29:10,169 --> 00:29:11,810
So you like short guys, right?

701
00:29:12,639 --> 00:29:14,556
I'd still like him even if he's shorter than me.

702
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,940
Why don't you like tall guys then?

703
00:29:16,149 --> 00:29:18,510
I don't like it when guys brag about their height.

704
00:29:19,649 --> 00:29:22,149
And all of my male friends...

705
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:24,020
- They're all tall? - are all tall.

706
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:27,719
When they're tall, I just think of them as my friends.

707
00:29:28,219 --> 00:29:29,260
Yes.

708
00:29:29,629 --> 00:29:32,100
- I won't wear dress shoes tomorrow. - Okay.

709
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:35,229
I'll wear flip-flops.

710
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,910
I'll try to reduce my height, even if just a little.

711
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,169
Thank you.

712
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:43,438
I was a bit flustered.

713
00:29:43,439 --> 00:29:45,810
But I'm 179cm tall.

714
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:50,810
In that short period, I was quite attracted to her.

715
00:29:51,149 --> 00:29:53,149
It was quite fascinating.

716
00:29:55,219 --> 00:29:57,050
Let's meet the next train.

717
00:29:57,649 --> 00:29:59,958
(Gentle and Rich)

718
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:00,959
That's a big one.

719
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,229
"Rich." That one word is powerful.

720
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,188
It's Gentle and Rich. They're up.

721
00:30:05,189 --> 00:30:06,229
I can't wait.

722
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,059
When ladies meet them face to face,

723
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,999
- ladies will find them attractive. - I see.

724
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,040
The average age is slightly high.

725
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,238
(Grouping in the men's waiting room)

726
00:30:14,239 --> 00:30:15,409
Male Number Two.

727
00:30:15,669 --> 00:30:16,909
Wait, that's me.

728
00:30:17,709 --> 00:30:20,139
Male Number 27. Male Number 28.

729
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:24,579
Gentle and Rich!

730
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,520
(Everyone's eyes are on them.)

731
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,019
(Elegant and relaxed poses)

732
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,219
They even sit differently.

733
00:30:31,649 --> 00:30:34,120
They represented the keyword. They seemed so relaxed.

734
00:30:34,489 --> 00:30:36,590
The keyword stood out a lot.

735
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:39,030
Gentle and Rich? They're flat-out rich?

736
00:30:39,459 --> 00:30:43,030
I was worried about the keyword.

737
00:30:43,229 --> 00:30:46,040
But after seeing them in person, I wasn't worried at all...

738
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:48,770
about the keyword, Gentle and Rich.

739
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,370
I'm sorry to say that.

740
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:53,510
(How will the ladies react?)

741
00:30:53,511 --> 00:30:55,749
All right. Here's Train Gentle and Rich.

742
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:59,449
We have Male Numbers 2, 27, and 28.

743
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:00,949
Here I go.

744
00:31:01,719 --> 00:31:03,750
- I'm serious. - Bye.

745
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:06,360
This is about marriage, and it's reality.

746
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,760
I liked the keyword, Gentle and Rich.

747
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,128
- My gosh. - What's going on?

748
00:31:14,129 --> 00:31:15,869
They're garnering a lot of votes.

749
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:18,370
- Do you like them? - I must see their faces first.

750
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,669
Here are their conditions for marriage.

751
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,468
(I don't want women who have had many plastic surgeries.)

752
00:31:23,469 --> 00:31:26,209
My gosh. Hold on.

753
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,379
- My gosh. - What do they plan to do?

754
00:31:29,949 --> 00:31:32,009
Here's what Number Two wants.

755
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:34,490
"I want a woman who is as naturally beautiful as Kim Tae Hee."

756
00:31:34,649 --> 00:31:35,918
- Gosh. - As beautiful as Kim Tae Hee?

757
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,119
(As beautiful as Kim Tae Hee?)

758
00:31:37,989 --> 00:31:40,158
- My gosh. - Number Two.

759
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,359
Because of your condition,

760
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,629
everyone withdrew their votes.

761
00:31:45,129 --> 00:31:46,129
I'm sorry.

762
00:31:46,229 --> 00:31:47,759
(Laughing)

763
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,398
- He apologized quickly. - He must regret it a lot.

764
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,438
Wait. Check out Number 27's condition.

765
00:31:52,439 --> 00:31:54,698
- Yes. - It's an aggressive condition.

766
00:31:54,699 --> 00:31:56,769
- But he still has the votes. - They didn't withdraw the votes.

767
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,309
So in their minds, they're thinking,

768
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,979
"I didn't get that many."

769
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,310
"I only got injections."

770
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:05,109
- "I..." - Injections?

771
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:07,149
- "I only got treatments." - Treatments.

772
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:11,188
I wonder what kind of change there will be

773
00:32:11,189 --> 00:32:12,949
after revealing their faces and backgrounds.

774
00:32:12,989 --> 00:32:14,590
Gentle and Rich.

775
00:32:14,719 --> 00:32:16,958
They are quite an intriguing keyword.

776
00:32:16,959 --> 00:32:18,330
I was excited.

777
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:21,860
Male Number Two. Please step forward.

778
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:24,300
(Number 2's walk-out song)

779
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,610
Gosh, what?

780
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:31,409
What is this?

781
00:32:31,669 --> 00:32:34,709
He wants a woman who is as naturally beautiful as Kim Tae He.

782
00:32:34,979 --> 00:32:37,479
- He has a big dream. - I'd say something, but I won't.

783
00:32:38,209 --> 00:32:39,718
He's a restaurateur...

784
00:32:39,719 --> 00:32:41,979
with irresistible charms.

785
00:32:42,389 --> 00:32:46,389
He's the CEO of two Chinese cuisine restaurants in Busan.

786
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,089
He says he has assets amounting...

787
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:51,658
- to eight million dollars. - Did he say eight million dollars?

788
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:53,059
(2: Restaurateur with irresistible charms)

789
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,360
(Busan)

790
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:57,229
(A high-end resort where he lives is revealed.)

791
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,340
I got married in 2011.

792
00:33:01,469 --> 00:33:03,770
My marriage lasted 1 year and 3 months.

793
00:33:03,939 --> 00:33:05,409
I have never smoked a cigarette.

794
00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:07,738
I don't go fishing. I don't play games.

795
00:33:07,739 --> 00:33:09,908
I don't ride motorcycles. I'm good at cleaning.

796
00:33:09,909 --> 00:33:11,350
I don't eat breakfast.

797
00:33:12,649 --> 00:33:14,820
Don't those qualities make me a desirable match?

798
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,448
(Runs 2 restaurants in Busan, assets amount to 8 million dollars)

799
00:33:16,449 --> 00:33:19,689
I'd like to apologize for saying that I wanted a Kim Tae Hee.

800
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,488
I only meant that ladies with such unique appearances...

801
00:33:22,489 --> 00:33:24,459
wouldn't be suitable for me.

802
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,260
I don't want someone who looks like Kim Tae Hee.

803
00:33:27,729 --> 00:33:29,899
- Yes. - Someone just showed him interest.

804
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:33,270
Number 27 from Gentle and Rich, step forward.

805
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,509
Considering the full-body silhouette,

806
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,339
age, and height, he's exceptional.

807
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,340
We need to keep an eye on him too.

808
00:33:43,909 --> 00:33:46,020
(He walks out with a shy smile.)

809
00:33:49,419 --> 00:33:50,449
I'm sorry.

810
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,859
(As soon as he walks out, the votes are withdrawn.)

811
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,829
Number 27 is a dentist who graduated...

812
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,329
from a science high school...

813
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:58,875
and Yonsei University with a degree in Dentistry.

814
00:33:58,899 --> 00:34:00,628
He owns an apartment unit...

815
00:34:00,629 --> 00:34:03,530
- in Yongsan and Banpo. - My gosh.

816
00:34:04,899 --> 00:34:07,398
You know, he's a popular type these days.

817
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:09,908
- Lee Ji Hye's husband, Moon Jae Wan - Right.

818
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:11,516
- is known as the teddy bear type. - The teddy bear type.

819
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,009
That's a popular type nowadays.

820
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:19,079
Actually, I don't have much to do after work.

821
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,179
I don't have hobbies either.

822
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,988
I want to meet a woman who's my type...

823
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:27,219
and marry her in the end.

824
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,689
Is educational background important?

825
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:29,830
Not at all.

826
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,820
- What about her occupation? - I don't care.

827
00:34:32,359 --> 00:34:34,479
- Her assets or annual salary? - I don't care at all.

828
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:35,968
I'm a guy.

829
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:38,209
So I want to meet someone who's my type appearance-wise.

830
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,669
Well, she's the ideal type of many guys.

831
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:44,210
It'd be nice if she resembled Kim Sa Rang.

832
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:48,379
By the way, you went from 10 votes to 2.

833
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,409
Why did that happen?

834
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,819
- All right, the last one. - Lastly, Number 28. Step forward.

835
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:54,920
Hello.

836
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:57,420
(Failing to respond)

837
00:34:57,549 --> 00:35:00,119
Where do you want to go? I'll take you anywhere you want

838
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,559
What do you want to eat? I'll buy you everything

839
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,858
If you're all here on COUPLE PALACE 2,

840
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:06,099
who will guard paradise?

841
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:12,000
You're my angel!

842
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,069
- Thank you. - All right.

843
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,209
We thought that things would be the most competitive...

844
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:19,309
- with Train Gentle and Rich. - Yes.

845
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:21,809
Let me be a good older brother for you and point this out.

846
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:22,810
His assets amount to eight million dollars.

847
00:35:22,811 --> 00:35:25,448
(Assets amounting to 8 million dollars)

848
00:35:25,449 --> 00:35:26,819
- Five million dollars. - Yes.

849
00:35:27,049 --> 00:35:29,019
- He has ten real estate properties. - Right.

850
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,989
This can go from unhappiness to happiness.

851
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,988
(Speaking on their behalf didn't work.)

852
00:35:33,989 --> 00:35:35,960
- It's over. - It's over.

853
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:39,400
(Everyone on Train Gentle and Rich gets 0 votes.)

854
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,369
- This is unexpected. - I thought it'd get competitive.

855
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:43,650
I knew it. It's about the looks.

856
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:46,738
That's so true. The importance of good looks...

857
00:35:46,739 --> 00:35:49,870
has increased significantly when women look for men to date.

858
00:35:54,139 --> 00:35:56,009
Winter feels colder this year.

859
00:35:57,009 --> 00:35:58,880
Right. My goodness.

860
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,649
But it's not over yet. Right?

861
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:03,218
We're just getting started.

862
00:36:03,219 --> 00:36:05,920
My gosh. I think emotionally, it's over.

863
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,229
The next train is here.

864
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,329
(What kind of train is it this time?)

865
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:12,229
(Specialists)

866
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,759
- Specialists. - Specialists.

867
00:36:13,929 --> 00:36:14,960
The marriage market.

868
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:16,370
Specialists.

869
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,669
The only thing that was revealed was the keyword.

870
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,399
What are you writing down?

871
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,770
- Train Specialists. - Did you write, "specialists?"

872
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,509
I wrote, "specialists."

873
00:36:25,739 --> 00:36:27,779
- Why are you writing that down? - I'm curious too.

874
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,309
- As soon as it was revealed, - Yes.

875
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:32,178
They suddenly opened their notebook to look like specialists too.

876
00:36:32,179 --> 00:36:34,620
- We're excited too. - Yes. Specialists.

877
00:36:37,089 --> 00:36:38,289
- Gosh. - My goodness.

878
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:39,519
(Train Specialists has arrived.)

879
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,460
Numbers 19 and 24.

880
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:43,888
(Number 24)

881
00:36:43,889 --> 00:36:46,258
I believe he will get the most votes.

882
00:36:46,259 --> 00:36:47,329
He's not only a complete package,

883
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,000
but a package with a cherry on top.

884
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,000
I really want to take him to my agency.

885
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:53,000
- I want him. - Kidnap him.

886
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:55,469
(Male Number 24 from Train Specialists)

887
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,310
(Coughing)

888
00:36:59,909 --> 00:37:03,080
(He seems to be struggling from the start.)

889
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:06,519
- Given the silhouette... - Not too bad.

890
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,319
- He got four votes. - Yes.

891
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,588
(Coughing)

892
00:37:10,589 --> 00:37:13,719
Let's reveal his condition for marriage.

893
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:15,459
(I can't lift heavy things.)

894
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,158
What? He can't lift heavy things?

895
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:19,459
- "I can't lift heavy things." - My gosh.

896
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,129
- You might end up scolding him. - Right.

897
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,729
- Jong Kook hates this the most. - Right.

898
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:24,829
- I do. Number 24, you're out. - Right.

899
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:26,369
(He's so funny.)

900
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:27,440
Bye.

901
00:37:28,299 --> 00:37:31,310
He keeps losing votes after disclosing his condition.

902
00:37:31,409 --> 00:37:33,710
Not being able to lift heavy things is pretty bad.

903
00:37:34,339 --> 00:37:36,649
- After his condition for marriage, - Yes.

904
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:38,579
I didn't think anyone would pick him.

905
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,349
- But there's someone. - Right.

906
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:42,949
- Someone didn't withdraw her vote. - She didn't.

907
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,589
(Anticipating)

908
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,519
My gosh. I...

909
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,960
My gosh, Number 11...

910
00:37:48,219 --> 00:37:49,589
My gosh, Number 11...

911
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:51,488
She must have forgotten to withdraw her vote.

912
00:37:51,489 --> 00:37:52,528
(She forgot to turn off the light.)

913
00:37:52,529 --> 00:37:53,829
Did you just see that?

914
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:55,199
"Oh, my, why is this still on?"

915
00:37:55,259 --> 00:37:57,299
- "Oh, my, why is this still on?" - That was fast.

916
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:59,469
Oh, no. No one voted for yellow.

917
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:01,968
How bad are you at lifting heavy things?

918
00:38:01,969 --> 00:38:05,539
To be precise, I can lug a small suitcase by myself.

919
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:08,638
But if there's a lot of stuff, I can put them into two suitcases.

920
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:09,750
(Covering her mouth)

921
00:38:10,279 --> 00:38:11,750
That crossed my mind.

922
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:14,079
Then if we were to go on a trip, I'd have to lug the suitcase.

923
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,626
Right. His significant other would have to.

924
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:18,420
I guess you don't like lifting heavy things.

925
00:38:18,549 --> 00:38:20,919
There's a reason people invented wheels.

926
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,359
I can push things.

927
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:24,859
He's a thinking type.

928
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,928
(He's definitely a thinking type.)

929
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:29,229
What's the one thing you can beat the others at from our show?

930
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:32,599
I believe I probably have the fewest mood swings.

931
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,370
Then conversely, what are you not good at?

932
00:38:34,469 --> 00:38:35,968
Being manly or strong.

933
00:38:35,969 --> 00:38:37,108
I'm not good at that.

934
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:39,679
What if your wife asks you to give you a piggyback ride?

935
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:42,108
How about calling an ambulance?

936
00:38:42,109 --> 00:38:43,379
(I don't think I can carry her.)

937
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,448
Gosh, I don't think I can give her a piggyback ride.

938
00:38:45,449 --> 00:38:47,049
No. It's too much for me.

939
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,548
Only their conditions for marriage...

940
00:38:49,549 --> 00:38:50,689
- Yes. - were revealed so far.

941
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:54,290
Number 24 is in third place as he got 0 votes.

942
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,158
But their weapon...

943
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:57,559
- hasn't been revealed yet. - Right.

944
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,698
Let's reveal their faces and qualifications.

945
00:38:59,699 --> 00:39:02,500
- I can't wait. I'm so curious. - I'm so curious.

946
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:07,799
(Number 24's walk-out song: "Gift" by MeloMance)

947
00:39:08,299 --> 00:39:10,009
He's so handsome.

948
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:13,810
He has no energy.

949
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,810
He seems at ease.

950
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,049
- He's handsome. - Right.

951
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,250
But he can't lift heavy things.

952
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,949
Male Number 24 is...

953
00:39:23,219 --> 00:39:25,349
a former golfer on the national team.

954
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:26,888
He's now a dermatologist.

955
00:39:26,889 --> 00:39:28,790
- My gosh. - A dermatologist?

956
00:39:28,989 --> 00:39:30,559
He competed as a professional golfer.

957
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,329
To follow in the footsteps of his father, an ophthalmologist,

958
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:33,999
he became a doctor.

959
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,329
He's suddenly getting votes.

960
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:37,099
No woman would hate dermatologists.

961
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:40,269
He opened a dermatology clinic that is 396m² in size.

962
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:43,008
And he has assets amounting to four million dollars.

963
00:39:43,009 --> 00:39:46,579
He owns four commercial buildings in Seoul.

964
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,638
- He owns four commercial buildings. - My gosh.

965
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:50,149
He's getting more votes.

966
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,449
My gosh. It keeps going up.

967
00:39:52,819 --> 00:39:55,419
Combining his earned income and unearned income,

968
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:58,150
his annual salary is 250,000 dollars.

969
00:39:58,889 --> 00:39:59,988
He doesn't have to lift heavy things.

970
00:39:59,989 --> 00:40:01,620
He'll have people for it.

971
00:40:02,089 --> 00:40:04,329
- The number of votes went up. - The votes...

972
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:06,099
It doesn't matter even if he can't lift heavy things.

973
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,198
"I don't care about saving face."

974
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:09,698
Maybe, he'll have people lifting heavy things for him.

975
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,129
- I guess so. - Right.

976
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:12,769
- There was a reason for it. - Yes.

977
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:14,069
Please introduce yourself.

978
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:21,408
Please press the vote button just this once

979
00:40:21,409 --> 00:40:22,649
(Please)

980
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:24,149
(Press the vote button)

981
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:26,549
(Just this once)

982
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:33,359
Every day, every night, I am missing you

983
00:40:34,219 --> 00:40:35,289
My gosh.

984
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:37,960
- He lost a vote. - Oh, my.

985
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:41,559
A poet named Longfellow once said this.

986
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,400
"Love keeps the cold out better than a cloak."

987
00:40:45,469 --> 00:40:46,839
(How sentimental!)

988
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,569
I'm sensitive to the cold.

989
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,239
(Unexpected)

990
00:40:52,339 --> 00:40:54,880
(Laughing)

991
00:40:55,139 --> 00:40:57,480
I hope to meet my love...

992
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,150
with whom I can spend the winter together. Thank you.

993
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,620
- Great. - That was great.

994
00:41:02,819 --> 00:41:03,819
Number Six?

995
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:07,088
I'm also sensitive to the cold and can't lift heavy things.

996
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:10,729
Are you fine with a woman who's similar to you?

997
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:12,060
One of you has to lift it.

998
00:41:12,529 --> 00:41:15,299
About that, we can use wheels.

999
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:16,830
(His clear answer made her burst into laughter.)

1000
00:41:16,831 --> 00:41:19,170
He loves wheels.

1001
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,968
Number 24, the dermatologist,

1002
00:41:21,969 --> 00:41:24,440
received eight votes, which is a lot.

1003
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:27,440
The professional train, Male Number 19.

1004
00:41:28,909 --> 00:41:30,710
Male Number 19, please introduce yourself.

1005
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:33,819
I graduated earlier this year,

1006
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,520
and I'm currently a pharmacist. I'm Number 19.

1007
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,560
- I like him. - He looks decent.

1008
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:46,000
It's been a little over six months since I started working.

1009
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,799
(The kind pharmacist in the neighborhood)

1010
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,029
I like to read.

1011
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:52,528
Books by philosophers...

1012
00:41:52,529 --> 00:41:55,370
seemed to have greatly affected my worldviews.

1013
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:59,139
For instance, you cannot defy fate.

1014
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:01,108
I believe it's something that you must accept.

1015
00:42:01,109 --> 00:42:02,338
(Things that can't be described)

1016
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:04,980
When I ask my ideal type,

1017
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:08,420
"What do you think destiny is?"

1018
00:42:08,819 --> 00:42:11,419
rather than someone who answers, "Why would you even think that?"

1019
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:13,910
I'd like her to answer, "I think it's this and that."

1020
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,330
I'd be thrilled if she said that.

1021
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,859
Maybe I'll meet...

1022
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:22,059
the woman of my fate.

1023
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,870
(Will I be able to find the woman of my fate here?)

1024
00:42:25,299 --> 00:42:29,440
They turned on the lights for the first 30-second impressions,

1025
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:33,109
and I felt it the moment I saw her.

1026
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:36,179
Her smile, outfit,

1027
00:42:36,279 --> 00:42:39,178
physique, posture, and movements.

1028
00:42:39,179 --> 00:42:41,420
I liked...

1029
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,389
everything about her.

1030
00:42:45,449 --> 00:42:47,620
I could only see one person.

1031
00:42:47,819 --> 00:42:49,859
She was the only one I could see.

1032
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:51,459
I'm so lucky.

1033
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:53,335
(Male Number 19 found his fate at first sight.)

1034
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:57,230
(Who is the woman of his fate?)

1035
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:00,699
Number 19, the pharmacist, received 3 votes.

1036
00:43:00,799 --> 00:43:02,969
It's time to choose your one-on-one date.

1037
00:43:03,069 --> 00:43:04,870
Tell us your first pick.

1038
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:12,210
I'm nervous.

1039
00:43:12,409 --> 00:43:13,420
I was so nervous.

1040
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:17,289
He seemed serious, so I chose him so that I could...

1041
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:19,020
talk to him if I got a chance.

1042
00:43:19,819 --> 00:43:21,689
I prefer those who have specialized jobs,

1043
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:22,889
so he caught my attention.

1044
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:26,060
He had such manly eyes,

1045
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:28,400
and he was close to my ideal type.

1046
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:33,599
Just one woman. I could only see her.

1047
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,540
(Male Number 19 walks with conviction.)

1048
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:37,539
(Who's the woman of his fate?)

1049
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:38,540
Already?

1050
00:43:41,509 --> 00:43:42,509
Already?

1051
00:43:43,279 --> 00:43:44,778
It's Number 13.

1052
00:43:44,779 --> 00:43:48,219
(My first pick is Number 13.)

1053
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:51,190
I could only see her.

1054
00:43:52,049 --> 00:43:53,460
It was Number 13.

1055
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:56,889
Congratulations. You two make a cute couple.

1056
00:43:57,690 --> 00:43:59,610
(Male 19 and Female 13 go on a one-on-one date.)

1057
00:43:59,699 --> 00:44:00,859
I'll take a guess.

1058
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,359
- Sure. - "Romantic."

1059
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:04,230
It's close, but it's a little different.

1060
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:06,138
- "Philosophical?" - Correct.

1061
00:44:06,139 --> 00:44:07,899
(I want to have a philosophical talk about love.)

1062
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,709
I like talking about Lao Tzu's non-action and naturalness,

1063
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:10,738
Confucius, and Mencius.

1064
00:44:10,739 --> 00:44:12,568
I like talking about Lao Tzu's non-action and naturalness...

1065
00:44:12,569 --> 00:44:13,579
(Her eyes widen.)

1066
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,940
- I love Eastern philosophy. - Eastern philosophy.

1067
00:44:16,609 --> 00:44:18,609
- Do you? - A human's greed...

1068
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:20,448
is limitless, so you shouldn't look for happiness...

1069
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:22,749
- from materialistic things. - That's true.

1070
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:24,349
I was deeply inspired by that,

1071
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:26,195
so I stopped looking for happiness in materialistic things.

1072
00:44:26,219 --> 00:44:27,920
- I try not to buy things. - I'm the same.

1073
00:44:28,219 --> 00:44:29,289
That's not...

1074
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:30,358
- where happiness comes from. - It's not.

1075
00:44:30,359 --> 00:44:31,658
It comes from inner peace.

1076
00:44:31,659 --> 00:44:33,460
You're right. How did you...

1077
00:44:34,029 --> 00:44:35,029
I was in trouble.

1078
00:44:35,799 --> 00:44:37,000
We're too compatible.

1079
00:44:38,469 --> 00:44:39,540
No?

1080
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,940
I read books about Buddhism...

1081
00:44:41,139 --> 00:44:42,770
Liberation, affliction, and nirvana.

1082
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:44,338
It talks about being a noble person...

1083
00:44:44,339 --> 00:44:46,309
and how a great person and a petty person are.

1084
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:47,856
I also like "The Analects of Confucius."

1085
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,909
Yes. That's exactly what I mean.

1086
00:44:51,509 --> 00:44:54,379
I found it fascinating that there was someone...

1087
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:55,826
with whom I have such great communication.

1088
00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:59,319
(They both felt fated.)

1089
00:45:00,259 --> 00:45:03,060
Train numbers 7 and 8.

1090
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:04,159
Boyish charm.

1091
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:06,359
That makes my heart flutter.

1092
00:45:06,699 --> 00:45:08,459
There are lots of women who are into boyish charms.

1093
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:09,460
I'm one of them.

1094
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:13,869
There are many women who are...

1095
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:14,899
- into boyish charms. - There are.

1096
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,810
I can't date a guy with boyish charms.

1097
00:45:16,909 --> 00:45:18,370
This one's a no-go.

1098
00:45:18,739 --> 00:45:20,459
- Do you like those types? - Boyish charms.

1099
00:45:20,909 --> 00:45:22,440
Me neither. I'm not really into them.

1100
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:25,278
The keyword "boyish charms" were...

1101
00:45:25,279 --> 00:45:28,049
the ones that I was the most uninterested in.

1102
00:45:28,219 --> 00:45:29,619
I expected them to be really young.

1103
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:30,920
(Boyish charms)

1104
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:34,889
(An entrance that meets the expectations of his keyword)

1105
00:45:36,989 --> 00:45:38,330
(What made them laugh so hard?)

1106
00:45:38,429 --> 00:45:41,529
Boyish charms.

1107
00:45:42,029 --> 00:45:44,599
- They certainly look different. - Yes.

1108
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,769
They're trying so hard to look like boys.

1109
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:48,500
(We're the world's best boys.)

1110
00:45:48,699 --> 00:45:50,440
- It is cute. - It is.

1111
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,040
Now, conditions for marriage.

1112
00:45:54,041 --> 00:45:55,409
- Let's check it out. - Yes.

1113
00:45:55,909 --> 00:45:58,380
"I want a woman who's older and is ready to get married."

1114
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,795
"I want a woman who will understand my nationwide job rotation."

1115
00:46:00,819 --> 00:46:02,279
It must have something to do...

1116
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:03,690
- Yes. - with his job.

1117
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:07,120
My company has...

1118
00:46:07,819 --> 00:46:10,989
branches all over the country, so...

1119
00:46:11,089 --> 00:46:12,830
He's got a nice voice.

1120
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,299
- I should change it. - I like his voice.

1121
00:46:16,199 --> 00:46:17,798
He gained two more votes.

1122
00:46:17,799 --> 00:46:19,428
I know, right? It's probably his voice.

1123
00:46:19,429 --> 00:46:21,339
- He gained more votes. - He did.

1124
00:46:22,069 --> 00:46:23,108
Here are his qualifications.

1125
00:46:23,109 --> 00:46:24,870
(Male Number 1's looks and qualifications)

1126
00:46:25,339 --> 00:46:26,809
(He chose "I Mean, I Like You" by Pa! nter.)

1127
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:27,839
He's handsome.

1128
00:46:30,549 --> 00:46:32,909
- He's good-looking. - He's got the looks.

1129
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:34,679
I like him.

1130
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:37,489
I love good-looking men.

1131
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:39,695
(His height and good looks make them change their picks.)

1132
00:46:39,719 --> 00:46:42,818
Male Number One is a public sector worker...

1133
00:46:42,819 --> 00:46:44,630
with a romantic soul.

1134
00:46:45,429 --> 00:46:47,630
He gained more votes after revealing his face.

1135
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,829
Next, Male Number 18.

1136
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:51,545
(Revealing Male Number 18's looks and qualifications)

1137
00:46:51,569 --> 00:46:52,630
He's good-looking.

1138
00:46:53,969 --> 00:46:56,170
(A fire show to get their votes)

1139
00:46:57,109 --> 00:46:58,109
(Amazed)

1140
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:00,278
Male Number 18 is a manager at a lounge bar...

1141
00:47:00,279 --> 00:47:01,739
with a romantic heart.

1142
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,249
(He loses his votes after his qualifications are revealed.)

1143
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:05,890
You lost three votes after the fire show.

1144
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:07,880
What's the name of the bar?

1145
00:47:08,049 --> 00:47:10,289
I can't exactly say the name...

1146
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:13,489
in public.

1147
00:47:14,259 --> 00:47:15,959
- Not in public? - No.

1148
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,666
(He couldn't say the name as it's PG-rated.)

1149
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:19,659
Male Number 18 didn't get any votes.

1150
00:47:20,859 --> 00:47:21,859
Manly men.

1151
00:47:23,029 --> 00:47:24,769
These are men who are...

1152
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:27,069
the opposite of the guys with boyish charms.

1153
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:29,190
It must be fun to see them while comparing them.

1154
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,069
They're manly men.

1155
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:32,940
I'm excited to see them.

1156
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:34,579
Your juniors will be here.

1157
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:36,350
I bet they will.

1158
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:39,250
On the manly men train are Male Numbers 17 and 5.

1159
00:47:39,679 --> 00:47:42,219
Is he holding a gun to his head or is he saluting?

1160
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:43,718
If it's a salute, you're doing it wrong.

1161
00:47:43,719 --> 00:47:45,119
I think it's a gun.

1162
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,436
- It's a gun! - He's saying it's a gun.

1163
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:47,620
It was a gun!

1164
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:50,130
Isn't that too intense?

1165
00:47:51,429 --> 00:47:54,159
- It's what rappers usually do. - Will that work on women?

1166
00:47:55,299 --> 00:47:56,499
He's not getting any votes.

1167
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:57,569
(But...)

1168
00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:00,370
Male Number 17, please step forward.

1169
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:02,198
(He chose...)

1170
00:48:02,199 --> 00:48:03,679
("Cries and Whispers" by Lee Ji Soo.)

1171
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:05,810
He's masculine.

1172
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:11,980
Oh, he is a manly man.

1173
00:48:13,719 --> 00:48:14,980
He looks reliable, doesn't he?

1174
00:48:20,219 --> 00:48:21,419
(A forward roll)

1175
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:23,129
That scared me. I thought he tripped.

1176
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:24,460
I thought so too.

1177
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:26,929
- That was planned, right? - Yes.

1178
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:29,259
I've been serving the country,

1179
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:32,528
and I'm here to find the woman who I will serve.

1180
00:48:32,529 --> 00:48:34,370
I'm Number 17, a manly man.

1181
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:36,770
I've been through a lot,

1182
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,739
so join me on the smooth sailing from now on.

1183
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,809
(Male Number 17 is unexpectedly cute.)

1184
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:45,650
- Sure. - Sure.

1185
00:48:45,949 --> 00:48:48,349
- A manly man... - Yes.

1186
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:49,350
Getting nervous at moments like this...

1187
00:48:49,351 --> 00:48:51,319
- Indeed. - makes him more attractive.

1188
00:48:52,089 --> 00:48:54,219
Lastly, Male Number Five, please step forward.

1189
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,289
(He chose "Love" by Keyshia Cole.)

1190
00:48:57,290 --> 00:48:59,659
(He chose "Love" by Keyshia Cole.)

1191
00:49:00,299 --> 00:49:01,630
He seems familiar.

1192
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:04,730
I feel like I've seen him.

1193
00:49:05,299 --> 00:49:06,399
He seemed familiar.

1194
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,520
(He looks familiar to them.)

1195
00:49:08,139 --> 00:49:09,170
He's hip.

1196
00:49:10,609 --> 00:49:13,008
An introverted rapper and a good homemaker,

1197
00:49:13,009 --> 00:49:14,380
Male Number Five.

1198
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:17,150
He's been a rapper for ten years.

1199
00:49:17,509 --> 00:49:20,150
"A rapper and a good homemaker." That's pretty funny.

1200
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:21,519
He was on "Show Me the Money" too.

1201
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,520
That's a surprise.

1202
00:49:22,521 --> 00:49:25,620
Hello, I'm Lee Ki Taek, and I'm 34 years old.

1203
00:49:25,719 --> 00:49:28,759
And my rapper name is Mckdaddy.

1204
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:31,859
(He was on "Show Me the Money 8" and "Show Me the Money 9.")

1205
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:34,730
(A recognized, skilled rapper)

1206
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:35,910
(Can you hold your liquor?)

1207
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:37,130
No, I can't.

1208
00:49:37,131 --> 00:49:39,251
(He has surprising charms, unlike his intense looks.)

1209
00:49:40,069 --> 00:49:41,069
What's wrong?

1210
00:49:41,339 --> 00:49:43,000
It feels so awkward that I'm here.

1211
00:49:43,969 --> 00:49:44,969
I mostly stay at home.

1212
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:46,739
I play with my cat,

1213
00:49:47,139 --> 00:49:49,339
and I make music at home.

1214
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:51,449
I also like to cook.

1215
00:49:51,909 --> 00:49:54,549
I actually had a YouTube channel where I posted my cooking videos.

1216
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,889
I'm confident that I won't let my family starve.

1217
00:49:58,049 --> 00:49:59,150
I want to get married.

1218
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,388
I'm sure a lot of people think that I lived a wild life...

1219
00:50:02,389 --> 00:50:05,830
because I'm a rapper,

1220
00:50:05,929 --> 00:50:08,000
but if you keep an open mind and approach me,

1221
00:50:08,299 --> 00:50:10,129
you'll get to find out...

1222
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:12,370
how sensitive I am on the inside.

1223
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:14,669
Number Five, we hear that you prepared...

1224
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:16,170
- something for us. - Yes.

1225
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:18,138
I wanted to show them what I'm best at.

1226
00:50:18,139 --> 00:50:20,139
- Let's hear it. - All right.

1227
00:50:21,139 --> 00:50:22,338
("Been Up, Been Down, Been Back" by Mckdaddy)

1228
00:50:22,339 --> 00:50:24,480
(You ask me if I can't buy happiness)

1229
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:28,079
(Unless I get rich, and I won't be able to answer)

1230
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:31,048
(That's all, I never dreamed to be a clown in the middle of gossip)

1231
00:50:31,049 --> 00:50:33,588
(Times may have changed but my romance is in your earphones)

1232
00:50:33,589 --> 00:50:35,419
(This is how I live, I keep learning)

1233
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:38,290
(How to keep going where I'm facing I know my limits)

1234
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:43,229
Thank you.

1235
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:45,569
(Clapping)

1236
00:50:46,029 --> 00:50:48,040
You just got two votes.

1237
00:50:48,969 --> 00:50:50,040
Number Two.

1238
00:50:50,409 --> 00:50:52,468
Number Five,

1239
00:50:52,469 --> 00:50:56,580
I wonder if you were on "Show Me the Money."

1240
00:50:56,909 --> 00:50:57,979
Yes, I was.

1241
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:00,719
Then, were you recently on "RAP: PUBLIC..."

1242
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:02,649
- as well? - Yes, I was.

1243
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:04,049
You were?

1244
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:06,659
- What did you say? - I'm sorry?

1245
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:10,158
You were also on "RAP: PUBLIC?"

1246
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:12,190
- He was. - You were?

1247
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,259
- What's going on? - But...

1248
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:17,298
(Is there...)

1249
00:51:17,299 --> 00:51:18,568
(a problem?)

1250
00:51:18,569 --> 00:51:21,040
- I'm a huge fan. - Really?

1251
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:22,798
I'm a huge fan.

1252
00:51:22,799 --> 00:51:23,869
(Proud)

1253
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:27,210
Yes, so I was wondering if he was the rapper I had in mind.

1254
00:51:27,609 --> 00:51:29,489
How do you not recognize him if you're his fan?

1255
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:31,448
(Female Number 2 is nervous in front of her favorite.)

1256
00:51:31,449 --> 00:51:32,679
I guess she's not a fan.

1257
00:51:33,279 --> 00:51:34,999
Maybe you look very different in real life.

1258
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:37,448
I changed my style a bit.

1259
00:51:37,449 --> 00:51:38,519
- I see. - Did you?

1260
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,849
What was your previous style?

1261
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:42,459
- I used to be blonde. - That's right!

1262
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:44,290
- Was he? - Yes.

1263
00:51:44,359 --> 00:51:46,329
- Is it him? - Yes, it is him.

1264
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:48,359
Are you sure it's him?

1265
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,068
- Yes, I am. - Are you?

1266
00:51:50,069 --> 00:51:51,199
- Is it him? - Yes.

1267
00:51:51,529 --> 00:51:54,569
Goodness. She met a true fan.

1268
00:51:54,799 --> 00:51:56,139
What if they get married?

1269
00:51:56,810 --> 00:51:58,870
(Another woman who picked Male Number 5.)

1270
00:51:59,139 --> 00:52:00,179
Oh, no.

1271
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:02,579
Number 24, do you...

1272
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:04,049
(Do you recognize him?)

1273
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,548
I'm sorry.

1274
00:52:06,549 --> 00:52:07,678
I've never...

1275
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:09,149
I'll get to know him.

1276
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:10,250
- Sure. - All right.

1277
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,318
Number Five will go first.

1278
00:52:13,319 --> 00:52:14,960
- Choose your first pick! - Go!

1279
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,789
(Male Number 5 walks with light steps.)

1280
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:17,929
Of the two...

1281
00:52:18,359 --> 00:52:19,359
(Bowing)

1282
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,429
Hang on.

1283
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,999
(Is he choosing Female Number 24?)

1284
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,069
Let's see.

1285
00:52:27,569 --> 00:52:30,239
Oh, no. Hang on.

1286
00:52:31,639 --> 00:52:33,479
Wait. What's happening?

1287
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:34,638
- He bowed, and... - Okay.

1288
00:52:34,639 --> 00:52:36,408
I'll go with Number Two.

1289
00:52:36,409 --> 00:52:37,549
- Number Two. - Number Two.

1290
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:40,519
His first pick is Number Two.

1291
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,679
- Yes. - That's his first pick.

1292
00:52:43,549 --> 00:52:45,020
He had zero votes, and...

1293
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:46,959
Number 24.

1294
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:47,988
- Can I cancel it now? - No.

1295
00:52:47,989 --> 00:52:49,718
- You can't cancel it. - It's too late.

1296
00:52:49,719 --> 00:52:50,960
Why did he have to bow?

1297
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:56,159
A true fan and her star met on a dating show.

1298
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:58,130
Good luck.

1299
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:00,838
Can we read this?

1300
00:53:00,839 --> 00:53:02,999
(Male Number 5 and Female Number 2's 1-on-1 date)

1301
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,809
This feels like a meet-and-greet.

1302
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:05,939
Come on.

1303
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:07,940
We've been matched just now.

1304
00:53:08,609 --> 00:53:11,080
- This is fascinating. - What's your ideal type,

1305
00:53:12,409 --> 00:53:13,620
appearance-wise?

1306
00:53:13,819 --> 00:53:15,049
- Appearance-wise? - Yes.

1307
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:18,620
I believe a man should look...

1308
00:53:19,219 --> 00:53:21,290
fierce.

1309
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:23,190
(That's me.)

1310
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:24,960
(Nodding)

1311
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:28,658
What do you think about your future spouse...

1312
00:53:28,659 --> 00:53:29,659
Yes.

1313
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,600
Wanting to have a meal with his mother once a week?

1314
00:53:32,929 --> 00:53:34,670
Once a week.

1315
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:38,108
I'm sorry, but I can't believe I'm marrying Mckdaddy.

1316
00:53:38,109 --> 00:53:39,585
(She's got no sense of reality at the moment.)

1317
00:53:39,609 --> 00:53:42,479
We've been matched with marriage in mind.

1318
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,778
I'm just so fascinated.

1319
00:53:43,779 --> 00:53:47,719
I tend to respect people...

1320
00:53:48,179 --> 00:53:50,150
who are older than me.

1321
00:53:50,549 --> 00:53:51,690
So, I'd love that.

1322
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:53,560
- I'd like that. - Really?

1323
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:55,020
You're so upright.

1324
00:53:57,730 --> 00:53:58,790
I think I know what it is.

1325
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,659
What is it?

1326
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:03,468
"I want to be a DINK couple or a couple with one child."

1327
00:54:03,469 --> 00:54:05,028
(The woman's hidden condition)

1328
00:54:05,029 --> 00:54:06,029
Sorry about that.

1329
00:54:07,339 --> 00:54:08,939
- Yes? - It must be something...

1330
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:10,740
- like a specialized job. - How did you know?

1331
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:12,370
Oh, it's about jobs.

1332
00:54:13,370 --> 00:54:15,309
(So, you like men with specialized jobs.)

1333
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:16,339
Yes.

1334
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:18,810
I wonder what the other one is.

1335
00:54:20,009 --> 00:54:21,329
Can you tell me the second blank?

1336
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:22,480
- This? - Yes.

1337
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:24,219
It's "CEO."

1338
00:54:24,949 --> 00:54:26,319
(Dropping his head)

1339
00:54:28,089 --> 00:54:30,089
She wanted a man with a specialized job or a CEO.

1340
00:54:30,759 --> 00:54:32,690
But I'm neither.

1341
00:54:33,089 --> 00:54:34,759
I felt so small.

1342
00:54:35,859 --> 00:54:37,999
Let's think about it seriously.

1343
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,870
- We've been matched, after all. - Yes.

1344
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,721
Would you be willing to marry a guy with a job like mine?

1345
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:44,838
Be serious.

1346
00:54:44,839 --> 00:54:46,009
- Be serious? - Yes.

1347
00:54:46,810 --> 00:54:47,909
But I...

1348
00:54:50,179 --> 00:54:51,948
believe that being a rapper is also a specialized job.

1349
00:54:51,949 --> 00:54:53,749
You're one of the best in your own field,

1350
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:55,620
and you're in the top one percent.

1351
00:54:56,219 --> 00:54:57,749
Of course, you have a specialized job.

1352
00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:00,989
You worked hard in your own field...

1353
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:03,319
and got to where you are now.

1354
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:04,729
So, I don't think it matters.

1355
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:06,876
- It's just a different field. - So, you'd be willing to marry?

1356
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,528
- Yes. - Really?

1357
00:55:08,529 --> 00:55:09,560
Yes.

1358
00:55:09,830 --> 00:55:11,400
She seems so upright.

1359
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:13,029
I filled the whole card.

1360
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:15,040
The whole card.

1361
00:55:15,139 --> 00:55:16,940
It was fun. It made me happy.

1362
00:55:17,469 --> 00:55:19,170
It felt like I was dreaming.

1363
00:55:19,469 --> 00:55:22,810
I've always been a fan of his,

1364
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,449
and it was so fascinating and surprising.

1365
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:28,779
"I can't believe this is happening." That was on my mind.

1366
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:31,889
I pressed the heart button.

1367
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:36,020
Which keyword was the most threatening?

1368
00:55:36,159 --> 00:55:37,989
"A 188cm tall guy who's as big as a door."

1369
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:40,759
I have a feeling that he'll win by a landslide with his physique.

1370
00:55:41,259 --> 00:55:43,219
If I met the conditions, I would want the phrase,

1371
00:55:43,259 --> 00:55:46,529
"a 188cm-tall guy who's as big as a door."

1372
00:55:46,730 --> 00:55:48,299
To compare myself to a door,

1373
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:51,170
I'd be as big as a door of a mini-fridge.

1374
00:55:51,670 --> 00:55:52,968
("A 188cm-tall guy who's as big as a door" is...)

1375
00:55:52,969 --> 00:55:54,238
(a keyword that every guy wants.)

1376
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:56,380
I don't really like the keyword, though.

1377
00:55:57,549 --> 00:55:58,549
It sounds too...

1378
00:56:00,049 --> 00:56:01,319
lame.

1379
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:04,948
Here comes the next train.

1380
00:56:04,949 --> 00:56:06,149
(Who's Male Number 26 that's not satisfied with his keyword?)

1381
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:08,359
"A 188cm-tall guy who's as big as a door."

1382
00:56:08,889 --> 00:56:11,489
- Number 26 has headphones... - Yes.

1383
00:56:11,929 --> 00:56:13,529
He must be a DJ.

1384
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,529
How would you feel if your boyfriend was a DJ?

1385
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:18,170
I'd hate it.

1386
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:21,339
Let's see how they react after his qualifications are up.

1387
00:56:22,739 --> 00:56:24,370
(It's showtime.)

1388
00:56:25,009 --> 00:56:27,909
(Number 26 shows incredible DJ skills.)

1389
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,210
Is he doing it himself?

1390
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:31,980
He's good-looking, though.

1391
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:34,279
- I bet he'll be popular. - That's hot.

1392
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:39,019
(He looks a bit awkward as he walks in, )

1393
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,460
(and the women smile.)

1394
00:56:40,819 --> 00:56:41,919
(He's actually as big as a door.)

1395
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,190
He's tall.

1396
00:56:43,659 --> 00:56:45,190
I like his looks.

1397
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:47,230
Number 26 is...

1398
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:50,159
a patent agent and an attorney who's also a DJ.

1399
00:56:50,529 --> 00:56:52,569
- He earns 120,000 dollars? - Seriously?

1400
00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:54,500
A patent agent and an attorney.

1401
00:56:55,139 --> 00:56:56,298
After passing the bar exam,

1402
00:56:56,299 --> 00:56:58,068
he graduated from KAIST-MIP...

1403
00:56:58,069 --> 00:56:59,749
and got his certificate as a patent agent.

1404
00:57:00,109 --> 00:57:03,139
His surprising hobby is DJing at night.

1405
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:06,879
Hi, I have two licenses...

1406
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,948
as a lawyer and a patent agent.

1407
00:57:08,949 --> 00:57:10,948
I'm currently working in the patent field.

1408
00:57:10,949 --> 00:57:12,549
I'm Male Number 26.

1409
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:14,388
If he has a license for a patent agent and a lawyer,

1410
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:16,119
he'll be unbeatable in the patent industry.

1411
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,559
(A thumbs-up)

1412
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:20,529
Did you play the music just now?

1413
00:57:21,299 --> 00:57:23,130
- No, I didn't. - No?

1414
00:57:23,299 --> 00:57:25,229
(He shyly confesses that he was pretending.)

1415
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:26,298
It looked so real.

1416
00:57:26,299 --> 00:57:28,139
I like your honesty.

1417
00:57:28,699 --> 00:57:33,238
(This man is even capable of DJing in the air.)

1418
00:57:33,239 --> 00:57:34,959
What do you think about your train keyword?

1419
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,250
I don't like it.

1420
00:57:37,909 --> 00:57:41,650
I thought I'd be on a different train.

1421
00:57:42,219 --> 00:57:45,889
Specialists or Gentle and Rich.

1422
00:57:47,259 --> 00:57:49,119
So, when I first got my keyword,

1423
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:52,029
I reckoned I'd be number one.

1424
00:57:52,259 --> 00:57:53,259
And...

1425
00:57:53,429 --> 00:57:55,199
Here are the top three.

1426
00:57:56,299 --> 00:57:57,299
Look at that.

1427
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:01,100
Watching the top three males of the first impression vote,

1428
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,709
I wasn't that glad.

1429
00:58:03,710 --> 00:58:06,839
But as I watched them closely,

1430
00:58:07,239 --> 00:58:09,079
I knew I'd beat them with the lights on.

1431
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:11,310
(I'd beat them with the lights on.)

1432
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:15,920
(Is there a woman who can captivate this confident man?)

1433
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:19,719
Let's find out about their conditions for marriage.

1434
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,560
(The most surprising condition)

1435
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:22,920
(Gasping)

1436
00:58:22,921 --> 00:58:23,928
(What did I just see?)

1437
00:58:23,929 --> 00:58:25,129
(Speechless)

1438
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:27,199
(This condition for marriage shocked everyone.)

1439
00:58:28,859 --> 00:58:30,060
Are you sure?

1440
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:33,298
(He thinks for 3 seconds.)

1441
00:58:33,299 --> 00:58:34,299
(Scoffing)

1442
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:35,500
I'll give it a shot.

1443
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:36,939
(Male Number 26 has decided.)

1444
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:38,516
(What's the condition for marriage that made everyone fluster?)

1445
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:41,838
(I want a matrimonial home of 2 million dollars or more.)

1446
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:43,710
Two million dollars?

1447
00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:46,409
- Two million dollars or more? - Number Nine.

1448
00:58:46,609 --> 00:58:47,619
Sorry.

1449
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:49,549
Can you meet that condition?

1450
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:52,019
I don't think I can.

1451
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:53,120
Two million dollars?

1452
00:58:53,319 --> 00:58:54,489
Two million dollars.

1453
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:56,266
(This man smiles brightly after seeing the condition.)

1454
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:58,028
Number Nine wants...

1455
00:58:58,029 --> 00:59:00,190
A matrimonial home of two million dollars or more.

1456
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:03,470
My condition is a matrimonial home of two million dollars or more.

1457
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:05,669
If you were to live in the US,

1458
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:09,199
are you considering getting a mortgage loan?

1459
00:59:09,699 --> 00:59:11,139
You're very specific.

1460
00:59:11,969 --> 00:59:16,139
I want my matrimonial home to be worth at least two million dollars.

1461
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:19,449
I don't think love is everything.

1462
00:59:19,810 --> 00:59:23,278
I believe that you can be in a happy marriage...

1463
00:59:23,279 --> 00:59:25,719
with some financial stability.

1464
00:59:25,889 --> 00:59:28,088
Most men aren't enough for me,

1465
00:59:28,089 --> 00:59:29,858
so I'm not dating anyone.

1466
00:59:29,859 --> 00:59:34,560
When I talked about marriage with my first boyfriend,

1467
00:59:34,699 --> 00:59:37,529
the matrimonial house that he got for us was...

1468
00:59:37,969 --> 00:59:40,400
over two million dollars a few years back.

1469
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:42,839
I don't want to live in a house that's cheaper than that.

1470
00:59:43,139 --> 00:59:45,609
If he has a fortune to inherit in the future,

1471
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:46,939
he can just make 10,000 dollars a month.

1472
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:49,100
So he needs to earn more if he won't inherit anything.

1473
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:50,509
Yes, that's right.

1474
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:53,149
(Female Number 9 has clear conditions for marriage.)

1475
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:55,250
I realized that I might not be able to meet that.

1476
00:59:55,819 --> 00:59:56,919
What is that?

1477
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,388
Two million dollars or more?

1478
00:59:58,389 --> 00:59:59,589
Can you afford that?

1479
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,790
(But Male Number 26 hasn't given up.)

1480
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:05,159
You currently have one vote.

1481
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:07,199
In Round One,

1482
01:00:07,799 --> 01:00:11,100
I saw that she picked me.

1483
01:00:11,569 --> 01:00:14,400
A patent agent and attorney who's also a DJ!

1484
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,238
She left an impression on me.

1485
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:19,669
(Female Number 9 left an impression on Male Number 26 in Round 1.)

1486
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:21,779
I was curious about Female Number Nine.

1487
01:00:22,839 --> 01:00:25,609
We'll now reveal her looks and qualifications.

1488
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:29,750
(She picked "Gimme More" by Britney Spears.)

1489
01:00:30,350 --> 01:00:32,350
- She looks like a Burberry model. - She's pretty.

1490
01:00:42,359 --> 01:00:44,499
Female Number Nine is...

1491
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:46,580
an open-minded company worker working for company S.

1492
01:00:46,770 --> 01:00:48,870
Her annual salary is around 70,000 dollars.

1493
01:00:48,969 --> 01:00:51,239
She owns a villa in Seoul.

1494
01:00:53,770 --> 01:00:57,448
Her looks, which didn't match being a conglomerate employee,

1495
01:00:57,449 --> 01:00:59,179
left a strong impression.

1496
01:00:59,279 --> 01:01:02,179
What I watched closely was her heels.

1497
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:06,719
I think she wore one that matched her perfectly.

1498
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,459
Right. Hi.

1499
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:09,460
(9: An open-minded company S worker who studied abroad)

1500
01:01:09,461 --> 01:01:12,790
I studied abroad for about 15 years,

1501
01:01:12,929 --> 01:01:15,730
so my Korean used to be awkward.

1502
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:20,599
As I have lived abroad ever since I was little,

1503
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:23,138
I prefer international students.

1504
01:01:23,139 --> 01:01:25,269
With my passion for cooking,

1505
01:01:25,270 --> 01:01:28,139
just bring home bacon,

1506
01:01:28,639 --> 01:01:29,940
and dinner is on me.

1507
01:01:30,679 --> 01:01:33,008
Due to my bleached hair,

1508
01:01:33,009 --> 01:01:35,948
I'm sure many have misunderstood.

1509
01:01:35,949 --> 01:01:37,888
No. It's because of the loan.

1510
01:01:37,889 --> 01:01:39,548
Are you considering getting a mortgage loan?

1511
01:01:39,549 --> 01:01:42,920
I'm confident in becoming the cutest and hottest partner.

1512
01:01:43,489 --> 01:01:44,659
Are you fine with it?

1513
01:01:45,889 --> 01:01:47,900
(Thinking deeply)

1514
01:01:48,929 --> 01:01:49,960
I'll give it a shot.

1515
01:01:50,259 --> 01:01:51,429
(Declaring to drive forward)

1516
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:53,468
Tell us your first pick.

1517
01:01:53,469 --> 01:01:56,170
(Female Number 9 makes her first pick!)

1518
01:01:58,639 --> 01:02:01,710
I actually picked Number 26...

1519
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:03,879
in Round One.

1520
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:06,408
But Number 26...

1521
01:02:06,409 --> 01:02:08,548
didn't pick me.

1522
01:02:08,549 --> 01:02:12,749
Honestly, if I'm not the first option,

1523
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:16,620
I refrain even more from approaching first.

1524
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:18,560
So...

1525
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:22,659
I might not get picked.

1526
01:02:24,969 --> 01:02:29,069
(Will Female Number 9 pick Male Number 26?)

1527
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:31,408
Would you like to go DJing?

1528
01:02:31,409 --> 01:02:35,309
(Would you like to go DJing?)

1529
01:02:35,310 --> 01:02:38,309
Gosh, he's the patent agent who's also a DJ.

1530
01:02:38,310 --> 01:02:39,548
The DJ.

1531
01:02:39,549 --> 01:02:41,349
He can totally get the matrimonial home.

1532
01:02:41,350 --> 01:02:44,718
Let's go enjoy a sound party.

1533
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:45,719
(Female Number 9 and Male Number 26 are matched.)

1534
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,560
- The two look good together. - I agree.

1535
01:02:48,759 --> 01:02:51,289
What were you going to do if you didn't get any votes?

1536
01:02:51,290 --> 01:02:52,559
I was going to sulk.

1537
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:55,299
I was already unhappy because you didn't pick me yesterday.

1538
01:02:56,830 --> 01:02:57,830
Yesterday...

1539
01:02:58,630 --> 01:03:01,369
I was too nervous and was all over the place.

1540
01:03:01,370 --> 01:03:03,238
Did I not stand out to you?

1541
01:03:03,239 --> 01:03:04,608
(Was my blonde hair not visible?)

1542
01:03:04,609 --> 01:03:06,008
- I stand out a lot. - I mean,

1543
01:03:06,009 --> 01:03:08,138
I could only see your hair.

1544
01:03:08,139 --> 01:03:10,279
I'm sorry, but can I walk on the other side?

1545
01:03:10,409 --> 01:03:12,779
This is my better profile.

1546
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:15,649
As my right side looks better, I'll walk on this side.

1547
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:17,920
Nice. What a perfect match.

1548
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:21,959
(Will their date be perfect as well?)

1549
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:23,020
Hi.

1550
01:03:23,759 --> 01:03:24,759
Hi.

1551
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:26,089
(The 1-on-1 date begins.)

1552
01:03:26,290 --> 01:03:27,599
Did you graduate from...

1553
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:30,198
- I graduated from... - Australia?

1554
01:03:30,199 --> 01:03:31,269
(Australia?)

1555
01:03:31,270 --> 01:03:32,599
- Where? - Australia.

1556
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,799
No. That was another person.

1557
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:40,940
You seemed about 180cm tall.

1558
01:03:42,009 --> 01:03:44,109
I'm 188cm tall.

1559
01:03:44,609 --> 01:03:46,049
You're really tall.

1560
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:48,849
My keyword yesterday was...

1561
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:50,649
a 188cm tall guy who's as big as a door.

1562
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:52,049
Were you there yesterday?

1563
01:03:52,589 --> 01:03:53,888
I can't recall.

1564
01:03:53,889 --> 01:03:55,059
(I can't recall.)

1565
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:56,989
(Am I not the one she remembers?)

1566
01:03:57,460 --> 01:03:59,588
- Your job... - Do you remember my job?

1567
01:03:59,589 --> 01:04:01,299
- A patent agent and an attorney. - Yes.

1568
01:04:01,429 --> 01:04:02,929
(Feeling happy)

1569
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:05,129
- Do you know "SUITS?" - I do.

1570
01:04:05,130 --> 01:04:07,229
I really enjoyed that show.

1571
01:04:07,230 --> 01:04:09,338
Was there a patent agent in there?

1572
01:04:09,339 --> 01:04:11,408
Which one is higher, your EQ or IQ?

1573
01:04:11,409 --> 01:04:13,169
Do you speed drive?

1574
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:16,838
What are your thoughts about a partner with the opposite tendency?

1575
01:04:16,839 --> 01:04:19,150
Do you also enjoy music festivals?

1576
01:04:19,449 --> 01:04:20,449
Where do you live?

1577
01:04:20,450 --> 01:04:24,419
When I lived with my parents, it was Yeouido.

1578
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:26,750
My parents live in Bucheon.

1579
01:04:27,089 --> 01:04:29,120
It's close to Yeouido.

1580
01:04:29,759 --> 01:04:31,158
Is it?

1581
01:04:31,159 --> 01:04:33,330
Yes. It's really close, about 20 minutes by car.

1582
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:36,330
I thought she was eating me alive.

1583
01:04:37,469 --> 01:04:41,639
Number Nine made really good eye contact.

1584
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:44,468
She gave off a non-Korean vibe.

1585
01:04:44,469 --> 01:04:46,839
She was very outgoing.

1586
01:04:47,540 --> 01:04:50,580
I felt uncomfortable to the point that I couldn't

1587
01:04:51,279 --> 01:04:53,210
look straight into her eyes.

1588
01:04:53,449 --> 01:04:55,519
- What about property? - A property? Do you own a property?

1589
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:56,920
It's not worth two million dollars.

1590
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:59,350
Not owning one right now is fine,

1591
01:04:59,589 --> 01:05:01,120
as long as you're competent.

1592
01:05:01,319 --> 01:05:04,389
So you're fine as long as your partner has the ability...

1593
01:05:04,929 --> 01:05:07,358
to buy a two-million-dollar property.

1594
01:05:07,359 --> 01:05:08,698
As long as he has the potential.

1595
01:05:08,699 --> 01:05:11,299
I find such a person charming.

1596
01:05:11,469 --> 01:05:12,770
I have...

1597
01:05:14,139 --> 01:05:15,299
confidence.

1598
01:05:16,170 --> 01:05:17,170
That's all that matters.

1599
01:05:19,370 --> 01:05:23,379
My gosh. I don't remember meeting anyone who is 188cm tall before.

1600
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:24,778
It was cool.

1601
01:05:24,779 --> 01:05:26,379
He lives in Gangnam.

1602
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:28,818
He's an attorney and a patent agent. Good.

1603
01:05:28,819 --> 01:05:30,379
Job-wise, he passes.

1604
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:32,419
He has two Master's degrees.

1605
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:33,488
That was cool.

1606
01:05:33,489 --> 01:05:34,718
His annual income wasn't bad either.

1607
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:36,218
He wasn't prepared yet...

1608
01:05:36,219 --> 01:05:39,129
but was confident in his capability and potential.

1609
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:41,299
I really liked that answer.

1610
01:05:42,259 --> 01:05:44,669
A Korean can't possibly be as tall as you.

1611
01:05:44,670 --> 01:05:46,399
It's a miracle as an Asian.

1612
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:49,040
You trim your own eyebrows, right?

1613
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:50,968
(Male Number 26 bursts into laughter.)

1614
01:05:50,969 --> 01:05:53,540
Talking with Female Number Nine...

1615
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:56,540
left a better impression compared to the first.

1616
01:05:57,080 --> 01:06:01,020
I don't think I'll have a change of heart with her.

1617
01:06:06,819 --> 01:06:09,519
There was this petite and pretty person.

1618
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,029
She kept grabbing my attention.

1619
01:06:11,529 --> 01:06:13,758
Yes, she's the one. Number 19.

1620
01:06:13,759 --> 01:06:15,999
The model. Hye Won.

1621
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,569
Was it Hye Won?

1622
01:06:17,799 --> 01:06:19,669
It was like seeing a celebrity.

1623
01:06:19,670 --> 01:06:22,169
When I first saw her, I was like, "What?"

1624
01:06:22,170 --> 01:06:24,770
"Why is she here? Why are we in the same area?"

1625
01:06:27,170 --> 01:06:31,309
Hi. I'm Yoo Hye Won, born in 1995.

1626
01:06:31,310 --> 01:06:33,480
"Wait. What a pretty girl!"

1627
01:06:35,179 --> 01:06:37,850
(Revealing her story for the first time)

1628
01:06:38,589 --> 01:06:42,359
My mom, younger sister, and me.

1629
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:44,830
My family consists of three members.

1630
01:06:45,029 --> 01:06:47,189
As I don't have a dad,

1631
01:06:47,190 --> 01:06:51,028
I'm the typical K-eldest daughter trying to fulfill...

1632
01:06:51,029 --> 01:06:52,799
the role of a dad.

1633
01:06:53,929 --> 01:06:56,670
When I was little, I was the type...

1634
01:06:57,739 --> 01:07:01,839
who needed to eat what I craved.

1635
01:07:02,679 --> 01:07:05,949
But not being able to eat it the next day if I had it today...

1636
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:08,080
made me sad.

1637
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:11,089
That's one of the reasons...

1638
01:07:11,719 --> 01:07:14,089
I'm working hard right now.

1639
01:07:15,389 --> 01:07:17,929
(Why is she on COUPLE PALACE?)

1640
01:07:19,989 --> 01:07:21,429
A bad guy.

1641
01:07:23,859 --> 01:07:27,429
And a guy who was really popular.

1642
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:29,369
Those two.

1643
01:07:29,370 --> 01:07:30,469
(Those were my exes.)

1644
01:07:31,069 --> 01:07:32,509
I want to have...

1645
01:07:34,609 --> 01:07:36,540
a normal relationship like others.

1646
01:07:38,750 --> 01:07:41,079
Number 19. You didn't ask any questions, did you?

1647
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:42,080
No.

1648
01:07:42,081 --> 01:07:43,850
- Nor picked anyone? - No.

1649
01:07:44,049 --> 01:07:45,290
- I knew it. - I see.

1650
01:07:45,350 --> 01:07:46,590
The type who hates to get hurt.

1651
01:07:46,719 --> 01:07:48,599
(During Round 1, Female Number 19 was passive.)

1652
01:07:48,719 --> 01:07:50,158
Number 19 didn't vote for anyone.

1653
01:07:50,159 --> 01:07:51,888
You didn't like any of them, did you?

1654
01:07:51,889 --> 01:07:52,960
That's not true.

1655
01:07:55,259 --> 01:07:59,199
Everyone was amazing and cool.

1656
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:03,270
But I'm a cautious person.

1657
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:05,608
Having to vote...

1658
01:08:05,609 --> 01:08:08,080
was quite a task for me.

1659
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:12,779
(Her cautious personality made everything difficult.)

1660
01:08:12,949 --> 01:08:14,189
I don't want to meet a bad guy.

1661
01:08:14,679 --> 01:08:17,449
I don't want to meet a popular guy either.

1662
01:08:18,189 --> 01:08:21,719
One of my life goals is to meet a good person...

1663
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:26,159
and get married to him.

1664
01:08:30,699 --> 01:08:33,069
- Goodness. - She's really pretty.

1665
01:08:33,229 --> 01:08:35,099
- What a pretty person. - Gosh.

1666
01:08:35,239 --> 01:08:36,599
Here's Number 19.

1667
01:08:39,769 --> 01:08:41,908
- Goodness. - My gosh.

1668
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:44,239
Oh, my. She's really pretty.

1669
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:46,609
- She was really pretty. - How pretty.

1670
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:52,550
I never once stopped working.

1671
01:08:53,050 --> 01:08:56,889
I believe I'll become a very supportive partner...

1672
01:08:56,890 --> 01:08:59,130
to my future husband.

1673
01:09:01,229 --> 01:09:03,629
You're in the first place.

1674
01:09:03,630 --> 01:09:06,000
(Female Number 19 got 8 votes in an instant.)

1675
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:10,470
But isn't there a rumor about her?

1676
01:09:11,069 --> 01:09:13,140
- Right? - Yes.

1677
01:09:13,569 --> 01:09:14,609
The ex-girlfriend.

1678
01:09:14,809 --> 01:09:17,308
I see. So she's that person.

1679
01:09:17,309 --> 01:09:18,649
I've heard of her name.

1680
01:09:20,109 --> 01:09:21,880
- Number 19. - Number 19.

1681
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,489
Really?

1682
01:09:24,942 --> 01:09:28,753
I couldn't look them in the eye.

1683
01:09:29,590 --> 01:09:30,620
I got...

1684
01:09:31,890 --> 01:09:32,930
I got...

1685
01:09:33,729 --> 01:09:35,729
too into it.

1686
01:09:39,229 --> 01:09:40,330
What do I do?

1687
01:09:42,269 --> 01:09:44,609
(The male's speed train Round 1 continues.)

1688
01:09:45,069 --> 01:09:46,069
(He's a looker.)

1689
01:09:46,170 --> 01:09:48,779
(Despite being a doctor, everyone was good-looking.)

1690
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,680
(Many females vote for the popular males.)

1691
01:09:51,149 --> 01:09:52,448
(The condition for marriage is becoming more demanding.)

1692
01:09:52,449 --> 01:09:53,449
(Looking for a wife to work in Australia together)

1693
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:54,795
(Hoping to give my mother a monthly 2,000-dollar allowance)

1694
01:09:54,819 --> 01:09:55,819
(Don't show affection!)

1695
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:57,180
(Why would you date him?)

1696
01:09:57,181 --> 01:09:58,188
(Why date in the first place?)

1697
01:09:58,189 --> 01:09:59,189
(That hurts.)

1698
01:09:59,890 --> 01:10:02,859
(A special chance, a new rule in Season 2, remains?)

1699
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:04,220
(Excited)

1700
01:10:04,221 --> 01:10:05,858
(Isn't it a privilege that wasn't in Season 1?)

1701
01:10:05,859 --> 01:10:06,859
(They're holding hands?)

1702
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:08,528
(I'm sorry. I'm giving up.)

1703
01:10:08,529 --> 01:10:09,559
(Shocked)

1704
01:10:10,059 --> 01:10:13,929
(The female's speed train Round 2 begins!)

1705
01:10:13,930 --> 01:10:15,410
(All kinds of women are on the show.)

1706
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:17,340
(Men can't hold back pork cutlet.)

1707
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:20,509
(A banquet of beautiful women who strike the men's hearts)

1708
01:10:20,510 --> 01:10:22,478
(All men would like her.)

1709
01:10:22,479 --> 01:10:24,449
(Everyone is gorgeous.)

1710
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:26,608
(The men keeps voting nonstop.)

1711
01:10:26,609 --> 01:10:29,749
(A familiar face with a drastic change has come?)

1712
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:30,948
(I was gaping at her beauty.)

1713
01:10:30,949 --> 01:10:32,018
(In a daze)

1714
01:10:32,019 --> 01:10:33,518
(Her annual salary is 100,000 dollars.)

1715
01:10:33,519 --> 01:10:34,789
(Her annual salary is 300,000 dollars.)

1716
01:10:34,790 --> 01:10:35,790
(500,000 dollars?)

1717
01:10:35,791 --> 01:10:37,271
(They all have a high annual salary.)

1718
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:42,698
(Her fragility made me want to protect her.)

1719
01:10:42,699 --> 01:10:43,930
(She's beautiful.)

1720
01:10:44,330 --> 01:10:48,370
(Female Number 19's first pick is finally revealed.)

1721
01:10:48,970 --> 01:10:50,039
(The participant leaves with tears.)

1722
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:51,309
(I feel really wronged.)

1723
01:10:51,409 --> 01:10:52,909
(The people were annoying.)

1724
01:10:54,109 --> 01:10:57,709
(It seemed like none of the men were interested in me.)

1725
01:10:57,710 --> 01:10:59,180
(And I mean everyone.)

1726
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:02,080
(It was depressing and heartbreaking.)

1727
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:03,479
I wanted to go home.
