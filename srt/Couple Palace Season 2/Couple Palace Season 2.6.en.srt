1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,880
(COUPLE PALACE 2)

2
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,090
(Palace Week is toward marriage!)

3
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,619
(The couple zone where a couple prepares marriage)

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,589
(The single zone where you meet various people)

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,589
(When they were hesitating between two zones)

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,199
(New residents who will change the game appear.)

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,899
(Ha Soo Jin, Yoo Hye Won)

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,469
(Hwang Jae Keun)

9
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,700
(A popular man appears, and a lot of women cast votes.)

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,239
(Jae Keun meets Hye Won again.)

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,040
(What will happen between the two of them?)

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,409
(Jae Yeon and Joo Hee)

13
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,449
(However)

14
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,850
(Everything he says is funny.)

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,949
(A new man appears and parts them.)

16
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,020
(They get along well.)

17
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,990
(What will happen to the four of them?)

18
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,690
(On the other hand)

19
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,406
(Ji Woong has been called to the single zone from couple zone.)

20
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,759
(Who invited him?)

21
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,829
(A match who meets Sin Da's conditions as a partner)

22
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,259
(A house that's two million dollars worth)

23
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,829
(I have a debt.)

24
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,329
(Jung Won is Sin Da's match.)

25
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,410
(Ji Woong is qualified to meet Sin Da's conditions.)

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,510
(Why did you come here? I'm talking to him.)

27
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,910
(Where will his heart go?)

28
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,209
Palace Week that stimulates you to no end.

29
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,149
- I couldn't sleep last night... - Yeah?

30
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,849
Because I couldn't wait to find out.

31
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,789
People have asked me if Jae Yeon is being real.

32
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,989
That's right.

33
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,459
It's hard to be that straightforward.

34
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,559
- Seriously. - Right?

35
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,859
Many people are rooting for Jae Yeon.

36
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,136
(Straightforward Jae Yeon who only has eyes for Joo Hee)

37
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,759
I got scared when...

38
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,800
Sin Da was looking for Ji Woong.

39
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,530
(The most unforgettable scene)

40
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,399
When she was pushing her away through,

41
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,469
I was very surprised.

42
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,939
She searched for him as if he was a criminal.

43
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,010
"Where is he?"

44
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,339
Will Ji Woong break away from the couple zone to be single?

45
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,980
Or will he stay? I can't wait to find out.

46
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,979
By now,

47
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,809
there are couples that we get hopeful about.

48
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,249
Yes, there are many.

49
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,279
I hope that Jae Keun and Hye Won...

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,620
will have a proper conversation together.

51
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,119
They joined Palace Week as the surprise participants.

52
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,989
And he got to meet Hye Won again.

53
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,029
Right.

54
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,660
I can't wait to find out what happens.

55
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,930
It's the first afternoon at the single zone.

56
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,500
Let's start the marriage-focused date.

57
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,770
Male Number Three, Jae Keun.

58
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,879
Please go to your place.

59
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,139
(Jae Keun goes on his marriage-focused date.)

60
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,849
Jae Keun got to go on a marriage-focused date.

61
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,179
I wonder who his date will be.

62
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,620
(Who is Jae Keun's date?)

63
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,490
I saw Number 19 up close.

64
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,790
There are bad rumors about her.

65
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,489
Goodness.

66
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,529
There was...

67
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,360
some gossip about her.

68
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,829
Since this is about marriage,

69
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,329
- it could be a concern. - Right.

70
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,840
- It'd be okay if it's just dating. - Right.

71
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,240
It could bother him a little.

72
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:51,109
(Jae Keun has many thoughts on his mind.)

73
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,509
(His marriage-focused date is...)

74
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,950
(Female Number 19, Yoo Hye Won.)

75
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,280
There was a scandal about her with someone famous.

76
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,749
(Hye Won smiles brightly when she sees Jae Keun.)

77
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,850
Hello.

78
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,019
What will happen?

79
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,090
To me,

80
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,590
that wasn't that important.

81
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,729
(Hye Won's past isn't important to Jae Keun.)

82
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,259
- Gosh, he's amazing. - That's amazing.

83
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,830
Did you see the look on his face?

84
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,199
"To me, it isn't that important."

85
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,070
He's so amazing.

86
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,669
- Over here. - Hello.

87
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,470
- Hello. - Hello.

88
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,640
It's good to see you.

89
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,380
We get to talk again.

90
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,449
I'm so relieved.

91
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,280
(They got to meet again.)

92
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,690
You can fill this out.

93
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,119
(Jae Keun notices something.)

94
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,150
What is it?

95
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,989
You're quite unusual.

96
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,790
- Aren't you uncomfortable? - No.

97
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,530
Okay.

98
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,829
Then I'll sit like this too.

99
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,199
Shall we sit down?

100
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,229
- Shall we? - Otherwise, it's uncomfortable.

101
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,430
Let's just sit here.

102
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,100
This is interesting.

103
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,210
Instead of sitting on the sofa, she sat on the floor.

104
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,539
I also sat on the floor. Do you see this?

105
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,209
Do you see fur that got on me?

106
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,479
It's so messy at the bottom.

107
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,280
My pants are covered with fur.

108
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,520
I like sitting in the corner.

109
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,620
He found it very unusual.

110
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,320
Most people sit on a sofa.

111
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,860
Really? I see.

112
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,160
Where do you live?

113
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,099
Currently, I'm living in Tokyo.

114
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,059
- Tokyo? - Yes, in Shinagawa.

115
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,099
Shinagawa.

116
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,130
There's a beautiful river in the neighborhood.

117
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,769
I'm completely okay with where he lives.

118
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:28,670
Depending on my partner's work,

119
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,810
I can even move to an island.

120
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,210
It doesn't matter to me.

121
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,650
She seems very open-minded.

122
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,149
Japan is an island, after all.

123
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,719
- Yes, it's a big island. - It's a big island.

124
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,919
It's a huge island.

125
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,649
- Hawaii is also an island. - Jong Kook is such a Thinking Type.

126
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,819
- It drives me crazy. - What's wrong?

127
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,289
When she said that she can move to an island,

128
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,989
- she didn't exactly mean an island. - Right.

129
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,629
Don't we say the same thing about a fling?

130
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,630
(Don't we say the same thing about a fling?)

131
00:04:50,631 --> 00:04:52,399
It's so hard to talk to the guys.

132
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,400
Let's move on.

133
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,499
- "Gawa" means river. - Gawa.

134
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,839
So I live near a river.

135
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,370
I see. I like...

136
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,079
I learned this a moment ago. It's something I like.

137
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,110
What do you like?

138
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,380
That...

139
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,549
Tsuke? Tsuki?

140
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:14,449
- The moon. - "Tsuki" means the moon.

141
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,920
I find the Japanese word for moon very pretty.

142
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,889
There's something different about Hye Won.

143
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,789
It's hard to predict her.

144
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,299
When I anticipate an answer,

145
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,729
her response is completely different.

146
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,470
She's very different from me,

147
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,670
but I can't say that I hate it.

148
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,300
Number of visits to parents.

149
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:34,909
- I don't know. Let's skip this. - Okay.

150
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,279
Distribution of housework. This is negotiable.

151
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,339
Negotiable?

152
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,750
Is this a speed quiz?

153
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,750
Are you taking a speed quiz?

154
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,049
- Hye Won, you're fascinating. - Why?

155
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,250
You're like...

156
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:52,959
a human being I've never met before.

157
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,989
(A human being I've never met before)

158
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,030
Why?

159
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,830
I don't know. You're very creative.

160
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:02,029
People have told me that I'm unique.

161
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,670
It's not something bad.

162
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,470
You're very mysterious.

163
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,510
Am I that unusual?

164
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,410
It seemed like he felt uneasy with me.

165
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,249
I'm less feminine...

166
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,456
- than you expected, right? - You're different from your looks.

167
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,519
- Exactly. - Right?

168
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,619
You aren't sassy like a girl...

169
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,390
- from Seoul. - Right?

170
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,859
- Many people judge me... - Who are you?

171
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,520
(Who are you?)

172
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,059
- Hey. - Oh, my.

173
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,860
- What's going on? - What is he doing?

174
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,530
What was that about?

175
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,869
He's acting cute like a large dog.

176
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,269
It's adorable when a large dog acts cute.

177
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,600
It's so adorable.

178
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,669
- Many people judge me... - Who are you?

179
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,470
- based on my appearance. - Yes?

180
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,150
Quite a lot of people are surprised...

181
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,610
- by my unexpected personality. - Right.

182
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,250
- It's interesting. - You're very popular.

183
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:54,950
Why is that?

184
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,390
Are they curious about me?

185
00:06:57,391 --> 00:06:59,920
Because of your looks. You look kind.

186
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,160
You have the look that women prefer.

187
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,060
- Really? - Yes.

188
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:07,330
Is that what you think too?

189
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,429
He wants to hear it from Hye Won.

190
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,540
Let's go to the island.

191
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,970
Do I have the look that you prefer?

192
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,369
- Yes. - I see.

193
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,780
- Thank you. - Okay, thank you.

194
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,040
Thank you.

195
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,650
I have no idea. What do I do?

196
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,550
Who on earth is she?

197
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,389
Despite that, I keep gravitating toward her.

198
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,720
I don't know.

199
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,890
I don't want to be rejected twice. Seriously.

200
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,289
I want stability in my life.

201
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,330
That's what I think. This is marriage.

202
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,730
This is marriage, right?

203
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,870
Stability is important in marriage.

204
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,639
On COUPLE PALACE 2,

205
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,039
he's the hottest man.

206
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,569
In my opinion, it's Number Three.

207
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,980
Why don't we give them two chances?

208
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:54,350
We should give him a chance with her.

209
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,879
In terms of manners and attitude,

210
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,449
- they're very similar. - Right.

211
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:02,049
I'm curious about the chemistry between them.

212
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,930
(Will Jae Keun find a stable marriage partner?)

213
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,360
- Who is it? - Who is it?

214
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,930
(His second marriage-focused date)

215
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,300
Hello.

216
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,829
She's the one who doesn't like thin lips.

217
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,100
- It's Jin Ju. Right. - Jin Ju.

218
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,270
I was also curious about Number 23.

219
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:23,110
I talked to her for the first time during the speed date.

220
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,079
(Jin Ju's flirting without hesitation)

221
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,250
I can move to Japan.

222
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,450
Our meeting was short but impactful.

223
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,350
I was surprised to see her as my marriage-focused date.

224
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,219
I'm so happy that you came.

225
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,090
- Thank you. Me too. - Yes.

226
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:42,089
Jae Keun's second marriage-focused date is...

227
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,629
- Jin Ju. - Right.

228
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,859
Jin Ju had been interested in Jae Keun.

229
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,729
- Right. - I can't wait to find out...

230
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,870
the chemistry between them.

231
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,200
I'm curious about your age.

232
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,770
I was born in 1990.

233
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,810
- I was born in 1991. - I see.

234
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,540
Are you an ENFP?

235
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,510
- Am I wrong? - You're right.

236
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,110
Am I right?

237
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,619
My guess was right. That's amazing.

238
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,649
To be honest, you seem quite similar to me.

239
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,750
I agree. I'm an ESFP.

240
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,060
An ESFP?

241
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,420
That's fascinating.

242
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,060
I got into weightlifting recently.

243
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,599
My hobby is working out,

244
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,129
- and so... - I see.

245
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,970
- Gosh, they would get along. - They would.

246
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,640
The wedding.

247
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,039
I'd like the wedding to be...

248
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,609
- like a party. - Me too.

249
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:33,179
I want a raffle...

250
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,309
- where people can win prizes. - Right.

251
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,149
I don't want a common wedding.

252
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,749
I know what you mean.

253
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,719
I don't want it to be too luxurious either.

254
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,890
Right. This is great.

255
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,189
We were very similar.

256
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,590
We had a lot in common in our way of thinking.

257
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,100
(Filling out the profile continues.)

258
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,860
How much money do you have?

259
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,000
I have about 250,000 dollars.

260
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,199
Could I ask for financial advice?

261
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,840
Financial advice? Of course.

262
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,269
This might sound irresponsible,

263
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:03,640
but I'd like my wife to take care of it.

264
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,710
- My bank account. - That's better.

265
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,150
I'd like my wife to do it.

266
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,950
Your wife could prefer that.

267
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,519
It'd depend on the personality.

268
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,580
Right.

269
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,489
I'll manage your assets.

270
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,619
(Bank teller for VIP clients with interpersonal skills)

271
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,420
Wouldn't this couple be perfect?

272
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,919
- They're perfect. - Yes.

273
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,920
They're the same...

274
00:10:19,921 --> 00:10:21,160
- in every way. - Exactly.

275
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,690
She seemed stable.

276
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,229
It felt like wearing a shirt...

277
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:28,030
that's buttoned up perfectly.

278
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,500
I went on a date with Jin Ju and Hye Won.

279
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,200
They're very different from each other.

280
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,940
They're the complete opposite.

281
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,109
When Jae Keun is with Hye Won,

282
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,779
he looks like a college student...

283
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,309
- having fun at a group date. - Right.

284
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,310
That's the feeling I get.

285
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,480
With Jin Ju, it's like he's meeting a prospective marriage partner.

286
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,279
He becomes quite serious.

287
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,189
In terms of marriage,

288
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,160
Jin Ju could be a stable partner.

289
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,590
This is the second day of Palace Week.

290
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,860
They must have thought a lot overnight.

291
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,099
(Ringing)

292
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,300
What's the bell for?

293
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,369
Is it something to control one's mind?

294
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,639
Oh, I was right.

295
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,470
(Ringing)

296
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,940
Where should I go to have fun today?

297
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,621
If I get invited to the single zone again today, I'll go.

298
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:18,320
There's someone I'd like to talk to more.

299
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,680
Did you have fun?

300
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,100
It was much more fun than the couple zone.

301
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:23,789
(Last night at the single zone party)

302
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,666
(Ji Woong went to the single zone party after getting invited.)

303
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:26,690
Come downstairs.

304
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,689
Things are very uncertain for Ji Woong.

305
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:29,830
Definitely.

306
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,200
Sin Da's dress was...

307
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:36,870
practically falling off.

308
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,770
I didn't know where to look.

309
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,940
- What? - I didn't know where to look.

310
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,670
Female Number Nine with the blonde hair.

311
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:45,309
She asked me to rank the women...

312
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,739
and whom I'm attracted to the most.

313
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,350
The one I'm most attracted to...

314
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,450
If I go all the way with that one...

315
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,790
when I don't really like her...

316
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,889
(Everyone is shocked.)

317
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,160
What is he saying?

318
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:02,060
Who are you calling "that one"?

319
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,029
- You seem quite angry. - I am.

320
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,529
- Gosh. - I'm so flustered.

321
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:08,270
- You seem quite angry. - I'll ring the singing bowl.

322
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:11,399
You need to be strategic.

323
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,239
I should go on secret dates.

324
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,709
Yes, seriously.

325
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,810
It's a secret anyway.

326
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,209
Ha Yeon has no idea about this.

327
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,680
Right. I feel bad for her.

328
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,256
(Men in the couple zone wait for their partner at breakfast.)

329
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,380
(Hyun Joong is deep in thought.)

330
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,510
(Last night, Si Yeon was invited to the single zone party.)

331
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,760
(After sending Si Yeon off to the single zone)

332
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,860
There must be a lot on his mind.

333
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,300
It was unsettling.

334
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,129
(There's a lot on his mind.)

335
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,670
He must be conflicted.

336
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,739
(The women arrive for breakfast.)

337
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,210
- Hello. - Hello.

338
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,479
Isn't this Hyun Joong and Si Yeon's first meeting...

339
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,139
since last night's single zone party?

340
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,180
That's right.

341
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,780
What will they talk about?

342
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,640
(Si Yeon says hello to him first.)

343
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,680
Hello.

344
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,680
(Hyun Joong only nods to say hello.)

345
00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:01,950
(He doesn't look at Si Yeon.)

346
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,820
Shall we?

347
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:05,590
What's this?

348
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,660
He wasn't looking at me.

349
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,990
- Enjoy your food. - Enjoy your food.

350
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,530
(The meal starts in silence awkwardly.)

351
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,899
There was something different about him today.

352
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,140
I heard that you had a lot of fun yesterday.

353
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,740
Me?

354
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,870
No, I meant everyone.

355
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,540
I didn't.

356
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:25,910
(Glancing)

357
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,409
The air is heavy.

358
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,410
(Si Yeon is worried about Hyun Joong who's quiet.)

359
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:31,820
(Ji Woong stares at Si Yeon.)

360
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,020
Why are you looking at me?

361
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,820
Last night, in the single zone, Si Yeon...

362
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,159
Her fancy... Never mind.

363
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,160
Fancy?

364
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,870
I didn't hear that right, did I?

365
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:46,300
Ji Woong... Never mind.

366
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,400
(Uncomfortable)

367
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,370
No, I stayed quiet.

368
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,630
I might get an upset stomach.

369
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,840
Yesterday...

370
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,980
- As soon as I got there... - Did you talk to people?

371
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,950
Yes, I bragged a lot yesterday.

372
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,990
- Brag? - I bragged about you.

373
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,320
- Really? - Yes.

374
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,859
(Si Yeon made a comment to please him.)

375
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,690
- He's finally smiling. - That's right.

376
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,160
- It's curing my hangover. - What?

377
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,170
It's curing my hangover. I drank all night alone.

378
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,339
Si Yeon looks so much better now.

379
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,599
Me? It's because Number Four is with me.

380
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,340
- I see. - Gosh.

381
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,940
Finally.

382
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,380
I felt relieved.

383
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,179
Thank you for the food.

384
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,486
(Their harmonious breakfast is over.)

385
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,879
(A car is heading somewhere.)

386
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,760
- Where are they going? - Where are they going?

387
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,590
(Sighing)

388
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,519
(Where are Hyun Joong and Si Yeon going?)

389
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,560
Are you sighing?

390
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,160
I feel so nervous.

391
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,889
I should have brought something for the nerves.

392
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:49,890
Right.

393
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,600
What kind of date will ours be?

394
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,270
(The pre-wedding meeting)

395
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,939
Is the date set?

396
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,940
It's tomorrow at 1pm.

397
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,910
(She'll be meeting Hyun Joong's parents.)

398
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,109
(Hyun Joong and Si Yeon's schedule today)

399
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,010
- Gosh, pre-wedding meeting? - Already?

400
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,049
Si Yeon and Hyun Joong are having a pre-wedding meeting today.

401
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:12,549
A pre-wedding meeting is a must before the wedding.

402
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,190
- Right, it's a must. - Yes, it's a must.

403
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,220
My parents are easygoing.

404
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,690
My parents are easygoing for me too.

405
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,499
(Will their pre-wedding meeting go smoothly?)

406
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,499
- My gosh. - It looks delicious.

407
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,170
- This is great. - We have food.

408
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,170
Is this what I think it is?

409
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,400
Each person...

410
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,740
As we're sitting down waiting, men will arrive.

411
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,940
Are there more men or more women?

412
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,240
There's one more woman.

413
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,209
There's one more woman.

414
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,450
- Really? - Yes.

415
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,920
So this is it.

416
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,550
Do we sit on the red chair?

417
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,219
Since women entered first,

418
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,949
it must be men who get to choose.

419
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,960
I think so.

420
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,889
It's not a big deal, but I feel so nervous.

421
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:58,060
I was worried about eating alone.

422
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,800
I usually eat alone fine.

423
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:05,069
I could even go to a barbecue place by myself.

424
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:09,110
But I didn't want to eat alone on COUPLE PALACE.

425
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,809
- This is it. - Where is it?

426
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,050
(Single zone men are entering.)

427
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,609
It snowed a lot.

428
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:16,649
I knew it.

429
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,120
The women are sitting down.

430
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,489
Oh, no. They're coming.

431
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,149
One of them will have to eat alone.

432
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,120
- I know. - I'd get an upset stomach.

433
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,260
They're here.

434
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,529
The men are coming in...

435
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,850
- for the breakfast date. - Gosh.

436
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,900
Hi.

437
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,599
Smile, everyone. It's good to see you.

438
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,839
(It's awkward, but they're glad to see them again.)

439
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,940
(Hello)

440
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,069
(Jung Won is the first to get his food.)

441
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,970
I have no appetite.

442
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,679
Will he pick Sin Da?

443
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,950
(The moment of choice)

444
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,820
It was a nerve-racking moment.

445
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,249
(He has to eat breakfast...)

446
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,820
(with the woman he's interested in.)

447
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:58,890
What?

448
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,419
(Jung Won's choice is an empty seat?)

449
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,759
- Is he going? - What?

450
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,190
- What? - What's wrong?

451
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,206
(He's not picking the empty seat.)

452
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,929
- He was only joking. - Was it a joke?

453
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,429
(He heads to...)

454
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,769
(Female Number 21, Oh Seung Yeon?)

455
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,200
(It's not her either.)

456
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,239
It made me angry. He has to sit in front of me.

457
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,780
Whom else would he sit with?

458
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,510
(Whom will he choose?)

459
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,480
(Jung Won ends up sitting in front of Sin Da.)

460
00:17:22,481 --> 00:17:24,920
- Oh, come on. - He was teasing.

461
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,950
I failed to keep a poker face.

462
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,990
- That was expected. - He chose the expected seat.

463
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,560
This is for you.

464
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,689
Oh, my.

465
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:38,699
Okay.

466
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,176
(Jung Won's small present for Sin Da)

467
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,599
Suddenly from his pocket,

468
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,240
he shyly gave me some vitamins and tablets to reduce swelling.

469
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,769
It made me feel better right away.

470
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:51,210
Thank you. Oh, my.

471
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,910
That's so sweet.

472
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,910
He seems cold, but he's actually caring.

473
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,320
Enjoy your food.

474
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,850
What's this? I don't know what to do.

475
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:06,720
- Mr. Popular. - Why did I stand in the front?

476
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,990
The situation this morning...

477
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,930
It was a total crisis.

478
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:18,170
They were all seated close to one another.

479
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,070
- Oh, no. - My gosh.

480
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,170
Hye Won, Seo Hee, and Jin Ju.

481
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,539
All three of them are watching.

482
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:28,210
- Like the Bermuda Triangle. - Gosh, that's a tough call.

483
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,109
- He had a lot on his mind at night. - Right.

484
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,180
Will it be Jin Ju or Hye Won?

485
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,356
"Even if it doesn't work out, just go for it."

486
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,420
"Go."

487
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:38,189
Will it be Hye Won or me?

488
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,460
I was wondering where he'd sit.

489
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,689
Whom will he pick?

490
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:44,499
(Whom will Jae Keun choose?)

491
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,730
- Hello. - Is it Hye Won?

492
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,300
His arm moved this way.

493
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,900
Hello.

494
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,900
Hello.

495
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,039
Hello.

496
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,239
(Jae Keun chose Jin Ju.)

497
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,609
- What? - My gosh.

498
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:58,010
Jae Keun chose Jin Ju in the end.

499
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:02,030
The marriage-focused date with her must've left a strong impression.

500
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,720
I was really surprised.

501
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,920
The dynamics will get complicated now.

502
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,649
He made a bold move.

503
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,420
Yes. He made a bold move.

504
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,190
What is this feeling of unpleasantness?

505
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,960
It didn't feel good.

506
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,480
You look handsome even in the morning.

507
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,269
- I tried to look intelligent. - Yes.

508
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,310
- You do have that vibe. - You think so? Thank you.

509
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,539
You look lovely...

510
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,140
- and beautiful as always. - Is that so?

511
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,180
You don't even look puffy in the morning.

512
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,080
To make things worse, Hye Won is sitting behind Jin Ju.

513
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,049
So she can see them and hear their conversation...

514
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,389
- if she pays attention. - She can.

515
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,630
(She can't help but notice them because she's so close.)

516
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,760
I wanted to eat comfortably.

517
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,760
Comfortably.

518
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,360
I feel comfortable when I'm with Jin Ju.

519
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:59,069
(Meanwhile, Joo Hee is waiting for her breakfast date.)

520
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,199
Who will it be?

521
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,310
I was very curious about my breakfast date.

522
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:04,870
Will it be Male Number Seven?

523
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,340
Or Male Number 24?

524
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,350
I knew he would come to me.

525
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,620
- Hello. - Hello.

526
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,149
- The snowmen are gone. - It's Jae Yeon.

527
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,549
- He only has eyes for her. - He moved fast.

528
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,230
They must've melted since it's warm today.

529
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,490
He came to me just as expected.

530
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,790
I was happy to see him.

531
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,620
(At that moment, Sang Gyeong is still waiting to get his food.)

532
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,229
(He spots them rather late.)

533
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,040
Sang Gyeong and Jin Ju were matched before.

534
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:36,609
My gosh. I'm in a pickle.

535
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,740
(I'm in a pickle.)

536
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:41,370
I was waiting in line for my food.

537
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,580
Jae Keun chose Jin Ju, and they were having breakfast.

538
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,550
I was sort of shocked at that moment.

539
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,390
"Where should I sit?"

540
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,290
This popular guy has nowhere to go.

541
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:55,659
Jin Ju and Joo Hee were the ones he interacted with.

542
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,260
But both of them are already taken.

543
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:01,470
(At that moment, someone grabs his eyes.)

544
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:03,599
- You're here. - Yes.

545
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,540
I thought I would have to eat alone. What a relief.

546
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,609
- Yes. - Thanks to you,

547
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:10,310
- I won't have to eat alone. - Yes.

548
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,540
Thank you.

549
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:12,941
(Ha Soo Jin, his date from Round 3)

550
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,779
What did you guys talk about?

551
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,509
- What? - "Are things going well?"

552
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,310
- "Who are you interested in?" - Right. We...

553
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,680
talked about our concerns.

554
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,420
And people in the couple zone said,

555
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,890
"The single zone is much better."

556
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,960
No. Si Yeon from the couple zone said...

557
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:30,029
the single zone was like being in the jungle.

558
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,599
She said it was utterly uncomfortable.

559
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,959
(The single zone is a jungle to someone from the couple zone?)

560
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,070
If you want to remain here longer, you can.

561
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,470
- But what if... - Yes.

562
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:39,710
I tell you I want to get to know someone else more?

563
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,740
If you want to get to know someone else?

564
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,180
It's possible to develop an interest.

565
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:52,220
I don't seem to understand my feelings either.

566
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,250
Why not?

567
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,589
Things could have been different in the couple zone.

568
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,989
But they're in the single zone.

569
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:00,519
She's allowed to talk to other guys.

570
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,990
(What will happen to them?)

571
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,929
(Hye Won is still alone.)

572
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,930
Oh, no. Hye Won is still alone.

573
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,130
Enjoy.

574
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,200
Jae Keun went to Jin Ju.

575
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:18,240
It felt like I was an outsider.

576
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,879
(At that moment...)

577
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,450
- Do you want to eat together? - Yes.

578
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:23,980
Thank you.

579
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,820
Enjoy.

580
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,390
- Enjoy your food. - It's Yoon Seo.

581
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,690
(Hye Won's breakfast date is Yoon Seo.)

582
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:34,589
(Meanwhile, Jung Won and Sin Da are having breakfast.)

583
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,730
By the way,

584
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,160
you disappeared yesterday all of a sudden.

585
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,560
What?

586
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,400
You disappeared.

587
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,330
When?

588
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,170
Toward the end.

589
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,310
Actually, I kind of felt guilty.

590
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:54,809
(Ji Woong and Sin Da talked in private at the party last night.)

591
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:57,580
So I... What was it?

592
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:02,089
(They spent quite a long time...)

593
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:06,290
(as they had a heart-to-heart chat.)

594
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,429
- He doesn't know where she went. - Right, but we know.

595
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,660
- We know. - Yes.

596
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,599
(Meanwhile, the last guy has taken his seat.)

597
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,930
I did have some expectations.

598
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,299
- Oh, no. - Na Kyung.

599
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,540
She looks so upset.

600
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,710
Because I'm gorgeous and competed in a beauty pageant,

601
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:25,440
am I difficult to approach?

602
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,039
"Is my beauty too intimidating?"

603
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,326
- Is that what she meant? - I see.

604
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,449
I love people with high self-esteem.

605
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,450
That's right.

606
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,219
Did you sleep well?

607
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,526
- Would you like to sit down? - Sure.

608
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,720
I want to go out and run in the snow.

609
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,370
I'm in a good mood because it snowed.

610
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,359
Who were you going to pick for your breakfast date?

611
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,389
(You, of course.)

612
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:47,229
Right. That's why when you were getting your food,

613
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,670
- I looked at you. - Right. I saw you too.

614
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,740
But Jae Keun picked pretty early on.

615
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,500
I didn't know what to do.

616
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,269
Should we go upstairs?

617
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,270
- Now? - Yes.

618
00:23:56,271 --> 00:23:57,810
- Sure. - Okay.

619
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,450
She went with Sang Gyeong in the end.

620
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:09,149
The thing is that I like being around people...

621
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:11,520
- and hanging out as a group. - Yes.

622
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,689
But I also enjoy spending some quiet time like this.

623
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:15,690
Hold on.

624
00:24:15,691 --> 00:24:17,460
- Like this. - Hold on. Here...

625
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,659
- Is that lint? - Wait.

626
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,740
- What was that? - My gosh.

627
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,550
- What was that? - It's all over the place.

628
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,569
I don't think you should be with me.

629
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:27,570
Why not?

630
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,510
This place was covered in lint yesterday.

631
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,339
- It wasn't from me yesterday. - Right?

632
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,056
- I don't know where... - It was from Sin Da.

633
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,749
- But I'm the culprit today. - Yeah?

634
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,849
So...

635
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:42,020
(She's worried that the lint might get on his clothes.)

636
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,589
- But... - Yes.

637
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,519
I don't mind if you are the culprit.

638
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,520
- Really? - Yes.

639
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,830
Maybe, you have to use the lint roller.

640
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,829
I should carry one in my pocket.

641
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:53,900
"I'm sorry. Hold on. Let me pass through."

642
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,730
I think we're the most compatible.

643
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,740
With her, it feels as if...

644
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:03,310
we're really dating. I can talk to her comfortably now.

645
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,649
- Did you enjoy breakfast? - Yes.

646
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:09,709
- I see. - I...

647
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:10,909
- Yes. - What was that?

648
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:13,249
I didn't mind if I had to eat alone.

649
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,320
I had a feeling that you wouldn't mind.

650
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,989
- Actually, I... - I was like,

651
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:20,360
"There's nothing I can do." That's what I thought.

652
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,350
I didn't know we could use the second floor.

653
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,459
(The four of them meet while heading over for a chat.)

654
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,729
My gosh, why did they have to meet?

655
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,129
- Oh, my. - Goodness.

656
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:27,159
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

657
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,599
- They ate together, - I think we can use that room.

658
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,229
- but they're with different people. - Well...

659
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,840
It's so uncomfortable.

660
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,209
I wanted to talk to you, Hye Won.

661
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,310
- Really? - Yes.

662
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:39,709
As for breakfast,

663
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:42,709
I wanted to talk to Jin Ju too.

664
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:43,950
While talking to Jin Ju,

665
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,820
I saw this shade of bright pink behind her.

666
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:51,220
It was glowing, so I couldn't look ahead.

667
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,459
You were in my line of sight.

668
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,660
(He kept glancing at Hye Won.)

669
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,660
- Well, I'm human too. - Yes.

670
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,099
I thought, "Why won't he eat with me today?"

671
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,570
- It's natural to think so. - Right. Of course.

672
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,909
I thought, "I guess he wasn't that interested."

673
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:11,139
So I was just having my meal.

674
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,710
Actually,

675
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,309
I had another marriage-focused date with Jin Ju yesterday.

676
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,380
I see.

677
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:20,780
Oh, no. That must bother her a lot.

678
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:25,659
As for Jin Ju, to put it simply, we have a similar personality.

679
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,660
I see.

680
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,360
She likes to hang out with other people...

681
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,700
- in a big group. - I see.

682
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,970
But as for you, you always...

683
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,730
surprise me.

684
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,939
Yes.

685
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,709
I know who you resemble with the glasses.

686
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,840
Who do I resemble?

687
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,009
You resemble Im Si Wan.

688
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:48,240
Did I say that before?

689
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:51,080
Im Si Wan? Wasn't he in "MISAENG?"

690
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,150
- Yes, he was. - Really?

691
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,560
I'm glad I put on glasses today.

692
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:58,390
I'm just saying whatever's coming to my mind, huh?

693
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,030
- That was random. So this is... - That wasn't my point.

694
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:05,330
When he said that,

695
00:27:05,331 --> 00:27:07,499
I couldn't exactly say, "I'm not that different."

696
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,569
"Please take a look at me again."

697
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:11,070
It felt weird to say that.

698
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,040
I didn't know what to say, so I...

699
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,080
You really are fascinating.

700
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,479
No one's ever told me that.

701
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,180
I'm fascinated by you.

702
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:28,049
Perhaps, I have a stereotype of beautiful women.

703
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:30,020
No. It's not that.

704
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,810
- You have to get to know me... - Yes.

705
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,560
- That's true. - in a short period of time.

706
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:37,030
- So it's not gradual. - Right.

707
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:40,430
- If I were being myself, - Yes.

708
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,569
I would've left...

709
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,999
- without saying a word. - Right.

710
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,940
But if I did,

711
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,470
I could have regretted it.

712
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,409
So that's why.

713
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:53,610
(Jae Keun gets a glimpse at Hye Won's feelings.)

714
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:56,709
Hye Won has never expressed her interest...

715
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,479
- toward Jae Keun before. - Right.

716
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,049
It was only circumstantial and implied with feelings.

717
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,050
Right.

718
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,819
Jae Keun wants to ask Hye Won...

719
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,720
- what she thinks about him. - I see.

720
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,719
But they can't seem to have this conversation.

721
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,119
So they keep going in circles.

722
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,230
I see.

723
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:16,100
(Joo Hee comes out to the communal lounge.)

724
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,099
(Sang Gyeong glances at Joo Hee.)

725
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,170
What's going on?

726
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,809
Look at their eyes. They're exchanging glances.

727
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:25,809
- Yes. He's giving her a signal. - He's giving her a signal.

728
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:27,009
(Jae Yeon, Sang Gyeong, Joo Hee)

729
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,656
(The three of their gazes are tangled up.)

730
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,280
- Right. - Joo Hee, can we talk for a bit?

731
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,650
What?

732
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,549
(The man who asked Joo Hee for a chat is...)

733
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:36,019
(Young Taek.)

734
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,450
Young Taek had his eyes on her too?

735
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,889
Gosh, Joo Hee is so popular.

736
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:42,329
Jae Yeon, Young Taek, and Sang Gyeong.

737
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,729
(Sang Gyeong saw the whole thing.)

738
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:46,729
- I see. They left together? - Really?

739
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:48,500
- They left. - Gosh.

740
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,199
Oh, no.

741
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,720
(Jae Yeon who feels sad moves around.)

742
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,546
It's so hard not to smoke after seeing what I just saw.

743
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,780
Why did you quit smoking?

744
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,239
She doesn't like smokers.

745
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,610
(Joo Hee doesn't like smokers.)

746
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:05,480
- If people can see us, - Right. It'd be...

747
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,920
- it'd be embarrassing. - A bit.

748
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,750
I thought that I would quit smoking...

749
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:12,220
when I was interested in dating someone.

750
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,430
I thought I found the one.

751
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,060
Gosh, you love her for real.

752
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:25,370
(But like a trick of fate, he can only watch them leave.)

753
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,439
He quit smoking for her.

754
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,340
But he'll have to smoke because of her.

755
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,779
- Gosh, how heartbreaking. - Oh, no. This is so sad.

756
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,279
- They sound like song lyrics. - Right.

757
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,556
(It's a heartbreaking situation like a song lyrics.)

758
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,649
To be honest, I wanted to talk to you.

759
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,050
- Really? - Yes.

760
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,349
- Let me tell you why. - Yes.

761
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:44,220
- We went on that speed date. - Yes, we did.

762
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:46,219
(You have a great voice.)

763
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:49,060
(The 2 of them talked for the 1st time in Round 3.)

764
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,960
(It was quite romantic as they exchanged compliments.)

765
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:55,000
- I had fun talking to you that day. - Same here.

766
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,970
Right. They did have a date in Round Three.

767
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,570
They hit it off.

768
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:02,139
Afterward, I wanted to talk to you...

769
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,810
- a bit more. - Yes.

770
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:08,650
But someone was guarding you pretty closely.

771
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:12,750
(It was yesterday in the communal lounge.)

772
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,319
(At the end of his gaze, )

773
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,419
(there were Joo Hee and Jae Yeon.)

774
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,089
I see. He was next to her the whole time.

775
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:20,289
He had his eyes on her the whole time too.

776
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:23,130
Right. He kept staying close to her.

777
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,260
My gosh.

778
00:30:24,261 --> 00:30:25,599
(Next to Joo Hee, )

779
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,030
(was always Jae Yeon.)

780
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,669
I thought to myself that I should talk to her...

781
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,169
- Yes. - whatever happened.

782
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:35,100
- Okay. - With that in mind,

783
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:38,170
- I asked you. - Thank you so much.

784
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,279
I didn't know this would happen. Why are you so attractive...

785
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,250
I mean, I didn't see it coming.

786
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:44,850
- Okay. - You're funny.

787
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,089
(Meanwhile, Jae Yeon is waiting for her in the lounge.)

788
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:51,020
Female Number 18 is so popular.

789
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,720
Yes. She's so popular.

790
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:56,829
- I'll just wait for her quietly. - You'll do what you can?

791
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:57,950
(I'll wait for her quietly.)

792
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:00,500
I'll just guard our path.

793
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:04,470
You're such a cool guy.

794
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,969
- I bet you have a lot on your mind. - Yes.

795
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,450
I have more stuff to think about now.

796
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,580
Let me add to the pile.

797
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:16,750
- I didn't see this coming at all. - Add one more guy to the list.

798
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:19,550
Did you do your makeup and hair?

799
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,349
- Yes, but I kept it simple. - You're so good at that.

800
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,589
- You think I did a good job? - Yes.

801
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,059
- Really? - You're good at styling your hair.

802
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,060
- My hair? - Yes.

803
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:29,659
You might think I'm flirting.

804
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,790
But I'm serious.

805
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,559
(She's careful to bring it up.)

806
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,000
- You can tell me. No pressure. - Objectively speaking,

807
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:38,030
I dig your style.

808
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:42,170
- When I saw your outfit today... - Thank you.

809
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,869
This is the kind of style I like.

810
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:44,910
- Really? - Yes.

811
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,440
That's good then. It's good.

812
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,609
- My gosh, this is crazy. - Oh, my.

813
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:50,749
- Thank you. - Young Taek is...

814
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:54,280
Joo Hee's type in terms of appearance.

815
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:59,489
Our dear pharmacist is having fun talking to Young Taek.

816
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,159
- You should join them. - Yes.

817
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,230
I'm not sure. I'll talk to her later.

818
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,359
- No, go to her now. - Talk to her now.

819
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,059
- Talk to her now. - Go and steal her.

820
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,529
- Steal her. - Go. You can do that.

821
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:10,129
- An hour is too long. - Go there.

822
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:11,529
- You don't have to wait. - An hour is too long.

823
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,770
- "I'll steal her away." - I'll go and get her.

824
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:15,509
- Thank you for your advice. - Let's go.

825
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,639
- Yes. - You're so cool.

826
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,640
You should've done that before.

827
00:32:17,641 --> 00:32:19,121
- That was too long. - There he goes.

828
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,440
(Meanwhile, they're having a great time.)

829
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,909
My gosh, Jae Yeon is on the move.

830
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:25,650
Will he try to steal back Joo Hee?

831
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,650
- There. - Can I stay with you guys?

832
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,120
Okay.

833
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:32,859
You're talking to her for too long.

834
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,089
- It's getting hot. - I'm here to keep you in check.

835
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,330
Really?

836
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:36,789
It's really hot in here.

837
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:37,889
- Can I open the window? - Here?

838
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,759
Are you feeling hot? What were you guys talking about...

839
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,459
- that she feels hot? - We were wrapping it up.

840
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,699
- I see. Is that so? - Yes, we were wrapping up.

841
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,299
- What did you talk about? - Work.

842
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,100
- We talked about work. - Work. I see. Is that so?

843
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,769
- You know, - You...

844
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:51,469
it feels like getting caught while having an affair.

845
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,509
Me?

846
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,980
(It feels like getting caught while having an affair.)

847
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:56,880
It feels like I'm here...

848
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,279
To catch your wife in an affair?

849
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,879
It feels like I'm here to catch my girlfriend in an affair.

850
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,049
- But... - Yes.

851
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:03,419
You're not a couple yet.

852
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,119
- So we were just talking. - He said, "You're not a couple."

853
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,559
Gosh, Young Taek is putting up a fight too.

854
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,060
- "You're not a couple yet." - Well, he's not wrong.

855
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,329
You're not a couple yet.

856
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:14,230
(Young Taek won't back down anymore.)

857
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:17,870
- We did talk a lot. - That's all.

858
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,539
We were done with our talk.

859
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,240
- Right. It was over. - We were done.

860
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,670
That's not important.

861
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:25,186
- It's so uncomfortable. - I'll join you too.

862
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:27,439
- My gosh. - Everyone, come. That's better.

863
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,409
- That'd be better. - Everyone should join us.

864
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:30,909
- Right. - We're here to watch them.

865
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:32,009
- Who won? - Why is everyone coming here?

866
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,170
- Is the audience coming in? - The audience is coming?

867
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,949
I was taught to watch fun shows in the front row.

868
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,489
- But the show is over. - Right?

869
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:38,590
- It's over. - It is?

870
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,389
Then Female Number 18...

871
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:42,360
- Yes? - Joo Hee, can we talk for a bit?

872
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,430
- How about a talk? - Yes.

873
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,599
- Let's talk. - Yes.

874
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,359
- We talked a lot. We're done. - Yes.

875
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,000
We had a pleasant talk.

876
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,740
Things are naturally getting interesting.

877
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,570
This is hard. I'm doomed now.

878
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,940
Joo Hee is so popular.

879
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:01,279
- She must be in a tight spot. - She must feel uncomfortable.

880
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,979
- She must feel uncomfortable too. - Right. Yes.

881
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,110
She must be happy and torn at the same time.

882
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,420
We had to wait for a week...

883
00:34:07,421 --> 00:34:09,190
- before coming here. - Yes.

884
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,420
- During that week, - Yes.

885
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:14,159
- I was thinking about you. - Yes.

886
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,829
I was positive about marriage.

887
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:19,399
I decided to focus only on you...

888
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,999
- and then came here. - Yes.

889
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,199
Then I had a talk with Male Number 24.

890
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,200
Yes.

891
00:34:24,201 --> 00:34:27,299
And he was extremely funny when we talked.

892
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,300
Right?

893
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:31,010
Then I became curious about him.

894
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:32,910
So...

895
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:36,950
I didn't know what to do. I kept thinking about this.

896
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:41,450
Out of the blue, Young Taek came to talk to me.

897
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,289
So...

898
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:47,220
- You have a lot on your mind. - Yes.

899
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,059
But as for Male Number 24, even if I were interested in him,

900
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,960
he might not choose me. That's possible too.

901
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,930
That's not important.

902
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:59,440
That's not what's important.

903
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,570
- Right. - Yes.

904
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,340
That's not important.

905
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,570
Personally,

906
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:07,540
- I'm attracted to someone like me. - Yes.

907
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,010
Someone who thinks like,

908
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:14,280
"I'm compatible with him. He's the one."

909
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,050
I want someone who feels that way about me.

910
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,559
I want to marry...

911
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,030
the next guy I date.

912
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,499
It's harder for me to decide.

913
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,259
Let's say I'm just looking to date.

914
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:31,630
Then I can just date anyone. It doesn't matter that much.

915
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,200
But now that marriage is in the picture,

916
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,670
- I'm being careful. - So...

917
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,080
- When I get to know someone, - Yes.

918
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:47,150
I don't fall for her head over heels after one date.

919
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,279
- Really? - Yes.

920
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,620
But I think I will only end up...

921
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,720
liking you more.

922
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:00,929
(Jae Yeon's sudden confession)

923
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:01,999
- Okay? - Yes.

924
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,100
But I can confidently promise you this.

925
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,769
I know I can take better care of you...

926
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:09,069
than anyone who shows interest in you.

927
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:11,230
I can confidently say I'll be better than any of them.

928
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:14,840
- Seriously, Jae Yeon. - My gosh. Oh, my.

929
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:16,609
He only had eyes for me.

930
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:20,350
So I saw how serious he was. That built trust.

931
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:24,790
I thought, "A guy like this is trustworthy."

932
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:28,819
(Jae Yeon's faithfulness earned her trust.)

933
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,330
He made sure she knew how he felt.

934
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,729
Right. Jae Yeon keeps...

935
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:33,499
- earning her trust. - That's right.

936
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,200
It is true that he likes Joo Hee a lot.

937
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:41,369
Gosh, she must be nervous to meet his parents.

938
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:43,239
Si Yeon must be so nervous.

939
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,720
(Hyun Joong's parents arrived first and are waiting for them.)

940
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:47,010
(Hyun Joong's mother, Hyun Joong's father)

941
00:36:47,011 --> 00:36:48,110
Come on in.

942
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,909
- My gosh. - Hey.

943
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:52,519
- Come on in. - Okay.

944
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,749
- Hello. - It's been a while.

945
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:54,919
- Oh, my! - Nice to meet you.

946
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,819
(Hyun Joong's father greets them warmly.)

947
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,920
You don't need to get up.

948
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:01,919
(She meets Hyun Joong's parents for the first time at last.)

949
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,359
Hello.

950
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,059
- Hello. Please sit down. - Okay.

951
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:10,830
(Si Yeon feels awkward about everything as she's nervous.)

952
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,670
- My gosh. - Yes.

953
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,539
He resembles you a lot.

954
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:18,169
Both of you are so good-looking.

955
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,240
- My gosh. - Oh, my.

956
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,439
- Hyun Joong resembles them a lot. - Nice to meet you.

957
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,679
- He does. - Yes.

958
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,910
It's nice to meet you.

959
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:24,679
When I first met him,

960
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,919
I couldn't look him in the eye because he was so handsome.

961
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,119
My goodness.

962
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,690
You guys are so good-looking too.

963
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,819
I'm so nervous.

964
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,759
- You're quite eloquent. - No.

965
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,760
Thank you.

966
00:37:34,761 --> 00:37:35,836
(Feeling proud for some reason)

967
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,889
My gosh. I've never met any of his girlfriends.

968
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:40,659
I had never introduced anyone to my parents.

969
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:43,569
He had never brought a girl home.

970
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:44,700
This is new to me too.

971
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:46,670
You're not dating yet.

972
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,139
This is our first time meeting.

973
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:53,040
- I've never met anyone's parents. - My gosh.

974
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:54,740
- Really? - This...

975
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,349
- It will be Christmas soon. - My gosh. I completely...

976
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:59,580
- forgot about that. - It's chocolate. Please open it.

977
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,080
Thank you. We didn't prepare anything.

978
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,790
- It's okay. - I see.

979
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,920
When did she prepare this?

980
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,789
I thought I might end up meeting his parents...

981
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,429
because...

982
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:17,370
He wanted his future wife to learn his mother's secret recipe,

983
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:20,470
so I assumed that I'd at least meet his mother.

984
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,610
I thought I might as well do it properly,

985
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,509
so I prepared those.

986
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,950
(She kindly thought of his parents.)

987
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:31,909
She's so considerate and sensible.

988
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,179
She remembered.

989
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,350
(Admiring)

990
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,019
- How gorgeous! - Ta-da!

991
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,720
- Goodness. - This is so cute.

992
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,480
I can't eat this, it's too pretty.

993
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,160
Chocolate doesn't rot, so...

994
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,159
- I should put it in a frame. - Yes.

995
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,729
And put it on the wall.

996
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:47,730
Thank you for this.

997
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:49,670
She even got a present for me.

998
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:51,400
She got me pajamas.

999
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:53,669
(When they entered the couple zone)

1000
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:54,670
- Seriously? - Yes.

1001
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:59,080
(Si Yeon gave him pajamas as a gift.)

1002
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:01,040
You should give her something back.

1003
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,410
- I received a gift from him first. - Oh, did you?

1004
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,979
I actually...

1005
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,080
- burned my hand, - Oh, no.

1006
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,149
And he gave me a burn ointment.

1007
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,449
- He's sweet. - He's always been meticulous.

1008
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:12,659
- Yes, I was really... - He's thoughtful.

1009
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,559
- touched by that. - Right.

1010
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,620
He takes after his father.

1011
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:18,090
Sure.

1012
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,400
You two were on the same page about that.

1013
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,229
- Help yourself, my dear. - Oh, thank you.

1014
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,929
-Oh, my. - Help yourself, my dear.

1015
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:27,039
"My dear?" He called her that?

1016
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,170
- He's accepted her. - Goodness.

1017
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,210
He's pretty humorous.

1018
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,580
- It was a surprise, wasn't it? - Yes.

1019
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,280
I wish you would express things like your father.

1020
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,119
Thankfully, she prepared so much.

1021
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,220
I was so surprised.

1022
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:44,890
I reckoned that I should treat her better.

1023
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:49,060
Shall we begin now?

1024
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,560
In Article 1, Clause 2 of the Pre-Marriage Meeting Act,

1025
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:54,829
it states that one must ask about their family relations first.

1026
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:56,269
(Ask about their family relations first.)

1027
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,770
To introduce ourselves, it's just the three of us.

1028
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,600
Yes.

1029
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,740
One son, a mother, and a father.

1030
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:04,490
We live separately at the moment.

1031
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:07,679
I have a father, a mother, me,

1032
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,880
and a younger brother. I'm the eldest daughter.

1033
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,920
Article 1, Clause 3 of the Pre-Marriage Meeting Act.

1034
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,680
- Yes. - May I ask what your job is?

1035
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:19,260
I run a fashion brand.

1036
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,640
There's brightness in your eyes.

1037
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:22,389
Really? Thank you.

1038
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:24,260
- I hope we can be friends. - Goodness.

1039
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,860
- Clause Four. - Yes.

1040
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:29,300
- Let's say you two end up... - Yes.

1041
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,070
Getting married in the future.

1042
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,739
- What are your thoughts on kids? - Yes.

1043
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:36,970
Well, I love kids,

1044
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:40,840
so I wish to have one as soon as we're married.

1045
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,710
- As soon as possible. - As soon as possible?

1046
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:47,750
I hope to have three children, but...

1047
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,920
There's a special clause in the Pre-Marriage Meeting Act.

1048
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,559
With an asterisk?

1049
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,200
- Yes. I'll tell you what it is. - I see.

1050
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:57,930
How do you see this relationship going...

1051
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:00,860
in terms of feelings, going forward?

1052
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,529
(What's her answer to her future plans with Hyun Joong?)

1053
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:04,000
This is crucial.

1054
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:10,409
I never imagined that I'd meet a man like him...

1055
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:11,870
while I was here.

1056
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:15,309
I'm fascinated and dazed, to be honest.

1057
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:17,950
- And meeting his parents... - You never found the one.

1058
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:20,220
- That's right. - That's all good, then.

1059
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:24,020
To summarize, you wish to have three children as soon as possible.

1060
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:25,550
Well...

1061
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,459
- That's his summary? - Am I wrong?

1062
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,859
That's how he summarized it.

1063
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,129
That's what she said, isn't it?

1064
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:32,490
(Hyun Joong's father lightens the mood with a joke.)

1065
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,100
Let me go and exercise.

1066
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:36,900
It's going to be tough.

1067
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:39,030
Oh, my goodness.

1068
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:41,470
This pre-wedding meeting is going great.

1069
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:44,469
- She's nice. - I'll do my best.

1070
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:47,070
(The gathering is quite friendly, thanks to Hyun Joong's father.)

1071
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,310
The pre-wedding meeting must have been a lot of pressure on her.

1072
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,520
But I loved how sociable she was.

1073
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,480
I thought, "Is this what happiness is?"

1074
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:58,390
- Get home safely. - Okay.

1075
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:01,059
I had so much fun today. Thank you for having me.

1076
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,140
(The happy gathering ends.)

1077
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,630
You have such nice parents.

1078
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,100
- Do you think so? - Yes.

1079
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:10,270
You're a nice person,

1080
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,470
so... I'll do better.

1081
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,540
Oh, my gosh!

1082
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:17,969
- I love this atmosphere. - "I'll do better."

1083
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:20,140
The meeting ended in a success.

1084
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,980
When you see a woman getting along with your parents,

1085
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:26,280
it builds credibility.

1086
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:28,520
Is your bottom warm?

1087
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:30,490
- Yes, it's warm. - Good.

1088
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:33,490
Do you want me to turn the heater on and put my jacket around you?

1089
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,889
(Hyun Joong is far more enthusiastic after the meeting.)

1090
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:37,960
- Goodness. - I like that. Take it off.

1091
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:42,870
So, you weren't saying no.

1092
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,570
I think I can do better now.

1093
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:47,500
Yeah?

1094
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:51,210
I must do better.

1095
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:56,849
- Oh, my gosh. - Oh, my.

1096
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:59,180
I think he wants to hold her hand.

1097
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,620
So, what do you think? Now that it's over...

1098
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,260
I'm tired.

1099
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,489
- Are you tired? - Yes.

1100
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:08,959
(His feelings for her have grown.)

1101
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,790
- This is nice. - It's so lovely.

1102
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,460
You did well.

1103
00:43:12,461 --> 00:43:14,130
(They returned to the couple zone.)

1104
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:17,230
Are you giving me a piggyback ride?

1105
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:19,800
Get on my back, my dear.

1106
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
"My dear."

1107
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,539
- I'm going to. - Oh, my gosh!

1108
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,540
I really am.

1109
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,910
That's so cute!

1110
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:27,710
What did you say?

1111
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:31,350
(He carries her on his back to thank her for her hard work.)

1112
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:32,750
I'll open it with my foot.

1113
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,719
- What? - I'll get it.

1114
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,289
(They feel more intimate after the gathering.)

1115
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:37,290
I'm tired.

1116
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:38,490
Good work today.

1117
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:46,459
(Si Yeon's room)

1118
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,429
- I was so sad. - Why?

1119
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:50,170
- I went to the pre-wedding meeting. - Yes.

1120
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:53,700
And I thought that it would have truly been...

1121
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:59,640
a blessing if they were even a tiny bit friendly.

1122
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:02,910
What did you like about our son?

1123
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:07,349
At first, he was a bit much...

1124
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:08,619
because he was too handsome.

1125
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,589
How did you know? I also felt burdened...

1126
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:12,230
- when I first met my husband. - Come on.

1127
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:13,790
I bet.

1128
00:44:13,791 --> 00:44:15,089
So, I said I wouldn't marry him,

1129
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:17,290
but he kept chasing me.

1130
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:18,960
Do we have the same dynamics?

1131
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,730
- Is my future... - You're so beautiful, ma'am.

1132
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:24,369
I don't like it when a guy is too handsome.

1133
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:25,599
Neither do I!

1134
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,100
- It's too much pressure. - Exactly.

1135
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:30,940
I never imagined that they'd be that friendly,

1136
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,309
but it felt just like I was with my family.

1137
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:35,030
(She could sense how harmonious they were.)

1138
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:38,209
I was so thankful.

1139
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:39,690
(The date couldn't have gone better.)

1140
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:42,380
His mother was speaking...

1141
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:46,760
and said, "Our kids."

1142
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:49,629
- He's always been a good boy... - Yes.

1143
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:50,630
Since he was a baby.

1144
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:52,760
Our kids are kind.

1145
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,359
(She said, "Our kids.")

1146
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,530
I was like, "Our kids?"

1147
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:57,969
"Why is it plural when he's an only son?"

1148
00:44:57,970 --> 00:44:59,840
That's what came to my mind.

1149
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:03,470
And her face darkened all of a sudden.

1150
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:07,739
I didn't know what was happening.

1151
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:08,910
(What's going on?)

1152
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,579
(She seems to have something to tell Si Yeon.)

1153
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:13,380
Hyun Joong is... Is it okay to talk about this now?

1154
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,489
I'd like to hear it.

1155
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:18,119
(The mood turned heavy in a second.)

1156
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,190
About what? Oh, don't say it.

1157
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:24,229
(Hyun Joong isn't speaking either.)

1158
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:25,460
What is it?

1159
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:29,800
It's just that we have a sad family story.

1160
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:33,370
I think she was going to tell you that story.

1161
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,800
He had an older sister.

1162
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:40,909
But her heart was weak when she was 12,

1163
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:41,910
so she passed away first.

1164
00:45:41,911 --> 00:45:43,810
- She was born with it. - Yes.

1165
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:46,420
She was adorable.

1166
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:49,020
That's why I said, "Our kids," earlier.

1167
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,120
Yes.

1168
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,090
She was so bright...

1169
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:57,090
that the universe decided to take her away first.

1170
00:45:57,330 --> 00:45:58,360
And Hyun Joong is...

1171
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:05,070
- They say when your child is ill, - Yes.

1172
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:08,239
Your next child is born gentle.

1173
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,870
That way, the parents can rest.

1174
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:11,410
It's just an old saying.

1175
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:16,449
A boy like him was born into our family,

1176
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:18,979
and he never caused any trouble.

1177
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:22,480
He grew up to be such a gentleman, so I'm grateful for that.

1178
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:24,720
We're grateful.

1179
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,219
You're not eating anything.

1180
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:30,559
- Yes, eat up. - Eat up.

1181
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,560
You said you'd eat.

1182
00:46:31,561 --> 00:46:32,689
- Eat up, my dear. - Don't just sit there.

1183
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:34,060
I am eating.

1184
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:41,099
It feels like Hyun Joong is doing the job of two children.

1185
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:45,210
And I think his sister is looking after him from above.

1186
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:52,310
To imagine that happening to my younger brother...

1187
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:55,680
You know, you can relate.

1188
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,090
But it was a pre-wedding meeting.

1189
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:03,090
If I were to empathize with them, even by a little bit,

1190
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,530
I thought I might sob.

1191
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:09,830
(She deliberated what to say and chose to suppress it.)

1192
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:14,040
Even he was holding himself back. Who am I to...

1193
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:17,940
Even his mother told me about it so calmly.

1194
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:20,680
It's not an easy topic to bring up.

1195
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:24,380
The way she opened up so much to tell me that story...

1196
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,080
felt so nice.

1197
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:30,289
Then, we came back.

1198
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:31,649
(She took a glance at Hyun Joong's profile card.)

1199
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:32,750
I looked at his card,

1200
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,060
and it said, "Be my mother's daughter."

1201
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:36,689
As I was reading that...

1202
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:37,890
("Be my mother's daughter.")

1203
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:41,999
(He wanted his future spouse...)

1204
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,730
(to make up for what he couldn't provide.)

1205
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,970
(She didn't know the true meaning at the time.)

1206
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,539
You're right.

1207
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:52,470
Yes. And...

1208
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:56,210
when I read that,

1209
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:58,210
I could picture him...

1210
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,079
holding his emotions back again.

1211
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,989
(She remembered how he was holding back his tears.)

1212
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:08,589
if I were to cry at that moment

1213
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:10,160
when she's telling me this so calmly...

1214
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,790
Hold on. What's wrong with me?

1215
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:16,770
(She has a lot of emotions thinking about Hyun Joong.)

1216
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:19,100
So...

1217
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:22,510
I didn't think it was the right moment to cry.

1218
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:24,810
I tried...

1219
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:28,440
my best not to cry.

1220
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:36,820
(Single zone)

1221
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:38,490
He really...

1222
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:42,360
cared for you.

1223
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:43,760
You're right.

1224
00:48:43,761 --> 00:48:45,636
He really is cold on the outside and warm on the inside.

1225
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:48,700
My heart is wavering.

1226
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,070
Like this?

1227
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:53,199
I used to think that he was cold-hearted,

1228
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,139
but I began to realize that he was also warm-hearted.

1229
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:57,469
INTP types tend to...

1230
00:48:57,470 --> 00:49:00,580
follow the one person...

1231
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:05,209
that broke into their shell...

1232
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:06,619
- like ducklings. - Right.

1233
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:07,649
- Really? - He's a duckling now!

1234
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:08,770
They trust you indefinitely.

1235
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:10,219
Yes, they do.

1236
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:11,990
- I think he's kind of like that. - Yes.

1237
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:15,219
That's why he's been following you the whole time yesterday.

1238
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:17,330
That's his way of saying, "Pay attention to me."

1239
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,760
An INTP type like him is already into you.

1240
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:22,430
I'm pretty touched.

1241
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:24,030
Is he your ultimate choice now?

1242
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:25,800
- Pretty much. - Yes.

1243
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,840
I think Sin Da also fell for Jung Won...

1244
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:31,570
after the breakfast date.

1245
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:37,080
(5 seconds before Sin Da meets her favorite)

1246
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:39,510
You look really fancy again.

1247
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:41,719
You're so fancy.

1248
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,450
You two make a cute couple.

1249
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:46,990
(They're unofficially single zone's best-looking couple.)

1250
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:49,989
It seems like Sin Da is also opening up to him.

1251
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:51,060
You're so weird.

1252
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,199
The men call Jung Won...

1253
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,400
Sin Da's bodyguard.

1254
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,730
There's a rumor that he's your bodyguard.

1255
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:02,940
Jung Won started to look cute.

1256
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:05,469
I heard that it was game over once they start looking cute.

1257
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:06,639
It's totally over.

1258
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,910
It's over once they look cute.

1259
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,210
- Should we go somewhere else? - I'd love to.

1260
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:14,980
(Sin Da and Jung Won came upstairs.)

1261
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,250
Oh, my gosh.

1262
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:19,150
- Great. - She's holding onto his arm.

1263
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,219
(Where they can be by themselves)

1264
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:24,160
This room is nice. I see myself.

1265
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:26,699
I knew this room would be your favorite.

1266
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:27,700
Really?

1267
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:29,930
You're lost in that mirror.

1268
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:32,400
(She checks her looks and sits.)

1269
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:35,140
Do you think there will be a selection today?

1270
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:37,710
In fact,

1271
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:41,710
it's also fun to get to know one like this.

1272
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:46,680
But...

1273
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:48,950
- What? - "But?"

1274
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:51,319
(Jung Won seems to have something to tell her.)

1275
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,390
Say it!

1276
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,360
Why are you sighing?

1277
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:58,490
I wasn't sighing.

1278
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:02,700
I don't know what to do.

1279
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:05,130
I can't decide, to be honest.

1280
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,840
What can't you decide?

1281
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:13,409
You can't decide on what you're feeling?

1282
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:14,480
Or...

1283
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:19,179
- What? - What's with this sudden mood?

1284
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:20,500
- What's happening? - What is it?

1285
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:23,190
What is it? Tell us!

1286
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:24,820
I'm not sure about my feelings.

1287
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:30,290
- What? Why? - Why? That's so random.

1288
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,660
You're joking, right? Don't tell me you're serious.

1289
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:37,900
They said you were her bodyguard.

1290
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:40,440
To be precise,

1291
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,870
there are still a lot of women I haven't talked to yet.

1292
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:48,340
Look at Sin Da's face.

1293
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,210
It's like...

1294
00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:54,280
He must have someone he wants to get to know more.

1295
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:57,220
I'll...

1296
00:51:57,890 --> 00:51:59,090
try to make up my mind soon.

1297
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:02,260
I felt extremely offended.

1298
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,960
He brought that up after all this time,

1299
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:08,700
and I was annoyed, like, "What's with this guy?"

1300
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,270
Then, I got curious. Of all the women here...

1301
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,000
They're having a snowball fight.

1302
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:19,539
(There's a snowball fight in the single zone.)

1303
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:21,480
That's so funny.

1304
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,949
- Awesome. - Attack!

1305
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:26,049
She's rolling it.

1306
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:27,619
Is that a snowball? What is that?

1307
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:30,550
(Jung Won also heads outside.)

1308
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:33,289
Is Jung Won interested...

1309
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:34,489
in one of these women?

1310
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:35,690
He must be.

1311
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:39,530
This is so romantic.

1312
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:42,499
(He naturally picks up some snow.)

1313
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,530
Geez.

1314
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:44,870
He picked up some snow.

1315
00:52:44,871 --> 00:52:46,699
I think he'll throw it at the woman he likes.

1316
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:47,700
Who could it be?

1317
00:52:47,701 --> 00:52:48,969
(Who's the woman Jung Won wants to talk to?)

1318
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:50,010
She's watching!

1319
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:52,509
(10 minutes ago)

1320
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:54,379
Is there someone who's on your mind?

1321
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:57,180
Who you'd like to get to know?

1322
00:52:58,350 --> 00:52:59,810
- Who is it? - Number 21.

1323
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:01,279
- Number 21? - Number 21.

1324
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,750
- I see. - Seung Yeon!

1325
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:04,489
- But she's... - The one who sang the theme song.

1326
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:06,559
Did they have a connection, though? Have they talked before?

1327
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:09,089
But Seung Yeon currently has no idea that Jung Won is...

1328
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:11,490
- interested in her. - Exactly.

1329
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,059
That's the single zone for you.

1330
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:14,830
You can't guarantee anything here.

1331
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:18,570
No!

1332
00:53:18,571 --> 00:53:20,451
(Jung Won pretends to throw one at Seung Yeon.)

1333
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:22,940
(She throws one back.)

1334
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:25,810
Why are you doing this to me?

1335
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:30,050
He suddenly said he was interested in Number 21.

1336
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,180
I didn't quite understand,

1337
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:34,620
and my head was in a jumble.

1338
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:39,449
(The relationship between Jung Won and Seung Yeon begins...)

1339
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:41,819
(with a snowball fight.)

1340
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:44,860
And I saw that as soon as we wrapped up our chat.

1341
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:48,759
Oh, no.

1342
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:49,800
Come on!

1343
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:53,070
No. Wait.

1344
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,910
I felt betrayed.

1345
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,510
- Oh, come on. - Aren't you cold, though?

1346
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:02,679
I'm cold, but this is so much fun.

1347
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:03,780
It certainly is fun.

1348
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:06,649
They act like they're not interested,

1349
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:07,930
but they're watching everything.

1350
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,449
I think she smiles easily.

1351
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:12,850
I like women who smile easily.

1352
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:16,459
I thought it'd be nice to get to know her.

1353
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:18,390
(Jung Won wanted to get to know her.)

1354
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:21,800
- By the way, - Yes.

1355
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:24,699
Everyone says...

1356
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:26,099
- that you're a total introvert. - Me?

1357
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:27,170
Why?

1358
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:31,869
They say that you avoid everyone like you're a herbivore.

1359
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:32,939
- Me? - Yes.

1360
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:34,840
What do I do?

1361
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:36,809
(While they're talking...)

1362
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:37,980
This is unbelievable.

1363
00:54:38,450 --> 00:54:41,219
Oh, my gosh. Is he being nice to her?

1364
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:42,220
He is.

1365
00:54:42,221 --> 00:54:43,989
- Sin Da saw it! - She saw it!

1366
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:45,249
(Sin Da saw everything.)

1367
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:46,859
She had finally opened up.

1368
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:48,320
She must be so upset.

1369
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:50,789
But Jung Won and Seung Yeon also...

1370
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:52,059
- look good together. - Definitely.

1371
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:53,159
- Right? - You're right.

1372
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,360
They make a cute couple.

1373
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:56,199
You can't let your guard down...

1374
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,499
even for a second.

1375
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,100
That's how things go in the single zone.

1376
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,369
(In the meantime...)

1377
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:04,669
(Ha Yeon is waiting for someone outside.)

1378
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:05,840
She must be going somewhere.

1379
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:11,010
(A car arrived in front of her.)

1380
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:13,150
Get in.

1381
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:15,579
Do you know this phrase? "Get in."

1382
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:16,819
You're too young for this, aren't you?

1383
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:17,820
I do know.

1384
00:55:17,821 --> 00:55:19,389
How old was "Get in?"

1385
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:21,630
I thought it was a pickup line for people older than me.

1386
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:23,390
(Where are Ji Woong and Ha Yeon going?)

1387
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,990
I wonder where they're going.

1388
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,260
Is your older brother there?

1389
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,840
- Her older brother? - Her older brother?

1390
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:32,269
I was on the phone with my older brother.

1391
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:33,469
(She was on the phone with him last night.)

1392
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:34,870
To finalize our schedule.

1393
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:36,299
Why...

1394
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,410
Hold on.

1395
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:41,139
(Ji Woong will be meeting her older brother)

1396
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:42,779
He's a journalist.

1397
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,220
(Her older brother is a journalist.)

1398
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:47,420
I never had such good encounters with journalists.

1399
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:50,789
They must be going to meet Ha Yeon's older brother.

1400
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:53,150
(A pre-wedding meeting with her brother who's a journalist)

1401
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:55,759
Ji Woong will have to stay on his toes.

1402
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:56,760
I know, right?

1403
00:55:56,761 --> 00:55:59,081
(Will their pre-wedding meeting end without any problems?)

1404
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:01,600
- Hello. - Hello.

1405
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,820
- It's a pleasure to meet you. - It's a pleasure.

1406
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,810
It's pretty awkward...

1407
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:15,240
to see a family member like this.

1408
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:16,879
I might also be a family member later.

1409
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,710
Oh, already?

1410
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:21,680
Her brother looks pretty charismatic.

1411
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:26,649
May I ask you how old you are?

1412
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:29,219
I was born in 1989. I'm 36.

1413
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:30,489
You're way older than I am.

1414
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:32,760
Oh, no. You're still the senior.

1415
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:35,700
The age gap between you and Ha Yeon is almost ten years.

1416
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,900
She's probably the youngest woman.

1417
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:40,700
Her brother doesn't seem too happy.

1418
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,239
Can I ask you what you do for a living?

1419
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:44,439
- I'm a dentist. - A dentist.

1420
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,509
- So, you have your own clinic. - Yes, I did.

1421
00:56:46,510 --> 00:56:47,879
How long have you been working?

1422
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,809
A little over a year.

1423
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:52,709
As you know, Ha Yeon works in Busan.

1424
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:54,219
How do you plan on solving that?

1425
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:55,749
We're currently...

1426
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:57,920
having a lot of conversations about that matter.

1427
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,689
Ji Woong isn't even breathing properly right now.

1428
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:02,960
He should have made about two jokes by now.

1429
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,289
Come to think of it, he's not making any jokes.

1430
00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:06,660
He can't.

1431
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:09,260
(The tension didn't last long...)

1432
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:10,969
(as the food arrived.)

1433
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:12,269
Eat the shrimp.

1434
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:15,240
(Ha Yeon looks after the tense Ji Woong.)

1435
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:20,040
I have another question.

1436
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,779
- He's not done. - He put his fork down.

1437
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:24,610
He put it back down.

1438
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:26,920
I wish he'd let him eat. One bite, at least.

1439
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:28,980
- I have another question. - Yes.

1440
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:32,220
Aren't doctors usually busy?

1441
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:34,260
Yes, we are busy.

1442
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:36,390
- You need to work on weekends too. - Yes.

1443
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,460
You might have to leave your wife...

1444
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:41,130
at home by herself when you get married later.

1445
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:43,300
I pursue...

1446
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:45,900
my work-life balance.

1447
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:48,870
Though I enjoy working, it's not as much as having fun.

1448
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,640
I enjoy working, but I'm crazy about having fun.

1449
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,469
(Did I hear him right?)

1450
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,339
I'm very concerned about him.

1451
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:56,510
(The tension won't go away.)

1452
00:57:57,410 --> 00:57:58,680
Then,

1453
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:01,279
of all the participants there,

1454
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,720
is Ha Yeon the only one on your mind?

1455
00:58:04,290 --> 00:58:05,850
She's number one at the moment.

1456
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:07,420
And you have numbers 2 and 3?

1457
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:10,190
- That was... - That was sharp.

1458
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:11,690
He's insightful, indeed.

1459
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:16,199
- Numbers 2 and 3 are... - That's what the show is about.

1460
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,769
"Ha Yeon, stay out of this."

1461
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:18,930
"This is between me and him."

1462
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:23,540
(The pre-wedding meeting has become awkward.)

1463
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:28,279
He was questioning me like a journalist investigating.

1464
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:31,009
I was taken aback and scared.

1465
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:32,130
I couldn't help but think...

1466
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:33,619
that he was a bit harsh.

1467
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:35,920
(The two leave after the pre-wedding meeting.)

1468
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:37,449
(Ji Woong looks down.)

1469
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:39,049
Ji Woong always has a mischievous face,

1470
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:40,620
but he looks quite sullen.

1471
00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:45,760
Your brother isn't always such a scary guy, is he?

1472
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:47,060
Did he scare you?

1473
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:50,600
He questioned me like it was an interrogation.

1474
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:56,500
Ji Woong seemed uncomfortable even before the meeting.

1475
00:58:57,770 --> 00:59:00,540
But he did well, so I thought everything was okay.

1476
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:02,810
I wasn't sure what to do.

1477
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:05,279
(The silence continues.)

1478
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,050
Ji Woong won't look at her.

1479
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:14,719
- My gosh. - Why would she do that?

1480
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,590
Somebody stop her.

1481
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:18,589
Hold on.

1482
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:21,399
(Ha Yeon tries to make Ji Woong feel better.)

1483
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,530
- What's that for? - To wake you up.

1484
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:28,370
Is this how you're hitting on me?

1485
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:30,769
(Ji Woong finally smiles.)

1486
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:32,410
I need to stop her.

1487
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:34,140
Let's hold hands.

1488
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:38,210
We might miss this moment.

1489
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:42,519
- Ha Yeon tries to humor him... - Exactly.

1490
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,190
And make him feel better.

1491
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:46,349
(Meanwhile, the single zone)

1492
00:59:46,350 --> 00:59:47,690
We're back to the single zone.

1493
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:50,530
Where's your partner?

1494
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:54,960
- I think she's in there. - In there?

1495
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:56,499
It never popped up since.

1496
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,130
Sin Da is here.

1497
00:59:58,500 --> 00:59:59,570
And there she goes.

1498
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:02,970
Sin Da didn't seem all that happy.

1499
01:00:03,970 --> 01:00:05,170
I knew...

1500
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:06,870
why she would be upset.

1501
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:09,940
- Right. - Of course. He had a blast.

1502
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:12,309
What did...

1503
01:00:12,310 --> 01:00:13,379
(Jung Won approaches Sin Da.)

1504
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:14,950
the ladies talk about during break?

1505
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:16,990
Us?

1506
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:21,559
I'm not that interested in...

1507
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:23,190
who likes who and such.

1508
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:27,230
They'll take care of it themselves.

1509
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:30,159
She's sulking for real.

1510
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,960
(Sin Da is talking less than in the morning.)

1511
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:35,240
I think tomorrow's breakfast will be the same as today's.

1512
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,940
- You can have it with someone else. - Sorry?

1513
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:40,909
Tomorrow's breakfast will likely be like today's.

1514
01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:42,440
You can eat with someone else.

1515
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:44,550
Why?

1516
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:47,180
I think that's only right.

1517
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,120
Didn't you want to do that today?

1518
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,189
I don't want you...

1519
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:56,820
to miss the chance...

1520
01:00:57,890 --> 01:01:00,230
when you're interested in someone else because of me.

1521
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:02,699
(Jung Won and Sin Da are in crisis.)

1522
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,800
They're facing a crisis.

1523
01:01:05,770 --> 01:01:08,139
Tomorrow's breakfast date.

1524
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:10,199
Does that really mean he can eat with someone else?

1525
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,270
Or...

1526
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:12,610
What do you think?

1527
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:16,809
Yes, he can choose someone else. She gave him the okay.

1528
01:01:16,810 --> 01:01:18,650
But if he does, he's dead meat.

1529
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:20,780
(I see...)

1530
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:23,120
(The two are returning to the couple zone.)

1531
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:26,950
She's being very bold now.

1532
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:29,366
- It's cold. - Why is your hand so warm?

1533
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:30,989
My hands and feet are always warm.

1534
01:01:30,990 --> 01:01:32,289
My body is too.

1535
01:01:32,290 --> 01:01:34,799
I'm a heater. A human heater.

1536
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:35,860
Warm me up.

1537
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:38,830
Is the car's heater broken?

1538
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:42,400
Your hand is very sweaty.

1539
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,140
It's the opposite of me. My hands are super dry.

1540
01:01:46,710 --> 01:01:48,150
Join them together and it's perfect.

1541
01:01:48,810 --> 01:01:50,079
The two get along well.

1542
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:52,550
(She's shy but she likes this.)

1543
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:55,380
Do you usually like putting on nail polish?

1544
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:56,580
No.

1545
01:01:57,290 --> 01:01:59,420
You're not the type to dress up daily, huh?

1546
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:03,520
How would you feel if I told you how I want you to dress?

1547
01:02:03,790 --> 01:02:05,860
As long as you don't ask me to wear weird things.

1548
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:09,460
What if I told you to dress like Number Nine?

1549
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:11,200
Out of the blue?

1550
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:14,440
He suddenly mentioned Number Nine Sin Da.

1551
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:16,600
Wearing barely anything?

1552
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,969
Did you see her today?

1553
01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:20,939
- No, I didn't. - She's a total hot girl.

1554
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:22,310
She was also a hot girl yesterday.

1555
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:25,280
- What was she wearing? - It was a dress.

1556
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:27,520
Do you like that style?

1557
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:29,480
Her wearing high heels...

1558
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:32,050
to look taller is really cute.

1559
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:36,460
If you look closely at her face, she's quite cute.

1560
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:39,630
I think she's cute.

1561
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:44,670
Why would you say those things to me?

1562
01:02:45,870 --> 01:02:48,839
Sin Da's the only thing on Ji Woong's mind right now.

1563
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:51,609
- All of his examples are Sin Da. - Exactly.

1564
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:54,380
Why would he bring that up in front of Ha Yeon?

1565
01:02:55,910 --> 01:02:58,909
(The sun has set...)

1566
01:02:58,910 --> 01:03:01,820
(It has finally started.)

1567
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:04,249
The couple zone is having a party.

1568
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:05,290
(Couple zone party)

1569
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,389
The mood is perfect right now.

1570
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:09,690
(The vibe is at its peak.)

1571
01:03:10,630 --> 01:03:12,689
Spending the whole day together...

1572
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:14,930
has brought us closer.

1573
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:18,300
It feels like nature is taking its course.

1574
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:20,500
Nice.

1575
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:21,700
I feel hot.

1576
01:03:22,570 --> 01:03:24,609
- My gosh. - What?

1577
01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:26,109
They feel like an actual couple.

1578
01:03:26,110 --> 01:03:28,610
Ji Woong and Ha Yeon are too close to each other.

1579
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:31,209
(Just then!)

1580
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:32,249
Did someone come?

1581
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:33,679
(The couple zone's door has opened!)

1582
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:34,749
- Why is everyone shocked? - Why?

1583
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:35,750
Why? What's going on?

1584
01:03:38,050 --> 01:03:39,250
What?

1585
01:03:39,450 --> 01:03:40,490
How did this happen?

1586
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,559
What?

1587
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:45,359
(Sin Da and Jung Won have come to the couple zone.)

1588
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:47,030
- What's this? - How did this happen?

1589
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,240
- All of a sudden? - What?

1590
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,170
- Goodness. - Unbelievable.

1591
01:03:51,270 --> 01:03:54,200
- Sin Da. - To think they'd come.

1592
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:55,899
- Welcome. - Oh, wow.

1593
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:57,770
Oh, no. Ji Woong is in trouble.

1594
01:03:58,010 --> 01:03:59,869
Ji Woong had feelings for Sin Da.

1595
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:01,980
(Sin Da has entered the couple zone.)

1596
01:04:02,410 --> 01:04:03,610
I was quite surprised.

1597
01:04:04,850 --> 01:04:06,209
Sin Da kept...

1598
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:09,050
expressing her interest in me.

1599
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:12,390
And come here so fast.

1600
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:14,820
I thought, "What is she thinking?"

1601
01:04:15,790 --> 01:04:19,260
It's like he quit gambling, but a new casino opened.

1602
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:21,960
And right next door at that.

1603
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:24,099
I feel hot.

1604
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:26,030
(The four are sitting next to each other.)

1605
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:27,370
Hi.

1606
01:04:28,670 --> 01:04:29,999
- My roommate. - We're roommates.

1607
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,010
I've heard.

1608
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:35,180
Ha Yeon knows that...

1609
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:37,950
- Ji Woong has feelings for Sin Da. - Exactly.

1610
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:42,180
(Jung Won leaves for a while.)

1611
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:44,919
How was it at the single zone yesterday?

1612
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:45,920
He had fun.

1613
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:49,560
- That's honest of him. - Who called him over?

1614
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:51,760
Three of us called him over.

1615
01:04:51,830 --> 01:04:52,989
- Three? - Yes.

1616
01:04:52,990 --> 01:04:54,699
- I voted, too. - Really?

1617
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:56,860
Yes. He was very popular among the three.

1618
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:59,100
- I... - Our guesses were right.

1619
01:04:59,370 --> 01:05:00,999
- Was I one of them? - Yes.

1620
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,399
I thought that must be why we're roommates.

1621
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,769
I see.

1622
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:06,910
I had the same thought.

1623
01:05:07,410 --> 01:05:08,509
It was right.

1624
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:11,179
(Three people with an awkward atmosphere)

1625
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:12,980
Nowhere in this town is safe.

1626
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,790
It felt like her eyes were fixed on Ji Woong.

1627
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:22,320
"Maybe she might hit on Ji Woong again."

1628
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,530
It has started once again.

1629
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:29,230
(Love deepens in the couple zone)

1630
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:30,260
(What happened to your hand?)

1631
01:05:30,261 --> 01:05:31,269
(Are you that clumsy?)

1632
01:05:31,270 --> 01:05:32,630
(You getting hurt makes me upset.)

1633
01:05:33,170 --> 01:05:34,370
(What are you saying?)

1634
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,799
(He kept asking about Sin Da.)

1635
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:37,809
(Is that so?)

1636
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:39,216
(There must be something between them.)

1637
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:41,279
(I really had no idea.)

1638
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,409
(Single zone where romantic relationships are formed)

1639
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:45,749
(A retriever you want to adopt)

1640
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:47,209
(Adopt me.)

1641
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:48,349
(He's good at singing...)

1642
01:05:48,350 --> 01:05:49,549
(and good-looking.)

1643
01:05:49,550 --> 01:05:52,289
(Getting to know others seems like a good idea.)

1644
01:05:52,290 --> 01:05:54,119
(The catfish starts making her move.)

1645
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:55,159
(How annoying.)

1646
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:56,319
(I'm in danger, right?)

1647
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:57,829
(She's a catfish. A wicked catfish.)

1648
01:05:57,830 --> 01:05:59,229
(I want to get to know more.)

1649
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:00,899
(It's an honor you came as a catfish.)

1650
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:02,899
(He was talking with Soo Jin.)

1651
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:04,199
(Who did you talk with?)

1652
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,469
(Number 24, Sang Gyeong.)

1653
01:06:05,470 --> 01:06:07,069
(I can't stand it!)

1654
01:06:07,070 --> 01:06:08,070
(Can't you fool around?)

1655
01:06:08,071 --> 01:06:09,569
(Check out other people!)

1656
01:06:09,570 --> 01:06:10,909
(I'm going to snatch him away.)

1657
01:06:10,910 --> 01:06:13,169
(Let the voting begin.)

1658
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:14,310
(I might be going home.)

1659
01:06:14,410 --> 01:06:15,579
(So they're leaving?)

1660
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:16,879
(I'm going nuts.)

1661
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,780
(I trust in fate.)

1662
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:20,679
(Don't go.)

1663
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:23,020
(What's happening in the single zone?)
