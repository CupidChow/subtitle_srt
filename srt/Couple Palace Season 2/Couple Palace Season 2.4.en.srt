1
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:10,152
(COUPLE PALACE 2)

2
00:00:13,482 --> 00:00:14,981
(A high-speed and highly efficient project...)

3
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:16,482
(for a successful marriage)

4
00:00:17,353 --> 00:00:19,993
(Only one gateway remains before Palace Week.)

5
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,833
- Oh, what? - There's a stage.

6
00:00:24,962 --> 00:00:26,532
Maybe we're going to stand in the center.

7
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:27,861
Oh, my gosh.

8
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:29,432
I'm suddenly getting goosebumps.

9
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:33,103
- There's a stage. - There's a stage.

10
00:00:33,373 --> 00:00:34,572
I'm all excited.

11
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:36,602
Do we get to decide...

12
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:38,072
whether we leave or not?

13
00:00:38,612 --> 00:00:40,712
Oh, this is crazy.

14
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:42,812
What's it going to be? Seriously.

15
00:00:42,813 --> 00:00:44,533
(All 48 single men and women have entered.)

16
00:00:45,353 --> 00:00:47,982
We'll now decide the final members...

17
00:00:47,983 --> 00:00:50,523
who'll get to enter Palace Week.

18
00:00:50,993 --> 00:00:52,791
- Right away? - Right away?

19
00:00:52,792 --> 00:00:53,862
Oh, my gosh.

20
00:00:54,192 --> 00:00:56,391
Men and women...

21
00:00:56,392 --> 00:00:58,331
who pick each other today...

22
00:00:58,332 --> 00:01:00,762
will head to Palace Week together.

23
00:01:01,203 --> 00:01:03,323
The number of couples who can enter Palace Week is...

24
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:05,801
fifteen.

25
00:01:05,802 --> 00:01:06,843
Fifteen?

26
00:01:07,073 --> 00:01:08,542
That's half of us.

27
00:01:08,543 --> 00:01:10,411
And when the number becomes zero...

28
00:01:10,412 --> 00:01:12,111
(When the number of couples allowed in Palace Week hits 0)

29
00:01:12,112 --> 00:01:13,812
The matching ends.

30
00:01:13,813 --> 00:01:15,142
We have to hurry.

31
00:01:15,313 --> 00:01:17,452
I shouldn't hesitate.

32
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:19,052
I must get out there first.

33
00:01:20,522 --> 00:01:22,582
Let the first matching begin.

34
00:01:24,052 --> 00:01:25,092
- Oh, my. - Oh, my.

35
00:01:25,093 --> 00:01:26,333
Who are they going to call out?

36
00:01:26,392 --> 00:01:29,063
(Men rush to the stage.)

37
00:01:29,892 --> 00:01:31,661
That's crazy.

38
00:01:31,662 --> 00:01:33,762
It's rare for people to come up at the same time.

39
00:01:33,763 --> 00:01:35,362
That was really fast.

40
00:01:35,502 --> 00:01:37,831
It's Male Number 19.

41
00:01:37,832 --> 00:01:39,131
Okay.

42
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:40,402
(The former student president pharmacist)

43
00:01:40,403 --> 00:01:42,441
Say the number...

44
00:01:42,442 --> 00:01:44,772
you want to go to Palace Week with.

45
00:01:45,673 --> 00:01:49,882
The woman I chose is Female Number 13.

46
00:01:50,183 --> 00:01:51,351
(Proper and adorable employee at a conglomerate)

47
00:01:51,352 --> 00:01:52,581
- Female Number 13, - Female Number 13.

48
00:01:52,582 --> 00:01:53,783
Come to the matching zone.

49
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:57,892
(The two are happy just to see each other.)

50
00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:00,221
(Round 1, 1-on-1 date)

51
00:02:00,222 --> 00:02:04,762
I like Laozi, Wu wei, Kong Qiu, Mencius...

52
00:02:04,763 --> 00:02:05,862
(Eyes opening wide)

53
00:02:06,132 --> 00:02:08,262
I love oriental philosophy.

54
00:02:08,863 --> 00:02:11,232
(The two got along from the first date.)

55
00:02:11,602 --> 00:02:12,602
(Before Round 3, men's waiting room)

56
00:02:12,603 --> 00:02:14,101
It's Female Number 13.

57
00:02:14,102 --> 00:02:15,872
Who are you going to choose?

58
00:02:15,873 --> 00:02:17,742
Me? Female Number 13.

59
00:02:17,743 --> 00:02:19,772
For now, it's Female Number 13.

60
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:20,782
Female Number 13.

61
00:02:20,783 --> 00:02:23,263
- You should get to know others. - No one interests me so far.

62
00:02:23,412 --> 00:02:24,412
(Laughs)

63
00:02:24,413 --> 00:02:27,852
She's the prettiest and cutest among them.

64
00:02:28,252 --> 00:02:29,652
(Round 3, speed date)

65
00:02:29,653 --> 00:02:32,653
Have you found the one you like?

66
00:02:33,023 --> 00:02:35,563
I'm thinking about Female Number 13.

67
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:37,691
Have you gone on a date with her a lot?

68
00:02:37,692 --> 00:02:39,493
Yes, I chose her.

69
00:02:40,262 --> 00:02:41,562
You're Female Number 23.

70
00:02:41,563 --> 00:02:42,638
(On a date with someone else)

71
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,872
If you want to register the marriage in 2025, that's next year.

72
00:02:45,873 --> 00:02:47,472
That's what I'm hoping to do.

73
00:02:47,702 --> 00:02:51,942
I'm most interested in Female Number 13.

74
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,011
So I'll be rooting for you.

75
00:02:54,012 --> 00:02:55,683
- Okay, please do. - Yes.

76
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:57,412
What's wrong with this guy?

77
00:02:59,683 --> 00:03:01,552
After talking to other people,

78
00:03:01,553 --> 00:03:04,093
I liked Female Number 13 the most.

79
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,893
If you have anything to say, say it now.

80
00:03:09,762 --> 00:03:11,792
(Heart pounding)

81
00:03:11,893 --> 00:03:14,262
Let's go to the COUPLE PALACE.

82
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:18,033
(He's manly.)

83
00:03:18,273 --> 00:03:19,373
That's too sweet.

84
00:03:19,803 --> 00:03:20,803
But...

85
00:03:20,804 --> 00:03:21,971
(What?)

86
00:03:21,972 --> 00:03:23,343
It's Palace Week.

87
00:03:23,743 --> 00:03:24,743
Oh, okay.

88
00:03:25,542 --> 00:03:26,743
It was cool though.

89
00:03:26,942 --> 00:03:28,243
(Embarrassed)

90
00:03:28,813 --> 00:03:30,452
Yes, I will go with you.

91
00:03:32,352 --> 00:03:33,352
(Congratulations.)

92
00:03:33,353 --> 00:03:35,451
- Without hesitation. - Congratulations.

93
00:03:35,452 --> 00:03:38,252
You're off to Palace Week together.

94
00:03:38,422 --> 00:03:39,522
So cute.

95
00:03:39,523 --> 00:03:40,562
(Male Number 19 and Female Number 13 enter Palace Week.)

96
00:03:40,563 --> 00:03:43,063
(The two head to Palace Week shyly.)

97
00:03:43,192 --> 00:03:45,191
- The first matching was successful. - Yes.

98
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:46,393
That's very nice.

99
00:03:46,732 --> 00:03:50,063
The remaining number of couples is 14.

100
00:03:50,502 --> 00:03:51,932
- Now... - Everyone's getting ready to run.

101
00:03:51,933 --> 00:03:53,333
People are getting ready to run.

102
00:03:53,843 --> 00:03:55,773
(Nervous)

103
00:03:56,273 --> 00:03:58,113
I have no intention to leave.

104
00:03:58,472 --> 00:04:01,412
Love isn't about being nice but a war.

105
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:04,452
Let the next matching begin.

106
00:04:09,852 --> 00:04:11,152
(Clash)

107
00:04:11,153 --> 00:04:13,662
Rock-paper-scissors.

108
00:04:14,123 --> 00:04:16,092
I thought it was some kind of a game.

109
00:04:16,093 --> 00:04:17,573
Can we decide by rock-paper-scissors?

110
00:04:17,893 --> 00:04:20,633
Male Number Nine arrived first.

111
00:04:20,732 --> 00:04:22,561
They rewinded the tape.

112
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:24,903
(9: American lawyer from Season 1)

113
00:04:25,203 --> 00:04:26,972
He'd choose Female Number 25.

114
00:04:30,172 --> 00:04:31,242
I...

115
00:04:33,643 --> 00:04:35,643
(Round 3, speed date)

116
00:04:36,283 --> 00:04:38,513
I'm shocked.

117
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:43,352
(Male Number 9's date seat was vacant.)

118
00:04:44,193 --> 00:04:45,693
My prime is over.

119
00:04:48,393 --> 00:04:50,532
It's shocking that he got zero votes.

120
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:52,362
No one chose Male Number Nine, right?

121
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:54,333
Wasn't he popular?

122
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:56,561
(With a high number of votes, )

123
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:58,073
(he placed 1st in Round 1.)

124
00:04:58,802 --> 00:05:00,202
Male Number Nine doesn't have anyone.

125
00:05:00,203 --> 00:05:02,203
I wanted to talk to Male Number Nine.

126
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,612
But his preference is firm.

127
00:05:05,812 --> 00:05:08,143
- He was so firm. - Yes.

128
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:10,713
At a glance,

129
00:05:11,052 --> 00:05:13,722
Female Number 25 is my type.

130
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:17,323
She's pretty much identical to Eun Ye Sol.

131
00:05:18,093 --> 00:05:20,662
We got along in every way.

132
00:05:21,893 --> 00:05:24,562
But she didn't vote for me.

133
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:28,833
Is she not interested in me anymore?

134
00:05:29,003 --> 00:05:30,833
I was quite disappointed.

135
00:05:33,872 --> 00:05:36,202
(Male Number 9 asked Female Number 25 on a date.)

136
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:39,273
Hello. How have you been?

137
00:05:41,343 --> 00:05:43,083
So so.

138
00:05:43,883 --> 00:05:45,252
(Awkward silence between the two)

139
00:05:45,253 --> 00:05:46,453
Okay.

140
00:05:47,552 --> 00:05:49,253
I'll just pretend that you were late.

141
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:52,193
(Male Number 9 tries to loosen up the mood.)

142
00:05:52,792 --> 00:05:55,562
I knew you'd want to get to know others.

143
00:05:56,593 --> 00:05:57,993
And that's why you're on this show.

144
00:05:59,432 --> 00:06:02,362
But I can't say I wasn't disappointed.

145
00:06:03,432 --> 00:06:07,072
To be honest, I expected you to be so popular.

146
00:06:07,073 --> 00:06:08,673
So I played smart and didn't choose you.

147
00:06:08,903 --> 00:06:11,311
If you came to me,

148
00:06:11,312 --> 00:06:12,992
I would've let other women go immediately.

149
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:15,082
I'll just keep repeating, "It was fun, bye."

150
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,483
(Male Number 9 keeps making jokes.)

151
00:06:18,352 --> 00:06:19,452
But...

152
00:06:19,453 --> 00:06:20,721
(But...)

153
00:06:20,722 --> 00:06:22,083
(Nervous)

154
00:06:22,622 --> 00:06:24,452
What worries me is that...

155
00:06:24,453 --> 00:06:26,852
you want to raise children in the States.

156
00:06:27,263 --> 00:06:29,462
(Round 1, 1-on-1 date)

157
00:06:29,463 --> 00:06:32,161
(Male Number 9's hidden condition: Raise children in the States.)

158
00:06:32,162 --> 00:06:34,061
What do you think about living in the States?

159
00:06:34,062 --> 00:06:36,533
I'll have to think about it.

160
00:06:37,133 --> 00:06:39,601
Female Number 25 was hesitant...

161
00:06:39,602 --> 00:06:41,242
about my condition for marriage.

162
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:45,513
It seems that you see yourself as an American.

163
00:06:46,812 --> 00:06:49,842
Raising children in the States is one of the qualifications...

164
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:52,083
I can offer to my family.

165
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,083
You can't buy US citizenship with money.

166
00:07:00,122 --> 00:07:01,922
I can't wait to find out.

167
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,362
Hello.

168
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:08,533
Hello.

169
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,732
Although it was a very short time,

170
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,041
if you could go to Palace Week with me,

171
00:07:15,042 --> 00:07:16,671
I'd be very happy.

172
00:07:16,672 --> 00:07:18,912
Will you go to Palace Week with me?

173
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,143
Will you?

174
00:07:23,412 --> 00:07:24,852
"Yes, I will."

175
00:07:25,213 --> 00:07:27,453
That's sweet.

176
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:29,982
Female Number 25, what do you say?

177
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:33,893
(Will she take his hand?)

178
00:07:36,393 --> 00:07:37,592
I'm sorry.

179
00:07:37,593 --> 00:07:39,533
(I'm sorry.)

180
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:43,872
(She turned Male Number 9 down.)

181
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:46,802
Oh, no.

182
00:07:48,643 --> 00:07:52,142
(An unexpected result)

183
00:07:52,143 --> 00:07:53,172
Oh, my gosh.

184
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,411
That's unfortunate.

185
00:07:57,412 --> 00:07:59,283
Female Number 25, please return to your seat.

186
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:03,083
(Female Number 25 returns to her seat.)

187
00:08:03,523 --> 00:08:06,252
He said we could work it out,

188
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:09,022
but he sounded like he wanted to go back to the States.

189
00:08:09,023 --> 00:08:12,763
So I couldn't really say yes.

190
00:08:15,463 --> 00:08:16,861
I was flustered.

191
00:08:16,862 --> 00:08:20,003
(Male Number 9 leaves COUPLE PALACE alone.)

192
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,671
Did I do something wrong?

193
00:08:23,672 --> 00:08:25,142
Was I too arrogant?

194
00:08:25,143 --> 00:08:26,972
Was I too straightforward?

195
00:08:28,182 --> 00:08:32,451
I'm disappointed...

196
00:08:32,452 --> 00:08:34,023
that I made the same mistake twice.

197
00:08:37,592 --> 00:08:38,951
(Who will become the next couple?)

198
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:41,123
Let the next matching begin.

199
00:08:41,592 --> 00:08:42,622
Me.

200
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:43,662
(Me.)

201
00:08:45,432 --> 00:08:46,493
Female Number Eight.

202
00:08:46,662 --> 00:08:48,402
- She's the beauty creator. - Yes.

203
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:51,732
With 1.3 million subscribers.

204
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:53,872
(Male Number 3 is nervous to see Female Number 8.)

205
00:08:53,873 --> 00:08:57,072
She might call up Male Number Three.

206
00:08:58,942 --> 00:09:01,082
Male Number Three was popular.

207
00:09:02,283 --> 00:09:05,451
I thought about a way to appeal to him,

208
00:09:05,452 --> 00:09:07,012
then ta-da.

209
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,152
(Ta-da)

210
00:09:08,153 --> 00:09:09,181
What's that?

211
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:11,421
I wrote down the topics for today.

212
00:09:11,422 --> 00:09:12,492
(Conversation topics written on her finger)

213
00:09:12,493 --> 00:09:13,522
(Staring)

214
00:09:13,523 --> 00:09:16,992
I appealed to him...

215
00:09:16,993 --> 00:09:20,092
that I was making an effort.

216
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:21,561
And...

217
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,632
- Hello. - Hello.

218
00:09:23,633 --> 00:09:25,132
Male Number 28...

219
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:28,802
kept sending me hearts when we were talking.

220
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,513
- I have one. - You're so cute.

221
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:34,182
You're so feminine.

222
00:09:34,412 --> 00:09:36,642
A child will be adorable if she takes after you.

223
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:37,963
You even have a sense of justice?

224
00:09:38,283 --> 00:09:39,883
You're like a princess.

225
00:09:40,952 --> 00:09:42,522
You're good at complimenting.

226
00:09:42,523 --> 00:09:43,753
Tell me more.

227
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:44,892
You want more? Okay.

228
00:09:44,893 --> 00:09:45,893
(I'd be happy to.)

229
00:09:45,894 --> 00:09:47,992
(They're already in their own bubble.)

230
00:09:47,993 --> 00:09:51,363
Thank you for finding the child in me.

231
00:09:51,462 --> 00:09:53,132
My heart is melting.

232
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:54,133
(Lots of acting cute)

233
00:09:54,562 --> 00:09:56,301
I had a lot of fun...

234
00:09:56,302 --> 00:09:58,503
talking with Male Number 28.

235
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:02,941
What? This could be okay.

236
00:10:02,942 --> 00:10:04,143
Maybe I like him.

237
00:10:05,273 --> 00:10:08,283
(Towards whom will her heart point?)

238
00:10:08,383 --> 00:10:12,081
The male participant I'd like to go to Palace Week with is...

239
00:10:12,082 --> 00:10:13,888
(28: Offbeat and genius assistant professor in nursing)

240
00:10:13,912 --> 00:10:15,921
(3: A corporate employee from a major Japanese company in Tokyo)

241
00:10:15,922 --> 00:10:19,322
It's Number 28.

242
00:10:20,523 --> 00:10:21,691
It's Number 28.

243
00:10:21,692 --> 00:10:22,921
(Surprised)

244
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,062
(Rushing)

245
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:26,192
Number 28!

246
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:27,432
He looks so shocked.

247
00:10:27,603 --> 00:10:29,062
What do I do?

248
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,431
- Please come up. - This way?

249
00:10:31,432 --> 00:10:32,831
Even his walking is offbeat.

250
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:33,832
Yes.

251
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,273
(He's cute.)

252
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:38,012
Throughout our conversation,

253
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:40,312
he kept sending me hearts from his eyes.

254
00:10:40,412 --> 00:10:43,842
I thought, "Number 28 must think a lot about me."

255
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:49,082
I had so much fun talking with you.

256
00:10:49,653 --> 00:10:51,322
(Moved)

257
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:53,692
Will you join me at Palace Week?

258
00:10:54,562 --> 00:10:56,993
I also enjoyed our time together.

259
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:58,292
I'm so moved.

260
00:10:58,962 --> 00:11:00,332
(On top of the world)

261
00:11:00,562 --> 00:11:02,103
It's a beautiful night.

262
00:11:03,503 --> 00:11:05,633
(It's a party.)

263
00:11:06,103 --> 00:11:07,233
Yes, let's go.

264
00:11:09,873 --> 00:11:11,171
Congratulations.

265
00:11:11,172 --> 00:11:12,472
- Congratulations. - It's a beautiful night.

266
00:11:12,473 --> 00:11:13,953
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

267
00:11:14,013 --> 00:11:15,982
Why is your hand so cold?

268
00:11:15,983 --> 00:11:17,382
May I warm it up for you?

269
00:11:17,383 --> 00:11:18,581
- Thank you. - Sure.

270
00:11:18,582 --> 00:11:20,653
(Holding each other hands tightly)

271
00:11:21,153 --> 00:11:22,652
(Who's the next woman in the matching zone?)

272
00:11:22,653 --> 00:11:24,022
Female Number Nine.

273
00:11:24,023 --> 00:11:25,252
(9: An open-minded Samsung employee who studied abroad)

274
00:11:25,253 --> 00:11:26,451
(Annual salary of 70,000 dollars)

275
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:29,523
My condition for marriage is clear.

276
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:32,862
There aren't many men who can meet...

277
00:11:32,863 --> 00:11:34,133
that clear-cut condition.

278
00:11:34,233 --> 00:11:36,562
(11: A head dentist at the best dental clinic in Bupyeong)

279
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:37,733
(How were her dates during Round 3?)

280
00:11:37,734 --> 00:11:38,832
I could definitely do it.

281
00:11:39,603 --> 00:11:40,942
That's amazing.

282
00:11:41,403 --> 00:11:43,171
I'm so glad that I lined up to talk to you.

283
00:11:43,172 --> 00:11:44,341
Thank you.

284
00:11:44,342 --> 00:11:46,742
You want a nice place after getting married.

285
00:11:46,743 --> 00:11:48,263
- Yes. - Does it have to be in Songdo?

286
00:11:48,312 --> 00:11:50,752
There aren't many that are worth 2 million dollars in Songdo.

287
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:52,513
(And...)

288
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,822
Man is all about confidence.

289
00:11:55,483 --> 00:11:57,622
I don't need just groundless confidence.

290
00:11:57,623 --> 00:11:59,322
I need him to be specific.

291
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,263
(Male Number 26 lost his confidence.)

292
00:12:02,363 --> 00:12:03,523
My head hurts.

293
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:08,701
Which man would you like to go to Palace Week with?

294
00:12:08,702 --> 00:12:10,983
(Which man does Number 9 want to go to Palace Week with?)

295
00:12:12,603 --> 00:12:15,672
Number 26, could you come up?

296
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:19,341
She called Number 26.

297
00:12:19,342 --> 00:12:22,182
He's the DJing patent attorney slash attorney.

298
00:12:22,613 --> 00:12:24,551
They went on many dates together.

299
00:12:24,552 --> 00:12:26,753
(They face each other again on the matching zone.)

300
00:12:27,452 --> 00:12:31,253
I haven't found it yet during our three dates.

301
00:12:31,353 --> 00:12:33,992
I'd like to find your soft spot...

302
00:12:33,993 --> 00:12:36,763
that's hiding behind your chic exterior.

303
00:12:37,393 --> 00:12:38,831
(She's such a smooth flirt.)

304
00:12:38,832 --> 00:12:40,292
"Soft spot?"

305
00:12:41,702 --> 00:12:45,473
Will you join me at Palace Week?

306
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,643
What will he choose?

307
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,341
- Will this work out? - I don't know.

308
00:12:51,342 --> 00:12:52,442
(Curious)

309
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,283
What's your choice?

310
00:12:55,513 --> 00:12:57,283
Let's go.

311
00:12:58,013 --> 00:12:59,311
(They connected again this time.)

312
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:00,513
Seriously.

313
00:13:00,783 --> 00:13:02,653
(Feeling happy)

314
00:13:02,952 --> 00:13:04,192
(Those are good times.)

315
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:05,992
Please say goodbye.

316
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,623
(Female Number 9 and Male Number 26 enter Palace Week.)

317
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:11,893
(The couple matching continues.)

318
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,892
(Someone calls Male Number 11.)

319
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,202
(Me?)

320
00:13:15,763 --> 00:13:17,931
I'd like to call...

321
00:13:17,932 --> 00:13:19,903
Male Number 11.

322
00:13:20,773 --> 00:13:23,403
She called out Male Number 11.

323
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:25,572
He's the dentist.

324
00:13:26,743 --> 00:13:28,783
I'd like to go to Palace Week with you...

325
00:13:28,883 --> 00:13:31,783
and find out how we feel about each other.

326
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:35,222
Will you join me at Palace Week?

327
00:13:35,223 --> 00:13:37,993
(Will you join me at Palace Week?)

328
00:13:39,123 --> 00:13:41,199
(Men's waiting room before the Palace Week matching)

329
00:13:41,223 --> 00:13:43,291
Which number have you been seeing?

330
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:46,232
Me? I've been seeing her.

331
00:13:46,233 --> 00:13:48,202
(A beautiful elementary school teacher in Busan)

332
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:49,233
(Round 1, men's speed train)

333
00:13:49,234 --> 00:13:50,802
(Doctors)

334
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:57,342
(Number 11 captured everyone with looks and competence.)

335
00:13:58,072 --> 00:13:59,518
(11: A head dentist at the best dental clinic in Bupyeong)

336
00:13:59,542 --> 00:14:01,742
I may not look it, but I'm softhearted.

337
00:14:01,743 --> 00:14:02,842
That's how I am.

338
00:14:03,483 --> 00:14:06,711
(His 1st pick was Female Number 26.)

339
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:10,052
He became a couple with Number 11.

340
00:14:10,682 --> 00:14:13,921
I thought that he was my type.

341
00:14:13,922 --> 00:14:16,223
So my heart fluttered.

342
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:18,763
You have outstanding qualifications.

343
00:14:19,562 --> 00:14:22,232
Would it be okay for me to talk to someone like you?

344
00:14:22,233 --> 00:14:24,133
- Don't be so modest. - That's what I thought.

345
00:14:24,233 --> 00:14:27,201
There are many others who are impressive.

346
00:14:27,202 --> 00:14:29,202
Really? I'm not curious about them.

347
00:14:32,143 --> 00:14:34,841
The most important qualification...

348
00:14:34,842 --> 00:14:36,883
of the person I want to marry is...

349
00:14:36,983 --> 00:14:41,253
his competence and occupation.

350
00:14:41,753 --> 00:14:45,922
So I could imagine my future with him.

351
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,291
(26: A beautiful elementary school teacher in Busan)

352
00:14:48,292 --> 00:14:51,493
Didn't she have a beautiful voice?

353
00:14:51,763 --> 00:14:54,432
- She didn't have much impact on me. - Really?

354
00:14:54,733 --> 00:14:58,873
I've been on a date with Number 26 twice.

355
00:14:59,133 --> 00:15:01,402
If I don't pick her, I'll be criticized.

356
00:15:01,403 --> 00:15:03,503
(If I don't pick her, I'll be criticized.)

357
00:15:05,912 --> 00:15:08,783
Will you join me at Palace Week?

358
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:10,983
(Thinking)

359
00:15:11,182 --> 00:15:16,253
(How does Male Number 11 really feel?)

360
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,551
I should go.

361
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:21,263
Let's go.

362
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,393
- What was that? - He should go.

363
00:15:26,062 --> 00:15:29,002
(Male Number 11 and Female Number 26 enter Palace Week.)

364
00:15:29,003 --> 00:15:30,202
It's not what you think.

365
00:15:32,233 --> 00:15:33,802
(The couple matching continues.)

366
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:36,341
I'd like to talk to you more...

367
00:15:36,342 --> 00:15:38,311
about getting close to happiness.

368
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,773
(23: Bank teller for VIP clients)

369
00:15:39,842 --> 00:15:42,383
Will you join me at Palace Week?

370
00:15:46,283 --> 00:15:47,682
There's something cute about him.

371
00:15:47,783 --> 00:15:50,822
I don't know why he's cute.

372
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:58,032
Physically, Number Three is more of my type.

373
00:15:58,033 --> 00:16:00,432
(But she can't turn away from Male Number 3.)

374
00:16:00,962 --> 00:16:05,432
(What choice will she make?)

375
00:16:07,403 --> 00:16:09,672
Yes, I'll carry anything heavy.

376
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:12,212
- Let's go. - That's amazing.

377
00:16:12,712 --> 00:16:14,442
"I'll carry anything heavy."

378
00:16:14,812 --> 00:16:15,883
One, two, three.

379
00:16:16,783 --> 00:16:17,982
That's great.

380
00:16:17,983 --> 00:16:20,223
(Female Number 23 and Male Number 24 enter Palace Week.)

381
00:16:21,283 --> 00:16:22,759
(Male Number 8 and Female Number 12 enter Palace Week.)

382
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,393
- They're in a hurry. - They really are.

383
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,152
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

384
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:28,992
(Male Number 13 and Female Number 21 enter Palace Week.)

385
00:16:28,993 --> 00:16:30,068
(Male Number 13 and Female Number 21 enter Palace Week.)

386
00:16:30,092 --> 00:16:31,308
You may leave the matching zone.

387
00:16:31,332 --> 00:16:32,661
They're so lovely.

388
00:16:32,662 --> 00:16:33,732
(Male Number 30 and Female Number 28 enter Palace Week.)

389
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:35,363
They look similar when they smile.

390
00:16:36,702 --> 00:16:38,572
There aren't many spots left.

391
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:39,903
Seven couples left.

392
00:16:40,003 --> 00:16:41,003
Five couples left.

393
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:44,872
There's only one spot remaining.

394
00:16:44,873 --> 00:16:46,013
Everyone, you have to run.

395
00:16:46,113 --> 00:16:48,112
Let the next matching begin.

396
00:16:48,113 --> 00:16:49,613
(The last couple-matching starts.)

397
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,853
Gosh, he's quick.

398
00:16:52,253 --> 00:16:53,283
Mr. Dentist.

399
00:16:53,653 --> 00:16:56,422
Please call the one you want to go to Palace Week with.

400
00:16:57,123 --> 00:17:00,653
(Male Number 27's partner in Round 2 was Female Number 6.)

401
00:17:01,292 --> 00:17:02,522
Which number did you meet?

402
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:05,032
The dentist with fair skin.

403
00:17:05,033 --> 00:17:06,838
- The one in the middle? - The one in the middle.

404
00:17:06,862 --> 00:17:09,032
He was much better than I expected.

405
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:12,332
- Was he gentle? - He was like a teddy bear.

406
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:13,672
Gentle and soft?

407
00:17:13,673 --> 00:17:15,442
(A soft impression that reminds you of a teddy bear)

408
00:17:15,443 --> 00:17:17,203
I had a good feeling about him.

409
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:19,672
He left a good impression on me.

410
00:17:19,673 --> 00:17:23,182
I couldn't help but think about him throughout the week.

411
00:17:23,183 --> 00:17:25,183
I often caught myself thinking about him.

412
00:17:25,513 --> 00:17:27,253
(Full of anticipation again today)

413
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:29,581
(The men look for their dates)

414
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:31,622
Let's begin the speed date.

415
00:17:33,493 --> 00:17:34,561
(Male Number 27 gets up slowly.)

416
00:17:34,562 --> 00:17:35,562
Gosh.

417
00:17:36,062 --> 00:17:37,932
(Female Number 6 spots Male Number 27.)

418
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:38,933
Go.

419
00:17:44,302 --> 00:17:45,332
What's he doing?

420
00:17:46,473 --> 00:17:49,042
(Male Number 27 moves to the opposite side.)

421
00:17:49,142 --> 00:17:50,402
(Where did he head to?)

422
00:17:52,943 --> 00:17:55,413
(Female Number 25 who is on a date)

423
00:17:55,513 --> 00:17:57,742
(He's waiting in line.)

424
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,552
Why is Number Six alone?

425
00:17:59,652 --> 00:18:01,151
Didn't someone pick her?

426
00:18:01,152 --> 00:18:04,253
Male Number 27 picked her, but he didn't go up to her.

427
00:18:04,693 --> 00:18:05,993
- Why not? - What?

428
00:18:06,923 --> 00:18:09,092
(Sighing)

429
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:11,791
(A participant arrives to handle the situation.)

430
00:18:11,792 --> 00:18:14,439
- Why aren't you going up to her? - I need to talk to Number 25 first.

431
00:18:14,463 --> 00:18:16,163
- You do? - I haven't had a chance yet.

432
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:18,332
Her seat is empty.

433
00:18:18,872 --> 00:18:20,972
I need to talk to her first. It's empty anyway.

434
00:18:20,973 --> 00:18:22,901
I need to talk to her first. It's empty anyway.

435
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:25,013
(It's empty anyway.)

436
00:18:26,013 --> 00:18:28,412
I really enjoyed our one-on-one date,

437
00:18:28,413 --> 00:18:29,882
but today...

438
00:18:31,713 --> 00:18:36,422
I was the only woman sitting down alone.

439
00:18:36,423 --> 00:18:38,592
It was awful,

440
00:18:39,693 --> 00:18:42,822
and I felt very miserable.

441
00:18:44,292 --> 00:18:48,061
Didn't Number Six pick you?

442
00:18:48,062 --> 00:18:49,062
No, she didn't.

443
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:51,233
That's what I don't understand.

444
00:18:52,003 --> 00:18:53,673
(During the men's speed date)

445
00:18:54,503 --> 00:18:58,973
(Female Number 6 didn't give her profile card to Male Number 27.)

446
00:18:59,612 --> 00:19:01,382
Number 6 gave out all her 3 cards.

447
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:03,642
I'm doomed.

448
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,483
Why did she use them all up?

449
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:09,151
I had a good conversation with Number Six.

450
00:19:09,152 --> 00:19:10,953
I'm shocked that she didn't give me one.

451
00:19:11,993 --> 00:19:13,352
I shouldn't pick her either.

452
00:19:14,152 --> 00:19:16,762
My 1st pick was Number 6.

453
00:19:16,763 --> 00:19:17,861
(Number 27 brings up Number 6.)

454
00:19:17,862 --> 00:19:20,033
She didn't pick me. To be honest, I picked her.

455
00:19:20,892 --> 00:19:23,078
- You should talk to her... - No, I'll change my first pick.

456
00:19:23,102 --> 00:19:24,332
- Really? - Yes.

457
00:19:24,733 --> 00:19:26,101
We had a good conversation.

458
00:19:26,102 --> 00:19:27,232
(He keeps complaining.)

459
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:29,113
- There was a good vibe. - Were you bummed out?

460
00:19:29,203 --> 00:19:31,572
No, I was more flustered than bummed out.

461
00:19:31,743 --> 00:19:34,982
Most women picked men whom they hadn't talked to yet.

462
00:19:34,983 --> 00:19:37,012
And men picked women...

463
00:19:37,013 --> 00:19:39,312
whom they already talked to.

464
00:19:40,052 --> 00:19:41,982
So women are smarter.

465
00:19:41,983 --> 00:19:42,983
Those they talked to...

466
00:19:42,984 --> 00:19:45,552
(Male Number 27 was upset.)

467
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:49,193
I had nothing to say because I didn't pick him.

468
00:19:49,362 --> 00:19:50,362
But in my mind,

469
00:19:50,363 --> 00:19:52,963
since I already had a conversation with him before,

470
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:55,561
I thought I should talk to other people.

471
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:57,263
It was quite simple to me.

472
00:19:57,703 --> 00:19:59,649
I was trying to narrow down three different guys.

473
00:19:59,673 --> 00:20:01,071
I must have made a mistake there.

474
00:20:01,072 --> 00:20:02,952
I must have made the wrong call at that moment.

475
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:05,972
But if he really wanted to talk to me,

476
00:20:05,973 --> 00:20:08,683
he would have come to me right away when I was alone.

477
00:20:09,283 --> 00:20:10,811
(After a long wait, )

478
00:20:10,812 --> 00:20:11,812
(they finally face one another.)

479
00:20:11,813 --> 00:20:13,482
- Hello. - Hello.

480
00:20:13,483 --> 00:20:14,723
I've been lonely.

481
00:20:14,983 --> 00:20:16,483
My gosh, why would you be lonely?

482
00:20:16,652 --> 00:20:18,652
- I was lonely. - Why would you be lonely?

483
00:20:19,223 --> 00:20:21,392
Why did you go to her first and not me?

484
00:20:21,723 --> 00:20:23,463
Well, you know...

485
00:20:23,993 --> 00:20:25,591
How was your week?

486
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:27,892
- I've been so busy. - Really?

487
00:20:28,362 --> 00:20:29,861
What have you been up to?

488
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:31,601
I... What did I do?

489
00:20:31,602 --> 00:20:34,533
My mind is blank because I've been alone for too long here.

490
00:20:35,372 --> 00:20:36,503
It's like my brain reset.

491
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,442
- Why? - It was such a long wait.

492
00:20:39,443 --> 00:20:42,842
We had five profile cards.

493
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:45,111
So I wrote down five numbers.

494
00:20:45,112 --> 00:20:46,752
But they suddenly said I could only pick three.

495
00:20:46,753 --> 00:20:48,423
- So I had to remove two. - Okay.

496
00:20:48,723 --> 00:20:50,459
- So I chose them when I got here. - Gosh, you don't have to explain.

497
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:51,851
- No, you don't have to explain. - I'm serious.

498
00:20:51,852 --> 00:20:53,791
- Gosh, no. - So I was a bit upset.

499
00:20:53,792 --> 00:20:55,821
My goodness. That's nonsense.

500
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:57,723
- I'm serious. - Stop lying.

501
00:20:58,533 --> 00:21:00,613
I thought long and hard about it while waiting here.

502
00:21:01,263 --> 00:21:02,663
I was so sad.

503
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:06,673
(They hit a bump on the road due to a misunderstanding.)

504
00:21:07,902 --> 00:21:09,071
I gave it a lot of thought.

505
00:21:09,072 --> 00:21:10,641
But she's the one I talked to the most.

506
00:21:10,642 --> 00:21:12,018
(Male Number 27 is in the matching zone.)

507
00:21:12,042 --> 00:21:13,273
Female Number Six.

508
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:16,612
- Yes. - He called Female Number Six.

509
00:21:17,183 --> 00:21:19,111
She's our colleague we're rooting for.

510
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:20,992
(6: Former center member of an idol girl group)

511
00:21:21,652 --> 00:21:23,652
Would you like to go and have a good time with me?

512
00:21:23,822 --> 00:21:25,851
(Smiling)

513
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:28,122
He incorporated the title of her song in his question.

514
00:21:28,792 --> 00:21:32,033
What is Female Number Six's decision?

515
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:34,663
I'm sorry.

516
00:21:35,402 --> 00:21:36,402
(Sighing)

517
00:21:37,003 --> 00:21:40,032
(The two of them fail to match.)

518
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:42,402
Female Number Six, please go back to your seat.

519
00:21:44,203 --> 00:21:45,643
I thought you were going to say yes.

520
00:21:46,042 --> 00:21:47,072
No.

521
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:48,312
Really?

522
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,213
I think everything got messy.

523
00:21:51,983 --> 00:21:54,651
When I was trying to pick three guys,

524
00:21:54,652 --> 00:21:57,422
I didn't include Male Number 27.

525
00:21:57,423 --> 00:22:00,592
He didn't come to me when he was waiting for his turn.

526
00:22:01,152 --> 00:22:03,422
The time I had to spend alone...

527
00:22:03,423 --> 00:22:06,433
made me feel so miserable and sad.

528
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:09,902
So I pulled away too.

529
00:22:11,003 --> 00:22:13,631
Small things like this built up...

530
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:15,572
and caused our connection to fall apart.

531
00:22:16,542 --> 00:22:19,973
All right. Only one more spot remains.

532
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:23,042
This isn't easy.

533
00:22:24,213 --> 00:22:26,752
They didn't seem interested in me.

534
00:22:26,753 --> 00:22:27,812
(What happened to her?)

535
00:22:28,683 --> 00:22:30,422
(Female Number 5 overcame the pain of Season 1...)

536
00:22:30,423 --> 00:22:33,523
(and showed up with a completely different look.)

537
00:22:34,493 --> 00:22:38,163
I really want to fall in love and get married.

538
00:22:39,832 --> 00:22:40,861
(She tried to approach the guys proactively.)

539
00:22:40,862 --> 00:22:41,862
Hello.

540
00:22:42,602 --> 00:22:44,003
What's your ideal type?

541
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:46,973
I like women who look kind.

542
00:22:47,102 --> 00:22:48,202
I'm kind.

543
00:22:48,203 --> 00:22:49,342
(Smiling)

544
00:22:49,642 --> 00:22:50,772
Right.

545
00:22:50,773 --> 00:22:51,871
(Flustered)

546
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:54,642
Do you think you and I can have another conversation?

547
00:22:54,943 --> 00:22:57,183
I'd like to talk to other women too.

548
00:22:57,483 --> 00:22:59,512
(Feeling bitter)

549
00:22:59,513 --> 00:23:01,352
Thank you for writing this.

550
00:23:02,223 --> 00:23:03,752
(I'm good at lifting heavy things.)

551
00:23:03,753 --> 00:23:04,993
When I was in grad school,

552
00:23:05,152 --> 00:23:06,992
there were a lot of events.

553
00:23:06,993 --> 00:23:08,723
So I had to move a lot of things.

554
00:23:09,062 --> 00:23:10,262
I said, "I can lift everything."

555
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,361
(Trying to appeal to him)

556
00:23:11,362 --> 00:23:12,992
That's how I got into the program.

557
00:23:12,993 --> 00:23:14,033
I see.

558
00:23:14,562 --> 00:23:16,331
So I'm good at lifting heavy things.

559
00:23:16,332 --> 00:23:17,832
I see. Thank you.

560
00:23:18,203 --> 00:23:21,433
Out of ten trains, I voted for you.

561
00:23:21,642 --> 00:23:23,372
Did you know that I did?

562
00:23:23,743 --> 00:23:26,213
Actually, you were quite far away. So I couldn't see clearly.

563
00:23:26,513 --> 00:23:29,081
Do you think we can have another conversation?

564
00:23:29,082 --> 00:23:30,283
If possible, sure.

565
00:23:32,082 --> 00:23:36,422
When I asked them if we could talk again,

566
00:23:36,423 --> 00:23:38,263
- What did they say? - all of their answers...

567
00:23:39,122 --> 00:23:40,752
- didn't sound... - Did they hesitate?

568
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,693
Right. They didn't sound certain.

569
00:23:44,362 --> 00:23:46,562
Dating is so hard, seriously.

570
00:23:46,733 --> 00:23:48,401
- It's so hard to meet people. - Dating is so hard.

571
00:23:48,402 --> 00:23:49,831
The feelings have to be mutual.

572
00:23:49,832 --> 00:23:52,173
Having your feelings reciprocated is so rare.

573
00:23:55,302 --> 00:23:57,071
I don't know what's going to happen.

574
00:23:57,072 --> 00:23:58,672
(Female Number 5 has a lot on her mind after Round 3.)

575
00:23:58,673 --> 00:24:00,572
The person I would like to choose...

576
00:24:01,213 --> 00:24:02,513
is Female Number Five.

577
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:05,111
(21: Canadian model with a height of 193cm)

578
00:24:05,112 --> 00:24:06,851
(The person I would like to choose is Female Number 5.)

579
00:24:06,852 --> 00:24:07,882
Female Number Five?

580
00:24:08,052 --> 00:24:10,052
They did have a date earlier.

581
00:24:11,052 --> 00:24:12,492
(Male Number 21 and Female Number 5 had a date.)

582
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:15,723
One of the many reasons I voted for you during the speed train...

583
00:24:16,062 --> 00:24:17,762
was that you had a beautiful voice.

584
00:24:17,763 --> 00:24:19,509
- You have such a beautiful voice. - Really?

585
00:24:19,533 --> 00:24:23,963
(Female Number 5's calming voice...)

586
00:24:24,973 --> 00:24:27,672
(charmed Male Number 21.)

587
00:24:27,673 --> 00:24:29,973
Her attitude and aura?

588
00:24:30,243 --> 00:24:31,973
And she had a beautiful voice.

589
00:24:33,142 --> 00:24:34,212
I was quite surprised.

590
00:24:34,213 --> 00:24:37,283
That was the biggest reason I voted for you at first.

591
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:39,582
Do you think we could talk again?

592
00:24:40,413 --> 00:24:41,483
Yes.

593
00:24:43,052 --> 00:24:44,052
They make a good couple.

594
00:24:44,053 --> 00:24:45,622
They do because he's a model.

595
00:24:45,953 --> 00:24:50,592
We only got to talk briefly.

596
00:24:50,763 --> 00:24:53,562
I'd like to talk to you more at Palace Week.

597
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:56,163
Will you join me at Palace Week?

598
00:24:57,562 --> 00:25:00,003
Yes, I will.

599
00:25:00,872 --> 00:25:02,742
(They make a good couple.)

600
00:25:02,743 --> 00:25:03,872
Congratulations.

601
00:25:04,602 --> 00:25:06,513
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

602
00:25:07,413 --> 00:25:09,558
- They look great together. - They look like a model couple.

603
00:25:09,582 --> 00:25:10,881
You guys make a great couple.

604
00:25:10,882 --> 00:25:12,311
My goodness. I can't believe this.

605
00:25:12,312 --> 00:25:13,851
Congratulations.

606
00:25:13,852 --> 00:25:15,332
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

607
00:25:16,122 --> 00:25:17,582
"We'll live happily ever after."

608
00:25:18,082 --> 00:25:19,952
- They're not married yet. - Not yet?

609
00:25:19,953 --> 00:25:24,023
(A total of 15 couples will join Palace Week.)

610
00:25:24,592 --> 00:25:28,703
(Singing passionately)

611
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,861
I love it.

612
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,402
(Over the moon)

613
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:35,442
I don't know what it is. I kept saying he was cute.

614
00:25:35,443 --> 00:25:37,402
I just kept saying he was cute.

615
00:25:37,773 --> 00:25:40,173
So there isn't a clear answer or anything.

616
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:43,243
Yes. He's just cute.

617
00:25:43,812 --> 00:25:46,983
We will become the best-looking couple in Season Two.

618
00:25:47,453 --> 00:25:49,052
We'll be the hottest couple.

619
00:25:49,552 --> 00:25:50,651
(Satisfied)

620
00:25:50,652 --> 00:25:52,652
(The hottest and the best-looking couple is born.)

621
00:25:57,423 --> 00:25:59,162
(Palace Week: 15 couples will live together...)

622
00:25:59,163 --> 00:26:01,361
(to prepare for marriage.)

623
00:26:01,362 --> 00:26:03,162
The place where love and reality meet.

624
00:26:03,163 --> 00:26:05,371
You will meet your perfect person for marriage right here,

625
00:26:05,372 --> 00:26:08,703
on COUPLE PALACE 2. This is Palace Week.

626
00:26:09,673 --> 00:26:10,901
During Palace Week,

627
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,541
there's a single zone...

628
00:26:12,542 --> 00:26:14,588
where you can freely look for your marriage partner.

629
00:26:14,612 --> 00:26:16,782
And there's the couple zone where you and your partner...

630
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,482
can prepare for marriage in private.

631
00:26:18,483 --> 00:26:20,051
(They can prepare for marriage in the couple zone.)

632
00:26:20,052 --> 00:26:22,683
But if you don't see eye to eye in the couple zone,

633
00:26:22,923 --> 00:26:24,923
you can give up on remaining as a couple.

634
00:26:25,723 --> 00:26:27,323
If you give up on remaining as a couple,

635
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:30,723
you can look for another partner in the single zone.

636
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:33,532
Lastly, there's a rule...

637
00:26:33,533 --> 00:26:35,832
that applies to both zones.

638
00:26:36,362 --> 00:26:38,473
It's the secret mailbox.

639
00:26:39,273 --> 00:26:42,443
You can request a secret date at any time through the mailbox.

640
00:26:42,802 --> 00:26:46,173
Then you can go on a secret date without letting anyone know.

641
00:26:47,342 --> 00:26:49,542
The matchmakers will provide their recommendations,

642
00:26:50,013 --> 00:26:52,713
and there will be various dates, tailored to your preferences.

643
00:26:53,152 --> 00:26:55,822
At Palace Week, you will have numerous chances to meet people.

644
00:26:56,352 --> 00:26:58,492
Who will succeed in the final proposal...

645
00:26:58,493 --> 00:27:02,362
and find their perfect partner for marriage?

646
00:27:04,362 --> 00:27:06,562
Palace Week has begun at last.

647
00:27:06,963 --> 00:27:09,632
We began with 60 single men and women.

648
00:27:09,802 --> 00:27:11,703
Only 15 couples were matched.

649
00:27:11,933 --> 00:27:13,733
And they will join Palace Week.

650
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:14,933
I can't wait.

651
00:27:14,934 --> 00:27:16,442
I bet I have a lot to say here...

652
00:27:16,443 --> 00:27:17,541
because I'm the only one...

653
00:27:17,542 --> 00:27:18,542
- Right. - Yes.

654
00:27:18,543 --> 00:27:19,571
- who's married. - Yes.

655
00:27:19,572 --> 00:27:21,042
I'm the only married one.

656
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,581
Female Number Ten said she liked short guys.

657
00:27:23,582 --> 00:27:24,682
Right.

658
00:27:24,683 --> 00:27:25,982
- Right. - So you know about her.

659
00:27:25,983 --> 00:27:28,352
- That gave me a lot of hope. - Right.

660
00:27:28,582 --> 00:27:30,582
So I decided to join the show to offer my insight.

661
00:27:30,683 --> 00:27:31,723
I...

662
00:27:32,193 --> 00:27:33,492
(Palace Week begins.)

663
00:27:33,493 --> 00:27:34,592
This place looks great.

664
00:27:35,622 --> 00:27:36,763
They're coming in.

665
00:27:37,292 --> 00:27:39,463
Hyun Joong, an employee at Company L.

666
00:27:39,562 --> 00:27:41,831
And that's Si Yeon who likes short guys.

667
00:27:41,832 --> 00:27:44,162
Jae Yeon, the oral surgeon who plays Pump It Up.

668
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:46,733
Joo Hee, the pharmacist who likes anime and games.

669
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,242
Sin Da, who wants a marital house...

670
00:27:49,243 --> 00:27:50,901
worth over two million dollars.

671
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:53,913
Jung Won, the DJing patent attorney and legal attorney.

672
00:27:54,542 --> 00:27:57,012
(The club lounge)

673
00:27:57,013 --> 00:27:58,413
- Hello. - Hello.

674
00:28:01,253 --> 00:28:02,253
My name.

675
00:28:02,254 --> 00:28:04,651
Jin Ju, the bank clerk who doesn't like petty-looking lips.

676
00:28:04,652 --> 00:28:06,723
And Sang Gyeong, the dermatologist.

677
00:28:06,923 --> 00:28:08,621
At Palace Week, they will go by their name,

678
00:28:08,622 --> 00:28:10,292
not their number.

679
00:28:11,592 --> 00:28:12,963
My name...

680
00:28:14,163 --> 00:28:15,203
Si Yeon.

681
00:28:15,763 --> 00:28:18,473
You can't open it until you are instructed to do so.

682
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:22,602
(A secret card)

683
00:28:23,173 --> 00:28:25,371
You can't open the envelope until you are instructed to do so.

684
00:28:25,372 --> 00:28:27,189
(They receive a mysterious envelope along with their name tag.)

685
00:28:27,213 --> 00:28:28,412
(They can't open the secret card until they're instructed to do so.)

686
00:28:28,413 --> 00:28:30,342
- What's that? - I'm so curious.

687
00:28:30,913 --> 00:28:32,051
What? What's this?

688
00:28:32,052 --> 00:28:33,783
This wasn't in the last season.

689
00:28:33,953 --> 00:28:35,582
I thought things were quite different.

690
00:28:36,753 --> 00:28:39,152
I have no clue what it is.

691
00:28:39,352 --> 00:28:41,291
I was told not to open it.

692
00:28:41,292 --> 00:28:42,923
So I became more curious.

693
00:28:44,463 --> 00:28:47,561
Actually, things get real starting at Palace Week.

694
00:28:47,562 --> 00:28:48,663
Things will get crazy.

695
00:28:48,832 --> 00:28:50,808
I'm getting excited for them. Palace Week is the highlight.

696
00:28:50,832 --> 00:28:52,131
(The matched couples will meet for the first time here.)

697
00:28:52,132 --> 00:28:54,273
- My gosh, where is this place? - It looks beautiful.

698
00:28:54,832 --> 00:28:58,342
(The men are waiting for the ladies nervously with some excitement.)

699
00:28:58,642 --> 00:29:01,713
(And at that moment...)

700
00:29:01,913 --> 00:29:03,012
They're this season's solid couple.

701
00:29:03,013 --> 00:29:04,013
Right.

702
00:29:04,014 --> 00:29:06,112
It's Yeong Seok, the pharmacist, and Soo Min.

703
00:29:06,352 --> 00:29:08,753
- Soo Min. - Yes, Yeong Seok.

704
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,651
- What's your last name? - It's Kim Soo Min.

705
00:29:10,652 --> 00:29:11,783
- Kim Soo Min? - Yes.

706
00:29:12,122 --> 00:29:13,693
- What's your last name? - Cho.

707
00:29:14,122 --> 00:29:15,322
Cho Yeong Seok.

708
00:29:17,993 --> 00:29:20,361
My goodness. He smiled the moment he saw her.

709
00:29:20,362 --> 00:29:21,492
(It's Joo Hee who made him smile.)

710
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:23,203
- Hello. - They're such a cute couple.

711
00:29:23,733 --> 00:29:25,102
Why do you look so nice?

712
00:29:25,273 --> 00:29:26,632
I wanted to look nice.

713
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:29,273
- This week went by so slowly. - My gosh.

714
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:32,082
- Same here. How fascinating. - I guess I just couldn't wait.

715
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:34,571
Right. This will be fun.

716
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:36,141
I smoked cigarettes...

717
00:29:36,142 --> 00:29:37,882
with the other guys at the last shoot.

718
00:29:38,413 --> 00:29:39,683
What? That's not good.

719
00:29:40,483 --> 00:29:41,551
(During the 1-on-1 date)

720
00:29:41,552 --> 00:29:42,722
Do you drink or smoke?

721
00:29:42,723 --> 00:29:44,182
I used to smoke.

722
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:45,493
- You used to smoke? - Yes.

723
00:29:46,152 --> 00:29:47,291
That's unexpected.

724
00:29:47,292 --> 00:29:48,962
(Joo Hee reacted negatively about smoking.)

725
00:29:48,963 --> 00:29:51,663
I used to say this to my friends all the time.

726
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:54,392
"I'll quit if the girl I like doesn't want me to smoke."

727
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:56,432
So I haven't smoked since the last shoot.

728
00:29:56,433 --> 00:29:57,433
It's been five days.

729
00:29:58,203 --> 00:30:01,402
I thought it was cool that he openly expressed his interest.

730
00:30:02,203 --> 00:30:04,242
- My gosh. - It's not easy to quit smoking.

731
00:30:04,243 --> 00:30:06,173
- It's not easy. - Gosh, it's not easy.

732
00:30:06,872 --> 00:30:08,311
Do you want to know something interesting?

733
00:30:08,312 --> 00:30:09,312
What is it?

734
00:30:10,382 --> 00:30:12,783
- You were in my dream. - Really? Me?

735
00:30:13,913 --> 00:30:15,252
What did I do in your dream?

736
00:30:15,253 --> 00:30:16,453
- In my dream? - Yes.

737
00:30:16,923 --> 00:30:19,692
We went to an arcade together.

738
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:21,391
(He was with her even in his dream.)

739
00:30:21,392 --> 00:30:23,892
I went to an arcade even in my dream.

740
00:30:25,562 --> 00:30:27,993
So your name is Hyun Joong.

741
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:29,401
(Hyun Joong and Si Yeon get to know each other's names.)

742
00:30:29,402 --> 00:30:31,062
- Si Yeon. - Yes.

743
00:30:31,832 --> 00:30:32,901
Hyun Joong.

744
00:30:32,902 --> 00:30:35,243
- Female Number Ten. Si Yeon. - Yes?

745
00:30:36,402 --> 00:30:38,172
Seeing her after a break...

746
00:30:38,173 --> 00:30:41,342
gave me butterflies again.

747
00:30:44,743 --> 00:30:46,183
My gosh. What?

748
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:48,452
Is she not coming?

749
00:30:48,453 --> 00:30:50,013
(As he was getting tired of waiting...)

750
00:30:50,283 --> 00:30:51,923
Our hot girl is here.

751
00:30:52,792 --> 00:30:54,252
Hello.

752
00:30:54,253 --> 00:30:56,098
(Sin Da, whom he's been waiting for has arrived.)

753
00:30:56,122 --> 00:30:59,233
Wait. So your name is Jung Won.

754
00:30:59,493 --> 00:31:02,302
I see. You have a unique name.

755
00:31:02,433 --> 00:31:04,763
What does your name mean?

756
00:31:05,203 --> 00:31:06,601
My name consists of Chinese characters.

757
00:31:06,602 --> 00:31:07,933
- Chinese characters? - Yes.

758
00:31:08,072 --> 00:31:10,801
The character for "Sin" contains three Chinese characters for gold.

759
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:13,442
"Da" means to reach.

760
00:31:13,443 --> 00:31:16,042
- It means to bring a lot of gold? - A lot of it. Right.

761
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,983
Is your last name Gold, perhaps?

762
00:31:19,683 --> 00:31:22,652
You're not as creative as I thought.

763
00:31:22,783 --> 00:31:24,051
Once you hear it, you won't forget it.

764
00:31:24,076 --> 00:31:26,646
- It's pretty unique. - It's unique.

765
00:31:26,892 --> 00:31:28,092
- Oh Sin Da. - Yes.

766
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:29,663
That's correct.

767
00:31:30,892 --> 00:31:33,862
(All the couples are seated now.)

768
00:31:36,602 --> 00:31:38,601
Welcome to Palace Week...

769
00:31:38,602 --> 00:31:41,872
where you will get to know each other at a deeper level.

770
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:43,973
Welcome.

771
00:31:45,542 --> 00:31:48,172
First, we'll give you some time...

772
00:31:48,173 --> 00:31:50,782
to verify your matched partner.

773
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:51,842
What?

774
00:31:52,013 --> 00:31:54,453
Based on new information from your partner,

775
00:31:54,582 --> 00:31:56,952
complete each other's profile card.

776
00:31:56,953 --> 00:31:58,752
- This time around, - You must complete...

777
00:31:58,753 --> 00:32:01,121
- we must verify everything. - the profile card truthfully...

778
00:32:01,122 --> 00:32:02,262
without any false information.

779
00:32:02,263 --> 00:32:03,583
(Profile of Your Matched Partner)

780
00:32:03,693 --> 00:32:05,693
(What does their mysterious laughter mean?)

781
00:32:05,993 --> 00:32:08,091
- Gosh, this is so detailed. - There are so many categories.

782
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,631
These questions are so straightforward.

783
00:32:09,632 --> 00:32:11,462
- Right. They're so straightforward. - Seriously.

784
00:32:11,463 --> 00:32:13,802
This is why the show is known to be highly efficient.

785
00:32:14,402 --> 00:32:16,482
We can find out a lot of information in one sitting.

786
00:32:16,943 --> 00:32:18,783
What could this be? Record of plastic surgery?

787
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:23,182
I'm planning to get one. So how should I answer this?

788
00:32:23,183 --> 00:32:25,142
I'm going to get the double-eyelid surgery.

789
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,483
As for my date of birth, I was born in 1987.

790
00:32:28,652 --> 00:32:30,753
You were born in September of 1987.

791
00:32:30,923 --> 00:32:32,592
- September 29. - September 29.

792
00:32:33,322 --> 00:32:35,592
Do you want to guess my birth year?

793
00:32:35,792 --> 00:32:37,091
- The age. - That's important.

794
00:32:37,092 --> 00:32:38,852
- They have to share their age now. - Right.

795
00:32:39,993 --> 00:32:41,192
- Is it 1983? - You think it's 1983?

796
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:42,262
Yes.

797
00:32:42,263 --> 00:32:43,763
- I'm older than that. - Older?

798
00:32:44,263 --> 00:32:45,601
- Is it 1981? - Year 1981?

799
00:32:45,602 --> 00:32:46,972
- Yes. - Older.

800
00:32:46,973 --> 00:32:48,301
(He was born before 1981.)

801
00:32:48,302 --> 00:32:49,342
Is it 1979?

802
00:32:49,703 --> 00:32:52,311
Yes. I was born on October 5, 1979.

803
00:32:52,312 --> 00:32:54,243
- If you were born in 1979... - Yes.

804
00:32:55,342 --> 00:32:56,482
I'm 46 years old.

805
00:32:56,483 --> 00:32:58,182
(I'm 46 years old.)

806
00:32:58,183 --> 00:32:59,581
(46 years old, 38 years old)

807
00:32:59,582 --> 00:33:01,102
- His age... - He's on the older side.

808
00:33:01,382 --> 00:33:02,922
He was...

809
00:33:02,923 --> 00:33:05,252
much older...

810
00:33:05,253 --> 00:33:07,622
than I expected.

811
00:33:08,292 --> 00:33:09,791
We'll find out each other's age now.

812
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:10,821
(Another matched couple will check each other's age.)

813
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:11,892
You must be older, right?

814
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:15,162
- I was born in 1993. - My gosh.

815
00:33:15,163 --> 00:33:16,232
(34 years old, 32 years old)

816
00:33:16,233 --> 00:33:18,361
- Yes. That's it. - You're younger than me.

817
00:33:18,362 --> 00:33:19,801
(You're younger than me.)

818
00:33:19,802 --> 00:33:20,871
Yes.

819
00:33:20,872 --> 00:33:22,243
He was younger than me.

820
00:33:22,872 --> 00:33:23,942
What?

821
00:33:23,943 --> 00:33:25,612
He was born in 1993?

822
00:33:25,812 --> 00:33:27,052
He's only a year older than me?

823
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:30,943
I was born in 1987.

824
00:33:32,042 --> 00:33:33,651
That's a huge age gap.

825
00:33:33,652 --> 00:33:34,752
(38 years old, 27 years old)

826
00:33:34,753 --> 00:33:37,082
So you were born in 1987. What's your zodiac animal?

827
00:33:37,822 --> 00:33:39,199
I was born in the Year of the Rabbit.

828
00:33:39,223 --> 00:33:40,953
You sort of look like a rabbit.

829
00:33:41,592 --> 00:33:43,963
I was born in the Year of the Tiger. Roar.

830
00:33:45,733 --> 00:33:48,392
I'm looking around the other couples,

831
00:33:48,533 --> 00:33:50,762
and now that we're wearing name tags and not numbers,

832
00:33:50,763 --> 00:33:52,172
I can't recognize them.

833
00:33:52,173 --> 00:33:53,503
- Right? Same here. - Yes.

834
00:33:53,872 --> 00:33:56,071
(Round 2, Ladies' speed train)

835
00:33:56,072 --> 00:33:57,401
(21: Musical actress who sang the theme song...)

836
00:33:57,402 --> 00:33:58,682
(of "Pororo the Little Penguin")

837
00:34:00,273 --> 00:34:02,443
(Seung Yeon sang a song with her cute voice.)

838
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:06,152
(Young Taek found her attractive.)

839
00:34:06,582 --> 00:34:10,522
(They joined Palace Week after their date from Round 2.)

840
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:12,893
Average monthly credit card spending.

841
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:16,062
I bet your spending is high.

842
00:34:16,063 --> 00:34:17,591
- But as for this, - Yes.

843
00:34:17,592 --> 00:34:19,131
- I have expenses for my business. - Yes.

844
00:34:19,132 --> 00:34:20,662
So it's a bit high.

845
00:34:20,663 --> 00:34:23,432
(He can't seem to disclose the number.)

846
00:34:23,433 --> 00:34:27,801
Including expenses for my business, it's around 8,000 to 9,000 dollars.

847
00:34:27,802 --> 00:34:29,043
My gosh, really?

848
00:34:29,873 --> 00:34:31,073
Around 8,000 to 9,000 dollars?

849
00:34:31,842 --> 00:34:33,842
I wonder if he spends more than what he earns.

850
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:36,082
Isn't that really high?

851
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:37,783
I spend about 800 to 900 dollars a month.

852
00:34:38,783 --> 00:34:40,582
Seriously? For real?

853
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:41,783
My goodness.

854
00:34:41,982 --> 00:34:44,982
But if I include expenses for work, it does go up.

855
00:34:47,322 --> 00:34:48,551
How much did you save up?

856
00:34:48,552 --> 00:34:51,862
I don't usually think about my assets.

857
00:34:52,362 --> 00:34:54,962
- I can't remember the exact number. - Okay.

858
00:34:55,192 --> 00:34:57,632
I have at least 100,000 dollars.

859
00:34:58,362 --> 00:35:01,132
- Do you spend a lot of money? - I do.

860
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:03,002
On what?

861
00:35:03,243 --> 00:35:05,372
Well, when I work as a DJ,

862
00:35:05,373 --> 00:35:07,812
I think I spend more money than I earn from the gigs.

863
00:35:07,813 --> 00:35:09,783
- So it's like a hobby. - Right.

864
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:11,759
- How much cash did you save? - I saved 70,000 dollars.

865
00:35:11,783 --> 00:35:12,881
- You saved 70,000 dollars? - Yes.

866
00:35:12,882 --> 00:35:14,382
Why did you save so much money?

867
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:18,022
So I thought you saved a lot more than that.

868
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:20,392
You make more than me.

869
00:35:20,393 --> 00:35:21,892
- Right. - You earn more than me.

870
00:35:21,893 --> 00:35:23,322
You've been working longer than me.

871
00:35:23,692 --> 00:35:26,033
My gosh. She's already scolding him.

872
00:35:26,393 --> 00:35:28,433
How often do you drink?

873
00:35:28,563 --> 00:35:30,932
Maybe once a month.

874
00:35:30,933 --> 00:35:33,373
Well, because I work as a DJ,

875
00:35:33,603 --> 00:35:35,102
I meet a lot of people.

876
00:35:35,103 --> 00:35:38,542
So you're using your DJ gigs as an excuse for everything.

877
00:35:38,543 --> 00:35:40,972
I didn't save up a lot of money because of my DJ gigs.

878
00:35:40,973 --> 00:35:43,112
I drink because of my DJ gigs.

879
00:35:44,112 --> 00:35:46,183
I'm not in debt. What about you?

880
00:35:46,683 --> 00:35:48,953
- I'm in debt. - You are?

881
00:35:49,382 --> 00:35:50,453
I owe a lot of money.

882
00:35:50,683 --> 00:35:52,322
Really? Why?

883
00:35:53,152 --> 00:35:55,192
- Is it due to his DJ gigs again? - That again?

884
00:35:56,123 --> 00:35:58,163
So I own a studio in Seoul.

885
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:00,993
And I took out a loan when I bought it.

886
00:36:01,132 --> 00:36:04,132
I was having a mental breakdown after hearing that.

887
00:36:05,132 --> 00:36:06,202
It's about one million dollars.

888
00:36:06,203 --> 00:36:07,723
(The loan is about 1 million dollars.)

889
00:36:08,103 --> 00:36:09,402
Your loan?

890
00:36:09,772 --> 00:36:11,092
- My gosh. - One million dollars?

891
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:13,542
He has a one-million-dollar loan.

892
00:36:13,543 --> 00:36:16,013
(He has a 1-million-dollar loan.)

893
00:36:16,913 --> 00:36:17,942
I...

894
00:36:18,882 --> 00:36:21,352
can never date anyone who's in debt.

895
00:36:21,353 --> 00:36:22,881
Never. I can't.

896
00:36:22,882 --> 00:36:25,223
Never.

897
00:36:27,092 --> 00:36:28,792
Ha Yeon. Are they Chinese characters?

898
00:36:28,793 --> 00:36:29,793
Yes.

899
00:36:29,822 --> 00:36:33,232
It means a flower blooming in the mud.

900
00:36:33,793 --> 00:36:34,793
That's unique.

901
00:36:34,794 --> 00:36:38,231
Even in the mud, the flower won't lose its purity.

902
00:36:38,232 --> 00:36:40,402
- Then I must make it muddy. - My gosh.

903
00:36:43,402 --> 00:36:45,171
- What's your weight? - My weight is...

904
00:36:45,172 --> 00:36:46,243
Is it 62kg?

905
00:36:47,272 --> 00:36:49,341
- I'm leaving. - Come on, okay.

906
00:36:49,342 --> 00:36:50,912
- The monthly spending... - I don't smoke.

907
00:36:50,913 --> 00:36:52,713
I'm putting down a question mark for smoking.

908
00:36:53,013 --> 00:36:55,152
(Ji Woong keeps teasing her.)

909
00:36:55,252 --> 00:36:56,722
Medical conditions for illnesses.

910
00:36:56,723 --> 00:36:58,022
- None, right? - Illnesses?

911
00:36:58,183 --> 00:37:00,021
Can I tell you now?

912
00:37:00,022 --> 00:37:02,292
I actually have a terminal illness.

913
00:37:02,293 --> 00:37:03,461
There you go again.

914
00:37:03,462 --> 00:37:05,731
I saw it from the corner of your lip.

915
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:06,993
You wanted to prank me again.

916
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,673
- He keeps trying to prank her. - He keeps pranking her.

917
00:37:10,002 --> 00:37:11,562
My eyesight is bad.

918
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:14,033
Without my contact lenses, I'm practically blind.

919
00:37:14,272 --> 00:37:17,373
- I see. - My nickname is Sunfish.

920
00:37:17,473 --> 00:37:20,313
I tend to catch any contagious disease.

921
00:37:21,013 --> 00:37:22,072
Is that okay?

922
00:37:22,342 --> 00:37:24,941
Yes. I'm super healthy.

923
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:26,182
I often get sick.

924
00:37:26,183 --> 00:37:27,783
So you must take good care of me.

925
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:29,363
I can give you a piggyback ride.

926
00:37:29,522 --> 00:37:30,952
Okay. I got it.

927
00:37:30,953 --> 00:37:32,182
- The most important one. - The date of birth.

928
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:33,793
Guess mine.

929
00:37:34,353 --> 00:37:35,922
I think you were born in 1997.

930
00:37:37,192 --> 00:37:38,492
Age-wise, it's lower than that.

931
00:37:38,493 --> 00:37:40,013
Does it mean you're younger than that?

932
00:37:40,862 --> 00:37:41,893
Were you born in 1998?

933
00:37:43,063 --> 00:37:45,203
Were you born in 1999?

934
00:37:46,732 --> 00:37:48,302
- Oh, wow. - Why?

935
00:37:49,243 --> 00:37:50,302
We're ten years apart.

936
00:37:52,572 --> 00:37:53,671
You're okay, right?

937
00:37:53,672 --> 00:37:55,142
I'm fine with that.

938
00:37:55,143 --> 00:37:58,013
But Ji Woong was quite surprised by my age.

939
00:37:58,112 --> 00:37:59,981
- It was nice knowing you. - Why?

940
00:37:59,982 --> 00:38:02,982
Take care. Find a good guy who can make you happy.

941
00:38:03,453 --> 00:38:05,022
- I... It's over. - What?

942
00:38:05,223 --> 00:38:06,492
Let's go.

943
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:09,063
- My gosh. - We're not done yet.

944
00:38:09,592 --> 00:38:10,663
Don't leave.

945
00:38:12,433 --> 00:38:13,433
We had to move...

946
00:38:13,434 --> 00:38:16,103
without having a chance to talk about our age gap.

947
00:38:16,732 --> 00:38:19,502
But I'm fine with the ten-year age gap.

948
00:38:19,703 --> 00:38:23,501
But Ji Woong might feel uncomfortable by that.

949
00:38:23,502 --> 00:38:24,643
That worries me.

950
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:28,242
- It ended so quickly. - Same here.

951
00:38:28,243 --> 00:38:30,042
- Gosh, it must've gone well then. - We didn't have much time.

952
00:38:30,043 --> 00:38:31,111
It wasn't that.

953
00:38:31,112 --> 00:38:33,393
- It was a bit boring for me. - We didn't have much time.

954
00:38:34,152 --> 00:38:35,452
From what I see,

955
00:38:35,453 --> 00:38:38,783
- she seems to like him more. - Right.

956
00:38:38,982 --> 00:38:40,622
I can't predict what will happen with them.

957
00:38:40,623 --> 00:38:42,269
(She feels frustrated not being able to finish the talk.)

958
00:38:42,293 --> 00:38:44,461
(The men and women gather after a time of verification)

959
00:38:44,462 --> 00:38:45,993
Gosh, this place looks amazing.

960
00:38:46,092 --> 00:38:47,993
My gosh, I want to get married here.

961
00:38:48,163 --> 00:38:49,401
- Do it here. - Right.

962
00:38:49,402 --> 00:38:51,362
- Invite me to your wedding. - You bet.

963
00:38:52,203 --> 00:38:54,501
- Gosh, what is this place? - Oh, my.

964
00:38:54,502 --> 00:38:55,502
This is crazy.

965
00:38:56,103 --> 00:38:59,373
This place has been optimized for you to find...

966
00:38:59,572 --> 00:39:01,143
the perfect partner for marriage.

967
00:39:02,212 --> 00:39:05,482
The single zone consists of two floors.

968
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:09,152
The second floor has six different rooms...

969
00:39:09,322 --> 00:39:11,982
where you can freely go on a date at any time.

970
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:15,122
My gosh. The building looks fancier than the one from Season One.

971
00:39:15,123 --> 00:39:16,992
There are so many places they can have their dates in.

972
00:39:16,993 --> 00:39:18,062
(They can get to know each other in the single zone.)

973
00:39:18,063 --> 00:39:20,763
- This place is beautiful. - This is the single zone.

974
00:39:20,993 --> 00:39:22,632
- Yes. - I like the single zone.

975
00:39:23,632 --> 00:39:26,032
- She loves it. - I love the single zone.

976
00:39:26,033 --> 00:39:27,702
(Joo Hee is in love with the single zone.)

977
00:39:27,703 --> 00:39:28,833
- This is nice. - Yes.

978
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,042
Should we go upstairs?

979
00:39:30,043 --> 00:39:31,763
- I want to take pictures. - We can, right?

980
00:39:32,612 --> 00:39:33,672
"A secret date."

981
00:39:34,513 --> 00:39:35,671
A ballot box? What's this?

982
00:39:35,672 --> 00:39:38,441
It says singles can only ask out a partner from the couple zone.

983
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:40,183
- A secret date? - A secret date?

984
00:39:40,313 --> 00:39:41,812
- No way. - Hold on.

985
00:39:41,813 --> 00:39:43,751
So, we're supposed to take them away.

986
00:39:43,752 --> 00:39:46,191
We didn't have this in Season One, did we?

987
00:39:46,192 --> 00:39:48,051
No. It's a new rule.

988
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,861
I bet this is going to be popular.

989
00:39:49,862 --> 00:39:51,623
The mailbox is going to be so full.

990
00:39:52,362 --> 00:39:53,433
Should we go upstairs?

991
00:39:54,033 --> 00:39:56,033
It looks like a mansion.

992
00:39:56,933 --> 00:39:58,562
- What's this? - There are so many rooms.

993
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:01,301
- So many. - The single zone seems so fun!

994
00:40:01,302 --> 00:40:02,302
What?

995
00:40:02,303 --> 00:40:04,342
How are there so many rooms?

996
00:40:05,243 --> 00:40:07,172
- What's this? - The view is fantastic.

997
00:40:07,973 --> 00:40:10,313
Now, this is Palace Week.

998
00:40:10,982 --> 00:40:13,913
I'll finally be able to have various chats here.

999
00:40:14,982 --> 00:40:16,551
- Hello. - Hello.

1000
00:40:16,552 --> 00:40:17,952
- Hi. - So your name is Young Taek.

1001
00:40:20,252 --> 00:40:22,861
(Ha Yeon is closely observing the women's lounge.)

1002
00:40:22,862 --> 00:40:24,822
Why is there one more chair?

1003
00:40:25,192 --> 00:40:26,232
There are two more.

1004
00:40:27,493 --> 00:40:29,293
- It means there will be two more. - I guess.

1005
00:40:30,362 --> 00:40:31,902
There's a female catfish this time?

1006
00:40:32,672 --> 00:40:35,203
Wait. Is this the right number of chairs?

1007
00:40:37,203 --> 00:40:39,442
Wait. There are more chairs.

1008
00:40:39,842 --> 00:40:41,342
- Sorry? - There are 16 chairs.

1009
00:40:42,013 --> 00:40:43,242
- There's 16? - Yes.

1010
00:40:43,243 --> 00:40:44,882
I knew it.

1011
00:40:45,712 --> 00:40:47,612
I wondered who they would be.

1012
00:40:47,982 --> 00:40:50,283
I thought, "The moment has finally come."

1013
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:52,723
I knew there would be more.

1014
00:40:55,692 --> 00:41:00,293
The new residents of Palace Week will enter.

1015
00:41:01,533 --> 00:41:03,263
I knew it!

1016
00:41:04,002 --> 00:41:06,702
- Gosh. - Who are they?

1017
00:41:06,703 --> 00:41:08,543
(The men are nervous about the new residents.)

1018
00:41:08,902 --> 00:41:10,942
- The female comes first. - That's right.

1019
00:41:12,442 --> 00:41:13,842
- Here she comes. - Here she comes.

1020
00:41:14,043 --> 00:41:15,043
Who is it?

1021
00:41:17,382 --> 00:41:19,382
Who is it?

1022
00:41:19,683 --> 00:41:23,152
(Who is the new female resident?)

1023
00:41:23,382 --> 00:41:25,652
The new residents will enter.

1024
00:41:28,022 --> 00:41:29,292
(Ha Soo Jin, a model-like interpreter at a global firm)

1025
00:41:29,293 --> 00:41:30,361
She's the one with a cat-like face.

1026
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:32,293
It's Ha Soo Jin, an interpreter and translator.

1027
00:41:32,493 --> 00:41:34,992
- She received 6 votes in Round 3. - Right.

1028
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:37,501
Hello.

1029
00:41:37,502 --> 00:41:39,002
Welcome!

1030
00:41:39,703 --> 00:41:40,878
(They all get up at her arrival.)

1031
00:41:40,902 --> 00:41:42,072
Oh, hey.

1032
00:41:42,572 --> 00:41:43,602
- No way. - Hello.

1033
00:41:43,603 --> 00:41:45,001
- Gosh. - Over here.

1034
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,473
You can sit over here. Please do.

1035
00:41:47,572 --> 00:41:48,842
May I sit here?

1036
00:41:49,982 --> 00:41:51,813
(Are you sitting with us?)

1037
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:54,552
Thank you.

1038
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:55,858
(She returns to the women's lounge.)

1039
00:41:55,882 --> 00:41:57,822
She's come to bring confusion.

1040
00:41:58,022 --> 00:41:59,152
I can still smell her.

1041
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:03,123
"Smell her?"

1042
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:05,563
(Ji Woong smells the cushion she sat on.)

1043
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:07,962
- What? - Come on!

1044
00:42:08,362 --> 00:42:10,402
What is he doing?

1045
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,973
- That was a little weird. - Was that weird? Okay.

1046
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:18,342
I didn't know you were like this.

1047
00:42:19,942 --> 00:42:21,742
Hi!

1048
00:42:21,743 --> 00:42:23,142
(The women also welcome Soo Jin.)

1049
00:42:23,143 --> 00:42:25,742
- Nice to see you. - Hello.

1050
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:28,012
- I knew you'd come. - Hi.

1051
00:42:28,013 --> 00:42:29,683
I thought you'd come.

1052
00:42:29,783 --> 00:42:31,083
Who are you going to pick?

1053
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,522
- Do I get to pick? - Yes, you do.

1054
00:42:34,322 --> 00:42:37,362
You're all so beautiful, though.

1055
00:42:37,893 --> 00:42:39,763
I thought really hard about it.

1056
00:42:41,393 --> 00:42:43,203
(Will you join me at Palace Week?)

1057
00:42:45,402 --> 00:42:47,902
(She ended up rejecting Male Number 9.)

1058
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:50,402
Who did you choose?

1059
00:42:50,502 --> 00:42:51,703
Number 24.

1060
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,643
(She chose Sang Gyeong.)

1061
00:42:53,743 --> 00:42:55,543
He's attractive,

1062
00:42:56,413 --> 00:42:57,612
and I'm interested.

1063
00:42:58,313 --> 00:42:59,813
Sang Gyeong is pretty popular.

1064
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:06,522
A new resident of Palace Week will enter.

1065
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:09,962
Who is it?

1066
00:43:10,293 --> 00:43:11,862
I hope it's another woman.

1067
00:43:13,232 --> 00:43:14,663
Maybe it's a guy this time.

1068
00:43:15,333 --> 00:43:16,833
I think it will be.

1069
00:43:18,933 --> 00:43:19,933
Who could it be?

1070
00:43:21,132 --> 00:43:23,043
Could it be the attorney from the US?

1071
00:43:23,203 --> 00:43:24,243
He's coming back?

1072
00:43:25,272 --> 00:43:27,413
(Who will be the second addition?)

1073
00:43:27,572 --> 00:43:29,143
Here he comes. It's a man.

1074
00:43:29,583 --> 00:43:31,913
The new resident will enter.

1075
00:43:34,683 --> 00:43:37,452
Oh, the corporate employee from Japan, Jae Keun!

1076
00:43:37,453 --> 00:43:38,723
He was popular.

1077
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:42,252
(The reason he decided to join Palace Week)

1078
00:43:42,493 --> 00:43:44,861
(The matching session for Palace Week in Round 3)

1079
00:43:44,862 --> 00:43:47,962
I'd like to call out Female Number 19.

1080
00:43:48,293 --> 00:43:51,603
(He chose Female Number 19 in Round 3.)

1081
00:43:52,002 --> 00:43:55,572
I was really drawn to Number 19.

1082
00:43:55,973 --> 00:43:56,973
Do I look kind?

1083
00:43:58,072 --> 00:44:00,243
You do look kind. Very much.

1084
00:44:02,313 --> 00:44:04,382
I believed that we had...

1085
00:44:05,043 --> 00:44:06,612
good feelings for each other.

1086
00:44:07,183 --> 00:44:08,982
I thought it'd go well.

1087
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:14,652
My heart fluttered the moment I saw you.

1088
00:44:16,922 --> 00:44:19,163
Follow me to the flower path.

1089
00:44:20,293 --> 00:44:24,663
(He mustered his courage to tell her how he felt.)

1090
00:44:28,033 --> 00:44:30,941
I don't think I'm ready yet.

1091
00:44:30,942 --> 00:44:32,002
I'm sorry.

1092
00:44:33,442 --> 00:44:35,742
(Sadly, the two weren't matched as she rejected him.)

1093
00:44:35,743 --> 00:44:38,583
She's not ready yet.

1094
00:44:44,022 --> 00:44:45,421
This is tough.

1095
00:44:45,422 --> 00:44:46,902
(Jae Keun was eliminated in Round 3.)

1096
00:44:48,092 --> 00:44:50,421
(That's how he joined Palace Week.)

1097
00:44:50,422 --> 00:44:53,862
I had something going on with Female Number Eight at first,

1098
00:44:53,962 --> 00:44:56,033
but she left with Male Number 28.

1099
00:44:56,533 --> 00:45:00,072
And Female Number 19, who I was certain about,

1100
00:45:00,402 --> 00:45:02,002
decided not to go. So, I was rejected.

1101
00:45:02,302 --> 00:45:05,071
That was how I came to realize that I wanted to talk more...

1102
00:45:05,072 --> 00:45:06,272
with others as well.

1103
00:45:07,973 --> 00:45:11,582
- Hi, everyone. - Hi!

1104
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:13,612
- Hello. - Oh, my gosh.

1105
00:45:14,652 --> 00:45:15,752
Hi!

1106
00:45:16,223 --> 00:45:17,482
Hi.

1107
00:45:17,922 --> 00:45:19,022
I came back from the dead.

1108
00:45:21,252 --> 00:45:23,462
You're not leaving for the couple zone yet, right?

1109
00:45:24,022 --> 00:45:25,922
When Number Three came,

1110
00:45:26,663 --> 00:45:32,603
I decided to follow my heart so that I wouldn't regret it.

1111
00:45:33,902 --> 00:45:36,442
I didn't expect Number Three to join us as a catfish,

1112
00:45:37,072 --> 00:45:38,172
but he did.

1113
00:45:38,873 --> 00:45:42,043
Before that, I was 100 percent sure about Male Number 24.

1114
00:45:42,612 --> 00:45:45,042
Then, Male Number Three came in as a catfish.

1115
00:45:45,043 --> 00:45:47,711
I thought, "What a quirk of fate."

1116
00:45:47,712 --> 00:45:49,353
"Why Number Three, of all men?"

1117
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:53,123
I hope to have a lot of conversations with you.

1118
00:45:53,422 --> 00:45:54,422
I'm so glad to see you all.

1119
00:45:54,423 --> 00:45:55,551
- Nice to see you. - See you around.

1120
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:56,639
(Jae Keun lets himself known to the women.)

1121
00:45:56,663 --> 00:45:59,022
They're all stunning.

1122
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:03,203
- Oh, no. - What's wrong?

1123
00:46:03,603 --> 00:46:04,603
I'm happy.

1124
00:46:08,603 --> 00:46:10,572
- This is getting competitive. - It is.

1125
00:46:11,243 --> 00:46:13,072
Jae Keun's eyes have changed.

1126
00:46:13,172 --> 00:46:14,473
I'm going all out now.

1127
00:46:16,612 --> 00:46:19,043
I don't have a partner. So, watch out.

1128
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:22,083
What if Female Number 19 comes?

1129
00:46:22,183 --> 00:46:23,382
She won't.

1130
00:46:24,922 --> 00:46:27,192
- A new resident will enter. - Another one?

1131
00:46:27,522 --> 00:46:28,751
Wait. What?

1132
00:46:28,752 --> 00:46:29,892
What's going on?

1133
00:46:29,893 --> 00:46:33,033
Do you think it's Female Number 19?

1134
00:46:34,163 --> 00:46:35,433
No way.

1135
00:46:36,533 --> 00:46:41,732
(The third new resident heads to Palace Week.)

1136
00:46:42,302 --> 00:46:43,643
Wait. Isn't that Number 19?

1137
00:46:43,743 --> 00:46:44,801
- It is. - It is.

1138
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,271
- It is. I think it's her. - What?

1139
00:46:46,272 --> 00:46:47,373
It's not.

1140
00:46:47,612 --> 00:46:49,043
I see her. It's a woman.

1141
00:46:49,143 --> 00:46:51,143
I see her.

1142
00:46:52,043 --> 00:46:53,313
- I think it's her. - What?

1143
00:46:53,712 --> 00:46:54,881
Is it her?

1144
00:46:54,882 --> 00:46:56,953
- No way. - His face is so funny.

1145
00:46:57,783 --> 00:47:00,293
(The third new resident)

1146
00:47:00,393 --> 00:47:01,521
(Yoo Hye Won)

1147
00:47:01,522 --> 00:47:03,663
What is Jae Keun going to do now?

1148
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:08,392
Hello.

1149
00:47:08,393 --> 00:47:10,033
- Hello. - Hello.

1150
00:47:13,132 --> 00:47:15,872
(We can't tell anything from Jae Keun's face.)

1151
00:47:15,873 --> 00:47:17,801
- You can come in. - Can I?

1152
00:47:17,802 --> 00:47:18,973
I see.

1153
00:47:20,013 --> 00:47:23,013
(The men read Jae Keun's face as she steps in.)

1154
00:47:25,013 --> 00:47:27,652
Hello.

1155
00:47:29,453 --> 00:47:30,783
I never imagined it.

1156
00:47:31,422 --> 00:47:32,683
At first, if I'm being honest,

1157
00:47:33,022 --> 00:47:35,822
I felt resentment and a tiny bit of anger.

1158
00:47:36,223 --> 00:47:39,123
But when I actually saw her, I was, in fact,

1159
00:47:40,063 --> 00:47:41,263
glad.

1160
00:47:41,732 --> 00:47:44,862
So, I'd like to have a chat with her for now.

1161
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:49,402
- Goodbye. - Bye.

1162
00:47:51,942 --> 00:47:55,313
(Why did she decide to join Palace Week?)

1163
00:47:55,612 --> 00:48:00,012
(The matching session for Palace Week in Round 3)

1164
00:48:00,013 --> 00:48:01,611
"We'll live happily ever after."

1165
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:04,382
When I saw those couples get matched,

1166
00:48:05,283 --> 00:48:06,592
I felt burdened.

1167
00:48:07,752 --> 00:48:11,163
Although I had good feelings for him,

1168
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:14,533
I wasn't brave enough.

1169
00:48:15,933 --> 00:48:17,253
When I saw him leave from behind,

1170
00:48:18,862 --> 00:48:19,933
I regretted it.

1171
00:48:21,672 --> 00:48:22,873
I thought, "This isn't right."

1172
00:48:25,203 --> 00:48:28,672
I realized too late that I might be missing...

1173
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:31,743
the opportunity to meet the right person.

1174
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:37,051
He had mustered up his courage to come to me,

1175
00:48:37,052 --> 00:48:40,092
but I wasn't able to show courage.

1176
00:48:40,592 --> 00:48:44,591
I should have accepted him in good faith,

1177
00:48:44,592 --> 00:48:47,062
but I guess I wasn't brave enough.

1178
00:48:47,063 --> 00:48:48,333
I regretted it.

1179
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:51,433
I might have let go of many good men...

1180
00:48:51,533 --> 00:48:54,433
due to this personality of mine.

1181
00:48:55,103 --> 00:48:57,772
(She bravely joined Palace Week so that she wouldn't regret it.)

1182
00:48:58,172 --> 00:49:01,472
(All 33 residents of Palace Week have entered.)

1183
00:49:01,473 --> 00:49:04,143
Please open your envelopes...

1184
00:49:04,643 --> 00:49:06,242
- What is it? - and check the content.

1185
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:07,481
What?

1186
00:49:07,482 --> 00:49:08,482
Take a look.

1187
00:49:09,152 --> 00:49:12,552
You can't open the envelope until you are instructed to do so.

1188
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:15,692
I was so curious about what was inside.

1189
00:49:17,422 --> 00:49:19,493
I was kind of afraid to open it.

1190
00:49:20,293 --> 00:49:22,692
I was like, "What is it? Could it be an invite to a date?"

1191
00:49:23,462 --> 00:49:25,103
I had no clue what it was.

1192
00:49:26,132 --> 00:49:27,132
"One."

1193
00:49:27,533 --> 00:49:29,272
- Same for me. "One." - I have "Two."

1194
00:49:29,842 --> 00:49:31,473
- Why does mine say, "Five?" - What?

1195
00:49:31,572 --> 00:49:32,973
It's a number?

1196
00:49:33,243 --> 00:49:35,211
- What's this? - What does it mean?

1197
00:49:35,212 --> 00:49:36,212
I wonder what it is.

1198
00:49:36,783 --> 00:49:37,882
Roommates?

1199
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:40,512
The number in the envelope...

1200
00:49:40,513 --> 00:49:43,421
(What does the number in the envelope mean?)

1201
00:49:43,422 --> 00:49:45,283
is the number of the residents...

1202
00:49:45,752 --> 00:49:47,091
who are interested in dating you...

1203
00:49:47,092 --> 00:49:51,362
other than the one that you were matched with.

1204
00:49:51,862 --> 00:49:53,091
Other than the one you were matched with,

1205
00:49:53,092 --> 00:49:54,191
- Exactly. - it's the number of people...

1206
00:49:54,192 --> 00:49:56,332
who want to go out with you.

1207
00:49:56,333 --> 00:49:57,801
But they don't know who picked them.

1208
00:49:57,802 --> 00:49:59,203
- No. - No.

1209
00:49:59,732 --> 00:50:02,502
Oh, it was a sad number.

1210
00:50:03,143 --> 00:50:05,172
You're quite popular.

1211
00:50:05,643 --> 00:50:07,612
Five? You have so many.

1212
00:50:08,143 --> 00:50:10,743
(Si Yeon got 5 votes, the highest number among women.)

1213
00:50:11,212 --> 00:50:12,282
(Sang Gyeong has the most votes among men.)

1214
00:50:12,283 --> 00:50:13,413
You're popular.

1215
00:50:15,083 --> 00:50:18,822
I realized that there were lots of women who wanted to talk.

1216
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:21,692
When I read the number three,

1217
00:50:22,422 --> 00:50:25,663
I considered coming to the single zone.

1218
00:50:26,462 --> 00:50:28,762
(Meanwhile, Ye Rin seems to have a lot on her mind.)

1219
00:50:28,763 --> 00:50:32,433
At first, I didn't even think it was a number.

1220
00:50:32,663 --> 00:50:34,132
I thought we got an O or an X.

1221
00:50:34,272 --> 00:50:35,473
But that wasn't the case.

1222
00:50:35,933 --> 00:50:39,102
It was the number zero, so I thought,

1223
00:50:39,103 --> 00:50:44,642
"Are there no men here who wants to get to know me?"

1224
00:50:44,643 --> 00:50:46,953
I did feel a bit dispirited.

1225
00:50:48,052 --> 00:50:49,282
But we wouldn't have to worry about getting eliminated...

1226
00:50:49,283 --> 00:50:50,822
now that we've come this far.

1227
00:50:51,083 --> 00:50:52,582
- I heard you could give up. - You can give up.

1228
00:50:52,583 --> 00:50:54,021
It's a voluntary decision.

1229
00:50:54,022 --> 00:50:57,492
I reckon it's better to talk to the residents...

1230
00:50:57,493 --> 00:50:59,092
who you want to get to know.

1231
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:01,183
You're free to stir up trouble while you're here.

1232
00:51:02,833 --> 00:51:03,901
It's the beginning of war.

1233
00:51:03,902 --> 00:51:06,102
I'm going to be a jerk.

1234
00:51:06,103 --> 00:51:07,972
(Ji Woong expects to meet new women.)

1235
00:51:07,973 --> 00:51:09,733
How did you find him when you talked to him?

1236
00:51:09,802 --> 00:51:11,302
- I liked him. - Really?

1237
00:51:11,473 --> 00:51:13,913
- Do you think you're compatible? - Are you totally into him?

1238
00:51:14,313 --> 00:51:15,872
(Na Kyung carefully listens to the talk about Ji Woong.)

1239
00:51:15,873 --> 00:51:17,441
In Round Three,

1240
00:51:17,442 --> 00:51:21,313
I talked to Male Number 11 after getting his profile card.

1241
00:51:21,683 --> 00:51:23,151
I like tall women.

1242
00:51:23,152 --> 00:51:24,152
(She's 173cm tall.)

1243
00:51:24,153 --> 00:51:25,753
What does it mean to dress like a woman?

1244
00:51:26,052 --> 00:51:28,352
Like you're dressed now.

1245
00:51:28,353 --> 00:51:29,422
- Is that right? - Yes.

1246
00:51:29,692 --> 00:51:32,192
- Have you made up your mind? - Not yet.

1247
00:51:33,393 --> 00:51:34,762
We had a good chat,

1248
00:51:34,763 --> 00:51:36,533
and he said a lot of positive things.

1249
00:51:36,833 --> 00:51:38,632
I wasn't considering it,

1250
00:51:39,033 --> 00:51:40,632
but I wanted to talk to him more.

1251
00:51:41,373 --> 00:51:43,442
That way, I won't regret it.

1252
00:51:49,643 --> 00:51:50,682
You will now choose...

1253
00:51:50,683 --> 00:51:53,652
between the couple zone and the single zone.

1254
00:51:54,813 --> 00:51:56,783
This is too soon. I need to think.

1255
00:51:57,482 --> 00:51:58,881
I'm so torn.

1256
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:01,691
If I choose the single zone, will he come and get me?

1257
00:52:01,692 --> 00:52:03,123
For you, maybe.

1258
00:52:03,723 --> 00:52:06,163
If you want to choose the couple zone now,

1259
00:52:06,763 --> 00:52:09,492
please move to the couple zone.

1260
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:10,763
I wonder how many will go.

1261
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,772
- A lot of them are going! - That's a lot.

1262
00:52:15,002 --> 00:52:16,743
- You too? - You're going?

1263
00:52:17,143 --> 00:52:18,502
It's so unpredictable.

1264
00:52:18,743 --> 00:52:21,742
Next, the women will move.

1265
00:52:21,743 --> 00:52:22,772
It's our turn.

1266
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:24,313
Are you all going?

1267
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:25,812
Bye.

1268
00:52:25,813 --> 00:52:27,913
- See you later. - Be happy.

1269
00:52:28,183 --> 00:52:29,953
So many of them left.

1270
00:52:31,552 --> 00:52:33,691
You either choose the matching partner...

1271
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:35,092
who came to Palace Week with you...

1272
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:37,822
or decide to meet more residents.

1273
00:52:40,163 --> 00:52:41,691
(Oh Sang Joon chooses the couple zone.)

1274
00:52:41,692 --> 00:52:43,163
It's him.

1275
00:52:43,502 --> 00:52:45,232
He was born in 1979. He's older than me.

1276
00:52:46,063 --> 00:52:47,703
I chose the couple zone.

1277
00:52:48,302 --> 00:52:50,042
I came here because I wanted to spend more time...

1278
00:52:50,043 --> 00:52:51,941
with Female Number Nine.

1279
00:52:51,942 --> 00:52:53,002
(Imagining happy things)

1280
00:52:53,612 --> 00:52:55,841
(Who followed him to the couple zone?)

1281
00:52:55,842 --> 00:52:56,912
(Choi Jae Yeon chose the couple zone.)

1282
00:52:56,913 --> 00:52:58,111
Couple zone.

1283
00:52:58,112 --> 00:53:00,111
He's very straightforward.

1284
00:53:00,112 --> 00:53:01,512
- I knew he'd come here. - Yes.

1285
00:53:01,513 --> 00:53:03,159
(Choi Jae Yeon, the innocent oral surgeon)

1286
00:53:03,183 --> 00:53:04,882
It wasn't a tough decision.

1287
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:07,752
How long will I have to wait?

1288
00:53:10,123 --> 00:53:11,792
(A woman walks down the hall.)

1289
00:53:11,793 --> 00:53:12,993
Here she comes.

1290
00:53:15,893 --> 00:53:17,062
Is it Joo Hee?

1291
00:53:17,063 --> 00:53:18,763
(Will it be her?)

1292
00:53:19,933 --> 00:53:21,933
I have a feeling that it's Female Number 18.

1293
00:53:24,043 --> 00:53:26,373
(Is it Number 18?)

1294
00:53:26,772 --> 00:53:27,941
(Female Number 18, Joo Hee)

1295
00:53:27,942 --> 00:53:28,973
Who is it?

1296
00:53:32,313 --> 00:53:33,353
Oh, it isn't her.

1297
00:53:34,513 --> 00:53:35,582
It's Jin Ju.

1298
00:53:35,583 --> 00:53:37,159
(Another resident who chose the couple zone)

1299
00:53:37,183 --> 00:53:38,522
Oh, the names are up.

1300
00:53:40,252 --> 00:53:42,152
I bet he chose the couple zone.

1301
00:53:42,922 --> 00:53:46,021
We had a chat when we first arrived.

1302
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:48,793
And he said, "See you soon."

1303
00:53:49,793 --> 00:53:51,232
- Bye, then. - I'll see you soon.

1304
00:53:51,333 --> 00:53:52,832
- Yes. - See you soon.

1305
00:53:52,833 --> 00:53:54,913
(The last thing he said to her was, "See you soon.")

1306
00:53:55,072 --> 00:53:56,533
I believe he picked me.

1307
00:53:58,302 --> 00:53:59,302
(Knocking)

1308
00:54:00,973 --> 00:54:02,112
He's here.

1309
00:54:02,473 --> 00:54:03,481
Yes?

1310
00:54:03,482 --> 00:54:05,522
(Jin Ju walks to the door with a fluttering heart.)

1311
00:54:05,643 --> 00:54:07,111
- Sang Gyeong. - Has he come?

1312
00:54:07,112 --> 00:54:10,822
(Has he come for her?)

1313
00:54:11,152 --> 00:54:14,853
(There's an announcement in the single zone.)

1314
00:54:15,422 --> 00:54:17,362
The residents who have chosen the single zone...

1315
00:54:17,993 --> 00:54:22,433
will come to the communal lounge and meet each other.

1316
00:54:24,163 --> 00:54:28,232
(Which residents chose the single zone?)

1317
00:54:29,103 --> 00:54:30,401
(Lee Sang Gyeong chose the single zone.)

1318
00:54:30,402 --> 00:54:31,873
Sang Gyeong is here!

1319
00:54:32,302 --> 00:54:33,973
I chose the single zone.

1320
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:37,442
The number was six when I opened the envelope.

1321
00:54:38,712 --> 00:54:42,413
I realized that there were lots of women who wanted to talk.

1322
00:54:43,522 --> 00:54:46,182
- They all look so fancy. - Your outfits are...

1323
00:54:46,183 --> 00:54:47,192
Nice to see you.

1324
00:54:47,623 --> 00:54:49,592
I chose the single zone.

1325
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:52,293
The biggest reason was the entrance of Male Number Three.

1326
00:54:52,723 --> 00:54:56,493
I guess I want to go where my heart leads me to.

1327
00:54:57,462 --> 00:54:58,933
Poor Sang Joon.

1328
00:54:59,933 --> 00:55:00,933
- Oh, my. - Oh, my.

1329
00:55:00,934 --> 00:55:02,032
The museum curator, Ye Rin,

1330
00:55:02,033 --> 00:55:03,901
has also come to the single zone.

1331
00:55:03,902 --> 00:55:04,972
Right.

1332
00:55:04,973 --> 00:55:06,373
- Why are there so many? - No way!

1333
00:55:06,712 --> 00:55:08,611
(The women walk into the communal lounge.)

1334
00:55:08,612 --> 00:55:09,743
How come there are so many?

1335
00:55:09,842 --> 00:55:11,211
One, two, three...

1336
00:55:11,212 --> 00:55:12,882
One, two, three, four, five...

1337
00:55:13,413 --> 00:55:15,452
Are there more women than men?

1338
00:55:15,453 --> 00:55:16,611
They all went upstairs.

1339
00:55:16,612 --> 00:55:17,822
- Did they? - Yes.

1340
00:55:18,123 --> 00:55:21,552
(In the meantime, Jae Yeon still waits for Joo Hee.)

1341
00:55:23,152 --> 00:55:24,223
He's so cute.

1342
00:55:25,793 --> 00:55:26,862
Hang on.

1343
00:55:27,333 --> 00:55:28,862
(They're shocked to see someone.)

1344
00:55:30,232 --> 00:55:31,401
(Bae Joo Hee chose the single zone.)

1345
00:55:31,402 --> 00:55:33,082
(Pharmacist who wants to be the best wife)

1346
00:55:33,362 --> 00:55:34,571
Why did you do that?

1347
00:55:34,572 --> 00:55:36,103
You two were looking strong!

1348
00:55:36,572 --> 00:55:38,402
Women are so fickle.

1349
00:55:39,442 --> 00:55:41,342
I chose the single zone.

1350
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:44,643
The couple zone felt like too much.

1351
00:55:44,813 --> 00:55:47,312
But there's no pressure in the single zone.

1352
00:55:47,313 --> 00:55:50,522
So, I decided to stay in the single zone.

1353
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:54,051
(But Jae Yeon has no idea about this.)

1354
00:55:54,052 --> 00:55:55,222
Poor Jae Yeon.

1355
00:55:55,223 --> 00:55:57,321
(He's still waiting for her.)

1356
00:55:57,322 --> 00:55:59,021
That's...

1357
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,631
Are there more women than men?

1358
00:56:00,632 --> 00:56:02,592
(Oh Sin Da chose the single zone.)

1359
00:56:03,703 --> 00:56:04,732
What?

1360
00:56:04,802 --> 00:56:07,473
He ran into Sin Da.

1361
00:56:08,873 --> 00:56:11,572
Although I chose the single zone,

1362
00:56:12,203 --> 00:56:13,203
I didn't expect to see him there.

1363
00:56:13,204 --> 00:56:15,572
I got pretty angry when I saw him there.

1364
00:56:17,882 --> 00:56:21,083
(She understands, but she's seething inside.)

1365
00:56:21,453 --> 00:56:23,251
Why didn't you go to the couple zone?

1366
00:56:23,252 --> 00:56:24,552
You didn't give me a conviction.

1367
00:56:25,022 --> 00:56:27,692
To be honest, I'm glad that you didn't.

1368
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,992
(He's surprised by her sudden honesty.)

1369
00:56:31,993 --> 00:56:33,692
I did meet her a few times,

1370
00:56:34,192 --> 00:56:35,933
but all we did was talk.

1371
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:39,162
There was some pressure to go to the couple zone...

1372
00:56:39,163 --> 00:56:41,802
and talk about marriage with only that.

1373
00:56:44,172 --> 00:56:45,172
Yes?

1374
00:56:47,672 --> 00:56:50,813
(The couple breaking cards have been delivered.)

1375
00:56:51,313 --> 00:56:53,882
"Your partner has decided not to be a couple."

1376
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:57,453
"Will you find new love in the single zone?"

1377
00:56:58,223 --> 00:57:01,092
"Or will you leave the Couple Palace?"

1378
00:57:03,692 --> 00:57:05,822
I knew it.

1379
00:57:06,833 --> 00:57:09,362
There was one thing that bothered me.

1380
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:13,333
I saw how excited she was about coming here,

1381
00:57:13,572 --> 00:57:16,902
and I realized that she wasn't excited about spending time with me.

1382
00:57:18,043 --> 00:57:19,501
(What's his decision?)

1383
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:20,543
Will he leave?

1384
00:57:21,973 --> 00:57:23,542
(The single zone)

1385
00:57:23,543 --> 00:57:24,912
- Come over here. - Sit with us.

1386
00:57:24,913 --> 00:57:26,542
- Come here. - Take a seat.

1387
00:57:26,543 --> 00:57:28,663
(Joo Hee mingles with others in the communal lounge.)

1388
00:57:28,783 --> 00:57:31,453
What's your story...

1389
00:57:31,922 --> 00:57:33,952
behind bailing on Number Seven?

1390
00:57:33,953 --> 00:57:36,293
I didn't bail on him.

1391
00:57:36,493 --> 00:57:41,132
(Jae Yeon is deep in thought in the couple zone by himself.)

1392
00:57:41,732 --> 00:57:43,563
Male Number Seven and I are the closest.

1393
00:57:43,703 --> 00:57:46,763
It's not Male Number Seven's fault.

1394
00:57:47,772 --> 00:57:49,771
I had a brief date...

1395
00:57:49,772 --> 00:57:52,143
with Female Number 18, the pharmacist,

1396
00:57:52,172 --> 00:57:53,571
in Round Three,

1397
00:57:53,572 --> 00:57:56,313
and it was memorable as we had so much fun.

1398
00:57:57,583 --> 00:57:59,981
When we talked last time,

1399
00:57:59,982 --> 00:58:01,712
it was so fun.

1400
00:58:01,913 --> 00:58:06,622
I thought you were funny, though.

1401
00:58:06,623 --> 00:58:08,922
This whole week,

1402
00:58:09,252 --> 00:58:11,663
"I just get thirsty..."

1403
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:14,732
kept lingering in my ears.

1404
00:58:14,933 --> 00:58:17,301
Even with water, I have to buy the 500ml bottled ones.

1405
00:58:17,302 --> 00:58:20,002
I just get thirsty.

1406
00:58:20,933 --> 00:58:22,072
I get thirsty.

1407
00:58:22,272 --> 00:58:25,441
(They were laughing at the slightest things.)

1408
00:58:25,442 --> 00:58:27,571
I kept giggling...

1409
00:58:27,572 --> 00:58:29,712
while I was packing medicine.

1410
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:31,942
- Stay here for a while. - Sure.

1411
00:58:32,913 --> 00:58:35,652
The seat is too soft.

1412
00:58:35,813 --> 00:58:37,881
(He naturally sits next to Joo Hee.)

1413
00:58:37,882 --> 00:58:41,293
I'm actually worried about microplastics these days.

1414
00:58:41,993 --> 00:58:43,961
I'm a bit worried.

1415
00:58:43,962 --> 00:58:45,469
(Joo Hee bursts into laughter at what he says.)

1416
00:58:45,493 --> 00:58:48,533
(In their own world)

1417
00:58:48,862 --> 00:58:50,932
(What's so funny?)

1418
00:58:50,933 --> 00:58:52,402
Oh, my gosh. It's so funny.

1419
00:58:53,433 --> 00:58:55,103
What's so funny over there?

1420
00:58:55,672 --> 00:58:57,242
Everything he says is funny.

1421
00:58:57,243 --> 00:58:59,441
I heard a rumor...

1422
00:58:59,442 --> 00:59:01,111
that you were hilarious.

1423
00:59:01,112 --> 00:59:02,312
- Right? - You heard it, right?

1424
00:59:02,313 --> 00:59:03,711
Someone told me.

1425
00:59:03,712 --> 00:59:05,342
- It was probably me. - Was it?

1426
00:59:05,482 --> 00:59:07,083
I've been telling everyone.

1427
00:59:08,413 --> 00:59:10,953
Number 24, the dermatologist.

1428
00:59:11,683 --> 00:59:13,993
Everything he says is funny.

1429
00:59:14,353 --> 00:59:15,722
- Oh, my gosh. - Who?

1430
00:59:15,723 --> 00:59:16,893
- Who? - Number 24.

1431
00:59:17,663 --> 00:59:19,792
(She was the source of the rumor about Sang Gyeong.)

1432
00:59:19,793 --> 00:59:21,091
Did you finish your military service?

1433
00:59:21,092 --> 00:59:22,092
Of course, I did.

1434
00:59:22,092 --> 00:59:23,092
- Seriously? - Yes.

1435
00:59:23,093 --> 00:59:24,202
But Male Number Seven didn't.

1436
00:59:24,203 --> 00:59:25,732
Right. But I did.

1437
00:59:26,203 --> 00:59:27,402
Which branch?

1438
00:59:27,603 --> 00:59:28,631
As an army surgeon.

1439
00:59:28,632 --> 00:59:29,731
- An army surgeon? - Yes.

1440
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:31,452
(While Sang Gyeong and Joo Hee are talking)

1441
00:59:31,703 --> 00:59:33,143
Oh, no. Is that Jae Yeon?

1442
00:59:37,612 --> 00:59:39,183
- Oh, my goodness. - He's here.

1443
00:59:39,513 --> 00:59:40,852
- Hey. - Hi.

1444
00:59:40,853 --> 00:59:42,751
- Jae Yeon! - Jae Yeon is here.

1445
00:59:42,752 --> 00:59:44,722
- Hi. - Hi.

1446
00:59:44,723 --> 00:59:45,822
Welcome.

1447
00:59:46,683 --> 00:59:48,051
Is this something we should clap for?

1448
00:59:48,052 --> 00:59:49,269
(Joo Hee hurries over to Jae Yeon.)

1449
00:59:49,293 --> 00:59:50,362
Come here.

1450
00:59:51,993 --> 00:59:53,262
Time for an explanation.

1451
00:59:53,263 --> 00:59:54,932
- Time for an explanation? - Time for an explanation.

1452
00:59:54,933 --> 00:59:56,162
Can I explain to him instead?

1453
00:59:56,163 --> 00:59:57,501
(Joo Hee spends time alone with Jae Yeon.)

1454
00:59:57,502 --> 00:59:59,002
- Hear me out. - Okay?

1455
00:59:59,132 --> 01:00:02,271
I didn't have a problem with you.

1456
01:00:02,272 --> 01:00:05,802
It felt so burdensome to go to the couple zone.

1457
01:00:06,002 --> 01:00:08,413
I kind of expected it.

1458
01:00:10,583 --> 01:00:12,282
When I went there,

1459
01:00:12,283 --> 01:00:14,123
I was stuck in a room for two hours all alone.

1460
01:00:14,353 --> 01:00:15,611
- Oh, no. - I drank water...

1461
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:17,452
and just walked around by myself.

1462
01:00:17,453 --> 01:00:18,882
It was really...

1463
01:00:19,453 --> 01:00:21,591
And they gave me this after ringing the doorbell.

1464
01:00:21,592 --> 01:00:22,592
Yes?

1465
01:00:24,293 --> 01:00:26,362
- Oh, come on. - It said that you broke it off.

1466
01:00:26,993 --> 01:00:28,392
- When I read it, - But...

1467
01:00:28,393 --> 01:00:30,263
I was like, "She broke it off?"

1468
01:00:31,203 --> 01:00:34,572
But that wasn't how I really felt.

1469
01:00:34,672 --> 01:00:39,301
I just need your assurance.

1470
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:40,342
- Really? - Yes.

1471
01:00:40,672 --> 01:00:42,413
You don't need to feel terrible about it.

1472
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:45,742
- But it was for two hours. - Two hours was tough.

1473
01:00:45,743 --> 01:00:47,252
Aren't you complaining right now?

1474
01:00:48,013 --> 01:00:49,583
Well, it wasn't easy.

1475
01:00:49,982 --> 01:00:52,082
I should complain, shouldn't I? For two hours, I...

1476
01:00:52,083 --> 01:00:53,803
That is indeed something to complain about.

1477
01:00:54,152 --> 01:00:55,591
Jae Yeon is very calm...

1478
01:00:55,592 --> 01:00:57,422
not making a big deal out of this.

1479
01:00:57,563 --> 01:00:59,222
He said she didn't need to feel terrible.

1480
01:00:59,223 --> 01:01:00,562
He's a man's man.

1481
01:01:00,563 --> 01:01:01,663
- He's cool. - Right?

1482
01:01:02,493 --> 01:01:05,202
- I've explained myself. - Are you done?

1483
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:06,502
You're done explaining, right?

1484
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:08,333
It was really tough back there.

1485
01:01:10,942 --> 01:01:13,542
You should get ready to go to that seat over there.

1486
01:01:13,543 --> 01:01:15,671
I'm starting to get scared.

1487
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,283
- It's her, right? - Yes.

1488
01:01:18,482 --> 01:01:19,882
Is she here?

1489
01:01:20,083 --> 01:01:21,611
- She's here. - Already?

1490
01:01:21,612 --> 01:01:23,312
- Hold on. - Jae Yeon.

1491
01:01:23,313 --> 01:01:24,982
(She's here!)

1492
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:26,551
Hi.

1493
01:01:26,552 --> 01:01:27,992
(Jin Ju has chosen the single zone.)

1494
01:01:27,993 --> 01:01:29,553
You have to go to the explanation zone.

1495
01:01:29,723 --> 01:01:31,422
You have to go to the explanation zone.

1496
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:34,992
My head is a total mess.

1497
01:01:34,993 --> 01:01:37,762
It could've made her upset.

1498
01:01:37,763 --> 01:01:40,263
I was scared, thinking something might happen.

1499
01:01:41,402 --> 01:01:43,872
(She approaches with a smile.)

1500
01:01:43,873 --> 01:01:44,873
Hi.

1501
01:01:44,874 --> 01:01:46,473
It was so cold.

1502
01:01:47,413 --> 01:01:48,612
I'm starving.

1503
01:01:50,543 --> 01:01:51,842
She was in a good mood.

1504
01:01:51,942 --> 01:01:53,381
I felt relieved.

1505
01:01:53,382 --> 01:01:54,453
Have some water.

1506
01:01:55,052 --> 01:01:56,083
Thank you.

1507
01:01:56,252 --> 01:01:58,853
(The seniors of the explanation time watch the two.)

1508
01:01:58,953 --> 01:02:00,492
They're hilarious.

1509
01:02:00,493 --> 01:02:01,552
Why are you sitting here?

1510
01:02:03,252 --> 01:02:06,492
(Jin Ju loosens up the mood with her brightness.)

1511
01:02:06,493 --> 01:02:09,232
Why did you say, "See you soon?"

1512
01:02:09,333 --> 01:02:11,773
- He said, "See you soon." - See you soon at the single zone.

1513
01:02:12,862 --> 01:02:13,873
I...

1514
01:02:15,033 --> 01:02:16,332
didn't like how it was written.

1515
01:02:16,333 --> 01:02:18,742
We had to choose, right? But...

1516
01:02:18,743 --> 01:02:20,872
Same here. I was in a dilemma, too.

1517
01:02:20,873 --> 01:02:22,611
You're the careful type so you'd talk with more people.

1518
01:02:22,612 --> 01:02:24,912
I imagined you'd go to the single zone,

1519
01:02:24,913 --> 01:02:26,542
so I was thinking of going there, too.

1520
01:02:26,543 --> 01:02:28,882
"See you soon" was what made me go to the couple zone.

1521
01:02:29,813 --> 01:02:32,283
(The Time of Verification: See you soon.)

1522
01:02:32,382 --> 01:02:34,542
(Jin Ju took that as a sign to go to the couple zone.)

1523
01:02:34,592 --> 01:02:37,392
- That phrase. "See you soon." - Yes. "See you soon."

1524
01:02:37,393 --> 01:02:38,993
See you soon at the single zone.

1525
01:02:39,592 --> 01:02:41,862
Had he not said that I wouldn't have gone there.

1526
01:02:42,333 --> 01:02:43,731
I'm not emotionally hurt by it.

1527
01:02:43,732 --> 01:02:46,302
But he said, "See you soon."

1528
01:02:46,462 --> 01:02:47,933
I wonder why he said that.

1529
01:02:48,132 --> 01:02:49,171
Are you full?

1530
01:02:49,172 --> 01:02:52,543
(This man is still hung up on the couple breaking.)

1531
01:02:52,743 --> 01:02:54,271
I couldn't eat much.

1532
01:02:54,272 --> 01:02:56,211
- Really? You couldn't eat, right? - Yes, I felt bad.

1533
01:02:56,212 --> 01:02:57,212
No, I couldn't.

1534
01:02:59,813 --> 01:03:01,551
- Do you hold grudges? - No, I don't.

1535
01:03:01,552 --> 01:03:03,381
- You don't? - I don't.

1536
01:03:03,382 --> 01:03:05,582
But if we were to date for over ten years,

1537
01:03:05,583 --> 01:03:07,723
I would bring it up once after ten years.

1538
01:03:09,422 --> 01:03:10,921
It seems you hold long grudges.

1539
01:03:10,922 --> 01:03:12,562
But I don't make it obvious.

1540
01:03:12,563 --> 01:03:14,063
You made it obvious just now.

1541
01:03:14,563 --> 01:03:15,632
Like so obvious.

1542
01:03:16,563 --> 01:03:17,603
I'm sure he must be upset.

1543
01:03:19,333 --> 01:03:21,533
If I were him, I'd be upset. I'd sulk.

1544
01:03:23,502 --> 01:03:26,703
(After the time of explanation)

1545
01:03:27,413 --> 01:03:29,313
Those who have chosen...

1546
01:03:29,543 --> 01:03:32,012
the single zone must find a new partner.

1547
01:03:32,013 --> 01:03:33,312
(They must find a new partner.)

1548
01:03:33,313 --> 01:03:37,012
We will start the favorability vote...

1549
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:39,152
to choose a new person of interest in your heart.

1550
01:03:40,522 --> 01:03:42,421
Choose one of the opposite gender...

1551
01:03:42,422 --> 01:03:45,461
aside from your previous matching partner.

1552
01:03:45,462 --> 01:03:46,462
(Voting for a new partner)

1553
01:03:46,463 --> 01:03:49,393
This result will be reflected in your date.

1554
01:03:51,462 --> 01:03:52,462
Until the wedding,

1555
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:54,703
there is no yours and mine.

1556
01:03:54,833 --> 01:03:56,332
- "Yours and mine?" - It never existed.

1557
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:57,772
- It never existed. - No.

1558
01:03:57,902 --> 01:03:59,442
This place will turn into a jungle.

1559
01:04:01,473 --> 01:04:04,783
The prelude of our single zone has finally started.

1560
01:04:05,543 --> 01:04:06,712
My head hurts.

1561
01:04:08,183 --> 01:04:11,751
Many new relationships will start here.

1562
01:04:11,752 --> 01:04:13,099
(Will they survive in the jungle?)

1563
01:04:13,123 --> 01:04:15,552
(Women's lounge)

1564
01:04:17,793 --> 01:04:21,192
Today, the women's choices will be revealed.

1565
01:04:21,433 --> 01:04:22,492
- Okay. - "Revealed?"

1566
01:04:22,493 --> 01:04:25,763
Deliver your profile card to whom you chose in person.

1567
01:04:26,433 --> 01:04:28,372
- Why are you doing this to us? - Right?

1568
01:04:28,373 --> 01:04:31,202
The person called is to get up...

1569
01:04:31,203 --> 01:04:33,402
and directly deliver your profile card...

1570
01:04:33,672 --> 01:04:35,972
to the man you have just chosen.

1571
01:04:35,973 --> 01:04:38,013
Don't do this to us.

1572
01:04:38,313 --> 01:04:39,743
Female Number 18.

1573
01:04:40,313 --> 01:04:43,013
We will start the delivery with Bae Joo Hee.

1574
01:04:45,453 --> 01:04:47,793
(Joo Hee heads to the men's lounge.)

1575
01:04:48,453 --> 01:04:50,492
I chose him.

1576
01:04:50,493 --> 01:04:54,092
As I had many questions for him, I wanted to get to know him more.

1577
01:04:55,063 --> 01:04:56,832
- Hi. - Hi.

1578
01:04:56,833 --> 01:04:57,932
(Who does she want to get to know more?)

1579
01:04:57,933 --> 01:04:59,333
You've ended up coming first.

1580
01:04:59,603 --> 01:05:01,332
- You're right. - You must be nervous...

1581
01:05:01,333 --> 01:05:02,533
about being first.

1582
01:05:03,172 --> 01:05:04,771
Either way, she can't give it to me.

1583
01:05:04,772 --> 01:05:07,001
So I wondered...

1584
01:05:07,002 --> 01:05:08,643
who the guy would be.

1585
01:05:09,672 --> 01:05:12,341
It crossed my mind for a second that she might give it to me.

1586
01:05:12,342 --> 01:05:15,381
She said our conversation was very entertaining.

1587
01:05:15,382 --> 01:05:17,152
And it was the same for me.

1588
01:05:20,322 --> 01:05:24,022
(She heads to...)

1589
01:05:26,362 --> 01:05:29,933
(Sang Gyeong who shares similar humor codes.)

1590
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:47,751
Who do you have in mind?

1591
01:05:47,752 --> 01:05:48,812
Number 24.

1592
01:05:48,813 --> 01:05:49,881
(Women's lounge before the favorability vote)

1593
01:05:49,882 --> 01:05:52,083
- Really? - He's hilarious.

1594
01:05:54,522 --> 01:05:56,893
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

1595
01:05:58,123 --> 01:06:00,421
- When will the date be? Tomorrow? - Today.

1596
01:06:00,422 --> 01:06:02,162
It's slowly getting interesting.

1597
01:06:02,163 --> 01:06:03,163
I know, right?

1598
01:06:03,493 --> 01:06:04,502
I'm wide awake now.

1599
01:06:06,103 --> 01:06:07,832
I think your heart could waver.

1600
01:06:07,833 --> 01:06:09,071
- It can. - Of course.

1601
01:06:09,072 --> 01:06:10,942
- What now? - Seriously.

1602
01:06:12,143 --> 01:06:15,072
Since that moment, Palace Week has become a challenge.

1603
01:06:16,243 --> 01:06:18,482
I kept trying to be mentally at peace.

1604
01:06:21,083 --> 01:06:23,812
Those who will go on the marriage-focused date...

1605
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,152
will be called.

1606
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:29,591
Number 24, Lee Sang Gyeong.

1607
01:06:29,592 --> 01:06:30,712
(Number 24, Lee Sang Gyeong)

1608
01:06:31,862 --> 01:06:33,192
His date could be Joo Hee.

1609
01:06:36,793 --> 01:06:41,703
(Sang Gyeong heads to the dating spot.)

1610
01:06:52,283 --> 01:06:54,513
I started feeling anxious.

1611
01:06:57,083 --> 01:07:00,122
(Jae Yeon's anxiety...)

1612
01:07:00,123 --> 01:07:03,392
(has become a reality.)

1613
01:07:03,393 --> 01:07:04,421
Hi.

1614
01:07:04,422 --> 01:07:05,961
(Male Number 24 and Female Number 18 are matched.)

1615
01:07:05,962 --> 01:07:07,493
My worries...

1616
01:07:08,732 --> 01:07:09,993
were gradually growing.

1617
01:07:14,103 --> 01:07:16,432
(At the men's lounge)

1618
01:07:16,433 --> 01:07:19,272
I think I should bring it up.

1619
01:07:19,603 --> 01:07:20,643
What is it?

1620
01:07:21,612 --> 01:07:23,772
Looking closely at Number 19...

1621
01:07:24,243 --> 01:07:25,312
Number 19?

1622
01:07:25,313 --> 01:07:26,482
- Yes. - Do you know her?

1623
01:07:28,652 --> 01:07:31,353
No. In the past... Do none of you know her?

1624
01:07:31,583 --> 01:07:32,752
Who is she?

1625
01:07:33,052 --> 01:07:34,493
- I don't know. - You don't?

1626
01:07:35,422 --> 01:07:36,993
She's a very famous person.

1627
01:07:38,022 --> 01:07:39,362
Rumors about her aren't great.

1628
01:07:39,422 --> 01:07:40,493
Really?

1629
01:07:40,862 --> 01:07:42,333
- For real? - Yes.

1630
01:07:43,132 --> 01:07:45,833
There were two different articles about her.

1631
01:07:45,902 --> 01:07:47,033
About what?

1632
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:50,232
- She's famous? - Is she super famous?

1633
01:07:51,072 --> 01:07:53,272
(Entering the long-awaited couple zone)

1634
01:07:53,373 --> 01:07:54,889
(Preparing for the wedding in full swing?)

1635
01:07:54,913 --> 01:07:58,283
(Just looking at their partner makes them smile.)

1636
01:07:58,442 --> 01:07:59,682
(You look dazzling and pretty!)

1637
01:07:59,942 --> 01:08:01,612
(A happiness-filled couple zone)

1638
01:08:01,813 --> 01:08:04,112
(I will drag him down from the couple zone.)

1639
01:08:04,353 --> 01:08:06,683
(Okay! I will make him come down.)

1640
01:08:06,853 --> 01:08:09,192
(I will drag him down.)

1641
01:08:10,393 --> 01:08:13,322
(Nobody can put their guard down!)

1642
01:08:14,862 --> 01:08:16,462
(You're bound to come to me.)

1643
01:08:16,463 --> 01:08:17,632
(I will take him from her.)

1644
01:08:17,633 --> 01:08:19,101
(She's quite my ideal type.)

1645
01:08:19,102 --> 01:08:20,663
(Why does it feel like cheating?)

1646
01:08:20,762 --> 01:08:22,372
(The single zone of stealing and getting stolen?)

1647
01:08:22,373 --> 01:08:24,071
(I'm feeling competitive.)

1648
01:08:24,072 --> 01:08:25,378
(What'll happen to their dangerous relationship?)

1649
01:08:25,402 --> 01:08:27,743
(I missed you.)

1650
01:08:27,843 --> 01:08:29,472
(Same here.)

1651
01:08:30,173 --> 01:08:32,883
(An intimate and bewitching secret date will begin?)

1652
01:08:33,413 --> 01:08:37,212
(As if a rope stretches and then snaps, )

1653
01:08:37,213 --> 01:08:39,382
(there will come a moment when I'll snap.)

1654
01:08:39,383 --> 01:08:41,691
(All the people in the single zone...)

1655
01:08:41,692 --> 01:08:43,423
(are hyenas.)

1656
01:08:43,522 --> 01:08:48,153
(What happened on the first night at Palace Week?)
