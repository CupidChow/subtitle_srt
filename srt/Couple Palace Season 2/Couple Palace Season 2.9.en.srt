1
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,880
(COUPLE PALACE 2)

2
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,919
People I know are going crazy lately.

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,159
It's so hot.

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,889
COUPLE PALACE is growing more and more fans.

5
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,859
- Yes. - It's worth it every time.

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,959
- What's it like for you? - Because I can't spoil it,

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,559
I just said one thing.

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,170
- What? - That it's a mess.

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,799
Every time I watch it, it drives me crazy...

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,409
- because of the love triangles. - Yes.

11
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:36,039
Last week, Joo Hee said she'd focus on Jae Yeon...

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,840
- during the breakfast date. - Yes.

13
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,479
I think I've made up my mind.

14
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,010
- Really? - Yes.

15
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,950
Jae Yeon was supposed to finally be happy.

16
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,790
But in just a few hours...

17
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,660
She went outside with Sang Gyeong for a date.

18
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,630
That date could become a big variable.

19
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,429
We have to talk about the love triangle...

20
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,970
between Sang Gyeong, Jin Ju, and Jae Keun.

21
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,599
I wish I could just say...

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,139
that I could do another business in Korea,

23
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,440
but I'm not in that situation.

24
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,040
They ran into some realistic issues.

25
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,039
I'm actually most looking forward to...

26
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,209
- Jung Won and Sin Da. - Right.

27
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,120
Just a day after moving to the couple zone...

28
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,779
Stay here. I'll come back.

29
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,389
That was the best phrase.

30
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,560
That was like a drama.

31
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,460
I'm moving to the single zone.

32
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,890
Will Ji Woong move to the single zone?

33
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,399
He already set one foot outside...

34
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,030
- to leave. - Yes.

35
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,269
(Morning in the couple zone)

36
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,270
It's the third morning in the couple zone.

37
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,470
Good morning.

38
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,939
(The breakfast date in the couple zone)

39
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,980
It's Yeong Seok and Soo Min who were going strong.

40
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,750
Hello.

41
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,680
I don't remember what happened yesterday.

42
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,220
It's crazy.

43
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,950
I don't remember anything.

44
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,459
I got so drunk yesterday.

45
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,090
You weren't just drunk.

46
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,790
Really?

47
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,359
What am I going to do?

48
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,360
(Yeong Seok doesn't look so happy.)

49
00:02:04,361 --> 00:02:06,129
What's wrong? They were good before.

50
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,130
(What happened to Yeong Seok and Soo Min?)

51
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,270
(Yeong Seok and Soo Min joined the party in the couple zone.)

52
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,139
We might attend their wedding...

53
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,540
in a year or two.

54
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,540
They have a high chance.

55
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,610
I made a mistake today.

56
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,310
I'm sorry.

57
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,379
Oh, what?

58
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,380
It's okay.

59
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,050
Soo Min felt really bad.

60
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,749
Han Sae said he knew someone...

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,890
from Soo Min's major,

62
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,230
and she said he was her ex.

63
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,630
I heard that.

64
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,429
What class are you? We went to the same university.

65
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,829
- The global leader major? - Yes.

66
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,639
- I'm the class of '16. - Me too.

67
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,640
Come closer.

68
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,669
That's my ex-boyfriend.

69
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,670
Seriously?

70
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:50,840
(Soo Min talked about her ex-boyfriend to Han Sae.)

71
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,310
So she had a college sweetheart.

72
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,010
She talked about her ex-boyfriend.

73
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,179
This is a big deal.

74
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,579
She kept talking about it in front of Yeong Seok...

75
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,249
- without hiding it. - Right.

76
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,690
The fact that she admitted it is impactful.

77
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,260
She kept drinking while apologizing.

78
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,159
(Soo Min overdrank while feeling sorry to Yeong Seok.)

79
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,830
Gosh, it doesn't seem like she can hold her liquor.

80
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,460
Are you okay?

81
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,230
Are you okay?

82
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,870
- Interview? - I'll be back after the interview.

83
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,269
Soo Min looks quite drunk.

84
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,739
(After getting tipsy, she got daring with physical affection.)

85
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,880
What are you doing?

86
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,679
They're getting quite close.

87
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,320
They even linked arms.

88
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,119
What? You aren't drunk, are you?

89
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,120
- I'm drunk. - Goodness.

90
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,989
I think this couple should go to their room.

91
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,959
- Come on, do it for me. - Like this?

92
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,259
(As Soo Min got drunk, their physical contact continued.)

93
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,560
- It's uncomfortable to look at. - It is.

94
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,100
- They became one. - I think you should stop.

95
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,900
- Keep hugging me. - You want me to?

96
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,669
Something bad had happened,

97
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,310
and she was feeling anxious.

98
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,279
That's why Soo Min didn't want...

99
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,140
- to be apart from Yeong Seok. - Right.

100
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,550
Oh, my. You're in trouble. Get a grip on yourself.

101
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,490
After seeing a new side of Soo Min, Yeong Seok has a lot on his mind.

102
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:16,130
Are you usually that out of it whenever you drink?

103
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,100
Isn't that normal when you drink?

104
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:19,560
That's normal for you?

105
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,800
That's why I won't drink for a while.

106
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,140
(Sighing)

107
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,010
Seriously.

108
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,580
I felt your sigh all the way here.

109
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,240
I gave you a hard time yesterday, didn't I?

110
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,310
- It was pretty hard. - What?

111
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,650
It felt like...

112
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,050
dealing with an obnoxious customer.

113
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,450
That's how it felt.

114
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,460
You were cute.

115
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,690
She wasn't cute at all. She was obnoxious.

116
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,460
You weren't cute at all.

117
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,970
This is scary.

118
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,270
I wanted to abandon you. You were terrible.

119
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,669
(The air is getting heavier.)

120
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,609
She could have said, "I was having..."

121
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,709
- "a hard time last night." - Right.

122
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,309
- "So I drank after a long time." - Exactly.

123
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,349
"I'm sorry about my behavior."

124
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,649
- Right. - If she had apologized,

125
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,650
- he'd be more understanding. - Right.

126
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,849
- You seem to know very well. - But she was too casual about it.

127
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,490
I said it as if I'm experienced,

128
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,460
but I've never been there.

129
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,289
I was saying it out of empathy.

130
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,689
- I see. - Yes.

131
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,129
That would've been a better way to handle it.

132
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,130
Right.

133
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,960
(Yeong Seok moved away from Soo Min after the breakfast date.)

134
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:30,600
I couldn't act...

135
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,270
like I usually do.

136
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,140
- The air feels very heavy. - The atmosphere got heavy.

137
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,110
Aren't you sitting too far from me?

138
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,150
(Walking on eggshells and feeling awkward)

139
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,780
I just didn't talk.

140
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,520
I was probably feeling disappointed.

141
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,920
I have no idea what might happen.

142
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,760
(Hyun Joong and Si Yeon, on the other hand)

143
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,800
Are we going to see a wedding consultant?

144
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,670
Gosh, I have no idea.

145
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,440
Do you want to sleep instead?

146
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,209
(Si Yeon doesn't look well today.)

147
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,170
What's the matter?

148
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,740
What time did you sleep?

149
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,150
I fell asleep after seeing that it was 3:30am.

150
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,650
- Really? Why? - Yes.

151
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,980
- Did you have a lot on your mind? - No, I just couldn't sleep.

152
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,020
- You couldn't sleep? - I slept less than an hour.

153
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,159
- Gosh. - Goodness.

154
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,219
An hour? Really?

155
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,220
(Si Yeon is tired from not sleeping enough.)

156
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,290
I don't think that she's feeling well,

157
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,700
so I plan to take care of her.

158
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,870
- What's wrong here? - What?

159
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,400
I don't know.

160
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,240
Why are you... Are you a troublemaker?

161
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,680
- No. - Your calf got bruised yesterday.

162
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,479
I don't know how I got bruised.

163
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,879
My heart got bruised too.

164
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,310
Your heart got bruised?

165
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,550
Seeing you get hurt makes me feel bad.

166
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,250
You're being funny.

167
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,050
I'm frozen right now.

168
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,390
You're cute even when you're sulky.

169
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,260
I'm not being sulky.

170
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,300
Then you're just cute.

171
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,540
When I look at you, I find you cute.

172
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,339
He's trying very hard.

173
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,340
(Hyun Joong is trying hard to help her by showing affection.)

174
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,980
Nice to meet you.

175
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:23,250
(Hyun Joong and Si Yeon move on to meet with a wedding planner.)

176
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:26,550
Any idea on what kind of wedding you'd like to have?

177
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,549
I'd like my wedding to be outdoors.

178
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,890
Outdoors?

179
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,489
Have you thought of what kind of dress you'd like?

180
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,229
A beaded wedding dress wouldn't work outside.

181
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,600
- Something neat? - Maybe a silk dress?

182
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,470
You'd look beautiful in anything.

183
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,240
Gosh, let go of your fist.

184
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,040
Okay.

185
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,409
If you'd like your wedding outdoors,

186
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:50,940
you'd need...

187
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,010
more flower decorations than regular wedding halls.

188
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,950
If there are a lot of flower decorations,

189
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,390
how will I tell you apart from the flowers?

190
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,790
That's cute.

191
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,629
How will I tell you apart from the flowers?

192
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,630
Goodness.

193
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,130
What's wrong with you today?

194
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,470
I'm bad at lying.

195
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,840
Sometimes, Hyun Joong has a strange sense of humor.

196
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,010
He's so hilarious.

197
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,179
A cafe? I'm so excited.

198
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,440
(Hyun Joong and Si Yeon go on a date at a cafe.)

199
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,550
I'm cold.

200
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,450
- Are you cold? - Yes, I'm so cold.

201
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,580
(Thinking)

202
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,489
(Flirting with his breath to make her warm)

203
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,390
- With his breath? - What is he doing?

204
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,889
(Si Yeon is falling in love with his endless affection.)

205
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,390
What's going on with you today?

206
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,230
I'm excited because we're going to a cafe.

207
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,270
I was so excited for our first date at a cafe.

208
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:54,710
Wasn't the couple zone party fun last night?

209
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,340
Was it fun for you?

210
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,310
I'm not sure.

211
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,410
I didn't have fun.

212
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,880
- What? - Why not?

213
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,880
- No. - Why not?

214
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,249
- It was very... - Was it difficult?

215
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,760
Yes, it was very difficult for me.

216
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,130
- I had a meeting with your parents. - Yes.

217
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,130
I was so nervous that I was crouching.

218
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,030
But although I was very nervous,

219
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,000
your parents were very nice.

220
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,040
(Enjoy your food, my dear.)

221
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,170
My goodness.

222
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,510
I was very grateful that they were trying so hard.

223
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,450
Then I heard a story...

224
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,380
that I hadn't expected at all.

225
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:43,049
(Si Yeon heard the story of Hyun Joong's family.)

226
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,219
His sister had a heart problem when she was 12.

227
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,660
So she passed away.

228
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,790
(They talked about Hyun Joong's sister to Si Yeon.)

229
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,300
On top of feeling tense during the meeting,

230
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,070
she heard such a private story from his family.

231
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:58,870
I was very shocked at that moment.

232
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,870
And when I turned towards you,

233
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,410
you were holding back your emotions.

234
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:11,479
(He was holding back his feelings like everything was fine.)

235
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,850
I also held myself in.

236
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:19,160
Then we had a party, so it was terrible for me.

237
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,030
(She had no time to pull herself together before the party started.)

238
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:28,130
I wasn't in the mood to party that day.

239
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,370
(He finally realized how Si Yeon felt.)

240
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,540
I just wanted to be alone.

241
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,710
Or I wanted to be alone with you.

242
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,609
I wanted some peace and quiet.

243
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:40,610
- Peace and quiet. - Yes.
(Si Yeon needed time for herself.)

244
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,579
It seems like Hyun Joong had no idea about it.

245
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,580
(Hyun Joong didn't realize how Si Yeon had felt.)

246
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,350
I wasn't aware of it.

247
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,490
I realized it...

248
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:53,760
when she expressed her feelings honestly.

249
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:58,460
I'm still thinking about yesterday.

250
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,430
The time stopped when I came back from meeting your parents.

251
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,140
Maybe I'm having a mental breakdown.

252
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,579
Si Yeon wasn't in the mood to party that day.

253
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,810
She wanted to pull herself together quietly.

254
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,390
I don't know why I'm feeling this way.

255
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,720
It's hard to handle.

256
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,060
- Goodness. - Gosh.

257
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,960
She looked very tired,

258
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,900
and she was having a hard time.

259
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:38,670
If I like her and care about her,

260
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,700
I thought that being considerate of her...

261
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:45,240
should be my priority...

262
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,680
since she's having a hard time.

263
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,820
(Hyun Joong was always attentive to Si Yeon.)

264
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,620
- Do you want more coffee? - Yes.

265
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,260
(Hyun Joong was always considerate of her in detail.)

266
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,990
- You must like coffee. - Yes.

267
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,129
I got some coffee.

268
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,299
- For later? - Yes.

269
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,529
(He remembered what Si Yeon liked.)

270
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,270
- I put it on. - Does it hurt?

271
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,840
No, it doesn't hurt. Is it coffee?

272
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,540
- Yes. - Where did you find it? Goodness.

273
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,010
I'm so happy.

274
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,439
(At every moment, he had been by her side quietly.)

275
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,940
Hyun Joong is really considerate.

276
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,050
To be honest...

277
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,550
My feelings for her haven't changed at all.

278
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,590
I definitely want to propose to her,

279
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,489
but it's harder for me to see her...

280
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,030
having a difficult time.

281
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,400
(Hyun Joong decided to be considerate of Si Yeon again.)

282
00:12:39,401 --> 00:12:40,460
I think that...

283
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,870
leaving the show...

284
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,210
seems like a good idea.

285
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,469
What? No.

286
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,610
- That was sudden. - Come on.

287
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,540
- What on earth... - That was quite sudden.

288
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,610
Leaving the show...

289
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,020
seems like a good idea.

290
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,390
What do you think?

291
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,419
From the way Hyun Joong sees it,

292
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,720
he's trying to find a solution to ease the burden on her.

293
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,930
But his solution was leaving the show.

294
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,559
I knew I was having a hard time.

295
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,630
But to be honest, that option didn't cross my mind.

296
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,300
- Right. - Right. That's not right.

297
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,070
I didn't want her to be in pain.

298
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,270
That thought dominated me more, so I made that suggestion.

299
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,380
I was surprised.

300
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,380
It was quite unexpected.

301
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:34,219
Si Yeon could've wanted him to say, "I didn't know you felt that way."

302
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,419
"Handling this alone must've been tough."

303
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,989
- "Let's talk about this together." - Right.

304
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,219
That's all that she might have wanted...

305
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,419
- to hear. - That's right.

306
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,390
- That could have been it. - Right.

307
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,060
I do want to be alone for a bit.

308
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,669
Being overly considerate...

309
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,600
caused him to make a poor decision.

310
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,810
It didn't need to go that far.

311
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,339
(The two of them come back with an icy silence between them.)

312
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,450
- The silence is so cold. - How upsetting.

313
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:07,820
(They go back to their room without talking to each other.)

314
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,389
In my opinion, Hyun Joong...

315
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,990
was unnecessarily considerate.

316
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,759
He shouldn't have mentioned leaving the show.

317
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,800
I agree.

318
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,630
(Sighing)

319
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,400
When he mentioned leaving the show,

320
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,710
it was like my mind had a blackout.

321
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,810
All the good moments we shared together...

322
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,510
hit me at once.

323
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,680
Gosh, wait.

324
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,620
Of course, I would very much like...

325
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,190
to propose to her.

326
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,930
"How did this happen?"

327
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:00,140
Here's an analogy. Let's say there's a couple.

328
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,039
- She says, "This is hard on me." - Yes.

329
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,439
Then he suddenly says, "Shall we break up then?"

330
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,780
- Right. - It came out of nowhere.

331
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,980
That's it.

332
00:15:05,981 --> 00:15:08,079
To make it worse, that's not what Hyun Joong meant.

333
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,409
- Right. - But Si Yeon is...

334
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,749
having all kinds of thoughts.

335
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,079
- Right. - Men struggle to understand...

336
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,320
- women's language. - Right.

337
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:17,120
Wouldn't they be able to work it out if they talked to each other?

338
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,189
(Meanwhile, in the single zone...)

339
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,590
All right, let's look at the single zone.

340
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:24,090
(Sang Gyeong is waiting for her in the car.)

341
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,459
They're going on a date to talk.

342
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,829
- It's Sang Gyeong and Joo Hee. - Yes.

343
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,200
- You didn't bring a jacket, right? - No.

344
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,700
(Tomorrow?)

345
00:15:31,701 --> 00:15:32,769
See you tomorrow.

346
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:33,969
Sang Gyeong thought...

347
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,469
she promised to have breakfast with him the next day.

348
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,470
Right.

349
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,539
(But she chose Jae Yeon.)

350
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,610
But Joo Hee chose Jae Yeon.

351
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,579
I have no idea why Joo Hee didn't do what she said she would.

352
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,150
I at least wanted to talk to her.

353
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,489
He must want to hear it from her.

354
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,090
He can't just overlook what happened.

355
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,589
Did you enjoy your breakfast?

356
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,759
Did you like it?

357
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,430
I couldn't face you this morning.

358
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,130
- Really? - Of course, I couldn't.

359
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,070
Yes. The sense of betrayal this morning was quite raw.

360
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,869
I thought long and hard about this last night.

361
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,870
Yeah?

362
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,880
I told you I wanted to make up my mind.

363
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,649
I...

364
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,380
- And did you pick Jae Yeon? - Yes.

365
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,850
Is that so?

366
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,680
That's a sad expression on his face.

367
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,620
- Were you waiting for me? - Yes. I...

368
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,990
- I'm sorry. - I wanted to talk to you.

369
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:34,160
All this time, I felt that no one was being serious or sincere.

370
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,199
Then I finally felt that someone...

371
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,470
- was taking this seriously. - Yes.

372
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,640
But all of a sudden, this morning,

373
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,910
she chose another guy. I...

374
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,509
It must have shocked you.

375
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,009
Yes. I wanted to talk to you today.

376
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,879
And if you were being serious, I wanted to go with you.

377
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,049
- Really? - Yes.

378
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,920
That hasn't changed. If you're serious, I'd like to.

379
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,919
I always thought that you were an attractive woman.

380
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,090
So I thought I would talk to you this morning...

381
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,760
and head over to the couple zone together afterward.

382
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,929
(She hears about Sang Gyeong's feelings only now.)

383
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,729
But in the morning...

384
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,569
Well, you just told me you chose to go with Jae Yeon.

385
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,700
Well, I'm not sure anymore.

386
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,209
His feelings for her must have been quite serious.

387
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,210
- Yes. - So he seems more disappointed.

388
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,579
(In no time, they arrive at their date location.)

389
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,780
- We're here. - Let's get out.

390
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,380
- I'll get out from your side too. - Okay.

391
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,219
Let me give you my jacket.

392
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,290
- Put this on. - It's cold.

393
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:30,890
You said you wanted this jacket.

394
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,960
It's mine.

395
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,030
I lent it to you.

396
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,499
- Doesn't it look great on me? - It does.

397
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,199
- Let's go in. - I told you it was the right size.

398
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,470
(The two of them are at ease as they joke around.)

399
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,639
A wine bar? In broad daylight?

400
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,070
The ambiance looks nice. Then anything could happen.

401
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,180
This place is beautiful.

402
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:52,810
It's so pretty.

403
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,610
Yes, it's very beautiful.

404
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,919
(The wine they order is served.)

405
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,019
It's so pretty.

406
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,180
- Totally. - Yes.

407
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,790
I've never had anything like this.

408
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,150
- Cheers. - Great.

409
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,360
I usually drink up my first glass.

410
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,320
Really? Should we drink it up?

411
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,060
It's nice. It's sweet.

412
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,730
- It's really good. - Yes.

413
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,340
The morning was tough, wasn't it?

414
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,140
It was very tough.

415
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,369
I thought we would talk a lot...

416
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,140
over breakfast.

417
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,680
- If I had chosen you, - Yes.

418
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,910
I would have hurt someone.

419
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:33,720
Then did you decide to go with him because you felt...

420
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,190
bad for him?

421
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,389
- If that's why you chose him, - Yes.

422
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,760
You would be doing a bigger disservice to him.

423
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,790
I didn't pick him because I felt bad for him,

424
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:46,260
but because he proved that he could be trusted.

425
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,169
When it comes to marriage,

426
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,269
I think trust is the most important factor.

427
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,470
- I agree. - Yes.

428
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,509
I think he showed me that he was trustworthy.

429
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,510
Yes.

430
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,910
That was the biggest reason I decided to pick him.

431
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,650
- So... - Well done.

432
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:05,249
Anyway, I thought that you already had someone definite.

433
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,380
- I see. - So...

434
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,549
I thought that it didn't have to be me,

435
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,320
and you wouldn't care much even if I didn't pick you.

436
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,260
This is our third day together.

437
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,790
You can't forget that.

438
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,560
Well, as for Jin Ju,

439
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,730
I feel like I'm not getting 100 percent of her for some reason.

440
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,940
I really don't know why.

441
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,739
I'm not sure if I feel that way...

442
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,810
because she tends to filter out what she says...

443
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,240
or because she's not showing me the real her.

444
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,879
So it feels like I'm talking to her...

445
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,079
without getting to know the real her.

446
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,119
That's why I thought going to the couple zone with her...

447
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,650
would be a good chance to get to know the real her.

448
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,260
So I only chose her.

449
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,420
But...

450
00:19:46,421 --> 00:19:48,129
(He went all in with Jin Ju, )

451
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,790
(but his dream of going to the couple zone was shattered.)

452
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,760
Yes. It didn't work out.

453
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,400
I see.

454
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,669
The real side of Jin Ju Sang Gyeong is talking about...

455
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,670
Go on.

456
00:19:57,671 --> 00:20:00,469
Don't you think it's the side of her when she's with Jae Keun?

457
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,509
- Right. - Yes.

458
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,409
- She feels at ease around him. - Yes.

459
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,140
She can talk to him about her innermost feelings.

460
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,950
I kept thinking about the fact that things weren't clicking with her.

461
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,979
But you're the one who openly told me about your interest.

462
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,619
That's why I wanted to talk to you over breakfast today.

463
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,419
And if we clicked over breakfast,

464
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,220
I thought it'd be nice to go to the couple zone together.

465
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,589
- That's what I had in mind. - Yes.

466
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,560
But this is a pity, right?

467
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,600
Oh, no. I might cry.

468
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,470
- Why? - Because of what you said.

469
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,440
Don't cry. Why?

470
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:39,680
If you cry, I'm going to feel bad.

471
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:44,649
(The communal lounge of the single zone at that moment)

472
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:45,780
Do you want to drink?

473
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,050
- I don't want to drink. - Why not?

474
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,449
- What's wrong? - No. Nothing. I'm good.

475
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,689
Earlier...

476
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:53,689
She made it clear to me...

477
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,930
- that she'd go with me. - I see.

478
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,690
So I feel good.

479
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,100
I feel good.

480
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,729
I'm good. There's nothing much.

481
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,940
- It must be a load off your chest. - Yes, it's a load off my chest.

482
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,700
That's all that matters.

483
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,509
After having breakfast with Joo Hee,

484
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,940
he can certainly trust that they will be together.

485
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,879
- Do you know what I did yesterday? - What did you do?

486
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,050
- So... - Yes.

487
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,280
Si Yeon is my roommate.

488
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:22,850
I said,

489
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:26,359
"Male Number 24 is so handsome."

490
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,690
(Sang Gyeong is so handsome.)

491
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,390
(Embarrassed)

492
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,829
When I said that,

493
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:34,029
she went like this, "What?" That's what she said.

494
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,030
I said,

495
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,529
"Seriously. Isn't he really handsome?"

496
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:40,440
"Objectively speaking, he's handsome."

497
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,069
My gosh. This is weird.

498
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:45,510
But why do you keep complimenting me?

499
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,879
- No. But listen. So... - Yes.

500
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,179
(They're in their own world again.)

501
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:52,180
It's so embarrassing. But this feels good. Thank you.

502
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:55,820
It's been a while since I felt this good.

503
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,520
- But this... - Yes.

504
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,090
- Thank you. You know, - Sure.

505
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,399
I need to express myself too.

506
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,169
I think you're pretty.

507
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,130
I mean it. I think you're beautiful.

508
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,570
But...

509
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,099
I rarely heard that kind of compliment from people.

510
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,209
- Really? - Yes.

511
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,610
- Why not? - I don't know.

512
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,579
He's attracted to women...

513
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,810
who can openly express their interest like Joo Hee.

514
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,249
That's why I like you.

515
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,950
(That's why I like you.)

516
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,059
Things seem to be going well for them.

517
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,360
Gosh, what's that look?

518
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:39,400
In my opinion, this date could be a game changer.

519
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:40,599
- I do think so. - But I think...

520
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,269
once she makes up her mind, she follows through.

521
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,270
(What is she feeling right now?)

522
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,999
- Let's have some food. - Right.

523
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,140
You must be hungry.

524
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,540
- I ate this a lot yesterday. - That too.

525
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:53,410
(Sang Gyeong holds the cheese for Joo Hee.)

526
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,320
Was I too much for holding the cheese for you?

527
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,020
Jae Yeon might scold me.

528
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,920
He might say, "Are you out of your mind?"

529
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,120
Then I'll say, "Sorry."

530
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,760
(Even his joke can't lighten her up.)

531
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,159
This is too hard for me. Well...

532
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,160
Yes?

533
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:17,699
Had I not given him my word this morning...

534
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,170
If I didn't make it clear to him...

535
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,340
I know that he has been waiting...

536
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,240
for me.

537
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,880
You know, this is such a pity for me.

538
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,519
(Single zone)

539
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,220
Jung Won. Actually, you're such a softie.

540
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,529
I thought you'd be a cold person.

541
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,800
- So I couldn't talk to you. - He's so warmhearted.

542
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,530
I wouldn't say I'm sweet or anything.

543
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:51,230
But when we talked about coming back to the single zone,

544
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,969
- my heart felt so heavy. - I see.

545
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,070
I see.

546
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,239
(Sin Da comes out to the communal lounge.)

547
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,680
- She's here. - There she is.

548
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,549
Oh, no. Look at Jung Won's face.

549
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,080
He's definitely feeling conscious of her.

550
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,050
Hey.

551
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,490
Nice to see you, everyone.

552
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,620
It's so quiet in here.

553
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,130
(Sin Da takes a seat in the communal lounge.)

554
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,229
Gosh, she's sitting right in front of him.

555
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,230
(She's close to Jung Won.)

556
00:24:18,231 --> 00:24:20,260
It's like the calm before the storm.

557
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,629
(Seung Yeon also comes out to the communal lounge.)

558
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:23,970
- My gosh. - Seung Yeon is out too.

559
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,810
(The three of them are in the same space.)

560
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:33,340
I'm sorry to say this, but it's so entertaining to watch.

561
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,979
Gosh, her facial expression changed.

562
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,010
(When they're reading the room, )

563
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,180
(Jung Won gets up.)

564
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,350
(As he clears his throat, )

565
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,720
(Seung Yeon and Sin Da react.)

566
00:24:42,721 --> 00:24:44,020
Is that a signal?

567
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,289
Does he want her to come out?

568
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:48,730
(They start trying to read each other's moves.)

569
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,200
Seung Yeon is following Jung Won out.

570
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:53,660
There she goes.

571
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,970
(And Sin Da is watching her go.)

572
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,069
When I saw them together in person,

573
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,500
it was so annoying.

574
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,610
Jung Won will completely...

575
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,580
be out of my mind forever.

576
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,749
I like Sin Da for her honesty. Don't you like her?

577
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,979
- I do too. She's cute. - Yes.

578
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,580
- I would've been upset too. - Yes.

579
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:16,149
But Sin Da is waiting for Ji Woong, right?

580
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,150
- Yes. - Yes.

581
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:19,789
(Jung Won climbs up the stairs.)

582
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,090
He comes up the staircase.

583
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,689
(Seung Yeon climbs up the same stairs.)

584
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:24,790
She's following after him.

585
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,730
Where did he go?

586
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,569
Do you know where Jung Won went?

587
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:34,800
- Who? - Jung Won.

588
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,010
- You haven't seen him, right? - No.

589
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,140
(Even if they miss each other along the path...)

590
00:25:38,141 --> 00:25:41,510
Seung Yeon is proactively expressing her interest in Jung Won.

591
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,749
What? Where were you? No one was on that side.

592
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,019
We were here looking for you only a moment ago.

593
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,520
- Did you hear us? - Did you?

594
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:52,590
Given everything that's happened, I hope things work out for them.

595
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,329
I can't believe this is the same room...

596
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:56,690
we were in a few hours ago.

597
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:59,899
Right? The atmosphere is very different.

598
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,430
There were lit candles here.

599
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,599
(They had their secret date in this room late at night.)

600
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,440
This is the room where they had their secret date.

601
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,910
Stay here. I'll come back.

602
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,639
Really?

603
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,679
- Yes. - That must've been so exciting.

604
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,510
(They meet again in the room where their feelings were confirmed.)

605
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,450
Well, personally,

606
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,820
the time has come for me now.

607
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,590
The time for me to follow my heart.

608
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,990
I think everyone is in a hurry.

609
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,660
They feel the urgency to express themselves to the people they like.

610
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:39,070
When you smile, your eyes curve.

611
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,170
Yes.

612
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,600
I like that.

613
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,369
Thank you.

614
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:44,980
- My gosh. - My goodness!

615
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,339
He's expressing himself right away.

616
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,480
- Gosh, that's so cool. - He likes that.

617
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:52,550
It snowed. I threw the snow at you.

618
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,620
- We built a snowman. - And this is what happened.

619
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,360
Oh, come on!

620
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,559
He threw the snow at Seung Yeon...

621
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,829
- on purpose. - Wait.

622
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,460
He scattered the snow on top of her head on purpose.

623
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:07,099
That was such an obvious way...

624
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,669
- to express his interest. - That method was quite innocent.

625
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:11,870
It was an adorable way of expressing his interest.

626
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,740
So you were in a musical about Pororo?

627
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,140
No. You know the theme song for "PORORO THE LITTLE PENGUIN?"

628
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:18,539
I sang the song.

629
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,640
I don't know the song.

630
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,180
What?

631
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,249
I love playing the most

632
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,650
You don't know this song?

633
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,120
I do know that I love playing the most too.

634
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:32,960
- Well, listen. - What's wrong with you?

635
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,930
That was a good joke.

636
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,530
I can do Doraemon's impression.

637
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:38,900
Could you show it to me?

638
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,470
"Doraemon. He hit me."

639
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:47,340
"Hey, let me hit him back for you."

640
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,569
Her impressions are so good.

641
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:52,010
(As he got to know her, he began to like her.)

642
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,579
That's so impressive.

643
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,850
All of a sudden...

644
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,710
- Her cheerful personality... - Yes.

645
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,180
- must have appealed to her. - I bet.

646
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,020
(The two of them are having a conversation again.)

647
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,950
I feel the most comfortable here.

648
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,059
Really?

649
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,760
This is my favorite room too.

650
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,060
To be honest, this is fascinating.

651
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,600
It feels like it's all about the timing and it's meant to be.

652
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,330
I hope they end up together.

653
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,339
(Late afternoon in the single zone)

654
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,310
My gosh, I can't look. What am I going to do?

655
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,779
- He's about to kill us. - Right?

656
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,340
What if we go in and he starts beating me up?

657
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,909
Then you just get beat up, what else?

658
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,150
- What could you do? - What did you say? Why?

659
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,120
- I don't know. It's not about me. - Clear up the misunderstanding.

660
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,950
- They're finally back. - They're here.

661
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,119
- I see. With Sang Gyeong? - You can't look at them.

662
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,760
- She went out with Sang Gyeong? - Where are they going?

663
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,630
I see. They went on the 1-on-1 date.

664
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:47,060
(Sang Gyeong and Joo Hee come back to the single zone.)

665
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,160
See you later.

666
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:50,200
- See you later. - Yes.

667
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,470
Why does it look like they're sad to say goodbye?

668
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,509
Did you have fun?

669
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,539
We had fun.

670
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,349
- She said she'd pick you. - What?

671
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,950
She said she'd stick with you.

672
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,150
- She told me that this morning. - Yes.

673
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,190
- I wasn't worried. - Right.

674
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:14,190
Since I'm thinking about her, I should go to Joo Hee.

675
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:17,129
Maybe, I should talk to her.

676
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,390
It's better than doing nothing here.

677
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,959
It didn't happen just now. He's been thinking about her.

678
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,100
He's been thinking about her all day long.

679
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,270
He's heading off to Joo Hee as if he's been waiting for her.

680
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:28,240
Is Joo Hee here?

681
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,669
You're back.

682
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:31,670
Pardon?

683
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:33,909
I didn't have time to ask you.

684
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:35,409
- I see. Really? - Could you fill it out?

685
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:36,610
I'll fill it out for you too.

686
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,149
I see. It looks like Jae Yeon and Joo Hee...

687
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:42,219
will ask three questions they're curious about each other.

688
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,319
(The 2 of them will exchange 3 questions about each other.)

689
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,419
(Guidebook to the Exchanging-Questions Date)

690
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,490
What did you write down?

691
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,489
"What do you think about a marriage..."

692
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:48,859
- "where you start with nothing..." - "Where you start with nothing..."

693
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,259
- "and build a future together?" - Oh.

694
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,390
(A question from Jae Yeon)

695
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,429
My next question is,

696
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,800
- "Even if we don't have anything," - Okay.

697
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:58,100
"are you strong enough to overcome..."

698
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,400
- "the hardships together?" - I see.

699
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,569
What if I'm not strong enough?

700
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,910
- If you're not strong enough? - "This is too hard for me."

701
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:08,910
You can feel that way as long as you stay by my side.

702
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,409
"I don't want to work."

703
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,519
"I'll be a housewife."

704
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,189
"Then it will be slightly harder for me."

705
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,620
"I should work twice as hard."

706
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,760
Here's mine.

707
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:21,619
Does opening up a clinic or a pharmacy come first?

708
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,129
Or does buying our house come first?

709
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,629
If buying a house would clearly yield a better profit,

710
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,129
I would want to buy a house first.

711
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:29,769
But I would want to open up a clinic or a pharmacy first.

712
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:31,900
- Right? I agree. - Yes.

713
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,540
"Doctor, we're having cup noodles for lunch again."

714
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,140
"Be ready to be frugal."

715
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:43,549
It's nice to see them plan their future...

716
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,110
- together. - Right.

717
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:47,179
- Because... - I spend a lot of money on food.

718
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,619
Really? How much?

719
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,250
I order food every day.

720
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,220
I like tasty food.

721
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,620
I love eating late at night.

722
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,230
Really?

723
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,830
I rarely eat late at night.

724
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,230
I'm a pro at eating alone.

725
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,360
You'd eat alone?

726
00:30:59,361 --> 00:31:00,459
- What? - That's worse.

727
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,569
- But I won't when I'm with you. - How could you do that?

728
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,769
How could you do that?

729
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,100
I might secretly have the food alone.

730
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,869
It's like... "I'm going to eat. You can't eat."

731
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,139
Is that what you'll do?

732
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,769
- What? - I'll probably smell everything.

733
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:11,910
Then eat with me.

734
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,880
- Eat with me then. - I'll gain weight.

735
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,210
Eat only a little bit.

736
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,179
- That's impossible. - Eat only a little bit.

737
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,950
I would want to eat a lot.

738
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,149
Yeah? Then eat a lot.

739
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,750
- Then I'll gain weight. - It's okay. Whatever.

740
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,219
- You said, "Whatever." - It's okay if you do. Whatever.

741
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,159
- "Whatever." - Whatever. Gaining weight is fine.

742
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,560
(The two of them finally spend a romantic time after a while.)

743
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,459
(Sang Gyeong and Young Taek talk to each other on the 2nd floor.)

744
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,960
Gosh, they're coming.

745
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:36,870
Yes.

746
00:31:36,871 --> 00:31:38,640
(Sang Gyeong and Young Taek spot the two of them together.)

747
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,700
I spotted them.

748
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,470
Sang Gyeong and Jin Ju had breakfast together.

749
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,439
Then they went on a date with other people.

750
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,580
- That's right. - Yes.

751
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:50,249
Sang Gyeong doesn't seem all that happy to watch Jin Ju...

752
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:51,579
and Jae Keun come back from their date.

753
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,880
Right.

754
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:56,290
Hello.

755
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,020
Hello.

756
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,589
Just now, Jin Ju saw...

757
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,259
that Joo Hee and Jae Yeon...

758
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,929
- are together. - Right.

759
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,400
- Just in case. - Right.

760
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,360
What were you doing?

761
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:10,200
You didn't talk to the guys?

762
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,539
I didn't see Male Number 24 today.

763
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:16,510
- Same here. - Male Number 24 went on a date.

764
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,710
- With Female Number 18? - Yes.

765
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,639
- I see. - With her?

766
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,880
- Yes. - They had wine.

767
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,079
They had wine?

768
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,180
(The two of them had wine?)

769
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,719
Jin Ju just found out that Sang Gyeong and Joo Hee...

770
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,120
went on a date.

771
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,390
Here's the problem.

772
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,019
I didn't have a chance to talk to him...

773
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,389
after my decision yesterday.

774
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:35,259
But they talked for two hours...

775
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,260
- yesterday. - Yes.

776
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:38,390
- They went on a date again today. - Yes.

777
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,699
So anything could happen.

778
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,470
But as for Jae Keun... Look.

779
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:45,770
This kind of thing also worries me if I'm being honest.

780
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,240
He's saved up 20,000 dollars so far.

781
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:53,110
(He currently has 20,000 dollars in cash.)

782
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:55,349
He said that he frequently went on trips and spent a lot.

783
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,780
But not Sang Gyeong?

784
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,780
Not him. He's got more.

785
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,720
He owns more.

786
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,319
- Then... - And he's...

787
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,620
That's a huge difference.

788
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:08,959
This is an essential matter when thinking about the future.

789
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,390
- You're right. - It's so realistic.

790
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,760
What I look for in men are...

791
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,799
a thick upper body, someone who works out,

792
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,899
- and lips that don't look petty. - Yes.

793
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,269
- Jae Keun checks off all of those, - Right.

794
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:20,899
- but Sang Gyeong doesn't. - Exactly.

795
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,640
You can't ignore that either.

796
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:26,110
Joo Hee has entered the women's lounge.

797
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,340
But it's already...

798
00:33:27,341 --> 00:33:28,579
(The air in the room changes upon Joo Hee's entrance.)

799
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,280
- What? - What happened?

800
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:36,749
All of Jin Ju's attention is...

801
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,860
on Joo Hee right now.

802
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,860
But I don't want to see her do well.

803
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:49,669
She's trying to go for Sang Gyeong...

804
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:51,430
if I look like I'm going for Jae Keun, right?

805
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,670
That's obvious.

806
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,579
But it might be this.

807
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,109
She might be just wanting what she didn't choose.

808
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,449
- That happens to people. - Yes.

809
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:05,279
- That could be a part of it. - Yes.

810
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,450
I'm also like that at times.

811
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,019
They've never talked to each other since breakfast,

812
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,060
so I don't think she knows how Sang Gyeong feels.

813
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,730
(What's going on in the men's lounge?)

814
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:18,530
Jae Keun, I was going to stay out of it,

815
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:22,699
but Young Taek was in the bathroom, saying, "There they are."

816
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,970
He made sure that I saw the two of you coming back...

817
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:26,969
from the second floor.

818
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:29,110
- Right. - He had to point it out.

819
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,640
He had to.

820
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,010
Sang Gyeong was paying attention to them.

821
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:37,049
I'm not sure, though. But Jin Ju is totally serious.

822
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:39,350
It looked like she was actually here...

823
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,919
to find a potential spouse.

824
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,920
Really?

825
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,389
She's thinking about realistic matters,

826
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:48,830
not to mention her feelings.

827
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:50,889
I can't help but assess everything in general.

828
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:53,660
You know, including the men's conditions.

829
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,830
I'm thinking about whether I can...

830
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:59,500
picture a future with him and have a stable life.

831
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,409
Right. Jin Ju is incredibly sincere...

832
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,640
about marriage,

833
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,680
so she holds others in check...

834
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,580
and deliberates.

835
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,209
Has she still not decided, then?

836
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,409
Of course not.

837
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:15,050
Even to me, Sang Gyeong is attractive.

838
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,420
I'm out because my lips are thin.

839
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:21,420
But I honestly think you can't predict that.

840
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,659
Don't be too burdened by that choice.

841
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,660
He's right.
- Seriously. - Seriously.

842
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,899
This is a jungle.

843
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,930
I'm at war. My head is constantly at war.

844
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:33,000
You should just follow your heart.

845
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:34,899
It's the last day. You don't want to regret things.

846
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,840
What if I end up choosing Joo Hee?

847
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,810
I don't know if you also noticed,

848
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:43,710
but the men are starting to show their true feelings.

849
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:46,379
They're on an actual battlefield without any guns.

850
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,119
Of course, they are.

851
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,420
Marriage isn't easy.

852
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,620
- It is hard. - It is.

853
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,959
(Sin Da came to the communal lounge.)

854
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,960
Come here.

855
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,789
What do we do?

856
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:00,660
Number 11 said that I would have been his favorite...

857
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,270
if he hadn't been a couple.

858
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:06,140
He says he's not so sure about his current one.

859
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:09,570
Ji Woong and Ha Yeon are also in a tough spot.

860
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:13,940
I'm not exactly certain at the moment.

861
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:18,150
What should I do to keep you with me?

862
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,720
Come to the single zone with me.

863
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:25,250
So he's leaning toward that.

864
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,860
Then, we're breaking this up.

865
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,060
Let's break it up and go.

866
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:31,160
It works if we break up.

867
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,300
That's too sad, though.

868
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,900
Even though we meet again...

869
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:37,000
How does he flirt with you?

870
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:39,800
Like, "You're so pretty. I thought about you."

871
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,570
If he doesn't come after everything he said...

872
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,639
He'll definitely come.

873
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,909
- Will he? - Yes.

874
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:49,750
I believe that you can turn this around.

875
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:53,079
(Ji Woong must come to the single zone...)

876
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,520
(before the final proposal vote.)

877
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,290
Don't you want to check it out?

878
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:58,189
There's nothing I can do.

879
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:00,389
We can be matched up again while we're there.

880
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:02,630
Do you actually think Sin Da will just sit there?

881
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:04,890
She might throw all her moves at you.

882
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,929
When is he coming? I hope he comes.

883
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,260
He'll absolutely come for you.

884
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:13,070
I believed that Number 11 meant it.

885
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,810
I thought he might choose me this time.

886
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:19,210
A woman has her sixth sense.

887
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,680
You have the upper hand, though.

888
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,779
If Sin Da gives her 100 percent, you only give 70 to 80 percent...

889
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,920
and win.

890
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,890
What should I do?

891
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,720
I want to be rejudged in the single zone.

892
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,390
I'm not so sure how you feel now.

893
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,960
What?

894
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:39,599
What is he talking about?

895
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,899
She's been telling him the whole time.

896
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,900
Ji Woong seems...

897
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:46,500
- He'll come downstairs, right? - You bet.

898
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,940
If he doesn't come after what he said,

899
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:50,909
he won't be able to stay in the couple zone...

900
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,640
out of guilt.

901
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:55,139
I should change into proper attire.

902
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,710
I shouldn't have dressed comfortably today.

903
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,080
I should have dressed up.

904
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,550
Is there anything else you want to tell me?

905
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:08,090
This might be our last moment together.

906
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:12,830
I'm still glad...

907
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:17,400
that I got to come here,

908
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,800
meet a good guy, and have a good time.

909
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,669
(She calmly tells him her genuine feelings...)

910
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,910
(despite the confusion.)

911
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:30,880
Still, I'll only think about you.

912
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,720
(Ji Woong leaves at that moment.)

913
00:38:36,721 --> 00:38:37,790
What?

914
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,260
Wait, Ji Woong. Are you going to the single zone?

915
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:46,999
(There is an alert in the single zone.)

916
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
What's the alert for?

917
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,599
Is he coming downstairs?

918
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,900
(Is he...?)

919
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,109
I think he is.

920
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:58,639
(Will Ji Woong...)

921
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,739
(come to the single zone?)

922
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,980
What's going on?

923
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,109
(Where is Ji Woong going?)

924
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:06,020
- Where are you going, Ji Woong? - Where is he going?

925
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,689
- What? - What?

926
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,190
(He's deep in thought...)

927
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:17,130
(in a room by himself.)

928
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:19,530
(During the pre-interview)

929
00:39:19,531 --> 00:39:20,760
Do you have a hard time trusting women?

930
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,130
Yes, I do.

931
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:26,499
I was single for 8 to 9 years after my first relationship...

932
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,510
because I was betrayed by my ex whom I trusted so much.

933
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,140
She went on a blind date behind my back,

934
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:35,540
and they hit it off at first sight.

935
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,949
The process of being dumped...

936
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:40,779
was pretty messy.

937
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,850
I ended up watching all of it in person,

938
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:45,020
which she intended.

939
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:47,660
I felt so betrayed back then...

940
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:51,590
that I even hated women.

941
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,960
(During the men's speed train in Round 1)

942
00:39:52,961 --> 00:39:56,170
(Number 11's condition for marriage: Don't show affection.)

943
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:58,229
- Why would he date anyone, then? - He must be a total thinker.

944
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,400
Why would you be in a relationship?

945
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,910
(Ji Woong's condition for marriage shocked everyone.)

946
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:04,970
Once I'm in a relationship,

947
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:07,880
I find it awkward and burdensome...

948
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:11,410
to say, "I love you."

949
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:15,280
I'd think, "Why does she love me?"

950
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:19,119
I couldn't trust anyone enough to date.

951
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,260
(He struggles to open up due to his trauma.)

952
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:23,130
He's been hurt before.

953
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:27,730
I think it takes a long time for me to trust someone.

954
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:31,270
I must have kept my guard up around Ha Yeon as well.

955
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:35,370
I think going to the single zone might be better.

956
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:36,470
Don't go.

957
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,240
I'd like to try talking to people who aren't interested in me.

958
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:43,650
I only want to talk to someone who's interested in me.

959
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:47,119
If you're certain, you can show it.

960
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,319
I am certain about you.

961
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,849
(Ha Yeon has always given him conviction.)

962
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:51,550
I'm absolutely sure.

963
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:56,790
Ha Yeon has never tried testing the waters...

964
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:59,360
and has shown that she's going all in for me.

965
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:02,330
I realized that she meant it.

966
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,900
I didn't want to lose her.

967
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:13,140
I've been into you from the start.

968
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,310
Oh, stop.

969
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:20,450
(Her sincerity came through.)

970
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:25,220
You should take a leave of absence in January and move in with me.

971
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,590
I could.

972
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,720
- Are you serious? - Yes.

973
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:37,030
(Ji Woong did not go to the single zone.)

974
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,169
(He stayed?)

975
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:40,899
- He didn't go! - No way!

976
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,709
Ji Woong, I didn't know you'd been hurt before.

977
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,510
I apologize.

978
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:46,879
He thought, "You still want me after what I put you through?"

979
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,180
He wanted to see if she was genuinely into him.

980
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,609
- He wanted a final confirmation. - To confirm it.

981
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:53,380
- That's unbelievable. - Seriously.

982
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,850
(And the voting alert goes off in the single zone.)

983
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:02,560
You will now pick the final proposal partners.

984
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:06,530
Had I known this would happen, I would have prepared other options.

985
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,269
I thought he'd surely come downstairs...

986
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:11,000
since I went to his room to say goodbye.

987
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,769
It really makes me angry that he's doing this...

988
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:13,800
at the last minute.

989
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,169
Sin Da is left all alone.

990
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:18,170
Poor her.

991
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:24,480
You will now pick the final proposal partners.

992
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:26,380
- Seriously? We have to pick now? - Yes.

993
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:29,790
At last, it's time to pick their final proposal partners,

994
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:32,990
which will tell us their genuine feelings.

995
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,760
The final proposal vote for tonight...

996
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:39,629
will only be made by the male participants.

997
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:40,960
Jeez.

998
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,230
The final proposal is tomorrow,

999
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:48,040
so you will only pick one person in this vote.

1000
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,069
- The men will pick... - Yes.

1001
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,740
Their final proposal partners today,

1002
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,140
and the women will pick theirs tomorrow.

1003
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:59,210
Female participants who haven't been chosen...

1004
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,979
must leave COUPLE PALACE.

1005
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,049
(If they're not chosen, they must leave.)

1006
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:05,720
Am I going home now?

1007
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,160
What's going to happen to Sin Da now?

1008
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,459
Upon hearing their name,

1009
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,230
the men will go to the women's lounge...

1010
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:15,730
and deliver his profile card.

1011
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:20,070
It's a chance to find closure.

1012
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,439
I could tell that they were all genuine,

1013
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,310
so I had to think about it seriously.

1014
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:27,979
I believed that it was fair...

1015
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,210
to choose the one that I was currently into.

1016
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:32,479
I'm torn.

1017
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,220
I don't know if I can choose one now.

1018
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:39,389
Today's vote is the men's final choice.

1019
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:42,259
Their decisions are crucial, then.

1020
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:43,430
- They are. - They are.

1021
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:46,760
Number 26, Lee Jung Won.

1022
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,700
Jung Won's decision.

1023
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,870
- Let's go. - Good luck.

1024
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:55,600
Jung Won broke up with Sin Da and came downstairs.

1025
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,170
Will he go for Seung Yeon?

1026
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:00,080
Or will there be another surprise?

1027
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:04,410
I came to the single zone...

1028
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,580
to see Seung Yeon.

1029
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:16,260
So, I obviously voted for Seung Yeon.

1030
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:19,129
(He chose Seung Yeon as his final proposal partner.)

1031
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:20,460
Good for them!

1032
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,440
Although I saw it coming,

1033
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,870
I still resented him.

1034
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:35,539
Seung Yeon and Jung Won's feelings for each other have grown wildly...

1035
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,710
ever since they were on the same page.

1036
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:40,850
Number Seven, Choi Jae Yeon.

1037
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,789
Here goes Jae Yeon.

1038
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:44,890
Is he going?

1039
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:46,920
(He goes over with the men's support.)

1040
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:52,060
She's been the only one for me from the beginning.

1041
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,560
I can be certain about one thing.

1042
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:58,500
Whoever comes, I'll do better than him.

1043
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:03,409
(He gave Joo Hee trust with his unchanging love...)

1044
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:07,180
(and got her confirmation.)

1045
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,410
I thought it was natural...

1046
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:14,620
to only have eyes for Joo Hee.

1047
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:17,089
I didn't have to think much.

1048
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:18,850
From beginning to end,

1049
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,960
my feelings won't change.

1050
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:28,729
As expected, Jae Yeon voted for Joo Hee...

1051
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:31,030
as his final proposal partner.

1052
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:33,099
He's straightforward. It's so cool.

1053
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,100
Indeed.

1054
00:45:34,101 --> 00:45:35,170
He never changed.

1055
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:39,370
Number 13, Kwon Young Taek.

1056
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,880
I tried to look into my heart,

1057
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:45,780
and I was drawn to Joo Hee.

1058
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:49,079
I decided to leave everything behind and go to her.

1059
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,820
I was going to choose her without hesitation.

1060
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,360
I'd like to talk to you later.

1061
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,759
(He gave Joo Hee his card...)

1062
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,100
(and chose her as his final proposal partner.)

1063
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:02,360
She already has two votes.

1064
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:06,539
Number Three, Hwang Jae Keun.

1065
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:09,669
(Male Number 3, Hwang Jae Keun)

1066
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:10,940
It's Jae Keun.

1067
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,879
He had a short yet deep conversation with Jin Ju.

1068
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,550
- Right. - They seem to have feelings,

1069
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:18,310
so I wonder who he will choose.

1070
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:20,649
She told me...

1071
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:23,320
that she had good feelings for Sang Gyeong as well.

1072
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:26,860
If I had been more capable...

1073
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:31,460
(He's been feeling small due to realistic issues.)

1074
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:35,160
I respect Jin Ju's decision.

1075
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:37,469
(Will he pick Jin Ju?)

1076
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:38,530
Let's find out.

1077
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:42,100
Please think it through.

1078
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:45,270
- All right? - I will.

1079
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:46,979
- Okay? - Yes.

1080
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:48,639
(He picked Jin Ju as his final proposal partner.)

1081
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,880
- Awesome! - How lovely.

1082
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:53,880
A lot has been on his mind.

1083
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:55,679
This means...

1084
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,950
I can't wait to find out who Sang Gyeong will pick.

1085
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,320
Number 24, Lee Sang Gyeong.

1086
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:02,860
Sang Gyeong.

1087
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:04,630
(Time for Sang Gyeong to deliver his vote.)

1088
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:06,300
It's Sang Gyeong's turn now.

1089
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,429
(Sang Gyeong's name is called, )

1090
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:10,899
(and Joo Hee has an ambiguous look on her face.)

1091
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,700
We'll see where his heart leads.

1092
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,499
Will it be Jin Ju or Joo Hee?

1093
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,639
(Jin Ju also has an ambiguous look on her face.)

1094
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,210
- Here he goes. - Here he goes!

1095
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,940
I started debating with myself again.

1096
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,309
Jin Ju...

1097
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:24,609
(He's torn between Joo Hee and Jin Ju.)

1098
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:25,780
and Joo Hee...

1099
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,180
Well, I'm not sure about either.

1100
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:32,249
- He's been through a lot. - Yes.

1101
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:35,820
Jin Ju and Joo Hee both never gave him any confirmation.

1102
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,530
This is really hard.

1103
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:42,359
He's going straight to one person. Who is he going to?

1104
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,699
He's going straight. Who is it?

1105
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:44,930
(What is Sang Gyeong's decision?)

1106
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,900
Who is it?

1107
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:53,480
There's nothing about Jin Ju that has me worried.

1108
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:56,709
I'm able to talk to her comfortably...

1109
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:58,979
as if we're in a relationship already.

1110
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:00,150
What is it?

1111
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,380
I'm trying to make up my mind.

1112
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:05,289
They've been so lovely, though.

1113
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:06,290
Right.

1114
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:09,890
(But Jae Keun showed up like a shooting star.)

1115
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:14,460
(She couldn't help but be attracted to him.)

1116
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:17,769
Jin Ju chose two men,

1117
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:19,900
so we couldn't go to the couple zone.

1118
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:22,570
But Joo Hee...

1119
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:27,710
(She decided to go all in for Jae Yeon.)

1120
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,479
Did you choose him because you felt bad?

1121
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:32,910
He's constantly showed me his loyalty.

1122
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:34,320
But I...

1123
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:37,289
(He was sad about her decision.)

1124
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:39,290
- So, what happened? - What happened?

1125
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:42,159
Who is it?

1126
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,589
(Sang Gyeong chooses...)

1127
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:47,299
- Thank you. - No way!

1128
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,459
(It was Joo Hee.)

1129
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:49,930
He chose Joo Hee!

1130
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:53,070
Sang Gyeong chose Joo Hee.

1131
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:55,569
(Sang Gyeong's decision...)

1132
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:57,540
(shocks all the women.)

1133
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:00,610
What...

1134
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,210
- Look at her face! - Gosh.

1135
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:12,889
I see.

1136
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:14,920
I didn't have a conversation with him today, but...

1137
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:16,190
Oh, no.

1138
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,790
Yes.

1139
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:20,060
Jin Ju said...

1140
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:23,370
something about wanting to visit my clinic.

1141
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:26,170
There's an advantage. Discounts at the dermatology clinic.

1142
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:27,940
Can I get free treatment?

1143
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,240
Well...

1144
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,970
I'll go to your clinic for treatment.

1145
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:32,870
Turn me into Jang Won Young.

1146
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:35,279
Do I have to be reborn?

1147
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,350
No, that's not it.

1148
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,380
Make me pretty like Won Young.

1149
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,920
- I see. - Oh, boy.

1150
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,349
She keeps saying she'll come to my clinic.

1151
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:45,719
The words are nice to hear.

1152
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,259
But I want to hear that she likes me.

1153
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:50,160
This is a relationship between two people, right?

1154
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,989
She should be into me as a person,

1155
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:53,429
not my career.

1156
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:55,359
That's what I wanted to hear from her.

1157
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,370
I see.

1158
00:49:57,970 --> 00:49:59,469
(Joo Hee liked Sang Gyeong as a person...)

1159
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:02,140
(and never held back on expressing it.)

1160
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:06,069
(That's why I like you.)

1161
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:08,039
- Expressing things is important. - It is.

1162
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,350
He just wanted to hear her say that she liked him.

1163
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:14,349
Nice words come out when you're actually into them.

1164
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:16,790
Even I say, "I like her. She's pretty."

1165
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:20,420
And the person who actually said those was Joo Hee.

1166
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:23,889
Joo Hee got three votes now.

1167
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:27,029
That means she has to pick one of the three tomorrow.

1168
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:28,060
That's true.

1169
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:32,099
Jin Ju was torn...

1170
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:33,800
between Sang Gyeong and Jae Keun,

1171
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,769
but she found out that Sang Gyeong has changed his mind.

1172
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:36,770
- Yes. - Exactly.

1173
00:50:36,771 --> 00:50:37,909
I wonder how she feels.

1174
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:38,910
(How does she feel right now?)

1175
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:43,010
The final proposal vote has ended.

1176
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,780
You need to get a grip.

1177
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:52,390
I had a mental breakdown.

1178
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:55,420
He suddenly gave his card to someone else.

1179
00:50:55,990 --> 00:50:57,830
"She doesn't seem so sure about me these days."

1180
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,329
"And this girl says she likes me."

1181
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:01,460
"Then, I choose you."

1182
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,300
I didn't know he was that shallow.

1183
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,569
Jin Ju must feel betrayed.

1184
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:07,600
Yes.

1185
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:10,810
How did Number 24 end up choosing you?

1186
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:13,039
Did something happen?

1187
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,310
We clicked when we talked.

1188
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,880
You should choose him, then.

1189
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:19,450
Because you've been into him the whole time.

1190
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:24,520
But I already said that I'd only go for Number Seven.

1191
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:26,590
But look how it turned out.

1192
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:28,490
This is driving me insane.

1193
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:31,359
Joo Hee already told Jae Yeon...

1194
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,859
that she'd only go for him.

1195
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:33,860
I know.

1196
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:37,729
The look on Jin Ju's face.

1197
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:39,800
(Jin Ju seems anxious for some reason.)

1198
00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:43,309
I wonder what Joo Hee said to him out there.

1199
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:45,839
How did he change his mind so suddenly?

1200
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:48,010
If you ask a man to vote for you...

1201
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:50,550
right before the final decision, he might waver.

1202
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:54,079
But Joo Hee is right next to them.

1203
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,120
Tell me about it.

1204
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:58,890
That was a cheap move.

1205
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,990
I'm disappointed in her.

1206
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:03,460
So, the chats you have today are critical.

1207
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:06,760
You need to have a deep conversation with the person you like.

1208
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:08,059
That's true.

1209
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:09,730
I should be more aggressive.

1210
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:13,969
But I could have given Sang Gyeong a conviction.

1211
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:16,070
I could have, but I didn't.

1212
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:18,469
But I bet...

1213
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:20,739
- she kept telling him. - Yes.

1214
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:22,439
But Joo Hee...

1215
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:26,720
must be really attractive to make that happen.

1216
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:29,180
I can imagine how she did it, though.

1217
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:31,690
You can always get votes from men...

1218
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:34,219
by going, "I'm going to pick you."

1219
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:35,959
"You're so handsome."

1220
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:38,160
But I didn't want to get the votes that way.

1221
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:40,600
I need to use the bathroom.

1222
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:46,230
(Joo Hee leaves the room for a moment.)

1223
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,199
You see,

1224
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,370
I came to talk with Number 24 today.

1225
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:53,979
But is there a need to?

1226
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:55,609
- No. - Don't do it?

1227
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:58,949
I don't want him to think of me as the clingy type.

1228
00:52:58,950 --> 00:52:59,980
- Jin Ju. - But...

1229
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,320
It's not being clingy.

1230
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:08,519
I've never brought it up to Number 24 until now...

1231
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,790
that I'd pick him. I acted like I wouldn't pick him.

1232
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:13,300
That was why he chose Number 18.

1233
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,829
Did it end up like, "You're not picking me?"

1234
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:17,499
"Then I'm picking someone else."

1235
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,700
No. Either way,

1236
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:22,240
he only chose you yesterday.

1237
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,440
But you chose two men. Starting then,

1238
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:26,979
he thought you two could move up to the couple zone.

1239
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:29,839
But you two didn't. That completely ruined his mood.

1240
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,710
Men get hurt too.

1241
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:34,619
He was depressed from getting hurt, but you...

1242
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:36,249
- I didn't make it obvious. - You didn't,

1243
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:38,090
- and neither made him feel assured. - True.

1244
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:39,590
I was going to tell him today.

1245
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:42,689
But that was from yesterday night...

1246
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:45,289
to the evening of today.

1247
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:47,700
- Yes. - And many things happened.

1248
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:50,200
Imagine how anxious he must've been.

1249
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:52,599
- You're right. - It's...

1250
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:55,370
How do I put it? There's no need to let it upset you.

1251
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,539
So...

1252
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:58,569
Seung Yeon is good with words, isn't she?

1253
00:53:58,570 --> 00:53:59,710
She's very articulate.

1254
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:03,209
It has always been him.

1255
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:05,210
I simply didn't mention it to him.

1256
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:07,120
But to have voted for someone else?

1257
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:10,549
Regardless of his intention,

1258
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:13,090
it hurt me quite a bit and let me down.

1259
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:17,130
(Sang Gyeong voted Joo Hee as his final proposal partner.)

1260
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,059
Sang Gyeong has made his decision...

1261
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:21,429
but looks worried.

1262
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:23,700
Everything has become a mess.

1263
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:25,300
It's wild in there.

1264
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:28,639
I'm sorry, but do you have a comb?

1265
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,740
A comb?

1266
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,340
I don't.

1267
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:33,610
- I'll ask the others myself. - Okay.

1268
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:37,210
Who are you taking?

1269
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:38,350
What?

1270
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:40,819
The two are waiting over there.

1271
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:41,820
I see.

1272
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:44,719
Jae Yeon thinks Sang Gyeong and Jae Keun...

1273
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,319
voted for Jin Ju.

1274
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,689
- It seems like it. - He thinks the two voted for her.

1275
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:50,830
- Just stay still. - Stay still.

1276
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:53,799
The two are waiting over there.

1277
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:54,830
I see.

1278
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:57,530
But to be honest,

1279
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,500
everything is meaningless.

1280
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:04,540
Is that so? I don't know who voted for who.

1281
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:07,880
Either way, I always talked about Number 24.

1282
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:10,110
I thought he'd vote for me.

1283
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:14,880
Little did I expect his mind to change today.

1284
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:17,820
(Jae Yeon doesn't understand what Jin Ju is talking about.)

1285
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:21,020
He voted for Number 18 and left with a gloomy face.

1286
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:30,670
I had no idea.

1287
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:32,930
I really had no idea.

1288
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:35,039
- To think that's what happened. - Today...

1289
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,170
(Jae Yeon didn't expect Sang Gyeong to choose Joo Hee.)

1290
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,669
All right, now, I'm...

1291
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:40,680
(He's feeling anxious.)

1292
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:42,909
I'm going to go find Joo Hee now.

1293
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:44,010
Off you go.

1294
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:46,210
- I'm leaving. - Bye.

1295
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:51,020
Jae Yeon wants to get a hold of Joo Hee's wavering heart.

1296
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:53,960
Joo Hee. Let's talk. Come here.

1297
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:57,930
- I just heard it. - Heard what?

1298
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,130
- That you got a vote. - I did.

1299
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:03,699
- I got it from three people. - Exactly.

1300
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:05,629
Do the men not know about it?

1301
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:08,800
I found out after talking with Jin Ju just now.

1302
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:12,640
I thought everyone knew.

1303
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:21,480
How did it end up like this?

1304
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,050
Just how? How did this happen?

1305
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:29,920
(Jae Yeon feels bad for Joo Hee, who is struggling.)

1306
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:31,960
- But... - Yes?

1307
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:38,030
- To be frank, - Yes?

1308
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:41,400
- I told you I'd go for you. - Right.

1309
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:47,110
But if it feels like my heart is wavering...

1310
00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:50,280
Like how?

1311
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:57,220
If my heart is wavering because of Number 24,

1312
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:03,190
I don't know if it's right for me to choose you.

1313
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:09,030
If you were...

1314
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:14,840
in my situation,

1315
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:18,040
I doubt you would've wavered.

1316
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:23,550
But me wavering is...

1317
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:28,820
I told you not to feel bad about it.

1318
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:50,210
I didn't do much for you except wait. That's why...

1319
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:53,409
I did nothing to impress you.

1320
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:56,110
(Jae Yeon waited for Joo Hee without putting any pressure on her.)

1321
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:00,180
There was nothing else I could do.

1322
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:10,790
There was nothing else I could do.

1323
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:21,300
(Getting too emotional, Jae Yeon leaves Joo Hee's side.)

1324
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:26,409
I think I've made up my mind.

1325
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:27,940
- Really? - Yes.

1326
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,840
It was so hard to hear that.

1327
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:34,519
(She gave him certainty this morning.)

1328
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:37,950
My feelings for her grew a lot more than I expected.

1329
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,389
It was very upsetting.

1330
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:44,590
(But she said her heart was wavering.)

1331
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,800
I feel terrible for him.

1332
00:58:57,970 --> 00:59:00,780
He must've mustered up a lot of courage,

1333
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:03,850
but not being able to return his feelings is...

1334
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:12,149
It's not like your feelings can be definite,

1335
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:13,290
which makes it harder.

1336
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,159
Joo Hee must be in a pinch.

1337
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:17,089
I can't guess what kind of a decision...

1338
00:59:17,090 --> 00:59:18,359
she'll make.

1339
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:19,430
Same here.

1340
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:24,129
(Jin Ju heads somewhere looking for someone.)

1341
00:59:24,130 --> 00:59:26,200
- What? - Where is she going?

1342
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:30,970
(Where is she heading to?)

1343
00:59:31,210 --> 00:59:33,370
(Jin Ju has come to the men's lounge.)

1344
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,579
What are you doing facing each other?

1345
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:38,009
I'd like to talk to him.

1346
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:39,380
- Is that okay? - Of course.

1347
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:43,080
I thought we should share what was on our minds.

1348
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,849
- At least, I wanted to. - Okay.

1349
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:46,750
- It has no other special meaning. - Got it.

1350
00:59:47,090 --> 00:59:49,559
We wanted to talk since yesterday.

1351
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:52,259
- True. - But our timing was off.

1352
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:53,260
(Joo Hee spots the two together.)

1353
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:56,430
Oh, no. Joo Hee saw the two.

1354
00:59:57,070 --> 00:59:58,830
I wanted...

1355
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:02,369
to say what was on my mind before we end it.

1356
01:00:02,370 --> 01:00:03,839
End it or whatever.

1357
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:05,509
- Shall we talk here? - Okay.

1358
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:07,310
(What did Jin Ju want to say?)

1359
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,780
Ever since coming here and until this morning,

1360
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:14,350
it has always been you.

1361
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:15,850
But...

1362
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:19,320
I had no idea it'd end up like this.

1363
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:21,320
I never thought you'd change your mind...

1364
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,660
just because we couldn't talk.

1365
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:26,690
After the vote last night,

1366
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,700
I got the wrong idea about you.

1367
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:33,769
- If I were to explain about that... - But I...

1368
01:00:33,770 --> 01:00:35,139
I get your intention.

1369
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:36,669
Rather than you actually voting for her,

1370
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:39,410
you were telling me that "I'm over you."

1371
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:41,780
It wasn't that kind of a protest.

1372
01:00:43,110 --> 01:00:46,649
Actually, I get greedy too.

1373
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:48,220
- True. - And my greed was...

1374
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:50,590
being told things.

1375
01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:52,149
Like simple things.

1376
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:54,559
"It'll still be you. I won't waver. It'll always be you."

1377
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:56,419
Or something like, "You're cool."

1378
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:59,629
Words that you'd say from watching me.

1379
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:03,660
I get the feeling I wanted to hear those things.

1380
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,170
Our relationship moving forward without any of those...

1381
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:11,409
felt like you were only getting to know me and not dating me.

1382
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:12,540
I see.

1383
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,579
The compliments I wanted to hear.

1384
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:21,650
- Right. - She's good at it.

1385
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:22,780
I know.

1386
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:26,450
She says them to me directly.

1387
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:32,930
I couldn't help but constantly remember them.

1388
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:37,870
It ended there.

1389
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:44,340
(And so, Sang Gyeong and Jin Ju have ended.)

1390
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:49,280
Number 24 was a great person.

1391
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:52,649
My feelings for Number Three were the same as those...

1392
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:54,219
I had for my ex-boyfriend.

1393
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:57,220
But Number 24 already felt like my husband.

1394
01:01:57,590 --> 01:01:59,290
Do you want to know something funny?

1395
01:01:59,350 --> 01:02:01,590
When Number 24 laughed,

1396
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:03,760
his mouth looked huge.

1397
01:02:05,490 --> 01:02:10,200
"Can someone change this quickly?" was what I thought.

1398
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:14,240
I couldn't help but think his mouth was huge and wide.

1399
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,799
"What's this? Why does his lips look plump?"

1400
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,009
(Denying reality)

1401
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:19,440
I was like that.

1402
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:21,840
She's still greatly attached to him.

1403
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:23,609
By saying things like that and such...

1404
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:27,519
Jin Ju is preparing to move on...

1405
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:28,820
from Sang Gyeong.

1406
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:31,520
His mouth looking big was funny.

1407
01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:33,089
I thought it was hilarious.

1408
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:37,130
Anyway, my ideal type is someone...

1409
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:39,160
who isn't small-minded.

1410
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:42,800
I don't like someone who is small-minded.

1411
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:45,199
I like people with a big heart.

1412
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,600
Not that I'm saying he has a small heart.

1413
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,509
(Joo Hee walks into the women's lounge.)

1414
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:51,570
Joo Hee is walking in.

1415
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:54,909
But...

1416
01:02:54,910 --> 01:02:56,179
(She sits down where she's used to, passing by Jin Ju and Jae Na.)

1417
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:57,450
There's slight tension.

1418
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:59,610
I don't know. It's just...

1419
01:03:02,050 --> 01:03:03,050
I just...

1420
01:03:03,850 --> 01:03:06,320
He said he voted for someone else and not me,

1421
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:11,860
not because he had feelings for that person,

1422
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:17,129
but to show me...

1423
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:18,770
he was moving on.

1424
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,270
(During their talk 10 minutes ago)

1425
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:23,799
(She thought the vote for Joo Hee...)

1426
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,740
(was him being conscious of her.)

1427
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:30,950
(But Sang Gyeong had denied it.)

1428
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:36,880
(But Jin Ju says the opposite.)

1429
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,120
So...

1430
01:03:38,121 --> 01:03:40,920
(Now Joo Hee got the wrong idea.)

1431
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,059
He voted for someone else...

1432
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:45,289
because it was emotionally draining,

1433
01:03:45,290 --> 01:03:47,930
because I wasn't assuring him.

1434
01:03:52,970 --> 01:03:53,970
Did you talk with him?

1435
01:03:53,971 --> 01:03:55,200
(Nodding)

1436
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:01,410
- Why are you withering away? - Right.

1437
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:02,980
Didn't you decide?

1438
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:05,109
- Didn't you? - I heard you decided.

1439
01:04:05,110 --> 01:04:06,249
I did.

1440
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:08,620
Do you feel bad, or is your heart wavering?

1441
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:10,790
I feel bad.

1442
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:14,890
And I hate myself for wavering.

1443
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:16,989
It's not polyandry.

1444
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:18,559
In the end, you must choose one.

1445
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,430
Those men knew that while voting for you.

1446
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:23,000
(Joo Hee has a lot on her mind now.)

1447
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:26,599
There's been another misunderstanding.

1448
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:28,039
- Yes. - And a big one at that.

1449
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:30,569
- A grave one. - Joo Hee got deeply hurt...

1450
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:32,340
and is more confused now.

1451
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,649
(Joo Hee ends up crying alone.)

1452
01:04:37,650 --> 01:04:39,910
- Is she crying? - Oh, no.

1453
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:45,190
I'm stressed out right now.

1454
01:04:45,450 --> 01:04:46,450
That...

1455
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:51,130
The last conversation we had...

1456
01:04:51,990 --> 01:04:53,330
put a toll on my emotions.

1457
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:55,100
- Really? Why? - Yes, our last conversation...

1458
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:57,300
Our conversation just...

1459
01:04:58,330 --> 01:04:59,600
This is...

1460
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:06,270
This is really tough. I want...

1461
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:09,439
I want to ask you to give up on her.

1462
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,480
- Really? - Yes. I'm 100 percent sincere.

1463
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:16,850
I want to ask you to do it for me. It's just too much.

1464
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:18,990
I'm having a difficult time.

1465
01:05:20,990 --> 01:05:22,220
What...

1466
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:24,890
I'm not trying to be mean.

1467
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:30,430
I didn't want to go this far.

1468
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:34,900
It's too tough.

1469
01:05:37,470 --> 01:05:38,870
He really likes her.

1470
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:41,679
(Jae Yeon's tears...)

1471
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,009
(make Sang Gyeong tear up.)

1472
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:44,010
Hold on.

1473
01:05:44,450 --> 01:05:46,180
Seriously.

1474
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:49,820
- But he already voted for her. - Exactly.

1475
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:55,190
- I said it was tough because... - Yes?

1476
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:00,190
I had a traumatic experience.

1477
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:07,700
I had a traumatic experience.

1478
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:12,370
(What hurt Jae Yeon?)

1479
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:19,649
There used to be a girl I really liked.

1480
01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:20,650
Okay.

1481
01:06:23,550 --> 01:06:25,720
I thought the girl I liked...

1482
01:06:27,690 --> 01:06:31,160
and I had mutual feelings for each other.

1483
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:34,260
But she had a boyfriend.

1484
01:06:37,230 --> 01:06:39,469
So there was a reason Jae Yeon was stressed out.

1485
01:06:39,470 --> 01:06:42,300
The bad experience became a trauma,

1486
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:44,810
and the current situation overlaps with it.

1487
01:06:45,970 --> 01:06:47,210
But that girl...

1488
01:06:47,310 --> 01:06:49,640
You don't have to tell me.

1489
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:54,350
Don't bring up a painful past.

1490
01:06:56,350 --> 01:06:57,350
Okay.

1491
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:00,860
- I'm sorry. - No.

1492
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:05,589
- Don't let it get to you too much. - Okay.

1493
01:07:05,590 --> 01:07:06,590
It's okay.

1494
01:07:07,930 --> 01:07:08,930
It's okay.

1495
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:14,899
But I have this goal.

1496
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:16,400
I want to be...

1497
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:19,840
the last person she talks to.

1498
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:22,710
On the last day, at the last moment,

1499
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:24,680
I should be with her.

1500
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:31,149
(COUPLE PALACE)

1501
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:32,450
(The day of the final proposal)

1502
01:07:32,890 --> 01:07:35,289
(Would my life change from today?)

1503
01:07:35,290 --> 01:07:36,760
(My heart was pounding.)

1504
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:38,190
(The nerve-racking final proposal moment)

1505
01:07:38,390 --> 01:07:41,400
(Delivering their feelings with sincerity)

1506
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:42,830
(Let's go get married.)

1507
01:07:42,930 --> 01:07:44,060
(The love blossoms with blessings)

1508
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,500
(But...)

1509
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:46,600
(I couldn't feel...)

1510
01:07:46,601 --> 01:07:48,000
(your earnestness.)

1511
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:50,040
(Not all feelings can be reciprocated.)

1512
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:51,439
(I want to stay by your side.)

1513
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:52,609
(Ji Woong...)

1514
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:55,010
(doesn't seem the type to look only at me.)

1515
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:57,340
(I had no idea, but he had gone on a secret date.)

1516
01:07:57,810 --> 01:08:00,280
(Even before the final proposal, their hearts waver.)

1517
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:01,449
(For Jin Ju, )

1518
01:08:01,450 --> 01:08:03,350
(it has always been Sang Gyeong.)

1519
01:08:03,450 --> 01:08:05,150
(When it was always Number 24,)

1520
01:08:05,250 --> 01:08:06,420
(he felt like my virtual husband.)

1521
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:08,360
(Even on the wedding aisle, )

1522
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:10,590
(they don't know each other's feelings.)

1523
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:13,330
(And Joo Hee has yet to decide.)

1524
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:15,030
(I feel more assured now.)

1525
01:08:15,230 --> 01:08:16,900
(I don't want anyone to get hurt.)

1526
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:19,670
(Which man will Joo Hee choose?)

1527
01:08:19,770 --> 01:08:23,000
(And these two whom we thought would be a happy ending...)

1528
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:25,570
(I...)

1529
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:27,980
(How will it end?)
