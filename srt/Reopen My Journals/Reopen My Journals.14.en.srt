=Episode 14=

24
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,550
Xiu'e, come on. Have a seat.

25
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,480
Let me give you a massage.

26
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,500
I heard Yang Min

27
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,620
came back.

28
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:58,820
Zhang Qiming

29
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,220
is pretending to be sick.

30
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,660
Do you think

31
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,420
Yang Min will fall for it?

32
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,180
What's the matter?

33
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:11,820
Xiu'e,

34
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,380
are you feeling unwell?

35
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,980
I feel a little upset.

36
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,900
It's the 21st century now,

37
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,420
why are they still so backward

38
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,340
and so male-dominated?

39
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,500
I know

40
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,380
you've endured so much these days.

41
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:39,740
But don't use "backward"

42
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,060
so lightly.

43
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,820
It's not gender bias,

44
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,500
just division of labor.

45
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,780
Women handle housework,

46
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,300
and men work the fields.

47
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,780
It's just how things are.

48
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,180
In the village,

49
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,300
we fought for water and land,

50
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,860
men had to risk their lives.

51
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,100
So, it's fair

52
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,090
to let them rest at home.

53
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,340
In rural areas,
men are the muscle.

54
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,060
Having a man

55
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,500
means more help.

56
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,660
We can't apply city standards

57
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,100
to rural life.

58
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,820
But how come

59
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,220
boys can attend school

60
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,580
and not to work,

61
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,740
while girls must drop out

62
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,380
and work?

63
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,060
Explain it to me.

64
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,700
Who will drop out?

65
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,460
Just now Baby said

66
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,860
your family won't let Jiali
continue her studies.

67
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,620
Your siblings

68
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,260
only let Qian Weihao
to go to college.

69
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,460
For Lin's family,

70
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,380
to pay for both kids to go to college

71
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,740
is too big a burden.

72
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,380
You know, Qian Kang,

73
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,580
I resent how my mom said

74
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,420
it was for my brother,

75
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,260
and forced me
to go to the countryside.

76
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,100
I'll never forgive her in my life.

77
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:52,940
Xiu'e,

78
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,580
why bring this up again?

79
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,580
If you hadn't come,

80
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,160
you would work at the No. 9 Factory,

81
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,460
you'd be laid off anyway,

82
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,540
right?

83
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,700
You wouldn't have met me.

84
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,900
If you didn't meet me,

85
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,380
how could we have Baby?

86
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,060
What nonsense!

87
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,380
That's just twisted logic.

88
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,860
It's not twisted logic.

89
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,260
I just want you to know

90
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,980
that people have their fate.

91
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,580
Don't overthink it.

92
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,220
What do you mean by fate?

93
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,860
So my mom treats me like that

94
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,380
is what I deserve

95
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,380
and is my fate?

96
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,700
Jiali can't go to school

97
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,780
is good for her

98
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,300
and is her fate,

99
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,260
right?

100
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,900
Let me massage your back.

101
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,820
Don't touch me. So annoying.

102
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,900
Honey,

103
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,420
let's head back early.

104
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,260
Out of sight, out of mind.

105
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,380
Besides, Baby said

106
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,700
she finds it quite boring here.

107
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,580
She wants to celebrate Xiao Han's birthday.

108
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,420
Let's leave on the fifth day.

109
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,940
How can we leave that early?

110
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,300
We agreed on the seventh day!

111
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,740
I say in the fifth day!

112
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,020
I'll get some water,

113
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:26,900
and give you a foot massage.

114
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,700
(Puyang New Village)

115
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,820
Watch out.

116
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,100
(Jiale Wontons)

117
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,220
I'm sorry

118
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,460
to keep you waiting.

119
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,300
It's alright. Get in.

120
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,140
Okay, okay.

121
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,300
I'm all sweaty from running.

122
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,340
With your condition,
how are you running?

123
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,820
I'm recovering…

124
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,740
recovering well.

125
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,140
The doctor says it's going well.

126
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,740
You can visit the Cancer Support Club.

127
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,580
I read in the newspaper

128
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,790
that many people with cancer

129
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,900
run marathons.

130
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,060
Sir, let's go.

131
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,140
You said you have

132
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,700
stomach cancer?

133
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,140
Which stage is it?

134
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:55,780
Early stage.

135
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,060
Different places have different terms.

136
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,540
Last time you mentioned

137
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,540
a life-saving medicine,
but it's hard to find,

138
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,780
only available abroad.

139
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,740
What's it called again?

140
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,180
I can buy some and

141
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,100
send it to you.

142
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,300
I don't understand English.

143
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,700
I don't even know my ABC.

144
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,940
I only know pinyin.

145
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,780
You...

146
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,140
Maybe it's Leike or something.

147
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,700
The foreign names are too complex.

148
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,060
I'll check it out later.

149
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,780
So hard to get.

150
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,380
Let me know once you find out.

151
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,100
Alright.

152
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,660
Sir, this isn't the way
to the Civil Affairs Bureau.

153
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,180
Come on, bro.

154
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,100
You're taking me in circles.

155
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,160
I'm gonna file a complaint!

156
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,140
Well...

157
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,740
You guys decide.

158
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,420
The lady told me this way.

159
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,820
Stop yelling.

160
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,060
He's not wrong.

161
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,860
I'm taking you to the hospital.

162
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,860
I have a friend

163
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,260
whose elder brother

164
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,780
is a tumor expert.

165
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,780
I'll take you to see him.

166
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,780
I don't wanna see a doctor.

167
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,100
My doctor

168
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,460
is good.

169
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,980
I trust him greatly.

170
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,740
You're ridiculous.

171
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,380
Come on, Doctor Liu

172
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,540
is truly amazing.

173
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,180
He's the best for stomach cancer

174
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,860
in Shanghai.

175
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,100
His specialist appointment
is impossible to get.

176
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,260
He agreed to see you

177
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,020
for my sake.

178
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,300
It's too sudden!

179
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,500
I didn't bring anything.

180
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,460
My medical records, my CT scans.

181
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,460
What should I say to him?

182
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,020
Prices for spinach?

183
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,140
You are truly ridiculous.

184
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,380
It's okay, just see him,

185
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,900
so he can check your condition.

186
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,740
That's all.

187
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,060
I'm fine!

188
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,700
I'm feel great.

189
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,580
You have cancer.

190
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,420
Cancer is not small stuff.

191
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,940
If the cancer spreads,

192
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,860
you could lose your life.

193
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,500
You're still young.

194
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,820
I won't go.

195
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:49,940
How about this?

196
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,100
If you don't want
to talk about your condition,

197
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,740
you can talk about other topics.

198
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,580
For example,

199
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,900
the Marriage Law,

200
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,260
how to divide property

201
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,140
after divorce,

202
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,980
anything you like.

203
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,860
When did you figure it out?

204
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,340
Before you got my letter,

205
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,460
I'm already back.

206
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,580
I went back home

207
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,540
to visit my mother,

208
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,900
then went to find you.

209
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,460
At the New Village gate,

210
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,460
I saw you

211
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,820
laughing

212
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,580
with Aiping.

213
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,300
That's when I knew

214
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,900
you weren't sick,

215
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,580
you just want a divorce.

216
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:54,100
This woman is

217
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,660
quite something.

218
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,900
You set a trap for me

219
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,100
and played me like a fool.

220
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,860
Acting with me yesterday.

221
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,540
I'm cooperating.

222
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,700
You don't need to do that.

223
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,580
You just wanted a divorce.

224
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,180
So did I.

225
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,140
Why pretend to be sick?

226
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,980
I've thought it through.

227
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,740
I'll compensate you.

228
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,940
Take a look at this.

229
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,700
If there's anything to add or change,

230
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,900
just let me know.

231
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,060
Party A: Yang Min.

232
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,820
Party B: Zhang Qiming.

233
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,780
Both Parties reached an agreement

234
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,440
and amicably decided on a divorce.

235
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,980
Party A agrees to give Party B

236
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,020
100,000 yuan in cash as compensation.

237
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,860
As for the 100,000 yuan,

238
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,460
I'll give to you,

239
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,460
sick or not.

240
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,220
I know I owe you and our son too much.

241
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,190
The custody of Child Zhang Yang

242
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,740
(Child issue)
goes to Yang Min.

243
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,140
That's my only request.

244
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,780
Come on, sir,

245
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,940
please pull the car over.

246
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,020
If you are dissatisfied,

247
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,060
feel free to voice them.

248
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,580
Pull over.

249
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,060
Zhang Qiming, stop right there!

250
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,100
What's wrong with you,

251
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:29,940
huh?

252
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:33,940
Do you have any shame?

253
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,740
You're fighting me for custody?

254
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,340
I've done everything

255
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,260
to raise him,

256
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,300
being both Mom and Dad.

257
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,700
Now you want to take him?

258
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,740
In your dream.

259
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,740
I'm thinking about our son.

260
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,340
Now you care about him?

261
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,900
Impressive, truly impressive of you.

262
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,740
Impressive indeed!

263
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,740
Sir,

264
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,420
everyone, come and see.

265
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,900
Be our judge.

266
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,900
When our son's five, you went to Japan,

267
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,900
and danced

268
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,500
in a nightclub,

269
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,660
kissing

270
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,500
and hugging.

271
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,260
You forget you had a son then?

272
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,380
When he's seven, he got appendicitis,

273
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,540
writhing in pain,

274
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,300
and crying,

275
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:08,860
"Where's my mom?"

276
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,260
"Where did she go?"

277
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,460
Where are you then?

278
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,700
Grade 3,

279
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,940
a fatty said he's motherless.

280
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,180
He beat the kid up.

281
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,180
That kid just stands there

282
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,060
while our son crying his heart out.

283
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:21,900
Where were you then?

284
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,620
Now you want him?

285
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,500
Is there any justice here?

286
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,820
Is it fair?

287
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,340
I came back to see him,

288
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,580
- but you didn't let me.
- Yes.

289
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,780
I didn't let you him,

290
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,140
because you are not worthy.

291
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,940
I know you hate me,

292
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,140
but you can't let that

293
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,540
ruin our son's future.

294
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,060
I'll take him to Japan

295
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,860
and find him a better school,

296
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,260
give him the best education.

297
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,100
I can give him a better life.

298
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,460
The best school, the best education,

299
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,300
a better life.

300
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,500
Now you're talking about money?

301
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,340
Let me tell you.

302
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,700
I've got money too.

303
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,540
I'm wealthy now.

304
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,260
Money's just paper.

305
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,860
I'm going all out today.

306
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,540
Divorce splits the property in half.

307
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,660
Fine, split it.

308
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,180
Everyone fights for pride.

309
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,460
Now, I've got money.

310
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,380
I'm a big boss now.

311
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,180
My son lives well with me.

312
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,740
Go to Japan with you?

313
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,600
You think you're so great?

314
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,140
If he wants to go abroad,

315
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,900
whether it's the USA, Australia, or the UK,

316
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,940
he makes the decision.

317
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,860
I can hang a world map on the wall,

318
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,820
wherever the dart lands,
I'll send him there.

319
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,940
With you in Japan?

320
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,180
Keep dreaming!

321
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,620
Why are you laughing?
I'm not bragging.

322
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,060
Everything I said is true.

323
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,180
The Montagut suits,

324
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,740
two thousand each, I have two.

325
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,260
I usually drive a Benz.

326
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,860
Portman on Nanjing Road?

327
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,460
I talk business there.

328
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,660
Alright, little brother,

329
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,220
enough already.

330
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,460
Go home and talk it out.

331
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,860
This is embarrassing.

332
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,820
What's embarrassing?

333
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,700
Do you know Mr. Bao of Shanghai?

334
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,540
Boss Bao on Huanghe Road.

335
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,980
I do business with him.

336
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,660
I won't talk to you.

337
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,900
I'll call your brother

338
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,020
and give him my address.

339
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,740
Come over tonight and see

340
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,580
our life now.

341
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,500
I don't care what life you're living.

342
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,060
I only want my son.

343
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,780
Goodbye to you.

344
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,540
You're taking him?

345
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,340
Let's go. Let's go.

346
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,700
Hey, sir.

347
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,900
You can take the wallet,

348
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,860
but give me my ID and bank cards.

349
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,860
How much is in here?

350
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,700
Give me two yuan.

351
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,540
I'll take the bus.

352
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,220
Come on.

353
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,060
He only has forty-something yuan.

354
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,260
Don't pretend you're rich.

355
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,140
Flaunting wealth.

356
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,380
Come on.

357
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,700
Blind to the big spender in front of you.

358
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,540
What a fool.

359
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,820
She's trying to fight me for custody.

360
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:53,900
Let her dream on.

361
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,460
A pipe dream!

362
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,940
Even Buddha values glory.

363
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,980
Every man has his pride.

364
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,340
Aiping, I have decided.

365
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,240
I'll be frank with her.

366
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,580
I'll show her

367
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,860
how well we are living now.

368
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,260
I'll call her in a bit

369
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,940
let her meet at Portman tomorrow.

370
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,860
You all have to help me.

371
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,540
Qiming.

372
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,660
Qiming, calm down.

373
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,620
Sit down first.

374
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,820
Calm yourself.

375
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:16,940
I...

376
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,140
I am very calm.

377
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,740
Aiping, Han,

378
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,300
you both go tomorrow.

379
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,860
The four of us

380
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,700
will go

381
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,700
all together.

382
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,620
Well,

383
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,220
I have computer training tomorrow.

384
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,460
I can't make it.

385
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,740
Qiming,

386
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,060
I shouldn't go either.

387
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,860
You should talk it out

388
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,780
with Yang Min

389
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,700
calmly and reasonably.

390
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,780
How can I talk to her calmly?

391
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,060
You didn't see her attitude.

392
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,180
"I'm taking my son."

393
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,860
What a joke?

394
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,460
She thinks I will trade my son for money?

395
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,580
Mao Tou, listen.

396
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,100
Don't be fooled by her sweet words

397
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,220
or her sugar-coated promises.

398
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,380
Whatever you want,

399
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,500
just tell me.

400
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,140
Don't miss this opportunity.

401
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,240
I'll fulfill your wishes.

402
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,660
I'm good either way.

403
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,260
You guys decide.

404
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,780
Little imp, you…

405
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,020
Mao Tou.

406
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,060
Be clear with your attitude.

407
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:35,940
Look at you.

408
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,580
You overreacting.

409
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,340
Am I?

410
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,300
I'm just stating the facts.

411
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:24,300
(First Canteen)

412
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,660
Mao Tou.

413
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,020
Mao Tou.

414
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:34,940
Brother Xiao Han.

415
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,300
Was it Thunderbird

416
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,260
that you were playing?

417
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,740
Show me.

418
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,580
I want to have a go.

419
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,700
This game is

420
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,060
pretty simple.

421
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,940
Just avoid bullets.

422
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,820
This is directions,

423
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,780
and this is attack.

424
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,420
You try.

425
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,260
Let me see.

426
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,780
Well…

427
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,300
so how do I make my plane stronger?

428
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,460
You just

429
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,020
eat the equipment

430
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,220
and it makes you stronger.

431
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,940
You're cutting cucumbers.

432
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,180
The wild ones smell so good,

433
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,400
I can smell them from afar.

434
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,740
You don't get them in Shanghai.

435
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,700
Xiu'e,

436
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,720
let me do it.

437
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,940
Be careful not to cut yourself.

438
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,260
I'll handle it.

439
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,580
Give it to me.

440
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,220
Kang, you're here too.

441
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,180
Such fresh vegetables.

442
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,780
- They're homegrown.
- Later,

443
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,860
stir-fry cucumber with eggs.

444
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,020
I'll make it later.

445
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,340
Alright, you go ahead.

446
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,100
Jiali,

447
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,380
I heard from your aunt…

448
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,220
Jiali.

449
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,020
- Kang.
- Sister.

450
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,500
Jiali,

451
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,100
your brother only has
one white school uniform.

452
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,620
Look, it's all stained!

453
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,260
Now I have to buy him a new one.

454
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,540
Such a troublemaker.

455
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,580
Jiali is quite good.

456
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,420
It's New Year's,

457
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,380
don't scold her.

458
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:25,940
Kang,

459
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,180
she's grown up now,

460
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,360
and can't even wash
her brother's clothes properly.

461
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,740
Wash it again.

462
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,060
No need to put on it.

463
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,420
Just drape it like this.

464
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,900
More impressive this way.

465
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,420
Look,

466
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,300
we can be on TV.

467
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,540
♪Waves surge and flow♪

468
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,420
♪The vast river never rests♪

469
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,620
Right?

470
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,780
You don't know how foolish
I looked before.

471
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,100
I thought Yang Min felt sorry for us

472
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,500
and gave 100,000 without hesitation.

473
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,340
Now I get it.

474
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,060
In her heart, only worth 100,000.

475
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,180
I gathered a bunch of documents.

476
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,420
I'll take them to Portman later

477
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,940
and show her everything.

478
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,180
Who's there?

479
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,820
Coming!

480
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:20,980
Aiping.

481
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,380
Great to see you!

482
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,340
I knew you'd come.

483
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,460
Listen,

484
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,420
I bought perfume.

485
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,860
Let's spray some on

486
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,340
before we go to Portman.

487
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:29,540
It'll cloud her senses.

488
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,540
Let me spray some on you.

489
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,620
Qiming, hold on.

490
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,820
I'm not here to go with you.

491
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,380
I've been thinking.

492
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,140
You'd better

493
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,660
not take Mao Tou there.

494
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,580
What if you both get emotional

495
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,820
and argue in front of him?

496
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,420
That won't be good for him.

497
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:45,780
Mao Tou,

498
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,140
do you want to go or not?

499
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,580
Why are you here?

500
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,220
Didn't we agree
to meet at Portman?

501
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,380
I think these things,

502
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,700
we better discuss at home.

503
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,340
Hello, Aiping.

504
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,460
Hi, Yang Min.

505
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,460
Well, then,

506
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,500
I'll leave you to it.

507
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,820
Founder
of Qimingxing Global Trading Co., Ltd.

508
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,560
Me, Zhang Qiming.

509
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,740
This property is under my name and his name.

510
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,460
Our company's business license.

511
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,260
In Xujiahui, Shanghai.

512
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,580
That photo is too small?

513
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,420
Here's a bigger one.

514
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,400
(Founder: Zhang Qiming)
Look.

515
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,220
The founder is Zhang Qiming.

516
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,580
Our business is now

517
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,660
covering all of China.

518
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,540
We've even expanded abroad.

519
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,300
This year, we entered the French market.

520
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,240
Have you been to France?

521
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,500
Have you seen the Eiffel Tower?

522
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,100
Why are you so worked up?

523
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,060
When you get anxious,

524
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,180
you just ramble on and on.

525
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:17,940
I know.

526
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:19,740
I understand everything.

527
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,860
Your business is doing well.

528
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,460
You didn't lie to me.

529
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,220
The house, car, factory,

530
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,420
and the company are all yours.

531
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:27,940
As you should.

532
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,220
Aiping, who just left,

533
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,020
back then, when our factory

534
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:32,540
selected the Factory Belle,

535
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,100
she ranked first, and you ranked fifth.

536
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,300
Out of jealousy,

537
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,740
you hid her thermos.

538
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,180
After we divorce,

539
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,820
I'll marry her immediately if she will.

540
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,860
Well, that's great then!

541
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,700
Congratulations then!

542
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,180
Thanks a bunch!

543
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,420
So, you see?

544
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,900
Am I living a good life?

545
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,180
Is my son

546
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,420
having a good time with me?

547
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,340
We are living very well.

548
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,260
Qiming,

549
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,300
since you're starting

550
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,940
a new happy life,

551
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,180
maybe you could consider

552
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,580
giving me custody of our son?

553
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,500
Out of question.

554
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,660
Don't even think about it.

555
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,740
Why are you so worked up?

556
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,780
Can't you let me finish?

557
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,940
He's your son, and my son too,

558
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,220
my biological son.

559
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,180
Could you give me a chance

560
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,820
to make it up to him?

561
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,940
I'll take him to Japan,

562
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,540
and give him good education
and a good life.

563
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,620
Isn't that great?

564
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,340
Besides, I know

565
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,060
Aiping also has a son.

566
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:28,740
After I take my son away,

567
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,100
they should be the happiest.

568
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,020
Do you think everyone's like you?

569
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,260
You keep saying it's for Mao Tou's sake,

570
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,360
but have you ever asked him

571
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,260
if he agrees?

572
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,740
He doesn't want to see you.

573
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,580
He slammed the door.

574
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:50,900
Mao Tou,

575
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,300
I know I've been wrong.

576
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,700
But I hope you can understand.

577
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,540
I went to Japan

578
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,860
only to improve

579
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,900
our living condition,

580
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,380
so you could live better.

581
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,980
Now that I'm capable…

582
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,580
Stop acting like a loving mother.

583
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,460
You say it's for Mao Tou,

584
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,540
but ask yourself,

585
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,860
did you go to Japan for Mao Tou?

586
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,940
Can you stop driving a wedge
between us?

587
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,580
Drive a wedge how?

588
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:15,940
What did I do?

589
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:16,960
He didn't want to see you,

590
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,860
I tried to persuade him

591
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,940
that you are his mom.

592
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,460
- Ask him out then.
- I tried to help.

593
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,100
Are you kidding me?

594
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,140
Why should I listen to you?

595
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,620
- Who do you think you are?
- Enough!

596
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:29,780
What's it all for?

597
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,380
You're fighting,

598
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,660
and you're fighting too.

599
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,140
Am I an object?

600
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,660
Have you considered my feelings?

601
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,740
Have you?

602
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,220
Little imp, no crying!

603
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,980
Zhang Qiming, don't yell at my son.

604
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,390
You are not worthy to be his mother.

605
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,500
Hey.

606
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,140
Is Qian Jiayue there?

607
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,340
Mao Tou?

608
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,380
It's me.

609
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,620
What's up?

610
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,700
No...

611
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,660
nothing.

612
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:25,900
Where are you?

613
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:29,220
I'm…

614
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,780
I'm outside.

615
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:32,820
So…

616
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,860
did you see your mom?

617
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,820
Mao Tou?

618
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,780
Lately,

619
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,500
I've been thinking.

620
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:54,980
What if

621
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,660
we could go back to
when we were kids?

622
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,140
When we were kids?

623
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,900
I remember back then,

624
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,420
every morning when I woke up,

625
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,580
I could hear you

626
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,780
calling me for breakfast.

627
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,140
You'd say,

628
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,380
"Mao Tou, Mao Tou,

629
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,100
Granny bought sticky rice cakes,

630
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,060
and fried dough sticks."

631
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,020
Then I'd quickly get up.

632
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,180
Also,

633
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,180
you and Brother Xiao Han

634
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,140
we'd go to school together.

635
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,100
Then after school,

636
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,820
we'd go to our secret base,

637
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,220
where

638
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,300
we'd play games,

639
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,820
play military chess,

640
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,580
and just have so much fun.

641
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,980
And in the summer,

642
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,260
I remember

643
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,860
that fan on the ceiling

644
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,940
spinning round and round,

645
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,300
while we ate popsicles

646
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,980
underneath.

647
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,380
And in winter,

648
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,340
during our winter break,

649
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,700
Granny would always buy
roasted sweet potatoes,

650
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,300
and bring them to us.

651
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,460
Then we'd eat them

652
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,140
while watching cartoons

653
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,500
under the wool blanket.

654
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,260
Yes.

655
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,420
Those were

656
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:10,900
the good times.

657
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,180
Why do we have to grow up?

658
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,980
When we grow up,

659
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,100
everything changes.

660
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,180
Nothing's the same.

661
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,460
Mao Tou.

662
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:04,900
Today…

663
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,020
Today, it's the first time

664
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,900
I saw her face properly.

665
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,700
When she left home,

666
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,620
you were still young,

667
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,220
so you probably
don't remember much.

668
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,500
No.

669
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,540
Actually…

670
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,180
actually I

671
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,380
secretly kept a photo of her.

672
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,060
The rest was burned

673
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,700
by my dad.

674
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,500
Well,

675
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,220
I found that one

676
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,700
in Grandma's belongings

677
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,540
after she passed.

678
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,380
I don't even know

679
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,380
why I kept it a secret.

680
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,740
When I learned

681
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,620
she was coming back,

682
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,540
I was quite scared.

683
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,500
Because

684
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,060
they always told me

685
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,220
that she was

686
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:01,940
a bad woman.

687
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,220
I was afraid

688
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,060
she'd be

689
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,220
just like they said.

690
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,940
But I'm also afraid she wasn't.

691
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,980
If she wasn't as bad as they said,

692
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,460
I'm afraid I'd miss her.

693
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,700
And if I miss her,

694
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,420
it would be like betraying my dad.

695
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:41,180
You don't need to overthink it.

696
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,420
Sometimes,

697
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,620
from different angles,

698
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,940
our standards for good and bad

699
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,780
are not the same.

700
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,860
As for

701
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,220
whether she is good or bad,

702
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,380
you don't have to listen to others.

703
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,860
You can try to understand her yourself.

704
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:00,730
I believe

705
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:04,020
your mom must love you dearly.

706
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:08,700
And,

707
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,700
most importantly,

708
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,060
both your dad and mom,

709
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,980
their love for you

710
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,300
is the same.

711
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,620
Didn't expect it to be so fast.

712
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,820
It barely took five minutes.

713
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,140
(Divorce Certificate)

714
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,020
Keep it separately.

715
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,420
Live your own life.

716
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,780
Take care of yourself.

717
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,980
Drop me off at the intersection

718
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,620
of Jiaozhou Road and Changshou Road.

719
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,940
I'll walk back.

720
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:41,860
No problem.

721
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,900
Free for a farewell meal?

722
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:54,820
Farewell meal?

723
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,780
Sure.

724
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,820
To celebrate

725
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,220
both of us regaining freedom.

726
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,020
Okay.

727
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,820
Japanese or Shanghai cuisine?

728
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,260
Japanese cuisine.

729
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,420
Alright, as you wish.

730
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,820
Then let's go for Shanghai cuisine.

731
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,420
Come on.

732
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,660
Let's celebrate!

733
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:18,060
I don't drink alcohol.

734
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,300
Just tea.

735
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,460
You quit?

736
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,740
I got the good stuff for you.

737
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,060
Your loss.

738
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,420
Weren't you a big drinker?

739
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,620
On my wedding day,

740
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,180
I was drunk as a skunk,

741
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,020
but you

742
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,140
didn't even blink.

743
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,460
Back then…

744
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,420
That was because I was young.

745
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,700
Such exciting things,

746
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,020
I really could drink a lot,

747
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,460
and didn't even blink.

748
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,020
But now, I can't.

749
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,380
I actually had a stomach issue,

750
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,260
gastric perforation.

751
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:04,860
I almost

752
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,420
didn't make it out of the hospital.

753
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,620
The doctor told me to quit.

754
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,540
I thought you went to Japan

755
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,780
and turned into a wine goddess.

756
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,500
Turns out you're still a mortal.

757
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,460
Is that old man good to you?

758
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,060
Which one?

759
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,220
Insane.

760
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,180
Marinated tofu with greens.

761
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,940
You still remember my favorite dish!

762
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,860
I'll tell you my story

763
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,740
to make you happy.

764
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,930
What's there to be me happy about?

765
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,380
Actually,

766
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,380
when I first went to Japan,

767
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,700
my life was nothing like

768
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,700
what you imagined.

769
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,820
I had no legal status then.

770
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,740
I was there illegally.

771
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,780
Every day, I was hiding

772
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,820
and scared they'd catch me

773
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,220
and send me back.

774
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,980
To survive, you know,

775
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,820
I really

776
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,260
did all kinds of odd jobs.

777
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,740
Every day before dawn,

778
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,020
I went out to work

779
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,660
and returned only at midnight

780
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,220
to my tiny apartment,

781
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:28,140
sitting on the little toilet,

782
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,620
eating cold rice balls.

783
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,540
Now that you know I've had it rough,

784
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,420
does it make you feel better?

785
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,060
These last few years,

786
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,660
things have been better.

787
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,020
I saved up a bit,

788
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,220
bought a house, and a car,

789
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,580
and even opened a shop,
became a boss.

790
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,020
But suddenly,

791
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,420
it all felt meaningless.

792
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,380
Always alone,

793
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,740
so lonely.

794
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,900
Why not come back?

795
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,860
It's been developing well these past years.

796
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,260
The overpasses are built

797
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,340
and the subways are open.

798
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,540
Isn't it nice to come back?

799
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,060
You really want me to come back?

800
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,820
If you do,

801
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,340
I'll stay.

802
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,060
When are you leaving?

803
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,340
Lose your cool?

804
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,940
Is your back sweating?

805
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,660
Why would I sweat?

806
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,260
Tomorrow.

807
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,740
I've already booked the ticket.

808
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,100
Everything's settled.

809
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,460
It's time to leave.

810
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,980
Yesterday,

811
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,780
Aiping helped organize it.

812
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,940
She told me to give it to you.

813
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,140
She said,

814
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,820
you're still his mom,

815
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,220
and Mao Tou is still your son.

816
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,500
When you have time,

817
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,860
come visit him.

818
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:29,980
Also,

819
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,940
Mao Tou wears size 43 shoes.

820
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,060
That's from me.

821
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,420
There's a photo

822
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,580
placed there by Mao Tou.

823
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,660
He said it's for you.

824
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,860
That little imp

825
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,050
hid that photo

826
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,420
and made it so wrinkled.

827
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,740
He said

828
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,700
he wants to go to Jinjiang Action Park.

829
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,260
If you're free tomorrow,

830
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,100
you can go with him.

831
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,400
You're leaving for Japan tomorrow.

832
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,500
I'll reschedule.

833
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,260
Kang, take a look.

834
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,340
Hao, let's go play outside.

835
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,420
A bit higher. Is this okay?

836
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,540
You go play yourself.

837
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,580
I stuck it on.

838
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:57,660
Eat this.

839
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,620
Hao, here.

840
00:38:58,860 --> 00:38:59,700
Mom.

841
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,700
Weihao,

842
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,420
can I watch a program for a while?

843
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,990
- My classmate's in it.
- Firecrackers.

844
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,220
Wait a moment.

845
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,100
I'm still watching.

846
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,340
Weihao, let me watch for a bit.

847
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,020
- You can first…
- Wait a moment.

848
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:10,900
I'm not done yet.

849
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,620
- Slow down.
- Okay.

850
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:16,660
Alright, now

851
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,700
to our final question

852
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,220
for this round.

853
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,180
Will Chang Wuji

854
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,020
defend his title

855
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,500
(Round Two: Chang Wuji, high school student)
or will the challenger

856
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,220
(Yu Yao, college student)
come out on top?

857
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,460
Ten numbers.

858
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,380
Get ready.

859
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,420
Here it is.

860
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:31,660
Stop.

861
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,620
Write down your answer.

862
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,340
Show your answer.

863
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,220
Let's see the answers.

864
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,380
One is

865
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,580
7965498135,

866
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:45,980
and the other is

867
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:50,100
7965418935.

868
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,500
Let's see,

869
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,780
the correct answer is…

870
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:58,100
Congrats, Chang Wuji got it right again.

871
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:01,220
- Chang Wuji defended the title again!
- So impressive!

872
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,060
Congrats!

873
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,060
Now,

874
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,220
let's welcome Chang Wuji…

875
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,300
Qian Jiayue, did you watch
Chang Wuji's game?

876
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,540
Don't even.

877
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,020
I didn't get to watch it.

878
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,240
Why didn't you watch it?

879
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,500
But don't worry.

880
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,660
We all watched it for you.

881
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:14,900
He's so good.

882
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,300
He'll definitely win all the way

883
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,390
and take the championship.

884
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,060
Too bad I didn't bring my phone book.

885
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,740
Remember to congratulate him for me.

886
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,220
No way.

887
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,580
I'll go get his number for you.

888
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:25,660
Chen Mo,

889
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,300
forget it.

890
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,420
I need your help with something else.

891
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,700
What's up?

892
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,780
I might not make it back on the sixth.

893
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,980
Before celebrating
Brother Xiao Han's birthday,

894
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,300
can you go to my place first?

895
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,940
I had Granny make his favorite dish.

896
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,580
Can you take it over for me

897
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,780
and wish him

898
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:42,860
a happy birthday?

899
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,580
Sure, no problem.

900
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,690
Is it time for New Year's Eve dinner?

901
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,900
Don't eat too much,

902
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,320
or you'll come back twice your size.

903
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,940
We'll see who gets bigger.

904
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,100
Thank you, aunt.

905
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,580
- Good fortune and prosperity.
- Jiali.

906
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,780
What's wrong? You're not happy?

907
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:04,980
Happy New Year.

908
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:07,980
Happy New Year.

909
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:11,860
Jiali,

910
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,460
where are you going?

911
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,300
I'm done eating.

912
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,260
I'll go study.

913
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,380
It's New Year, we're all together.

914
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,540
Why study now?

915
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:20,660
Sit down.

916
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:21,940
Jiali.

917
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,260
Come sit.

918
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:26,700
Enjoy the food.

919
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,900
Cheer up, okay?

920
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,890
It's New Year, after all.

921
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,220
Look at her.

922
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,060
This is really good.

923
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,820
No idea what she wants to do.

924
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,780
She can't even help with chores.

925
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:37,660
I heard

926
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,490
Jiali is going to Dongguan
after the New Year.

927
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:40,780
Anyways,

928
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,780
girls don't need to study, right?

929
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,060
Exactly, what's the point of studying?

930
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:44,900
They'll get married.

931
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:45,780
- Aunt.
- Indeed.

932
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,860
Jiali's grades are so good,

933
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,220
why won't you let her study?

934
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,620
Jiayue,

935
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,340
your uncle doesn't make much

936
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,300
all year round.

937
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,180
But when Jiali graduates,

938
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,900
she can go out and make money.

939
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,300
You should think long-term.

940
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,260
Indeed a city child,

941
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,100
so different,

942
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,980
speaking so eloquently.

943
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,580
Is this the well-rounded education?

944
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,300
Is this how you talk to the elders?

945
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,580
Watch your attitude.

946
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:17,900
But

947
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,020
what Jiayue said isn't wrong.

948
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,020
Jiali's doing so well in school,

949
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,420
why not let her study?

950
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,260
Instead…

951
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:25,880
