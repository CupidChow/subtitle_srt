Let's find out together.

34
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,360
This lucky person is from Putuo District.

35
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,290

- Putuo District.

36
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,150

Why didn't your luck
as a union leader

55
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,190
pass to me?

56
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,960

57
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,470

61
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,280
in my whole life?

62
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,550
Luck?

It's all about my strength!

65
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,520

66
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,190

How did you all know?

101
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,160
Your mom told everyone.

102
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,560
She was louder than the speaker.

103
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:49,870
Not just Workers' New Village,

104
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,560

I'm heading back.

128
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,150
Brother Xiao Han,

129
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,360
Granny said tonight…

130
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,350
I know.

131
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,390
Dinner at your's tonight.

132
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,400
Your mom told me.

133
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,830
Hurry, Xiao Han.

134
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:37,910
She already told you.

135
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:41,920
Nice shot!

136
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,950
One more, one more!

137
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,080
Ka Men.

138
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,360
You startled me!

139
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,630
You walk like a cat!

140
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,680
Where are those two?

141
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,070
Still playing.

142
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,390
Mao Tou asked me

143
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,510
to bring his backpack back.

144
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,530
What's wrong with you?

145
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,240
You look upset.

146
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,650
Didn't you already
get the admission letter?

147
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,180
It's because of my mom.

148
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:11,790
Jiayue,

149
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,080
congratulations!

150
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,000
Thanks, Auntie.

151
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,790
Come in.

152
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,390
See?

153
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,070
Don't you think
my mom's annoying?

154
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,220
She's been hollering around.

155
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,480
Now the whole world knows

156
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,710
I got into No. 2 Middle School.

157
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,920
On the street,

158
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,430
everyone was smiling at me.

159
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,750
You're upset

160
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,630
because she told Xiao Han first.

161
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,390
Does it matter who told him?

162
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,920
It matters.

163
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,240
Four years ago,

164
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,430
I was two points short

165
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,270
of getting into the No. 2 Middle School.

166
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,720
I worked so hard for four years

167
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,070
just to be at the same school as him.

168
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,830
Now that I've finally made it,

169
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,480
I should be the one to tell him.

170
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,310
Boss Lady, forty wontons, please.

171
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,870
Xiu'e, you startled me.

172
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,820
Forty, huh?

173
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,590
Let me finish tallying this first.

174
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,630
What's up?

175
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,940
Why are you so close?

176
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,640
Just wanted to take a good look

177
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,190
at your expression,

178
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,020
and see if you're happy

179
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,310
or not today.

180
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,160
Are you crazy?

181
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,370
Stop doing that.

182
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,600
Wait here.

183
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,750
I'll get your wontons.

184
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,920
You look unhappy.

185
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,960
Aiping.

186
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,560
Sit here, Aiping.

187
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,880
What's going on?

188
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,510
Aiping, listen to me.

189
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,040
My daughter Qian Jiayue

190
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,290
got her admission letter
to No. 2 Middle School.

191
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,500
Jiayue got in?

192
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,550
Congratulations!

193
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,800
Keep it low-key.

194
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,240
Looking at Pei's face,

195
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,680
her daughter Ka Men

196
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,330
didn't get into No. 2, right?

197
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,850
We've been friends for years.

198
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,390
Should I just lay low?

199
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,030
Xiu'e.

200
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,390
- Actually…
- Aiping.

201
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,400
One mung bean soup.

202
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,510
Okay, have a seat.

203
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,600
Okay.

204
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,520
Sister Huang,

205
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,600
a bowl of mung bean soup!

206
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,560
Got it.

207
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,590
Xiu'e.

208
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,070
- Actually, Pei…
- Yes, yes.

209
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,800
Actually, her Ka Men really

210
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,000
can't compare

211
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,750
to my Jiayue, right?

212
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,390
My baby aimed for No. 2,

213
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,750
and Ka Men aimed for it too.

214
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,830
But it isn't just for anyone.

215
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,160
It's No. 2 Middle School,

216
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,360
a model school,

217
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,430
and a key school.

218
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,870
Not everyone can get in.

219
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,070
Aiping,

220
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,950
do you think
I should invite Pei

221
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,750
to the celebration?

222
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,550
If I do,

223
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,240
it'll just remind her
of her disappointment.

224
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,120
That's not good either.

225
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,350
You startled me.

226
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,000
You're upset.

227
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,600
I'm just speaking the truth.

228
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,440
Come on.

229
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,750
Actually, Ka Men is also excellent.

230
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,000
Ka Men. Ka Men.

231
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:52,710
A terrible name!

232
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,360
It's a nickname from kids.

233
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,440
Why are you calling it too?

234
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,030
Is it that hard to get in?

235
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,870
Is it really that special?

236
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,840
Xiao Han got a direct admission,

237
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,600
and I didn't hear
Aiping bragging

238
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,440
like you.

239
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,120
She's upset
because Ka Men didn't get in.

240
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,110
See?

241
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,240
What's this?

242
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,510
I can't see it.

243
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,240
Can you read it for me?

244
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,430
No. 2 Middle School admission letter.
Whose is it?

245
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,360
(Admission Letter of
Shanghai Puyang No. 2 Middle School)

246
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,120
Liu Wanqing,

247
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,030
you've been admitted…

248
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:26,910
Wang Shuangpei!

249
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,760
- Are you teasing me?
- She got in.

250
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,390
Why didn't you tell me?

251
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,080
You said Qing wouldn't make it.

252
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,600
- She did!
- You should tell me.

253
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,790
Why didn't you tell me?

254
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,390
All three of them got in.

255
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,150
Don't crumple it.

256
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,420
(Admission Letter)
I'll tell Baby the news.

257
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,030
You and Brother Xiao Han also got
into No. 2.

258
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,670
Your mom and Xiao Han's mom

259
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,360
(Qian Jiayue)
didn't brag about it.

260
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,270
Only she did.

261
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,000
This is so embarrassing.

262
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,240
Relax.

263
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,900
After the summer break,

264
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,750
you'll go to school

265
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,750
and come home every day

266
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,910
with your Brother Xiao Han.

267
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,790
I have a feeling

268
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,240
that for the next three years,

269
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,510
I'll be abandoned by you

270
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,870
and be all alone.

271
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,000
Only Jeff Chang will stay with me.

272
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,840
What nonsense are you saying?

273
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,200
I'm not talking nonsense.

274
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,310
I feel like

275
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,550
this secret base of yours

276
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:17,170
won't even have space
for Mao Tou soon.

277
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,920
Brother Xiao Han.

278
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,870
Jiayue.

279
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,360
Go inside.

280
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,080
Mao Tou,

281
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,870
what did you do this time?

282
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,630
Nothing.

283
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,040
Are you sure?

284
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,870
You said you'd do homework
after basketball

285
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,240
but went to the arcade instead,

286
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,330
playing Street Fighter

287
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,870
and even gambling.

288
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,240
What did you promise last time?

289
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,000
No more gambling or no allowance.

290
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,710
Give me the money.

291
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,590
Don't, please.

292
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,480
Hurry up.

293
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,680
Come on.

294
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,570
Hurry, let go.

295
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,840
- I won't.
- Let go.

296
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,600
Jiayue, don't do this!

297
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,240
- You can't do this, Jiayue.
- It's my lunch money.

298
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,320
Lunch money?

299
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,720
Granny said

300
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,060
your dad's on a business trip
this week.

301
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,820
You have all meals at my house.

302
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,240
(Ten yuan)
Tenner for you.

303
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,250
I'll hold the rest
until Uncle gets back.

304
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,320
It is too little!

305
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,510
Shut it.

306
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,550
I'm heading out now.

307
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,640
You're leaving?

308
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,870
Wait for me.

309
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,750
We're leaving now.

310
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,080
Give me my money back.

311
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,920
No way.

312
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,480
Why are you walking so fast?

313
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,270
I'm tactful.

314
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,790
I'm not as clueless

315
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,600
as Mao Tou.

316
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,040
By the way,

317
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,390
you said your mom would
buy you a computer

318
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,970
if you got into No. 2 Middle School?

319
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,840
Once you get it,

320
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,190
Xiao Han doesn't need to go

321
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,000
to Mao Tou's new house
at Jinxiu Garden.

322
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,480
He can use yours instead.

323
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,160
Let's go for a stroll at Xidian Mall

324
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,030
to celebrate the acceptance
of both of us.

325
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,360
It's to celebrate
you getting a computer.

326
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,550
Same thing.

327
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,390
It's a celebration.

328
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,500
(Yingmo Community)

329
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:59,100
(Puyang New Village)

330
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,160
Granny,

331
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,030
I'm back!

332
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,870
You're back.

333
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,040
Granny,

334
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,720
I bought some Butterfly crisps for you

335
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,600
at the entrance.

336
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,630
Butterfly crisp?

337
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,870
Let me see!

338
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,630
Here.

339
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,470
You bought a lot!

340
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,440
I'll try one.

341
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,630
How is it? Does it taste like before?

342
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,630
Delicious. Thank you so much,

343
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,470
my good girl.

344
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,720
What are you two eating?

345
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,920
Butterfly crisp.

346
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,000
Baby, give me one.

347
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,840
I want to try it too.

348
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,230
Mom,

349
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,120
why did you tell everyone

350
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,550
about my entering No. 2?

351
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:37,750
It's good news.

352
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,870
Of course, I want to share it

353
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,390
and make everyone happy!

354
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,630
Coming!

355
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,920
Coming!

356
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,910
- Godmother.
- Mao Tou.

357
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:52,910
- Auntie.
- Xiao Han.

358
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,550
Hurry, wash up and get ready to eat.

359
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,390
Why are you wearing my shoes?

360
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,840
They're all the same.

361
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,270
Mao Tou!

362
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,030
Did you wash your hands?

363
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,910
You scared me.

364
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,630
Baby, don't scare him.

365
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:16,030
Youngsters are growing.

366
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,550
They get hungry easily.

367
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,160
Granny,

368
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,320
you don't know.

369
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,910
He played games and gambled today.

370
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,070
Playing games and gambling?

371
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,000
Mao Tou, I warn you

372
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,360
so you can't do that.

373
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:29,840
Relax, Jiayue.

374
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,910
I've already told Mao Tou off.

375
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,790
If he stops gambling,

376
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,740
we might consider

377
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,870
giving his money back.

378
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,750
I didn't say yes.

379
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,080
By the way, Mao Tou,

380
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,950
I need to use your computer
in the morning.

381
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,400
I need to type up a document.

382
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,590
No problem.

383
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,750
Brother Xiao Han,

384
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,120
actually, I'll soon
have a computer too.

385
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,320
You can use mine

386
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,870
in the future.

387
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,390
It'll be closer

388
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,550
than going to Mao Tou's house

389
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,670
at Jinxiu Garden.

390
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,240
That's great. Thanks in advance.

391
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,350
Brother Xiao Han,

392
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,210
I've finished
the Writing Collection.

393
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,360
I'll go get it for you,

394
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,590
I might forget later.

395
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,590
Okay.

396
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,550
I saved a lot of time,

397
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,140
since you got a computer.

398
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,160
Jiayue,

399
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:27,990
come here.

400
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,440
Granny,

401
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,480
I bought some Butterfly crisps for you

402
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,360
at the entrance.

403
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,440
- Here.
- You bought a lot!

404
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,480
I'll try one.

405
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,150
Mom! Mom!

406
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,080
What's wrong, Baby?

407
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,790
You read my diary again, right?

408
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,360
I didn't!

409
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,320
You definitely did.

410
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,720
The hair I placed inside is gone.

411
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,030
Hair? Oh dear,

412
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,150
hair is so light.

413
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:25,990
It might've

414
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,390
floated away

415
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,360
or fallen somewhere.

416
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,960
The key is not in the right place.

417
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,000
Baby, why are you guarding against me

418
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,080
like I'm a thief?

419
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,200
Uncle Qian.

420
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,440
- Your dad's back.
- I'm back.

421
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,790
Let's eat first.

422
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,670
Xiao Han, you're here.

423
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,680
Godfather.

424
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:44,710
Mao Tou.

425
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,910
Such a feast today.

426
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,240
What's the occasion?

427
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,960
I'll be right back.

428
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,470
I forgot to tell him.

429
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,110
Honey,

430
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,510
Baby got into No. 2 Middle School.

431
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,240
Her admission letter arrived today.

432
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,680
Really?

433
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:03,650
That's amazing.

434
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,530
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

435
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:06,710
Come on, mom.

436
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,110
Didn't you say you've called dad?

437
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,360
Everyone else knows

438
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,440
except him!

439
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:15,750
This is fantastic!

440
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,240
Your mom

441
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,480
gets carried away

442
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,080
no matter what she does.

443
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,000
I did it on purpose.

444
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,270
I meant to do it.

445
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,870
I wanted to surprise Qian Kang.

446
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,290
Are you surprised, honey?

447
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,900
So surprised.

448
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,160
Jiayue,

449
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,120
I'm thinking…

450
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:33,990
Baby,

451
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,230
Director Dong watched you grow up,

452
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,270
and I haven't told him
the good news yet.

453
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,260
I'll give him a call.

454
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,360
Finish eating first!

455
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,750
Let's talk after dinner.

456
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,350
Come on.

457
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,690
Let's congratulate Jiayue

458
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,900
on getting into No. 2 Middle School.

459
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,670
And congrats to Xiao Han too.

460
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,630
- Yes, yes.
- Come on, come on.

461
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,150
You're so amazing, Baby!

462
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:00,330
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

463
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,110
Baby,

464
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,200
you and Xiao Han got
into No. 2 Middle School.

465
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,070
We're really so happy!

466
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,590
What do you wish for?

467
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,270
Granny will grant it.

468
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,630
I have three wishes.

469
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,040
The first one is

470
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,630
that I hope once I start high school,

471
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,400
no one will read my diary anymore.

472
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,400
Godmother,
what did Sister Jiayue write this time?

473
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,960
Me? Read her diary?

474
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,310
I didn't.

475
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,640
- No, no.
- Baby,

476
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,320
don't worry.

477
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,920
Granny will keep an eye on it for you.

478
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,240
Thank you, Granny.

479
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,270
Jiayue, what's your second wish?

480
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:47,880
The second one is

481
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,680
that I hope no one in our family

482
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,030
tries to take advantage of others

483
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,220
and gets looked down upon.

484
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:58,920
I'm heading out!

485
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,480
Chen Xiu'e,

486
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,510
you haven't been paid

487
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,950
for the forty wontons yet.

488
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,070
Wang Shuangpei,

489
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,310
I'll treat you the lobster

490
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,850
and big crabs

491
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,960
at Fuguilou Restaurant.

492
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,850
And you still want money

493
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:14,690
for those wontons?

494
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:17,060
So stingy. I'm leaving.

495
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,550
Why are you looking at me?

496
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,910
I swear

497
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,400
I'm generous.

498
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,920
Baby got into No. 2 Middle School.

499
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,270
I promised the neighbors

500
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,440
I'd treat them
at Fuguilou Restaurant.

501
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,790
I'm the most generous person.

502
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,540
- Why would they look down on me?
- Alright.

503
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,350
I just said what I want to say.

504
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,880
What's your third wish?

505
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,480
My third wish.

506
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,070
You all know it.

507
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,520
Mom,

508
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,200
you promised me.

509
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,350
Promised what?

510
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,720
It was during the New Year,

511
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,160
you promised me.

512
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,240
You said

513
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,000
if I got into No. 2 Middle School,

514
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,110
you'd buy me

515
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,480
a computer like Mao Tou's.

516
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,000
Xiu'e, you promised Jiayue a computer.

517
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,220
Baby,

518
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,600
I really don't

519
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,270
remember that.

520
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,480
I do.

521
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,880
Godmother said that.

522
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,670
You were sitting exactly

523
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,880
where Godfather's now,

524
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,680
and said if Sister Jiayue gets
into No. 2 Middle School,

525
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,960
let alone a computer,

526
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,840
you'd even pluck the moon
from the sky for her.

527
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,810
That does sound like her.

528
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,070
I think I remember too.

529
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,440
A computer is expensive.

530
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,590
You can't just decide to buy it
like this.

531
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,880
Then you shouldn't

532
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,310
make a promise so easily.

533
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,590
Stop causing a scene.

534
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,790
Baby,

535
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,550
let's hold off on the computer.

536
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,490
Make another wish.

537
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,440
Whatever you say,

538
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,270
I will make it happen, okay?

539
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,750
How about a trip to Yangzhou?

540
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,270
Didn't you want to visit Yangzhou?

541
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,480
Yangzhou?

542
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,720
When did I ever say that?

543
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,420
That was something I wrote
in my diary last year.

544
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:01,880
You again.

545
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,830
Sister Jiayue, seems like you'll still
need to use my computer.

546
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,910
Yes, use his.

547
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,420
We're all family.

548
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,160
No need to be shy.
Am I right, Mao Tou?

549
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,680
What was my second wish again?

550
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,550
Don't take advantage of others.

551
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:27,970
Who wants rice?

552
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,350
A bowl for Mao Tou.

553
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,110
One bowl is enough.

554
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,000
God-grandma, Godfather,

555
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,720
Godmother, we are leaving.

556
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,880
Alright, Mao Tou,

557
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,790
remember your homework.

558
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,790
Thank you, Auntie.

559
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,720
I'm heading back now.

560
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,160
Okay, come here
for dinner tomorrow.

561
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,350
Sure.

562
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,920
Brother Xiao Han,
the chicken soup.

563
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,080
Oh, right.

564
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,430
Thanks.

565
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,560
I'm off.

566
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:02,700
- Bye.
- Bye.

567
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,540
Goodbye.

568
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,860
(Jiale Wontons)

569
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,920
Unbelievable.

570
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,270
Why was business so good today?

571
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,510
All the pork wontons sold out.

572
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,120
Should we

573
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,790
buy more pork tomorrow?

574
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,590
Qing, you should go to bed.

575
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,090
Did you finish all the vegetables today?

576
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,320
Yes, all gone.

577
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,510
What about the meat?

578
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,070
That's gone too.

579
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,520
Liu Songming.

580
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,580
I think we mustn't buy

581
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,590
too much pork tomorrow.

582
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,880
- What if it doesn't sell out?
- Sure.

583
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,920
If we run out,

584
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,750
just ask Gu to deliver some.

585
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,670
Alright.

586
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:43,960
Mom,

587
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:45,220
look at Jiayue's mom.

588
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,210
She's so happy that Jiayue got
into No. 2.

589
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,860
I also got into No. 2,

590
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:51,600
but you and dad didn't
even say anything.

591
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,460
What do you expect us to say?

592
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,070
Remember,

593
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:57,880
you're studying for yourself,

594
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,590
not for me or dad.

595
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,000
If you study well,

596
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,240
the one who benefits is you.

597
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,480
Understand?

598
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,110
Who's calling?

599
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,520
Jiayue.

600
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,510
Qing is here.

601
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,820
I'll answer it upstairs.

602
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:16,880
She's going upstairs.

603
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:17,880
Wait a moment.

604
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,880
Mom, I've picked it up.
You can hang up.

605
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,070
Hello, Jiayue.

606
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,510
My mom won't buy me a computer.

607
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,960
Really? But wasn't it agreed?

608
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,680
You know how she is.

609
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:39,960
She never

610
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,100
keeps her word.

611
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,030
It's not the first time.

612
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,200
Forget it.

613
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,030
The computer's quite pricey.

614
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:45,870
It's understandable.

615
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,900
But it's not like I even asked for it!

616
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,870
She promised it herself.

617
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,940
At least your parents
hold a celebration for you.

618
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,780
Mine didn't even say anything.

619
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:56,920
She holds that

620
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,400
for her own face.

621
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,390
I don't want to go.

622
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,790
Alright.

623
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,200
Xiao Han is going, and you are not?

624
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,040
Honestly,

625
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,550
when do you plan on telling him?

626
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,040
I…

627
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,760
Baby,

628
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,750
I peeled an apple for you.

629
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,160
Want a bite?

630
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,700
No.

631
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:21,880
I'm already going to bed.

632
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,680
I clearly heard you on the phone.

633
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,750
What are you doing?

634
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,400
It's a bit dusty.

635
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,240
I'm cleaning it.

636
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,200
Don't eavesdrop on my calls.

637
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,110
Your mom did it again?

638
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,150
It's her again.

639
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,440
Baby,

640
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,000
don't worry.

641
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,550
Bad people are already
taken care of by me.

642
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,960
Mom, you're back.

643
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,790
Did you have dinner?

644
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,720
Yes, I did.

645
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,160
Why does it smell like glue here?

646
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,820
This afternoon,

647
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,510
I helped a friend with a model.

648
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,240
There's some chicken soup
from Jiayue's Granny.

649
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,200
I'll go heat it up.

650
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,880
Han, don't bother.

651
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,160
I'll heat it myself.

652
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,110
Go do your homework.

653
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,110
Okay, I will.

654
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,840
Come out.

655
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,000
It's in the pot.

656
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:34,910
Alright.

657
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:39,740
Han, I just bought celery and pork.

658
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,070
Later, I'll make some dumplings

659
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,110
and freeze them for you.

660
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,400
Eat them if you're hungry.

661
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,430
Okay.

662
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,760
What's wrong?

663
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,590
The pen leaked on my clothes.

664
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,240
Leave it in the bathroom.

665
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,110
I'll wash it.

666
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,720
It's alright, I'll do it myself.

667
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,760
Han,

668
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,880
does your pen always leak?

669
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,880
Wasn't the prize

670
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,480
for your first place

671
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,720
a pen?

672
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,480
Why aren't you using it?

673
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:09,910
It's okay.

674
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,080
This one still works.

(Speech Contest First Prize)

676
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,640
What would you wish for?

677
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:26,920
Granny will grant your wish.

678
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,240
A computer is expensive.

679
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,310
You can't just decide to buy it
like this.

680
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,350
Want some?

681
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,520
If not, forget it.

682
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:45,400
Humph.

683
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,320
All of you

684
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,310
act like spoiled kids.

685
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:53,950
Xiu'e,

686
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,310
how about we buy Jiayue

687
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,400
a computer?

688
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,200
That's easy for you to say.

689
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,960
I've already checked.

690
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,480
Do you know how much a computer costs?

691
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,350
I'd have to work for a year

692
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,400
without spending a dime,

693
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,320
and still need to
add money to buy it.

694
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,880
Maybe borrow a bit from mom?

695
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,930
We can pay her back later.

696
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:19,870
Worst case,

697
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,880
I'll drive a few more trips,

698
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,040
and we will manage.

699
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,550
Anyone,

700
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,680
but her,

701
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,510
I need my dignity.

702
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,680
You know

703
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,070
how she treated me before.

704
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,400
Forget about her.

705
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,000
Come on,

706
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,880
eat up.

707
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,080
Really?

708
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,310
I promised to reward you.

709
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,490
Hurry, change clothes.

(Keji Yuelian Computer Store)

711
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:08,200
Baby, let's go.

712
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:11,270
Qiu, heading to work?

713
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,010
Is this your daughter?

714
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,480
She's changed so much.

715
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,880
- Auntie.
- She's got in No. 2.

716
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,880
Do you know that school?

717
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,720
It's a model school.

718
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,110
Sister, you're really lucky.

719
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,160
Oh, your good fortune is ahead!

720
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,000
You go ahead.

721
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,310
- I'm seeing a friend.
- See you.

722
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,590
Mom,

723
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,070
why did you bring me to the mall?

724
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:32,030
Weren't we going to buy a computer?

725
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,720
Baby, I'll get you some clothes first.

726
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,720
The sales reps here

727
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,000
are all friends of mine.

728
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,400
We'll just say hi.

729
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,970
Sis!

730
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,200
- Mom.
- This one…

731
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,110
Baby, come, come.

732
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,200
This one is nice.

733
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,400
It looks good on you.

734
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,350
Look in the mirror.

735
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,750
Such a graceful young lady.

736
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,110
Everything looks good on her.

737
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,880
My daughter isn't just graceful

738
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,790
and pretty.

739
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,960
She's smart too.

740
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,070
Just entered No. 2 as well.

That's so impressive.

Clearly, you raise her so well.

745
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,110
You're a good mom.

So, Madam,

747
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,590
since she got into No. 2,

748
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,510
this outfit is perfect

749
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,560

00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,310
not the Qipu Road.

756
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,350
You drive a hard bargain.

757
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,110
I also work at this mall.

758
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,070
I know

759
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,070
the rules.

760
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Don't you recognize me?

761
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,370
I know Manager Cai.

762
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,510
Call him out.

763
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,400
I'll talk to him.

764
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,110
You work here?

765
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,000
Where do you work?

766
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,830
I sell thermal underwear
on the third floor.

767
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,480
So, I know

768
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,580
how the discounts work here.

769
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,480
You come to me next time.

770
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,500
I'll give you a discount.

771
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,200
Since you know Manager Cai,

772
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,550
I'll give you the employee price.

773
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:50,630
70 percent off,

774
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,160
just pay me 140 yuan.

775
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,510
You are not sincere.

776
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,680
140? Are you serious?

777
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,510
Fine, let's compromise.

778
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,400
I'll add ten more.

779
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:00,000
70, okay?

780
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,560
- Mom.
- Madam, it's…

781
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,270
I don't want this dress.

782
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,400
I'll go change it.

783
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,320
Baby.

784
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:08,640
Take another look.

785
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,750
Does this one look good?

786
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,480
This dress is nice.

787
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,070
That's

788
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,380
how you bargain.

789
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:17,610
You stay quiet, okay?

790
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,590
So, what do you think?

791
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,640
Here's the deal, Madam.

792
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,270
I'll give you a final price,

793
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,260
120 yuan.

794
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,510
No, no, 120 is too expensive.

795
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,400
- Madam.
- There are so many cheap dresses,

796
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,240
but I want this one.

797
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,160
Okay then, Madam.

798
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,550
- How about this one?
- I'm really satisfied

799
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,650
(Yami)
with these two clothes.

800
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,680
They're so pretty.

801
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,960
When you wear this

802
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,160
in registration day,

803
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,880
everyone will see

804
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,160
you're beautiful like a princess.

805
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,510
Then why would you bargain with her

806
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,350
for so long.

807
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,110
It was so embarrassing.

808
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,790
How so?

809
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:51,960
My money doesn't fall

810
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,920
from the sky.

811
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,790
I work 12 hours a day as a sales rep.

812
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,000
This is how I make my living.

813
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,680
Baby, dig in.

814
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,110
We'll head home when you're done,

815
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,480
and show your dad the new dress.

816
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,590
We're going home after this?

817
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,920
You've had the burger

818
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,400
and new clothes,

819
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,640
of course we're going home.

820
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,790
But didn't you say

821
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:11,960
we were gonna buy a computer?

822
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,440
Baby,

823
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,930
I said

824
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:21,960
I'd reward you.

825
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:23,880
This is the reward,

826
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,350
and this too.

827
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,550
Baby, I've asked your dad

828
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,000
to take time off.

829
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:33,270
Then we'll go to Yangzhou.

830
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,320
How about it?

831
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,550
Baby, as for the computer,

832
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,590
once you get into college,

833
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,790
I'll buy it for you.

834
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,550
I'm a woman of my word.

835
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,790
If you don't believe me,

836
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,880
let's make a pinky promise.

837
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,880
Come on, pinky promise.

838
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,870
Let's do it.

839
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,760
Fine. Eat more.

840
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,520
Granny, I'm home.

841
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:00,960
Welcome back.

842
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,420
Baby, don't be upset, okay?

843
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:13,480
No computer?

844
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,160
You lied to her again.

845
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,550
I didn't lie to her.

846
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:19,000
I gave her rewards.

847
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,070
What kind of reward is that?

848
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,510
What's wrong with them?

849
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:23,910
They're really nice.

850
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:24,750
Baby.

851
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,240
Baby,

852
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,550
don't get upset.

853
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:30,790
If your mom won't buy you a computer,

854
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,000
I knew a way.

855
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,880
I'll call your uncles

856
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,480
and tell them to get it for you.

857
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,790
Mom, stop messing around.

858
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,570
I don't want their money.

859
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,010
Baby, don't worry.

860
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:44,880
I'm not like your mom,

861
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:45,920
who breaks promises.

862
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,310
Always stir things up.

863
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,020
Baby,

864
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,310
your mom's gone to her room.

865
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,110
I'm coming in.

866
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,720
Granny,

867
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,510
I'm fine.

868
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:08,750
Let me ask you.

869
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,110
What are you doing later?

870
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:10,950
Any plans?

871
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,350
What about Mao Tou

872
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:15,070
and Xiao Han?

873
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,560
Qian Jiayue.

874
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,840
What?

875
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,510
When we head back,

876
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:56,790
you can go to the secret base.

877
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,840
Why?

878
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,840
Treasure hunt.

879
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,880
What treasure?

880
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,310
You'll know when you get there.

881
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,030
Here, have a popsicle each.

882
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,110
Thank you, Granny.

883
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,170
Thanks, Granny.

884
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:07,010
Here.

885
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,110
Thanks, God-grandma.

886
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:41,060
(Wonton shop payday)

887
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,640
Hope we didn't lose money
this month.

888
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,320
What's wrong?

889
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,680
What happened?

890
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,880
It's about the computer, right?

891
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:04,270
Computers are really expensive.

892
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,800
How did you know
it's because of the computer?

893
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,440
Qing said it yesterday.

894
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,760
She tells everyone but not me.

895
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,150
What's the point in telling you?

896
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,710
You never keep your word.

897
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,550
I never keep my word?

898
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,590
I told her I'd reward her.

899
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,030
I bought her two new dresses.

900
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,880
Both look so nice.

901
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,860
Dresses? Come on.

902
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,650
Can dresses compare to a computer?

903
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,430
A computer

904
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,550
costs thousands, really pricey.

905
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,320
Do you know how much
we're spending now?

906
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,510
For our family of three,

907
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,360
I only give my mom 500 for meals.

908
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,280
I already feel guilty.

909
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,480
We needed to pay
for Baby's extra classes before.

910
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,070
Now she got
into No. 2 Middle School.

911
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:49,760
I have to treat the neighbors to a meal,

912
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,320
you know, just to be polite.

913
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,550
Nothing comes free,

914
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:53,590
truly.

915
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,190
Slow down.

916
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,710
Alright, alright.

917
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,110
Let's not dwell on unhappy things.

918
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,280
Jiayue getting into
No. 2 is a good thing.

919
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,800
Don't worry.

920
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,720
Yeah.

921
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,110
I won't chat with you now.

922
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,030
I have to go to work.

923
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:20,550
Go ahead.

924
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,000
Have you eaten?

925
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:22,950
Yes, I have.

926
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,480
Don't worry, cheer up.

927
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:26,970
Slow down.

928
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,150
Aiping is really busy.

929
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,320
Working around the clock.

930
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,960
Look at Aiping,

931
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,890
working so hard,

932
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:38,000
but never complaining.

933
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,300
You should be content.

934
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,200
I'd rather have

935
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,150
Baby close to me.

936
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,360
Would you trade places

937
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,200
with Aiping?

938
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,160
Her husband

939
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,400
died,

940
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,550
and she lost her job.

941
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,760
The whole family depends on her.

942
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:55,110
She works for me during the day,

943
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:55,950
then at night,

944
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,590
she works as a nanny.

945
00:35:58,610 --> 00:35:59,590
Would you do it?

946
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,630
Mrs. Guan, take one meatball.

947
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,480
That's enough for me.
Enjoy your meal.

948
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,550
Alright.

949
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:47,960
Aiping.

950
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,350
Aiping.

951
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:51,390
It's me.

952
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:52,870
Coming.

953
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:55,350
Pei.

954
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,190
Isn't Han home?

955
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:58,590
He's not home.

956
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,230
He's out for computer.

957
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,550
Kids nowadays love computers.

958
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,960
I can't see what's so fun about it.

959
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,550
Here, take this.

960
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,280
It's extra from the shop tonight.

961
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,730
It won't sell tomorrow.

962
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:10,110
Cook it for Han.

963
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,110
Thank you so much.

964
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,310
Don't say that.

965
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:15,670
You didn't come
just to deliver wontons, did you?

966
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,670
- Come in.
- No, no.

967
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,250
Speaking of, I'm so angry.

968
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,760
That Chen Xiu'e

969
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,670
who came to the shop and spoke nonsense.

970
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,070
I totally forgot

971
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,110
today's the 15th,

972
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,280
the payday.

973
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,670
Well, today's double happiness
for me then.

974
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,080
If you say it like that,

975
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:33,800
it might be triple happiness.

976
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,620
This is from Chen Xiu'e for Han.

977
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:37,910
Take it.

978
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,330
Xiu'e buys shoes for Han every year.

979
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,030
But now,

980
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,630
they've got other needs to fill.

981
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,180
I can't accept this.

982
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,900
No need to feel awkward.

983
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,760
This is stuff for disposal.

984
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,510
And the quality

985
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:54,190
is quite poor,

986
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,240
right?

987
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:57,810
Alright.

988
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,190
I'm leaving.

989
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,390
Okay.

990
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,320
I'll call Xiu'e later.

991
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,550
Just accept it.

992
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:05,280
Don't forget the wontons.

993
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,720
Pei.

994
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,200
Pei.

995
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:22,180
You paid me extra.

996
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,760
My shop is doing well this month.

997
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,800
It's a bonus.

998
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,880
Mom, I'm back.

999
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:37,990
You're back.

1000
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,630
I'll heat up some milk for you.

1001
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,710
It's from Jiayue's mom again?

1002
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,760
Yes, take a look.

1003
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:08,010
Treasure hunt.

1004
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,230
Treasure hunt.

1005
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,510
Use it to write your diary.

1006
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:33,550
The old one

1007
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,360
can be used as a decoy
for Godmother.

1008
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:38,740
Jiayue.

1009
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:40,700
Brother Xiao Han.

1010
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,720
Here.

1011
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,960
This is your reward
for getting into No. 2.

1012
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,880
This is your prize.

1013
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,400
From the speech contest.

1014
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,790
It's called a treasure hunt,
but it's not really a treasure.

1015
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:52,570
You can open it.

1016
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,150
You don't like the reward

1017
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,160
from your mom,

1018
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,670
so Mao Tou and I get you one.

1019
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,760
So you planned this.

1020
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,760
I hope this pen helps you

1021
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,320
write the articles you like

1022
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,670
in high school.

1023
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,160
It's gold!

1024
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,880
No, no, this is too expensive.

1025
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:17,440
Accept it.

1026
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,150
As long as it is useful,

1027
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:21,310
and of your liking,

1028
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,070
it's worth it.

1029
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:27,050
Take it.

1030
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,260
(Speech Contest First Prize)

1031
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,760
Brother,

1032
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,670
did you watch Flower Fairy yesterday?

1033
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,160
Jiayue,

1034
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,880
don't leave keys outside.

1035
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,840
My mom told me

1036
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,280
that keys should be kept inside.

1037
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,670
Don't let bad guys see them.

1038
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,480
I got it, Brother Xiao Han.

1039
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,190
See you at the secret base tonight.

1040
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:49,450
I'm off to school.

1041
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,740
See you tonight.

1042
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,780
(Puyang New Village)

1043
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,880
Brother Xiao Han,

1044
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,710
do you know why I work so hard

1045
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,480
to get into

1046
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,300
No. 2 Middle School?

1047
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,580
I know.

1048
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:24,700
(End of Episode 1)

1049
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:30,160
I heard those shoes I bought last year

1050
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,250
were broken in just a few days.

1051
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:35,920
That's really bad.

1052
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:38,420
It was so embarrassing.

1053
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,600
This year's shoes

1054
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:41,070
are of good quality,

1055
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,030
I promise.

1056
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:44,760
They're not expensive.

1057
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,320
They're stuff for disposal,

1058
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,550
just knock-offs.

1059
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:53,500
Thank you.

1060
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,320
Are you canceling

1061
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,090
the meal in Fuguilou Restaurant.

1062
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:03,030
Cancel?

1063
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:04,400
Why would I cancel?

1064
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:07,760
Jiayue said she won't go.

1065
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:10,180
The main character won't go,

1066
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:12,510
and why are you holding it?

1067
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,730
My Baby is sensible.

1068
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:17,710
She might just be saying that.

1069
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,480
She won't skip it.

1070
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:27,190
How do you know
she refused to go?

1071
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,760
Ka Men told you?

1072
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,880
Thanks, Pei. No need to pay me extra.

1073
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,550
