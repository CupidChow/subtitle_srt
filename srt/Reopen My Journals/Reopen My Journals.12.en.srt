No peeking, Chang Wuji.

25
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,280
- Have you finished?
- All done!

26
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,400
- Hand it over.
- Get ready.

27
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,480
Ten seconds only.

- All correct!

00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,600
Correct!

35
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,150
Who brought a phone book?

36
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,680
- A phone book.
- I have one!

37
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,000
Pick a random page for him.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,400
How is his brain so sharp?

39
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,070
Hurry up, test him with the phone book.

40
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:06,910
Here.

41
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,350

5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

Stop shaking, I can't see clearly.

44
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,150
Wait. Last time there were 13 digits,

45
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,120
but this time only 8.

46
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,400
We haven't told him
which one to memorize.

47
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,240
True.

48
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,870
The first is 0793837018.

49
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,310

- Is that right?
- All correct!

52
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,560
All three memorized!

53
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,940
Amazing!

54
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,030
I didn't remember anything.

55
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,080
Chang Wuji, you only looked once,

56
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,590
and you remembered over 20 numbers!

57
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,000
Maybe I should donate my brain.

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,080
Chang Wuji,

59
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,400
you're definitely going to win.

60
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,140
Treat us to a big meal
with the prize money!

61
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,400
That's a must.

62
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,960
Why are you always thinking about food?

63
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,520
I just love food. What?

64
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,720
You only think about studying!

65
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,520
I… I…

66
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,190
You what?

67
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,870
Besides studying, I can eat too.

68
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,520
Very impressive.

69
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,310
That's true.

70
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,640
Continue.

71
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,750
- Wait…
- Brother Xiao Han.

72
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,120
Happy Birthday!

73
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,680
May you happiness and longevity!

74
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,590
What a surprise!

75
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,920
Go on!

76
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,190

77

Xiao Han, Happy Birthday!

78
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,150
Happy Birth…

79
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,360
You were preparing behind my back?

80
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,470
Some, you don't need to teach.

81
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,400
Some, you can't teach.

82

(Loner Xiao, Happy Birthday!

83
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,360
Thanks, everyone.

84
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,750
- He's embarrassed.
- Didn't we...

85
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,590
agree on the sixth day
of the first Chinese calendar month?

86
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,960
Treat! Treat! Treat!

87
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,870
Who's treating?

88
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,000
Xiao Han is treating!

89
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,850
Xiao Han is treating.

90
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,470
Alright, alright, treating is fine.

91
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,360
But finals are coming up,

92
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,280
we need all the time to study.

93
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,520
Let me think.

94
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,870
Computer training,

95
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,470
winter vacation, Chinese New Year…

96
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,590
The sixth day of
the first Chinese calendar month.

97
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,470
On the sixth,

98
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,910
I invite you to my place
for dinner.

99
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:44,750
- Sounds good.
- Great!

100
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,620
Set for the sixth.

101
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,780
- Are you sure?
- No problem!

102
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,680
- Settled?
- Everyone has to come, on the sixth.

103
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,120
See you all on the sixth!

104
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,920
Qian Jiayue told us that

105
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,640
even though the celebration is later,

106
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,350
today is your real birthday.

107
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,190
So, she asked us

108
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,150
to prepare a card for you in advance.

109
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,680
The card comes first,

110
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,870
but the gift comes after we've eaten.

111
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,520
I'll be looking forward to them

112
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,710
in the next two weeks.

113
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,540
The pressure's on.

114
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,520
Higher the expectation,
greater the disappointment.

115
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,290
You don't need to
prepare anything special.

116
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,640
If everyone does well in the finals

117
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,510
and enjoys the vacation,

118
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,230
that will be
the best birthday gift for me.

119
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,590
- As expected from the student council…
- Well said.

120
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,870
Well said.

121
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,390
Have some restraint.

122
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,160
Focus on the exams.

123
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,720
No problem.

124
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,510
See... See you.

129
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,400

130
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,640
8.

131
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,520
1.

132
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,030
2.

133
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,350
Qian Kang,

134
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,190
aren't you driving today?

135
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,360
The New Year's almost here,

136
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,560
so I'm doing a big cleaning.

137
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,390
I'm worried you and Xiu'e
might get tired.

138
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,290
You did the exercise
really well just now.

139
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,120
Is there anything I can help clean up?

140
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,590
No, I've already finished everything.

141
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,590
Mom,

142
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,110
for this New Year, I want…

143
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,110
Honey.

144
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,640
Honey,

145
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,430
do you think this outfit
looks good on me?

146
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,000
You look great in anything.

147
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,120
I'll talk about it later.

148
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,800
At home,

149
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,920
don't dress like a siren.

150
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,680
Help Qian Kang with some chores.

151
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,560
Got it, Mom.

152
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,440
Mom,

153
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,240
you look so graceful when you shake.

154
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,720
But your neck should move like this.

155
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,720
I'm doing exercises, not dancing.

156
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,510
Oh, you're exercising?

157
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,070
It looks just like dancing.

158
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,680
What do you want?

159
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,230
Mom,

160
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,440
I remember

161
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,040
Chen Jianguo

162
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,270
gave you an Omega watch,

163
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,950
but I never see you wear it.

164
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,020
What are you trying to say?

165
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,790
In a few days,

166
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,100
the old comrades from the countryside
are having a reunion.

167
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,160
Mom, you don't know…

168
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,630
- they're all dressed up...
- I know.

169
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,480
You want to show off

170
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,320
the watch

171
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,600
in front of your old comrades,

172
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,440
right?

173
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,440
Mom,

174
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,560
since you don't wear it,

175
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,600
can I borrow it for a bit?

176
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,520
Chen Xiu'e,

177
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,800
when you meet your old comrades,

178
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,360
why not focus on your comradeship,

179
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,000
remembering the hardships
you went through?

180
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,540
Seriously,

181
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,680
it wasn't easy,

182
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,920
it's precious.

183
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,070
What are you doing now?

184
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,480
Showing off

185
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,360
a luxury watch

186
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,430
and acting rich?

187
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,390
Honestly, you're damaging

188
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,510
the revolutionary spirit
between comrades!

189
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,920
I won't lend it to you.

190
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,160
I won't support your

191
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,000
vanity!

192
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,510
Vanity?

193
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,600
I just wanted to
borrow your watch for a bit.

194
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,680
Why make it such a big deal,

195
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,600
holding a struggle session.

196
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,620
- Yes, a struggle session.
- Fine, I don't need it.

197
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,000
I don't want it!

198
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,750
The computer's broken!

199
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,680
The millennium bug!

200
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,000
Honey, is it broken?

201
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:23,830
Oh, the computer.

202
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:24,690
No, no, it's not that.

203
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,750
I'm mopping the floor,

204
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,270
I accidentally knocked into this,

205
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,190
and it fell down.

206
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,030
See?

207
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,920
It should be fine.

208
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,760
Let me take a look.

209
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:41,790
What's this?

210
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,640
Go out.

211
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,150
Put it back.

212
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,110
Out.

213
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,510
- Don't read it.
- Out.

214
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,920
Close the door.

215
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,120
It's in English.

216
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,670
The drawing's really nice.

217
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:16,800
Baby,

218
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,070
I'm not reading your diary.

219
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,510
I just wanted to check

220
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,390
if your handwriting's improved,

221
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,310
and if your writing's good.

222
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm not trying to read the content.

223
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,840
Right?

224
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,720
I almost made a mistake again.

225
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,160
Baby,

226
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,440
I didn't read it.

227
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,550
I'm putting it back now.

228
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,560
Coming!

229
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,590
Kang.

230
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,350
Qiming.

231
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,510
Give me a hand.

232
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,600
How are you carrying all of that

233
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,440
by yourself?

234
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,670
It's not much, really.

235
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,510
You're too kind.

236
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,910
Don't say that, you're making me

237
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,790
feel like you're the one
being too kind.

238
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,120
Come on, come in.

239
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,390
Aren't you driving today?

240
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,510
I took a break.

241
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,530
- Auntie?
- Qiming's here!

242
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,550
Little San's here?

243
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,360
You look so elegant!

244
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,540
This color looks great on you!

245
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,680
Zhang Qiming.

246
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,750
You bought so many things!

247
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,610
Spending money on you

248
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:14,600
makes me happy!

249
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,120
No need. You're wasting too much money.

250
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,440
Not at all. Where's Jiayue?

251
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:20,320
She's at Chen Mo's place studying.

252
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,120
Your son's there too.

253
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,640
That little imp finally decided
to study hard, huh?

254
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,710
That's good.

255
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,120
Xiao Han's helping him study.

256
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,760
Aren't you happy? Someone's helping
take care of your son for free.

257
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,080
We're family.
Naturally we help each other out.

258
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,200
That's hilarious!

259
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,750
You're already family?

260
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,120
Zhang Qiming, you're really good
at calculating!

261
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,600
You must have forgotten,

262
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,550
you and Yang Min aren't divorced yet?

263
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,720
Auntie, stop joking about it.

264
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,720
She's really a mood killer.

265
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,750
That marriage exists in name only.

266
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,600
You're really annoying

267
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:55,550
bringing her up.

268
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,800
You're right.

269
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,670
Auntie, this is for you. Dongpo tea cake.

270
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,000
- It's really good.
- I noticed.

271
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,890
Four different colors.

272
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,320
Four varieties.

276
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,390

Please submit your papers.

278

279
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,840
- Bye.
- Bye.

280
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,110
Ka Men,

281
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,120
the answers to
of question…

282
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,960
No, no, no!

283
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,150
Don't discuss the answers.

284
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,600
Why?

285
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,080
Qian Jiayue always thinks that

286
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,140
if she doesn't discuss the answers
after the exam,

287
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,120
her answers will be correct.

288
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,510
So superstitious?

289
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,150
Fine, no discussion.
Let's head to Xidian Mall!

290
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,200
Sure.

291
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,720
Qian Jiayue, let's go.

292
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,670
Didn't you want to buy Xiao Han
a birthday gift?

293
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,270
I haven't decided what to get yet.

294
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,720
Besides, I have something else to do.

295
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,960
You guys go ahead.

296
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,720
Something else?

297
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,910
What do you need to do?

298
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,790
Alright, alright, we'll go.

299
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,630
Let's go!

300
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,020
- We're leaving now.
- Qian Jiayue…

301
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,870
Chang Wuji!

302
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,270
Do you have time?

303
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,710
What's up?

304
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:46,710
It's like this.

305
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,720
There's a column in the school journal
called "Campus Influential Figures".

306
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,870
Since you've been on a TV show recently,

307
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,480
and because I didn't do well
in the last interview,

308
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,240
can I get another chance?

309
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,960
Sure.

310
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,630
Are you having a stomachache again?

311
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,840
Can we talk while I eat?

312
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,890
(Jiale Wontons)
It's hot. Take your time.

313
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,920
Thank you, Mrs. Xiao.

314
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,960
Thanks, Mrs. Xiao.

315
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,030
You go ahead and eat.

316
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,550
He's right here in my restaurant.

317
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,910
Let me show you something.

318
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,960
Come in.

319
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,350
Stand in a row.

320
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,470
Here.

In the flesh!

322
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,200
It's really him!

323
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,960
He's the student
from "Digital Challenge Arena"!

324
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,320
Let me introduce him.

325
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,840
This is Chang Wuji.

326
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,670
He's my daughter Qing's classmate.

327
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,150
Chang, could you share

328
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,390
how you usually think?

329
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,480
If my kid had your brain,

330
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,870
everyone would envy me!

331
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,840
Please teach us. Say something.

332
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,790
Little genius, just say a few words.

333
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,360
Yes, yes, please!

334
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,270
Mrs. Liu,

335
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,240
his stomach's not feeling well.

336
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,600
Could he eat something first?

337
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,590
Stomach issues?

338
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,320
No problem! Eating's the priority!

339
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,270
- Retreat!
- Come on, tell us!

340
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,270
Alright, alright,

341
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,670
there'll be another chance.

342
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,120
Hurry up,

343
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,000
let him eat.

344
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,030
Aiping,

345
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,600
his meal is on the house!

346
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,510
Enjoy, little genius.

347
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,350
Thank you, Auntie.

348
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,360
Sorry for the interruption.

349
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:20,910
Thank you, Mrs. Xiao.

350
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,390
- No problem.
- Thank you, Mrs. Xiao.

351
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,600
Sorry about that, Chang Wuji.

352
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,910
This place is familiar,

353
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,000
so I brought you here.

354
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,630
Didn't realize you'd become
such a big star now.

355
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,560
It's alright,

356
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,320
I haven't had hot wontons in ages.

357
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,160
It's great.

358
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,750
Does your family know about
your stomach problems?

359
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,960
They're too busy with mahjong.

360
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,670
Take better care of your health.

361
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,390
Make sure you eat on time.

362
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,840
Go ahead and eat.

363
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,920
Alright.

364
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,390
It's a bit hot.

365
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,960
You can continue asking.

366
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,080
Okay.

367
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,630
You told me before that

368
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,750
it was your parents
who sent you to the competition.

369
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,940
Now that you've succeeded
in the challenge…

Honey,

373
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,360
why are you home so early?

374
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,440
Finished with work already?

375
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,150
I carried a few
long-distance passengers today,

376
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,590
so I've completed the workload.

377
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,200
I came back to cook.

378
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,550
Did you earn a lot?

379
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,870
It's not bad.

380
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,200
Xiu'e.

381
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,750
You must be tired. Take a break.

382
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,750
We'll chat later. Later.

383
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,800
Take a break now?

384
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,920
Honey,

385
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,600
thank you. I'll go rest for a bit.

386
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,920
Later, we'll have something nice to eat.

387
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,200
Have some soup.

388
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:11,230
Xiu'e.

389
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:12,710
Mom.

390
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,240
What are the plans
for this year's Spring Festival?

391
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,920
Spring Festival?

392
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,710
Godmother,

393
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,030
my dad said

394
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,290
we're having New Year's Eve dinner
at a restaurant,

395
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,200
his treat.

396
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,960
Your dad's rich now,

397
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,120
so generous!

398
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,750
We'll get some benefits too.

399
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,360
Yes, yes.

400
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,590
Honey,

401
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,190
don't make plans for the second day
of the Chinese New Year.

402
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,360
Mom's already arranged

403
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,400
to visit an aunt in Pudong
for New Year's greetings.

404
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,350
On the fourth day,

405
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,960
the Shen family is coming to visit.

406
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,290
You should all be home that day.

407
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:44,550
Xiu'e...

408
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,670
Also, I'll call Fen

409
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,120
and the grandma from the Xijiao Park

410
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,790
to confirm the arrangements,

411
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,960
then let you know.

412
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,440
Actually, for the Spring Festival,

413
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,840
I was planning to...

414
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,680
Mom,

415
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
don't schedule anything for me
on the sixth.

416
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,440
The sixth?

417
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,440
What's going on?

418
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,870
It's Brother Xiao Han's birthday.

419
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,260
We're going to celebrate it for him.

420
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:04,750
Xiao Han?

421
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,960
I thought his birthday already passed.

422
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,200
Mao Tou,

423
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,510
the other day,

424
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,880
your dad, showing off,

425
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,080
bought an ice cream cake.

426
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,080
Eating that in the winter,
doesn't he fear

427
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,430
his teeth freezing off?

428
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,280
Yeah,

429
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,840
that day, only a few of us were home,

430
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,200
and we had a simple meal.

431
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,640
But they've already planned to celebrate

432
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:27,390
Brother Xiao Han's birthday
officially on the sixth.

433
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,270
Celebrating a birthday
after the year changes?

434
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,630
Is that really necessary?

435
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,110
Yes, it is necessary.

436
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,230
Honey,

437
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,550
don't schedule anything
for our baby on the sixth.

438
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:49,420
(Yingmo Community)

439
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:53,060
(Mao Tou's Home - Idle People Keep Away)

440
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,920
Where did the letter go?

441
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:41,420
(Recipient: Zhang Qiming)

442
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:08,870
You can never find it

443
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,790
when you need it.

444
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,720
Yang Min,

445
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,310
before she went to Japan,

446
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,200
was fooling around with other men

447
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,240
and said she wanted to divorce me.

448
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,640
I was angry,

449
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,200
and of course, didn't agree.

450
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,040
I kept delaying it.

451
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,760
Now…

452
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,110
I'm facing the consequences.

453
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,480
The divorce paper she sent me,

454
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,510
I can't find it anymore.

455
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,310
Now, if I want a divorce,

456
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,790
I have to go beg her.

457
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,680
Is this karma?

458
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,590
You were going back and forth just now

459
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,980
because you argued with Xiu'e?

460
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,350
No.

461
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,200
Then why?

462
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,670
My family in Jiangxi

463
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,640
has called me multiple times,

464
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,880
saying I have to come home
for this year's Spring Festival.

465
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,820
I'm the eldest son,

466
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,340
and I haven't been back in five years.

467
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,750
My dad is so angry.

468
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,400
If I don't go back this year,

469
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,960
he'll sever ties with me.

470
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,830
But you know Xiu'e...

471
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,760
her temperament…

472
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,000
I can't convince her.

473
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,790
Our hometown is very patriarchal

474
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,880
my family has a bias against Xiu'e.

475
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,070
They can't get along,

476
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,740
and they fight every time they meet.

477
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,760
It's always been this way.

478
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,240
Xiu'e decided not to go back,

479
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,860
but it's been five years now.

480
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,640
No matter what,

481
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,630
not going back for five years

482
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,590
is her fault.

483
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,030
Women can be hard to deal with.

484
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,440
When you give her opinion,

485
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,160
she would stress the facts.

486
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,790
You give her facts,

487
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,500
she counters with her opinion.

488
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,400
I still need to have
a serious talk with Xiu'e.

489
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,550
I need to explain things to her well.

490
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,630
How is it?

491
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,480
I've written everything you said,

492
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,090
except the part about your parents
always playing mahjong.

493
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,310
I thought about it
and decided not to include it.

494
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,440
Honestly, you don't need
to show it to me.

495
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,590
Just write whatever you like.

496
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,750
Everyone, please pack up.

497
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,920
The library is closing.

498
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:04,630
Alright.

499
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,790
It still needs revisions.

500
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,680
I'll show you the final draft.

501
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,630
Okay.

502
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,200
Aren't you packing up?

503
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,280
You go home first.

504
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:17,630
What about you?

505
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,200
When the lights go out,
I'll do an experiment.

506
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,550
What experiment?

507
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,510
I'll make a starry sky.

508
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:51,910
How is it?

509
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,760
They all left.

510
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,560
This

511
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:58,330
is a refrigerator shelf
I brought from home.

512
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,640
This star map was printed earlier.

513
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,760
Right now,

514
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,030
it's flat.

515
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,200
After I shine the light on it…

516
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,440
and let it pass through
the transparent film to diffract…

517
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,710
it should become a 3D starry sky.

518
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:13,920
Are you ready?

519
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,480
It really showed up!

520
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,000
Try a different angle!

521
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,840
Okay.

522
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,030
This is amazing!

523
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,440
It's visible from all directions.

524
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:36,920
This is so cool!

525
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,040
Chang Wuji,

526
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,350
can we make it move?

527
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,740
(Puyang Road)

528
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,480
Xiu'e.

529
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:53,670
Auntie.

530
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,510
You look gorgeous today!

531
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,440
Do I?

532
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,640
Yes, yes!

533
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,550
Thank you!

534
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:07,910
Xiu'e.

535
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,480
Sister, forty wontons.

536
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,590
Got it.

537
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:22,030
You just finished gathering
with your sisters, didn't you?

538
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,240
Look at her, so happy.

539
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,640
She definitely
showed off big time, right?

540
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:27,960
Of course.

541
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,590
At the last gathering,

542
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,220
they all showed off their gold rings,
necklaces, and bracelets.

543
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:35,350
It's like they were subtly reminding me

544
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,320
that I married

545
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,270
a man from another place

546
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,440
who drives a taxi

547
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,510
and isn't very clever.

548
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,960
This time, I just wanted to show them

549
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,830
that my Qian Kang is
the best husband.

550
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,240
Fine, fine.

551
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,590
Your Qian Kang,

552
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,240
the best husband, got it.

553
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,640
The best thing

554
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,160
in my life is

555
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,350
marrying a good man

556
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,550
and having a good daughter.

557
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,590
How sweet!

558
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:15,910
Xiu'e,

559
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,920
what are your plans
for the Spring Festival

560
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,110
with your best husband, Qian Kang?

561
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,640
What plans?

562
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,550
Just normal plans.

563
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,400
Aren't you planning
to go back to his hometown?

564
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,030
It's been a few years
since you've gone back.

565
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,000
That's right.

566
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,640
I'm not going back.

567
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,680
Why should I go?

568
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,460
I don't have anything to say
to those people.

569
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,160
Don't you know?

570
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,830
When I just gave birth,

571
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:45,200
his parents came to the hospital, saw

572
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,920
it was a girl,

573
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,000
and turned around and left.

574
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,440
When I was in confinement,

575
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,720
my Qian Kang got up at 5 AM every day

576
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,510
to cook breakfast for me,

577
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,030
and after he came home from work,

578
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,950
he still had to wash
a big basin of diapers.

579
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:00,440
He lost 2.5 kilograms during that time!

580
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:01,920
Yet his parents

581
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,590
never even came to visit me once.

582
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,350
It's really heart-wrenching
to think about it.

583
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:08,950
That's true.

584
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:13,030
But then again, no matter what,

585
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,790
he still

586
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:17,440
- has his parents and brothers back home.
- That's right.

587
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,030
He's definitely going to miss his family.

588
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:19,880
Yes, definitely.

589
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,620
Look,

590
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,830
Qian Kang is

591
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,680
the best husband for you,

592
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,790
but if he never
goes back to his hometown,

593
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:30,070
he can't be the best son.

594
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,270
Exactly!

595
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,070
He must feel bad inside.

596
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,510
I'm not stopping him.

597
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,880
He can go back if he wants.

598
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,310
I've got a lot
to do in Shanghai.

599
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,680
My hands are full.

600
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:43,070
Sister, are the wontons ready?

601
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,000
They're coming.

602
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,070
I need to go home and make dinner now.

603
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,070
This early?

604
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,560
Your wontons.

605
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,030
Don't forget to keep tab.

606
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:54,870
Got it.

607
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,240
Bye.

608
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,790
This Chen Xiu'e,

609
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,240
how stubborn she is.

610
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,510
What can you do about her?

611
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:12,440
Zhang Qiming asked me
to try and talk to her.

612
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,920
I really don't know how to start.

613
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,080
Yeah.

614
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:17,960
Qian Kang would

615
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:21,030
only dare to drink with Zhang to vent,

616
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,350
he wouldn't talk to Xiu'e
about these things!

617
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:26,440
We really can't say much either.

618
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:28,640
Just drop hints.

619
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,700
Where's my Omega?

620
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,540
I'm back.

621
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,040
Mom!

622
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,590
You peeked at my diary again!

623
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,510
Baby,

624
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,310
you can't blame everything on me.

625
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,590
Then why is my CD drive shell
upside down?

626
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,400
You must've touched it!

627
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,960
What's going on with you?

628
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,070
Didn't you promise not to read her diary?

629
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,350
Why are you repeating this bad habit?

630
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:00,830
What habit?

631
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,440
Am I a criminal?

632
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,400
Bad habit? Baby,

633
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,830
I did find

634
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,070
your little notebook

635
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,400
in that...

636
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,440
case,

637
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,030
but I didn't

638
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,110
read your diary.

639
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,240
If you don't believe me, I swear.

640
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,080
Listen,

641
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,080
I swear

642
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,240
I didn't read my baby's diary.

643
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,520
Don't move!

644
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,430
Chen Xiu'e,

645
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,680
how did my watch end up here?

646
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,110
No wonder I couldn't find it earlier!

647
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,000
You really have no boundaries, do you?

648
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,140
Not only did you sneak peek at
your daughter's diary,

649
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,550
but now you've stolen my watch!

650
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,960
Who stole your watch?

651
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,070
That's ridiculous!

652
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,990
Just because it's an Omega,

653
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
it is yours?

654
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:45,240
I borrowed it from Fangfang, okay?

655
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,350
Nonsense!

656
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,030
I caught you red-handed,

657
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,310
and you're still denying it?

658
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,640
You...

659
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,240
For the sake of vanity,

660
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,400
you'll do anything!

661
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,310
How am I being vain?

662
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,000
I haven't even entered your room

663
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,720
these past few days.

664
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:06,070
There are only four of us living here:

665
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,640
me, Baby,

666
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:08,630
Qian Kang.

667
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,880
Who else could it be?

668
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:10,910
Who else?

669
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,440
You're my daughter,

670
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,480
I know your nature.

671
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:18,440
When your mom was in elementary school,

672
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,030
she once stole money from home
to buy candy,

673
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,590
then traded the candy for marbles.

674
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,480
Didn't that happen?

675
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,400
Wasn't it you?

676
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,240
You?!

677
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:29,000
Why are you always
bringing up that story?

678
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,830
I... I'm vain?

679
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,200
I steal your stuff?

680
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,920
Can I even steal your stuff?

681
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,960
You treat me like

682
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,000
a spy!

683
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,440
How could I steal from you?

684
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,790
You're always misplacing things.

685
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:43,880
I think you're just

686
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,000
getting forgetful.

687
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,440
Maybe you're developing dementia!

688
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,480
Mom!

689
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,200
How can you say that about Granny?

690
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,120
You should give her back the watch!

691
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,640
I read your diary?

692
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,110
I stole your watch?

693
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,200
You better take a good look,

694
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,000
is this watch really yours?

695
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,960
This is an Omega,
who else could it belong to?

696
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,000
- Of course, it's mine!
- It's not yours!

697
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,550
This watch is from Fangfang!

698
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,080
- No! You stole it!
- Liao Dongmei!

699
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,590
In this family, I'm not the thief,

700
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,480
you are!

701
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,400
I'm a thief?

702
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,310
What did I steal?

703
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,040
Fine,

704
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,270
I'll say it.

705
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,790
You stole my chance to enter the factory.

706
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:33,680
You stole my opportunity
to stay in Shanghai.

707
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,880
You stole my whole future!

708
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,110
You're talking nonsense!

709
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,480
How am I talking nonsense?

710
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,790
How am I talking nonsense?

711
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,110
I remember it clearly.

712
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,480
When I was 16,

713
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,590
my father wrote to me.

714
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:50,590
He told me I was the only daughter
in the family

715
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,310
and didn't need to go to the countryside.

716
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,440
The factory spot was mine.

717
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,590
I was happily waiting
to work at the factory.

718
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:57,830
Then you said to me,

719
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,350
"The factory spot has been canceled."

720
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,320
You sent me to live and work
in the countryside in Jiangxi.

721
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,920
You even said, "Young people

722
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,240
should accept hardship and labor,

723
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,030
and re-education from the farmers.

724
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:09,000
There are no factory spots left!"

725
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,240
I believed you.

726
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,510
I went to Jiangxi alone.

727
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,030
I took the train with all my things,

728
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,070
and you didn't even see me off!

729
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,760
Then?

730
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,160
Two years later,

731
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,440
Chen Jianjun got the spot
at No. 9 Factory.

732
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,830
You stole my spot

733
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,110
and gave it to your son!

734
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,110
You've always favored your sons.

735
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:54,200
They are always right,

736
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,920
and I'm always wrong.

737
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:59,030
I don't care about the food or drink,

738
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,480
but that factory spot

739
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,640
was my future,

740
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,110
my lifelong opportunity!

741
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,000
You schemed

742
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,590
to keep both sons in Shanghai.

743
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,430
And what happened?

744
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,440
They just left

745
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,830
for the U.S.

746
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:15,920
and earned dollars!

747
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,030
As for me?

748
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,070
I went to Jiangxi alone,

749
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,980
lived there for over ten years!

750
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:22,400
Every day I worked in the fields.

751
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,480
I bent over,

752
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,320
walked barefoot,

753
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:26,110
stepping through the mud!

754
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,830
My legs were covered in leeches.

755
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,240
I was so thin, like a bamboo stick.

756
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,820
I was afraid the wind would blow me over.

757
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,680
I had nothing to eat.

758
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,680
All I had was
a White Rabbit milk candy.

759
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:44,030
I held it in my hand for weeks,

760
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,790
unwilling to eat it!

761
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,070
If it hadn't been for Qian Kang,

762
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,830
I wouldn't have found any reason
to keep living...

763
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,880
No meaning in life at all!

764
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,440
I stole from you?

765
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,960
How did I steal from you?

766
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,590
What did I steal from you?

767
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,840
Mom,

768
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,400
please stop.

769
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,360
Granny is upset.

770
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,480
Baby...

771
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:25,610
Baby.

772
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,880
She's upset,

773
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,880
but I'm heartbroken!

774
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,550
I thought,

775
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,710
my mother didn't love her daughter,

776
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,840
but now I have a precious daughter,

777
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,440
I will raise her like a princess.

778
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,840
I ditched my dignity!

779
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,030
I begged her to bring you back
to Shanghai.

780
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,230
The first day I returned to Shanghai...

781
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,190
I... I just wanted to hug you.

782
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,000
But you pushed me away.

783
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,440
You didn't want my hug.

784
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,280
When I let go of you,

785
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:00,590
you just... you just ran to her.

786
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,710
You didn't even

787
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,840
call me "Mom".

788
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:08,550
Why?

789
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,670
What did I do wrong?

790
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:13,760
What did I do to deserve this

791
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,110
from all of you?

792
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,350
Xiu'e,

793
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,320
the duck from Small Chongming
is really good.

794
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,480
I brought some back for you.

795
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:44,070
Eat it while it's warm.

796
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,320
Afterward,

797
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,360
I'll go for a night shift.

798
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,760
Xiu'e?

799
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:50,910
Qian Kang,

800
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,590
Xiu'e went out.

801
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,190
You need to go find her!

802
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:56,760
Went out? Where did she go?

803
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,510
I'm truly sorry.

804
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,840
I thought

805
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,320
Xiu'e took my watch,

806
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,160
but it was here with me!

807
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:06,110
I wronged her.

808
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:08,360
Dad. Mom cried when she went out.

809
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:09,880
And because of this, I...

810
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,120
I went out to look for her,
but I couldn't find her!

811
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,920
I'll go find her!
How long has she been gone?

812
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,400
Almost three hours.

813
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,240
Three hours?

814
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,280
Jiayue,

815
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,190
I knocked over the shell when I was

816
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,230
cleaning the other time.

817
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,320
She promised not to read it.

818
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,460
You should trust her.

819
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,760
I'll go find her.

820
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,240
Dad, I'll go with you!

821
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,710
Stay here with Granny.

822
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,030
Don't worry, I'll find her.

823
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:39,980
(Yingmo Community)

824
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:44,950
Xiu'e!

825
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,350
Xiu'e!

826
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,070
Xiu'e!

827
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,240
Xiu'e!

828
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,030
Honey.

829
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,680
Xiu'e!

830
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,670
It's freezing!

831
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,920
- Look at you.
- I'm frozen!

832
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,940
You're not dressed warmly!

833
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,030
I've been calling for you.

834
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,510
Why didn't you answer?

835
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:24,400
Come on, let's go back.

836
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:28,110
The watch was found.

837
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,440
Mom's really worried.

838
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,760
She asked me to find you.

839
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,150
Let's go back!

840
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,390
I'm not going back.

841
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,000
Now she realizes she wronged me?

842
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,320
Yes, she knows.

843
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,760
Don't hold a grudge.

844
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,880
Let's go back.

845
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,840
She's always like this!

846
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,640
One moment

847
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,030
she says I stole her things,

848
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:51,400
the next she says
I forgot to turn off the stove.

849
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:55,190
She's old and forgetful.

850
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,510
She's your mom.

851
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:58,420
It's not a big deal
if she scolds you a little.

852
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,070
Don't be upset.

853
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:01,960
How can I not be upset?

854
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,590
My own mom doesn't love me.

855
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,150
Your parents don't like me either.

856
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,760
They blame me for not listening,

857
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,480
for not doing housework well,

858
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:14,460
and

859
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,180
for not giving them a grandson.

860
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,630
They just don't like me.

861
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:18,540
That's not true.

862
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:19,670
About the grandson,

863
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,320
we're just responding
to the country's call.

864
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,790
We could if we want to.

865
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,340
Your mom were againt us as well.

866
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,760
She even came to Jiangxi by train

867
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,000
and said to you,

868
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,230
"If you marry him,

869
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:31,760
you'll never come back to Shanghai.

870
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,590
You'll be a farmer in Jiangxi forever!"

871
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,800
And then you said...

872
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:36,630
"Even if I'm a farmer

873
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:38,000
in Jiangxi forever, so what?

874
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,840
As long as Qian Kang treats me well,

875
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,670
I'll never go back to Shanghai."

876
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:46,550
Don't be upset.

877
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:47,670
Let's go home.

878
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,030
Come on.

879
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,840
It's late.

880
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:53,710
Aren't you hungry?

881
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,480
I bought duck.

882
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,590
We need to hurry,

883
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,800
or they'll eat it all.

884
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,520
Let's go! Come on.

885
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,630
No.

886
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,000
I'm not going back.

887
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,280
Sooner or later, she'll just

888
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:06,960
wrong me and bully me again.

889
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,510
Not going back?

890
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,670
Are you going to

891
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,760
sleep on the street?

892
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:16,510
Or...

893
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,150
should we get a room?

894
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,710
Get a room? How expensive!

895
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,960
With that money, you might as well...

896
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,800
Buy... what?

897
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,920
A pair of shoes.

898
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,030
Honey,

899
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:43,880
I want a new pair of shoes
for the Chinese New Year,

900
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,150
but I've always hesitated.

901
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,960
It's on the second floor of the mall.

902
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,760
Every time I pass by,

903
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,540
I go try them on.

904
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,700
I've tried them so many times,

905
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,760
but I never bought them.

906
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,600
Too expensive.

907
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:55,070
Buy them!

908
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:56,960
Never mind the price!

909
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,150
It's over 500 yuan.

910
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,800
I'll buy them for you.

911
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,110
Just come home with me.

912
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,190
If you buy me the shoes,

913
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,440
I'll definitely come home.

914
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:10,190
They're soft leather shoes,
over 500 yuan.

915
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,540
Has she ever seen anything like it?

916
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,680
Let's go!

917
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,670
We'll buy the shoes!

918
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,880
- Really?
- Let's go.

919
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:16,000
Really. We'll buy the shoes!

920
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,880
- Honey, let me tell you...
- Let's go.

921
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,070
We're back.

922
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,070
Found your watch?

923
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,710
I'll heat it up for you.

924
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,280
Here.

925
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:05,630
If you ever want candy,

926
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:06,960
just tell me.

927
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,480
Mom, I'll help with dinner.

928
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,150
I'm coming!

929
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:56,500
