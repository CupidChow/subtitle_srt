00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,240
it's

31
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,560

A while ago,

35
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,760
when I closed my eyes at night,

36
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,040
as if I could hear

37
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,800
the sound of the machines
clanking beside my ears,

38
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,280

how I could give everyone an explanation,

43
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,430

It's clear she

189
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,150
holds herself to high standards.

190
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,480
Mr. Zhou,

191
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,960
I'm worried that her high standards

192
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,510
might create too much pressure.

193
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,030
I've noticed that since she started here,

194
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,510
her mood hasn't

195
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,030
been very good.

196
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,080
Please,

197
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,270
sit down. Let's talk this through.

198
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,080
Thank you. Thank you.

199
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,440
I see now.

200
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,670
The things is,

201
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,270
for a student who has been
excellent for so long,

202
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,910
when entering a better environment,

203
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,750
it is

204
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,270
completely normal for her

205
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,440
to feel lost.

206
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,300
Don't worry,

207
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,140
this is the stage
where both school and family

208
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,670
need to collaborate

209
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,720
and provide her the necessary support.

210
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,240
Mr. Zhou, you're such a great teacher!

211
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,030
We were thinking the same thing.

212
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,240
I want

213
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,840
Jiayue to find something she's good at

214
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,320
to build her confidence.

215
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,630
So, I was wondering

216
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,960
if the school journal

217
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,080
could publish her article.

218
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,240
That's a great idea.

219
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,510
Has she submitted it?

220
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,960
Yes, she just submitted it.

221
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,440
Mr. Zhou, I've read it,

222
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,270
and it's really well written.

223
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,150
She wrote about her classmates,

224
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,320
No. 9 Factory,

225
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,480
the neighborhood, and even

226
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,510
the newly opened
No. 9 Factory Memorial Museum.

227
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,720
Are you talking about Qian Jiayue?

228
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,960
Yes, miss!

229
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,440
Let me introduce you.

230
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,960
Miss Yan who teaches Chinese language.

231
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,720
And Qian Jiayue's mother.

232
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:21,630
Hello, Miss Yan.

233
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,840
I'm Jiayue's mother.

234
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,240
You know what?

235
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,720
Miss Yan is the person
in charge of the school journal.

236
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,270
The article was really well written.

237
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,840
So, Miss Yan,

238
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,510
why hasn't it been published?

239
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,620
When she submitted it,

240
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,080
we had already finished
printing this issue,

241
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,140
so it couldn't be included.

242
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,340
It should be in the next issue.

243
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,080
It'll be published?

244
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,240
I see now!

245
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,960
Miss Yan, I remember you have

246
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,870
a friend who works
at Wenhui Daily, right?

247
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,000
Don't they often ask

248
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,610
students to write reports?

249
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,870
You're right.

250
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,550
I'll ask them tomorrow.

251
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,720
The No. 9 Factory Memorial Museum opening

252
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,910
is a social news topic,

253
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,490
and they might be willing to publish it.

254
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,600
- Thank you so much!
- Thank you then.

255
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,380
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

256
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,960
I heard the school journal
is recruiting, right?

257
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,960
Yes. Jiayue can give it a try.

258
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,720
Go talk to Qian Jiayue.

259
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,870
Tell her that Miss Yan

260
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:15,240
and I strongly encourage her to apply for

261
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,080
the school journal reporter position.

262
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,480
Yes, she should try it.

263
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,480
School journal reporter?

264
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,320
Yes.

265
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,440
- Thank you, Miss Yan!
- You're welcome!

266
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,640
Thank you, Mr. Zhou! Thank you!

267
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,960
Really?

268
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,960
Mr. Zhou and Miss Yan
both think highly of you.

269
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,150
Baby, I've got a gift for you.

270
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,510
What's inside?

271
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,510
Open it and see.

272
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,240
Once you become a little reporter,

273
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,510
you'll spend more time
reading and writing.

274
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,670
I've heard this is good for your eyes.

275
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,870
See all those tiny holes?

276
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,710
That's...

277
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,550
Whatever its name is…

278
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,340
it's really beneficial
for your eyesight.

279
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,240
I can really see better!

280
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,390
So, make sure to wear it often.

281
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,360
Little reporter!

282
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,650
That's awesome!

283
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,740
I'm going to be a reporter!

284
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:15,740
(Shanghai Puyang No. 2 Middle School)

285
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,480
First of all, congratulations
to the 12 students here

286
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,720
who have passed

287
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,840
the first round
for our school journal "Striving".

288
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,090
Now, I'll announce

289
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,270
the format for the next round
of assessments.

290
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,550
The new century's just around the corner,

291
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,790
and your task will be

292
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,960
to write a photo-essay

293
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,440
on the theme

294
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,360
(New Century's Challenge)
"New Century's Challenge".

295
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,750
We will select

296
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,150
four outstanding essays

297
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,440
to be published in the next issue
of the journal.

298
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,320
These four authors

299
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,200
will also pass the final assessment

300
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,030
and become part of our new reporter team.

301
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,480
The sandstorm raged,

302
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,640
(1999, Welcoming the New Century)
and the monster charged at me,

303
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,480
knocking me to the ground.

304
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,840
I thought my life was over.

305
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,110
Just then,

306
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,720
the heroine pushed me aside

307
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,840
and stood in front of the monster.

308
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,910
With the same intensity
she used when scolding me.

309
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,510
With her sharp gaze,
she defeated the monster,

310
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,720
instantly changing the tide of battle.

311
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,120
So I believe,

312
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,870
even if the world is ending,

313
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,750
with this savior,

314
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,080
it won't be the end we are facing.

315
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:35,000
It will be a beginning of a new era.

316
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,840
Awesome!

317
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,070
What are you clapping for?

318
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,110
Are your hands itchy?

319
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,960
The essay

320
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,360
I assigned was supposed to be titled

321
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,510
"An Unforgettable Moment,"

322
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,350
right?

323
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,960
But this student gave me a subtitle

324
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,360
"The Birth of the Heroine".

325
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,870
I think you all know

326
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,120
who wrote this, right?

327
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,920
Zhang Yang,

328
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,280
stand up.

329
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,270
Zhang Yang,

330
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,240
the essay I asked you to write
was supposed

331
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,000
to describe real life

332
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,720
and the good people around you.

333
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,150
What is this?

334
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,960
Mr. Jiang, I was writing

335
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,440
about real-life events around me.

336
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,630
- Right?
- Yeah.

337
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,470
Yeah what?

338
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,750
You've met a heroine?

339
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,960
Forgive for saying this,

340
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,030
but some of our classmates,

341
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,120
especially the boys,

342
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,870
read those ridiculous comics all the time.

343
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,210
A man with seven knife scars?

344
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,600
No, no, Mr. Jiang,

345
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,640
it's not seven knife scars.

346
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,320
It's seven normal scars.

347
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,120
That's called the Big Dipper.

348
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,270
The Big Dipper?

349
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,440
Listen,

350
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,480
your essay needs to be rewritten.

351
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,840
Got it?!

Huh?

360

Why do you ask?

361
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,830
I'm applying for a reporter position
at the school journal.

362
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,790
The teacher gave us this topic.

363
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,590

I don't want it to sound childish,

364
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:21,310

just graduated from university

374
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,590
and started working.

375
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,460
As for challenges,

376
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,910
I can't think of many

377
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,880
because I tend to just dive into things.

378
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,950
I see.

379
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,240
Looks like you can't help me then.

380
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,540

Not necessarily.

382
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,750
I work as a magazine editor.

383
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,830
- However,
- A magazine editor?

384
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:14,880
to keep an air of mystery,

385
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,920
I won't tell you which magazine.

386
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,640
That's fine!

387
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,960
No wonder you sound so mature

388
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,310
and always speak so eloquently.

389
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,590
You're awesome!

390
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,920
Please give me some guidance!

Challenges

393
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,030
are things that
people always wanted to do

394
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,240
but never really did.

395
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,400
As for you high schoolers,

396
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,400
I'm not sure

397
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,170
what do you want to do

398
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,510
but haven't got the chance to.

399
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:49,180
Things I want to do
but haven't got the chance to?

but haven't gone the chance)

(Shanghai Puyang No. 2 Middle School)

402
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,240
Oh my gosh,

403
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,030
"the end of the world"?

404
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,000
Is that for real?

405
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:19,350
I heard it on the radio on 101.7 too.

406
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,030
How could it not be true?

407
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,440
It's written clearly in this book.

408
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:26,200
It was set 400 years ago,

409
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,040
okay?

410
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,920
On December 31, 1999,

411
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,550
around 9 PM,

412
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,240
the nine major planets
will form a giant cross.

413
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:36,070
At that moment, the Earth will explode,

414
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,790
and the universe will be destroyed.

415
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,480
Destroyed!

416
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,550
What the heck?!

417
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,110
Scared the life out of me.

418
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,950
Liu Jianfeng,

419
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,880
I heard, you were robbed recently

420
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,750
and got beaten up?

421
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,620
Was it those guys
from the neighboring school?

422
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,110
No way!

423
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,000
Do I look like

424
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,580
someone who gets beaten?

425
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,890
I beat them!

426
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,920
Remember? I used

427
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,830
the Dragon Claw technique,

428
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:01,670
and then...

429
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,510
I just stood up for justice

430
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,400
and helped out!

431
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,440
You get it?

432
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,270
A true hero has arrived!

433
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,720
- Brother Xiao Han!
- Xiao Han, we're waiting for you.

434
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,000
- Hurry up.
- Come on, Xiao Han.

435
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,200
Loner Xiao is the real deal.

436
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,720
He only targets the leader!

437
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:21,000
When catching robbers,
first catch their leader.

438
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,840
When fighting, it's the momentum
that matters.

439
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,310
As long as you put on a desperate act,

440
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,580
the momentum will come naturally.

441
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,390
Sounds like you really know
what you're talking about.

442
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,280
Of course.

443
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,140
Impressive!

444
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,070
- Let's go.
- Ka Men, what should I do?

445
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,920
I seriously can't figure out
what to write

446
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,200
for the school journal's

447
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,440
"New Century Challenge" topic.

448
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:40,800
- Right?
- Hurry up, Jiayue.

449
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:41,910
Okay!

450
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,590
What about him?

451
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:49,240
Why not challenge yourself?

452
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,140
Say the things
you want to say to him again.

453
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,320
Who knows, maybe the end of the world
really is coming.

454
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,290
Don't leave any regrets.

455

456
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,640
Thanks, Xiao Han.

457
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:00,920
If you finish school early next time,

458
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,790
could you help Meng
with his schoolwork again?

459
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,200
You don't need to be so polite with him.

460
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,270
My kid's schoolwork is really lacking.

461
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,250
Who is it?

462
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,390
It's me.

463
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,320
I'll get it.

464
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:14,630
Mr. Zhang?

465
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,920
- Mrs. Zhu.
- Come here, Zhu.

466
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,760
Mr. Zhang's here.

467
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,110
Come in and sit, Mr. Zhang.

468
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,480
Why are you standing? Come on in.

469
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,440
- Sit down inside.
- No need.

470
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,550
Came to pick someone up?

471
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,400
I was just out for a walk

472
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,790
and happened to pass by your apartment.

473
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,790
Such a coincidence.

474
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,310
Han, you're here too.

475
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,000
I was actually going to
ask your mom a favor.

476
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,960
Could you help Mao Tou
with his schoolwork?

477
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,690
What does he not understand this time?

478
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,070
What does he understand?

479
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,610
Please help him with his schoolwork.

480
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,800
Let's go.

481
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,740
Great.

482
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,310
Mr. and Mrs. Zhu, I'll head out now.

483
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,150
Alright.

484
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,640
- Take care.
- See you.

485
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,240
Drop by for tea when you have time.

486
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,080
Sure.

487
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,920
Come, come.

488
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,830
Please go inside.

489
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,190
Watch out.

490
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,270
Han, inside, please.

491
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,110
Mao Tou.

492
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,550
Mrs. Xiao.

493
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,150
Brother Xiao Han.

494
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,000
You've got some schoolwork
you don't understand?

495
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,790
There's a lot I don't understand.

496
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,760
Please help me.

497
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:17,750
Come on, hurry.

498
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,690
I really need your help.

499
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,390
Han, thanks for your help.

500
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,260
I'll go into his room.

501
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,400
What are you doing?

502
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,200
You know I'm with Han today.

503
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,590
He's not happy

504
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:36,870
to see you.

505
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,440
I've been quietly observing him,

506
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,140
he wasn't really that disgruntled.

507
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,390
Besides,

508
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:44,960
he's willing to help Mao Tou,

509
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,390
which means
he's quite fine with it.

510
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:48,950
Aiping,

511
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,920
I've thought about it.

512
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:54,240
When we encounter difficulties
we can't solve,

513
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:57,160
we can solve the person
who is creating the problems.

514
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,000
Right?

515
00:22:59,110 --> 00:22:59,950
I'm

516
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:03,110
ready for a long-term battle.

517
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,960
I... I will corrupt him.

518
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,690
No, I'll enlighten him.

519
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,440
Not exactly. I'm going to melt him,

520
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,960
like how spring breeze melts the snow.

521
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,310
I'll get you a cup of water.

522
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,400
What's the problem?

523
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,390
This.

524
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,390

525
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,240

526
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,510
When did you start learning this?

527
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,390
I...

528
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:29,870

My dad heard from his friend that

if you do well in Olympiad Math,

535
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,790
the math exam in zhongkao
will be easy.

536
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,670
Coincidentally, my dad

537
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,000
bought two sets. One for you, one for me.

538
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,160
You're learning Olympiad Math too,

539

Don't scold him.

00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,790
- Can you take a break in passing?
- Mom.

558
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:25,630
Let's go home.

559
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,160
So soon?

560
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,330
You're not feeling well today.

561
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,240
Go home and rest early.

562
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,220
I'm fine, just a little headache.

563
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,210
Alright, I'll throw out
the trash in passing.

564
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,110
That's not "in passing".

565
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:51,110
Can you take care of yourself properly?

566
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,030
Your face doesn't look good these days,

567
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,000
and you're working two jobs.

568
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,240
I'm worried about you...

569
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,400
You guys already finished?

570
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,160
Han, you know,

571
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,750
your mom's birthday is coming up.

572
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,840
How about

573
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,000
we all go out

574
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,160
and treat her to a nice meal.

575
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,350
Mr. Zhang,

576
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,670
there's no need to go out.

577
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,810
I've made my own plans for her birthday.

578
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,370
We won't trouble you.

579
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:27,540
And the Olympiad Math book,

580
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,440
I don't need it.

581
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,400
- Thank you.
- No worries.

582
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,240
Mao Tou, see you.

583
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:46,560
Safe home.

584
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:47,590
I'll see you off.

585
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,110
The revolution is not yet successful,

586
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:01,670
comrade,

587
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,020
you still need to work harder.

588
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,160
Comrade?

589
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,640
I'm your father!

590
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:08,350
You failed the one task I gave you.

591
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,750
Go do your homework now!

592
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,750
3.4 yuan per jin…

593
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,440
I gave him 10 yuan…

594
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,680
3.4 yuan…

595
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:46,940
(End of the world,
Turn disaster into fortune)

596
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:51,550
Bing,

597
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,960
why aren't you at the market?

598
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,400
Why are you here instead?

599
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,030
Adapt to the circumstances
and act in line with the chances.

600
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:00,200
This time, I've brought

601
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,400
some talismans from
the Sanqing taoist temple.

602
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,740
I don't believe in these things.

603
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,110
I'll see you later.

604
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,920
- Goodbye.
- How sad!

605
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:08,630
People,

606
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,390
when disaster strikes,

607
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:12,090
they only think about
food, drink, and fun,

608
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,790
they never want to improve
their own fortune.

609
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,440
Bing,

610
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,640
what are you talking about?

611
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,830
Please explain.

612
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,510
The age of decadence,

613
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,430
you know?

614
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,350
The end of the world,

615
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,350
the millennium bug…

616
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,740
You should know about these, right?

617
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,590
The end of the world?

618
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,260
I just heard about that.

619
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,110
What's this millennium bug?

620
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,720
The so-called millennium bug

621
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,720
is a bug that has cultivated
for a thousand years.

622
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,640
Cultivated for a thousand years,
but still a bug.

623
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,510
Ignorant!

624
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,590
This bug

625
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,680
is invisible and intangible.

626
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,620
What we're talking about
is the end of the world.

627
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,790
And this bug

628
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,550
is causing it!

629
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,860
It's 1999 now.

630
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,110
Do you know when this bug last appeared?

631
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,550
Once every thousand years…

632
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,240
999 AD.

633
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,830
999 AD!

634
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,830
What happened that year?

635
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,830
999 AD...

636
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,550
- What happened?
- What happened in 999 AD?

637
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,960
I'm not good at history.

638
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,440
In 999 AD,

639
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:14,950
the Khitan people

640
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,240
came south in full force,

641
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,630
and we fought them.

642
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,740
The fall of the Song Dynasty

643
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,650
was set in motion that year!

644
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:23,400
When this bug appears,

645
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,000
it signals war

646
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,200
and chaos!

647
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,830
War…

648
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,590
Now, the world seems peaceful.

649
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,590
But then came computers.

650
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,350
Computers!

651
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,860
The third world war
will starting right here!

652
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,110
When the millennium bug appears,

653
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:42,170
it will destroy all computers!

654
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,240
Sir, do you have a computer?

655
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,760
No, right?

656
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,760
That's good.

657
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:48,760
What about you, sir?

658
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,420
- Bing.
- None of you, right? That's good.

659
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,400
Bing. Bing!

660
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,550
I bought a computer

661
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,750
just recently!

662
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,720
You have a computer?

663
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:01,540
They'll ensure your safety.

664
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,750
These talismans?

665
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:08,780
(End of the world,
Turn disaster into fortune)

666
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,790
- I've packed it up for you.
- Thanks, Aiping.

667
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,160
Your wontons taste so good.

668
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,400
Momo never

669
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,400
gets enough of them.

670
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,590
Really skilled, huh?

671
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,190
Pei!

672
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,160
Xiu'e.

673
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,240
You're all here!

674
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,510
That's great!

675
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,590
Come over here.

676
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,310
I brought something good for you.

677
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,150
What's this?

678
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,980
Are you showing off something?

679
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,950
You know about
the end of the world, right?

680
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,720
And the millennium bug.

681
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:38,110
Stick it in the southeast corner
of your apartment.

682
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,720
No, wait,

683
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,550
it should be the southwest.

684
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,110
It'll protect your whole family

685
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,240
and get you through tough times.

686
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,350
I've bought one for each of you.

687
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,020
How about that for friendship?

688
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,440
Is that it?

689
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,310
Well… Xiu'e,

690
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,400
I'm a Party member,

691
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,680
and I'm an atheist.

692
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,510
This doesn't really seem appropriate.

693
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,110
Fangfang, I'm telling you,

694
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:07,200
there's a lot of wisdom behind this.

695
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,430
Fangfang,

696
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:12,000
do you have a computer at home?

697
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:12,950
We do.

698
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,790
Families with computers will be

699
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:18,310
especially unlucky this time.

700
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,720
Don't dismiss this.

701
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,200
The millennium bug

702
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,240
came from abroad.

703
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,790
It's said to appear
once every thousand years.

704
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,110
It's invisible!

705
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,400
This bug is invisible to us?

706
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,200
It appears once every thousand years!

707
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:38,160
The last time was in 999 AD.

708
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:39,830
What dynasty was it?

709
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,790
Doesn't matter. That year,

710
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,590
there was war. How terrifying.

711
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,720
So terrifying!

712
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,830
War!

713
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,670
Yes, exactly.

714
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:49,720
Oh, no.

715
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,750
Come on.

716
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,560
Aiping,

717
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,960
you've always had bad luck.

718
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,310
You really should stick this up.

719
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:01,070
Careful with you words, okay?

720
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,350
No… after you stick the talisman up,

721
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,830
you'll always have good luck.

722
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,430
Xiu'e,

723
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,590
I need to go to Mr. Zhu's home
to work now.

724
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,030
I have to go.

725
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,640
- I'm running late.
- Go ahead.

726
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,320
Take the talisman, and stick it up!

727
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,590
- Thanks. Need to go.
- Aiping.

728
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,830
Take care, Aiping.

729
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:23,950
What is it?

730
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,190
Come on.

731
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,690
I'll take you somewhere.

732
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,440
Where to? I still have work later.

733
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,720
It won't take long. Come on.

734
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,030
What do you mean?

735
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,750
My friend couldn't

736
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,640
pay me back,

737
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:48,590
so he gave me this piece of land
as collateral.

738
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,960
Seriously? This place?

739
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,830
He said this is just like property,
and its price

740
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:53,750
will definitely rise.

741
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,400
I don't understand business.

742
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,550
But why did you bring me here?

743
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,020
I have an idea,
but it's still not fully formed.

744
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:01,920
You help me think it over.

745
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,780
If I do this, do you think

746
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,400
Han will think better of me...

747
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,430
even just a little?

748
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,390
Go ahead.

749
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,720
Here's my idea.

750
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,920
We move Youguang's grave here.

751
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:12,830
After a hundred years,

752
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,040
you'll be here,

753
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,400
and you two will still be together.

754
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,830
I'll be there.

755
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,270
The reason I'm doing this is

756
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,690
to let Han know

757
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,480
that I've never tried to
replace his father,

758
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,110
nor have I ever wanted

759
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,920
to take his mother away.

760
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,760
Say no more.

761
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,050
If you do this,

762
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,160
not only will Han

763
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,310
not think better of you,

764
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,350
I will also be disappointed in you.

765
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,160
Don't get mad, please.

766
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,310
Okay, forget I said it.

767
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,620
Just don't be mad.

768
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,400
Your blood pressure
might go up.

769
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:48,110
Honestly, when my friend gave me this,

770
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,550
I was really pissed off.

771
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,720
It could jinx me!

772
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:53,870
Qiming,

773
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,110
I know why you want to do this,

774
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,840
and I know you means well.

775
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,960
But really, it's unnecessary.

776
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:08,430
I understand.

777
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,150
I understand.

778
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,960
Don't be mad anymore.

779
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,110
Since we're here,

780
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:17,400
let's buy some candles and incense,

781
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,920
and then visit Youguang's grave.

782
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:26,510
Have you booked a restaurant
for the birthday?

783
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,850
Let me know when you've booked it.

784
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,750
I'll "accidentally" run into you there.

785
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,030
Han said

786
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,190
he doesn't want me to eat out.

787
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,160
He'll cook at home for me.

788
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,560
Okay, okay!

789
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,560
That's fine.

790
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,790
That way.

791
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,110
Watch your step.

(New Century's Challenge)

793
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,030
New century,

794
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,240
new challenges?

795
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,160
Or...

796
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,070
things I

797
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,640
want to do but don't dare to?

798
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,550
Every piece

799
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,000
is filled with feelings.

800
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,710
Welcome to FM101.7.

801
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,190
I'm your old friend, Yangyang.

802
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,190
Thank you for joining me
at 9 PM every night.

803
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,000
Time flies, and December is here.

804
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,000
1999 is almost over,

805
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,400
and 2000 is just around the corner.

(Jiale Wontons)

807
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:44,440
(Guide to the Twelve Zodiac Signs)
When crossing midnight into the new century,

808
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,140
some say that the first person
you speak to

809
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,840
will be tied to you by a bond
lasting a century.

810
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,510
So, who would you

811
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:53,190
want to share that bond with?

812
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,280
I love summer the most.

813
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:57,340
It's the best time
to wear all kinds of skirts.

814
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:59,230
I love January and February.

815
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,440
After the New Year,
it's Brother Xiao Han's birthday,

816
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:03,630
followed by winter vacation
and the Spring Festival.

817
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,400
So many holidays to celebrate.

818
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,550

819
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,510
(12. Capricorn)

820
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:17,030
But some others claim that
December 31, 1999,

821
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:18,550
marks the end of the world.

822
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:21,230
On this day, the entire world
will be destroyed.

823
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,480
Whether it marks the end of
the century or the world,

824
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,840
it's destined to be a special December.

825
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,510
At this moment,

826
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,510
who do you think of first?

827
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:33,070
What special story

828
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,320
do you have with that person?

00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,190
Challenges

831
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:46,510
are usually things that
people always wanted to do

832
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,760
but never really did.

833
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,630
Why not challenge yourself?

834
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,800
Who knows, maybe the end of the world
really is coming.

835
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,740
Don't leave any regrets.

836
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,430
From now until the New Year,

837
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,480
I'll pick a letter each day

838
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,670
and read it to you,

839
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,320
to the person
you're thinking about right now.

840
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,840
Just join in with our
"Millennium Heartfelt Words" this month.

841
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,000
Maybe

842
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:11,070
there's a way
to kill two birds with one stone!

(A Story of a Boy and a Girl)

844
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,630
The final step

845
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,480
is to add up the stroke count

846
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,280
of your Chinese name
and the name of the person you like.

847
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,280
Then you get a final number's last digit.

848
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,570
Let me check mine.

849
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:42,590
Mine is 32,

850
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:44,480
Jeff Chang's is 26.

851
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:45,480
So, the total is…

852
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,630
58.

853
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,710
The last digit is 8.

854
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,760
What does that mean?

855
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,090
(An abnormal relationship
between a man and a woman)

856
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:53,790
An abnormal relationship
between a man and a woman!

857
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,140
Abnormal?

858
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,070
What's wrong with that?

859
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:01,000
Abnormal is the best!

860
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,510
Yuck! Yuck!

861
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,350
What about you?

862
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,320
Me?

863
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,840
Mine is zero.

864
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:06,910
Let me see.

865
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:10,620
Zero. Soulmates!

866
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,630
Who's that?

867
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:14,630
Your soulmate!

868
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,760
I'm not telling you! Stop gossiping!

869
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,670
Come on, tell us!

870
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,630
You want me to count
the strokes of all the boys

871
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,510
in our class?

872
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:22,590
Why must it be the boys in our class?

873
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,800
So, who is it?

874
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,000
Fine!

875
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,560
It's Sakuragi Hanamichi. Happy now?

876
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,760
So boring, a fictional character.

877
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,240
What about yours?

878
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,230
Four.

879
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,280
What does that mean?

880
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,120
Four?

881
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,280
Destined to meet...

882
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:41,880
Destined to meet?

883
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,800
But not to be together.

884
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,780
(Destined to meet but not to be together)

885
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,550
Not necessarily accurate!

886
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:52,670
According to this,
my relationship with Jeff is abnormal.

887
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,440
He will always be my idol.

888
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,590
How could that be abnormal?

889
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,320
If I really am soulmates

890
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,670
with Sakuragi Hanamichi,

891
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,190
what happens to Haruko?

892
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,110
Exactly!

893
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,230
That's why fate

894
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,030
has to be fought for.

895
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,480
Jiayue, fight for it.

896
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,440
I know.

897
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:09,910
Actually,

898
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,280
I wrote a story.

899
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,430
What story?

900
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,320
Is it about him?

901
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:18,670
I wanted to join the school journal,

902
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,670
so I needed to write something
on new century's challenge.

903
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,590
So, I wrote about
the story of me and him,

904
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,750
and everything I wanted to say or write

905
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,880
went into it.

906
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,110
And then he will read it?

907
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,590
Nice work!

908
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,670
I'm going to interview both of you.

909
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,010
For the new century's challenge,

910
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:35,520
what's something you want to challenge?

911
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,110
Like something you've wanted to do
but haven't,

912
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,670
or something you're too afraid to do?

913
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,080
I've got nothing I'm afraid of!

914
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,320
I'm going to cut my dad's hair!

915
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,510
But why?

916
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:50,070
We just don't get along.

917
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,190
In two years,

918
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,190
I'll definitely go to a college
far away.

919
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,440
Ka Men, what about you?

920
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,590
That person whose relationship
with me is abnormal…

921
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:03,360
he's coming to Shanghai

922
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,280
to hold a signing event
for his new album.

923
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,480
I've decided,

924
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:08,920
this time I'm definitely
getting a signed CD from him.

925
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,320
Will you two come with me?

926
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,920
Sure! Let's make it official!

927
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,710
That's our challenge for the new century!

928
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:19,200
But that sounds so unexciting.

929
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:21,800
I've always wanted to
give our group a name.

930
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,920
What name?

931
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:25,670
Something like Speed from Japan

932
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,710
or the UK's Spice Girls…

933
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:28,840
Spice Girls?

934
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,630
Who are they?

935
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:31,590
The singing group!

936
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,590
It's them, the Spice Girls.

937
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:41,440
They're the Spice Girls,

938
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:43,180
and we…

939
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:45,280
we'll be the Juice Girls!

940
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:47,760
I like grapefruit,

941
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,840
so I'll be Grapefruit Juice.

942
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,640
I like lemons,

943
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,920
so I'll be Lemon Juice.

944
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:53,630
Then I'll be Orange Juice!

945
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,030
Alright, I declare today,

946
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,840
Juice Girls is officially formed!
