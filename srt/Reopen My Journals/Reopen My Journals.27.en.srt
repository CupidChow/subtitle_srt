00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,370
Aiping, Qiming, come here.

25
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,520
Come in.

26
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:45,770
Honeysuckle and chrysanthemum.

27
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,010
Alright.

28
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,160
I like them.

29
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:49,130
Auntie,

30
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,590
how have you been these days?

31
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,000
Watermelon?

32
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,520
I bought it just for you.

33
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,090
- Careful, it's heavy.
- It's heavy.

34
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,770
It's an 8424 watermelon, right?

35
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,290
- It's ripe.
- It's ripe.

36
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,200
- Nanny,
- Definitely.

37
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,490
cut it and let's eat.

38
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,120
Alright. Boss, I'll cut it for you soon.

39
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,280
Why are you so late?

40
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,000
I've been waiting so long.

41
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,730
It's only been two days
and you miss me so much?

42
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,680
Is she your girlfriend?

43
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,370
Chairwoman Liao,

44
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,800
don't you recognize me?

45
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:21,730
Yes, I do.

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,840
I know you.

47
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,520
When are you getting married?

48
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,840
It's still too early.

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,890
No rush.

50
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:33,730
We're not in a hurry.

51
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,050
You're not, but I am.

52
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,330
I'm in a hurry.

53
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,520
Jianguo,

54
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,840
when are you getting married?

55
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,240
You should hurry up.

56
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,450
I can't wait any longer.

57
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,960
I want to attend your wedding,

58
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,800
you know?

59
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,800
Auntie,

60
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,680
who am I?

61
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,330
Jianguo.

62
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,170
Hongying.

63
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,930
Your girlfriend, right?

64
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,010
Hongying...

65
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,240
Okay.

66
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,280
Mom,

67
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,280
don't make things complicated.

68
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,720
This is Zhang Qiming,

69
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,930
Little San.

70
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,210
This is Guan Aiping,

71
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,450
the Aiping from next door.

72
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,140
- You're messing around.
- No, I'm not!

73
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,120
Jianjun didn't

74
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,960
have a banquet, did he?

75
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,240
No, there wasn't.

76
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,610
So for Jianguo's wedding,

77
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,090
why don't we have a banquet?

78
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,720
Foreign weddings don't count.

79
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,490
You must have a banquet.

80
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,930
If not, I'll beat you up.

81
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,090
Calm down.

82
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,730
We will.

83
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:27,770
We'll get married.

84
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,120
Hongying,

85
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,240
let me tell you...

86
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:35,890
She's just like this now.

87
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,120
My friend told me

88
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,560
that a specialist on Huashan Road

89
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,840
is good at treating this disease.

90
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,840
Take Auntie there.

91
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:44,610
Cut the watermelon.

92
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,170
It's brittle.

93
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,010
Take it slow.

94
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,120
Are you feeling hot?

95
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:51,490
I'll fan you.

96
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:52,650
Let me help you.

97
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,610
It's hot now.

98
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,120
There's an electric fan.

99
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:04,930
Did your mom really think

100
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,090
he's her son?

101
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,490
"My mind is very clear.

102
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,960
Don't lie to me."

103
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,920
Then she turned her head
and took Zhang Qiming's hand.

104
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,310
I'll cooperate.

105
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,520
"Jianguo,

106
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,480
when are you getting married?"

107
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,280
Mistaken him for Jianguo.

108
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,640
So, how did you explain it to her?

109
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,660
How else could we explain?

110
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,720
We just coaxed her.

111
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,050
The wontons are here.

112
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,600
Thanks, Ms. Huang.

113
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,280
Actually, my mom

114
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,330
always has a concern, right?

115
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,480
Her two sons went to America

116
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,890
and got married without inviting her.

117
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,280
When they had kids,

118
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,520
they didn't even ask her.

119
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,720
Let's not mention your brothers, okay?

120
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,600
I'm furious

121
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,920
when you talk about them.

122
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,210
How could they do that?

123
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,330
It's not all their fault.

124
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,360
America is

125
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:48,890
too far away from us.

126
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,890
Besides,

127
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,450
their conditions are not so good.

128
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,340
- Chairwoman Liao.
- Hello, everyone.

129
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,650
Hello.

130
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,320
Jianguo,

131
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,350
Hongying,

132
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,450
you're all here.

133
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,570
I was looking for you.

134
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:05,960
We're having a happy occasion.

135
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,160
Jianguo and Hongying
are getting married.

136
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,280
That's right. Congratulations to us.

137
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,520
- Congrats, congrats to Jianguo.
- Thank you.

138
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,520
Mom insisted on coming to find you.

139
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,480
She insisted on giving this to you.

140
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,490
To me?

141
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,090
Mr. Driver,

142
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,040
thank you very much.

143
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,600
You should leave.

144
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:24,600
It's hot out. I need air-conditioning.

145
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,060
Mom, what did you give me?

146
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,900
Nanny.

147
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,090
Call me Nanny.

148
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,130
You've worked

149
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,250
for a lot of people.

150
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,520
You have more connections than me.

151
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:35,920
Do you know

152
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,160
where's the best place

153
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,330
to hold a banquet in Shanghai?

154
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,570
I'll ask around.

155
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,130
If Jianguo and Hongying get married,

156
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,720
I'll pay for the banquet.

157
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,280
That's amazing!

158
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,600
This is money.

159
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:49,530
It's money.

160
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:51,970
Alright.

161
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,880
Understood, Boss.

162
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,690
So, Chen Jian...

163
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,760
No.

164
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,720
Mom gave it.

165
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,200
Chen Jianguo,

166
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,360
this is the wedding fund

167
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,890
from your mom,

168
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,920
my boss,

169
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,720
for you and Hongying.

170
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,130
Okay, I'll accept it.

171
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,160
Return it to Auntie.

172
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:10,920
- Open it.
- Open it.

173
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,890
Let me open it for you.

174
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:12,920
Count it.

175
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,760
Count it, okay.

176
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,760
See?

177
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:18,840
So much cash.

178
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,400
I've been saving it for a long time.

179
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,690
Count it now.

180
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,880
Count it.

181
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,090
I stay at home all day.

182
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,430
I don't know what's going on now.

183
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,890
I'm not sure if it's enough.

184
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:30,850
It's enough, right?

185
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:33,610
Let me count it.

186
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,600
It's plenty, more than needed.

187
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,040
I knew it was enough.

188
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,050
Jianguo,

189
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,400
so when are you and Hongying

190
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,770
going to

191
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,210
have the banquet?

192
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,360
Are we really going to have a banquet?

193
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,960
That's what I'm thinking.

194
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,920
A troubled heart needs a heartfelt cure.

195
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,330
Xiu'e also mentioned

196
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,210
that Auntie didn't attend

197
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,520
either of her sons' weddings.

198
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,650
It's the biggest regret of her life.

199
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,570
Let's host a lively banquet.

200
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,840
It might help

201
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,890
improve her health.

202
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,280
I'm not doing this for myself.

203
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,280
I can wait.

204
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,650
No problem at all.

205
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,690
I know Han is in high school.

206
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,770
And you just apprenticed under Dr. Zhan.

207
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,040
In a year, Han will be in college.

208
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,450
And you, Dr. Guan,
will finish your training in four years.

209
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,210
I can wait for all that.

210
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,010
I'm really

211
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,400
worried about her.

212
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:44,490
I'm afraid of...

213
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,240
Qiming.

214
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,050
Arrange a banquet?

215
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,160
Grandma Chen is confused.

216
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,250
You know that.

217
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,720
She's recognized Mr. Zhang

218
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,040
as her son

219
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,650
and wants him to get married.

220
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,760
So,

221
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,000
I...

222
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,920
You agreed?

223
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,760
But

224
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,360
I also want to hear your opinion.

225
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,170
Mom,

226
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,570
at first, I did oppose

227
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,050
you and Mr. Zhang being together.

228
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,120
But over time,

229
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:43,220
I've seen him do a lot for you

230
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,930
and for our family.

231
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,120
I believe he is sincere.

232
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,570
Even if it's not for Grandma Chen,

233
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,340
even if you really want to get married,

234
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,090
I'll fully support you.

235
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,170
Mom,

236
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,440
I know

237
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,450
you've suffered a lot

238
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,290
because of me.

239
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:20,880
Other classmates' parents

240
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,930
go home after work to watch TV dramas,

241
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,090
go for a walk,

242
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,690
or play cards.

243
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,420
You're the only one

244
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,530
who has to work another job after work,

245
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,570
and you don't get any rest on holidays.

246
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,600
I don't want you to be so tired.

247
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,080
Mom,

248
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,360
you've worked so hard.

249
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,400
I used to think

250
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,330
that when I grew up,

251
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,210
I could use my own ability

252
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,600
to take care of you and protect you.

253
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,880
This is also my promise to Dad.

254
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:02,880
You were so young.

255
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,760
What did you know about promises?

256
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,810
But in my heart, it was a promise.

257
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,200
Later, I realized

258
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,530
that there were many things

259
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,090
that I could not do as a son.

260
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,290
But Mr. Zhang could.

261
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,760
So apart from

262
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,120
keeping my promise to Dad,

263
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,410
of course, I hope you

264
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,720
pursue your own happiness.

265
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,090
What are you doing?
I'm not trying to be emotional.

266
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,690
No more crying.

267
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,290
Alright, go out.

268
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,130
Don't stay inside.

269
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:56,770
Aiping,

270
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,000
let's discuss something.

271
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,490
The Oriental Pearl Tower is the best.

272
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,050
Jinjiang Hotel is also good.

273
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,600
But the hall in Jinjiang Hotel

274
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,440
is too small.

275
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,360
International Hotel has a nice setting.

276
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,880
But I've asked

277
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,760
about it.

278
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,960
It'll be two months

279
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,050
before I can book it.

280
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,720
I'll call back

281
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:13,840
to confirm again,

282
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,090
and see if they can

283
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:16,570
cut us a line or something.

284
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:17,530
What do you think?

285
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,370
Qiming,

286
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,220
don't you need a marriage certificate

287
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,240
to book the banquet?

288
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:23,650
No, no need.

289
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,290
They're doing business, right?

290
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:26,930
As long as you pay for the meal,

291
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,240
they don't care.

292
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:29,840
Don't they?

293
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,880
Don't worry. It's fine.

294
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,480
Let's forget it then.

295
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,000
I was thinking

296
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,600
that if they need it,

297
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:37,960
we'll just get one.

298
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:39,370
If they don't...

299
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,840
Get one what?

300
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,240
I'm not dreaming, am I?

301
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,360
Pinch me, please.

302
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,480
Am I dreaming?

303
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,290
You're hurting me. Let go.

304
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,130
Sorry.

305
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,410
You mean,

306
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,330
"let's get married"?

307
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:54,120
Did I hear that right?

308
00:12:58,530 --> 00:12:59,720
That's great, amazing!

309
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:02,410
I've been waiting for this day for so long!

310
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:04,810
Great!

311
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,810
I've been waiting for this day for so long!

312
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,760
Put me down. Let me go.

313
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,880
- I won't.
- So many people are watching.

314
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,330
Let go.

315
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,290
Everyone is watching.

316
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,690
We're about to get our certificate.

317
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,570
What's wrong with watching, right?

318
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,680
Well,

319
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,210
feel free to look.

320
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,570
If you missed it,

321
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,170
I'll treat you to it later.

322
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,930
I'll treat you all

323
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,250
to wedding candies.

324
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,440
Aiping.

325
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,530
Aiping...

326
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,480
You have my word.

327
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:34,930
Aiping!

328
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,100
(Marriage certificate)

329
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,410
Marriage certificate.

330
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,450
The red color looks nice.

331
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:45,650
Nanny.

332
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,000
Comrade Driver.

333
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,810
Thank you, Boss.

334
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,330
My son, Chen Jianguo, gets married.

335
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:51,600
Thanks, Boss.

336
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,560
Sweetie, look,

337
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,480
Chen Jianguo gets married.

338
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,570
My photo is quite decent.

339
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,020
(Zhang Qiming)

340
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,480
Zhang Qiming, huh?

341
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,840
Isn't it Chen Jianguo?

342
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,720
Mom, I already told you.

343
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,930
Did you forget?

344
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,290
Zhang Qiming is

345
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,330
their matchmaker.

346
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,000
Put it away.

347
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,690
The matchmaker got married
at the same time as Jianguo.

348
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,100
It's double happiness.

349
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,530
Double happiness, indeed!

350
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,690
Where's the banquet being held?

351
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,100
We're hosting it at the Oriental Pearl Tower.

352
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,330
Let's spin around!

353
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,410
The Oriental Pearl Tower?

354
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,290
Zhang Qiming, you have a grand style.

355
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,930
Chen Jianguo.

356
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,480
Brother, you're really impressive.

357
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:44,980
Together, huh?

358
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,700
We'll hold it together there.

359
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,860
The Oriental Pearl Tower?

360
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,580
Don't go.

361
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:53,860
It's too expensive.

362
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,380
It's not easy for Jianguo to make money.

363
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:58,970
Yes.

364
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,620
We don't need a grand ceremony.

365
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,220
I...

366
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,620
I'll take care

367
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,020
of this wedding.

368
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,260
You don't have to worry.

369
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,220
Leave it to me.

370
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,600
Auntie, don't worry.

371
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,460
Don't worry.

372
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:11,860
I'll handle it.

373
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:12,860
Jiayue,

374
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,260
go with Grandma for a nap.

375
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,620
Let's take a nap, be good.

376
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,820
Grandma,

377
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,140
time for a nap.

378
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,620
Time to sleep?

379
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,260
Goodbye.

380
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,500
Sweetie.

381
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,860
Auntie is quite odd.

382
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,780
She only knows Jiayue,

383
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,780
not us.

384
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,740
That's right.

385
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,140
I'm

386
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,230
her son's nanny.

387
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,340
And Qian Kang

388
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,460
is her son's driver.

389
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,020
Now she only knows Jiayue

390
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,660
and you.

391
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,740
Stop it.

392
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,580
Who am I?

393
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,220
I'm Jianguo.

394
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,270
Jiayue was raised

395
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,140
by her since childhood.

396
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,380
They're very close.

397
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,860
Xiu'e,

398
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,620
don't take it personally.

399
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,860
She loves Jiayue as much
as she loves you.

400
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,260
Yes,

401
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,780
I won't overthink it.

402
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,460
I won't hold it against her.

403
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:14,970
Every day,

404
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,820
I just hope she can call me Nanny

405
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,860
a few more times.

406
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,100
Let's not talk about this.

407
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,340
Aiping,

408
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,820
you've got the marriage certificate.

409
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,220
Are you moving

410
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,620
to Jinxiu Garden?

411
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,540
On the weekend.

412
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,920
We'll move on the weekend.

413
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,460
So soon?

414
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,860
This weekend?

415
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,700
We'll lose another neighbor.

416
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,940
Stop it.

417
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,340
It's not the end of the world.

418
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,540
Jinxiu Garden is just a short walk away.

419
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,700
It's different.

420
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,860
It feels like it's across the street.

421
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,500
I have a feeling

422
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,620
that our lives are about to move on.

423
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:32,580
(Jinxiu Garden)

424
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,660
Mom,

425
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,860
did you notice before

426
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,500
there's a line underneath this?

427
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,590
Famous entrepreneur.

428
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,940
(Famous Entrepreneur, Zhang Qiming)

429
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,870
I saw it a while ago.

430
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,740
Right?

431
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,140
You noticed it too, right?

432
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,420
I'm telling you,

433
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,060
this line wasn't originally there,

434
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,340
but he paid someone to add it.

435
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,840
So, look at this big face and these big eyes.

436
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,340
Every time I walk in, he looks at me,

437
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,660
and my pressure comes up.

438
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,420
Now that you've moved in,

439
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,740
I have the courage to take it off.

440
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,820
Shall we replace it?

441
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,540
Little imp,

442
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,780
I heard what you said.

443
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,360
You really need to be taught a lesson.

444
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,460
What's up?

445
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,060
No need to see the photo.

446
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,370
You'll see the real one daily.

447
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,720
Han,

448
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,580
let's go.

449
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,540
I'll show you your room.

450
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,940
Zhang Qiming,

451
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,740
did you promise me three wishes?

452
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,100
Yes, I'm a man of my word.

453
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,820
If you wish for it, I'll do my best.

454
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,580
I'll tell you my first wish now.

455
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,420
From now on,

456
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,900
don't be so harsh on Mao Tou.

457
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,780
I'm granting you big wishes,

458
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,980
such as adding you and Han
to the real estate license

459
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,980
and handing over the bank card to you.

460
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,340
Such trivial stuff...

461
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,260
Do you agree?

462
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,660
You're lucky.

463
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,340
You're so lucky.

464
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,340
Also,

465
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,580
you don't have to be so cautious with Han.

466
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,740
Yes, Mr. Zhang.

467
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,330
From now on, you treat me the way

468
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,540
you treat Mao Tou.

469
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,740
Got it.

470
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,860
I will control

471
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,620
and relax.

472
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,380
Understood.

473
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,420
I took this photo
at Wang Kai Photo Studio.

474
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,540
When it was done,

475
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,820
the boss insisted on keeping it

476
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,860
as a model.

477
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,780
He said he wanted to show everyone

478
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,860
in Shanghai

479
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,180
the image

480
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,620
of local entrepreneurs.

481
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,860
It's not about the photo studio.

482
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,140
Photos of entrepreneurs

483
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,230
just don't fit in the house.

484
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,260
- Little...
- Agreed.

485
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:37,860
Agreed too.

486
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,420
Three votes.

487
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,500
Switch.

488
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,100
Let's switch it.

489
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:52,900
Han,

490
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,450
let's see your room.

491
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,730
Come on, let's go.

492
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,340
Watch the steps. Slow down.

493
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,720
(Famous Entrepreneur, Zhang Qiming)

494
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,620
Come on.

495
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,140
The day before yesterday,

496
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,300
he went with me to the furniture store.

497
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,560
What do you think? It's American style,

498
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,340
sleek, minimalist, with a chic gray.

499
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,820
What do you think?

500
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,260
Do you like it?

501
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,100
If you like it, it's my credit.

502
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,220
If not,

503
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,020
this idea came from him.

504
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,820
He has bad taste.

505
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,800
I picked out

506
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,740
all the bedding for you.

507
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,420
Come on, take a look.

508
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,940
Mr. Zhang,

509
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,300
you don't have to buy a computer.

510
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,660
I'll just use one

511
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,820
with Mao Tou when I need it.

512
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,180
Han, I promise you.

513
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,900
In the future, whatever Mao Tou has,

514
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,020
you must have it too.

515
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,340
Mao Tou, what Han has,

516
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,400
you don't necessarily have.

517
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,500
What's going on?

518
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,700
Here we go again.

519
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,300
We've agreed to treat them equally.

520
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,780
Mao Tou, don't listen to him.

521
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:51,940
In the future,

522
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,140
we might have things he won't.

523
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,180
We'll isolate you.

524
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,140
Alright.

525
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,500
I'm the fourth in the family.

526
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,180
By the way, Aiping,

527
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,780
let's check the kitchen and bathroom

528
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,180
to see what else needs to be

529
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,620
adjusted or added.

530
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,780
You can do it at any time. Come here.

531
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,620
I'll go and help you on Sunday.

532
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,740
- Okay.
- Come here.

533
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,100
Have a seat.

534
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,180
Let me tell you,

535
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,900
I've got a lot of games for you.

536
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:27,380
(Puyang New Village)

537
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,300
Brother Xiao Han,

538
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,380
I've put these shoes in the box for you.

539
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,860
Alright, leave them there.

540
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,860
Do you need more help?

541
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,700
Really?

542
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,020
Thanks a lot!

543
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,860
Brother, you're still the best
at what you do.

544
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,180
Thanks a lot!

545
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:43,820
Aiping,

546
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,060
the Revolving Restaurant is set.

547
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,140
Let's get

548
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,140
revolving.

549
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,090
I'll check on the cigarettes and drinks.

550
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:50,890
And the invitations.

551
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,860
I'll handle that.

552
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,420
Basketball.

553
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,740
Pack this up.

554
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,220
Mom,

555
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,580
I'll tidy up the living room.

556
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,460
Okay.

557
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,540
Mom,

558
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,140
should we take Dad's things

559
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,500
with us too?

560
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,980
This house won't change,

561
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,140
so leave them here.

562
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,500
Look at that.

563
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,260
Ka Men's store is right there.

564
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,080
Yes,

565
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:47,940
it's on that street.

566
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:48,980
Do you remember

567
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,580
you once said near there,

568
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,900
"Near the ink, you're black"?

569
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,880
But the first part is
"Near the vermilion, you're red".

570
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,100
Behind that building is our school.

571
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,060
I've seen that building from school too.

572
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:09,980
Welcome,

573
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,460
new neighbor.

574
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,580
Hello, new neighbor.

575
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,660
Hello?

576
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,700
Qiming.

577
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:34,980
Right?

578
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,580
Close the door.

579
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,420
Close it.

580
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,220
Sweetie.

581
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,660
Can you do me a favor?

582
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,340
Go pick out

583
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,260
the biggest and heaviest set

584
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,340
of yellow jewelry.

585
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,100
Grandma, you hide the key too?

586
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,340
There won't be
straw paper inside, right?

587
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,140
How could it be straw paper?

588
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:08,900
Look.

589
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,140
There's a lot of money inside.

590
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,140
The password is your birthday.

591
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,580
My birthday?

592
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,540
You take this

593
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,620
and go pick out the biggest
and heaviest set.

594
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,420
It doesn't matter if you use up

595
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,300
all the money inside.

596
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,260
I still have money.

597
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,980
Don't doubt that.

598
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,300
I've even prepared your dowry.

599
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,420
The dowry?

600
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,420
Of course.

601
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,380
Men and women have to get married

602
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,180
when they grow up.

603
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,140
Sooner or later,

604
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,540
you'll have to get married.

605
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,380
But

606
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,420
you can't talk to the nanny outside

607
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,580
about getting money for shopping.

608
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,340
She's not reliable.

609
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,420
Got it?

610
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,860
Especially not the password.

611
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,060
The password is your birthday.

612
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,580
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

613
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,100
Alright.

614
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,300
I get it, okay.

615
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,980
If it can't be changed, so be it.

616
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,100
I'm hanging up.

617
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,700
Baby.

618
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,860
So mysterious.

619
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,020
What did she ask you to do?

620
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,540
Grandma gave me a bank card.

621
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,500
She asked me to buy the biggest

622
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,860
and heaviest set

623
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,300
of yellow jewelry.

624
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:27,550
Mom,

625
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,920
what exactly is yellow jewelry?

626
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,580
It's gold.

627
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,900
She may be forgetful,

628
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,890
but she's very generous
to her daughter-in-law.

629
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,060
How much money is in it?

630
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,820
Grandma said it's a lot.

631
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,220
She also said the password

632
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,340
for this card is my birthday.

633
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,540
Baby, here.

634
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,740
Let me keep the card.

635
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,860
I'll buy it later, okay?

636
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,700
Okay.

637
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,820
Baby,

638
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,340
I have one more thing to tell you.

639
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,100
It's about your Auntie Aiping's wedding.

640
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,540
It's scheduled

641
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,540
on the day of your birthday.

642
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,820
They booked it in a hurry,

643
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,820
so they didn't have any other date.

644
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,500
So...

645
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,580
It's okay.

646
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,260
It's not a big date anyway.

647
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,500
I didn't plan to celebrate.

648
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,380
I mean

649
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,900
there will be a lot of people

650
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,180
that day.

651
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,540
Over 20 tables.

652
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,540
A lot of adults and kids

653
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,340
will be there,

654
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,540
so we'll meet a lot of people.

655
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:31,700
Baby,

656
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,820
I'll give you money.

657
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,820
How about you
treat your classmates to a meal

658
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,300
and you all

659
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,540
have a lively birthday?

660
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,100
It's okay, Mom.

661
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,340
I'll go.

662
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,100
Alright, okay.

663
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,820
Zhang Qiming made a big move this time.

664
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,860
He even reserved the whole venue.

665
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,300
After so many years,
they finally get married.

666
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,820
Of course, they want to show off.

667
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,100
Mom,

668
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,340
have Mr. Zhang and Mrs. Xiao

669
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,620
set their wedding date?

670
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,560
Yes, they have.

671
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,420
This Sunday.

672
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,100
But it's Qian Jiayue's birthday.

673
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,660
Really?

674
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:21,820
Yeah.

675
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,020
I'm buying her a present

676
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,180
in Xidian Mall this afternoon.

677
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:33,420
(Xidian Mall, Tian's Gift Shop)

678
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,260
Hello, Boss.

679
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,280
Hello.

680
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,780
I'd like to buy a gift.

681
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,620
Let's take a look inside.

682
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,740
Is it for a boy or a girl?

683
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:41,820
For a girl.

684
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,660
A girl?

685
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,140
Take a look here.

686
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:46,740
Who is she to you?

687
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,620
Let me recommend it.

688
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,660
Someone

689
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,740
special.

690
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,340
Is it a birthday gift or...?

691
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,340
Not a birthday gift.

692
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:55,820
It's the kind of gift

693
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,420
that says

694
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,660
"You mean a lot to me".

695
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,580
Do you know what she likes?

696
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,220
She likes

697
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,700
to eat.

698
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,140
That's easy.

699
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,220
Over here.

700
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,660
Look, this is my shop too.

701
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,780
Come and have a look.

702
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,780
Give her some chocolates.

703
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,100
Girls love them.

704
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,260
This is the perfect one.

705
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,580
Check out these new arrivals.

706
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,900
You can even match the gift box.

707
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:27,980
Pick it out yourself.

708
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,420
It shows your sincerity.

709
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:31,200
- They're all good.
- Okay.

710
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,180
I'll take my pick.

711
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,660
I want that one.

712
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:35,660
- Which one?
- That one.

713
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:36,700
The heart-shaped one,

714
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:37,940
the pink one.

715
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,100
That's the one, right?

716
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,180
Yes.

717
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,220
This looks nice.

718
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,340
Girls would love it.

719
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,180
Alright.

720
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,500
Take your pick.

721
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,060
Anything here, right?

722
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:47,910
Yes.

723
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,860
White chocolate,

724
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,700
dark chocolate,

725
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,620
and this filled one

726
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,260
sell exceptionally well.

727
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,940
(Shanghai Puyang No. 2 Middle School)

728
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,500
Ka Men, can I borrow a pen?

729
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,580
Just a moment.

730
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,020
This blue one.

731
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,180
It writes beautifully.

732
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,180
Thanks.

733
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,620
Thank you.

734
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,820
Bye.

735
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,420
Lu Yao?

736
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,420
Rui,

737
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,100
I heard from my mom

738
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,130
that your family is going abroad.

739
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,620
Yeah,

740
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,840
I've been here for a few days.

741
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,190
I haven't had a chance to tell you.

742
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:35,260
You know my uncle lives in Australia.

743
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,740
I'm planning
to pursue a master's degree.

744
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,100
How long is it?

745
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,120
Two years.

746
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,380
So you'll be back in two years?

747
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,220
I'm not sure.

748
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,780
I might go for a PhD,

749
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,860
or I might find a job there.

750
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,780
There's also a chance I'll return.

751
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,220
What's up?

752
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,180
I got you a gift.

753
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:55,860
Here,

754
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,020
this is for you.

755
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,420
Open it.

756
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,580
I picked these

757
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,500
one by one.

758
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,100
It represents my feelings.

759
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:08,140
(Special gift for special one)

760
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,140
Thank you.

761
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,820
But I really can't accept this.

762
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:23,980
Please take it back.

763
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,500
This...

764
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,620
Take it back.

765
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,100
Go home quickly.

766
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,300
What are you standing here?

767
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,420
But...

768
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,950
But Senior Xue is...

769
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,040
You...

770
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:28,740
You knew her before?

771
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,260
We grew up together.

772
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,260
She was my neighbor.

773
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,140
As far back as I remember,

774
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,020
she's been

775
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,780
gentle

776
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,260
and pretty.

777
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,900
She played with

778
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,300
a few kids from my building.

779
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:48,410
She...

780
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,920
She let me play rubber band skipping

781
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,460
with her

782
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,820
and taught us to recognize words.

783
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,100
Whenever we were mischievous,

784
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,380
she never got angry.

785
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,140
She was always smiling

786
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:00,820
and happy.

787
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,340
I used to stutter when I was little,

788
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,000
so she encouraged me
to try out as a little host.

789
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,080
Have you heard of Little Star?

790
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,780
I still remember

791
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,180
that she gave me a tie

792
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,660
when I first appeared

793
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,980
on stage as a host.

794
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,260
I still keep it to this day.

795
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:21,100
I'm tonight's host, Liu Wanqing.

796
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,420
(Happy Reunion, Happy New Year)
I'm tonight's host, Lu Yao.

797
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:24,500
Lu Yao,

798
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,740
1990 is about to arrive.

799
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,420
Do you have any New Year wishes?

800
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,580
I wish for long-lasting friendships

801
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:34,100
with my classmates and friends.

802
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,180
Later, she went to college.

803
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,340
Her family moved away too.

804
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,540
I haven't seen her

805
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,860
for two years and three months.

806
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:53,500
When she came back

807
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,140
to our school for exchanges,

808
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,300
it was like a switch

809
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,660
was flipped.

810
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,780
Every day, I was so happy.

811
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,820
I looked forward

812
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,500
to seeing her at school every day.

813
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,420
However,

814
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,220
she was going abroad

815
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,860
after the exchange.

816
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,460
It's very likely

817
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,860
that we'll never meet again.

818
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:29,900
I gave her chocolates,

819
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,940
but they were returned. Tell me,

820
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,840
am I being ridiculous?

821
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:37,940
No, you're not.

822
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,620
Not at all.

823
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,460
I've thought long and hard.

824
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,860
The only thing I can do

825
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:56,500
is to give her a farewell gift.

826
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,900
At least it shows my feelings.

827
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:14,980
Maybe...

828
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,100
Maybe I can help you.

829
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:34,270
Liu Wanqing.

830
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,540
Senior Xue.

831
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,860
What do you want to see me?

832
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,780
I heard you're going abroad.

833
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:46,220
Yes.

834
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,180
I'm leaving right after this exchange.

835
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,740
I'm especially happy to be back

836
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,940
at No. 2 Middle School

837
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,660
for the exchange and to meet you all.

838
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,500
But it's almost senior year.

839
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,060
You have to work hard.

840
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,540
Senior Xue,

841
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,860
you're so gentle.

842
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,580
You're very nice too.

843
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,540
You know I'm leaving,

844
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,570
so you came to see me off.

845
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,100
Thank you.

846
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,940
Anything else?

847
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,620
I heard from Lu Yao
that you're neighbors.

848
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,140
Yes, we are.

849
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,640
That's right.

850
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:28,260
You're in the same class, right?

851
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:31,900
Actually,

852
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,100
I'm here to deliver something

853
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:34,940
for Lu Yao.

854
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,100
I already told him I don't need it.

855
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,260
But it's a farewell gift

856
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,060
Lu Yao had picked out

857
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:49,900
with care.

858
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,100
The chocolates in here

859
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,380
were handpicked by him one by one.

860
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,620
He...

861
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,420
If you don't accept it,

862
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,570
he'll be very sad and upset.

863
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,260
Senior Xue, please accept it.

864
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,900
Then thank Lu Yao for me.

865
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:10,940
She really took it?

866
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:12,940
She did.

867
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,100
What did she say?

868
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,100
She...

869
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,140
She said

870
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,220
thank you,

871
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,780
that she appreciated your thoughts,

872
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,140
and that she felt happy.

873
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:26,280
What else did she say?

874
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:28,420
Anything else?

875
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,370
She said

876
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,660
she's always missed

877
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,310
playing with you bunch of kids

878
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,660
back in the day.

879
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:45,940
Thank you,

880
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:46,900
Ka Men.

881
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,980
But I'm a little late today.

882
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,460
I have a show to record later.

883
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:52,820
Some other time.

884
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,300
I'll treat you to a meal.

885
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,140
Sure.

886
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,580
I'll head off now.

887
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,840
Thank you.

888
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:02,820
Bye-bye.

889
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,420
Bye.

890
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,100
Then thank Lu Yao for me.

891
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,380
But I really can't accept this gift.

892
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,220
I don't want
to cause any misunderstanding.

893
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,100
There are some things

894
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,500
you'll understand when you grow up.

895
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:31,940
How about this?

896
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,500
Tell him

897
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,100
that even if we rarely meet,

898
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,380
I'll always remember him

899
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,260
and the days

900
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,620
when I used to spend time

901
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,900
with those kids.

902
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,340
I'm leaving.

903
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,300

to actually win over Guan Aiping.

919
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,260
He was so happy.

920
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,860
He must tell the whole world.

921
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:16,900
Are you talking about

922
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,230
Zhang Qiming and Guan Aiping?

923
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,140
When do you think they got together?

924
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:21,460
Wasn't it

925
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,620
when Zhang Qiming became rich?

926
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,780
Exactly.

927
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,460
In the past, Guan Aiping

928
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,940
didn't even look at Zhang Qiming.

929
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,740
She only paid attention

930
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:31,980
to college students

931
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:33,420
or model workers.

932
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:36,260
Nowadays, times have changed.

933
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,100
It's better

934
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,740
to find a rich person.

935
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,380
That's why I say

936
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,620
that so worthy of her,

937
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,100
either looking for money

938
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,580
or looking for talent.

939
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,780
You see, she's always a winner.

940
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,260
She's got a good eye

941
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:51,940
and made decisive moves.

942
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,580
I've heard people say

943
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,500
that they've...

944
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,380
Mr. Zhang, congratulations!

945
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,660
Thank you.

946
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:13,220

947
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:16,540
