Listen, I just got

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,300
(Taxi)
a wonderful deal.

26
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,240
Heading to Pudong.

27
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,230
Congratulations.

28
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,400
- You...
- Li,

29
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,400
here's the thing.

30
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,840
Could you give me more shifts
during the Chinese New Year?

31
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,710
Well, I'll visit relatives

32
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,680
during the day.

33
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,480
Can you arrange more night shifts?

34
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,920
Qian Kang, aren't you from Jiangxi?

35
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,240
Well,

36
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,330
aren't you going home?

37
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,430
Well, Qian Kang is

38
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,270
a live-in son-in-law.

39
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,120
He won't go back.

40
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,040
Didn't you know that?

41
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,430
What do you mean?

42
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,790
Tell me the details.

43
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,030
Tell me more about it.

44
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,710
Thanks, Li.

45
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,560
Start from the 2nd day
of Chinese New Year.

46
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,680
You must be careful.

47
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,080
Mao Tou!

48
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,560
Hold it tight!

49
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,840
- What?
- It's just a computer.

50
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,630
I can make a couple of rounds.

51
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,840
Why did you call him over?

52
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,960
You don't understand.

53
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,590
He's a technical consultant.

54
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,870
It's different, okay?

55
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,520
This way?

56
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,560
Yes, this door here.

57
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,750
Technical consultant.

58
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,080
Mao Tou, be careful.

59
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,990
The monitor needs to be upright.

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,840
Mao Tou.

61
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,430
Set the monitor upright.

62
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,240
Be careful.

63
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,080
Oh, close the curtains.

64
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,240
Mao Tou, close the curtains.

65
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,870
Then...

66
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,120
What's this?

67
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,960
It's a mess.

68
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,750
Now put this

69
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,590
on top of it.

70
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,000
It worked!

71
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,150
It's really moving!

72
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,920
Thank you, Chang Wuji.

73
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,840
It's okay. You're welcome.

74
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,190
Brother Xiao Han has loved watching

75
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,630
the stars since childhood.

76
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,840
Now, he's the president
of the Astronomy Club.

77
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,050
Mao Tou,

78
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,080
do you think

79
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,910
Brother Xiao Han will like this gift?

80
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,150
He definitely will.

81
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,590
Be gentle.

82
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,360
Hello.

83
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,310
Hello.

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,430
- Qian Lin?
- Brother, is that you?

85
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,910
Well, hang up first.

86
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,520
I... I'll call you in a minute.

87
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,750
I'll go into the room.

88
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,000
Qian Lin.

89
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,120
We can talk now.

90
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,270
Brother,

91
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,920
are you really not coming back?

92
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,070
You have no idea.

93
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,430
Mom cried again about it this morning.

94
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,720
Tell her not to cry, okay?

95
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,480
You know

96
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,510
the situation here, right?

97
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,720
My mother-in-law isn't well.

98
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,670
How about this?

99
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,600
I'll bring Jiayue

100
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,190
to visit you in summer, alright?

101
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,670
By the way,

102
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,360
did you receive the money and gifts?

103
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,160
Have a good Chinese New Year.

104
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,230
As

105
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,270
your younger brother,

106
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,240
it's not my place to say this.

107
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,080
However,

108
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,390
you've really spoiled your wife.

109
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,640
Honestly,

110
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,720
you have no idea
what the villagers said.

111
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,160
They said you went to Shanghai
to be a live-in son-in-law.

112
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,040
You drink her footbath water every day,

113
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,740
and your daughter doesn't have
our surname.

114
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,630
They said our family

115
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,430
sold sons to make a living.

116
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,920
What nonsense is this?

117
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,630
These gossipers always spread rumors

118
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,720
in the village,

119
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,740
you can't stop them.

120
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,160
Just let them talk.

121
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,510
Tell Mom to ignore them.

122
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,800
Hello, Qian Lin,

123
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,010
I'm Xiu'e.

124
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,240
Oh, Xiu'e.

125
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,160
Hello, hello.

126
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,720
- Tell Dad and Mom
- Hello.

127
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,750
our whole family is going back

128
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,160
to Jiangxi this time.

129
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,720
- It's a deal, okay?
- Okay.

130
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,560
I'm hanging up.

131
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,880
Xiu'e...

132
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,000
What are you doing?

133
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,990
Stop!

134
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,160
I'm back.

135
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,800
What are you doing?

136
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,830
Your mom is the best wife ever.

137
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,670
Jiayue.

138
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,040
I'll tell her, okay?

139
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,230
This year,

140
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,830
we're going back to Jiangxi.

141
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:29,720
Thank you.

142
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,040
See you on the 6th day.

143
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,390
I hope Mom can book the return tickets
on the 5th day.

144
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,390
If I can't make it back by the 6th day,

145
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,720
I'll cry my eyes out.

146
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,190
It's okay.

147
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,870
If you can't make it back,

148
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:06,890
just don't come back.

149
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,390
It's not a big deal.

150
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,360
Mao Tou!

151
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,400
Sister Jiayue.

152
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,310
Will you call me

153
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,870
after going back to Jiangxi?

154
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,440
Of course.

155
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:21,680
What's my home number?

156
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,860
During the Chinese New Year,

157
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,480
you'll visit Brother Xiao Han anyway.

158
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,480
I'll call Brother Xiao Han,

159
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,950
and you can answer it.

160
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's different.

161
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,000
Brother Xiao Han

162
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,840
is not me.

163
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,310
I can't follow him around every day.

164
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,670
Aren't you already?

165
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,920
Here's my number.

166
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,390
Please remember it.

167
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,720
Call me, okay?

168
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,480
If you can't make it back,

169
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,560
I'll show

170
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,510
Brother Xiao Han

171
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,750
the gift you prepared.

172
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,600
After all, it's from your heart.

173
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,920
Dad, why did you come in?

174
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,000
What are you doing?

175
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,550
Why are you up this late?

176
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,390
What are you doing?

177
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,390
What are you here at this hour?

178
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,150
Listen carefully, don't think

179
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,930
you can slack off

180
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,200
just because it's vacation.

181
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,440
If you

182
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,720
score last in the final exams

183
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,150
in the next semester,

184
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,160
I'll...

185
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,440
Got it.

186
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,000
It's late. Can you stop scolding me?

187
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,910
Well,

188
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,080
on the 3rd day,

189
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,550
we'll visit Uncle Wang.

190
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,360
On the 4th day, we'll visit my aunt.

191
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,240
How about the 6th Day?

192
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,550
On the 6th day...

193
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,750
No plans yet.

194
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,720
Good then.

195
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,560
What's wrong?

196
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,960
Nothing.

197
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,440
Go to sleep.

198
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,870
Jiayue, do you remember this place?

199
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:39,710
Sister-in-law!

200
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,110
Brother!

201
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,510
Brother, you're back!

202
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,840
Where are Mom and Dad?

203
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:44,870
Inside the house.

204
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,080
Qian Lin!

205
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,510
Brother is back!

206
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,960
Let me help you.

207
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,120
Help Xiu'e.

208
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,630
- Let me help you.
- No need!

209
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,670
- Give it to me.
- Dad, Mom!

210
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,670
- This is your uncle.
- Hello, Uncle.

211
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,640
Jiayue has grown so tall.

212
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,440
Brother!

213
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,800
Qian Yu!

214
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,630
You've grown so tall!

215
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,360
Last time, you were a little kid.

216
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,560
Dad!

217
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,080
Mom!

218
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,230
Dad!

219
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,600
We're back to visit you.

220
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,510
Grandpa and Grandma.

221
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,750
Hello, Grandpa, Grandma.

222
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,440
Dad, Mom.

223
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,350
Xiu'e.

224
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,420
Why are you standing there?

225
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,720
Give the gifts to my parents

226
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,030
and brothers.

227
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,750
Mom, Dad,

228
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,480
we've prepared
health supplements for you.

229
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,630
Thank you.

230
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,480
Brother.

231
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,010
- This is for you.
- Xiu'e!

232
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,080
A wool blanket.

233
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,240
- Xiu'e!
- Thank you, Xiu'e!

234
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,080
And Weihao's gift.

235
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,480
Where's Hao? Where's my nephew?

236
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,360
Hao.

237
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,270
- Hao, come here.
- Hao, good boy.

238
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,240
Say hello.

239
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,080
Hao, come on.

240
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,120
Say hello.

241
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,120
Uncle, Aunt.

242
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,080
Hao.

243
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,240
Here's your gift.

244
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,440
Electronic Dictionary.

245
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,840
Awesome!
Does it have video games?

246
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,800
Sure.

247
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:53,750
Weiye, Here.

248
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,630
- You're too kind.
- Want Want Gift Pack.

249
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,440
Thank you.

250
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,600
So many snacks.

251
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,590
Where's Jiali?

252
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,600
She's in the kitchen.

253
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,630
Does she have a gift?

254
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,200
Jiayue, go to the kitchen
to play with your cousin.

255
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,160
Okay.

256
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,030
- She's inside.
- In the kitchen.

257
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,240
This is so great.

258
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,090
Jiali,

259
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,200
here's the new backpack
my parents got for you.

260
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,680
Thank you.

261
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,240
Why are you cooking alone here?

262
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,910
You're our guests from the city.

263
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,790
A countryside girl like me

264
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,080
can only cook for you.

265
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,590
Come on.

266
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,150
Dad, let's have a drink.

267
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,510
Have a drink.

268
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,320
- Brother.
- Qian Yu, Qian Lin, thanks.

269
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,390
Need anything else?

270
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,910
Sister-in-law, make it spicier.

271
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,150
You haven't changed.

272
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,160
Can't find it in Shanghai.

273
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,280
Come on.

274
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,440
Sit down and eat.

275
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,350
Jiayue,

276
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,870
I heard you got into a key high school.

277
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,040
Your mom said

278
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,670
now that you're
in this high school,

279
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,320
you're already halfway

280
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,000
to a prestigious university.

281
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,630
Their College Entrance Exam.

282
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,030
Huh.

283
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,360
Why are you saying?

284
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,240
What's wrong with it?

285
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,890
How many local spots
for top universities do you have?

286
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,080
How many seats are left
for other provinces?

287
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,960
Aren't you aware of

288
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,440
your own level?

289
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,150
We all study hard

290
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,270
to get into a university.

291
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,030
How is my level not good enough?

292
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,960
Don't you think
that's really unfair to me?

293
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,080
That's how it is.

294
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,440
Why are you so proud?

295
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,060
Let's see if you can solve

296
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,240
a Grade 10 question here.

297
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,230
Jiali.

298
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:46,910
Are you out of your mind?

299
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,550
Just eat your meal.

300
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,270
You're a girl.

301
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,360
How ridiculous.

302
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,800
Mom.

303
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,960
It's okay.

304
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,390
Jiayue, just eat.

305
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,470
This one.

306
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,910
A random question from our workbook.

307
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,800
Jiali.

308
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,080
What are you doing?

309
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,270
We don't get tested on this.

310
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,380
You don't get tested on

311
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,600
any difficult questions, right?

312
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,360
Aren't you from a key high school?

313
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,510
We're having dinner.

314
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,550
Don't talk about studying, okay?

315
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,630
That's right.

316
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,390
There are more claws.

317
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,270
I'll get some.

318
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,240
Thank you.

319
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,440
Yes.

320
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,440
We don't get tested on that.

321
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,240
We focus on students' abilities.

322
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,440
Do you understand?

323
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,560
No mindless memorization
and endless practice.

324
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,360
We test a person's ability.

325
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,550
Sounds nice in theory.

326
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,080
Fine, I'll also ask you a question.

327
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,600
A bear fell into a well.

328
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,240
The well is 19.617 meters deep.

329
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,440
The bear landed after two seconds.

330
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,440
So, what color is the bear?

331
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,550
That's not a physics question.

332
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,200
It's a riddle.

333
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,360
This is a physics problem.

334
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,630
It's on our physics exam.

335
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,600
Analyze its gravitational acceleration

336
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,440
to determine the latitude
and identify it as a black bear.

337
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,590
This question

338
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,120
covers physics, geography, and biology.

339
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,600
This is well-rounded education.

340
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,660
We test comprehensive ability.

341
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,920
Then you...

342
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,080
Jiayue.

343
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,630
That was impressive.

344
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,630
Don't argue with her.

345
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,600
Jiali, Jiayue is our guest.

346
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,240
Watch your mouth, okay?

347
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,440
Eat dinner.

348
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,230
Xiu'e.

349
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,240
Come on, try this.

350
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,440
I'm full. I'm full.

351
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,360
Thank you.

352
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,200
Jiayue.

353
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,580
(Yingmo Community)

354
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,630
Mao Tou.

355
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,750
Are you there?

356
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,920
Coming.

357
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,910
God Grandma, why are you here?

358
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,750
Mao Tou, what are you doing?

359
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:05,750
I...

360
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,270
I'm fixing the computer.

361
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,080
The mailman delivered a letter.

362
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,360
- I brought it here.
- Okay.

363
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,200
It's for your dad.

364
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,210
From Japan.

365
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,160
Don't forget to give it to him.

366
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,900
(Yang Min)

367
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,080
Pack things up.

368
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,040
Why?

369
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,350
Your mom...

370
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,400
Yang Min

371
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,510
is coming back.

372
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,000
Yang Min wrote a letter.

373
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,970
(Yang Min)

374
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:18,990
I wanted to get a divorce,

375
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,960
and she agreed.

376
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,320
She'll be in Shanghai soon.

377
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,360
Aiping, don't worry.

378
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,670
I'll end this marriage

379
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,150
quickly and completely.

380
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,550
I'll be free again.

381
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,590
Then we can

382
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,680
grow old together.

383
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,120
I thought they divorced long ago.

384
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,240
Dad said she betrayed us.

385
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,600
He wanted to trap her.

386
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,910
If she dares to get married in Japan,

387
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,120
she'll commit bigamy.

388
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,870
Divorce.

389
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,910
Back then, she was entangled

390
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,550
with an old man in Japan.

391
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,550
I was so pissed off.

392
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,790
She wanted a divorce. No way.

393
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,790
How could I divorce her?

394
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,720
Now I want to divorce her.

395
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:55,960
I'll negotiate with her,

396
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,550
and I need a strategy.

397
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,510
I've figured it out.

398
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,200
This time, Mao Tou and I

399
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,360
will put on a show for her.

400
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,190
A show?

401
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:06,400
What kind of show?

402
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:07,870
Take a guess.

403
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,830
We'll pack up,

404
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,000
and move back

405
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,240
to the old house.

406
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,240
Why?

407
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,070
You know Yang Min, right?

408
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,400
She's ruthless.

409
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,200
We're not divorced yet,

410
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,000
if she knew I've made a fortune.

411
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,240
She'll make a scene

412
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,270
and share my properties.

413
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:27,110
All the money I've earned

414
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,160
has nothing to do with her.

415
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,030
Why should I share it?

416
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,830
I'll pretend to be poor

417
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:32,670
and sick.

418
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,310
I told her,

419
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,070
"I didn't want to divorce you.

420
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,540
Now that I'm unemployed

421
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,240
and sick, I can divorce you.

422
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,400
You only need

423
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,400
to give me some money."

424
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,110
She agreed in the letter.

425
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,560
Qiming.

426
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,340
It's not right to deceive her like this.

427
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,750
I think you two should

428
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,070
have an honest talk

429
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,550
and end it peacefully.

430
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,160
If she's really struggling,

431
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,670
why can't you give her some money?

432
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,030
After all,

433
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,240
she's Mao Tou's mother.

434
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,920
Yes! I said, "You're useless!"

435
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,760
I'm useless?

436
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,830
I said, "You're useless, loser!"

437
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,510
What about you?
You wander around every day!

438
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,160
Who wanders around? It's you!

439
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,400
You're always gambling!

440
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,310
How dare you judge me?

441
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,400
I like it, so what?

442
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,440
None of your business!

443
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,590
Then stay out of my business!

444
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,880
Why do you care? Shut up!

445
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,110
Who cares? Aren't you ashamed?

446
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,750
- Aren't you a mother?
- What's wrong?

447
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,070
I'm way better than you, okay?

448
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,200
Who else do you dare to yell at
except for me?

449
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,310
Little imp, stop crying!

450
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,000
Zhang Qiming, don't yell at my son!

451
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,510
You don't deserve to be his mom!

452
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,000
I can even raise a digital pet.

453
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,920
What digital pet?

454
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,270
Stop bragging.

455
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,240
How can you raise a pet?

456
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,160
Come tomorrow

457
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,480
and see for yourself.

458
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,310
When the three of us go out,

459
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,790
people will know we're from the south.

460
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,160
Dad and Mom have been
in Jiangxi for many years

461
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,560
and still have a northern accent.

462
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,830
We're from Hebei.

463
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,550
It's hard to change our accent.

464
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,160
Come on, cheers.

465
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,240
Hard to change. Well said.

466
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,950
Qian Kang.

467
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,390
Don't drink too much.

468
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:30,920
Xiu'e.

469
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,160
It's rare for us

470
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,750
to have fun with our brother.

471
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:35,960
Don't worry about it.

472
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,810
Xiu'e, don't worry.

473
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,030
Women shouldn't

474
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,350
meddle in men's business.

475
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,760
- Come on.
- Brother.

476
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,880
Have some peanuts.

477
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,840
Xiu'e.

478
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,840
We're almost out of peanuts.

479
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,160
Go get some.

480
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,790
That's too much. Dad, you eat first.

481
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,240
Go.

482
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,560
Come on.

483
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,110
Come on.

484
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,240
Alright.

485
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,240
Dad, I'll get some peanuts.

486
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,280
Hurry up.

487
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,760
Take the initiative next time.

488
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,750
- Come on, cheers.
- Cheers.

489
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,150
Brother,

490
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,110
does Xiu'e forbid you to drink?

491
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,000
How's that possible?

492
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,270
If I don't drive, I can drink.

493
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,590
She can't control me.

494
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,350
Men need to be free.

495
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,120
Come on, let's keep drinking.

496
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,270
How long will they stay here?

497
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,560
Chinese New Year.

498
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,510
They'll be here until the 7th day.

499
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,110
Women from Shanghai

500
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,350
are so delicate.

501
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,400
She seldom comes back.

502
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,480
Now that she's back,

503
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,920
she doesn't want to do anything.

504
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,480
She's always eating.

505
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,070
Come on, take it inside.

506
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,790
For my sake, please.

507
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,110
Don't be upset, okay?

508
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,350
We had a deal.

509
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,750
Women shouldn't
meddle in men's business.

510
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,160
Well said.

511
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,110
I had to convince them.

512
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,560
Where's Jiali?

513
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,680
The yard is dirty.

514
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,590
Want me to sweep it?

515
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,670
Xiu'e!

516
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,240
Lend a hand right now!

517
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,030
You need to find work to do!

518
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,920
Hurry up!

519
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,920
What are you waiting for?

520
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,390
Dad, right?

521
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:05,920
Come on, Dad, cheers.

522
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,760
Dad.

523
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,030
Here are the peanuts.

524
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,350
Xiu'e, thanks.

525
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,830
- Too slow.
- Thanks, Xiu'e.

526
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,840
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

527
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,480
Come on.

528
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,480
Brother,

529
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,790
Xiu'e seems different.

530
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,110
Really?

531
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,160
She's always like this.

532
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,400
Brother, I'm impressed.

533
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,310
I'm afraid

534
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,920
only you can tame a woman

535
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,480
from Shanghai like this.

536
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,590
Even in Shanghai,

537
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,000
men still take charge.

538
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,400
That's the universal law, isn't it?

539
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,240
Of course.

540
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,350
Qian Kang earns so much every day.

541
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,160
How dare she disobey?

542
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,110
Money doesn't matter.

543
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,640
Harmony brings happiness.

544
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,830
Come on.

545
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,670
Have another drink.

546
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,880
Brother, I'm impressed.

547
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,380
- Dad, here's to you.
- Cheers.

548
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,220
I helped your dad
tidy up the room downstairs.

549
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,350
I took my stuff back.

550
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,640
I didn't touch Jiayue's things.

551
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,110
Actually,

552
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,680
with everything in its place,

553
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,550
it still looks like the old home.

554
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,590
Mao Tou,

555
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,550
your mom left many years ago.

556
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,510
How do you feel about her return?

557
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,310
Nothing.

558
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,960
She'll go back to Japan
after the divorce.

559
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,960
I'll just

560
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,750
help my dad to finish the show.

561
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,720
I have nothing to do with this, right?

562
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,110
Little San.

563
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,150
Auntie.

564
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,520
Coming, coming.

565
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,350
- Open the door.
- Coming.

566
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,310
Wait a minute.

567
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:16,870
Coming.

568
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,000
Welcome!

569
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,550
Same as before?

570
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,080
Same as before.

571
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,350
Where are you going?

572
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,590
Grocery shopping.

573
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,830
Grocery shopping at this hour?

574
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,310
They are all sold out.

575
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,680
Silly boy.

576
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,590
They're cheaper in the evening.

577
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:43,640
I'll get some water.

578
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,440
Auntie, here's the thing.

579
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:46,950
Sometimes,

580
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,270
people change

581
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,920
with the environment.

582
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,920
Now that I've moved back,

583
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,160
I can't sleep at night.

584
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,480
Can't get used to it.

585
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,640
But...

586
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,680
on the other hand,

587
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,110
at least

588
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,350
I feel at ease

589
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,880
when I smell the old house's scent

590
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:07,390
every day.

591
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:08,630
Besides,

592
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:09,920
I can see the most

593
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,790
beautiful lady in our neighborhood

594
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,880
and have some drinks

595
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,920
and play with

596
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,200
those old friends

597
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,720
from childhood.

598
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,350
It's amazing.

599
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,830
Carefree.

600
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,200
You're truly carefree.

601
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,240
Little San,

602
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,240
I came here to ask you something.

603
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,240
You've gone too far this time.

604
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,640
Why would you say you had cancer?

605
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,680
You can't curse yourself.

606
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,400
I had no choice.

607
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,540
Have you thought about it?

608
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,750
If you really had cancer,

609
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,400
Yang Min,

610
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,440
would definitely take Mao Tou away.

611
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:46,510
What would you do then?

612
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,640
You don't understand, Auntie.

613
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,550
We're in the 21st century
and have high technologies.

614
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,550
Cancer doesn't always mean death.

615
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:54,950
I...

616
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,720
Foreign medicine cured my cancer, okay?

617
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,280
I...

618
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,440
It... It somehow healed.

619
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,590
It's a medical miracle,

620
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,430
okay?

621
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:05,310
Are you out of your mind?

622
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,240
I just don't understand.

623
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,550
I had no choice.

624
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,920
Auntie, you know it.

625
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,920
You know everything.

626
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,720
I'm just too old.

627
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,830
What should I do?

628
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,830
Grocery shopping! I forgot it. Bye.

629
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,880
- You haven't finished your water.
- Bye.

630
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,720
Grocery shopping.

631
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:23,640
Auntie, wait a moment.

632
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,440
Are you home tomorrow morning?

633
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,280
Yes.

634
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,760
Well...

635
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,960
I'll buy some good stuff.

636
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,000
Maybe some delicacies and hairtails.

637
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,680
In return, can you fry
two hairtails for us?

638
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,510
The hairtails you made are amazing!

639
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,200
The whole neighborhood can smell it.

640
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,480
Okay, got it.

641
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,960
Hairtails, hairtails.

642
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,030
Okay.

643
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,240
- Goodbye.
- Okay.

644
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,440
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

645
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,920
Here's the small dish.

646
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,830
Wearing sunglasses in winter,

647
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:25,160
does she think she's a from overseas?

648
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,240
The Three Gorges Dam.

649
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,270
Year 1980.

650
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,750
Old Zhang, I'm back.

651
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,110
Mao Tou.

652
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,520
Mao Tou!

653
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,800
You're here.

654
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,270
You should've called.

655
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,830
I could make a banner for you.

656
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,350
Welcome to Shanghai.

657
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:43,670
Suit yourself.

658
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,110
Change shoes?

659
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,240
No need.

660
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,110
This place hasn't changed at all.

661
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,200
It's still the same as before.

662
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:09,920
I thought...

663
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,280
you'd move out.

664
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,160
We couldn't afford it.

665
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,160
We have to stay in the old house
my parents left.

666
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,200
You look good.

667
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,220
People can tell you're

668
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,110
an overseas Chinese.

669
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,640
Have a seat.

670
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,350
Still drinking?

671
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,160
Aren't you ill?

672
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,200
Why are you still drinking?

673
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,640
The doctor said

674
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,350
it's not good

675
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,480
to suddenly quit drinking.

676
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,480
This wine is very cheap.

677
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,590
I only drink a little.

678
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,440
You haven't changed.

679
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,830
You know how to enjoy life.

680
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,070
You can look around.

681
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,400
Make yourself at home.

682
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:07,270
What's wrong with the TV?

683
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,830
It seems the TV is broken.

684
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,110
You look good.

685
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,760
Because of the wine.

686
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,240
I look good, but actually I'm not.

687
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,200
Don't drink too much.

688
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,400
What did the doctor say?

689
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,200
The doctor asked me
to have some foreign medicine.

690
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,400
If they work,

691
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,440
I'll be able to live
another 10 or 20 years.

692
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,280
Right? But...

693
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,640
the medicine is expensive.

694
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,790
Can you help me a bit?

695
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,560
Sure.

696
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:42,920
No problem.

697
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,550
How much do you need?

698
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,240
Is 100 thousand yuan enough?

699
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,400
Yes, that's enough.

700
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,240
I really have

701
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,640
no choice

702
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,790
but to turn to you.

703
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,350
When you wanted to divorce,

704
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:00,030
I was angry and wanted
to stall for time.

705
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,310
Look back,

706
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,510
I should let go, for

707
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:03,720
the sake of both of us.

708
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,030
Instead of feeling stuck

709
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:07,540
inside,

710
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,440
we should both move on
and live a happy life.

711
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,190
So,

712
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:13,160
get a divorce tomorrow and finish it

713
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,590
before the Chinese New Year.

714
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,750
I won't hold you back anymore.

715
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,560
Okay.

716
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,920
Shall we set it for 10 AM tomorrow?

717
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,440
Does that time work for you?

718
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,750
Are you still working?

719
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,440
Not anymore, I was laid off

720
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,480
many years ago.

721
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,830
I've been wandering around.

722
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,550
I've stayed at home since I got sick.

723
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,270
Alright, I'll pick you up
at 10 AM tomorrow.

724
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,160
I'll prepare the money.

725
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,200
You're still straightforward,

726
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,310
just like before.

727
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,720
I'll make you a cup of water.

728
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,830
We're out of tea.

729
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:58,440
I'll get some water.

730
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,430
It's okay.

731
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,920
I didn't look at him carefully.

732
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,030
He's grown up.

733
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,640
So handsome.

734
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,390
Mao Tou.

735
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,390
Mao Tou.

736
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,040
Rebellious phase.

737
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,430
Just like that.

738
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,160
I bought something
for him at the mall,

739
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,790
but I had no idea,

740
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,070
so I bought him sportswear.

741
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,830
I didn't know his size,

742
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,440
so I bought

743
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,920
all three sizes.

744
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,550
I was too embarrassed

745
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,070
to tell the clerk

746
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,790
I was shopping for my son.

747
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,240
I'm such an unfit mother.

748
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,030
I don't even know his height.

749
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,200
No shoes?

750
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:06,670
That's right.

751
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,110
You don't know his shoe size.

752
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,830
When he was
four and a half years old,

753
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,720
you were learning Japanese.

754
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,400
One day, he excitedly

755
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,200
ran over to you and said,

756
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,440
"Mom, I'll teach you a Japanese phrase.

757
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,350
Azimowa, atashiwa."

758
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,920
Before we could react,

759
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,030
he burst into laughter

760
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,830
on the couch.

761
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,160
He said, "I was saying

762
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,830
the shoe isn't broken, but the lace is.

763
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:40,960
It's Shanghainese.

764
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,200
Surprise."

765
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,550
Since you left,

766
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,200
Mao Tou has never laughed like that.

767
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,400
I'll let him try the size.

768
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:01,750
He likes the color.

769
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,280
I know, right?

770
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:05,000
I remember he likes blue.

771
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,720
When I bought car models for him,

772
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,670
he wanted the blue ones.

773
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,350
Thank you.

774
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,150
Back then...

775
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,360
He was this tall when I left.

776
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,240
Five years old.

777
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,960
Now he's going to high school.

778
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,800
What about his grades?

779
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,440
Not good.

780
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,400
He's smart

781
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:28,430
but not focused.

782
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,800
How can he get good grades?

783
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,640
Well...

784
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:42,510
It's enough for today.

785
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:43,870
Tomorrow,

786
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,230
I'll pick you up at 10 AM.

787
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,240
See you tomorrow.

788
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,320
I've prepared the household register.

789
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:17,950
Mao Tou.

790
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:21,920
Well,

791
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,320
I'm leaving.

792
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,880
Goodbye.

793
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,030
I'll walk you out.

you won't know

when you'll see her again.

818
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:00,320
Let's take a break.

819
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,150
Actually, I didn't

820
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:54,880
solve that question either.

821
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:01,250
I'm sorry.

822
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,110
I shouldn't have argued with you
in front of them.

823
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,300
It doesn't matter.

824
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:15,860
I'll leave school after this vacation.

825
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,360
I'll go to Dongguan.

826
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,090
My mom told me I'd find a job

827
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:23,840
after finishing school anyway,

828
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,490
so it's better to start working

829
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,070
and making money for the family now.

830
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,840
Jiali,

831
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,510
your grades are good, right?

832
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,440
If I were in Shanghai like you,

833
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,160
I'd also go to college.

834
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,480
But I have a younger brother.

835
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,530
If only one of us can go to school,

836
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:53,960
it has to be him.

837
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:57,470
Why?

838
00:39:58,630 --> 00:39:59,880
Haven't you told them

839
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,960
you don't want to quit?

840
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,230
What's the point?

841
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,480
My mom was right.

842
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,150
I've never

843
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,360
worried about food and clothing.

844
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,440
And I haven't done much housework.

845
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,990
I'm much better
than other girls in the village.

846
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,120
Of course,

847
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,920
I can't compare to girls in Shanghai.

848
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,070
Jiayue,

849
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,510
maybe

850
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,670
this is my fate.

851
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,440
The stars in Shanghai

852
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,710
are as bright as here, right?

853
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,440
I'm thinking

854
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,070
if stars in Shanghai

855
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,480
are brighter than here,

856
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:05,800
it would be so unfair.

857
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:07,670
Jiali...

858
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,030
Jiali...

859
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:15,990
Baby,

860
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,150
why are you still up this late?

861
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,120
Mom.

862
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:29,920
Jiali said

863
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,630
Aunt wouldn't let her go to school.

864
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,840
She said only her brother
could go to school.

865
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,630
She's going to work.

866
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,470
I think

867
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,840
Jiali might be right.

868
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,280
I'm just a bit luckier than others.

869
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,230
It seems

870
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,510
this world is really unfair.

871
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,920
Xiu'e, come on. Have a seat.

872
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:16,800
Let me give you a massage.

873
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,000
I heard Yang Min

874
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,110
came back.

875
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,320
Zhang Qiming

876
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,710
is pretending to be sick.

877
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,160
Do you think

878
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:33,920
Yang Min will fall for it?
