Right,

191
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,380
Aiping's clinic is doing great.

192
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,380
We plan to

193
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,860
rent the shops next door

194
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,060
and connect them.

195
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,140
Health is a big focus these days.

196
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,100
Look at Aiping,

197
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,380
the best doctor in Putuo!

198
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,380
Just come to our clinic!

199
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:17,980
It's okay.

200
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,260
Zhang Qiming,

201
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,780
you're so lucky

202
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,680
to have married someone

203
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:22,740
as good as Guan Aiping.

204
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,860
Well... I really need to thank

205
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,500
Auntie for helping me

206
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:28,940
marry Aiping.

207
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,100
I...

208
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,020
She paid

209
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:33,940
for our wedding banquet,

210
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:34,890
didn't she?

211
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,750
And she

212
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,340
helped us

213
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,500
buy our wedding rings.

214
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,500
I remember my mom asking,

215
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,240
"Which one's nicer,

216
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,260
red or green?

217
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,740
Which one do you think looks better?"

218
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,660
All those years ago...

219
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,180
Granny!

220
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,660
Granny!

221
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,340
Sweetie!

222
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,900
Sweetie's here!

223
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,860
I told you!

224
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,500
The birthday star is here!

225
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,620
The birthday star is here!

226
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,140
Welcome, birthday star!

227
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,980
Are you done packing up?

228
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:10,890
Almost done.

229
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,140
My reservation is at 6:30 PM.

230
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,580
- Let's leave at 6 PM.
- Don't let them see.

231
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,780
- Hide it.
- No problem.

232
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,500
Did Grandma Chen

233
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,260
give you candy again?

234
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:20,940
I've told you,

235
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,660
don't let her call me Grandma Chen.

236
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,260
"Granny", okay?

237
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,100
I'm not a stranger.

238
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,620
"Granny", "Granny".

239
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,260
Candy's bad for your teeth.

240
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,260
- Drink soda instead.
- Let me hold you.

241
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,250
Look,

242
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,500
of all our kids,

243
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,140
only Chen Mo

244
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,500
and Xiao Han

245
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,620
have a baby, Xiaomei.

246
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,020
We really like her!

247
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,740
Let me pat your little bottom.

248
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,020
Stop patting.

249
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:44,980
Want Grandpa to hold you?

250
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,980
Little bottom. Pat, pat, pat.

251
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,980
Xiu'e and I share

252
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:48,980
the same surname, Chen.

253
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,140
We're family.

254
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,380
Chen, you're right.

255
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,500
Great summary.

256
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,260
Look what I found!

257
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,620
- Look!
- What did you find?

258
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,860
Our front page!

259
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,120
- Incredible!
- The front page?

260
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,580
Do you know them?

261
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,900
(The "Flight Attendants" Are Here)
Who's this?

262
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,460
Granny!

263
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,620
And who's this?

264
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,820
Grandma.

265
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,380
- She knows.
- So...

266
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,620
who's the most beautiful one?

267
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,460
Xiaomei, who's the most beautiful?

268
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,140
Grandma Pei!

269
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,240
Really!

270
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,500
Which one is Grandma?

271
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,780
Where's Grandma?

272
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,020
Grandma.

273
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,380
Yes, yes!

274
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,540
(New Chapter of City's 4050 Initiative)

275
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,750
I can hardly recognize us!

276
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,980
Two goes to the left.

277
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,740
Five goes to the right.

278
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,260
- Right?
- You got it backwards.

279
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,340
Yes, you've got it backwards.

280
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,340
I used to confuse them

281
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,260
when I was little.

282
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,560
Try writing it again.

283
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,260
Chen is so patient with

284
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,380
Xiaomei now.

285
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,340
He's really

286
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,500
mellowed.

287
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,980
He used to be strict
with your daughter,

288
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,300
Chen Mo.

289
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,500
That's what they call

290
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,860
"grandparental love".

291
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,900
Now that he's stepped down,

292
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,740
he's got so much free time.

293
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,140
Thankfully, Xiao Han and Chen Mo

294
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,260
have come back from Beijing.

295
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,020
He spends all his time

296
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,260
with Xiaomei now.

297
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,380
He's almost spoiling her.

298
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,460
His patience is unbelievable.

299
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:58,980
I really didn't expect...

300
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,420
Well…

301
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,420
Out of

302
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,100
all our kids,

303
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,460
Chen Mo is the one

304
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,980
who causes us the least worry.

305
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,140
She graduated from college,
got married right away,

306
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,620
and then had a baby soon after.

307
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,580
It's really nice!

308
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,740
Unlike my baby,

309
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,980
or your daughter Qing.

310
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,030
Two older single women!

311
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,860
What do you mean by

312
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,020
"older single women"?

313
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,740
They're not even thirty yet!

314
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,660
Why can't they be single?

315
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,740
You have to be my age

316
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,620
to be called that!

317
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,900
You sure have thick skin!

318
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,740
Look, Qian Jiayue only went abroad

319
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,980
because you kept pressuring her!

320
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,140
She doesn't want to

321
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:40,980
come back!

322
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,620
- Exactly.
- That's nonsense.

323
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,460
Look,

324
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,340
it's the perfect time

325
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,740
for them to focus on their careers.

326
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,260
The golden period for building a career!

327
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,460
Stop pressuring them.

328
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,900
Jiayue's working abroad,

329
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,860
and Qing's an agent, right?

330
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,260
It's the best time

331
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,460
for them to focus on their work.

332
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,020
Just let them be.

333
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,020
I'm just worried.

334
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,620
Stop worrying so much.

335
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,220
They are really busy.

336
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,340
Sometimes I see Xiao Han

337
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,180
and Mao Tou,

338
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,860
and they can't even take a day off

339
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,140
when they're really busy.

340
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,140
Speaking of Mao Tou,

341
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,620
I haven't seen him in a while.

342
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,500
What's he up to?

343
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,480
He just switched to a job

344
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,720
at a gaming company.

345
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,720
Have Mao Tou and Xiao Han
keep an eye out.

346
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,760
Maybe there's a young talent

347
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,000
in their company

348
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,080
who could be

349
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,000
a good match for Qian Jiayue.

350
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,240
Jiayue's abroad, okay?

351
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,240
Stop worrying about her.

352
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,480
If there's a good match,

353
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,640
I could convince her to come back,

354
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,480
okay?

355
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,080
Speaking of which,

356
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,360
my baby hasn't come back
in over a year...

357
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,600
Let me send her a WeChat message.

358
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,420
Baby,

359
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,660
I'm with

360
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,060
Auntie Aiping,

361
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,340
Auntie Pei,

362
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,820
and Auntie Fangfang.

363
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,100
They all want to set you up with someone!

364
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,080
I can't stop them!

365
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,600
Auntie Pei didn't try to set you up!

366
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,240
Auntie Aiping did.

367
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,000
Baby, when are you coming back?

368
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:02,850
- Qian Jiayue!
- Qian Jiayue!

369
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,610
Ka Men! Chen Mo!

370
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,370
- Long time no see!
- Long time no see!

371
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,200
- What's wrong?
- Got beauty injections?

372
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,040
Next time, I'll take you with me.

373
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,160
Come on, come on,

374
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,200
let's interview
the returning overseas talent.

375
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,200
Why didn't you tell your mom you're back?

376
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,280
I couldn't even tell my mom!

377
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,520
She's always

378
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,720
thinking about getting me married.

379
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,800
If I tell her I'm back,

380
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,960
the next day

381
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,040
she'll drag me to People's Square

382
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,880
for blind dates!

383
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,320
Enjoy your freedom while you can.

384
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,680
Marriage is

385
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,920
a whole different story.

386
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,440
So... what did

387
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,040
Xiao Han do to you?

388
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,520
The pain of being a housewife

389
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,320
is endless!

390
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,480
Divorce.

391
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,320
Then you'll be single again!

392
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,040
Confront Xiao Han about it later.

393
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,920
Why not?

394
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,800
I'm working on a novel right now

395
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,040
about the perfect crime

396
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,720
committed by a housewife

397
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,800
after a divorce.

398
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,400
Our famous web novelist

399
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,920
is giving up on fantasy

400
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,320
to write suspense now?

401
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,320
What famous web novelist?

402
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,320
I'm just stuck at home, bored.

403
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,840
Xiao Han keeps mocking me,

404
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,200
saying I update too often

405
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,320
but don't make a penny.

406
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,560
He's always nagging.

407
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,280
Art comes from life, so that's why

408
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,480
I'm thinking up

409
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,320
a perfect crime for a housewife.

410
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,200
So, does that mean

411
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,560
Xiao Han is in danger?

412
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,520
You bet!

413
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,760
Where is he?

414
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,960
He's with Wang Bin and Liu Jianfeng.

415
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,520
He can't stop once he sees a basketball.

416
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,560
Let's go find him!

417
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,640
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

418
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,560
You really haven't changed at all.

419
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,800
You haven't either.

420
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,120
Jianfeng, catch it!

421
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,400
Here! Pass it!

422
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,840
Here!

423
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,040
Shoot!

424
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,920
Nice shot!

425
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,840
Well done!

426
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,640
Don't fall, buddy.

427
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,240
Nice positioning!

428
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,440
- Nice pass!
- Xiao Han!

429
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,240
Coming!

430
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,360
- Thanks!
- See you.

431
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,200
Thanks!

432
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,440
Look who's here!

433
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,680
Jiayue!

434
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,520
Xiao Han.

435
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,920
Long time no see.

436
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,760
Long time no see.

437
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,240
Jiayue!

438
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,560
Wang Bin.

439
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,880
Your hair...

440
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,240
You've changed so much!

441
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,280
You've changed a lot too.

442
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,680
It's nothing.

443
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,760
I've started a small business.

444
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,440
"A small business".

445
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,760
Hello, teacher!

446
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,600
Hello, teacher!

447
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,480
Hello, students!

448
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,960
You don't look like a teacher.

449
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,160
I look more like one than you.

450
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,720
The school hasn't changed at all!

451
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,370
Being young is so nice.

452
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,160
We're not old yet.

453
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,860
They say, "Thirty is the age
to stand firm."

454
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,340
I'm almost thirty,

455
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,580
but look at me,

456
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,420
I'm nowhere near standing firm yet.

457
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,380
That's an old saying.

458
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,580
Back in the day,

459
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,340
they said life after seventy was rare.

460
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,980
Thirty was almost halfway through life,

461
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,180
so it was natural to "stand firm".

462
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,380
Things are different now.

463
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,300
We've only been out of school
for a few years.

464
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,580
Only a few years,

465
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,580
but I feel like

466
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,580
I've already seen all the ups and downs.

467
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,980
I feel so worn out.

468
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,540
You feel worn out?

469
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,500
I think that's how it is.

470
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,900
Take my dad for example.

471
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,580
He took a long sick leave
in his thirties.

472
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,180
We'll be that age soon,

473
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,780
right?

474
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,020
It's coming fast.

475
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,580
Actually, I haven't told you guys.

476
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,500
I got laid off last month.

477
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,620
It feels a lot like

478
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,900
when our parents got laid off,
doesn't it?

479
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:25,940
In that case,

480
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,100
send me your resume.

481
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,380
I'll help you get a referral.

482
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,740
Our company is hiring...

483
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,540
Xiao Han, you're at
a big foreign enterprise.

484
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,180
I didn't graduate from Tsinghua,

485
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,500
and their requirements

486
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,340
are too high for me.

487
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,420
Give it a shot.

488
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,820
I've decided.

489
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,180
I'm going to Shenzhen next month.

490
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,740
There are some good internet companies

491
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,980
doing well.

492
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,740
Shenzhen?

493
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,820
That's far!

494
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,500
Sure, that foreign enterprise

495
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,820
looks nice,

496
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,660
but private companies aren't bad either.

497
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,180
We have sharp eyes.

498
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,780
My company

499
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,820
is about to dive into e-commerce.

500
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,340
Come work with me!

501
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,180
I tried to get you to join me earlier,

502
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,340
- but you...
- I'm not going.

503
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,420
You're all here?

504
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,380
- Class leader!
- Class leader!

505
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,300
We've been waiting for you
in the classroom!

506
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,140
Class leader.

507
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,580
We're just here

508
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,820
to check in with Mr. Zhou

509
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,780
and look around.

510
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,740
I knew it.

511
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,700
Only the two of us

512
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,980
saw the group notice.

513
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,340
- Who else?
- Two?

514
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,660
- Wuji's here.
- Chang Wuji!

515
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,820
Genius.

516
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,340
Class leader,

517
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,420
did you find anything out?

518
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,380
I did.

519
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,100
Chang Wuji is still single,

520
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,500
but I heard

521
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,980
he's about to go abroad

522
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:40,820
for postdoctoral work.

523
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,820
A perfect match for Qian Jiayue, right?

524
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,380
She's abroad too.

525
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,660
The world's so big.

526
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,500
You need to check

527
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,380
if it's the same country.

528
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,900
What if one's in Antarctica
and the other's

529
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,500
- in the Arctic?
- True.

530
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,780
Then let Jiayue go to
the country where Wuji is!

531
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,340
Exactly!

532
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,820
Men just don't understand!

533
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,380
I have a technical question.

534
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,100
Has Chang Wuji bought a house yet?

535
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,660
A two-bedroom apartment

536
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,180
awarded to our young champion!

537
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,860
("Digital Challenge Arena: Annual Champion
property check)

538
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,820
Can I get the cash equivalent?

539
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,740
My mom says there's no point
in having extra homes.

540
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:15,980
I have a solution.

541
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:16,860
Leave it to me.

542
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,540
Chang Wuji!

543
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,380
Have you bought a house yet?

544
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,380
You couldn't be more direct!

545
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,820
They've all

546
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,660
been out of school for ten years,

547
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,300
and they're still so nosy.

548
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,140
Impressive.

549
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,740
Jiayue.

550
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,820
The last time we met

551
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,060
was ten years ago, right?

552
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,820
It really was!

553
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,280
Chang Wuji...

554
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,120
What a coincidence.

555
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,320
Jiayue, do you want to go to

556
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,200
Changfeng Park with me?

557
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,680
How about we eat at Jiale Wontons?

558
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,400
I'm waiting for someone.

559
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,160
Then...

560
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,120
should I wait with you?

561
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,880
No, no need.

562
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,960
Jiayue,

563
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,840
we've already graduated from high school,

564
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,840
and we're about to start college.

565
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,440
I'm preparing to go to Beijing.

566
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,640
There's something

567
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,640
I've been meaning to tell you.

568
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:49,960
Actually,

569
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,400
every time I see you,

570
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,800
I feel so warm.

571
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,040
When you're happy, I'm happy.

572
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,720
When you're sad,

573
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,120
I feel down too.

574
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,160
Right now,

575
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,080
when you're looking at me like this,

576
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,600
my ears are burning,

577
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,280
my heart is racing,

578
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,400
and my palms are sweating!

579
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,640
That's all I wanted to say.

580
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,360
Thank you, Chang Wuji.

581
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,640
You're welcome.

582
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,400
I mean...

583
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,560
I just see you

584
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,840
as a classmate,

585
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,680
a good friend.

586
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,560
That's okay.

587
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,400
Don't feel

588
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,880
uncomfortable.

589
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,280
Actually...

590
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,480
today...

591
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,840
I have a few more words

592
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,880
I want to

593
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,280
say to you.

594
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:04,960
You're great.

595
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,120
You're wonderful.

596
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,640
You deserve all the attention

597
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,840
and care.

598
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,840
When she is at her most disappointed

599
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,640
about not meeting Sailor,

600
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,720
someone who

601
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,400
cares about her would appear

602
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,640
and say,

603
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,400
"You're great.

604
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,960
You're wonderful.

605
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,120
You deserve all the attention

606
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,120
and care."

607
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,720
You...

608
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,320
You really are wonderful.

609
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,880
The last line was from me.

610
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,080
"The last line"?

611
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,040
What do you mean?

612
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,440
You... Don't wait too long.

613
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,080
Go home early.

614
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,160
Jiayue,

615
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,400
so

616
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,040
over these years,

617
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,080
have you felt at ease?

618
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,120
Sometimes, I feel at ease.

619
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,080
Other times, I'm just pretending to be.

620
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,240
What about you?

621
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,240
Me?

622
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,360
I don't know how to act!

623
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,040
You know that.

624
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,120
You're still the Chang Wuji I know.

625
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,640
Enough chatting!

626
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,480
Hey, you two.

627
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,400
Mr. Zhou's class is over.
Let's go meet him.

628
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,440
Okay.

629
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,720
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

630
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,560
Let's go.

631
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,480
Let's go.

632
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,640
My students,

633
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,840
(Welcome 1999 Graduates Come Back)

634
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,280
it's been ten years.

635
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,880
How many times

636
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,400
have you come back to visit me?

637
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,480
Mr. Zhou, I'm the most obedient.

638
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,120
I visit every year for Teacher's Day.

639
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,880
Pei Dongni has been the most dedicated.

640
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,200
Mr. Zhou, it's not our fault.

641
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,560
We don't live in Shanghai.

642
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,880
We just came back last year.

643
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,880
Chen Mo, let me tell you,

644
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,840
Ms. Wu still talks about you.

645
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,040
She says you have snatched

646
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:20,880
her student council chairman away.

647
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,040
Xiao Han,

648
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,240
I heard

649
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,320
you're working

650
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,040
in a high-tech foreign company, right?

651
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,400
Not really.

652
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,240
I'm just a programmer.

653
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,160
He's being humble
in front of me!

654
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,720
Qian Jiayue, I remember now.

655
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,920
A couple of years ago, Zhao Tingting

656
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,760
came back to visit

657
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,120
and told me

658
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:42,960
she had got an MBA abroad,

659
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,600
and she's working in

660
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,160
some hedge fund on Wall Street...

661
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,600
I said, "Qian Jiayue is in New York too.

662
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,640
Haven't you met?"

663
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,600
Mr. Zhou, the difference is too big now.

664
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,880
She's on Wall Street, while I

665
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,280
might live on the street one day.

666
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,120
I can't compare to Zhao Tingting,

667
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,480
who's a real corporate professional.

668
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,440
I studied marketing.

669
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,920
Lately, I've been exploring
opportunities back home.

670
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,960
Really? Are you coming back?

671
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,560
Are you sure?

672
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,280
I'm not sure yet.

673
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,240
Liu Wanqing,

674
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,960
I heard you're in the entertainment industry.

675
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,800
Lu Yao's agent!

676
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,600
That's right! Why didn't Lu Yao come?

677
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,440
Lu Yao...

678
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,720
- Looks like Lu Yao
- He...

679
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,120
really made it big.

680
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,200
Understandable.

681
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,880
No, no, Lu Yao still has work to do.

682
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,720
He asked me

683
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,320
to apologize to everyone.

684
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,920
If there's a second round,

685
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,840
he'll definitely come back
to see everyone.

686
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,680
Got it, understood.

687
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,280
Ka Men, I have a question for you.

688
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,680
That movie actor

689
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,800
from a while ago,

690
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,200
and the actress...
Are they dating?

691
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,560
The one with the name ABB!

692
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,400
Who?

693
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,880
Is it real news?

694
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,440
Is it true?

695
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,880
Sorry, I can't disclose that.

696
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,600
It's about the drama

697
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,880
from a while ago...

698
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,280
My students,

699
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,600
it's been ten years.

700
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,640
I'm really happy

701
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,120
to see you here today.

702
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,920
Among you all,

703
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,560
some have become elites,

704
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,360
and some have even become stars.

705
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,800
Their agent, actually.

706
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,480
Some have faced

707
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,920
temporary difficulties in life.

708
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,680
I have inhaled
chalk dust for a lifetime.

709
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,480
I'm not in a position

710
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,320
to tell you,

711
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,640
in this society outside of campus,

712
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,920
in this era,

713
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,120
how you can

714
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,320
succeed,

715
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,400
but your

716
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,640
fifteen-year-old faces

717
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,040
are still vivid

718
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,200
in my mind.

719
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,800
Every time I see new,

720
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,400
young faces on campus,

721
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,440
I wonder,

722
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,440
what are you

723
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,680
like now?

724
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,680
Do you still have

725
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,120
the same confusion

726
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,880
and passion for life

727
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,720
you had when you were young?

728
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,120
Do you still argue about what fairness

729
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,200
and justice mean?

730
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,200
Do you still have friends

731
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,800
you can trust?

732
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,160
Have you faced

733
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,440
your parents' challenges?

734
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,840
Do you have the strength

735
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,080
to persevere like they did?

736
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,640
Do you have children now?

737
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,120
How are you educating them?

738
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,920
Do you see

739
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,560
your younger self in them?

740
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,000
My students,

741
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,920
please always remember

742
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,200
your fifteen-year-old self!

743
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,400
Remember the dreams

744
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,160
you had at fifteen.

745
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,480
Remember how you imagined

746
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,840
the world at fifteen.

747
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,720
Even if your life

748
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,760
is ordinary now,

749
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,400
stand tall

750
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,080
with integrity,

751
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,320
and say to your younger self,

752
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,480
"I didn't let you down."

753
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,200
We just finished seeing Mr. Zhou.

754
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,040
The classmates have all left.

755
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,640
Are you done on your end?

756
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,880
Then hurry over here.

757
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,160
Alright, we'll meet later.

758
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,880
Alright, see you later.

759
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,080
Alright. Take care.

760
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,080
Sure.

761
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,240
Ka Men, did you finish the call?

762
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,440
For the second round,

763
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,880
I'll arrange a meal for everyone.

764
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,720
- Boss.
- Okay?

765
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,000
We might not be able to make it.

766
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,040
It's my mom's birthday.

767
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,640
I can't skip it.

768
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,520
Then we won't bother with food.

769
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,960
I just made a call.

770
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,240
I'll take you somewhere instead.

771
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,440
Where to?

772
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,440
It's a secret.

773
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,880
This is getting mysterious.

774
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,080
- Alright.
- Chang Wuji, are you going?

775
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,600
Jiayue,

776
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,480
are you going?

777
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,640
You guys go ahead.

778
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,040
I need to meet someone first.

779
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,280
Is this person

780
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,000
more important than us and Chang Wuji?

781
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,920
- Yeah.
- Really, more important than me?

782
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,760
It's an old friend
I lost contact with long ago.

783
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,660
(Log In)

784
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,560
(Reed)

785
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,940
(Sailor)

786
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,700
(Sailor)

787
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,420
(Sailor: Reed, happy birthday!
How have you been recently?)

788
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:47,870
(Sailor)

789
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,050
- Sailor!
- Sailor!

790
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,700
Qian Jiayue, are you serious

791
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,020
about meeting an online friend?

792
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,100
Didn't you say he just disappeared back then?

793
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,900
Now, that guy is

794
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,980
over forty,

795
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,180
almost fifty if you round it off!

796
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,380
Old man!

797
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,980
And there are even more bad people online

798
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,380
than before,

799
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,220
Qian Jiayue.

800
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,500
It's pretty amazing that, after so many years

801
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,740
of being out of touch,

802
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,340
we were able to get back in touch.

803
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,980
I'll just have a coffee first,

804
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,220
and then I'll come to you.

805
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,580
Jiayue,

806
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,180
you should meet him.

807
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,100
It's been ten years.

808
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,620
It's time to meet an old friend.

809
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,220
Alright.

810
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:34,900
(Xiaduo Garden)

811
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,580
Qian Jiayue.

812
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,700
Mao Tou?

813
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,460
What are you doing here?

814
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,180
What a coincidence.

815
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,660
I just came back yesterday.

816
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,020
Do you work around here?

817
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,500
I'm here...

818
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,100
to meet an online friend.

819
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:47,860
(The Catcher in the Rye)

820
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,620
Hello, Reed.

821
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,500
I'm Sailor.

822
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:09,430
Been abroad so long

823
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,350
that you can't understand
Chinese anymore?

824
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:13,790
No...

825
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:16,780
You...

826
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,220
No...

827
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,260
Are you crazy?

828
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,780
Hey!

829
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,780
How could you lie to me like this?

830
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,780
And you've been lying to me for so long?

831
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,780
- You haven't changed.
- No...

832
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,500
Alright, let's go have a coffee.

833
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,460
It's a long story, okay?

834
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,060
What long story?

835
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:35,980
Alright, alright.

836
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,980
(Xiaduo Garden)

837
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,340
Ka Men,

838
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,220
why did you bring us here?

839
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,220
Take a look around.

840
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,140
Doesn't this place look familiar?

841
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,460
Doesn't it remind you

842
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,620
of somewhere we used to go?

843
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,700
Liu,

844
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:55,860
is that

845
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,060
the place you used to live?

846
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,860
- Yeah!
- Demolished.

847
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,340
It's been so long.

848
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,060
Yes, that's it!

849
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,380
I used to get

850
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,780
so many tea eggs here.

851
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,940
I can cook some for you.

852
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,540
Sure.

853
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,860
I haven't seen Shanghai

854
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,860
from this angle for ages.

855
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,180
When would we even
have the time for that?

856
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,340
Well, Lu Yao has a friend,

857
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,340
a singer,

858
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,780
who wants to shoot an MV here

859
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,180
in Shanghai at a special location.

860
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,780
I thought of that rooftop…

861
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,140
but it got demolished.

862
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,900
After a lot of searching,
I found this spot.

863
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,220
Lu Yao will bring his friend over soon.

864
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,060
What friend? Is it a celebrity?

865
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,020
Definitely.

866
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:35,900
They said it's a singer.

867
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,060
I don't know, honestly.

868
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:38,620
Xiao Han,

869
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,260
I remember when we

870
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,300
came by here before,

871
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,940
all we saw was the Oriental Pearl Tower,

872
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,180
no other tall buildings.

873
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:46,860
Jinmao Tower was there

874
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,700
when we were students.

875
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,020
No way!

876
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,300
- It wasn't.
- It was.

877
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,340
There was nothing back then.

878
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,380
- No way!
- Check it.

879
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,780
- It was there.
- Impossible.

880
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,780
No need to check.

881
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,020
Jinmao Tower was completed

882
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:57,860
in August 1999.

883
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,420
It was already there back then.

884
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:00,940
No way!

885
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:01,980
- I live nearby.
- See?

886
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,260
That's impossible.

887
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,140
If Chang Wuji says it was there,

888
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,460
- it surely was!
- It surely was!

889
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,660
Ka Men!

890
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,380
Qian Jiayue.

891
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,740
- Look who's here!
- Mao Tou.

892
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,180
- Hi!
- What are you doing here

893
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,020
at our class reunion?

894
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,020
Wherever there's excitement,

895
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:17,860
I'm there.

896
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,500
You finally showed up.

897
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,100
You too.

898
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,540
You're always around.

899
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:25,900
Chang Wuji.

900
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,180
So, how did it go?

901
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,060
Did you meet Sailor?

902
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,700
Was he an old man

903
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,660
you regretted meeting?

904
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,980
I guess so?

905
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,940
I told you, online dating isn't reliable!

906
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,820
Yeah, be careful
with online relationships.

907
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:42,980
Lu Yao!

908
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,220
Big star!

909
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,140
Hi!

910
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,380
Big star!

911
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,740
You've changed so much.

912
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,780
Looking great!

913
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,740
Your hair...

914
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,340
I'm getting old, and my head gets cold.

915
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,420
You're wearing glasses.

916
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:56,820
Trying to look scholarly?

917
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,500
- Your clothes shine!
- Real leather?

918
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,460
Guess.

919
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,340
Faux leather?

920
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,620
- Faux leather!
- It's faux.

921
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,060
Long time no see.

922
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,220
Ka Men, this place is really nice.

923
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,660
Of course.

924
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,660
The place I find has to be
as good-looking as me.

925
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,340
As expected of her.

926
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,140
So, to thank you,

927
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,140
big agent,

928
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,540
guess who I invited?

929
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,220
Who?

930
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,100
He's here.

931
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,460
Hi, Jeff!

932
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,980
Jeff Chang!

933
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,180
Hey, everyone!

934
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,460
I've heard from Lu that
you're all his best friends.

935
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,540
Yes, yes! Yes, I am!

936
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,740
I'm his best friend!

937
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,780
I've been your idol for years... no,

938
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,180
you've been my idol for years!

939
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,140
I'll tell you what,

940
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,220
my wife's been your fan
since she was young.

941
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,340
When chasing her, I sang your song

942
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,300
"White Moon" for her!

943
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,380
She loved it!

944
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,220
Jeff,

945
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,900
you're the first singer my bestie likes.

946
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,260
She's loved you her whole life.

947
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,100
Ka Men!

948
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,420
Quick, wipe those tears.

949
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,500
Thanks.

950
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,130
So it's you!

951
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,200
You're so annoying!

952
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,640
It's a surprise for you.

953
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,640
Jeff,

954
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,800
it's so nice to see you.

955
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,960
I went to your signing event back then.

956
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,240
I chased you

957
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,880
to the parking lot with your album,

958
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,160
and you signed it for me

959
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,000
and even gave me a cup of milk tea.

960
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,680
Really?

961
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,440
But later...

962
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,080
my mom drank it.

963
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,970
I chased your...

964
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,560
your car and...

965
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:34,570
yelled,

966
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,700
"Jeff, keep going!"

967
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:38,120
Thank you so much.

968
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,270
So, today is your class reunion?

969
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:45,350
- Yes.
- That's right.

970
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:46,190
Yes, Jeff.

971
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:48,230
Today is our 10-year class reunion.

972
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:49,630
Ten years, huh?

973
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:52,030
You're still able to
gather together like this.

974
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,710
That's really wonderful.

975
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,670
Yeah, ten years ago,

976
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,430
we were on the rooftop over there.

977
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:58,390
All of us.

978
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,950
After school that day...

979
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:01,150
We'd just had a fight!

980
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:02,670
We fought! That's right!

981
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,590
And then we sat on the rooftop

982
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:05,590
in a row.

983
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:08,110
The sun was about to go down,

984
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,750
and we sang a song.
