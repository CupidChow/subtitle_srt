00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,540
My baby needs it.

192
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,220
It's not just for our baby.

193
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,420
I want it too.

194
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,540
What happened?

195
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,660
It's about time to choose her college.

196
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,100
She has no idea at all.

197
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,500
(Gaokao Application Guide)

198
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,140
Baby, medicine is good.

199
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,100
If you study medicine,
you can become a doctor.

200
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,380
She is studying liberal arts.

201
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,460
She can't study medicine.

202
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,860
Then she can study TCM.

203
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,740
Aiping can also

204
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,900
help her.

205
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,980
- TCM is suitable.
- Mom, we...

206
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,460
Yes.

207
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,140
And computer science.

208
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:58,980
Look at this.

209
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,260
It's always in demand.

210
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,620
- Computer science.
- It's good.

211
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,620
Baby had

212
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,140
a computer in Grade 10.

213
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,900
It's a high starting point, right?

214
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,140
But I don't know if this major

215
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,780
belongs to liberal arts or sciences.

216
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,260
Look at this, law.

217
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,740
- Being a lawyer is good.
- We...

218
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,020
Science and engineering...

219
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,020
So, what universities and majors

220
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,380
did your kids choose?

221
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,260
Tell me.

222
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,540
It can help my baby make decisions.

223
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,500
Han has been clear

224
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,660
about this since childhood.

225
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,020
That is...

226
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,460
Jiao Tong University.

227
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,900
My dad and I had a deal.

228
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,620
I will definitely get in.

229
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:41,980
Have you decided

230
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,260
on a major yet?

231
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,140
Not yet.

232
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,020
It must be Jiao Tong University.

233
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:50,980
Great.

234
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,020
Well, Han is

235
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,140
a top student.

236
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,260
He'll do well in the exam.

237
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,340
With the scores,

238
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,500
he can get into any university.

239
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,620
Yes, and he has extra points.

240
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,460
Exactly.

241
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,780
What extra points?

242
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,660
Xiao Han will be the model student

243
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,500
of the city.

244
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,460
He'll get 20 extra points.

245
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,700
20 points?

246
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,380
Oh, no.

247
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,140
He hasn't got it.

248
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,020
Don't talk nonsense.

249
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,140
That's a good thing.

250
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:19,980
Fangfang,

251
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,540
how's Momo doing?

252
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,620
Don't mention it.

253
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,980
I talked with Lu today

254
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,260
about Momo's university.

255
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,340
SUIBE is a good choice.

256
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,260
If she does well in the exam,

257
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,020
she can choose

258
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,380
two tier-1 majors.

259
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,540
If it's not that good,

260
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,980
she'll have to choose

261
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,460
a tier-2 major.

262
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,340
SUIBE is great, Momo.

263
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,740
It's good

264
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,300
for a girl

265
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,300
to study economics.

266
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,780
She'll easily find a job.

267
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,380
She can also become a civil servant.

268
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,980
Yu has promised me

269
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,220
his foreign trade company

270
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,860
will hire Momo after she

271
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,060
graduates.

272
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,140
That's wonderful.

273
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,380
And there's Wang Qiong.

274
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,220
She said

275
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,340
Momo can go to her company,

276
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,380
and she'll take care of her.

277
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,740
I won't go to SUIBE.

278
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:22,950
And then?

279
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,550
Then...

280
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:26,110
She didn't tell us.

281
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,350
Well, does

282
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,470
Chen Mo want to go to

283
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,870
Jiao Tong University?

284
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,990
With her grades,

285
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,590
how can she get into Jiao Tong University?

286
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:34,910
Fangfang.

287
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,830
That's a wrong attitude.

288
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,750
Whether she can get in or not,

289
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,590
don't give her more pressure.

290
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,310
It seems that

291
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,510
Qing has been

292
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,110
so stressed out

293
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,230
that she went crazy.

294
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:53,950
Qing,

295
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,590
have a fried egg.

296
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:58,830
Thank you,

297
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,350
Ma'am.

298
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,230
This fried egg

299
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,910
is shining

300
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,110
like the sun.

301
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:09,430
It's a rare delicacy in this world.

302
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,510
Is it really this delicious?

303
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,550
Yes.

304
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,350
Have some eggplant.

305
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:25,710
Oh my god,

306
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,230
my old friend.

307
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,350
This

308
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,750
fish-flavored eggplant

309
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,910
truly brightens

310
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,590
the meal.

311
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:36,980
See?

312
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,060
That's how it is.

313
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,420
Every day!

314
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,780
Oh, my dear mother!

315
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,580
Oh, my old friend!

316
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,420
She calls Liu Songming an old friend,

317
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,260
you know?

318
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,220
It's scary.

319
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,500
Pei,

320
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,260
I think you should be careful.

321
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,380
Qing seems happy and cheerful,

322
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,180
but she's quite sensitive,

323
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,700
just like me.

324
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,820
You, the wonton seller!

325
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,020
Happiness

326
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,020
is just our protective shell.

327
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,900
It can hide

328
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,780
our fragile and vulnerable

329
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,660
bodies and souls.

330
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:13,900
It's annoying.

331
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,660
I should give you an acupuncture.

332
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,500
Come on.

333
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,180
Ms. Huang, where's my knife?

334
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,500
Bring me my knife, please.

335
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,780
I really want to hurt someone.

336
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:26,140
(Good News: Chang Wuji from Class 1 won

- Coming.

look at this lavish feast.

350
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,020
We truly feel happy for you.

be generous,

My Lord.

354
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,540
What do you mean?

355
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,820
You've got direct admission.

356
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,980
You should treat us.

357
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:53,540
Treat! Treat! Treat!

358
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,820
What's it got to do with you?

359
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,900
You're in Grade 11.

360
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,700
Why are you always hanging out with us?

361
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,420
What's wrong with Grade 11?

362
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,340
I like it.

363
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,780
Can't I experience the study vibe?

364
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,740
I want to learn from you.

365
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,100
Is that okay, Jiayue?

366
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,460
Sorry, guys.

367
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,220
I didn't know I had to treat.

368
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,700
This is all the money I have.

369
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,620
Chang Wuji,

370
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,660
look at you.

371
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,260
You're the only one

372
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,180
who got direct admission
to Tsinghua University.

373
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,300
Is this all you've got?

374
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,820
Don't bully Chang Wuji, guys.

375
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,180
Chang Wuji, just one cold drink
for each person.

376
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,180
It's not your money.

377
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,340
Why are you

378
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,180
so stingy?

379
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,940
We shouldn't waste money.

380
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,500
When Chang Wuji

381
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,740
gave the money to her,

382
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,940
it was so natural, right?

383
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,460
It was like handing over

384
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,580
his salary, right?

385
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,580
It's like...

386
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,420
- Don't talk nonsense.
- Exactly.

387
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,780
Qian Jiayue was Class 5's

388
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,740
Life Committee Member.

389
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,660
When you handed over class fees,

390
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,260
you also did it naturally.

391
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,180
Yes.

392
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,740
None of you paid more
than Mao Tou did.

393
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:53,860
Mao Tou.

394
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,220
But Xiao Han has never
treated us before.

395
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,060
As the

396
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,500
City Model Student,

397
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,660
you're just like Chang Wuji.

398
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,820
You have to treat us.

399
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,500
Xiao Han, treat! Xiao Han, treat!

400
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,340
Okay, okay.

401
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,700
No problem, I'll treat.

402
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,700
I'll treat everyone to wontons
this weekend

403
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:11,900
at Ka Men's place.

404
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,900
- Great.
- Okay.

405
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,460
That's so wonderful!

406
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,540
Oh, my dear friends,

407
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,340
let's raise our glasses

408
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,940
to celebrate the success
of our classmates.

409
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,500
It's truly unbelievable!

410
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,020
There are

411
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,780
two such amazing people among us.

412
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,620
Wait, Ka Men.

413
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,620
Ka Men,

414
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,820
don't do that.

415
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,740
You're scaring us a little.

416
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,220
Please speak properly.

417
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,060
Are you sick?

418
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,060
This is unbelievable, Wang Bin!

419
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:39,980
Believe it or not,

420
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,180
I'll kick your butt!

421
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,340
I swear I will!

422
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,260
You've been watching
foreign movies, right?

423
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,980
- She's been preparing...
- Oh my God!

424
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,580
Lu Yao, don't say it.

425
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,980
Let's keep the surprise

426
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,340
until the end.

427
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,660
Cheers!

428
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,900
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

429
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:57,780
Cheers!

430
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,100
Let's toast to the City Model Student

431
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,500
and the Tsinghua University student.

432
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,580
- Come on.
- Cheers!

433
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,420
We'll go to the restroom.

434
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,740
Ka Men, come with us.

435
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,740
Is it that urgent?

436
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,980
What about the food?

437
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,180
I'll finish the fish for you.

438
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:14,940
Go ahead.

439
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,640
What's going on with you lately?

440
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,990
We're really worried about you.

441
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,180
Oh, my dear friends...

442
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,090
Speak properly!

443
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,260
- Actually...
- Be normal.

444
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,180
Okay.

445
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,920
I'm taking the art exam.

446
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,360
Art exam?

447
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,200
For Shanghai Theatre Academy.

448
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,120
STA?

449
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,480
Lu Yao and I both applied for it.

450
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,400
We've already got into the third round.

451
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,720
He applied for acting,

452
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,760
and I applied for directing.

453
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,880
If we get in,

454
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,480
I'll manage him.

455
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,040
Oh, no.

456
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,680
I'll manage the actors.

457
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,560
Ka Men,

458
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,840
look,

459
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,480
did you take the art exam for Lu Yao

460
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,200
or for yourself?

461
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,400
It's definitely because I like it.

462
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,720
I don't know if I can pass.

463
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,680
Lu Yao told me

464
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,760
they added translated-film questions,

465
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,880
so I've been practicing.

466
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,920
My parents don't know.

467
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,480
Please keep the secret for me.

468
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,160
No problem.

469
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,720
Alright.

470
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,240
That's the news.

471
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,640
I was thinking about

472
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,240
telling you guys.

473
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,360
I'm sorry.

474
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:51,960
It's okay.

475
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,640
Okay, let's go to the restroom.

476
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,680
- Come on.
- Let's go.

477
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,480
You're really amazing.

478
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,160
Guys...

479
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,520
Wait a second.

480
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,240
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

481
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,880
Actually,

482
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,240
I've always wanted

483
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,680
to tell you something.

484
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,200
- What is it?
- What is it?

485
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,800
I want to go to Beijing.

486
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,160
Beijing?

487
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,120
Did your parents ask you to?

488
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,200
No.

489
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,720
They don't know.

490
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,320
Then why...?

491
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,040
It's my decision.

492
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,560
Your decision?

493
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,760
To Beijing?

494
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,520
I want to go to another city.

495
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,800
I want to leave home

496
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,320
and Shanghai.

497
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,160
Just to avoid your dad?

498
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,680
It's not just to avoid my dad.

499
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,200
I really want to go

500
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,600
far away.

501
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,720
I want to know

502
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,040
how far I can go on my own.

503
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,480
How high is the sky,

504
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,200
and how vast is the world?

505
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,520
You have to see it for yourself.

506
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:03,920
Anyway,

507
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,560
I've lived here for eighteen years,

508
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,880
and I want to see how wonderful

509
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,480
the outside world is.

510
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,040
I just remembered.

511
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,240
In Grade 10, you said you wanted

512
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,240
to go to Beijing.

513
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,080
The sky in Beijing is so blue,

514
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:27,920
and the roads are wide.

515
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,480
I really want to go to Beijing.

516
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,680
Well...

517
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,560
You'll go to Beijing,

518
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,160
and you'll stay in Shanghai.

519
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,360
What about me?

520
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,840
I didn't expect

521
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,680
you'd make

522
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,080
such a big decision

523
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,400
on your own.

524
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,840
Have you made up your mind?

525
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,080
Not yet.

526
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,240
That's okay.

527
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,640
We're here with you.

528
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,840
Does Xiao Han know?

529
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,600
He'll go to Jiao Tong University,

530
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,680
and you'll go to Beijing.

531
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,400
So, you two...

532
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,320
I'm planning to

533
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,840
tell him about it.

534
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,320
Shanghai Model Student.

535
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,400
20 extra points.

536
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,320
That's impressive.

537
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,280
Jiao Tong University is just
a piece of cake.

538
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,840
I haven't got the title.

539
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,040
Right now it's just

540
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,320
the school's application phase.

541
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,840
Next, I have to pass
the interview and the physical test

542
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,160
at the city level.

543
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,320
You're like a monkey.

544
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,680
The physical test

545
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,680
is a piece of cake.

546
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,640
I've asked about it.

547
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,280
In our school's history,

548
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,760
once you apply for it,

549
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,160
you'll definitely get it.

550
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,480
You're in the same school.

551
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,480
You can apply next year.

552
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,280
If he goes to a tier-2 university,

553
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,320
I'd laugh in my dreams.

554
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,640
Tier-2?

555
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,600
I'll go to a tier-1 university.

556
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,320
Tier 2 is too easy for me.

557
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,360
I support you.

558
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,760
It's good

559
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,240
to have a dream and ideal.

560
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,400
My dream

561
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,560
is this big!

562
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,520
Hurry up.

563
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,600
You're too slow.

564
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,760
Aiping,

565
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,880
let's have a rowing race

566
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,880
with your friends and their families

567
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,480
at the Changfeng Park

568
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,600
on the Dragon Boat Festival.

569
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,000
Han, your task is to

570
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,880
cooperate with Mao Tou

571
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,000
and make sure our team wins first place.

572
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,480
The Gaokao is coming.

573
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,920
Mao Tou can go. He's only in Grade 11.

574
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:40,920
You'll both go.

575
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,040
You both need to balance study and life.

576
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,320
Do you really believe him?

577
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,880
We're not young anymore.

578
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,080
Rowing dragon boats?

579
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,360
Don't your back and legs hurt?

580
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,160
With Doctor Aiping,

581
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,760
it's no big deal.

582
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,120
Here, Han.

583
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,260
(Late Husband, Xiao Youguang)

584
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,340
The lighter is in the basket.

585
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:49,660
(Late Husband, Xiao Youguang)

586
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,140
Youguang, we're here to see you.

587
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,180
Everything's good.

588
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,140
Don't worry.

589
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:06,940
Please bless Aiping

590
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,100
with good health.

591
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,100
Bless Han

592
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,780
to get into his dream university.

593
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,780
(Late Husband, Xiao Youguang)

594
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,620
Let's take a walk

595
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:36,860
around here.

596
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,900
Let's talk.

597
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,300
Han, do you know

598
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,060
the best universities in Shanghai?

599
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,580
University?

600
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,540
Yes.

601
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,740
I don't know.

602
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,100
Let me tell you.

603
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,700
One is Fudan University,

604
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,500
and the other is Jiao Tong University.

605
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,540
Which one do you want to go
when growing up?

606
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,340
I want to go to

607
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,260
Jiao Tong University.

608
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,140
Why?

609
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,500
I'm not a hen.
[*Fudan: Hatch]

610
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,380
I don't hatch eggs.

611
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,340
I want to direct traffic
[*Jiao Tong: Traffic]

612
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,540
like a police officer.

613
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,500
Han, listen,

614
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,100
Fudan University doesn't hatch eggs.

615
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,100
Jiao Tong University
doesn't direct traffic.

616
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,340
But I went to

617
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,500
Jiao Tong University.

618
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,700
Let's make a deal.

619
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,660
When you grow up,

620
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,300
you'll go to Jiao Tong University,

621
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,300
- okay?
- Okay.

622
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,140
Come on, pinky promise.

623
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,020
Pinky promise,

624
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,060
stay true

625
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:36,900
for a hundred years.

626
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,500
Dad,

627
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,660
don't worry.

628
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,900
I've always remembered our promise.

629
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,540
Jiao Tong University.

630
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,100
I'm sure I can get in.

631
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,100
(Late Husband, Xiao Youguang)

632
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:55,940
Just rest

633
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,260
in peace.

634
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,860
Don't worry about me

635
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,140
or Mom.

636
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,100
She's doing

637
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:06,620
really well.

638
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,020
When I get into the university,

639
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,820
I'll visit you again.

640
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,100
Let's meet on the rooftop

641
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,820
after school.

642
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,420
Xiao Han.

643
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:13,940
Nothing.

644
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:14,980
Good luck.

645
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,580
Chen Mo,

646
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,940
Ms. Wu wants to talk to you.

647
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:21,700
Now?

648
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:22,980
The office.

649
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,420
Have you heard?

650
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,020
There's big news about Chen Mo.

651
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,300
What happened?

652
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,540
Nothing.

653
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,420
Stand up.

654
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,420
Hello, teacher.

655
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,260
Sit down.

656
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,460
Xiao Han,

657
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,500
go to the office.

658
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,340
It's Mr. Zhou.

659
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,340
Right now?

660
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,500
Yes, go now.

661
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,100
Okay.

662
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,100
Guys, let's continue with

663
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,140
yesterday's paper.

664
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,340
What is a model student?

665
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,300
Good academic performance,

666
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,500
good moral character, and

667
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,500
(Han: 100 points!)
good health.

668
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,500
(Han: After school? Mo: Friends.)

669
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,300
The school is clearly
against puppy love.

670
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,940
Whoever is involved in this

671
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,780
doesn't have good

672
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,060
moral character,

673
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,660
and they can't meet

674
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,860
the standard of a model student.

675
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:25,860
Xiao Han,

676
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,500
someone told me

677
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:28,700
you were dating.

678
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,900
I was really shocked.

679
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,620
Many teachers who know you well

680
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,900
still can't believe it.

681
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,100
I discussed it with other

682
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,020
class advisors.

683
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,020
We only know one side of the story.

684
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,780
We want to hear it

685
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,140
from you.

686
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,620
According to the reporter,

687
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,500
you two are very high-profile.

688
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,260
It's not difficult for us

689
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,180
to investigate

690
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,580
this event.

691
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,260
We're normal friends

692
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,620
who often hang out

693
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,620
together.

694
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,460
Really?

695
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,420
During the Grade 11 rural survey,

696
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,700
you two watched
a meteor shower together.

697
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,780
Your dad even came to school for this,

698
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,940
and wanted you to transfer schools.

699
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,420
It caused a scene.

700
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,500
Look at what you two wrote.

701
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,700
(Mo: Pig. Han: Cute.)

702
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,260
(Mo: Call me Genius.
Han: What's up, Genius?)

703
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:23,500
(Mo: I scored 12 points higher.
Han: 100 points higher than you.)

704
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,820
(Mo: Math is hard.
Han: How many points?)

705
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:29,860
Xiao Han,

706
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,180
good luck.

707
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,100
They're both young.

708
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,580
It's normal for students

709
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,780
to have feelings

710
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,020
for each other.

711
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,340
They're not all puppy love.

712
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,020
But we don't encourage this

713
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,300
for high school students.

714
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,300
The point is what they do

715
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,340
together.

716
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,620
We need to find out

717
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,340
if they're crossing

718
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,420
the boundary of youth

719
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,860
or just encouraging

720
00:30:58,860 --> 00:30:59,700
and helping

721
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,020
each other.

722
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,380
Mr. Zhou,

723
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,060
how do we define this boundary?

724
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,860
Should we keep an eye on them every day

725
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,060
and stop them

726
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,380
when they're about to

727
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,380
cross the line?

728
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,540
A model student should

729
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,260
set a great example.

730
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,620
If he's a model student,

731
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,460
what will he encourage?

732
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,140
To date someone?

733
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,060
Who will be responsible
if anything happens?

734
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,860
Mr. Xiao, please calm down.

735
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,140
Let's not make it a big deal.

736
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,140
Let's focus on this.

737
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,420
Let's just talk about

738
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,580
Xiao Han and Chen Mo.

739
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,860
In my opinion,

740
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,140
you can't say

741
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:29,980
they're dating

742
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,100
or have feelings

743
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,620
for each other

744
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,140
just because

745
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,580
they hang out a lot.

746
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,500
Mr. Zhou,

747
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,340
look what they wrote.

748
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,860
Who'd believe they're just friends

749
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,580
without any feelings for each other?

750
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,860
There's nothing between us.

751
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,580
Xiao Han is

752
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,860
the Student Council President,

753
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,380
an Active Party Member Candidate,

754
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,900
and now a City Model Student Candidate.

755
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,500
In the past three years,

756
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,260
we've all witnessed

757
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,620
his character.

758
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,220
Yes,

759
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,660
I believe in Xiao Han.

760
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,700
He might not have ill intentions,

761
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,580
but it doesn't mean

762
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,620
others are as innocent, right?

763
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,780
Guys,

764
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,060
we've seen a lot of examples.

765
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,700
Many promising students

766
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,180
ended up ruined by these people

767
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,540
and these things.

768
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,380
Chen Mo,

769
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:29,860
tell me,

770
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,420
what are you

771
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,460
thinking?

772
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,780
You're always so active.

773
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,660
You don't like studying,

774
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,780
but you're always
messing around with boys.

775
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,060
Students should act like students.

776
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,620
You're not even in Xiao Han's class.

777
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,700
- How could you...
- Lately, we've been

778
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,820
talking to each other.

779
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,580
We talk about life

780
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,220
and studies.

781
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,380
Just like what you see here,

782
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,460
but that's all.

783
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,300
If that's the ill intention
you talked about,

784
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:01,940
Mr. Xiao,

785
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:03,900
then I admit

786
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,820
Chen Mo is more than

787
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,140
just a classmate to me.

788
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,060
Look.

789
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,060
Then I admit

790
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,900
Chen Mo is more than

791
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,460
just a classmate to me.

792
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,300
Xiao Han.

793
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,340
Mr. Zhou.

794
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,380
What do you think about

795
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,580
the school's decision?

796
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,740
Xiao Han,

797
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,260
I've taught you for 3 years
in high school,

798
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,420
and you came from

799
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,460
our middle school.

800
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,420
Many teachers have

801
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,940
known you for seven years.

802
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,660
We all know

803
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,820
your family situation.

804
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,300
Do you know what it means

805
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,260
if you lose the title of Model Student

806
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,260
and 20 extra points?

807
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,300
I know.

808
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:54,940
(Based on the Review
of School Academic Affairs Committee,)

809
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:59,500
(we hereby nominate Zhao Tingting
from Class 1, Grade 12)

810
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:04,060
(as this year's
Shanghai Model Student Candidate.)

811
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,300
How can you be so stupid?

812
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:16,980
Am I?

813
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,460
Aren't you?

814
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,180
I think I'm fine.

815
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,220
Actually,

816
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,780
you didn't have to say it.

817
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,660
I know you wanted to protect me,

818
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:30,900
but

819
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,340
you shouldn't have

820
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,020
sacrificed yourself.

821
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,100
I just spoke from my heart.

822
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,780
Don't worry.

823
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,220
Even without extra points,

824
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,020
I can still go to Jiao Tong University.

825
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,060
What?

826
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,100
You don't believe me?

827
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,380
Oh.

828
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,500
"Meet after school."

829
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:06,780
For what?

830
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,100
You're not just
giving me this cookie, right?

831
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,220
Try it.

832
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,380
A lobster, please.

833
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,420
No problem.

834
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,060
How about a lobster
cooked in three ways?

835
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,100
It sounds good.

836
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,100
They're just kids.

837
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,780
You're overreacting.

838
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,180
No lobsters or crabs, okay?

839
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:09,780
You're back.

840
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,700
- Mom.
- Ka Men.

841
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,180
Mrs. Xiao.

842
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,460
Aiping, listen,

843
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,460
City Model Student

844
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,620
is a big deal.

845
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,740
In the history of our factory,

846
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,540
whose child has ever got this honor?

847
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,620
We must celebrate it.

848
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:24,940
Yes, Aiping.

849
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,380
On Sunday,

850
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,620
I'll bring a cake.

851
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,100
Ice cream cake, okay?

852
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,100
- I love it.
- So fancy.

853
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,100
A cake is good.

854
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,780
Kids love it, right?

855
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,940
Besides, think about it,

856
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,140
Xiao Han

857
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,820
will be so happy

858
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,940
after eating your cake.

859
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:43,780
Stop talking nonsense.

860
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,620
Oh, my dear mom!

861
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,540
What... What's wrong?

862
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,540
Can you come over?

863
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,380
What's the matter?

864
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,500
We're working on Sunday's menu.

865
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,620
- You...
- For God's sake,

866
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,780
just come over.

867
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,220
What are you...?

868
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,780
How is it?

869
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,500
- How many hot dishes?
- Qing...

870
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,340
Ten.

871
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,740
Ten? That's enough.

872
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,100
Let's make some rice wine balls.

873
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,020
It's hot, okay?

874
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,220
- It's good.
- Sure.

875
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,060
Exactly.

876
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,100
Lost the City Model Student title?

877
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,100
Mr. Xiao's number...

878
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:36,940
Well,

879
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,460
I remember I have

880
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,780
Mr. Xiao's number.

881
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,100
It's always like this.

882
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,460
Whenever you want to find something,

883
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,300
you can never find it.

884
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,100
Qiming, stop looking for it.

885
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,380
What's the point of being anxious?

886
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,100
What? Well, listen,

887
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,700
if they bully Han

888
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,540
or Mao Tou,

889
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,780
they're also bullying me.

890
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,620
No way!

891
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,740
Han is so honest, right?

892
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,460
Tingting set him up,

893
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,660
and he just admitted it.

894
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,940
Why did he admit it?

895
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,420
Does she even have proof?

896
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,540
Can she prove it?

897
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,500
20 extra points.

898
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,820
Are you kidding me?

899
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,100
Aiping, listen,
this is how society works.

900
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,060
Eye for an eye, okay?

901
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,180
If we're tolerant,

902
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,180
they'll only get worse!

903
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,780
Can you just calm down?

904
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,780
I need to think, okay?

905
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,660
Okay, okay.

906
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,140
Don't worry.

907
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,060
Don't worry.

908
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,660
Think carefully.

909
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:36,900
He's back.

910
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:59,300
