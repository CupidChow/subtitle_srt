He said he knows.

26
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:42,770
Qian Jiayue.

27
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,950
Good for you.

28
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,840
I thought with your indecisive nature,

29
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,790
you'd wait till you're 30
to tell Xiao Han.

30
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:49,920
- Ka Men.
- Turns out...

31
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,120
You misunderstood.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,040
Brother Xiao Han,

33
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,520
do you know why I work so hard

34
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,300
to get into

35
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,780
No. 2 Middle School?

36
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,820
I know.

37
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,620
You didn't do well
in the Middle School Entrance Exam,

38
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,190
and didn't make it into No. 2 Middle School.

39
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,340
It's really unfortunate.

40
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,180
I can feel it.

41
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,240
You held onto this determination
for four years in middle school.

42
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,420
You wanted to prove
you're not worse than me, right?

43
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,660
No, that's not it.

44
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,140
That's not what I meant.

45
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,220
It's okay, being ambitious is good.

46
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,980
Now you've entered No. 2 Middle School.

47
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,900
In three years, let's see who does better

48
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,260
in the College Entrance Exam.

49
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,380
Brother Xiao Han,

50
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,380
I actually wanted to say...

51
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,780
- I...
- No need to be embarrassed.

52
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,020
That's how learning works.

53
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,300
Healthy competition leads to growth.

54
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,580
Right?

55
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,220
No, that's...

56
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,410
You are both here.

57
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,580
You found it.

58
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,780
Do you like it?

59
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,060
It seems you don't like it much.

60
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,660
No worries,

61
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,620
I have a big gift for you.

62
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,100
Surprise!

63
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,620
What's this?

64
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,780
Open it and see.

65
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,380
My dear General!

66
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,220
You...

67
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,980
Mao Tou!

68
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,980
How could you put a cricket in there?

69
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,500
He gave me a scare!

70
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,460
That's so crazy!

71
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,300
Right?

72
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,300
I really don't know what he was thinking.

73
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,140
His mind is always wandering.

74
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,380
Sister,

75
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,500
I'm talking about you and Xiao Han.

76
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,140
What do you want me to do?

77
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,620
I've already told him,

78
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,320
I entered the No. 2 Middle School for him.

79
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,120
But he thinks I'm competing
with him academically.

80
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,140
Then don't talk about studies with him.

81
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,220
Avoid triggering his competitive side.

82
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,620
Enter his mind,

83
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,620
and handle the rest.

84
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,220
How do I do that?

85
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,940
Aren't you good at folding origami stars?

86
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,490

This isn't just any jar of origami stars.

125
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,540
I've written codes inside it.

126
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,940
Codes?

127
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:47,940
Yes.

128
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,380
There are 520 origami stars in total.

129
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,220
Twenty of them are golden.

130
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,620
The rest are blue.

131
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,300
He just needs to open those twenty

132
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,660
golden origami stars,

133
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,620
and he'll find

134
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,260
on each golden origami star,

135
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,300
I've written a number.

136
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,340
Once he arranged them by number,

137
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,540
he'll discover

138
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,860
it's a song's lyric.

139
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,700
Song lyric?

140
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,900
I first drafted them on paper,

141
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,760
then copied onto them.

142
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,420
Brother Xiao Han is smart,

143
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,780
he'll surely understand,

144
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,620
right?

145
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,260
Stars are not just stars,

146
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,460
there's a code within them.

147
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,300

148
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,740

149
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,380
- Who is it?
- Wait, wait!

150
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,380
It's me.

151
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,820
Quickly, put it in Xiao Han's drawer!

152

157
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,740

I... I... I can't.

160
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,060
I have homework to do.

161
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,540
Brother Xiao Han will watch me.

162
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,060
The dictionary's in my drawer.

163
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:08,900
Grab it yourself.

164
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:10,900
- Don't!
- Don't!

165
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,340
Don't what?

166
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,180
Don't... don't…

167
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,980
Don't be upset.

Mao Tou,

170
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,660
I learned a new song.

171
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:35,980
- No...
- Can you listen for me?

172
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,460
- What?
- Help me out here, okay?

173
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,220
Is Ka Men alright?

174
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,300
She...

175
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,700
She should be okay.

176
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,740
Maybe... Maybe...

177
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,420
She's just excited about the new song.

178
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,660
Brother Xiao Han,

179
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,460
didn't you give me a pen last time?

180
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,660
I've also prepared a gift for you,

181
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,500
as a return gift.

182
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,340
Really?

183
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,020
I put it in your drawer.

184
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,500
There's a little secret inside.

185
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,660
You need to open it and look carefully.

186
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:05,980
Alright.

187
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,740
By the way, Brother Xiao Han,

188
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,330
are you going to the Fuguilou Restaurant?

189
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,180
Of course.

190
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,100
Then see you there.

191
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,060
Ka Men.

192
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:16,900
Coming.

193
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,420
I...

194
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,700
Your "distant travels",

195
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,620
I feel like it's

196
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,860
just a bit melancholic.

197
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,660
But it lacks the feeling of wandering.

198
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,540
I suggest you try experiencing it.

199
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,180
Don't you think

200
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,740
they're acting a bit odd today?

201
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,300
Really odd.

202
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,540
What are you looking for?

203
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,460
Jiayue said she prepared
a return gift for me,

204
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,020
but I can't find it.

205
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,020
A return gift?

206
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,500
Is there one for me too?

207
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,020
Let me check.

208
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,620
Wait.

209
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,140
Did you hear that?

210
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,140
Hear what?

211
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,020
General's chirping.

212
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:00,900
Didn't you hear it?

213
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,580
The sound of General.

214
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:10,860
Got it.

215
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,620
Leave it to me.

216
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,240
When I, Zhang Qiming, handle things,

217
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,860
you can absolutely trust me.

218
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,660
Little imp,

219
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:19,660
move faster.

220
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,620
Are you sewing inside?

221
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,100
Hold the baijiu steady, don't spill it.

222
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,820
The hairstyle

223
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,340
must be neat.

224
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:42,500
(Fuguilou Restaurant)

225
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,340
Wait a moment.

226
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,740
Parking fee is twenty.

227
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,620
That expensive? It's not a train.

228
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,140
Ten.

229
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,580
That won't do.

230
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,900
Just grabbing a bite.

231
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,820
The kid has got into

232
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,300
a prestigious high school.

233
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,150
Impressive, huh?

234
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,420
(Congratulations to Qian Jiayue
for getting into No. 2 Middle School)

235
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,580
Ten yuan.

236
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,940
Come on.

237
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,940
Let's celebrate together.

238
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,420
Ten yuan.

239
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,540
Fine, ten yuan it is.

240
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,660
Give him ten yuan.

241
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,260
I don't have change, only bills.

242
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,340
Here you are.

243
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,620
Sir. Issue an invoice, thank you.

244
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,540
- Hold on.
- Thanks, thanks.

245
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,380
Congratulations to Qian Jiayue

246
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,840
for getting into No. 2 Middle School.

247
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,860
What about you, little imp?

248
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,380
If we can put up a sign
like this next year,

249
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,860
not to mention Fuguilou Restaurant,

250
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,100
I can make the Oriental Pearl

251
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,540
Revolving Restaurant revolve for you.

252
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,220
What's good about No. 2 Middle School?

253
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,140
You really like to boast, don't you?

254
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,940
Focus your cricket fighting energy

255
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:34,900
on studying instead.

256
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,340
If you were

257
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,500
half as good as them,

258
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,620
I'd be very thankful.

259
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:39,940
If you were

260
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,300
half as supportive as their parents,

261
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,380
I'd also be thankful.

262
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,060
Traveling for work
and drinking all the time,

263
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,020
never home.

264
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,380
I feel like an orphan,

265
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,340
relying on others for meals.

266
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,100
Have I left you undisciplined for too long?

267
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:49,940
I'll give you a slap now!

268
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,900
Here's your invoice.

269
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,100
Thank you.

270
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:56,940
Stop playing? Get inside.

271
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,740
Look at you, such a mess.

272
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:12,340
(Congratulations to Jiayue, Wanqing and Han
for getting into No. 2 Middle School)

273
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,180
Director,

274
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,300
would you like some fresh juice?

275
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,140
Sure, sure.

276
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,340
It's very sweet.

277
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,900
Just a little, just a little.

278
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,060
Brother Xiao Han,

279
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,580
did you notice something?

280
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,900
Notice what?

281
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,260
Look at this.

282
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,180
This?

283
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,740
What is it?

284
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:36,670
This

285
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,020
looks like a red date,

286
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,500
but the key

287
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,810
is the glutinous rice inside.

288
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,340
Do you like eating it?

289
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,260
Come,

290
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,220
have some more.

291
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,030
If you want something to eat,

292
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,240
I'll bring it closer to you.

293
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,300
Actually, I wanted to say,

294
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,460
the origami stars I gave you,

295
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,580
have you checked them?

296
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,580
Origami stars?

297
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,340
What origami stars?

298
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,020
Sorry, sorry.

299
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,260
I'm late, I'm late.

300
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,940
For meals, you're never late.

301
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,660
Come on, come on.

302
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,260
You look radiant.

303
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,220
Mr. Zhang, we've been waiting for you.

304
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,090
Did I explain clearly?

305
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,860
- Explain again.
- You're late, three drinks as a penalty!

306
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,020
- Later.
- Yes, yes.

307
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,380
I'll bow to you.

308
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,340
I'm late. Sorry, sorry.

309
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:30,980
Truely sorry.

310
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,300
You look beautiful today.

311
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,860
Three drinks as a penalty!

312
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,660
You're visiting the community yourself.

313
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,980
Enjoying with the people, I see.

314
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,220
Arriving late, you owe us three drinks.

315
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,460
Yes, yes, three drinks as a penalty.

316
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,660
You've lost weight, you look svelt.

317
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,940
You're always so good with words.

318
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,620
Even if I was late today,

319
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,740
I just had to come.

320
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,140
The three kids did so well in their exams.

321
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,180
In the old days, they would've been

322
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,780
called scholars!

323
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,260
Aiming for top gaokao scores
is within reach!

324
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,380
Come on, take it.

325
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,860
No need, Mr. Zhang.

326
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:01,900
Mr. Zhang?

327
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,900
That sounds too formal.

328
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,860
Just call me uncle.

329
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,860
You won't lose anything.

330
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,530
Baby.

331
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,780
Qing, take it.

332
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,700
Just take it.

333
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,620
Thank you.

334
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:11,980
Take it.

335
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,580
Can't give them to you kids, right?

336
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,860
You might spend it carelessly.

337
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,460
I'll give them to the moms.

338
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,420
Come on, take it.

339
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,380
No, no, really, no need.

340
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,380
You must take it.

341
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,860
You must take it, come on.

342
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,540
You must take it. Take it.

343
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,220
- You must take it.
- Thank you, Zhang Qiming.

344
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,740
Thank you, Mr. Zhang. Thank you.

345
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,940
It's my pleasure. My pleasure.

346
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,660
My friends here, please stand up

347
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,030
and move a little bit over there, okay?

348
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:33,940
That's right.

349
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,340
Make room for Mr. Zhang.

350
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,580
Move to another seat.

351
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,340
No other intentions,
just drinking with him.

352
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,540
Waiter, serve the food.

353
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,460
You two, don't drink too much.

354
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,300
We won't.

355
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:43,790
Come on.

356
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,300
Have a smoke.

357
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,780
Everyone's here.

358
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,060
Let me say a few words.

359
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,500
Okay, okay.

360
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,500
Dear old colleagues

361
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,660
and old neighbors,

362
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,940
today's meal

363
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,930
is mainly to

364
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,570
celebrate our New Village's three kids,

365
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,780
Xiao Han,

366
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,300
Liu Wanqing,

367
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,600
and my daughter, Qian Jiayue!

368
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,210
Let's celebrate them

369
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,740
for achieving excellent results

370
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,340
in the High School Entrance Exam,

371
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,700
and entering the city's top school,

372
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,730
- No. 2 Middle School.
- Be careful, it's hot.

373
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,420
- Thanks.
- Cheers, cheers, cheers!

374
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,820
Brother Xiao Han was directly recommended.

375
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,300
Which required even higher abilities.

376
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,500
Jiayue, it's the same.

377
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,300
It's different.

378
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,540
They're all role models for Mao Tou.

379
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,900
They all are.

380
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,620
This little imp is always sloppy.

381
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,940
Have you any educational insights,

382
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,580
do share them with me.

383
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,940
Any insights on education?

384
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,780
Please share them.

385
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,100
I'm not really qualified to give advice.

386
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,820
Yes, me neither.

387
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,580
He asked about my insights.

388
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,030
Go ahead, share yours.

389
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,980
It's mainly because Qian Jiayue

390
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,580
is sensible and self-motivated.

391
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,180
Every morning after she gets up,

392
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,340
she reads that...

393
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,420
"Crazy English", right?

394
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,380
Baby,

395
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,620
can you read it for everyone?

396
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,540
Come on, stand up and read it.

397
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,260
- Come on.
- Let's hear some applause.

398
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,060
I'm going to the restroom.

399
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,420
I really can't stand my mom.

400
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,540
Alright, alright.

401
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,180
You heard that, right?

402
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,590
I mentioned the origami stars,

403
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,340
but Brother Xiao Han seemed unaware.

404
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,140
Do you think he might be

405
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,220
subtly hinting at something?

406
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,540
But judging by his reaction,

407
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,780
could it be he didn't notice at all?

408
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,260
That's impossible.

409
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,060
I did put it in his drawer,

410
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,900
I even told him directly.

411
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,100
Plus, I have another surprise

412
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,260
for everyone.

413
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,420
I'm going to

414
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,100
recite a poem by Qian Jiayue,

415
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,220
one she wrote herself.

416
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,060
Oh, she writes poetry?

417
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,340
Yes, it's in Chinese.

418
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:18,180
Part the dark clouds in the sky.

419
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,460
Nice!

420
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,420
The verb "part" is used well.

421
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,300
Impressive!

422
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:28,060
It's as beautiful as blue velvet.

423
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,460
Crossing

424
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,740
mountains for you.

425
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,500
Ignoring

426
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,100
the scenery.

427
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,540
I

428
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,140
cannot help missing you.

429
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,860
Each thought

430
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,860
brings a new dream.

431
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,340
In her dreams, you see.

432
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,380
So familiar.

433
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,540
- Maybe I've heard it before.
- Yes.

434
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,580
I also feel it's familiar.

435
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,460
Yeah, like I've heard it somewhere.

436
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:56,140
♪Hope you remember♪

437
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:59,700
♪I'll always protect you♪

438
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,060
Now I really can't remember.

439
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,460
What song is this?

440
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,140
"Love Is Only One Word".

441
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,460
That's right!

442
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,860
"Love Is Only One Word"!

443
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,420
It's the lyrics.

444
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,420
Where did you get it from?

445
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,380
Wait, Mao Tou,

446
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,860
where did you get this from?

447
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,240
Sister Jiayue gave it to me.

448
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,460
She left it in my drawer.

449
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,020
Brother Xiao Han told me

450
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,300
it's your return gift.

451
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,500
Thank you, Sister Jiayue.

452
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,220
Xiao Han, Mao Tou...

453
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,540
(Xiao Han)

454
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,940
What about the note?

455
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,060
I read the note.

456
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,140
You said stars are not just stars.

457
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,300
I got it instantly.

458
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,900
You meant to say,

459
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,740
the origami stars inside aren't the key.

460
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,820
The key is this jar.

461
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,100
Right?

462
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,580
And origami stars?

463
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,900
What origami stars?

464
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,500
- Show us.
- Sister Jiayue

465
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,540
lost my cricket the other day.

466
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,870
She felt really bad about it,

467
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:11,720
so she specially

468
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,700
found a jar for me to keep my cricket.

469
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,060
I found it.

470
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,060
Our baby is really thoughtful.

471
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,740
She gave a return gift with a code.

472
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,660
What do these numbers mean?

473
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,820
One, two, three, four, five...

474
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,100
What are you doing?

475
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,940
Will you stop it?

476
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,460
You always rummage through my stuff.

477
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,780
Now you even checked my trash can.

478
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,030
- Trash can?
- Where's it from?

479
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,460
From the trash can?

480
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,660
Well, look...

481
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,660
Thrown in the trash can.

482
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,100
That's just trash, right?

483
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,460
It's just trash.

484
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,700
I can look at it, right?

485
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,740
I just think it's so well-written.

486
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,100
It's a shame to throw it away.

487
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,860
Want to check my stuff, huh?

488
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,260
Alright, I'll show you!

489
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,620
Jiayue. Jiayue...

490
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,500
Peeking at my diary.

491
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,940
And even my trash can!

492
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,780
Now I'm showing you everything!

493
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,860
Jiayue...

494
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,140
You talk about face all the time.

495
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,860
But you keep falling into disgrace

496
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,780
and deceiving others!

497
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,340
You grab every little advantage.

498
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,780
Even it's just two bowls of wontons!

499
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,980
I can't trust you anymore!

500
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,700
Why do I have a mother like you?

501
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,540
Jiayue.

502
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,260
Jiayue. Jiayue!

503
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,500
Don't worry. I'll go.

504
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,740
I'll go, I'll go.

505
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,140
Pei!

506
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,180
Help me here, Pei.

507
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,140
Qian Kang, hurry up!

508
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:54,460
What were you looking at?

509
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,580
Fish?

510
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,300
They're all gone.

511
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,440
I knew you'd be hiding here.

512
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,340
Since you were little,
whenever you're upset,

513
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,540
you'd always come here to hide.

514
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,840
After the Middle School Entrance Exam,

515
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,020
you secretly came here to cry too.

516
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:16,050
Remember that?

517
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,380
Was I really embarrassing just now?

518
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,700
No.

519
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,940
Of course I do.

520
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,860
It's not just me.

521
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,500
My mom was even more embarrassing.

522
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,860
If I were you,

523
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,940
I'd stay away from my family,

524
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,060
especially my mom.

525
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,490
I don't want to stay away from your mom.

526
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,900
I actually respect her a lot.

527
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,090
Even though sometimes she says and does...

528
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,060
Annoying things.

529
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,420
Well, not really annoying,

530
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,820
it's more like

531
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,930
lacking consideration.

532
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:45,780
But...

533
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,060
My new shoes.

534
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,700
They're all from your mom.

535
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,820
I know.

536
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,100
She gets clearance items
others don't want,

537
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,690
and gifts them to you like treasures.

538
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,690
Is there really such a good deal?

539
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,020
Do you really think,

540
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,380
every six months,
there is clearance that fits perfectly?

541
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,840
They're not clearance at all.

542
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,340
These are new shoes.

543
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,620
Your mom bought these new shoes

544
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,540
with her wages.

545
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,500
She does it every six months.

546
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,020
Sis, this pair is the latest model.

547
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,090
The quality is really good.

548
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,860
Look at these soles.

549
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,740
They're very sturdy.

550
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,790
They won't wear out easily.

551
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,140
I'll trust you again this time.

552
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,620
It has to be good quality, Wang.

553
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,820
- No worries.
- Cheaper. Half price?

554
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,140
Half price?

555
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,580
Come on, don't joke around.

556
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,140
- If you don't want them, forget it.
- I'm an old customer.

557
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:36,980
Isn't that right?

558
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,820
Seriously.

559
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,180
Alright, 20% off.

560
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,140
Your mom said that because

561
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,860
she didn't want to hurt my pride.

562
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,340
To protect my and my mom's dignity.

563
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:50,900
So truly,

564
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,620
in my heart,

565
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,900
your mom is a wonderful, kind person.

566
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,620
She's truly a great mom.

567
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,900
Baby?

568
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,940
- Baby!
- Qian Jiayue!

569
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,020
Auntie,

570
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,180
have you seen a girl in a white dress?

571
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,580
- No, I haven't.
- No? Thank you.

572
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,980
Qian Jiayue!

573
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,540
You go this way,

574
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,380
I'll go that way.

575
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,820
Baby!

576
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,500
She's back.

577
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,380
How was it?

578
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,820
Did you find her?

579
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,020
Everyone's gone now.

580
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,420
They've all left.

581
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,380
So much food was left uneaten.

582
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,660
It can be packed.

583
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,700
I'll settle the bill.

584
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,590
- There's a lot going on.
- Where are you going?

585
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,740
I've already paid the bill.

586
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,890
The most important thing now

587
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,180
is to find Jiayue.

588
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,120
I can't find her.

589
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,740
Can't find her.

590
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,700
Come, sit down.

591
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,970
Don't worry.

592
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,020
Let's not rush.

593
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,260
I...

594
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,700
I really have to say.

595
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,260
You were a bit much earlier.

596
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,140
She has grown up, you know?

597
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,460
Time quietly passes.

598
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,500
Everyone has secrets now.

599
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,020
Why dig through the trash

600
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,300
and expose her secrets

601
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,700
in front of everyone?

602
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:17,900
Alright, alright.

603
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,100
Stop crying.

604
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,390
It's a mother and daughter thing,

605
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,380
no grudges overnight.

606
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,660
You all know that

607
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,540
my baby

608
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,860
wasn't raised by me, right?

609
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:32,940
Back then, I was in Jiangxi,
working in the countryside.

610
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,980
We just wanted to

611
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,660
send her to Shanghai early.

612
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:40,340
Shanghai had better living conditions,

613
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,300
- good for the kid.
- Yes.

614
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,620
I would do anything to get her

615
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,820
to Shanghai.

616
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:48,700
I remember the day
I had to return to Jiangxi.

617
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:58,940
Baby,

618
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,220
I promise you,

619
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,100
I will be back next year,

620
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:05,940
okay?

621
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,220
A year goes by quickly.

622
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,700
Xiu'e, time to leave.

623
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:14,980
Baby...

624
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,260
I've regretted it since then.

625
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,020
I've regretted it to this day.

626
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,980
I shouldn't have left her in Shanghai.

627
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,580
I should have raised her myself.

628
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,580
Alright,

629
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,380
stop thinking about this now.

630
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,900
Back then, you didn't know

631
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,180
when you could return to Shanghai.

632
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,460
You just made

633
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,300
the right choice for the kid.

634
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,260
Yes, indeed.

635
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,260
My baby,

636
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,260
let me tell you,

637
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,140
isn't close to me at all.

638
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,420
She's only close to my mom.

639
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,100
She doesn't tell me anything.

640
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,820
I have no other choice.

641
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,340
I just have to search this and that.

642
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,500
I just want to understand her more.

643
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,620
I want to make it up to her, right?

644
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,460
If you

645
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,220
want to be good to the kid,

646
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,020
you should do it
in a way she accepts.

647
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:25,860
Right?

648
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,060
Otherwise,

649
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,860
you'll just push her further away.

650
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,370
True.

651
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,660
Pei, what you said makes sense.

652
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:37,990
Right?

653
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,470
Wait.

654
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,790
My baby said,

655
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,280
I took advantage
even for two bowls of wontons.

656
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,410
You told her that?

657
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:52,980
The thing is...

658
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,420
I was just joking with you.

659
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:59,200
Why do you tell my daughter everything?

660
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,520
I was kidding.

661
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,380
I was kidding too, do you believe me?

662
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,340
(Jiale Wontons)

663
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:10,980
Mom.

664
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,540
Did you find Qian Jiayue?

665
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,100
Not yet, still looking.

666
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:15,940
You're back.

667
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:17,230
Let me tell you,

668
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,900
Chen Xiu'e really

669
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,340
overdid it this time,

670
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,420
she went too far.

671
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,350
What meant to be poetry recitals,

672
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,550
ended up with lyric reading.

673
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,940
So embarrassing!

674
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,460
Exactly.

675
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,160
What kid likes that?

676
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,540
- Yeah.
- I like that.

677
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,860
Qian Jiayue's mom,

678
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,370
doing this and that,

679
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,680
whether it's right or wrong,

680
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,250
it's all out of loving her

681
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,250
and being proud of her.

682
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,740
I also got into No. 2 Middle School.

683
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,640
I feel like no one is proud of me.

684
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,730
She was talking about you.

685
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,300
Never proud of your daughter.

686
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,820
I...

687
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:03,780
(Mao Tou's Home - Idle People Keep Away)

688
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,620
Brother Xiao Han.

689
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,220
I'm out of ink again.

690
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,260
Brother Xiao Han, how's Sister Jiayue?

691
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,300
She's fine now, already back home.

692
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,420
I mean, seriously,

693
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,500
why was she so angry with Godmother?

694
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,220
And I find her quite odd.

695
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,500
If she wanted to give me a jar,
just give it.

696
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,980
Why put so many origami stars inside?

697
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,580
What's the point of that?

698
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,030
And there's a note saying something like,

699
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,180
"Stars are not just stars,

700
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,900
there's a code within them."

701
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:31,390
I don't get it. Maybe she's playing
a guessing game.

702
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:35,900
The origami stars I gave you,
have you checked them?

703
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,960
Actually, I wanted to say,

704
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,180
this

705
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,740
looks like a red date,

706
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,380
but the key is the glutinous rice inside.

707
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,580
Our baby is really thoughtful.

708
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,060
She gave a return gift

709
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,020
with a code.

710
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,260
What do these numbers mean?

711
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,620
One, two, three, four, five...

712
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,300
"Love Is Only One Word".

713
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,500
(A certain column of words in the lyrics)

714
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,500
Brother Xiao Han,

715
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,730
do you know why I work so hard

716
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,580
to get into

717
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:36,980
No. 2 Middle School?

718
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,660
Nice shot!

719
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,950
- You're back.
- Honey, the baby's back?

720
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:51,980
- Don't rush, don't rush.
- Baby...

721
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,820
Wait, wait.

722
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,820
She's inside.

723
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,020
Let her have some time alone.

724
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,180
Baby,

725
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,840
Granny is coming in.

726
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,240
It's okay, don't worry.

727
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:18,050
I made you some pumpkin porridge.

728
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:18,900
Would you like some?

729
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:21,370
It's a bit hot now.

730
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,860
Let it cool down first.

731
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,780
Don't be upset.

732
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,670
Your mom is just like that,

733
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,810
you know it.

734
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,780
She always needs to be
the center of attention.

735
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:39,090
Even when she's wrong,

736
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,250
she never admits it.

737
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,660
Exactly.

738
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,380
But

739
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:46,420
for someone like her,

740
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,900
do you know

741
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,460
what made her truly let go of her pride?

742
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,200
What's the matter?

743
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:58,500
That year, bringing you
from Jiangxi to Shanghai,

744
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,900
she asked me for help.

745
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,130
Your mom

746
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,170
settled in Jiangxi early on.

747
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,290
Life was really tough then.

748
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,020
Then she met your dad.

749
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,610
Maybe your mom thought

750
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:17,080
she couldn't let you suffer with them.

751
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,390
That's why she decided

752
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,300
to send you back to Shanghai.

753
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,180
Twenty years.

754
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,070
Twenty years,

755
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,190
never once did your mom

756
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,060
yield to me.

757
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,420
That afternoon,

758
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,910
she said so many nice things to me.

759
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,520
Her pride,

760
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,010
she completely let go.

761
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:44,890
So Baby,

762
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,120
you

763
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:48,660
can say she doesn't keep promises.

764
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:50,330
You can say she

765
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:51,900
peeks at your diary.

766
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,140
But remember one thing.

767
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,800
You must never say your mom

768
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,660
doesn't care about you.

769
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,780
Got it?

770
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,260
Come.

771
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,020
Hurry up.

772
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,040
Tasty, right?

773
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:03,500
♪Little girl♪

774
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,950
♪You've let your hair grow long♪

775
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:12,310
♪You've loosened the hand
that tightly held mine♪

776
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:17,290
♪No longer do you♪

♪Little girl, don't be afraid♪

779
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,700
One, two, three.

780
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:37,730
Baby, can I come in?

781
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,770
I just want to give you something.

782
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:42,040
I'll leave after I put it down.

783
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,690
I promise I won't bother you, okay?

784
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,740
Okay.

785
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:05,400
Baby, this is for your computer.

786
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,280
What are you doing?

787
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,860
I said I don't need a computer.

788
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,890
I know you're thoughtful.

789
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,800
But,

790
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,500
I've thought it over.

791
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:17,970
It's just that...

792
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,830
For your studies,

793
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,340
I will always support you.

794
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,010
Don't worry,

795
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:25,820
I promise to keep my word this time.

796
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,350
To buy a computer,

797
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,820
it's fine if you don't want me to go.

798
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,060
I won't go, I won't go.

799
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:36,190
I'll call your Aunt Guan, and ask Mao Tou

800
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,470
and Xiao Han to join you, alright?

801
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,380
All the money,

802
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,940
where did you get it from?

803
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,540
About the money,

804
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,550
you don't need to worry.

805
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,960
I have my ways.

806
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,060
If you don't tell me, I won't take it.

807
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,730
Well...

808
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,220
The IOU is ready.

809
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,420
Don't worry.

810
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,340
After my term deposit matures next year,

811
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,500
I'll repay you with interest.

812
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,940
No need to write an IOU.

813
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,140
That money

814
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:30,660
is from Baby's two uncles.

815
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,640
Take the computer as a gift from them.

816
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,300
That's not right.

817
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,980
Even brothers settle accounts clearly.

818
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,180
Let's keep things separate.

819
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,750
I'll buy my daughter's computer myself.

820
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,420
(Term Deposit Receipt: Fifteen Thousand Yuan)
This

821
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,420
is a deposit.

822
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,600
But don't worry,

823
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:48,640
I have money.

824
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:50,220
I have it in the bank.

825
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,140
When it matures, I'll withdraw it.

826
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,100
I'll repay your granny with interest.

827
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,580
Also,

828
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,220
I reflected on myself.

829
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,260
Regarding last time,

830
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,500
it was my fault.

831
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,740
I shouldn't have gone through your things.

832
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,780
I promise you this.

833
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,780
In the future, without your permission,

834
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,500
I'll never enter your room.

835
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,740
Even if I come to clean,

836
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,620
I won't go through your things.

837
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,220
Is that okay?

838
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,060
So,

839
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,940
can you forgive me?

840
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,180
Also, I

841
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,180
shouldn't have snapped at you

842
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,620
in front of them.

843
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,420
Sorry.

844
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:54,940
Well...

845
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,290
Baby, keep the money safe.

846
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,980
I'll head out now.

847
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,220
Okay, I'm leaving.

848
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,020
I'm off.

849
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,420
Baby, one more thing.

850
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,570
About this money,

851
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:11,900
make sure you keep it well.

852
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,580
Anyway, you three kids,

853
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:16,220
be careful out there.

854
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,680
I'll stop talking. I'm leaving now.

855
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,200
Mom.

856
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,840
Come with us.

857
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,140
You don't want me there.

858
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,380
I think I'll pass.

859
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,620
If I go,

860
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:33,180
I'm afraid I'll start bargaining again,

861
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,180
and embarrass you.

862
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,260
If you keep insisting,

863
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,740
then I really won't let you come.

864
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:40,860
I'll stop.

865
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,740
I would come with.

866
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:42,780
I'm coming along.

867
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,220
Sister.

868
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,260
We bought it.

869
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,740
Pei, we bought the computer.

870
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:51,130
Mom.

871
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:52,660
Stop shouting.

872
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,030
No shouting, no shouting.

873
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,540
Uncle Wang.

874
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,820
The computer's here.

875
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,110
Come over later.

876
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,420
Come and see.

877
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,020
It's nothing, it's nothing.

878
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,080
(Home Computer Monitor)
Xiao Han, be careful with plugging.

879
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:06,380
- Make room for Mao Tou.
- The plug can become loose.

880
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,060
Mao Tou, don't throw the box.

881
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:08,980
Help me throw this out.

882
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,290
- Toss the plastic.
- Okay, okay.

883
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,380
Baby, the thing's on the glass.

884
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,220
Is it going to scratch it?

885
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,180
Let's go, let's go.

886
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:16,500
I'll get a screen cleaner for you.

887
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:17,500
Oh, let me see!

888
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,660
Alright.

889
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,660
It's almost done.

890
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,580
Mao Tou will install some software later.

891
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:28,660
Jiayue.

892
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,100
Well...

893
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:35,020
I have something to tell you.

894
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,500
What is it?

895
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:51,420
Those origami stars,

896
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:52,790
I've seen them all.

897
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,790
And I saw what you wrote.

898
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,420
I want to say,

899
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,030
I'm really happy that
you got into No. 2 Middle School.

900
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:06,010
Really.

901
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,100
I'm happy too.

902
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,300
I'm really happy for you.

903
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,020
This high school phase

904
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,660
is very important for us.

905
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,420
In three years,
we'll take the College Entrance Exam.

906
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,780
That's our current priority.

907
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:19,820
So,

908
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,700
let's focus together

909
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,180
on our studies.

910
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,340
What do you think?

911
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,140
I mean,

912
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,940
three years pass quickly.

913
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,060
Some things

914
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,420
don't need to be rushed.

915
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,700
Agree?

916
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,020
I agree.

917
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,180
You

918
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,100
really understand me?

919
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:50,860
I understand.

920
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:51,860
Brother Xiao Han,

921
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,820
rest assured.

922
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,030
I will definitely do my best.

923
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,420
Good.

924
00:38:58,490 --> 00:38:59,360
I'll head back now.

925
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,020
I made it clear, right?

926
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,860
Together...

927
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,460
A three-year promise.

928
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:23,740
Let's promise,

929
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,300
in three years,

930
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:27,420
we'll have a new start.

931
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,700
Brother Xiao Han.

932
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,580
I'll definitely do my best.

933
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,460
Where were you?

934
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:45,820
Hurry, come here!

935
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,380
I've installed the Office software.

936
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,220
Take a look at this.

937
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,460
OICQ.

938
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,300
You can add others.

939
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,140
Then chat with them.

940
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:55,450
Since neither of you
knows who the other is,

941
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,140
it doesn't matter what you say.

942
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,180
Also,

943
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,820
I've prepared a surprise for you.

944
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:04,660
What kind of surprise?

945
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,300
Remember the diary I gave you?

946
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:14,300
After you finish writing,

947
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:16,940
open this cover,

948
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,970
then place your diary

949
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,220
inside.

950
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,630
It fits perfectly.

951
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,020
Then put the cover back.

952
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:28,730
Impressive, Mao Tou!

953
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,780
I guarantee Godmother

954
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,540
won't find out.

955
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:59,180
(Our Story)

956
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:07,500
(Our Story)

957
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:24,140
(See you in college)

958
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:29,260
(End of Episode 2)

959
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,940
To celebrate that

960
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:44,730
my daughter got into No. 2 Middle School,

961
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:48,600
everything today is 5% off.

962
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,100
Great!

963
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,520
Well, my daughter

964
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,590
is sitting at Table Two,

965
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,560
with a bow on her head.

966
00:41:58,730 --> 00:41:59,880
Beside her is

967
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:02,430
a copy of Modern Music Field magazine.

968
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:04,740
She entered No. 2 Middle School!

969
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,000
I watched her grow up...

970
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,740
I think I remember now.

971
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,660
That day, the boss told me...

972
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,140
Honey,

973
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,060
now I know

974
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,580
why our baby copied

975
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,740
"Love Is Only One Word".

976
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,060
That's a song from Lotus Lantern.

977
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,180
That film

978
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:25,220
is about Chen Xiang saving his mother.

979
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:28,030
So she wants to talk about maternal love!

980
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:28,940
Really?

981
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,420
Absolutely.

982
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,420
It really is.

983
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:32,580
I was too obtuse.

984
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,860
I just remembered now.

985
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:35,460
Baby was talking about maternal love.

986
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,460
- Love Is Only One Word.
- Come on.

987
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,660
Get in. I'll drive you to work.

988
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,660
No need, honey. I'll take the No. 9 Bus.

989
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,320
Come on, get in. It's just a quick drive.

990
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,020
Honey, good luck with earning money.

991
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:46,020
Drive safe.
