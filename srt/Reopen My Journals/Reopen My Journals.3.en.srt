00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,390
Hey, girl.

191
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,120
Could you help us pick up the ball?

192
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,510
You're trying too hard.

193
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,390
Pick it up over there.

194
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,000
This girl is quite unique.

195
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,320
It's you!

196
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,200
The girl who threw up.

197
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,650
Thank you for that.

198
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,320
I'm Qian Jiayue.

199
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,360
Qian Jiayue?

200
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,290
You two know each other?

201
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,030
We're sanitary pad friends.

202
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,750
Keep it down.

203
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,840
Okay, okay.

204
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,670
I forgot my sanitary pads,

205
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,120
and Qian Jiayue bought a pack for me.

206
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,750
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

207
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,510
Are you the one
who made her lose the pen?

208
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,550
What pen?

209
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,270
Qian Jiayue left the pen on the sink

210
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,510
after helping you.

211
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,910
After the exam, it was gone.

212
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,360
Sorry about that.

213
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,480
I'll buy you a new one.

214
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,550
No need, really.

215
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,000
That's her lucky pen.

216
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,840
It's special to her.

217
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,150
Have we met before?

218
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,150
Is your name Ka Men?

219
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,550
I'm Chen Mo!

220
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,630
Summer Language Camp, Grade 8.

221
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,200
Chen Mo isn't silent at all.
[*Chen Mo: Silent]

222
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,840
Ka Men really got stuck.
[*Ka Men: Stuck]

223
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,360
I remembered it!

224
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,630
I remember you were in Nanshi District.

225
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,150
Why are you at No. 2 Middle School now?

226
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,480
My dad changed his job.

227
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,510
We just moved here.

228
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:21,150
By the way, are there
any fun places around?

229
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,150
Xidian Mall.

230
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,480
Restaurants, beverage shops,

231
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,320
photo sticker booths,

232
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,450
movie theaters, game rooms,

233
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,600
stationery shops,

234
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,550
and gift shops.

235
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,440
The music store has got new CDs.

236
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,550
I want to buy Coco Lee's
new English album.

237
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,630
I want Kelly Chen's new album.

238
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You like Kelly Chen?

239
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,840
I especially love her song Notebook.

240
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,600
I prefer her Cantonese songs.

241
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,390
I think her new release
is a Cantonese album.

242
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,320
I like her song
There Is Only You in My Heart.

243
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,940
That's Priscilla Chan's song.

244
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,200
Let's go to Xidian Mall.

245
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,440
No, I can't.

246
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,510
I promised Qian Jiayue

247
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,030
to teach her to ride a Bicycle.

248
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,200
Let's take a quick tour
and come back early.

249
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,190
We'll teach her together.

250
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,320
Is that okay, Jiayue?

251
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,790
Of course.

252
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,320
But my stomach...

253
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,840
is still not feeling well.

254
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,390
Why don't you go first?

255
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,600
I'll get some stomach pills.

256
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,480
When you finish,

257
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,550
you can teach me.

258
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,720
No problem, let's go.

259
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,560
Okay.

260
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,140
(Yingmo Community)
Hey, don't drop it.

261
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,240
Don't worry.

262
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,680
Mao Tou.

263
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,230
Godmother.

264
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,230
What are you doing?

265
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,720
You're playing with gangsters.

266
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,670
They're not gangsters.

267
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,320
They're helping me move in.

268
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,440
Mao Tou.

269
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,120
- Your dad beat you?
- We'll have fun.

270
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,400
Well, are you in?

271
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,150
You two go in first.

272
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,670
- Move them inside.
- Sure, okay.

273
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,080
Godmother.

274
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,170
I've completely cut ties

275
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,020
with Zhang Qiming.

276
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,990
No turning back.

277
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,150
Don't be so extreme.

278
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,420
You can't get rid of him, right?

279
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,630
I'll scold him, okay?

280
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,480
I'll scold Little San.

281
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,600
Stop it, Godmother. I don't care.

282
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,600
Anyway, I've moved back.

283
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,440
It's okay, Godmother.

284
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,840
It's okay.

285
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,000
Hey, Mao Tou.

286
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,220
(Jiale Wontons)

287
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,630
Zhang Qiming is way out of line.

288
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,960
He's always out drinking

289
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,790
for business.

290
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,670
He's son eats
at other people's houses.

291
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,710
He doesn't care,

292
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,630
and when he cares,

293
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,680
he beats his son.

294
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,040
Unbelievable.

295
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,550
They're both

296
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,510
stubborn.

297
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,480
It's always a mess.

298
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,390
Mao Tou is so miserable.

299
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,480
His grandparents passed away,

300
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,080
and his father is like this.

301
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,630
If only his mom

302
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,480
Yang Min were still here.

303
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,790
Why did you bring her up?

304
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,440
She said she was going to Japan, and asked

305
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,750
Zhang Qiming to borrow money.

306
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,150
He ended up heavily in debt.

307
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,180
Well,

308
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,030
in the end, she stayed in Japan

309
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,240
and won't come back.

310
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,670
It's like she has no family here.

311
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,630
What's so good

312
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,030
about Japan?

313
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,440
I wouldn't go for money.

314
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,960
- Yes.
- Ridiculous.

315
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,960
Would you like some soda?

316
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,000
Sure.

317
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,030
I'll have the yellow one.

318
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,440
Pei.

319
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,480
Fangfang!

320
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,360
Yesterday, I was wondering

321
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,200
when you'd come again.

322
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,960
Have some soda.

323
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,800
I just opened it.

324
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,030
Thank you.

325
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,150
You're welcome.

326
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,270
Same as usual,

327
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,750
120 wontons.

328
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,790
Sure, no problem.

329
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,960
Have a seat.

330
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,800
Okay, okay.

331
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,230
Aiping.

332
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,320
Fangfang.

333
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,630
Who is she?

334
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,670
Pei's old neighbor.

335
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,000
They grew up together.

336
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,510
Here you are.

337
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,840
120 wontons.

338
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,360
Here, 12.5 yuan, right?

339
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,480
If you don't have small changes,
just don't pay.

340
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,630
I do. I've prepared some.

341
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,600
- Look at this.
- You're too polite.

342
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,030
Here, take this.

343
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,020
I'll get some plums for you.

344
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,600
No need, really.

345
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,870
You're too kind.

346
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,030
I wanted to tell you last time

347
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,200
that your hair looks fantastic.

348
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,000
The big curls are so chic.

349
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,080
Much better than

350
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,000
the noodle curls.

351
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,030
Where did you get it done?

352
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,030
There's a new hair salon

353
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,550
next to our hospital.

354
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,150
The stylist returned from Japan.

355
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,910
Japanese techniques!

356
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,550
No wonder it's so great.

357
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,080
I got a membership card.
Let's go together next time.

358
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,920
Definitely.

359
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,790
Alright, I need to go.

360
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,890
- Bye.
- I'll walk you out.

361
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,390
Fangfang,

362
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,670
come by more often.

363
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,000
It's much more convenient now.

364
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,200
Just cross the street.

365
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,670
It's good to have some soda

366
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,360
and chat with me, right?

367
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,210
I will.
I didn't even expect to see you today.

368
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,200
- Alright.
- Goodbye.

369
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,960
- Bye.
- Take care, bye.

370
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,480
She's gone.

371
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,150
You're laughing so much

372
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,150
that you can't close your mouth.

373
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,390
So happy.

374
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,750
Why shouldn't I be happy?

375
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,630
I haven't seen her for a long time.

376
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,790
When I was young,

377
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,790
I wanted to go to the nursing school
with Fangfang.

378
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,600
Unfortunately, my dad didn't agree.

379
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,840
He assigned me to No. 9 Factory.

380
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,390
Is it that bad

381
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,640
to join our No. 9 Factory?

382
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,480
If I had gone to the nursing school,

383
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,200
I should be working in a hospital,

384
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,040
right?

385
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,320
I would've had a stable and decent job

386
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,440
instead of selling wontons
after being fired.

387
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,720
If you were a nurse,

388
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,600
your dramatic perfume

389
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,150
would make the patients even sicker.

390
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,550
- You...
- Fangfang is not a nurse.

391
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,510
She works in the pharmacy.

392
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,840
I think they just moved
to Jinxiu Garden.

393
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,840
They bought a house.

394
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,000
Bought a house?

395
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,270
Her husband is so rich.

396
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,480
Her husband is an executive

397
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,870
of a state-owned enterprise.

398
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,390
He earns a lot,

399
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,440
and his company provides
a car and a driver.

400
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,680
I've seen the driver before.

401
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,480
He looks more handsome
than Qian Kang.

402
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,910
He wears a suit and tie every day

403
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:01,820
with white gloves.

404
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:05,320
A driver in a suit and tie
with white gloves,

405
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,790
how rare!

406
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,840
He's their driver.

407
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,120
He's her husband's driver

408
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,910
not your husband's driver.

409
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,240
Why are you so proud?

410
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,600
I'm not proud, okay?

411
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,840
I just want to introduce...

412
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,000
I don't want to know her.

413
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,440
Why did you introduce her?

414
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,270
Why are you so ridiculous?

415
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,360
What's wrong with you?

416
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,540
(Yingmo Community)

417
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,150
Granny.

418
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,510
Granny.

419
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,240
Did Ka Men come?

420
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,440
Who?

421
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,340
Ka Men.

422
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,550
No.

423
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,040
Hurry, get up.

424
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,100
Let's have dinner.

425
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,080
Okay.

426
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,000
Hello.

427
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,830
Granny, it's Ka Men.

428
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:10,790
Okay, hold on a second.

429
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,800
Jiayue.

430
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,120
It's Qing.

431
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:20,380
I got it. Granny, you can hang up.

432
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,590
Hello.

433
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:24,070
Hello, Qian Jiayue.

434
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,350
Are you feeling better?

435
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:26,840
I'm much better now.

436
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,550
Did you just get back?

437
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,590
Yes.

438
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,640
Chen Mo and I

439
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,070
completely lost track of time.

440
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,550
I didn't realize it was dark
until I came out.

441
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,400
Chen Mo really gets me.

442
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,000
She recommended so many artists

443
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,960
I've never even heard of.

444
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,400
I've spent all my allowance

445
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,440
of this month.

446
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,820
Come to my place tomorrow.

447
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,000
I'll show you what I bought.

448
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,920
Then I'll teach you to ride bike.

449
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,080
Sure.

450
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,830
See you tomorrow.

451
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,200
See you tomorrow.

452
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,750
The music store

453
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,920
has got new CDs.

454
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,400
I wanted to buy

455
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,590
Coco Lee's new English album.

456
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:10,550
Really?

457
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,030
I want Kelly Chen's new album.

458
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,660
(Coco Lee's English Album)

459
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,940
(Tracklist)

460
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,860

Girl, Look Over Here, by Richie Jen)

462

(When by Power Station,
Butterly in the Rain by Linda Lee)

463
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,960
Kelly Chen...

464
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,550
Fake Innocence,
Can't Help Falling in Love...

465
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,080
Chen Mo!

466
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,310
- Ka Men!
- I'm here!

467
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,390
Qian Jiayue!

468
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,220
Jiayue, what a coincidence!

469
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,000
You arrived at the same time.

470
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,880
Qian Jiayue,

471
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,200
are you feeling better now?

472
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,590
Much better.

473
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,430
That's great.

474
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,350
Ka Men, I brought you some cookies.

475
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,400
Thank you.

476
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,960
I really love it!

477
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,200
Let's go inside!

478
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,440
Go upstairs.

479
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,980
(Jiale Wontons)

480
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,590
This is my room.

481
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,040
Not bad.

482
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,720
So many Jeff Chang posters.

483
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,070
Yeah, I have more.

484
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,920
There are more posters

485
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,040
in Qian Jiayue's secret base.

486
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,080
Secret base?

487
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,160
It's where Qian Jiayue
and her friends

488
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,590
have played together since childhood.

489
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,760
I also go there sometimes.

490
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,240
Take me there next time.

491
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,080
Sure.

492
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,890
Please have a seat.

493
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,960
I'll grab some drinks.

494
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,640
You get photo stickers?

495
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,550
Yes, do they look good?

496
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,520
Take a look.

497
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,560
They're great.

498
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:53,100
We also went to Tianma Music Store,

499
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,200
and Madam Bookstore,

500
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,030
and we had
the sausage and milk tea combo.

501
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,400
Ka Men told me it was your secret route.

502
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,400
Yes.

503
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,020
Did you buy Kelly Chen's new album?

504
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,620
The duet Cantonese song...

505
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,920
No, we got this one.

506
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,640
This is...?

507
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,400
- Westlife!
- Westlife!

508
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,920
They're really popular.

509
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,240
- Here.
- Thanks.

510
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,000
Let me see.

511
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,880
I haven't organized
these photo stickers.

512
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,750
They look amazing.

513
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,790
- The best one!
- So good.

514
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,200
I also think it's the best one.

515
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,200
You like it too, right?

516
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,030
Yes, because we both look great.

517
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,640
We can frame it.

518
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,480
Yes.

519
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,640
As for the smaller ones,

520
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,480
I'll stick them here.

521
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:35,240
And place them over there.

522
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,750
What's this?

523
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,080
Let's open it.

524
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,480
This is my Rukawa Kaede!

525
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,880
You bought the same thing?

526
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,190
What?

527
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,510
That little ball.

528
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,480
Let me show you.

529
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,750
Chen Mo bought it.

530
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,790
Then she gave me the only red one.

531
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,000
Red is good. It suits you better.

532
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,200
Lively and vibrant.

533
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,830
I prefer the red one.

534
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,720
You should've bought

535
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,350
the Rukawa posters yesterday.

536
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:07,160
Don't worry. I asked the owner
to save them for me.

537
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:09,420
I'll buy them next month
when I get my allowance.

538
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:10,590
Let's go together next time.

539
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,480
Sure.

540
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,960
What should we do later?

541
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,200
Let's go to my place.

542
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,400
My parents aren't home.

543
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,920
I'll show you my collection.

544
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,270
I need to teach Qian Jiayue
to ride a bicycle.

545
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,750
She can practice in our neighborhood.

546
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,550
That's right.

547
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,750
Let's go to Chen Mo's place first,

548
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,550
and we can practice bicycle.

549
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:33,270
Besides, Chen Mo's bicycle
is high-end and light.

550
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,790
It's easier to handle.

551
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,440
There are fewer people in Jinxiu Garden.

552
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,800
No, thanks.

553
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,200
It occurs to me that I have

554
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,920
something to do this afternoon.

555
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,680
You're always busy
when I ask you to hang out.

556
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,480
Granny asked me to buy something.

557
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,520
Granny?

558
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,160
Your dad's mother?

559
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,880
No, my mom's mother.

560
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,840
Your mom's mother?

561
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,850
Her granny thinks

562
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,030
"grandma" is not

563
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:00,890
close enough,

564
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:01,750
so it's Granny.

565
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,870
I think how you call someone

566
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,400
doesn't define how close you are.

567
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,790
I agree.

568
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,550
Which one do you like?

569
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,640
I like this one.

570
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:11,630
Then it's yours.

571
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,720
Really?

572
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,440
Then come to my place later.

573
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,000
You can show me your card.

574
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,110
Sure.

575
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,880
This one.

576
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:31,910
Sir.

577
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,190
You're here.

578
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,400
Did Ka Men ask you to save

579
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,640
two photos of Rukawa yesterday?

580
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,480
Yes, they're still here.

581
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,920
Then I'll buy them.

582
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,080
Okay.

583
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,910
These two.

584
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,960
She sings so well.

585
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,280
Mrs. Liu.

586
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,480
- Jiayue.
- Mr. Liu.

587
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,320
Jiayue.

588
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,310
Is Ka Men home?

589
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,480
Yes, just got back.

590
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,240
Qing!

591
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,000
Jiayue is here again!

592
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,400
Ka Men!

593
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,240
Qian Jiayue, you're right on time.

594
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,720
Come here. I'll show you something.

595
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:19,630
What is it?

596
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,920
You'll find out.

597
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,380
My Jeff Chang!

598
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:28,900
Did you see it?

599
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,160
Autograph!

600
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,420
(Jeff Chang)
His autograph!

601
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,200
I'm so excited!

602
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,200
Oh my god, an autographed poster!

603
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,830
Where did you get it?

604
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,790
Chen Mo gave it to me.

605
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:44,290
I saw it in her room.

606
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:45,960
I stared at it, and she said,

607
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,400
"It's yours".

608
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,510
Just like that, she gave it to me.

609
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,330
Chen Mo is so nice.

610
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,320
By the way,

611
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,550
did you need something?

612
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,070
Nothing.

613
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,200
I just want to talk to you.

614
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,310
It hurts.

615
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,120
- Baby, you're back. Wash your hands.
- Can't walk.

616
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,690
Still hurt?

617
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,830
I'll get you some warm water, okay?

618
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,270
How could Zhang Qiming

619
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,960
beat him this hard?

620
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,270
Mao Tou, don't worry.

621
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,650
I'll teach Little San

622
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,160
a lesson later.

623
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,720
How dare he?

624
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,480
But, Mao Tou,

625
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:47,270
you young folks shouldn't do this.

626
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,160
You can't run away from home every time,

627
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,240
understand?

628
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,440
Run away?

629
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,590
What are you doing?

630
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,680
I've figured it out.

631
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,800
From now on,

632
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:02,000
I'll live in the old house.

633
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,270
Anyway, my grandpa left it to me.

634
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,030
I want to leave Old Zhang!

635
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,350
Ridiculous.

636
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:11,530
What about food?

637
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,400
Where will you eat?

638
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,030
Stop it!

639
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,720
I've always eaten here,

640
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,750
haven't I?

641
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,800
God Grandma.

642
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,240
Godmother.

643
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,750
You're my only family now.

644
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,640
You won't abandon me, right?

645
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,680
Of course not.

646
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,880
No way.

647
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,070
We won't let you starve.

648
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,000
Sister Jiayue.

649
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,040
What's wrong?

650
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,640
I don't have any money now.

651
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,480
My pockets are as empty as my face.

652
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:52,720
Can you

653
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,480
return the allowance

654
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,960
you took from me?

655
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,310
No way.

656
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,240
I've given it back to your dad.

657
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,070
Stop pretending to be pitiful.

658
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,270
Just go home.

659
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,340
Well, Qian Jiayue,

660
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,550
you only care about
your new friend now, right?

661
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:11,550
Listen,

662
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,510
old clothes fit better than new ones.

663
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,480
What new friend?

664
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,680
Brother Xiao Han said

665
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:19,100
a beautiful girl went to your school,

666
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,480
and he saw you having fun

667
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,480
with her and Sister Ka Men.

668
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,630
Chen Mo?

669
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,270
Does Brother Xiao Han know her?

670
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:31,000
Yes, his senior in the basketball team
told him.

671
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,790
He said all the boys at your school

672
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:33,960
know about Chen Mo.

673
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,680
Chen Mo...

674
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:38,750
Chen Mo...

675
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,400
Look at you.

676
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,640
Why are you arguing
because of such a small thing?

677
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,730
Don't want to talk to you.

678
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,040
Xiu'e.

679
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:48,130
I heard

680
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,640
Fangfang's daughter
also got into No. 2 Middle School.

681
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,480
Maybe these kids

682
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,680
will be

683
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,000
classmates.

684
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,190
Pei.

685
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,270
What's the name of Fangfang's daughter?

686
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:01,400
Chen Mo. Her dad named her.

687
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:03,240
- He said silence...
- Is golden.

688
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,800
Baby.

689
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,720
Do they live in Jinxiu Garden?

690
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,550
Her mom works at

691
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,680
a pharmacy.

692
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,470
How do you know?

693
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,240
Why should I care about
where she lives?

694
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:24,310
We're not close.

695
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:27,550
Godmother, does she also
live in Jinxiu Garden?

696
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:30,830
Then I'll have
a beautiful neighbor, right?

697
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,800
Yes.

698
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,720
Why would you run away from home?

699
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,590
Go home and find the beautiful neighbor.

700
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,240
Sister Jiayue.

701
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,110
Did I say something wrong?

702
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,160
I'm just asking.

703
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,240
Right?

704
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,390
Yes.

705
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,320
That's right.

706
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,960
She has a pretty face,

707
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,030
a wealthy family,

708
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,920
and a house in Jinxiu Garden.

709
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,350
Their drivers

710
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,480
even wear white gloves.

711
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,440
Fancy neighborhood.

712
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,110
Our family

713
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,070
can never compare to them.

714
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,390
Move, move.

715
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,590
But listen,

716
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:14,400
one should never forget
where they come from.

717
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,750
Even though
you live in Jinxiu Garden now,

718
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,880
you are originally from
Workers' New Village,

719
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,400
right?

720
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,750
When you're in trouble,
you need to come back.

721
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,720
What's so special about that?

722
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,400
She puts on so much perfume

723
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,160
that I can even smell it
across the street.

724
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,240
Why would she do that?

725
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,550
I also have perfume,

726
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,030
but I never put it on.

727
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,070
Never. What's the point?

728
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,870
What's wrong with her?

729
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:13,790
Go away.

730
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,270
Do you want Figs?

731
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,960
I... I heard that

732
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,400
Chen Mo is very

733
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:31,790
arrogant, hard to deal with,

734
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,630
and attractive...

735
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,800
No.

736
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,830
I mean... She knows she's pretty,

737
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,960
so she looks down on the seniors

738
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,030
in the basketball team.

739
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,550
They said they'd teach her a lesson

740
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,400
when school starts.

741
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,790
Sister Jiayue, you're different.

742
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,790
You're gentle and generous.

743
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,200
You've got great hair

744
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,750
and good clothing taste.

745
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:56,790
You have big eyes...

746
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,030
Enough.

747
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,440
Do you know
how much a gold nib pen costs?

748
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,480
Gold nib?

749
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,550
More than 100 yuan.

750
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,200
More than 100 yuan?

751
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,960
Well, do you want to buy it?

Brother Xiao Han

753
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,350
gave you one, didn't he?

754
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,040
Lost it?

755
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:24,920
No wonder you're upset.

756
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,030
None of your business.

757
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,920
Go home after dinner.

758
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,920
Stop running away from home.

759
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,160
What's the point of doing this?

760
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,440
Godmother, I'm hungry.

00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:50,180
(Shanghai Puyang No. 2 Middle School)

762
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,350
Qian Jiayue, Ka Men!

763
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,750
We're in the same class! Look!

764
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,350
- Which class?
- Class 5, Grade 10.

765
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,440
- Sorry.
- Look!

766
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,310
(Class 5, Grade 10)

767
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,150
Do you see it?

768
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,370
That's great!

769
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,030
Wait a moment!

770
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,160
- Who else?
- Excuse me!

771
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,120
Excuse me!

772
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,820
(Class 1, Grade 10, Xiao Han)

773
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,400
Okay, stop looking. Let's go.

774
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,590
Come on. Let's go.

775
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:16,290
It's okay.
You didn't get in the key class,

776
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:18,270
but at least we're still
in the same class.

777
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,110
It must be stressful
to be in the key class.

778
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,960
We're classmates. Isn't it great?

779
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,350
Oh, I've got something for you.

780
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,790
I lost your pen last time.

781
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:27,790
I'm really sorry.

782
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,750
Though it's as good as your lucky pen,

783
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:30,920
I really hope you like it.

784
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:32,950
This...

785
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,510
Isn't this the pen

786
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,800
your dad bought in Hong Kong, China?

787
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,000
Just take it.

788
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,400
No need, really.

789
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:40,870
Last time,

790
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,350
I lost it because I was careless.

791
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,430
It's not your fault.

792
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,880
No, you must accept it.

793
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,000
If you don't, I'll be offended.

794
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,560
Let's go.

795
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:50,580
(Welcome, Freshmen of 1999)

796
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,550
It feels so smooth.

797
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:04,590
Right? Excellent needlework.

798
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,200
Yes, it's very thin

799
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,400
and smooth.

800
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,640
I remember your mom knitted well.

801
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,590
I didn't know you were as good as her.

802
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,550
Pei.

803
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,480
Xiu'e, you're here.

804
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,270
Auntie.

805
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,440
Well, look who's here.

806
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,750
It's Chen Xiu'e.

807
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:29,680
Haven't seen you in two days.

808
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,350
You have special guests.

809
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,750
I don't want to bother you.

810
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,440
I should know my place,

811
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,280
right?

812
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,190
What's the matter?

813
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,720
What do you need?

814
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,960
One kilogram of flour.

815
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,520
Wait.

816
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,440
Xiu'e, we're leaving.

817
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,280
We need to cook.

818
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,200
Be safe.

819
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,070
See you next time.

820
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:15,640
Nowadays, we

821
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:18,160
buy clothes from stores.

822
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,440
Do rich people knit sweaters?

823
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,640
Don't make fun of me.

824
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,850
I'm just passing the time.

825
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:27,680
I knitted a cardigan
for my daughter.

826
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,030
Nowadays, kids

827
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:30,750
don't want to wear handmade clothes.

828
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,000
It's their choice not to wear it,

829
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,080
but a mother

830
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,270
still wants to do it.

831
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,110
Don't you think so?

832
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,320
Take it.

833
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,240
Two yuan.

834
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,200
What are you doing?

835
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,400
Take it back.

836
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,800
Chen Xiu...

837
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,850
Chen Xiu'e!

838
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:58,480
- What?
- You're so annoying!

839
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,070
Want to steal coins?

840
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:46,070
No, it fell on the ground.

841
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:46,910
I just picked it up.

842
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,200
Here you go.

843
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,070
Bro, your combo is pretty good.

844
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:56,590
If you add a Ghost Step to that move,
you can do

845
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,030
an endless Ghost Step combo.

846
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,630
Like this. You made that move

847
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,110
and threw a light punch, right?

848
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:03,070
If you add a heavy punch

849
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,110
and a heavy kick,

850
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,030
you can deal maximum damage.

851
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:07,950
Wait a minute.

852
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,760
Insert a coin. I want a battle.

853
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,800
Have you seen him
lose three times in a round?

854
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:22,910
No.

855
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,000
This brat has really got something.

856
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:30,520
Get him a bottle of cola.

857
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,430
Okay.

858
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,350
Hey kid,

859
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,670
are you coming

860
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,160
this afternoon?

861
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,400
This afternoon? I'm not sure.

862
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,030
4 p.m.,

863
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,280
right here,

864
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:49,480
let's play some money games.

865
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,760
Do you dare?

866
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,160
Of course.

867
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:57,390
Okay.

868
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,600
Bro,

869
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,720
he's here.

870
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,760
Sit down.

871
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,280
- It's him?
- Yes.

872
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:13,030
Come on, insert the coin.

873
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,550
Come on.

874
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,320
We'll be rich, bro.

875
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,670
Come on, one more time.

876
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,240
Not bad.

877
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,920
Impressive, bro.

878
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,590
Well, want to surrender?

879
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,840
Fine, you won.

880
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:08,280
- Bye.
- Wait.

881
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,640
What's wrong?

882
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,920
100 yuan per round, as we agreed.

883
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,400
100 yuan per round?

884
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:16,550
How's that possible?

885
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,840
Are you new here?

886
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,070
Do you know the rules?

887
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,070
How many rounds?

888
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,630
He lost 12 rounds in total.

889
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,800
I remember how each round went.

890
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:29,150
You can't leave
until you pay off the debt.

891
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,030
This is all I have.

892
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,760
I didn't bring money.

893
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,280
What?

894
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:44,960
Okay, okay.

895
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,000
I surrender. Here.

896
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,190
I'll pawn my pager to you.

897
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,030
Okay?

898
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,030
I don't have money.

899
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,000
I need to get it.

900
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,280
It's important to me.

901
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,230
I'll surely come back.

902
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,070
Okay?

903
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,030
Impressive.

904
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:05,350
Wait a minute.

905
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,550
Play a bit longer.

906
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,680
Please.

907
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,630
Next one, hurry up!

908
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,760
It's him.

909
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,030
- These guys, tight?
- Yes.

910
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,150
Police! Run, Bro!

911
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,030
Stop! Don't run!

912
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:27,910
Follow them!

913
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,110
Hey, they ran away.

914
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,430
Don't move!

915
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,680
Yes, he's one of them.

916
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,480
The Police Station called,

917
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:43,400
but I didn't know what happened, right?

918
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,030
I couldn't find Zhang Qiming.

919
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:47,190
Do you remember his cell phone number?

920
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:49,400
I remember. We'll call him
from the police station.

921
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,240
Okay.

922
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:57,990
Listen,

923
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,000
if this continues,

924
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:01,630
he'll be over.

925
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,800
In the past,
he only made trouble in school,

926
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,280
but now he's in the police station.

927
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,190
Maybe next time,

928
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,240
he'll be in jail.

929
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,510
That's impossible, Mr. Jiang.

930
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:10,400
Actually, he's

931
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,920
(Shanghai Puyang Police Station)
a good boy.

932
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,280
He's still young and ignorant.

933
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,320
He was just influenced by bad buys.

934
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:18,590
Mr. Jiang, please teach him well and

935
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,710
correct his mistakes.

936
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:22,010
Of course I'll teach him.

937
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,360
But you need to understand.

938
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,390
Not every student

939
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,440
can be taught well in school.

940
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:29,400
Shouldn't their parents
be more responsible?

941
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,200
You don't need

942
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:33,060
to worry about

943
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,440
the good students.

944
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:36,030
As teachers, you should

945
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,320
focus on the students

946
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,800
who really need help, right?

947
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,400
Wait, why are you teaching me?

948
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:42,070
I wasn't taken to the police station.

949
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,080
He's out.

950
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,190
Did you find Zhang Qiming?

951
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,280
The call went through,

952
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,370
but Huanghe Road Police Station took it.

953
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,840
They said he got drunk

954
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,800
and fell asleep in a roadside flowerbed.

955
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,740
Two detectives found him,

956
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:55,780
and he's still

957
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,720
sleeping at the police station.

958
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,030
Mr. Jiang,

959
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:00,710
thank you so much.

960
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:01,990
It's okay.

961
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,230
- Thanks.
- It's getting late.

962
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,550
- I need to go.
- Goodbye.

963
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:05,590
See you at school.

964
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,760
Goodbye, see you around.

965
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,760
Goodbye.

966
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,880
Mao Tou, stay away

967
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,110
from those gangsters.

968
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,320
Keep your distance.

969
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,480
Understand?

970
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,110
Don't go to the arcade again.

971
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,880
It's okay to play games,

972
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,320
but no gambles or blackmailing.

973
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,550
I didn't blackmail him.

974
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:28,920
Still arguing?

975
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,840
The officer said you took money too.

976
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:31,960
Exactly.

977
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,450
If you didn't take the money,

978
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:35,080
you would've just been used.

979
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:37,400
But you took it,
and it makes you an accomplice.

980
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,590
It's completely different.

981
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:42,070
Didn't your dad give you money?

982
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,550
Why do you need so much money?

983
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,280
I just want to...

984
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,800
Did you lose it?

985
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:51,990
None of your business.

986
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,480
What do you want?

987
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:11,950
Nothing.

988
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,480
Godmother, Mrs. Xiao,

989
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:17,280
please don't tell my dad
about this, okay?

990
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,710
And Sister Jiayue.

991
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:20,430
Got it.

992
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,480
Well, it's late.

993
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,070
We'll take you home.

994
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,800
Didn't the officer say

995
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,800
my dad was sobering up
at the police station?

996
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,880
Don't worry.

997
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,630
We'll pick him up later.

998
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,480
I'll go with you.

999
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,110
I picked him up once when he was drunk,

1000
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:37,280
and he would act crazy.

1001
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,640
I don't want you to get hurt.

1002
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:40,440
Besides, he's too heavy
for you to carry.

1003
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,280
Let's go.

1004
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,420
(Jinxiu Garden)

1005
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,550
Mao Tou, help him clean his face.

1006
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:24,920
Zhang Qiming, Zhang Qiming,

1007
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,480
you should be grateful

1008
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,880
that you have a good son.

1009
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,760
Mao Tou, where should I put

1010
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,600
the dirty clothes?

1011
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,720
- On the balcony,
- Over there.

1012
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,560
okay?

1013
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,280
They really stink.
