00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,290
You've won four times in a row.

25
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,320
- Impressive.
- Amazing.

26
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,720
Boss,

27
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,130
you're really a game master now.

28
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,780
You beat the three of us
with two computers.

29
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,020
You can be a professional player.

30
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,060
Of course.

31
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,060
Don't forget who I am.

32
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,700
Want my autograph?

33
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,260
It will be valuable.

34
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,380
- No doubt.
- Pen.

35
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,220
Get a pen.

36
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,300
Notebook, notebook!

37
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,700
Who'd bring a notebook here?

38
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,020
Chang Wuji?

39
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,260
What brings you here?

40
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,240
Play Starcraft with you.

41
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,260
Play...

42
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,180
I can't believe you came.

43
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,820
Wait, can you play this?

44
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,300
Not really.

45
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,710
I've just practiced for a week.

46
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,740
I can only play Zerg.

47
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,540
Just a week, he only knows Zerg.

48
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,560
Just a week?

49
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,270
Then I advise you not to play with me.

50
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,140
I'm afraid you'll lose
your champion title

51
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,380
and can't sleep

52
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,700
at night.

53
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,140
I can play 1V7,

54
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,140
insane mode.

55
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,260
1V7?

56
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,620
Insane mode?

57
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,530
He's bragging.

58
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,860
You must be bragging.

59
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,860
1V7?

60
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,220
I didn't know

61
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,460
you were a game genius.

62
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,580
No matter how many computers
you can beat,

63
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,300
I'm different.

64
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,680
After all, humans and computers

65
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,280
are completely different.

66
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,020
Qian Jiayue told me

67
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,700
if you lose,

68
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,740
you'll study hard.

69
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,700
If you lose,

70
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,460
stay away from Qian Jiayue,

71
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,900
as far as possible.

72
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,670
- Wow.
- That move.

73
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,520
- I couldn't see clearly.
- Exactly.

74
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,700
Wiped them out with one move.

75
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,420
It was so fast.

76
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,420
Really impressive.

77
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,540
He upgraded his tech well too.

78
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,460
Yes.

79
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,700
You're new to this game,

80
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,020
so I... I just wanted to

81
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,540
test your ability.

82
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,580
But...

83
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,100
in professional matches,

84
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,520
it's best two out of three.

85
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:15,940
Yes, yes.

86
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,330
It's just the first round.

87
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,780
Alright.

88
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:20,780
No problem.

89
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,140
Come on.

90
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,380
Come on, relax.

91
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,620
Zergling can be used like this?

92
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,860
Have you learned this technique?

93
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,500
Never seen it before.

94
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,400
(You failed to achieve victory!)

95
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,260
This...

96
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,850
He ended it so quickly.

97
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,300
I didn't expect that.

98
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,120
Look here.

99
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,020
Well,

100
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,940
maybe I should go?

101
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,340
Or you want

102
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,740
to play a few more rounds?

103
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,340
No need.

104
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,020
Alright.

105
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:44,900
Then,

106
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,940
I hope you

107
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,460
keep your promise.

108
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,460
Study hard.

109
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,780
Wait.

110
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,860
You...

111
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,380
You said

112
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,180
you only played for a week?

113
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:01,860
Yes.

114
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,700
Well,

115
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,700
how did you practice?

116
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,180
I played against the computer

117
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,820
and watched some pro-player videos.

118
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,820
I think this Zergling strategy

119
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,740
can handle 90% of the matches.

120
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,500
The remaining 10%

121
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,580
are tougher to handle.

122
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,380
Luckily, you're in that 90%.

123
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,180
What is he saying?

124
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,020
You...

125
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,940
Why do I feel like,

126
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,700
the aura around Boss,

127
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,620
that strong vibe,

128
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,500
is all gone?

129
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,700
For a professional player,

130
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,380
that vibe is crucial.

131
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,020
Now...

132
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,340
Boss...

133
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,420
Chang Wuji.

134
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,420
Chang Wuji!

135
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,740
What are you here for?

136
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,110
To play Starcraft with you.

137
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,820
No, I mean,

138
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,860
why are you helping Qian Jiayue?

139
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,060
She's been asking for help lately.

140
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,180
Since she needs it,

141
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,420
I'll find a way to help her.

142
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,820
Even if you beat me,

143
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,820
it won't prove you're strong.

144
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,740
After all, I'm just a beginner.

145
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,500
But if you can't even

146
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,620
beat me,

147
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,820
it means you're not pro-level.

148
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,140
This is a true statement.

149
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,380
What true or false statement?

150
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,420
What are you talking about?

151
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,620
If we use a contrapositive statement,

152
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,460
it means

153
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,740
if you have the skill to go pro,

154
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,700
you'll definitely beat me,

155
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,100
because

156
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,300
the contrapositive of

157
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,500
a true statement is also true.

158
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,180
I don't understand.

159
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,260
Anyway, you're saying

160
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,580
I'm a novice,

161
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,700
and you can easily crush me.

162
00:07:59,140 --> 00:07:59,980
First,

163
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,500
you're not a complete rookie.

164
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,060
Among 90% of average players,

165
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,740
you're among the better ones.

166
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,500
Second, I didn't just beat you casually.

167
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,180
In the past two weeks,

168
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,260
I've spent five hours daily every day

169
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,860
and 14 hours on weekends

170
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,700
studying how to play this game.

171
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,140
In total,

172
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,140
it's over 55 hours a week.

173
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,380
I don't quite understand

174
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,260
why you chose gaming.

175
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,620
In professional competitions,

176
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,010
being in the top 1%

177
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,180
is far from enough.

178
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,500
You need to be in the top 0.1%

179
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,820
and even the top 0.01%.

180
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,100
Even the best in Putuo District

181
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,380
might not achieve much

182
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,380
in professional gaming.

183
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,900
You're from Puyang Middle School.

184
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,900
Every year,
at least 50 students get into

185
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,860
No. 2 Middle School.

186
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,140
Statistically speaking,

187
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,220
it's much easier than professional gaming.

188
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,980
Are you kidding me?

189
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,260
Top 50?

190
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,100
No way. I can't even imagine.

191
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,220
I've been working hard for a month,

192
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,220
and I've only improved

193
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,380
a little.

194
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,660
I'm not cut out for studying.

195
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,140
I never joke with anyone.

196
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,780
You just said

197
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,380
you worked hard for a month.

198
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,540
Okay, let me ask you.

199
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,380
In this month,

200
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,540
how much time did you spend

201
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,380
on studying?

202
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,260
At least 55 hours a week?

203
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,540
You are always a naughty boy.

204
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,460
"Are" is a be verb.

205
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,300
Do you understand?

206
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,380
Once you've spent

207
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,500
55 hours a week,

208
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,260
let's see if you're cut out for this.

209
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,260
Why did you drink so much?

210
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,620
Come on, wipe it off.

211
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,460
Rinse your mouth.

212
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,780
Dad, let's go back.

213
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,260
I can't leave No. 9 Factory's pen here.

214
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,340
You got the pen back.

215
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,020
Come on.

216
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,100
Slow down, slow down.

217
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,740
When you speak,

218
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,380
remember...

219
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,900
What's this mess?

220
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,740
Little rascal.

221
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,020
How do you write "rascal"?

222
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,460
That's inappropriate, right?

223
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,380
Let's have

224
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,660
a men's talk.

225
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,740
My dear son...

226
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,500
It's too mushy.

227
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,140
It gives me goosebumps.

228
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:07,980
Hello, Mao Tou,

229
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,900
I'm writing to you

230
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:11,980
because

231
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,020
maybe I'm

232
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,620
as desperate

233
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,740
as you.

234
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,140
Because right now,

235
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,500
I want to achieve something.

236
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,860
I've asked many people,

237
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,620
drunk a lot,

238
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,260
and searched for many ways.

239
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,980
Although it seems

240
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,500
the chances of success are slim,

241
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,140
I'm willing to

242
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,620
go all out for this.

243
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:41,820
Recently,

244
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,400
you worked so hard

245
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,380
for No. 2 Middle School.

246
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,780
Now, you're convinced

247
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,780
that you can be a professional player.

248
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,340
Will you come up

249
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,260
with another idea next time?

250
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,380
As your father,

251
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,460
I hope you study hard.

252
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,500
Only in that way

253
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,620
can you endure fewer hardships.

254
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,020
(Zhang Qiming, No Entry)
But Aiping said

255
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:09,780
those tough days

256
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,500
when I was hustling around

257
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,780
and living like a lost soul

258
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,140
in Guangzhou, Shenzhen,

259
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,500
and Wuhan,

260
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,140
are vibrant and full of brightness

261
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,900
in her eyes,

262
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,900
because I was running hard

263
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,100
on my chosen path.

264
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,740
So, my son,

265
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:35,620
whether it's No. 2 Middle School or games,

266
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,500
choose what you want,

267
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,260
do what you wish,

268
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,780
and become who you want to be.

269
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,260
As long as you're on the right path,

270
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,260
healthy and happy,

271
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,980
I'll support you.

272
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,380
These are my heartfelt words.

273
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,620
"Heartfeel words"...

274
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,680
I...

275
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,740
Mao Tou,

276
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,980
I really want to hug you.

277
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,100
You're too tired.

278
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,740
Just remember,

279
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,700
I,

280
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,620
Aunt Aiping,

281
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,500
Brother Han,

282
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,620
we all love you.

283
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:07,860
We'll always love you.

284
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,340
Oh, no.

285
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,340
I got

286
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,540
goosebumps again.

287
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,620
Feel it yourself.

288
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,180
Son,

289
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,070
keep going.

290
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,260
Leave no regrets

291
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,860
in this life.

292
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,580
Your dad.

293
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,500
What's going on?

294
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,460
Cheesy Dad,

295
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,860
don't worry.

296
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,980
I'll get into No. 2 Middle School myself.

297
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,380
When will your latest issue

298
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,500
be released?

299
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,380
I can't wait to see it.

300
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,340
Chang Wuji.

301
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,460
Thank you.

302
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,020
Mao Tou told me everything.

303
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,500
You've done so much

304
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,820
and spent so much time

305
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,980
for him.

306
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,580
You're welcome.

307
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,020
I just gave it a try.

308
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,940
So how is he doing now?

309
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,580
That kid...

310
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,260
Maybe he's

311
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,020
starting to study.

312
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:17,940
Who knows?

313
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,340
But no matter what,

314
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,940
I still have to thank you.

315
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,500
Don't be so polite.

316
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,340
Qian Jiayue.

317
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,180
This is for you.

318
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,900
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

319
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,900
(Striving)

320
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,480
It's published! Yes!

321
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,340
Where is it?

322
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,300

Hi, Sailor.

327
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,900
I just want to tell you

328
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,260
the article you advised on

329
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,500
got published.

330
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,580
Thank you.

331
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,540
I feel really lucky

332
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,260
to have got advice

333
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,300
from such a mature editor.

334
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,540
So,

335
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,580
thanks again.

336
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,420
You're welcome.

337
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,540
Lately,

338
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,780
I've been quite busy.

339
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,460
I won't be online for now.

342
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,700
I'm back.

343
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,220
Should I leave the light on

344
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,180
or turn it off?

345
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:27,940
Leave it on.

346
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,940
It's late.

347
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,260
Rest early.

348
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:34,900
Okay.

349
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,540
Your legs must be numb.

350
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,380
Come on, relax.

351
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,620
Relax.

352
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,620
Alright.

353
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,980
Go to bed early.

356

I'll handle it. Leave it there.

358
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,060
you have a new employee.

359
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,020
Yes, that's right.

360
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,180
This new employee

361
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,260
comes every day.

362
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,180
- I don't even need to pay!
- It's for Ms. Huang.

363
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,660
That's amazing, right?

364
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,500
Ms. Huang.

365
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,740
- Let me do it.
- Thanks.

366
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,100
- The new employee
- Be careful.

367
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,740
comes quite often.

369
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,100
Why have you been

370
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,260
keeping an eye on Aiping?

371
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,300
Aiping,

372
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,660
do you have a new admirer?

373
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,540
It's not because of me.

374
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,020
Mao Tou is about to have mock exams.

375
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,900
He's finally taking it seriously.

376
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,020
He wants to come home early for his son,

377
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,820
but Mao Tou finds him annoying,

378
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,700
so he stays here for now

379
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,100
and waits until dinner to go home.

380
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,260
Zhang Qiming,

381
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,640
about what happened last time,

382
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,370
I haven't had the chance to explain.

00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,740
has a bad temper.

385
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,840
Don't take it seriously.

386
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,140
Oh, no.

387
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,260
I think Chen is great.

388
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,500
First, he's disciplined.

389
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,740
Second, he follows the rules.

390
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,940
That's respectable.

391
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,140
It's okay.

392
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,100
But Momo

393
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,420
got into No. 2 Middle School by herself.

394
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,260
Her foundation is quite good.

395
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,240
She's just a bit playful.

396
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,340
Before the exam,

397
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,180
I found several tutors for her.

398
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,260
Do you need the teaching materials?

399
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,660
No, no need.

400
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,900
I've figured it out.

401
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,740
If this little imp wants to learn,

402
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,780
he'll find a way

403
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,020
to study well, right?

404
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,100
If not,

405
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,260
even Mozi, Mencius,

406
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,100
and Confucius

407
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:51,940
can't persuade him.

408
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,260
I just need to support him.

409
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,100
He's on his own.

410
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,220
Zhang Qiming,

411
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,340
since you got Aiping,

412
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,580
your level of education...

413
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,050
I didn't teach that.

414
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,980
- Led by the Red Flag Bearer,
- No need to teach.

415
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:04,820
- right?
- Exactly.

416
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,820
He's changed a lot.

417
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,100
Zhang Qiming is truly a great dad,

418
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,740
much better than Chen.

419
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,900
What's wrong with Chen?

420
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,500
He's so annoying.

421
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,900
It's Sunday,

422
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,820
and he can finally spend time
with his daughter.

423
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,220
My daughter is doing math homework,

424
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,060
but he insists on making her

425
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,780
memorize those essays

426
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,340
about Mozi, Confucius, and Xunzi.

427
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,500
Then it's chaos at home.

428
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,500
I can't even stay at home anymore.

429
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,020
Well, is every man...?

430
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,740
I'm not talking about you, Qiming.

431
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,220
It's okay to criticize me.

432
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,780
Qian, these are

433
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,740
the English materials

434
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,980
from my university days.

435
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:43,920
I'm giving them to you.

436
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,780
(Document)
Thanks a lot.

437
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:46,940
University?

438
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,820
I definitely won't understand

439
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,820
these materials.

440
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,300
I barely finished middle school.

441
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,020
Nothing is impossible,

442
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,740
as long as you're willing to try.

443
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:55,980
You can ask questions.

444
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,020
You can always ask me.

445
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,460
For our generation,

446
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,460
we endured a lot of hardships.

447
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,980
Every single one of us

448
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,180
has been persistent

449
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,580
and comes this far step by step.

450
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,620
Yes.

451
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,500
Nowadays, the kids

452
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,220
always lack self-discipline.

453
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,740
Take my daughter as an example.

454
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,180
She feels like she was born

455
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,500
with the right

456
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,020
to enjoy such a good life.

457
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,320
She doesn't want to endure any hardship.

458
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,740
It's not just that.

459
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,340
Studying hard

460
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,260
and reading books

461
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,220
is like a life-threatening task to her.

462
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,170
What kind of people will they become

463
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,100
when they grow up?

464
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,940
Will they make contributions?

465
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:35,860
Are they trustworthy?

466
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,180
Can they lead the future?

467
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,180
Mr. Chen,

468
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,900
you have a daughter,

469
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,180
and so do I.

470
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,060
How old is your daughter?

471
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,740
Grade 10.

472
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,900
What a coincidence!

473
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,140
My daughter is also in Grade 10.

474
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,220
They should get to know each other.

475
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,900
(Jiale Wontons)

476
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,980
Let's get started.

477
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,580
First, Chang Wuji, congratulations on

478
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,580
winning the second prize
in Shanghai Olympiad.

479
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,340
It's nothing.

480
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,740
My result is still far from

481
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,740
Mr. Zhou's expectations.

482
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,500
Wasn't this your first competition?

483
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,820
I just want to know

484
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,220
what you felt during the match.

485
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:11,780
What did I feel?

486
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,550
For example,

487
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,700
you told Mao Tou

488
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,260
to study 55 hours a week.

489
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,580
I think that's really good.

490
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,740
So, I want to...

491
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,740
sincerely thank you.

492
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,700
Qian Jiayue will interview you in a few days.

493
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,300
No matter what she asks,

494
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,420
you'll thank her.

495
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,020
Keep thanking her

496
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,460
and find the right time

497
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,940
to give her the chocolate.

498
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,180
I've always had a weak stomach.

499
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,420
You always remember it

500
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,780
and treat me to meals.

501
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,180
So,

502
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,700
thank you, Qian Jiayue.

503
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,300
You're welcome.

504
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,700
So, what do you think of

505
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,740
the competition?

506
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,460
Competition?

507
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,460
Well,

508
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,500
competition...

509
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,500
I have something for you,

510
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,900
Qian Jiayue.

511
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,020
I heard this is delicious.

512
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,260
Chang Wuji.

513
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,500
Wait a minute.

514
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,140
What's going on?

515
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,020
Nothing.

516
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,740
I just think this...

517
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,660
Do you prefer

518
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,180
hanging with the three of us

519
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,940
or being alone

520
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,820
with Qian Jiayue?

521
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,460
I haven't thought about it.

522
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,740
- I...
- Hey, don't be mad.

523
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,580
Listen to me.

524
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,540
Here's the thing.

525
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,500
I think

526
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,500
Chang Wuji is pretty good.

527
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,060
Ka Men!

528
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,940
You know I see him as a friend.

529
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,180
Just a friend, understand?
Don't do this!

530
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,020
Are you

531
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,300
talking about me?

532
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,020
Well,

533
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,580
she knows everything now.

534
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,580
It's okay, Ka Men.

535
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,260
I already have an answer.

536
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,320
I...

537
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,900
want to be with you all.

538
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,100
I knew it.

539
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:35,220
Chang Wuji,

540
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,500
we're in the same class.

541
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,660
We're friends and classmates.

542
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,020
Ka Men loves to gossip.

543
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,500
Don't listen to her nonsense.

544
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,180
Can I still go to school

545
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,500
with you?

546
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,180
Of course.

547
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,900
We'll go to school together.

548
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,660
Well, this time,

549
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,180
it's my fault.

550
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,020
Let's forget about it.

551
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,780
I'm not good at basketball.

552
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,820
Liu Jianfeng injured his foot.

553
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,580
We can't gather enough people.

554
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,740
Look.

555
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,980
Lu Yao, you need team spirit.

556
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,260
Liu Jianfeng can't play now,

557
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,780
so everyone thinks we can't win.

558
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,100
We can't quit

559
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,740
the basketball league, right?

560
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,820
Chen Mo, you're back just in time.

561
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:20,970
Sports Committee Member,

562
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,030
I'll leave it to you.

563
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,300
Basketball league?

564
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,740
Class leader,

565
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,300
even you can't find a player.

566
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,740
How can I do it?

567
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,120
If Lu Yao doesn't want to go,
don't force him.

568
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,540
Maybe we can skip the first game

569
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,220
- and wait for Liu Jianfeng.
- We...

570
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,540
Fine.

571
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,180
I'll tell Xiao Han about it.

572
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,420
Wait a moment.

573
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,020
Is our first match against Class 1?

574
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,340
Yes.

575
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,540
Lu Yao.

576
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,500
Aren't you one of us?

577
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,020
Of course.

578
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,100
Can you really watch our class

579
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,580
surrender without a fight?

580
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,740
Dear classmates,

581
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,100
as the Sports Committee Member,

582
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,900
I am now officially forming

583
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,220
a men's basketball team.

584
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,260
Who wants to sign up?

585
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,340
Wait, Chen Mo.

586
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,540
Liu Jianfeng sprained his ankle.

587
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,100
He's still in the hospital now.

588
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,500
Besides Liu Jianfeng,

589
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,460
we have other guys in our class.

590
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,580
Zhao Ru.

591
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,180
I can't play basketball.

592
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,020
Zhu.

593
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,100
I can be a cheerleader.

594
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,740
Classmates,

595
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,180
Class 1, the key class,

596
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,740
is always arrogant.

597
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,500
Now we finally have a chance

598
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,980
to hit them back.

599
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,260
How can you give up so easily?

600
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,300
Chen Mo, what's wrong with you?

601
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,740
I declare,

602
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,340
if we beat Class 1,

603
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,940
I'll treat everyone to KFC.

604
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:56,860
Great!

605
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,100
Okay.

606
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,780
Keep it up!

607
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,540
(Class 1, Class 5)

608
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,010
- Come on!
- Quick, quick!

609
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:22,840
Class 5, let's cheer.

610
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,150
(Class 5, Crush Class 1)
3, 2, 1!

611
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:27,660
Class 5, crush Class 1!

612
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,780
Class 5, crush Class 1!

613
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:34,020
Class 5, crush Class 1!

614
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,740
Boring people do boring things.

615
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,740
It won't grant them extra points.

616
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,900
Why are they so excited?

617
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:40,900
Exactly.

618
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,780
Go Class 1! Go Class 1!

619
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,300
Go Xiao Han!

620
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,980
Go Xiao Han!

621
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:48,900
Lu Yao!

622
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,920
Lu Yao!

623
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:06,460
Class 5, crush Class 1!

624
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,780
Foul!

625
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,020
It's a foul!

626
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:28,860
No foul!

627
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,180
Xiao Han committed a foul.

628
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,340
Two free throws.

629
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,020
Somehow Chen Mo wanted

630
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,420
- Lu Yao!
- to treat us to meals.

631
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,980
I love you!

632
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,900
We'll always support you!

633
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,220
Let me win.

634
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,340
I want to have KFC.

635
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,940
You won't win anyway.

636
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,060
Lu Yao, Lu Yao!

637
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,060
Lu Yao, I love you!

638
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,220
We will always support you!

639
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,740
Lu Yao, Lu Yao!

640
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,300
(Class 1, Class 5)
I love you!

641
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,940
We will always support you!

642
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,740
Lu Yao!

643
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,020
Go Lu Yao!

644
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,260
Go Xiao Han!

645
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,580
Go Class 1!

646
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,580
Louder! Go Class 1!

647
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,100
Go Class One!

648
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,300
Go Lu Yao!

649
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,260
Block Xiao Han!

650
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,500
Stop him!

651
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:53,570
Xiao Han, there's no time!

652
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,300
Lu Yao!

653
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,060
Game over.

654
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,180
Great!

655
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:26,740
- See a doctor?
- Are you okay?

656
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,580
I'm fine.

657
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,060
Don't you know your strength?

658
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:29,900
Just a nosebleed

659
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,900
caused by the scratch.

660
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,740
Wipe it off.

661
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,940
- See a doctor...
- It's okay.

662
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,780
Clean it up.

663
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:41,940
Congratulations.

664
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,540
Your wish came true.

665
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,100
It's fine.

666
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,140
It's okay.

667
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,140
It's fine. Just a nosebleed.

668
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:53,000
Let's go.

669
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:59,840
KFC, KFC, KFC!

670
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,700
I think today,

671
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,100
80 percent of the credit

672
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,300
goes to Chen Mo.

673
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:05,500
Do you know why?

674
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,260
Because the slogan was brilliant.

675
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,580
Everyone got inspired.

676
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,740
Everyone was so excited.

677
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,740
- Yes.
- Right?

678
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,700
I didn't expect Lu Yao

679
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,820
to perform so well.

680
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,580
That final-winning shot.

681
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,700
Xiao Han was shocked.

682
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,040
He felt discouraged.

683
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,880
He was...

684
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:31,900
I didn't get to play.

685
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,540
If I did, we'd score

686
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,900
100 to 0 in the first round.

687
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,640
You shouldn't say that.

688
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,940
- You go first.
- Why?

689
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,060
I forgot something.

690
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,900
- I'll be right back.
- Okay, go.

691
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,020
- We'll wait for you.
- Bye.

692
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,500
Lu Yao, you were amazing.

693
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,660
(To Loner Xiao)

694
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,660
Sorry.

695
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,820
You came so quickly.

696
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,300
I was just nearby

697
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,700
and came right after your message.

698
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,380
- Home?
- Go home.

699
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:01,320
Alright.

700
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,180
Let's go.

701
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,380
Your English has improved.

702
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,260
Mr. Chen,

703
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,500
I've listened to the tapes

704
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,780
(English Materials)
every day.

705
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,100
The early bird catches the worm.

706
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,340
It's right to work hard.

707
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,660
I'm not saying you're slow.

708
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,500
Please don't mind.

709
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,500
Yeah.

710
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,620
It's okay.

711
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,380
Mr. Chen, I have great news.

712
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,540
I got the Five-Star Driver certificate.
Look.

713
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,640
(Five-Star Driver)
Really.

714
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,380
Congratulations, Qian.

715
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,060
Mr. Chen, I should thank you

716
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,300
for helping me.

717
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,620
Don't be so polite.

718
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,900
- Call me Chen.
- Yes, yes.

719
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,100
"Chen" feels more friendly.

720
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,380
We do have a good connection.

721
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,420
I have friends in Jinxiu Garden.

722
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,380
My wife and daughter

723
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,500
have good friends

724
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,700
who live in Jinxiu Garden.

725
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:45,900
Is that so?

726
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,620
Then you'll have a friend
living there too.

727
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,660
Me.

728
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,620
Qian.

729
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,140
When you're free, take your family

730
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,100
to my place.

731
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,100
My wife and daughter

732
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,620
should meet

733
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,580
more hard-working people like you.

734
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,060
Oh, you're too kind.

735
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,500
I'm not that hard-working.

736
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,500
It's my pleasure.

737
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,860
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

738
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,820
No, Chen.

739
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,440
(Jiale Wontons)
Is the tape ready?

740
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,180
I brought my...

741
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:14,780
Check Mao Tou's question.

742
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,900
Is the formula incorrect?

743
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,620
This question...

744
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:21,120
- Mao Tou did it.
- Chen Mo.

745
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,140
They're helping Mao Tou
with his High School

746
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:30,980
Entrance Exam.

747
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,700
Why tutor here?

748
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,860
Because I...

749
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,180
Chen Mo.

750
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:43,900
Which part?

751
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,020
This part. How should I solve this?

752
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,940
Let me see.

753
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,340
If you need anything, just call me.

754
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,460
We're going upstairs.

755
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,500
Okay.

756
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,380
This isn't right.

757
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,380
Aunt Huang, I'm heading up.

758
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,340
Remember the formula?

759
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:58,860
I don't remember.

(Year 2000, Great Heat)

761
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:16,690
What are you doing?

Chinese, 98 points.

763
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,820
98 points.

764
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,500
It's cool.

765
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:27,780

766
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,420
89 points.

767
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:32,860
English...

768
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:35,860
How's your English?

769
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,140
How's the score?

770
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:58,900
Mao Tou.

771
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,380
Mao Tou.

772
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,820
It's alright.

773
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,780
Well, the score...

774
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:12,110
I think

775
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,340
perhaps I can

776
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,300
get in.

777
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,380
I'm 8 points higher than the threshold.

778
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,220
Did I pass?

779
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,820
- You passed.
- I passed.

780
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,820
You passed!

781
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,180
- I passed!
- Passed!

782
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,500
I passed!

783
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:33,940
- I got in!
- No. 2 Middle School!

784
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:36,020
Dad, I got in!

785
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,020
Mao Tou got into No. 2 Middle School!

786
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,900
Little imp, you're amazing.

787
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,140
You got in!

788
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:51,900
Mao Tou got into No. 2 Middle School!

789
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:55,140
Dad,

790
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,340
Mom,

791
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:00,980
your grandson

792
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,660
got into No. 2 Middle School.

793
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,500
I wasn't a good kid.

794
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,020
I got in!

795
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,140
Dad, I got in!

796
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,780
- Qiming!
- Dad!

797
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,500
I got in!

798
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,140
- I heard you!
- I got in!

799
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,660
- The building is shaking!
- I got in!

800
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,500
Han!

801
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,020
You helped him a lot!

802
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,140
What do you want? Tell me!

803
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,620
I need to think it over.

804
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:27,820
Alright.

805
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:28,940
In my lifetime,

806
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,820
I'll grant you three wishes.

807
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,100
As long as I'm alive,
I'll keep my promise.

808
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:33,940
It's a deal.

809
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,700
What kind of wishes can I make?

810
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,660
Anything you want.

811
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,300
- You promise?
- Promise.

812
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,460
I need to think about it too.

813
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:41,660
Think carefully.

814
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,620
What about me?

815
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,900
Oriental Pearl Revolving Restaurant

816
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,300
will revolve for you, okay?

817
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,180
Revolve!

818
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:49,860
Revolve!

I'm going to No. 2 Middle School,

824
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,460
will you be as happy as you are now?

825
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,420
You?

826
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,020
Why do you suddenly want to

827
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:15,980
go to our school?

828
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,420

I'll tell you something.

831
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:27,860
What is it?

832
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,820
What?

833
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,500
White Horse Neighs in the Western Wind,

834
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:43,780
by Jin Yong.

835
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,100
Is this a fake copy?

836
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,500
I've never seen this one

837
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,420
in my dad's bookshelf.

838
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,500
You're a fake son.

839
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,540
This is one of the most classic works

840
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,500
of Jin Yong,

841
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,060
and it's my favorite.

842
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,220
Is this your favorite one?

843
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:06,300
- What's it about?
- See for yourself.

844
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,140
(White Horse Neighs in the Western Wind)

845
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,140
Tell me about it.

846
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,340
I can't concentrate.

847
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,180
Come on, just tell me.

848
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,300
Alright, alright.

849
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,420
This book is about

850
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:22,180
a girl named

851
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,580
Li Wenxiu.

852
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,300
It's about her growth.

853
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,500
The hero is called Su Pu.

854
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,340
Su Pu.

855
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,500
Su Pu and Li Wenxiu

856
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,020
met when they were young.

857
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,420
They...

858
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:37,370
That's how it ends.

859
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,340
What?

860
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,500
I don't get it.

861
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:46,820
Why?

862
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:48,780
Li Wenxiu

863
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,940
likes Su Pu so much.

864
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,300
Why doesn't she tell him?

865
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,220
She didn't say it in childhood.

866
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,580
She should tell him now.

867
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,020
Of course, she can't.

868
00:41:58,860 --> 00:41:59,700
At this point,

869
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,420
Su Pu already likes someone else.

870
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:03,150
Su Pu is a stubborn man.

871
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,000
If she tells him,

872
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:05,380
they won't even

873
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,150
be able to be friends.

874
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,110
Rather than cutting ties,

875
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,620
it's better to maintain the status quo.

876
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,540
Look,

877
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,620
there's a touching line at the end.

878
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,980
That's very, very nice,

879
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,860
but I don't like it.

880
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,380
Oh, by the way,

881
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:36,220
you said you had something
to tell me?

882
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,300
What is it?

883
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:43,460
I...

884
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,100
I just want to ask

885
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,020
what I should prepare after

886
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:51,580
getting into No. 2 Middle School.

887
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:52,940
Prepare?

888
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,420
Why are you leaving?

889
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,100
Rather than cutting ties,

890
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,660
it's better to maintain the status quo.

891
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:20,500
If she tells him,

892
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,380
they won't even be able to be friends.

893
