Good.

28
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,340
Good…

29
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,740
Godmother,

30
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,860
have you noticed something?

31
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,500
Brother Xiao Han tutored me.

32
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,380
Sister Jiayue tutored me too.

33
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,980
But people like them, with good grades,

34
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,260
just can't teach me.

35
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,140
On the other hand,

36
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,020
we are at the same level

37
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,700
and will look the other way to learn.

38
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,300
We get each other, just us.

39
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,420
You're right, Mao Tou.

40
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,380
Though we start off at a lower level,

41
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,500
when you get into

42
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,500
No. 2 Middle School

43
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,300
and I become an air stewardess,

44
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,310
we'll give them some...

45
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,330
"color see see".
[*Means "impress someone"]

46
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,060
We'll definitely give them some

47
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,900
"color see see".

48
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,700
"Color see see". "Color see see"...

49
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,100
Mao Tou, put these folded clothes

50
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,970
from Jiayue

51
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,140
into her wardrobe,

52
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,040
the first shelf on the left.

53
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,120
The first shelf on the left?

54
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,780
Mao Tou?

55
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:06,980
What are you doing?

56
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,420
My mom…

57
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,020
Godmother told me
to give you some color see see…

58
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,380
She's folded your clothes,

59
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,220
and I've put them in.

60
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,660
Thanks.

61
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:27,960
Where are you going?

62
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,020
Aren't you going to study?

63
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,740
That kid messed up my clothes.

64
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,340
The three ways to charge an object,

65
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,700
aside from friction and induction,

66
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,620
there's contact electrification.

67
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:01,940
In simple terms,

68
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,940
it happens
when an uncharged object

69
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,180
touches a charged one.

70
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,740
Do you get it?

71
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,340
Got it.

72
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:12,980
Then let me ask you,

73
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,740
why do some uncharged objects

74
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,700
stay uncharged after they touch
a charged one?

75
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:18,980
Well…

76
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,460
Some objects just don't…

77
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,700
"connect" with others?

78
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,460
"Don't connect"?

79
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,140
That's called an insulator!

80
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,690
Finish these two questions.

81
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,700
How about we call it a day?

82
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,100
I'll think over what I've learned.

83
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,580
You've only been at this for ten minutes!

84
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,440
Do you want to enter No. 2 Middle School?

85
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,180
I do.

86
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,770
Have you never learned sufficient
and necessary conditions?

87
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,580
Let me tell you,

88
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,860
having ambition is not
a sufficient condition for success,

89
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,500
but effort and seriousness
are necessary conditions.

90
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,540
Focus here!

91
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,940
The European delegation
is about to arrive.

92
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,860
We need to greet them

93
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,740
with the utmost enthusiasm.

94
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,260
Understood?

95
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,270
Understood.

96
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,760
Louder! Understood?

97
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,910
Understood!

98
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,020
We are 11th-grade students.

99
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,140
We are taking a PE class.

100
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,860
By the way,

101
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,260
we prepared a dancing performance…

102
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,220
To welcome our dear guests.

103
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,700
Done?

104
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,420
Everyone!

105
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,740
Right face!

106
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,060
Girls,

107
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,780
take two steps forward!

108
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,980
Sir, I need to go to the bathroom.

109
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,860
Just go ahead.

110
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:50,860
Girls!

111
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,100
About-face!

112
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,740
Look, look!

113
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:57,940
Alright!

114
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,000
May I have your attention?

115
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,660
Let's quickly review

116
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,700
the dance moves, okay?

117
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,660
Ka Men,

118
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,620
are you feeling better?

119
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,420
How are you now?

120
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,980
- Be careful.
- Let me help you.

121
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,540
You've been in there three times already.

122
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,660
Should we go to the infirmary?

123
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,420
It's all clean.

124
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,620
Really, it's all clean.

125
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,580
That won't work.

126
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,420
You need to go to the infirmary.

127
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,660
Yeah. My mom says

128
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,040
if you have unexplained diarrhea,

129
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,660
it's serious.

130
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:41,940
Let's go.

131
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,420
Seriously, no need.

132
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,500
I got diarrhea because...

133
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,700
I took slimming pills.

134
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,820
- Slimming pills?
- Slimming pills?

135
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,140
What kind of pills?

136
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,090
(Saifeiyan Slimming Pills)

137
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,660
Those Saifeiyan pills…

138
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,220
They claim anyone can lose 5 kg in a week.

139
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,260
Throw those pills away!

140
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,780
These unapproved slimming pills

141
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,540
will either make you
have the runs or vomit.

142
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,140
Is this little girl really you?

143
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,140
Ka Men was so thin when she was little.

144
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,460
And she was a little host.

145
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,100
Unfortunately, I started gaining weight

146
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,180
in second grade.

147
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,820
I changed completely

148
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,420
after just one summer.

149
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,340
So, this little boy is truly Lu Yao?

150
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,580
You two knew each other that long ago?

151
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,940
But he doesn't remember me.

152
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,420
Why don't you tell him?

153
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,540
Back then, we danced

154
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,460
and hosted together.

155
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,460
The teachers always said
we were a perfect pair.

156
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,660
But now, he's still the "golden boy",

157
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,340
and I'm no longer the "jade girl".

158
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,780
Ka Men.

159
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,180
So these days, you've been working
so hard to lose weight

160
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,820
(Saifeiyan Slimming Pills)
and even taking these pills,

161
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,140
just for Lu Yao?

162
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,620
To make him recognize you?

163
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,820
Why go through all this?

164
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,660
Just tell him straight up,

165
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,340
"I'm Liu Wanqing from back then."

166
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,500
Wouldn't that work?

167
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,540
Back then, I was Liu Wanqing,

168
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,860
but now…

169
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,940
I'm just Ka Men.

170
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,060
But Lu Yao doesn't think

171
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,620
the current Ka Men is bad.

172
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,380
He still wants to host with you,

173
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,100
and even asked for
your help with English.

174
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,180
Yeah.

175
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,420
And you will host together this time,

176
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,940
just like you did back then!

177
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,660
Here's an idea.

178
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,340
Tomorrow, take this photo with you.

179
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,620
After the rehearsal,

180
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,660
walk up to him and say,

181
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,660
"I'm the Liu Wanqing from back then!"

182
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,820
After ten years,

183
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,060
you two are back on the same stage!

184
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,060
That would be so meaningful!

185
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,060
Look,

186
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,180
just extend your hand

187
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,540
and you'll look great.

188
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,220
- Really?
- Just like a princess!

189
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,620
Suddenly, you have that charm.

190
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,660
Hey.

191
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:27,860
Go.

192
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,260
Chen.

193
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,940
Stop making assumptions.

194
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,060
It's none of your business.

195
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,980
Who's making assumptions?

196
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,980
They were talking and laughing,

197
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,020
looking so close!

198
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:43,980
That woman

199
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,980
seems to live on the 12th floor.

200
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,340
Could Liu Songming…

201
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,180
have just come out of her apartment?

202
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,800
What don't you respond?

203
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:54,740
I'm talking to you.

204
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,940
What do you expect me to react to?

205
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,020
I'd suggest

206
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,540
you stay out of it.

207
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,420
That's Pei's husband!

208
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,220
No...

209
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,860
I have to tell Pei tomorrow.

210
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,420
Stay out of their affairs!

211
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,780
Do you even know what's going on
in their marriage?

212
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,740
As it goes, "Don't meddle in

213
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,820
others' business."

214
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,540
If everything works out fine,

215
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,940
you'll just end up looking bad.

216
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,500
Did you see it right?

217
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,620
Was it Liu Songming?

218
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,220
Of course, it was him.
I know him well enough.

219
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,540
That woman lives in Jinxiu Garden?

220
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,900
Yeah, I've seen her before.

221
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,740
She's got big eyes,

222
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,380
a slim waist,

223
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,420
long legs,

224
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,780
and she walks with a wiggle.

225
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,620
Yes! Exactly!

226
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,780
You know her?

227
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,220
- Li Qin.
- Li Qin.

228
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,860
How dare that Liu Dagui…

229
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,860
I think we should

230
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,580
think this over carefully.

231
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,380
All you saw was those two walking out

232
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,500
the front gate.

233
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,260
I think…

234
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,020
Xiu'e!

235
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,350
Pei!

236
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,340
Xiu'e! Xiu'e!

237
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,420
Pei!

238
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,820
I know.

239
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,340
You know?

240
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,740
Liu Dagui

241
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,060
likes dancing,

242
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,140
which is nothing new.

243
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,940
He has a new dance partner, that's all.

244
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,660
Pei,

245
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,500
that woman is Li Qin!

246
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:23,500
Remember?

247
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,660
She used to always go to the canteen

248
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,060
and call out all cutesy,
"Brother Gui! Brother Gui!"

249
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,660
Did they really have to dance at home?

250
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,300
At home?

251
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,580
Pei!

252
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,180
Pei, if something's bothering you,

253
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,140
just say it.

254
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,060
Now you're making us more worried.

255
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,620
What's there to be worried about?

256
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,180
Liu Songming likes dancing,

257
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,620
that's all.

258
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,980
Besides, Li Qin is married.

259
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:58,940
Nothing will happen.

260
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,540
That's true.

261
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,220
Li Qin's husband

262
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,460
is a pilot, making decent money.

263
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,620
She definitely won't let go

264
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,220
of such a steady "meal ticket".

265
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,420
Right?

266
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,380
Pei, I'm sorry.

267
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,460
I think I overreacted.

268
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,220
It's okay.

269
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,420
Wait!

270
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,060
A pilot

271
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,220
who's always away at home?

272
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,870
Pei,

273
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,580
how's Liu Dagui's

274
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,700
waist these days?

275
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,700
You're insane!

276
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,980
How can you even ask that?

277
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,020
I'm just concerned!

278
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,300
How am I insane?

279
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,620
Bring your feet together.

280
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,020
Open.

281
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,820
Push your hands.

282
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,540
Curl them!

283
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:55,980
Look.

284
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,740
Dinner's ready.

285
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,060
Come eat.

286
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,460
I'm not eating.

287
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,460
At least eat some vegetables!

288
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,820
Pei,

289
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,660
come eat.

290
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,660
No.

291
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,420
What's up with both of you?

292
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,860
Is a last-minute attempt going to work?

293
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,020
Some can become little swans
after losing weight,

294
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,620
but no matter how hard you try,

295
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,300
the best you'll be is a big roast duck.

296
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,340
I'm going out.

297
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,660
(Aniu Lixing Restaurant)

298
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,860
That woman is Li Qin! Remember?

299
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,620
She always called out all cutesy, "Brother Gui!

300
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,860
Brother Gui!"

301
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,020
Did they really have to dance at home?

302
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,330
Some can become little swans
after losing weight,

303
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,860
but no matter how hard you try,

304
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,780
the best you'll be is a big roast duck.

305
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:25,620
(Jiale Wontons)

306
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,880
Dagui, hurry up!

307
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,140
The ladies are almost ready!

308
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,570
They can't be late for the interview!

309
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,100
Coming!

310
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,380
Dagui, that outfit looks great on you.

311
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,420
You think so?

312
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,100
Putting in a lot of effort for your wife.

313
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,780
It's not just me putting in effort.

314
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,700
- I also…
- If you're wearing

315
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,020
such tight pants,

316
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,260
don't you think Pei will be worried?

317
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,150
- What's there to worry about?
- He's not going!

318
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,260
Zhang Qiming,

319
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,940
don't you know how many people

320
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,100
your car can fit?

321
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,780
Don't take any extra people, okay?

322
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,100
Pei, it's fine.

323
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,090
I can drop him off first,

324
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:07,980
and then…

325
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,260
That's right. I can just take Qian's...

326
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,340
You're not going!

327
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,780
I won't go then.

328
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,180
Aiping, Xiu'e, I wish you speedy success.

329
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,300
Pei,

330
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,980
good luck to you too.

331
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,100
Hurry up! We'll be late if you don't.

332
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,420
What's going on?

333
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,060
Let's rehearse the closing speech
one more time.

334
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,820
No. Our class is fully cooperating.

335
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,660
Do it your way.

336
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,220
It's an unforgettable night.

337
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,300
Tonight is unforgettable.

338
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,580
To our friends from afar,

339
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,900
we hope you've had

340
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,300
a wonderful time in Shanghai.

341
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,540
We'll meet again.

342
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,700
Dear friends,

343
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,140
please don't forget today.

344
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,040
We sincerely hope

345
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,220
you have had a good time in...

346
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,140
Carmen,

347
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,090
remember to link
"have" and "had" together.

348
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,900
"You've had a good time in Shanghai,"

349
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,740
like this.

350
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,420
You've had a good time.

351
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,500
Good.

352
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:48,940
We sincerely...

353
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:49,780
Ms. Qian.

354
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:51,900
Director Wu.

355
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,780
Director Wu.

356
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,060
Take a short break.

357
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,140
Nice.

358
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,740
Thank you.

359
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,540
If it weren't for your help,

360
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,580
I wouldn't have memorized

361
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,860
all these English lines.

362
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,580
Also,

363
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,980
I feel like we're getting better

364
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:09,980
at working together.

365
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,740
Let me go over it again.

366
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,660
Dear friends from afar,

367
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,380
please don't forget today.

368
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,380
We sincerely...

369
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,360
Tomorrow, take this photo with you.

370
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,670
After the rehearsal,

371
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,570
walk up to him and say,

372
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,580
"I'm the Liu Wanqing from back then!"

373
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,780
After ten years,

374
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:33,940
you two are back on the same stage!

375
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,940
That would be so meaningful.

376
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,660
Had a good time in Shanghai.

377
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,460
And we are looking forward...

378
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,300
Actually...

379
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,860
we've known each other for a long time.

380
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,700
What?

381
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,620
Replace her?

382
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,820
Why do we have to replace her?

383
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,420
This decision came
as a bit of a surprise,

384
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,780
but it was made by the school leaders

385
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,780
after careful consideration.

386
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,580
It's a better match
for the hosts to be Zhao Tingting

387
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,660
and Lu Yao.

388
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,740
Director Wu!

389
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,980
This doesn't seem right!

390
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,380
Liu Wanqing has done so much,

391
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,260
and she's about to host.

392
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,300
Replace her at this moment?

393
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,460
This isn't my decision.

394
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,740
It's made by the leaders.

395
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,460
This event

396
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,700
is crucial for the exchange program.

397
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,900
The hosts we choose

398
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,700
will represent the image of our school.

399
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,940
Why can't Liu Wanqing represent

400
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,180
our school's image?

401
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,060
This decision was made by my superiors.

402
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,540
The school leaders
held a meeting this morning.

403
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,580
This event isn't just for entertainment.

404
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,260
Many factors have to be considered.

405
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,380
Academic performance, knowledge,
appearance, image,

406
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,220
temperament,

407
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,380
and so on... are all included.

408
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,060
The hosts are especially significant.

409
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,940
They will represent our school.

410
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,820
Who set those standards?

411
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,940
When were they set?

412
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,540
You guys just don't like her!

413
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,070
- You just need an excuse!
- Mr. Zhou!

414
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,020
Watch your tone!

415
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,300
My tone is fine.

416
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,980
I just think something's unfair.

417
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,180
I have to point it out!

418
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,340
- Don't bother!
- Mr. Zhou.

419
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,540
- That won't work.
- Tell me.

420
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,100
- Mr. Zhou!
- What's wrong with her?

421
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:02,940
Mr. Zhou!

422
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,700
It's okay.

423
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,900
I'll get changed right now.

424
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,420
Ka Men.

425
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,660
Ka Men!

426
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,300
Director Wu,

427
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,260
I think she and I work really well together.

428
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,420
She's helped me a lot.

429
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,060
- No need to replace...
- Enough!

430
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,060
The decision is final.

431
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,780
Lu Yao,

432
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,860
take a break for now.

433
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,900
Zhao Tingting will be here shortly.

434
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,100

00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,940
What happened?

454
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,460
None of your business.

455
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,060
What's going on?

456
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,500
Not working today.

457
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,180
Is this Liu Wanqing's home?

458
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,900
Mr. Zhou!

459
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,740
Nice to meet you!

460
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,780
Please, take a seat!

461
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,620
No, thank you.

462
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,380
Um… has Wanqing come back yet?

463
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,660
She's back. She is upstairs.

464
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,500
Let me go call her.

465
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,740
Mr. Zhou,

466
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,940
what's going on?

467
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,140
Liu Wanqing,

468
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,100
first of all,

469
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,540
I want you to know

470
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,780
that you did nothing wrong today,

471
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,260
and there's nothing wrong with you.

472
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,100
You have every right to be angry.

473
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,180
As your teacher

474
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,260
and class advisor,

475
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,580
I failed to protect your rights.

476
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,380
I apologize.

477
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,020
Mr. Zhou,

478
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,100
it's not your fault.

479
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,260
I've been thinking about

480
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,940
how I can make up for the hurt
you've experienced.

481
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:58,940
It's not easy.

482
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,340
But I can

483
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,500
offer you this option

484
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,460
within my means.

485
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:07,940
This afternoon,

486
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,580
the delegation of foreign students

487
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,680
will arrive at our school.

488
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,500
Our class is involved in the reception.

489
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,020
We will send some students

490
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,380
to act as tour guides

491
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,620
and take them

492
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,900
around Shanghai

493
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,900
and the campus.

494
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,500
You might wonder

495
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,100
why you should still participate.

496
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,180
Liu Wanqing,

497
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,580
what doesn't break us

498
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,020
only makes us stronger.

499
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:30,980
But this is just

500
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,580
an option for you.

501
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,940
Whether you go or not,

502
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,100
it's entirely up to you.

503
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:49,140
(A Warm Welcome to
the European Exchange Delegation)

504
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,300
Where's Ka Men?

505
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,860
Don't you guys know?

506
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,780
Abbess Miejue...

507
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,580
Director Wu replaced her.

508
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,700
What?

509
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,620
She practiced so hard!

510
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,260
Yeah, just like that!

511
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,500
Look at Zhao Tingting.

512
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,100
That Wu Chunhua is too much!

513
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,980
But where's Ka Men?

514
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,060
I don't know. I haven't seen her.

515
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:22,940
Ka Men!

516
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,540
- Ka Men!
- Ka Men,

517
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,020
are you okay?

518
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:27,860
I'm fine.

519
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,460
Stop saying you're fine!

520
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,860
You practiced so much for this!

521
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,060
That Wu Chunhua is being

522
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:33,900
completely unfair.

523
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:34,940
Ka Men,

524
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:35,980
don't force it.

525
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,300
Let's go back to the classroom.

526
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,140
Exactly.

527
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,660
I promised Mr. Zhou

528
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,780
I'd be our class's tour guide
this afternoon.

529
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,780
You're still going?

530
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,100
Liu Wanqing!

531
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,220
I have to go.

532
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,020
They're just bullying her!

533
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,300
- Exactly!
- Exactly!

534
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,820
Go stand with them.

535
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,900
Alright, Mr. Zhou.

536
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,220
We can discuss things then.

537
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,290
Okay, no problem.

538
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,140
Ka Men's been treated so unfairly.

539
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,660
We can't just let this slide!

540
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,740
Let's start from our dorms.

541
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,740
It's about a five-minute walk.

542
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,060
They're the last group.

543
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,110
Let me introduce them.

544
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,110
Julia.

545
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,890
Daniel. Gene.

546
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:29,750
- Hi.
- I'm Daniel.

547
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,780
They're all yours now.

548
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,220
Enjoy.

549
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,260
Bye.

550
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,220
Nice to meet you all.

551
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,800
My name is Wanqing Liu.

552
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,740
Wan...

553
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,940
You can also call me by my English name,

554
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,580
Carmen.

555
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,530
Carmen.

556
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,420
That's much better.

557
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,940
How're you doing, Carmen?

558
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,170
Not bad.

559
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,380
It could be worse.

560
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,540
Well... We spent two weeks in Beijing

561
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,780
before we come here.

562
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,380
You're the first Chinese student
who didn't reply with

563
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,820
"Fine, thank you."

564
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,020
"And you?"

565
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,660
This sentence is in our textbook.

566
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,620
And many of us think

567
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,520
it is the only correct answer.

568
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,140
But you don't?

569
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,260
No, I don't.

570
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,620
There are always some other great answers.

571
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,340
Just like our lives.

572
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,100
C'est la vie.

573
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,540
C'est la vie?

574
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,660
Carmen, your English is so good.

575
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,420
How do you learn a foreign language?

576
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,740
I learn English by listening to

577
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,900
English songs.

578
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,060
If you want to learn Chinese,

579
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,940
you can start by
listening to Chinese songs too.

580
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,020
Such as Jasmine.

581
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,780
Okay.

582
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,670
Let's start the campus tour,

583
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:55,530
shall we?

584
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,380
Yeah, please.

585
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:57,980
Come here.

586
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,500
This way.

587
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:01,260
This is our library.

588
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,460
There is a big playground in our school.

589
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,220
We often play basketball there.

590
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,420
Where's the library?

591
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,460
The library is in the south corner.

592
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,300
This way.

593
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,260
Go this way.

594
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:34,460
(Warmly welcome textile workers to apply
for the flight attendant position)

595
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,260
Look, look!

596
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,360
I'll get the sign-up form.

597
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,500
The sign-up form is here, right?

598
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,580
Excuse me,

599
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,380
let me grab it first!

600
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,580
There sure are a lot of people.

601
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:05,860
Pei!

602
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,020
What are you doing?

603
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,180
- Pei.
- Come inside!

604
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,740
Go in, go in.

605
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,220
- Zhang Qiming!
- You're not the gatekeeper.

606
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,290
- You've made it this far.
- Come on in!

607
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,380
What's wrong?

608
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,380
The sign-up form.

609
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,560
The sign-up form.

610
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,220
Look at them.

611
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,180
They're all so young.

612
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,100
All the applicants are young.

613
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:41,900
Didn't they say

614
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,700
the position was for women aged 40-50?

615
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:47,220
What are they doing here?

616
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,180
Pei, don't be afraid.

617
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,460
Stand straight.

618
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,740
- Stand straight!
- I just can't!

619
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,860
I'm quitting.

620
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,540
Why?

621
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,020
I...

622
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,740
What?

623
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,300
My qipao split.

624
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,260
Where?

625
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:11,940
Right here.

626
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:12,800
No!

627
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:13,850
It's perfectly fine!

628
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,700
- No?
- It didn't split.

629
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,380
Then it's here.

630
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,020
- It didn't either!
- It's alright.

631
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,800
- Really?
- Don't worry.

632
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,380
The tailor I hired from Suzhou

633
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,380
has amazing skills.

634
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,300
Pei,

635
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,820
you're just imagining it.

636
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,700
Why are you so nervous?

637
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:34,900
Don't forget

638
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,820
that we've been practicing for so long.

639
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,790
It's time to show off
what we've worked on.

640
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:40,940
Exactly!

641
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,860
That's right.

642
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,700
But my qipao seems to

643
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,900
have a life of its own.

644
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,660
Who knows when it will split?

645
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:47,980
Pei,

646
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,140
Fangfang's tailor

647
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,460
is top-notch!

648
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,900
You can move around.
It won't...

649
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,990
- split.
- How about this…

650
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,660
What was that noise?

651
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,700
- Did it split?
- It did!

652
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,340
Come!

653
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,860
Help me check!

654
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:06,940
It did split.

655
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,300
Be careful.

656
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,340
So many trees.

657
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,620
I'm like in a garden now.

658
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,340
Yeah, our school

659
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,860
was built in 1931.

660
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,220
Yeah, 1931.

661
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,140
We have a long history.

662
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,820
Yeah, I see.

663
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,260
You really poured the whole bag in?

664
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,100
Yeah,

665
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,300
I poured it all in!

666
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,580
Thanks for your help, Lu Yao!

667
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,580
If you hadn't warned us in time,

668
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,250
Qian Jiayue and I wouldn't have known

669
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:40,500
Miejue was back.

670
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,980
Qian Jiayue is the real hero.

671
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:42,900
Did you see how she

672
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:43,920
rushed out to stop Miejue?

673
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:44,980
True.

674
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,170
Glad she thought of that.

675
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,860
An interview for the school journal?

676
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,540
We've given Ka Men some justice.

677
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:50,860
Yeah.

678
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,700
Yes!

679
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,580
Chemistry lab. Do you have one?

680
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,220
Of course!

681
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,020
- Let me show you.
- Okay.

682
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,460
This way.

683
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,620
Look!

684
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,100
How's it going? Is it sewn up?

685
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,620
No problem at all!

686
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,140
Really, no traces left at all.

687
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,600
I'm lucky you brought the sewing kit.

688
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:15,020
My thread snapped a few times.

689
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:15,940
I brought it

690
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,980
just in case.

691
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,740
And guess what? Your thread didn't snap,

692
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,740
but mine did.

693
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,060
My clothes didn't snap,

694
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,580
but my mind snapped.

695
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,500
Okay, you go.

696
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,420
I'm not going.

697
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,940
It's too embarrassing.

698
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,420
(Important Notes for Applicants)
Pei.

699
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,860
We've come this far.

700
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,100
Are you sure about this?

701
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,860
I don't want to deceive myself.

702
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,420
I knew

703
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,700
I'd make a fool of myself,

704
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,580
but I was pretending it was just for fun.

705
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,620
But you guys are different.

706
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,260
You're all

707
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,660
so much prettier

708
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,460
than those young girls.

709
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,140
Don't worry about me!

710
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,620
I'll go home soon.

711
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,420
Some things need to

712
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,340
be sorted out.

713
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:06,860
Right?

714
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,620
Alright!

715
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,580
Hurry. You go on in.

716
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:10,820
Just go.

717
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:11,980
Give me back my bag.

718
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,060
You've already entered,

719
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,540
- and you've signed up.
- Zhang Qi...

720
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,160
Even if

721
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,670
- you won't make it,
- Come back here!

722
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,870
you can still work as a chef!

723
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:19,900
I made it!

724
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,780
Missed the No. 17 bus,

725
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,740
so I took a taxi.

726
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,940
I thought you started the interview.

727
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,580
The qipao split.

728
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,740
I sewed it so many times!

729
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,620
Isn't it fine?

730
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,260
You sewed it?

731
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,380
It's not Pei's qipao,

732
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,220
it's mine that split.

733
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,900
I didn't notice,

734
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,100
Liu Dagui, you know how to sew?

735
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,740
I can do everything

736
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,700
except fixing airplanes.

737
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,740
Stop bragging.

738
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,620
Alright.

739
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:07,980
Here.

740
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,060
What?

741
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,820
I thought it over. I already bought this.

742
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,660
I'll regret it if I don't bring it to you.

743
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,740
Pin it on the qipao

744
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,180
to complete the look.

745
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,060
Why did you buy this?

746
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,970
I don't have secret money.

747
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,540
I taught someone to dance
and made extra money.

748
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,020
Who did you teach?

749
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,620
Li Qin's husband.

750
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,180
You taught the pilot to dance?

751
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,140
I went to the community
activity center to dance.

752
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,500
Li Qin and her husband were there.

753
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,940
They said they needed to

754
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,060
learn ballroom

755
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,020
for a business event

756
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:46,940
and asked me for help.

757
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,140
Push your hands.

758
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,340
Curl them!

759
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,620
Look.

760
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:54,980
Good!

761
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,340
- No problem.
- I think so.

762
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,970
- No problem at all.
- Pei, you are here.

763
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,460
Honey, come learn.

764
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,300
Your turn.

765
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,100
You two dance so well,

766
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,060
but I can't do it.

767
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,380
No worries, we'll take it slow.

768
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,180
So... you went to their home to...

769
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,900
How do you know that?

770
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,540
Yes, you both live in Jinxiu Garden!

771
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,420
Li Qin's husband

772
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,900
is so busy that he couldn't make it

773
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,380
to the activity center,

774
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,540
so I went to teach him at their home.

775
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,580
I charged an extra 50 yuan
for home visits.

776
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,920
Three days for 500 yuan.

777
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,500
A brooch for 498.

778
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,500
498?

779
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:37,980
Oh no,

780
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,060
looks like we wronged Liu Dagui.

781
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,660
I told you

782
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,180
not to judge too early.

783
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,460
It's all my fault. I shouldn't have...

784
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,420
What's going on?

785
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:47,820
What?

786
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,460
Well, we'll let you guys chat.

787
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,740
Let's go upstairs.

788
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,140
Come on, I'll go with you two.

789
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,620
- Let's go.
- There's nothing to talk about!

790
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,450
Xiu'e!

791
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,980
What's with them? Out of their minds?

792
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,460
I get it now.

793
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,380
Did you see me with Li Qin?

794
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,180
That's why

795
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,100
you've been cold to me
these past few days.

796
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,540
Isn't it your fault
for not saying earlier?

797
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,260
Feeling guilty?

798
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,660
What guilt?

799
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,820
What do I have to feel guilty about?

800
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,300
Quiet!

801
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:27,060
I know you don't like Li Qin,

802
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,260
and I want you to focus on the interview.

803
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,100
Fine, fine!

804
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,860
I just wanted to make some extra money

805
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,140
to buy this for you.

806
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,220
Li Qin is

807
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,580
so sweet and gentle.

808
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,980
Even if she didn't pay you,
you'd still be happy.

809
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,020
Come on!

810
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:41,770
Don't you know

811
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:42,820
what kind of person she is?

812
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,420
What kind of person?

813
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,260
A drama queen!

814
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,500
I figured her out a long time ago.

815
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,220
You know, her current husband

816
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,860
is so worn out because of her.

817
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,580
Also, her sense of rhythm is terrible.

818
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,780
Her coordination

819
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,460
and flexibility are worse than yours.

820
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,020
After this interview,

821
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,140
I'll teach you how to dance.

822
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,700
We'll dance together,

823
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,940
and I won't have to look for
a dance partner anymore!

824
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,820
Who said I'm dancing with you?

825
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,460
Alright, alright, come here.

826
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,580
Put it on.

827
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,980
I don't want your roast duck.

828
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,300
Swan! A white swan!

829
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,540
Worth 498 yuan!

830
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,380
Fine! I'll wear it!

831
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:19,780
Pei!

832
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,460
Are you ready?

833
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,380
If you two have private matters,

834
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,580
go home and talk!

835
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,820
Old couple,

836
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:30,660
no private matters!

837
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:31,700
I'm coming.

838
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,380
Do it.

839
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,660
Do what?

840
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,540
Do it.

841
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,180
So many people here. So embarrassing.

842
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,620
Do it!

843
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,380
Who asked you to dance?

844
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,420
I asked you to wipe my forehead!

845
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,500
Your forehead isn't sweaty!

846
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,020
Get lost.

847
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,220
Don't forget to wear it!

848
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,060
I heard you!

849
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:18,060
Now, here comes our show!

850
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:19,660
Music!

851
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,250
Go. You go first.

852
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,940
Slow down. Slow down.

854
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:37,090

(Welcome—you—future air stewardesses!)

861
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,380
Sisters, your performance just now

862
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,740
was absolutely stunning!

863
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,180
Congratulations!

864
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,460
Amazing!

865
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,860
You're truly our role models!

866
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,420
It was so beautiful!

867
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,300
Alright.

868
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,700
We're flattered. You're really kind to say so.

869
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:44,860
Yeah.

870
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,540
We've already exchanged numbers.

871
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:48,420
We'll keep in touch.

872
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,140
- Sure.
- Let's stay in touch!

873
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,740
We hope to hear good news from you!

874
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,540
Goodbye.

875
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,580
Grab a few more coupons.

876
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,020
You'll have good news for sure!

877
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,620
Be sure to come eat at my restaurant!

878
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,540
What's the result?

879
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,300
- What's the result?
- Did you make it?

880
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,460
We didn't pass.

881
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,100
We got eliminated.

882
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,540
You're lying!

883
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,700
Then how come you're so happy?

884
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,360
- That's right!
- They don't believe us.

885
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,940
We really didn't make it.

886
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,140
It's true.

887
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,030
But…

888
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,700
we were only one vote short.

889
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,460
That's such a pity!

890
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,860
Secretary Yu encouraged us.

891
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:24,900
He said we were graceful

892
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,900
and confident during the performance.

893
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,340
There will be many more opportunities.

894
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,900
He even invited us

895
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,380
to perform

896
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,700
at their annual gathering!

897
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,100
Really?

898
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,620
That means your performance

899
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,900
must have been spectacular!

900
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,260
Incredible!

901
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:41,140
This is what we call "defeat with honor"!

902
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,340
Yes, yes!

903
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,580
Old but vigorous!

904
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:47,570
Who's old?

905
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:48,980
That's not what I mean.

906
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,660
What's next? Go home?

907
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,340
Alright, we're going home.

908
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,140
Excuse me!

909
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,870
I'm a reporter from the Evening News.

910
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,820
Your performance during the interview

911
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,100
really moved me.

912
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,340
Would it be okay if I interviewed you?

913
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,340
Xinmin Evening News?

914
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,260
What else would it be in Shanghai?

915
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,380
Yes.

916
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,900
Interview… us?

917
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,300
Is that alright?

918
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,380
Of course.

919
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,580
What would you like to ask?

920
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,340
Great! But first,

921
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,460
let the photographer

922
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,860
take a picture of you, okay?

923
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,020
Sure, sure!

924
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,700
Not including the two gentlemen.

925
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,590
- Thank you.
- Okay.

926
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,780
Stand away.

927
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,220
- Join us.
- I'll pass on this one.

928
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,060
Go on, go on!

929
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,860
- Come on, Fangfang!
- Come on!

930
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,380
Let's have four of you together!

931
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,100
- Perfect.
- Come, stand here.

932
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:31,940
Let's get ready.

933
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,200
- Look here.
- Ready?

934
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:34,370
Okay.

935
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,860
Three, two, one!

936
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,860
Could you relax a little more?

937
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,900
Bring the energy

938
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,300
from your dance performance back!

939
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,140
Exactly.

940
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,340
- Come again?
- The dance.

941
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,420
- Okay.
- During the dance.

942
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,300
Like we did on stage.

943
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,460
That's a great pose.

944
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,380
Three, two, one.

945
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:51,260
Cheese!

946
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:53,940
Nice!

947
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,260
- One more.
- Change your pose.

948
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,160
Let's take another one.

949
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,100
Three, two, one.

950
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,020
Smile!

951
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,460
- Nice!
- I squinted just now.

952
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,460
Let's take another.

953
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,020
Another one, another one!

954
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,220
Let's face that way.

955
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,060
- Okay.
- Hands on your hips.

956
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,300
Head back? Alright.

957
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,300
Three, two, one.

958
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:17,940
This pose looks great.

959
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:18,780
Gorgeous!

960
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,580
Another one, another one!

961
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,220
Poured salt into Wu Chunhua's cup?

962
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,140
How dare you do that?

963
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,660
We really did it.

964
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,820
Chen Mo said she'd get revenge for you,

965
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,140
so I joined in and poured a little too.

966
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,980
Did you see her drink it?

967
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,100
No.

968
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,580
It was so close!

969
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,740
When we were halfway through,

970
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,300
she suddenly came back.

971
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,500
Luckily, Lu Yao warned us in time.

972
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:53,660
I went out

973
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,220
to pretend to interview her.

974
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,540
Then, Lu Yao helped

975
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:58,580
Chen Mo escape.

976
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,980
But when Chang Wuji

977
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,740
went to the office, he saw it.

978
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,380
He said she immediately spat out the water!

979
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,940
She kept asking

980
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:08,620
who slipped into the office!

981
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,100
(Jiale Wontons)

982
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,740
How did you guys come up with this idea?

983
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,660
But… Ka Men,

984
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:17,860
are you feeling better?

985
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:22,860
You guys were in class all day,

986
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:24,460
while I had fun all day.

987
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,660
Tomorrow, I'm taking them

988
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,740
to the Jinmao Tower
and the Oriental Pearl Tower.

989
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,900
Aren't you jealous?

990
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,980
Come on!

991
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:37,660
Don't worry!

992
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,140
Fine.

993
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,340
Well then…

994
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:41,940
see you tomorrow.

995
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,260
See you tomorrow!

996
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:46,740
I'm going home now.

997
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:49,540
Go ahead.
