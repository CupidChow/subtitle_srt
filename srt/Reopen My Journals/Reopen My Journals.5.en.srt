(Jiale Wontons)

25
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,550
Yes!

26
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,070
Tell him,

27
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,790
his wife is angry. Call her now!

28
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:53,840
How many calls?

29
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,000
Men are the same.

30
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,320
Once they marry,

31
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,240
they become so heartless.

32
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,640
I agree.

33
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,910
Agree.

34
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,470
I... I also agree.

35
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,470
- Mrs. Qian.
- Han.

36
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,310
Mrs. Liu.

37
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,000
Han, why are you here?

38
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,190
It's raining outside.

39
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,280
I got you an umbrella.

40
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,190
Fangfang, this is my son Xiao Han.

41
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,910
- Hello, Auntie.
- Hello, you're so tall.

42
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,310
By the way,

43
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,400
Han can fetch
some umbrellas for you.

44
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,470
Yes, I'll go...

45
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,490
- Oh, no need.
- No need.

46
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,310
No need.

47
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,310
It's about to stop.

48
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,680
Yes, we can leave soon.

49
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,710
Alright, I'm running out of time.

50
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,580
I'll head to Mr. Zhu's place.

51
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,520
The road is slippery.

52
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,840
- Goodbye then.
- Bye.

53
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,280
- Goodbye.
- Watch your step. Be careful.

54
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,800
Let's go.

55
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,000
Let me take this.

56
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,030
Xiu'e, have a seat.

57
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,120
Make some space.

58
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,680
- What?
- Make some space.

59
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,310
Now you want to sit?

60
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,680
You said you didn't want to.

61
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,750
You occupied the seat.

62
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,080
Ridiculous.

63
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,400
These snacks are for my baby.

64
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,910
You can have some first.

65
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,520
Now you're taking them out.

66
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,000
What? You didn't ask.

67
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,630
Help me open it, okay?

68
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,000
Stop talking, just eat.

69
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,520
It's really tasty.

70
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,000
You can't open it yourself?

71
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,280
Just give me a hand.

72
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,310
Stop complaining, okay?

73
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,680
You should stop talking.

74
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,690
- Just zip it, okay?
- Try Figs.

75
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,470
Try it.

76
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,910
Did you notice one thing?

77
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,960
A good guy

78
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,960
is either someone else's son...

79
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,800
Exactly.

80
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,120
Or someone else's husband.

81
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,190
Or someone else's father.

82
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,630
Someone else's father.

83
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,400
Fangfang,

84
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,490
is your daughter
at No. 2 Middle School?

85
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,870
- Yes.
- Which class?

86
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,030
Class 5.

87
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,800
She's Jiayue's classmate?

88
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,640
Qian Jiayue?

89
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,590
The one with big eyes.

90
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,710
She looks like me a lot.

91
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,710
She's a pretty girl.

92
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,800
I've heard about Qian Jiayue.

93
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,310
Chen Mo talked about her.

94
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,740
- She said...
- Don't believe her.

95
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,590
Jiayue is not like her at all.

96
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,560
Jiayue is prettier.

97
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,520
- Not like me?
- No.

98
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,000
Ka Men doesn't take after you either.

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,120
It's Qing.

100
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,000
What's with Ka Men, okay?

101
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,870
Qing looks exactly the same as me!

102
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,000
Exactly the same?

103
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,890
(Welcome, Come Next Time)
Younger version of me.

105
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,160
Ka Men, come on.

106
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,120
- Qian Jiayue.
- Thanks.

107
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,160
Chen Mo, your place is amazing.

108
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,240
I know, right?

109
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,190
Look at the CDs on the wall.

110
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,510
I was stunned when I first came.

111
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,880
Chen Mo.

112
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,870
Can I borrow these two?

113
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,190
Sure, no problem.

114
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,390
- Chen Mo, you have OICQ?
- Thanks.

115
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,230
I have it too.

116
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,830
Tell me your account. I'll add you.

117
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,390
Alright, no problem.

118
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,000

121
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,750
It was just a misunderstanding.

122
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:04,160
She's actually a very nice person.

125
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,600
Sometimes, take a step back,

126
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,190
and you'll discover
new perspectives and views in life.

127
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,750

That's a secret.

In the internet world,

134
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,270
isn't it better to be mysterious?

135
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,430
Mysterious?

136
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,920

Sorry, I'm late!

140
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,220
Should we take the main road
or the shortcut?

141
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,600
Main road. We have time.

142
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,920
Alright, let's go.

143
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,680
Just wait a minute.

144
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,760

145
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,950
Very soon, very soon.

146

Brother Xiao Han!

147
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,680
It's that pretentious guy again.

148
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,880
Good morning, Jiayue.

149
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,790
Morning.

150
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,400
Brother Xiao Han.

151
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,560
I've learned to ride a bike.

152

Let's go together today.

153
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,480
I'll host the flag-raising ceremony,

154
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,390
so I need to be faster.

155
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,480
Sorry, I can't join you.

156
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,870
I can ride really fast.

157
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,360
Don't force him, okay?

158
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,750
He's from the key class.

159
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,070
He doesn't want to play with

160
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,310
students from regular classes.

161
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,680
We shouldn't bother him.

162

Qian Jiayue.

163
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:32,800
I really admire you.

164
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,070
You can actually listen to
such a boring speech

165
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,070
and take it seriously.

166
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,560
She's the bigger version of Pei Dongni.

167
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,630

Like we're kindergarten kids.

171

Let's welcome Xiao Han
from Class 1, Grade 10

172
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,070
to give a speech.

173
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,620
- What's wrong?
- Teacher,

174
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,000
I feel sick. I need to go home.

175
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,270
Is it serious? I can...

176
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,640
No need. I'll take her.

177
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,480
Alright.

178
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,320
Jiayue.

179
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,310
As the saying goes,
one takes the behavior

180
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,360
of one's company.

181
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,800
You should know good people.

182
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,480
High school years are very important.

183
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,630
- Well...
- I'm in a hurry. Bye.

184
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,110
Take care.

185
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,200
Hey...

186
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,120
Loner Xiao.

187
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,600
Take the shortcut.

188
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,910
We'll pass him.

189
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,440
Let's go.

190
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,300
(Shanghai Puyang No. 2 Middle School)

191
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,150
Class dismissed.

192
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,390
Goodbye, teacher.

193
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,480
Ka Men, Ka Men.

194
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,270
How was your quiz?

195
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,350
Not much done.

196
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,800
I wrote everything I knew.

197
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,720
Same here.

198
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,760
Xiao Han.

199
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,040
I'll talk to Brother Xiao Han.

200
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,600
What's their relationship?

201
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,230
Just neighbors.

202
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,600
Just ordinary neighbors?

203
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,270
Not that ordinary, though.

204
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,560
They grew up together.

205
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,510
Xiao Han often eats at her place.

206
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,560
Why doesn't he eat at home?

207
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,070
His dad passed early

208
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,750
when putting out a fire.

209
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,390
His mom has two jobs

210
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,480
and doesn't have time.

211
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,670
I see.

212
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,480
Maybe I shouldn't bother him.

213
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,080
Don't be fooled by his appearance.

214
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,920
He looks serious

215
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,480
and unapproachable,

216
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,200
but he's actually quite nice.

217
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,510
You'll find out.

218
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:46,100
(Jiale Wontons)

219
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,030
The green peppers are great, right?

220
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,270
Pei.

221
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,510
The business is good.

222
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,440
Is there a notice?

223
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,150
Xiu'e, look at the notice.

224
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:54,990
Three buns.

225
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,920

226
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,340
- What's posted?
- Here you are.

227
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,480
What does it say?

228
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,480

230
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,080
Really?
Singapore-Malaysia-Thailand tour?

231
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,920
Look.

232
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,480
Participate in the talent competition
with your family.

233
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,120
Talent competition, you know?

234
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,080
Singing, reciting, and dancing.

235
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,080
All kinds of talents.

236
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,390
Liu Songming.

237
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,840
Stop twerking.

238
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,390
You have a business.

239
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,360
Go make wontons.

240
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,100
- Tacky.
- Did you pay?

241
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,720
I shouldn't cast pearls
before swine, you know?

242
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,720
Hurry up!

243
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:35,770

248
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,240
Money's on the table.

249
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,140
- I'm leaving.
- Okay.

250
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:49,990
- Thanks.
- Goodbye.

251
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,120
- Mr. Zhang.
- You finished?

252
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,200
Take care.

253
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,200
Mr. Zhang, you're here.

254
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,630
You look handsome.

255
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,600
Tell me what you want to eat.

256
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,560
Okay, no problem.

257
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,560
Aiping.

258
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,750
Aiping.

259
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,200
Why are you here?

260
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,280
Don't be angry.

261
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,750
I shouldn't have beaten Mao Tou.

262
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,080
But I know the reason
why you're angry

263
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,200
and... and blaming me

264
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,870
is because you see me as family, right?

265
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,270
Who's your family?

266
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,560
Well...

267
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,870
Let's participate in
the Model Family Competition.

268
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,510
What's that got to do with us?

269
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,960
Of course it's relevant.

270
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,910
You and I are good.

271
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,320
Han and Mao Tou are good.

272
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,000
We're good together.

273
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,270
What nonsense are you talking about?

274
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,550
Actually, I want to take this chance

275
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,440
to show our relationship.

276
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,600
And the kids

277
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,200
can be prepared.

278
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,200
Zhang Qiming, Mr. Zhang.

279
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,510
You're here again.

280
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,790
What does it mean by again?

281
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,000
What do you want to eat?

282
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,440
Pork chop noodles.

283
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,270
Liu Songming,

284
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,630
make pork chop noodles.

285
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,960
- Sure.
- Pork chop noodles.

286
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,080
I want a big one.

287
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,150
Last time, it was so small.

288
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,150
It was like sliced meat noodles.

289
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,270
Are you serious?

290
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,840
It was not that small, okay?

291
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,590

292
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,390
Pei and Gui,

293
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,480
what a perfect match.

294
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,910
You should also sign up for

295
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,240
the Model Family Competition.

296
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,870
Gui, why don't you perform a show?

297
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,030
Zhang Qiming,

298
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,480
I've told you many times

299
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,970
I changed my name long ago.

300
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,150
My official name is Liu Songming now.
[*Songming: Pine Tree and Bright Light]

301
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,870
Pine trees stand straight,

302
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,140
and the moon shines on the stream.

303
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,540
Liu Songming.

304
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,750
That's indeed elegant.

305
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,590
Truly elegant.

306
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,290
Since you're elegant,

307
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:44,990
why not go on stage
and show your elegance?

308
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,390
Do that Cha-cha Dance.

309
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,840
Show your elegance, okay?

310
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,270
That's Latin Dance.

311
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,080
What Cha-cha Dance?

312
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,480
I'm casting pearls before swine,

313
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,320
okay?

314
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,150
None of you are going.

315
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,360
If I go alone,

316
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,270
it'll be boring.

317
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,320
Zhang Qiming.

318
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,080
Are you signing up?

319
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,320
Why can't I?

320
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,080
No single-parent family?

321
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,080
It's not like that.

322
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:09,970
Besides...

323
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,480
Aiping, let's form a team.

324
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,820
Two from your family,
and two from mine.

325
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,790
We can team up,

326
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,960
right?

327
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,800
We can team up.

328
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,960
Are you kidding me?

329
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,440
The Competition is family-based.

330
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,360
Are you kidding me?

331
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,480
Look at the notice. It says:

332
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,870
For the 50th National Day.

333
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,240
Our country is like a big family, right?

334
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,480
Even though we're not blood-related,

335
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,080
we've been neighbors for years.

336
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,670
We're even closer

337
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,910
than family.

338
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,600
Besides, I offered the prize.

339
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,600
Director Zhao

340
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,870
will respect me for that, right?

341
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,150
I get it now.

342
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,630
You're keeping it to yourself.

343
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,390
You provide the prize,

344
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,750
and you earn it yourself.

345
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,630
Well, only capable people can earn it.

346
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,080
Right? Only the winner

347
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,030
can get the big prize.

348
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,040
Liu Songming,

349
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,490
the prize Mr. Zhang offered

350
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:58,320
must be expensive.

351
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,150
Singapore-Malaysia-Thailand Tour!

352
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,560
So,

353
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,320
are you in?

354
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,670
Of course, I'm in!

355
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:05,960
- Really?
- Absolutely!

356
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,120
- You in?
- I'm in.

357
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,200
Aiping.

358
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,790
Don't miss Mr. Zhang's prize.

359
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,750
Exactly.

360
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:13,840
If you don't team up,

361
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,150
we'll team up with him.

362
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,030
- Not you.
- You... You want to team up...

363
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,270
We'll be a big family.

364
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,480
Why team up with him?

365
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,910
What kind of family?

366
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,390
Well, parents,

367
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,550
son and daughter,

368
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,600
a happy family of four.

369
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,270
And there's Mao Tou, making it five.

(Shanghai Puyang No. 2 Middle School)

371
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,270
This time, the highest score

372
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,150
goes to Pei Dongni, 98 points.

373
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,150
Pei Dongni has really worked hard.

374
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,750
As for the lowest score,

375
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,270
someone scored 25 points.

This student,

377
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,510
I'll spare you this time.

378
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,540
I won't call your name.

379
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,750
(Politics Quiz)
Reflect on yourself.

380
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,480
Did you listen to classes?

381
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,480
Did you do your homework properly?

382
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,030
The papers

383
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,790
need your parents' signatures.

384
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,750
Do you have a problem?

385
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,910
It's the first quiz this semester.

386
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,270
Did you take it seriously?

387
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,150
This is a warning.

388
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,720
Even quizzes need parents' signatures.

389
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,360
She's so strict.

390
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,150
I've noticed that some students

391
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,200
are not worried about

392
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,440
the results at all.

393
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,590
Chang Wuji.

394
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,000
Teacher.

395
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,390
How much did you score?

396
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,620
(Politics Quiz)

397
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,200
25 points.

398
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:48,840
He also got 25 points?

399
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,270
You scored 25 points.

400
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,960
How dare you sleep?

401
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,840
Do you remember the score

402
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,550
of your Chinese class placement exam?

403
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,030
You think you can slack off

404
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,370
just because you're good at math?

405
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,150
What about other subjects?

406
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,540
What about College Entrance Exam?

407
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,670
Mr. Zhou came to your class

408
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,960
for you instead of
being the headteacher

409
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,840
of the key class.

410
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,360
Think about it.

411
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,720
- For him?
- How can you do this to him?

412
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:14,960
I don't know.

413
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,920
Write a review

414
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,840
and get your parent's signature.

415
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:18,990
Take a seat.

416
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,840
Let's review the four major questions

417
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,910
of this quiz.

418
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,910
(Class 5, Grade 10)
The necessity

419
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:27,750
and significance...

420
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,000
Alright, class dismissed.

421
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,310
Goodbye, teacher.

422
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,960
Goodbye, Ms. Wu.

423
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,440
Chang Wuji.

424
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,550
What's your score on the Chinese exam?

425
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,870
- 32 points.
- 32 points?

426
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,320
Lower than mine!

427
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,910
Let's shake hands.

428
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,030
We both failed, bro.

429
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,600
What about math?

430
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,910
99.5 points.

431
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,360
99.5 points?

432
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,240
Qian Jiayue, what about you?

433
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,790
62 points. What about you?

434
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:02,870
43 points.

435
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,390
What about Ka Men?

436
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,080
59 points.

437
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,670
I almost passed.

438
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,910
It was a difficult exam,

439
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,630
and you scored 99.5 points?

440
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:13,750
That's right.

441
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,870
Brother Xiao Han only passed 80 points.

442
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,600
Chang Wuji, you're a genius.

443
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,910
So, you're really a genius.

444
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,870
Not really.

445
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,150
Chang Wuji.

446
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,120
Are you really tired?

447
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,670
I slept late last night.

448
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,190
What are you working so hard
at the beginning

449
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,440
of this semester?

450
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,750
My dad needed someone
to play mahjong with,

451
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,840
so he forced me to play until 2 a.m.

452
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,790
Anything else?

453
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,360
If nothing else, I'll take a nap.

454
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,480
Go ahead, get some rest.

455
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:01,980
(Class 1, Grade 10)

456
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,960
Have you heard?

457
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,240
The Olympiad Math Team

458
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,310
is about to compete.

459
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,000
Actually, our Olympiad Math Team

460
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,840
is quite strong.

461
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,920
Last year, a senior

462
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,660
won a National First Prize
and got into Tsinghua University.

463
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,390
Three City First Prize winners
went to Jiao Tong University.

464
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,290
It's great to join
the Olympiad Math Team.

465
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,590
Let's do our best
in the competitive exam.

466
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,160
The placement exam
also had this question.

467
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:37,400
Exactly the same.

468
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,550
Not just this question.

469
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,720
Look at this,

470
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,190
this,

471
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,110
and this. We faced them before.

472
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,350
Yes, we did.

473
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,270
I heard that the questions

474
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,310
of the Olympiad Math Team
Competitive Exam

475
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,550
are from Mr. Zhou Wei.

476
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,160
My mom's colleague

477
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,680
got this from another city for her son.

478
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,240
He lent it to me.

479
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,400
My mom plans
to get me a new set.

480
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,520
Do you want it?

481
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,830
180 yuan.

482
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,200
If you want it, I can get you one.

483
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,880
180 yuan?

484
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,000
That's so expensive.

485
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,740
(Inverse Trigonometric Functions
and Trigonometric Equations)

486
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,480
Baby, are you the class leader now?

487
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,240
We have two pieces of good news.

488
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,510
Mom, I'm not the class leader yet.

489
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,880
I'm just running for it.

490
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,920
I don't know the results.

491
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,000
Who else could it be?

492
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,680
Of course they'll choose you.

493
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,590
It's No. 2 Middle School.

494
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:43,240
Ka Men and Chen Mo said
they'd run for other positions.

495
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:44,670
Godmother.

496
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,960
You said two pieces of good news.

497
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,440
What's the other one?

498
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,240
The other good news is

499
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,710
we're going on
a Singapore-Malaysia-Thailand tour.

500
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:56,480
When did this happen?

501
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,550
I have no idea.

502
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,070
For this National Day,

503
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,000
our neighborhood will host
a Model Family Competition,

504
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,880
and the first prize
is a Singapore-Malaysia-Thailand tour.

505
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,960
Model Family?

506
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,350
Us?

507
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,640
What kind of family
can join the competition?

508
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,590
Our family meets every standard.

509
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,840
Well,

510
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,350
I respect the elderly
and care for the young.

511
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:31,880
I earnestly sell
thermal underwear, right?

512
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,480
I followed the government's guidance

513
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,680
on reemployment.

514
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,000
Under your leadership

515
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,030
as the former union chairwoman,

516
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,310
we're a loving

517
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,720
and happy family.

518
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,880
That's wonderful.

519
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:45,870
Yes.

520
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,000
Godmother is right.

521
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,080
Right?

522
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,830
My dad said we'd also sign up for it.

523
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,400
Why are you signing up?

524
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,240
Only two members.

525
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:55,670
No.

526
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,760
My dad said

527
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,000
we'd team up with Xiao Han's family.

528
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,960
Model family.

529
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,680
You can team up?

530
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,830
It's a good choice.

531
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,670
I support you.

532
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,350
I haven't seen
Aiping's performance for so long.

533
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,430
Han.

534
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,350
I'm back.

535
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:13,670
Mom.

536
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,520
The rice is ready.

537
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,680
I'll get it for you.

538
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,350
Mom.

539
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,550
You just came back.

540
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,390
Stop doing laundry.

541
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,430
Leave it to me.

542
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,350
Have dinner first.

543
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,000
I don't need your help.

544
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,480
Han.

545
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,000
There's 200 yuan on the table.

546
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,160
I got paid today.

547
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,680
Take the money.

548
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,720
If you need tutorial books

549
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,720
or anything else,

550
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,790
just handle it yourself.

551
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,750
180 yuan. Do you want it?

552
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,070
If you want it, I can get you one.

553
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,640
I bet

554
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,400
Mr. Zhou will definitely
refer to this book

555
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,790
for the competitive exam.

556
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,400
Think about the direct admission.

557
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,840
Mom.

558
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,240
I don't need money.

559
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,400
This washing machine has been broken.

560
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,590
Use the money to fix it.

561
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,720
Han.

562
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,590
I want to discuss something with you.

563
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,590
This Friday, can you go to

my boss Mr. Zhu's place with me

565
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,110
for a meal?

566
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,550
Do I have to?

567
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,640
Mr. Zhu's son Meng

568
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,310

569

Mr. Zhu and Mrs. Zhu

570
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,770
know you're
the student council president,

571
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:44,920
so they want you

572
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,200
to talk to him

573
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,110
and help him.

574
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,080

- Brother Xiao Han, here.
- Jiayue.

582
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,240
Granny told me to give this to you.

583
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,000
Thank Granny for me.

584
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,080
You're welcome.

585
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,680
Is that Jiayue?

586
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,480
Mrs. Xiao.

587
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,510
Jiayue, you brought us gifts again.

588
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,030
Just some apples.

589
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,240
My dad bought a lot.

590

Okay.

592
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,110
By the way, Brother Xiao Han,

593
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,750
I'll run for the leader.

594
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,550

(What's the duty of a class leader?)

596

No need to change it.

598

604
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,350
Wait a minute.

605
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,040
Hold on.

606
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,640
This is homemade dried tangerine peel.

607
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,070
Give it to Chairwoman Liao.

608
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,880
Tell her to brew it in water.

609
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,960
It's good for health.

610
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,830

Be patient with her.

617

Don't brush her off.

00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,790
Nothing.

754
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,400
She was crying.

755
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,440
My eyes were just uncomfortable.

756
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,070
About the Class Committee.

757
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,400
I need to go.

758
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:03,680
You got the most votes,

759
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,240
but Pei Dongni became the class leader.

760
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,640
I don't want to be the leader.

761
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:07,830
It's too annoying.

762
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,790
Sports Committee Member suits me.

763
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,920
Arts Committee Member suits you too.

764
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,270
Mr. Zhou has good judgments.

765
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:18,480
Qian Jiayue only needed one more vote.

766
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,960
It was so close.

767
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,560
Yes.

768
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:24,070
We were talking about supporting her.

769
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,480
In the end, we both got elected.

770
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,240
I thought she'd make it

771
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,680
and regain confidence.

772
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,070
Now it's worse.

773
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:34,070
She thinks too much

774
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,290
and takes it too seriously.

775
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,200
It's not just that.

776
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,200
What really upsets her...

777
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,310
What is it?

778
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,400
What is it?

779
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:58,310
No wonder you two
are always so mysterious.

780
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,350
Just tell me who it is.

781
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,240
Why can't you tell me?

782
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,790
I won't tell anyone.

783
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,990
Maybe I can give her a push.

784
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,880
Actually, you know him.

785
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,310
I know him?

786
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,480
Who is it?

787
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,760
Well,

788
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,480
a genius who's not into women.

789
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,680
Not into women?

790
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,200
A genius?

791
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,110
Chang Wuji, you're a genius.

792
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,400
You're really a genius.

793
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:34,670
Not really.

794
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,590
You figured it out yourself.

795
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,880
I didn't say anything.

796
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:52,130
Can't you open it?

797
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,040
Yes.

798
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,830
It's hot water, right?

799
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,080
Well,

800
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,750
when hot water cools,

801
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,110
its volume decreases

802
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,880
and creates a vacuum in the cup,

803
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,750
making it

804
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,560
hard to open.

805
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,920
Can you help me open it?

806
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,510
Sure.

807
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:32,630
Thank you.

808
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:33,670
You're welcome.

809
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:47,500
(Yingmo Community)

810
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,680
Why isn't my baby back yet?

811
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:50,870
It's dinner time.

812
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,840
Dinner's ready.

813
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:55,030
Does it look good, honey?

814
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,720
Well, it fits.

815
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,200
You have so many clothes.

816
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,400
Why are you wearing Jiayue's?

817
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,400
- I like it.
- I'm back.

818
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,790
Baby, you're back.

819
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:07,950
Mom.

820
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,030
Why are you wearing my clothes?

821
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,670
I was just asking her that.

822
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,800
For the Model Family Competition,

823
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,030
I want to sing Heart Rain,

824
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:17,440
and a white dress suits the song.

825
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,590
It's more elegant,

826
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,430
right?

827
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,800
Jiayue, why are you home so late?

828
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,670
Honey, I told you she was

829
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,840
running for the class leader.

830
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,690
After she got elected,

831
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:28,230
she needed to have a meeting
with everyone, right?

832
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,550
Miss Class Leader.

833
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,590
I wasn't elected.

834
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,630
Not elected?

835
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,110
Well,

836
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,630
it's not a big deal.

837
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,000
It's okay.

838
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,760
Baby, then

839
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,800
who became the class leader?

840
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:53,470
Meng.

841
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,280
We invited

842
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,840
Brother Xiao Han over.

843
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,550
He'll help you
improve your study attitude

844
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,840
and teach you some study methods.

845
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,510
Listen carefully, okay?

846
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,510
Got it.

847
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,320
Xiao Han,

848
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,320
thank you.

849
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,200
It's okay.

850
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,320
Listen carefully.

851
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,920
Is there anything you don't understand?

852
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,710
Auntie, I'm thirsty.

853
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,190
Here, orange juice.

854
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,710
I don't want orange juice.

855
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,760
I want cola.

856
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,230
Don't drink cola.

857
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,590
That's a carbonated drink.

858
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,680
Have orange juice.

859
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,000
I don't care. I want cola.

860
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,110
We have guests today.

861
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,840
Let him have cola this time.

862
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,120
Auntie Guan,

863
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:53,990
two cans, please.

864
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,480
One for Xiao Han.

865
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,430
Okay.

866
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,960
You're the servant's son?

867
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,320
I don't need your help.

868
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,760
The most votes?

869
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,110
Momo, you're amazing.

870
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,800
I didn't expect it.

871
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:23,480
I only wanted to support Qian Jiayue.

872
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,720
You don't want

873
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,000
to be the class leader, right?

874
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,510
Otherwise, you'd definitely make it.

875
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:32,280
Chen, aren't you going to praise her?

876
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,800
For what?

877
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,190
I know her well.

878
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:38,550
First, she won their favors
with small gifts.

879
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:42,190
Then she said funny things
to make them laugh.

880
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:43,880
Got the most votes?

881
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,200
It's because

882
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,710
she's good at stirring up emotions.

883
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,710
No matter what,

884
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,030
facts are facts.

885
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,630
I did get the most votes.

886
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,470
Does it matter?

887
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:53,030
What's a student's main task?

888
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,710
It's to study.

889
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,030
Grades matter.

890
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:57,800
You failed two subjects

891
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,550
in the placement exam.

892
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,760
Why would they vote for you?

893
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:03,840
- Ridiculous.
- It's enough!

894
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,840
It's just a placement exam.

895
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,320
Stop saying it over and over again!

896
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,150
Exactly, stop bringing up the past.

897
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,600
Momo knows what to do.

898
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,350
Zhao Rongfang.

899
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,280
Come here.

900
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,430
Come on.

901
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,230
Check her backpack.

902
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,840
Look.

903
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,190
What are these?

904
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:29,910
Panda,

905
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,630
- rabbit,
- Ignore him.

906
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,590
and happy duck.

907
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,880
Let's see what's inside.

908
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,840
Tapes...

909
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,000
Don't go through my stuff!

910
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:39,960
Tapes,

911
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,680
comics...

912
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,920
Nothing about study.

913
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,800
Can you explain this?

914
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,550
Politics quiz...

915
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:10,400
Louder!

916
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:13,920
Politics...

917
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,710
quiz.

918
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,440
Four questions,

919
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,880
(Chen Pengyu)
solved one.

920
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:22,590
What's the signature next to the score?

921
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,030
Chen Pengyu.

922
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,670
Did I sign this?

923
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,710
Is my handwriting this bad?

924
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:29,350
You signed it?

925
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,150
- Who signed it?
- What are you doing?

926
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,440
Chen, you're freaking her out!

927
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:39,150
I thought she was just silly.

928
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,960
It turns out she's a bad girl.

929
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,800
She even forged my signature!

930
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,510
How dare you do this?

931
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,760
Chen, what are you doing?

932
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,030
Mom!

933
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,320
Look at her backpack...

934
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,550
Don't go through my stuff!

935
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:53,510
What's all this?

936
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,030
Check her backpack.

937
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,320
Check it.

938
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,720
Mom!

939
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:01,710
Did you focus on your studies?

940
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,480
You only

941
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,920
care about these junks!

942
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,710
As the saying goes,

943
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:11,100
a doting mother raises a spoiled child.

944
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,400
Your dear daughter

945
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,550
forged my signature this time.

946
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,600
What's next?

947
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:19,000
Next time, she might
set fire to a building

948
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,150
or rob a bank!

949
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,200
Enough!

950
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,510
You don't want a daughter like me,

951
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,950
and I don't want a dad like you!

952
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,010
Get out!

953
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,240
Momo...

954
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,150
Are you crazy?

955
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,240
Momo!

956
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:49,440
Xiao Han, come by more often.

957
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,320
Meng really likes you.

958
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,590
Mrs. Zhu,

959
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,800
are you sure
I don't need to clean the kitchen?

960
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,400
It's fine, just two bowls. I'll do it.

961
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,240
Go home early.

962
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,000
Han has homework to do.

963
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,280
- Sorry about that.
- It's okay.

964
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,230
Meng, you should learn from Brother Han,

965
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,440
okay?

966
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,280
I got it.

967
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,150
Great.

968
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:18,950
Who's this?

969
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:19,950
It's me.

970
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,240
Mr. Zhang.

971
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,590
- How rare.
- Sister-in-law.

972
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,710
Zhu, come here.

973
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:26,550
Mr. Zhang is here.

974
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,920
What brings you here

975
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,760
today?

976
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,230
You didn't like the tea I gave you?

977
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,710
I need to criticize you for that.

978
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,110
A phone call could've solved it.

979
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:35,230
Why did you send me gifts?

980
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,510
If I want tea, I can come here, right?

981
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:40,230
Han, you're here.

982
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,710
Han is Meng's tutor.

983
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,560
He came here to teach Meng.

984
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:45,910
Brother,

985
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,230
isn't Han amazing?

986
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,190
So handsome

987
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,110
and smart.

988
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,590
If Mao Tou were half as good,

989
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:51,800
I'd be over the moon.

990
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,640
Yes, that's right.

991
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,030
I didn't know

992
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,510
you knew each other so well.

993
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:57,070
I watched him grow up.

994
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,030
Aiping...

995
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,320
I've known her

996
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,190
since she was 17.

997
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,360
Yes, we're old neighbors.

998
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:05,030
Don't stand there.

999
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,360
Come on in. Come on.

1000
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:07,710
I'm not here for you.

1001
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,000
I'm here for Aiping.

1002
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,550
Aiping,

1003
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:11,960
I got the karaoke machine.

1004
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,320
Let's try it out.

1005
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:15,360
I also invited Xiu'e and others.

1006
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,020
I'm not going.

1007
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,630
Han, the Model Family Competition
is coming up.

1008
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,920
We're planning to sign up for it.

1009
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:28,560
I think we can team up.

1010
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,340
With you and Aiping,
we'll definitely win.

1011
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:31,510
She hasn't agreed.

1012
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,920
What do you think?

1013
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:36,870
Okay.

1014
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,920
Why not?

1015
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,190
I told you

1016
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,320
Han would agree.

1017
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,280
With you, we'll surely win.

1018
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,400
Hurry, let's go upstairs and practice.

1019
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:46,510
I need to do my homework.

1020
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,640
You guys go ahead.

1021
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,190
He assigned a task.

1022
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,190
Let's practice first.

1023
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,030
Okay, no problem.

1024
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,800
Okay.

1025
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:56,070
Goodbye.

1026
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,230
Keep it down.

1027
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,070
Don't disturb others.

1028
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:59,360
Thanks for the reminder.

1029
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,710
- Come next time.
- Finish by 10 p.m.

1030
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:01,630
See you next time.

1031
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:02,470
Goodbye.

1032
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,800
Honey,

1033
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,200
it's been a long time

1034
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,960
since we sang together, right?

1035
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,550
Nonsense, you're so forgetful.

1036
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:12,150
I often sing with you, okay?

1037
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,150
Baby, when we get to Mao Tou's place,

1038
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:16,000
can you sing a song?

1039
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,710
I don't sing.

1040
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:18,800
You're always in your room.

1041
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,000
You should relax sometimes.

1042
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,800
Mrs. Chen,

1043
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,960
why are you here?

1044
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,440
- Jiayue!
- Fangfang.

1045
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,280
Fangfang.

1046
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,280
Xiu'e!

1047
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:29,190
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

1048
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,800
Chen Mo

1049
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,630
ran away from home!

1050
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,960
Why are you here?

1051
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,590
It's late. You should go home.

1052
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:03,910
Chen Mo!

1053
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,840
- Chen Mo!
- Chen Mo!

1054
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:07,960
Let's go!

1055
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:09,800
- Chen Mo!
- What?

1056
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,320
Just go!

1057
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,160
- What?
- Hurry!

1058
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:13,550
Hurry! Go!

1059
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,160
Where are we going?
