(College Entrance Exam Study Plan)

25
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,140
Dad,

26
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,500
I don't want to transfer schools.

27
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,900
Xiao Han and I had a deal.

28
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,300
We'll try not to meet

29
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,260
before the College Entrance Exam.

30
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,220
(Focus on knowledge
in Grade 11 to make reviewing easier.)

31
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,020
He helped you

32
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,420
make this plan, right?

33
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,620
Can you complete

34
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,260
such a detailed plan?

35
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,000
Dad,

36
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,120
I admit,

37
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,080
I've never been a good daughter

38
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,800
as you imagined.

39
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,140
I used to

40
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,300
be upset,

41
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,700
but now I've realized

42
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,820
this is my own life.

43
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,260
I must take it seriously

44
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,820
and not let down

45
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,180
those who trust and support me,

46
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,820
especially you and Mom.

47
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,340
So,

48
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,510
I'll stay at No. 2 Middle School.

49
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,760
Believe it or not,

50
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,480
I will definitely try my best.

51
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,610
Come on.

52
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,300
Look.

53
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,100
Why are there only

54
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,380
English and Math in December?

55
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,740
What about Chinese?

56
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,060
Really? Let me see.

57
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:18,980
See for yourself.

58
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,020
Each month has its focus.

59
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,180
Next month, it'll be Chinese.

60
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,020
Look.

61
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,260
Look.

62
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,660
When's the Physics exam?

63
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,500
Have you figured it out?

64
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,460
In May.

65
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,740
It's written here.

66
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,700
Add Liberal Arts in Grade 12.

67
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,180
According to my plan,
I'll review Politics

68
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,580
this winter break.

69
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,700
Mom, you're back.

70
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,700
I bought groceries.

71
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,020
Hey,

72
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,540
don't expect yourself to be so diligent.

73
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,060
Winter break is yet to come.

74
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,420
Let's see how far

75
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,340
you can go

76
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,580
in this semester's final exams.

77
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,980
No problem.

78
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,300
Mom, did you hear that?

79
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,580
I won't transfer schools.

80
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,900
Dad agreed.

81
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,620
Is it true, Chen?

82
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,740
He always keeps his word.

83
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:20,620
Thanks, Dad.

84
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,380
Chen,

85
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,020
you figured it out?

86
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,580
Do I have a choice?

87
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,420
What are you waiting for?

88
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,380
Get my suitcase

89
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,220
back in the room.

90
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,540
I remember

91
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,740
someone is going to Qingpu.

92
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,660
What Qingpu?

93
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,140
Our daughter is entering Grade 12.

94
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,500
The next year and a half

95
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,260
is so important.

96
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,100
Besides,

97
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,140
can you

98
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,580
handle her alone?

99
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,980
I have to stay.

100
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,860
(My Friends, Reed)

101
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,420
(Reed)
You're finally online.

102
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,940
How have you been?

103
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,140
(Sailor)

104
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,940
(You're finally online.
How have you been?)

105
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,300
Not good.

106
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,420
Something happened.

107
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,140
I'm very upset.

108
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,300
(Zhang Qiming, No Entry)

109
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,020
Of course.

110
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,220
Right now,

111
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,340
you seem to be the only one
I can talk to.

112
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,020
My pleasure.

113
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,340
I don't even know where to start.

114
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,250
It's like

115
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,770
(Send Message)
my whole world collapsed.

116
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,770
I suddenly realized

117
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,610
everything was a lie.

118
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,650
I'm standing there alone

119
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,370
like a joke.

120
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:45,770
Is it that bad?

121
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,610
Her whole world collapsed.

122
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:59,770
What about me?

123
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,090
That's right.

124
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:04,770
What about me?

125
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,200
I'm here.

126
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,690
Actually,

127
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
maybe it's not your whole world.

128
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,760
Look back,

129
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,520
and you might find

130
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,880
sceneries you never noticed before.

131
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,160
It's time to say

132
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,520
goodbye to the old world

133
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,280
and embrace the new world.

134
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,220
Your words are always insightful.

135
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,860
I have much more to say.

136
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,260
Li Wenxiu

137
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,420
likes Su Pu so much.

138
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,780
Why doesn't she tell him?

139
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,880
Of course she can't.

140
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,380
At this point,

141
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,100
Su Pu already likes someone else.

142
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,820
Su Pu is a stubborn man.

143
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,660
If she tells him,

144
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,140
they won't even

145
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,780
be able to be friends.

146
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,290
It's better to maintain the status quo.

147
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,570
Her old world collapsed.

148
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:12,450
So,

149
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,250
can I

150
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,970
go back to her life now?

151
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,560
We've chatted online for so long.

152
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,320
Do you want to meet up?

153
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:40,740
(Zhang Qiming, No Entry)

154
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,740
Forget it.

155
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,620
Embrace the new world.

156
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,860
(Sailor: Actually, we've chatted online
for so long. Do you want to meet up?)

157
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,080
Sure.

158
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,320
Great!

159
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,480
Well,

160
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,480
how about tomorrow?

161
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,720
Tomorrow!

162
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,640
(Sailor)
How about tomorrow?

163
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,840
It's Sunday.

164
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,640
(Reed)
Maybe next week.

165
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,080
I have something to do tomorrow.

166
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,520

00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,140
We can switch seats.

194
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,660
We need to set some ground rules.

195
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:17,940
First,

196
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,620
don't talk to me during class.

197
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,220
Second, don't eat snacks.

198
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,020
Jiayue.

199
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,380
Your hair...

200
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,420
I thought it'd be more convenient,

201
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,260
so I cut it.

202
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,060
Are you feeling better?

203
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,780
Much better.

204
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,340
- Well...
- Xiao Han.

205
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,380
I have to go.

206
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,420
This year's Hope Cup Math Competition

207
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,260
is coming up.

208
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,660
Do you want to sign up with me?

209
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,620
I'm not on the team.

210
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,060
You don't need to.

211
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,260
Anyone can sign up.

212
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,660
If you win first or second prizes,

213
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,460
it'll help with
your university application.

214
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,620
I also want to go to

215
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,780
Jiao Tong University.

216
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,660
What do you think?

217
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,580
I think

218
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,660
you should

219
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,580
discuss it with your parents

220
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,060
or your teacher

221
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,420
instead of me.

222
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,420
Xiao Han,

223
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,980
I've wanted to tell you this.

224
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,820
Go ahead.

225
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,620
Don't hang out with
those people in Class 5.

226
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,340
What do you mean?

227
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:51,980
We're all

228
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,980
in the same school

229
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,260
by chance.

230
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,540
It's like where you were born

231
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,340
and who your neighbors or relatives are.

232
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,420
It's all by chance.

233
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,660
However, people will

234
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,420
go to universities of different levels

235
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,220
and have different

236
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,700
visions, friends, and ambitions.

237
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,940
You'll have no common ground anymore.

238
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,580
What's the point of wasting

239
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,780
so much time at this stage?

240
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,620
Give it to me straight.

241
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,980
I'll make it clear.

242
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,420
The girls in Class 5, such as

243
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,540
Qian Jiayue and Chen Mo,

244
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,380
have been bothering you.

245
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,260
- It's distracting, isn't it?
- Let me be clear.

246
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,140
You shouldn't waste time on me.

247
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,980
Meet an online friend?

248
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,580
As you know,

249
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,140
I've been chatting with Sailor

250
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,620
online for a long time.

251
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,700
We had a deal.

252
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,740
We'll hold The Catcher in the Rye
so that

253
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,980
we can recognize each other.

254
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,260
(The Catcher in the Rye)

255
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:30,980
(The Catcher in the Rye)

256
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,030
At home and in Qiming's car,

257
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,910
I've been telling you

258
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,070
I don't have any illness.

259
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,310
Why see a doctor?

260
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,910
It's not an illness.

261
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,030
Aren't you dizzy?

262
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,190
So, we came here

263
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,990
to do a physical examination.

264
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:44,910
Ask Little San, right?

265
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,390
Auntie, I'm sure you're fine.

266
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,670
But it's not

267
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,510
up to us.

268
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,430
We need to hear it

269
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:50,430
from the doctor.

270
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,870
- Just a check.
- You're so annoying.

271
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:52,710
Don't worry.

272
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,430
You look great today.

273
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,590
I need to go to the bathroom.

274
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,430
Bathroom?

275
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:00,150
Over there.

276
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,110
There.

277
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,350
- Okay, go ahead.
- Be careful.

278
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,790
The floor might be slippery.

279
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,870
Okay, I'll go with her.

280
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,710
Okay.

281
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,310
Seeing a doctor is expensive.

282
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,870
Mom, I'll wait outside.

283
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:29,950
Mom?

284
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,590
Mom?

285
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:41,180
(Quiet Please. Keep Silence.)

286
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,020
Why didn't she

287
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,340
wait for me?

288
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:52,780
Zhang Qiming.

289
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,500
Isn't she with you?

290
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,660
Didn't she go to the restroom
with you?

291
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,660
What? I waited for her

292
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,300
outside the bathroom but didn't see her.

293
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,780
I thought she was with you.

294
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,660
I didn't see her on my way here.

295
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,300
I'll go check again.

296
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,140
Mom?

297
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,260
Mom?

298
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,780
There's no one in the bathroom.

299
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,900
Should we split up?

300
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,020
Well...

301
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,220
- I'll go there.
- Call me if you find her.

302
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,740
See you at the registration desk.

303
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:31,900
Got it, got it.

304
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:32,940
Auntie.

305
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,140
Mom!

306
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,860
(Information Desk)
Excuse me,

307
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,900
have you seen an elderly lady

308
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,540
with gray hair and a gray coat?

309
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,380
An elderly lady.

310
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,300
Too many people. I didn't notice.

311
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,580
Why don't you check over there?

312
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,500
Thank you.

(Jiale Wontons)
Don't panic.

317
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,860
Where should we go first?

318
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,060
I'll check the committee.

319
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,380
I'll go to the store.

320
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,220
Okay.

321
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,100
Uncle Wang,

322
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,460
have you seen Chairwoman Liao?

323
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,020
I haven't seen her all day.

324
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,660
Director Zhao,

325
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,180
have you seen Chairwoman Liao?

326
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,220
I haven't seen her today.

327
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,260
Is something wrong?

328
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,500
She's missing.

329
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,180
Let us know if you see her.

330
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,460
Okay.

331
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:33,860
Did you find her?

332
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,700
No.

333
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,860
I'll search outside New Village.

334
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,180
I'll keep looking.

337
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,300
When did she go missing?

338
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,300
Around...

339
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,340
It was

340
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,860
around 9 a.m.

341
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,140
or 10 a.m. She...

342
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,900
is about this tall.

343
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,260
She's just an ordinary old lady.

344
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,300
And she's

345
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,620
not too fat or thin.

346

What happened?

00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,060
I just got the call.

Today, your mom and Mr. Zhang

370
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,100
took her to see a doctor.

371
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,100

372
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,820
and Granny went missing.

373
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,020
See a doctor?

374
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,700
For what?

375
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,300
Why should she see a doctor?

377
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,180

Did you find her?

383
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:53,980
Not yet.

384
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,540
Didn't find her.

385
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,500
I asked

386
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,860
the old neighbors.

387
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:58,980
They haven't seen her.

388
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,140
It's my fault.

389
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,420
I didn't take this illness

390
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,900
seriously.

391
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,780
It's not your fault.

392
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,780
A kind person like her is blessed.

393
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,060
We'll definitely find her.

394
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,860
We printed some missing posters.

395
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,980
Take a look.

396
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,620
If it's not enough, we can print more.

397
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,300
Let's split up.

398
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,580
(Missing Person - Liao Dongmei)
Go to the New Village,

399
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,740
and we'll go to the hospital
and the bus station.

400
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,500
Mrs. Qian.

401
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,500
I asked Lu Yao.

402
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,260
The TV station can also report it.

403
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,660
He'll ask them

404
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,860
when it will be reported.

405
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,660
It's almost been a day.

406
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,500
Did something happen to her?

407
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,580
No! Nothing happened.

408
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,740
What could possibly happen?

409
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,500
If something happened,
the police would know.

410
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,700
If they knew,

411
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,980
Officer Liu would call me.

412
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,300
I haven't got any calls.

413
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,380
(Call: Police Station)
The police.

414
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,620
Pick up.

415
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:02,980
Pick up.

416
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,700
Hello, Officer Liu.

417
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,100
Officer Liu?

418
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,540
Xiu'e!

419
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:11,940
Don't worry.

420
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,020
What?

421
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:14,980
You found her?

422
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,180
They found her!

423
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,860
They found her, Xiu'e!

424
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,260
Okay. I'm coming!

425
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,180
- It's okay.
- Thanks, Officer.

426
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,900
Okay.

427
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,260
- Where is she?
- They found her.

428
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,700
At the North Station.

429
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,020
Hurry up.

430
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,340
Auntie.

431
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,780
Has the train arrived?

432
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:41,900
Not yet.

433
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,980
It's cold outside.
Let's wait in the car.

434
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,500
We've called your family.

435
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,540
They're coming.

436
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,140
My family?

437
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,980
That's impossible.

438
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,460
None of them are here.

439
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,540
My daughter

440
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,620
Chen Xiu'e

441
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,980
just went to Jiangxi.

442
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,660
They all went there.

443
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,540
She won't return so soon.

444
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,140
Who are you waiting for?

445
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,900
I bought a platform ticket.

446
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,300
I'm waiting for my husband Chen Dehong.

447
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,500
He's supporting the development

448
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,340
of Guizhou.

449
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,500
He's an electromechanical worker.

450
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,260
It's exhausting.

451
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,260
He only comes back once a year.

452
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,180
He wrote to me

453
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,220
that he wanted to eat Butterfly Crisp.

454
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,660
He can't find it in Guizhou.

455
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,780
I bought it and put it here.

456
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,500
When the train comes,
I'll give it to him.

457
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,380
Where's my Butterfly Crisp?

458
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,140
Where is it?

459
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,780
- Auntie.
- Where is it?

460
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,100
I just put it here.

461
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,500
We'll help you. Don't worry.

462
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,860
- We'll help you.
- Auntie.

463
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,940
- I just...
- Auntie.

464
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,940
Don't worry.

465
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,100
- Mom!
- We'll help you.

466
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,620
Don't worry, we'll help you.

467
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,700
- Mom!
- Don't worry.

468
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,700
I've been looking for you!

469
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,740
You suddenly disappeared.

470
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,580
Where did you go?

471
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,460
Who are you?

472
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,780
- Help!
- It's okay.

473
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,140
Mom, I'm Chen Xiu'e!

474
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:05,620
Chen Xiu'e?

475
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,700
My daughter?

476
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,060
You're lying.

477
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,140
Chen Xiu'e went to Jiangxi.

478
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,460
She just left.

479
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,740
She doesn't know her.

480
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,180
Before she went to Jiangxi,

481
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,740
I put five hard-boiled eggs

482
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,580
and some White Rabbit milk candy

483
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,380
in her cotton quilt.

484
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,460
She didn't know.

485
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,700
If she knew, she'd throw them away.

486
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,540
She wouldn't want it.

487
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,180
She was mad at me.

488
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,500
Don't tell her.

489
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,580
Please don't tell her.

490
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,220
We won't tell her.

491
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,340
Mom, please stop, okay?

492
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,380
We're so worried.

493
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,220
Just go back.

494
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,260
Get off me.

495
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,500
- I don't know you.
- Go back!

496
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,380
It's been a day.

497
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,180
Where am I going?

498
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,260
Go home!

499
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,740
- No!
- Go home!

500
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,940
I don't want to go back.

501
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,020
Mom, stop.

502
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,340
I'm waiting for my husband

503
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,540
Chen Dehong.

504
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,460
I can only see him once a year.

505
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,100
I can't miss it!

506
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,220
Our three kids

507
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,260
are all waiting for him!

508
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,860
Mom, please stop!

509
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,860
Let's go back!

510
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,060
- Auntie!
- Mom!

511
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,740
I'm not your mom! I'm not!

512
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,100
I'm not!

513
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,300
Get off me!

514
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,580
I'm not your mom!

515
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,380
Stop it, Mom!

516
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,740
I'm not your mom.

517
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,700
You're so annoying.

518
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,540
Chairwoman Liao!

519
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,540
You know me?

520
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,020
Yes, I do.

521
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,340
You're Liao Dongmei
from No. 9 Factory, right?

522
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:50,860
That's right.

523
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:52,780
Chairwoman Liao,

524
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,300
here's the thing.

525
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,380
Her mom is outside
and won't go back.

526
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,700
No one can persuade her.

527
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,780
You're the chairwoman.

528
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,700
Can you persuade her?

529
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,940
She'll definitely listen to you.

530
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,780
Yes.

531
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,580
Your mom won't go home?

532
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,860
Don't worry.

533
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,740
I'll take care of it.

534
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,060
No mother would refuse to go home.

535
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,300
No mother would abandon

536
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,700
her daughter.

537
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,540
Understand?

538
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,380
Let's

539
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,940
help her find her mom, okay?

540
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,100
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.

541
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,980
- Let's persuade her, okay?
- Okay.

542
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,060
Okay.

543
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,100
Come on, I'll take you there.

544
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,220
Sorry for the trouble.

545
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,940
- Thank you so much.
- Keep in touch.

546
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,300
We must give you a banner.

547
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,980
Thank you so much.

548
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,900
Jiayue, don't worry.

549
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,460
Granny will be back soon.

550
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,380
Brother Xiao Han.

551
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,020
Mao Tou.

552
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,620
Hasn't she arrived?

553
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:01,550
Where did you go today?

554
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,590
I couldn't find you.

555
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,990
I went to my classmate's place.

556
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:09,190
I got a call from Dad when I got home.

557
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:10,950
Don't worry, Jiayue.

558
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:11,790
They found God-grandma.

559
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:12,910
She'll be fine.

560
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,430
It's okay.

561
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,030
If she's sick, she'll see a doctor.

562
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,310
She'll get better.

563
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,350
Don't worry.

564
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,070
Over there.

565
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,150
Granny!

566
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,390
Granny, Granny!

567
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,910
Granny!

568
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:29,870
Granny?

569
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:31,550
Jiayue,

570
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:32,870
she's still emotional.

571
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:33,870
Don't scare her.

572
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:46,310
I know this place well.

573
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:48,990
Have I been here?

00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:50,910
Have I?

575
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:53,950
Yes, you have.

577
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,510

645
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,380
maybe our classmates

646
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,980
should celebrate your birthday together.

strive to excel,

658
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:01,260

from the camphor box to dry them?

670
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,700

673
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,420
did you buy a ticket?

674
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:02,900
What ticket?

675
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,180
You need a platform ticket

676
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,460
to enter the station.

677
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,300
Do you want to skip the ticket?

678
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,340

679
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,860

680
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,660

Who

682
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:20,780
sells tickets here?

683
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,820
Ticket seller?

684
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,620
I'm buying a ticket.

685
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,260
I'm buying a platform ticket.

686
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,060
Hello.

687
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,120
- Honey.
- I'll give you money.

688
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,120
I want a platform ticket.

689
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,200
Why is she so weird?

690
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,960
She has a bad temper.

691
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,800
Traffic jam.

692
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,560
I'll take over from here. Give it to me.

693
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,720
I'm not going today.

694
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,280
She didn't ask me to buy a ticket today.

695
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,560
She'll get upset again.

696
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,440
I shouldn't leave.

697
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,800

698
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,320
to hang out. Go ahead.

699
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,480
For the past six months,

700
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,360
you've been with her 24 hours a day.

701
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,880
You need some fresh air.

702
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,880
You quit your job six months ago.

703
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,480
You need to go out.

704
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,400
Put on some nice clothes.

705
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,320
I can handle this.

706
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,800
Get changed. Come on.

707
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,760
Honey.

708
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,160
Go ahead.

709
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,200
She's grumpy. Talk to her nicely.

710
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,160

711
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:33,920
What's wrong?

712
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,680
That maid

713
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,480
is unreliable.

714
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,080
She just lied to me.

715
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,760
How did she lie to you?

716
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,520
She said that person
was a ticket seller.

717
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,480
She looks so old.

718
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,520
She's already retired.

719
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,160

720
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,920
Don't let her fool you.

721
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,600
No, I won't.

722
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,880
Okay, I got it.

723
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,880
Do you have a car?

724
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,520
Yes, I do.

725
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,360
Can you take me to the station?

726
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,560
I need to wait for my husband.

727
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,400

How did you know?

736
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,820
Didn't you write it in your QQ profile?

737
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,260
Do you know?

738
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,460
Your birthstone is a moonstone.

739
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,820
Didn't you say your world collapsed,

740
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,820
and you had bad luck?

741
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:55,580
If someone gives you a lucky birthstone,

742
00:38:55,820 --> 00:39:00,220
you must cherish it.

743
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:02,860
You must cherish it.

Mrs...

746
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,460
Mrs. Qian told me

747
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,740
Jiayue's granny

748
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,300
isn't in good health.

749
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,500
As for Jiayue's birthday party,

750
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,780
it shouldn't be too loud.

751
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,540
She still believes in

752
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,620
these superstitious things.

753
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,260
But Qian Jiayue argued with her mom.

754
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,580
But you know,

755
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,340
- she...
- It's okay, Ka Men.

756
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,980
I'll buy a gift.

757
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,060
Can you take it to her?

758
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,620
Okay.

759
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,900
Is it appropriate?

760
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,820
Of course.

761
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,300
Why wouldn't it be?

762
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:46,780
Listen.

763
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,300
If Qian Jiayue

764
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,860
receives a gift,

765
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,700
she'll act calm

766
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:52,700
and keep quiet,

767
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,540
but deep down,

768
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,020
she'll be happy.

769
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,420
- Really?
- Yes.

770
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,900
Then

771
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,340
I'll ask her out,

772
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,900
and we can...

773
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,100
What do you want to do?

774
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,500
Take photo stickers.

775
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,180
Okay, then we'll watch a movie
and drink milk tea.

776
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,820
Let's take a photo sticker now,

777
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:09,660
okay?

778
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,340
Hello, Miss,

779
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,220
do you have moonstones?

780
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,220
Moonstones? Yes, I do.

781
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,660
Will this bring luck

782
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:27,860
for June?

783
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,180
Yes, is it for yourself or someone else?

784
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,820
For someone else.

785
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,500
For a girl?

786
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,460
Here you are.

787
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,500
Look, it has a blue tint.

788
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:47,260
