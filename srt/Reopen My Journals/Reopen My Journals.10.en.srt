I forgot.

62
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,120
I saw you from afar.

63
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,960
What a coincidence.

64
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,120
Why are you here?

65
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,750
I just finished developing photos.

66
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,120

What happened to your hand?

69
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,710
My dad was chasing me,

70
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,280
and I accidentally fell.

71
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,360
What did you do?

72
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,800
I cut his hair.

73
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,030
He often asked my mom

74
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,070
to take me to get those

75
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,680
ugly short haircuts,

76
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,830
saying my looks
would affect my studies.

77
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,040
So I give him

78
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,480
an ugly haircut.

79
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,320
Look.

80
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,870
Impressive.

81
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,240
Why did you buy groceries yourself?

82
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,870
It's my mom's birthday today.

83
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,270
I want to cook a meal for her
to celebrate.

84
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,070
You really are a great son.

85
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,070
I hope my mom can truly be happy.

86
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,720
She will definitely be happy.

87
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,360
If I cooked a meal for my parents,

88
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,630
my mom would be moved to tears.

89
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,120

but can you promise not to tell anyone?

93
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,870
I won't even tell my mom.

97
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,560

98
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,150
right?

99
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,790
It's not like that.

101
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,000

00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,120
Mao Tou's dad isn't good enough,

107
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,310
or do you think

108
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,630
no one but your dad

109
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,000
is worthy of your mom?

110

111
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,040
your dad was a hero,

have you ever thought

117
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,560
she might feel lonely

118

119
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,750

120
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,750

212

243
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,150
I packed a few dishes

244
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,200
and got a big cake
from International Hotel.

245
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,270
Why did you buy a cake?

246

It's too much even for

250
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,000
the four of us.

251
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,360
We can surely finish it.

252
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,600
They're growing.

253
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,870
They can eat an entire cow.

254
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,270
Gone in an instant, right?

255
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,120
We're are the deliverymen.

256
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,910
Han, we just want
to deliver some dishes.

257
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,000

Let's have dinner.

275
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,750
The noodles

276
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,630

277
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,630

Five minutes.

287
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,440
Any underlying disease?

288
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,960
I don't think so.

289
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,790
High blood pressure.

290
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,350
It's usually around 140.

291
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,550
She's been taking
Zhenju Hypertension Tablets.

292
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,200
Her blood pressure is fine.

293
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,070
As for the blood test,

294
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,160
she has mild anemia

295
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,000
and malnutrition.

296
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,830
Is she usually stressed?

297
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Is her work tiring?

298
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,400
Yes, quite stressful and tiring.

299
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:55,680
She has two jobs.

300
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,880
I'll give her a sedative infusion

301
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,840
and see what happens.

302
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,880
As her husband and her son,
you should care about her.

303
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,350
With her health condition,

304
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,680
she can't work two jobs.

305
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,070
Are you guys ashamed?

Well,

311
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,750
is the infusion going a bit fast?

312
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,350
It's too fast. She can't handle it.

313
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:44,790
Alright.

314
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,630

381
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,720
When you're in high school,

382
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,200
you can use my computer.

383
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,400
Okay, Thank you in advance.

384
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:52,480
Brother Xiao Han said
there's a beauty at school.

385
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,000
Chen Mo?

386
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,550
Does Brother Xiao Han know her?

387
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,440
Brother Xiao Han,

388
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,440
gave you one, didn't he?

389
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,280
Did you lose it?

390
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,350
No wonder you're upset.

391
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,300
Mind your own business.

392
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,980
(Shanghai Puyang Central Hospital)

393
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,510
A doctor's handwriting

394
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,830
is the hardest to decipher.

395
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,000
Han.

396
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,240
Have some food.

397
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,160
You skipped dinner.

398
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,440
After this bottle, there are two more.

399
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,960
At least two hours to go.

400
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,440
Your 16th birthday
is coming up next month.

401
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:15,590
You're not a kid anymore.

402
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,200
There's something
I've wanted to tell you,

403
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,680
but your mom wouldn't let me.

404
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,550
She's afraid you'll get upset.

405
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,750
Let's put aside your reaction.

406
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,830
I think

407
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,080
at least

408
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:30,870
you have the right to know,

409
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,430
right?

410
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:35,550
Let's have a word.

411
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:46,060
(Emergency Room)

412
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,040
It's cold out.

413
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,350
Have my jacket.

414
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,000
I'm not cold.

415
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:56,960
It's quite warm inside.

416
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,350
Why come out here?

417
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,750
Too crowded in there.

418
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,310
I don't want people to hear.

419
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:04,880
You know what I mean?

420
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,610
Family scandals stay in the family.

421
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,040
Family scandal?

422
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,200
Yes, it is.

423
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,790
How should I start?

424
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,880
Guan Aiping joined our factory
at the age of 17,

425
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,480
just one year older than you are now.

426
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,030
When she came,

427
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:26,070
she had beautiful braided hair.

428
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,000
The fellows were so excited.

429
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,790
"What a beautiful girl!"

430
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,480
I ran to her workshop

431
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,880
and saw her.

432
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,400
Wow, she was

433
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,440
incredibly pretty,

434
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,030
and I fell in love.

435
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,070
However,

436
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,790
I didn't know what she liked.

437
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,030
No matter what I gave her,
she ignored me.

438
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,920
The way she looked at me

439
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,550
was just like you.

440
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,000
Later on,

441
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,880
Youguang came,

442
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,830
and I lost my chance.

443
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,480
Honestly, back then,

444
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:04,110
your parents were a perfect match.

445
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,510
Both pretty and capable.

446
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,790
When they walked through the factory,

447
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,240
we all turned around

448
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,920
just to see them.

449
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,760
So,

450
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,840
what happened next?

451
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,240
Then you were born,

452
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,030
and Mao Tou was born too.

453
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,870
(Emergency Room)
You little imps

454
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,640
came into this bustling world.

455
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,240
I hung out and had fun every day,

456
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,960
while your dad worked hard

457
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,640
and even got into a college.

458
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,510
Back then, things were

459
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:35,630
pretty good.

460
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,310
Then Youguang had an accident

461
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,270
and passed away.

462
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,520
You and your mom

463
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,960
moved into
the Yingmo Community.

464
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:47,550
Honestly, at that time, I really thought

465
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,030
it was hard for your mom

466
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,830
to raise you alone.

467
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,790
It wasn't just me.

468
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,960
All the fellows at No. 9 Factory
felt that way.

469
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,640
We respected your dad

470
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,350
and felt sorry for your mom.

471
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,270
We really cared about her

472
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,590
as her friends.

473
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,960
Later on,

474
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,650
the factory went downhills,

475
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,350
and those smart people

476
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,920
began to find another living.

477
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,200
Mao Tou's mom went to Japan
at that time.

478
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,200
She left,

479
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,350
met someone, and never returned.

480
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,480
As for me,

481
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,720
I just gave up on myself.

482
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,240
I drank and played cards.

483
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,310
I gambled

484
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,920
and got into fights.

485
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,310
A total mess.

486
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,920
One time, I played cards all night

487
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,880
and lost all my money.

488
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,270
I couldn't even afford a bowl of
rice served in soup.

489
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,440
I had no choice but to go home.

490
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,160
When I reached the doorstep,

491
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,400
I just didn't want to go in.

492
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,800
Later,

493
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,070
I just squatted

494
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,590
by the flowerbed.

495
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,200
Then,

496
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,440
your mom came downstairs,

497
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,350
grocery shopping,

498
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,190
and she saw me.

499
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,440
She kept staring at me,

500
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,030
I felt so embarrassed.

501
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,080
Zhang Qiming,

502
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,510
why are you sitting here?

503
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,070
I lost

504
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,720
the key.

505
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,720
Get up,

506
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,920
I'll buy you wontons.

507
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,310
When I was doing business,

508
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,720
I traveled to many places.

509
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,640
I lived everywhere.

510
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,550
Bus stops,

511
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,790
train station benches,

512
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:56,960
in front of shops,

513
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,000
under the bridge...

514
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,880
The public toilets
in Dongbei had heating.

515
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,790
Otherwise, I would've frozen to death.

516
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,750
Parks won't do,
too many mosquitoes in summer.

517
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,750
I often thought

518
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,310
maybe

519
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,310
I'm really done for

520
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,310
this time.

521
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,550
Then I'd remember,

522
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,480
the wontons your mom bought for me

523
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,240
and what she said.

524
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,000
Zhang Qiming,

525
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,200
Mao Tou's mom has left.

526
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,400
Do you want him to lose his dad too?

527
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,640
Even as a woman, I can live well.

528
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,510
You're a grown man

529
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,850
with hands and feet.

530
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,240
Are you going to live like this?

531
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,830
I'll pay for the wontons,

532
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,920
but I hope you can repay me someday.

533
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,640
Honestly,

534
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,000
if it weren't for her,

535
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:25,160
I might not get to chat with you here.

536
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:33,980
(Emergency Room)

537
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:31,060
(Martyr Xiao Youguang,
A Role Model Like Lai Ning)

538
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,000
Han, do you know when your mom

539
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,240
(Emergency Room)

540
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,070
lost her job?

541
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:41,950
Two years ago.

542
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:44,270
In June.

543
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,400
She said the factory took special care of us,

544
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,510
so she was among the last ones.

545
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,920
She got laid off three years ago.

546
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,480
That's not true.

547
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,920
Three years ago, I was in Grade 9,

548
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,550
she went to work every day.

549
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,750
The factory was closed.

550
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,070
How could she work there?

551
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:06,480
She'd stayed by the Suzhou River

552
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,310
for an entire day.

553
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,590
Maybe you're still young.

554
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,550
You might not understand
what I'm saying.

555
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,840
At that time,

556
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,160
she looked at the factory.

557
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,270
It was in ruins

558
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,880
with locked gates.

559
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,480
Your mom joined the factory
at the age of 17.

560
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,680
She was the Red Flag Bearer every year.

561
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,510
But everything's gone.

562
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:30,880
It's all gone.

563
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:33,160
And she had to fake a smile every day,

564
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,790
telling you, "Han, I'm going to work."

565
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,160
Han, I know

566
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,400
you don't like me.

567
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,510
I'm not as good as your dad.

568
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,880
That's true. I admit it.

569
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,350
I really can't compare to your dad.

570
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,000
But...

571
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,840
Xiao Han,

572
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,400
please let me take care of Aiping,

573
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,800
okay?

574
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,280
Your mom is quite stubborn.

575
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,350
If you don't agree,

576
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,680
she won't agree.

577
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,640
Dad...

578
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,040
I'm sorry.

579
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:31,200
I didn't take good care of mom.

580
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:35,480
I thought if I'm a good son

581
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,680
who studies hard

582
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,680
and doesn't cause trouble,

583
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,480
I can take care of her.

584
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:46,950
But sometimes

585
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,720
I could be so powerless.

586
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,310
I want to get everything right,

587
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,750
but I really can't.

588
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:59,270
I really don't know what to do.

589
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,960
I remember the last thing
you told me.

590
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,560
You said,

591
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:08,070
"I'll protect the factory,

592
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,710
and you'll protect your mom."

593
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,350
Dad,

594
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,360
I failed.

595
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,190
I'm sorry.

596
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,320
But you'd want her to live

597
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,960
a happy life,

598
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,030
right?

599
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:45,980
(Martyr Xiao Youguang,
A Role Model Like Lai Ning)

600
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:54,340
(Puyang New Village)

601
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,200
Dad.

602
00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:59,090
Qing.

603
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,840
Come on.

604
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,510
Careful, it's hot.

605
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,600
The buns, over there.

606
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,280
Gui.

607
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,000
- Hello, audience of Sunny Club.
- Okay.

608
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I'm Lu Yao.

609
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,760
A new century and new millennium

610
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,600
is coming.

611
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,320
Many friends told me

612
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,360
they want to see it

613
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,550
as a fresh start

614
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,510
(Host, Lu Yao)
to change their lives,

615
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:20,960
such as getting better grades,

616
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:22,510
becoming stronger,

617
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,510
and making more friends.

618
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:28,000
I've heard at the dawn
of the new century,

619
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,880
(Host, Lu Yao)
the first person you talk to

620
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,760
will have a bond with you
for a century.

621
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,400
Mom, you haven't recovered.

622
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,670
No work today.

623
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,190
Got it.

624
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,280
Don't worry.

625
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:37,670
No need to cook dinner.

626
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:38,880
Mao Tou's dad said

627
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:40,400
he'd bring food today.

628
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,590
I'm going to school.

629
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,640
Mom.

630
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:58,550
Well,

631
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,710
ask him to smoke less.

632
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,800
When he's here, try not to smoke.

633
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,920
Smoking is bad for health.

634
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:39,150
Morning, Brother Xiao Han.

635
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,430
Morning, Jiayue.

636
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,150
Brother Xiao Han,

637
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,230
did you sleep well last night?

638
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:49,440
You seem a bit tired.

639
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,760
My mom didn't feel well.

640
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,000
We went to the hospital.

641
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,550
She didn't feel well?

642
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,960
Is she okay now?

643
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,800
She's okay.

644
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,710
She got better after the infusion.

645
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,360
That's good to hear.

646
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:06,110
Brother Xiao Han.

647
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:07,870
What's wrong?

648
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,710
I want to ask you,

649
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,550
did you listen to the radio?

650
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,360
Oh, the radio.

651
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:19,400
I was at the hospital and missed it.

652
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,070
Sorry.

653
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,440
What was I supposed to listen to?

654
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,920
I requested a song.

655
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,000
Just one song.

656
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,190
I got your message.

657
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,400
Thank you, Jiayue.

658
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:37,350
Let's go.

659
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,560
So sudden?

660
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,510
Mrs. Xiao passed out?

661
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,190
Is she okay now?

662
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,800
She's at home.

663
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:56,480
Brother Xiao Han said she was fine.

664
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,000
Why did everything happen
at the same time?

665
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,510
So, what's your next move?

666
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:04,550
Ka Men!

667
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,470
Looks kinda like you?

668
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,400
- Easy! Easy!
- Look like me?

669
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,710
Nonsense!

670
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:14,190
What is this? So childish.

671
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,440
This is just a sample.

672
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:16,580
It's the New Year's Eve.

673
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,110
I had a deal with Liu Jianfeng.

674
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,920
We'll sell the big ones at the Bund.

675
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,530
The stall owner next door gave me these.

676
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:25,120
He gave me two bags to sell.

677
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,590
We can keep all the money we make.

678
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,670
Are you selling inflatable toys?

679
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,760
Yes.

680
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,000
Why don't you join us?

681
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,680
- More people, more fun.
- Okay.

682
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,360
I can invite Xiao to join us.

683
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:35,390
Let's go together.

684
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:36,950
What time is it?

685
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,240
Jiayue, Ka Men,

686
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,230
let's go celebrate

687
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,190
the New Year together.

688
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:42,110
- Okay.
- You're right.

689
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:44,710
I'll ask my neighbor for two more bags.

690
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,110
Ask for more. We'll sell them all.

691
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,920
Come early. Don't bail on me.

692
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,920
Let me see the rest.

693
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,110
That place is crowded.

694
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:53,320
The TV host said the first person

695
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,070
you talk to in the New Year

696
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:57,670
will have a bond with you for a century.

697
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,230
Xiao Han is going tonight,

698
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,630
so seize this opportunity.

699
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,550
How?

700
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:13,990
Boyfriend?

701
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:17,550
What are you doing?

702
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,920
Are you slacking off?

703
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,710
I need to go to the TV station

704
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,110
for the New Year's Eve Gala.
I'm almost late.

705
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,360
They're waiting for my rehearsal.

706
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,710
- I have to go.
- Liu Songming.

707
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,630
Liu Songming!

708
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,070
Are you going out?

709
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:29,960
- I'm heading out.
- Bye.

710
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,280
Aiping.

711
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,160
Where's Aiping?

712
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,840
She's ill.

713
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,510
Zhang Qiming said she passed out,

714
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,350
so I gave her a day off.

715
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:39,550
She's ill?

716
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:40,470
Is it serious?

717
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:41,550
I have no idea.

718
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,880
What did I say?

719
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,960
The Millennium Bug is powerful.

720
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:48,320
I told her to stick a talisman,

721
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,160
but she didn't do it.

722
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,000
Now she's suffering.

723
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,440
Where did you put it?

724
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,630
Let me check it.

725
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,030
Over there.

726
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,710
I'm busy.

727
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:03,800
No time for the Millennium Bug.

728
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,800
Why are you so grumpy?

729
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:10,510
If you're busy,

730
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,150
ask Liu Dagui to help you.

731
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:13,150
Where did he go?

732
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,320
He's so impressive.

733
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,510
He's going to be on TV.

734
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,400
Pei, payment, please.

735
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,000
- Coming.
- Already eaten.

736
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,670
What TV show?

737
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,030
The New Year's Eve Gala.

738
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,510
The New Year's Eve Gala?

739
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,710
Is he going to be a star?

740
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,800
What star?

741
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:32,030
You know the amateur dance group, right?

742
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,030
One singer

743
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,960
and dozens of dancers.

744
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,190
- How much?
- 4.5 yuan.

745
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,710
People can't even see him.

746
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,230
Why is he so excited?

747
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,560
Handle the register.

748
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,000
I'll wipe the tables for you.

749
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,070
Go on.

750
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:48,710
Thank you so much.

751
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,960
Liu Songming went out,

752
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,150
and the kids are messing around.

753
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,190
She just called me and said they'd go to
the Bund for the New Year's Eve.

754
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,150
There are so many people.

755
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,630
Why do they have to go there?

756
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:01,510
Welcome.

757
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,960
Would you like some wontons?

758
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,680
Sure, sure.

759
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,400
Pei, listen,

760
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,110
you're out of touch.

761
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,320
Nowadays, kids

762
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,550
want to hang out

763
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:13,590
with their friends

764
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:14,630
and have some fun.

765
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,030
While I'm alone at home?

766
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,190
I also want to celebrate
the New Year's Eve.

767
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:22,000
Are you feeling jealous?

768
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:26,250
How about I stay with you?

769
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,800
I've got nothing to do at home.

770
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,400
Just waiting for the kids to come home.

771
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,000
Let's have some fun.

772
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:32,990
What do you think?

773
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,630
Don't you need to stay with Qian Kang?
Stop joking.

774
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,710
Qian Kang said

775
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,320
the business might go well tonight.

776
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,000
He plans to have more trips.

777
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,840
Auntie Huang.

778
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,480
That's great.

779
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,070
This morning,

780
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,760
Fangfang's husband
went on a business trip.

781
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,440
Why not invite her as well?

782
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,510
Sure, no problem.

783
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:55,960
Let's invite Aiping too.

784
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,810
We can play mahjong together.

785
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,150
Once we're done here,

786
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:01,760
I'll check on her.

787
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,960
Okay. Okay.

788
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:04,700
Have some wontons.

789
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,880
No need. I've already eaten.

790
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,880
- It's okay.
- You did?

791
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,480
Have a seat. What would you like?

792
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:11,710
We have wontons and noodles.

793
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,510
Aiping, I'm back.

794
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,670
I bought an old hen

795
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:18,880
from Small Pudong,

796
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:20,670
I'll make chicken soup for you.

797
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:23,510
You sneak,

798
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:24,350
you freaked me out!

799
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,840
You have the key?

800
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:28,710
How do you have the key?

801
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,340
Any problem?

802
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:31,670
She gave it to me this morning.

803
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:35,040
Why were you here this morning?

804
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:41,340
