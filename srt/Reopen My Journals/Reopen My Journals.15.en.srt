=Episode 15=

24
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,620
What Jiayue said isn't wrong.

25
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,620
Jiali's doing so well in school,

26
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,320
why not let her study?

27
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,050
Instead…

28
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:47,820
Sister.

29
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,490
Anyway, I think

30
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,290
it doesn't quite add up, Mom.

31
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,340
Then tell me,

32
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,620
what's right?

33
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,100
Well...

34
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,540
Sister, you don't understand.

35
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,690
You people from Shanghai
have your reasons,

36
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,010
and our family has our own rules.

37
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,220
So what you mean is,

38
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,290
you want Jiali to become

39
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,260
a servant to help her brother, right?

40
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,450
Is that the rule in your family?

41
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,060
Just because

42
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,570
Jiali is a girl?

43
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,480
Girls don't need to study.

44
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:25,330
They'll marry one day.

45
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,100
Boys and girls are equal nowadays.

46
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,570
It's always been like this.

47
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:29,570
Listen to me,

48
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:30,690
it's a new era now.

49
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,010
Girls also need to study.

50
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,940
Jiali has her own ideas.

51
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,580
Kang,

52
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,160
aren't you going to handle her?

53
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,380
Xiu'e!

54
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,180
I don't need handling.

55
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,380
I can handle myself.

56
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,980
Jiali and Jiayue are only

57
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,340
two months apart.

58
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,500
Look at Jiayue.

59
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,180
If she studies well

60
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,740
in high school and university,

61
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,140
she can do whatever she wants
in the future.

62
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,300
She can become a career woman,

63
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,500
a strong leader,

64
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,020
or even

65
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,380
fly airplanes

66
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,300
if she wants!

67
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,940
But Jiali?

68
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,540
If she starts working this early,

69
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,660
her future…

70
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,100
I can see it clearly
even with my eyes closed!

71
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,900
She's only 16,

72
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,060
just a little girl!

73
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,580
Mom, letting her work this early

74
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,700
is just…

75
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,540
Xiu'e.

76
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,120
This is our family matter,

77
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,840
it's not for you to interfere.

78
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,020
I just…

79
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:36,900
can't stand it.

80
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,740
I feel like

81
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,820
we shouldn't sacrifice Jiali's future!

82
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,500
Enough!

83
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,860
Stop talking!

84
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,220
On such a joyful day,

85
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,790
let me say a few words.

86
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,420
Dad.

87
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:54,900
Mom.

88
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,060
I'm the eldest son

89
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,180
but haven't been by your side

90
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,860
to show filial piety.

91
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,250
This glass

92
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,460
is to you!

93
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,440
Qian Lin, Qian Yu,

94
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,020
my sisters-in-law,

95
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,260
over the past year,

96
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,990
you've taken care of Mom and Dad

97
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,660
and supported the family.

98
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,260
This glass

99
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,300
is to you!

100
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,620
Kang, take it easy.

101
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,890
I always bear it in mind.

102
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:26,900
Jiali,

103
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,780
Weihao,

104
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,700
Weiye.

105
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,460
In the coming year, may you all

106
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,860
achieve higher grades

107
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,800
and become even better!

108
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,860
Kang, what...

109
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,300
what are you doing toasting to the kids?

110
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,100
I drink! They drink juice!

111
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,420
Come on.

112
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,570
Weihao, pick up your cup.

113
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,920
Clink it against your uncle's.

114
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,340
Cheers!

115
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,300
Drink less.

116
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,500
Don't worry, Mom!

117
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,380
Qian Lin,

118
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,620
my sister-in-law,

119
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,340
do you

120
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,830
really see me as your elder?

121
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,260
We do. We do!

122
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,100
Of course.

123
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,140
In this house,

124
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,220
besides Dad and Mom,

125
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,460
you're the oldest.

126
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,260
And even this house was built
with the money you sent!

127
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,220
A toast!

128
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,620
Since that's the case,

129
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,260
today, as your eldest brother,

130
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,520
I'll make a statement!

131
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,020
Jiali.

132
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,500
Qian Jiali,

133
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,880
you will not drop out of school!

134
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,540
Go back to school
and continue your studies,

135
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,380
understand?

136
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,220
Kang,

137
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,580
don't say something like that…

138
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,660
Aren't I the eldest brother?

139
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,820
Doesn't my word count?

140
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,780
Sure it does.

141
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:39,980
Qian Lin,

142
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,220
I'm telling you,

143
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,260
Jiali's high school tuition
for the next three years,

144
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,100
I'll pay for it!

145
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,700
Isn't that great?

146
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,300
This is great! Great!

147
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,380
Xiu'e!

148
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,740
Do you agree?

149
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,780
You're the head of the family!

150
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,100
I'll listen to you! I agree!

151
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,940
That's so nice of the eldest brother.

152
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,820
- That's so nice of him.
- Qian Lin,

153
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,280
do you have any other issues?

154
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,660
Dad,

155
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,660
look at him.

156
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,660
He's drunk!

157
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,460
I'm not drunk!

158
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,100
The times have changed!

159
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,620
Just trust me this once!

160
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,140
Girls

161
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,940
can have a good future too,

162
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,340
and can still be filial to you
in the future!

163
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,180
Lin,

164
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,540
your brother has been through

165
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,740
a lot outside these years.

166
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,820
He's sacrificed a lot

167
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,660
for our family.

168
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,260
He only has this one wish,

169
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,340
and I think

170
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,780
we should listen to him.

171
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,500
What do you think?

172
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,340
Great! Great!

173
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,620
Dad,

174
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,540
I toast to you!

175
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:55,940
Mom,

176
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:56,980
I toast to you!

177
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,980
Don't worry about me.

178
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,540
This time,

179
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:03,860
our family

180
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,980
will head back on the fifth.

181
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,780
I wish you both all the best

182
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,700
and good health! Cheers!

183
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,460
You're leaving on the fifth?

184
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,700
Didn't we agree on the seventh?

185
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,340
Mom,

186
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,620
Dad,

187
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,260
we originally said the seventh,

188
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,380
but Jiayue

189
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,080
has a thing on the sixth.

190
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,100
This trip back home

191
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,540
messed up her plans.

192
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,420
After thinking it over,

193
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:30,790
we decided to leave earlier.

194
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,720
Plus, the train tickets
are easier to get.

195
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,580
A toast!

196
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,380
You guys just got back,

197
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,740
stay for more days.

198
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,260
What could a little kid have to do?

199
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,220
Whatever,

200
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,380
it all matters to me.

201
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,790
- Yes!
- I'm the eldest son!

202
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,030
- Eldest brother...
- A toast to everyone!

203
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,460
Happy Chinese New Year!

204
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,220
Isn't this a bit rushed?

205
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,380
Mom, Happy Chinese New Year!

206
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,290
Here, Mom.

207
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,940
Thank you all!

208
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,300
Beautiful!

209
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,180
Eight Wan.

210
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,500
Eight Wan.

211
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,540
Another Wind!

212
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,020
I've drawn all the winds.
What terrible luck!

213
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,140
- I'll take a North Wind.
- Mom.

214
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,740
My stomach hurts.

215
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,860
Your stomach hurts again?

216
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,180
Did you catch a cold?

217
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,500
Medicine's in the drawer.

218
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,700
Nine Dots.

219
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,260
- Pong! Pong!
- South Wind.

220
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,460
Drink more hot water.

221
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,340
When your dad comes back,
he'll cook for you.

222
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,740
- It's your turn.
- Nine Wan.

223
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,800
Kong! Kong!

224
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,500
Are you trying to stop me from winning?

225
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,860
You really are something,

226
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,420
you don't give me any chances!

227
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,540
Play already! Play!

228
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,460
- Terrible.
- Seven Dots.

229
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,300
Pong!

230
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,460
Take better care of your health.

231
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,860
Make sure you eat on time.

232
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,580
Go ahead and eat.

233
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,620
Good, good!

234
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,500
- Watch TV.
- Okay.

235
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,700
So funny.

236
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,060
Hello?

237
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,090
They've got real skills.

238
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,540
That was the phone ring from the TV.

239
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,380
Silly!

240
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,740
Have you had the dinner?

241
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,300
I've had mine.

242
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,780
How's everything over there?

243
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,100
Cousin, it's me, Qian Lin! How are you?

244
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,060
When are you coming back?

245
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,820
Don't forget to take care

246
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,740
of yourself over there!

247
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,780
Okay, okay.

248
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,300
You go ahead. I'll hang up now.

249
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,340
Don't! I have a few more words to say.

250
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,580
Cousin! Cousin!

251
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,420
It's me, Qian Lin.

252
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,720
Got it,

253
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,980
I'll say hello for you.

254
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,460
You must take care of your health!

255
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,500
I miss you.

256
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,660
Okay, okay. Everything's fine.

257
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,380
I'm hanging up now.

258
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,380
I'll hang up.

259
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,740
She's busy, you know?

260
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,780
- Come, come.
- I miss my sister.

261
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,100
Oh, she'll be back next year.

262
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,380
Hello?

263
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:51,930
Good!

264
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,560
God-grandma.

265
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,060
It's for you.

266
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,260
Me? Who is it?

267
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,300
No idea.

268
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,140
Hello?

269
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:00,940
Oh, Wang.

270
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,540
Loong horse spirit.

271
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,700
Loong leaps, tiger pounces.

272
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,700
Loong…

273
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,030
Loong what?

274
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,080
Loong...

275
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,660
Loong flies and phoenix dances!

276
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,390
Loong and phoenix bring good luck.

277
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,460
How's that?

278
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,900
If you're so good,

279
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,580
say five more idioms
with "loong" in them.

280
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,290
I've already came up with a lot.

281
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,340
You want five more?

282
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,180
Momo,

283
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,220
stop hogging the phone.

284
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,060
Your dad needs to use it for work.

285
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,720
Otherwise, he'll complain
about you again.

286
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,540
Got it, Mom. You go ahead.

287
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,980
I'll hang up now.

288
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,580
Loner Xiao, may you

289
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,460
stop being a hypocrite this year,

290
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,780
and be a true villain instead.

291
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,180
You're the villain.

292
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,140
So…

293
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,660
let's

294
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:08,860
meet on the sixth.

295
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,620
Are you saying

296
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,260
we won't contact each other until then?

297
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,540
Then…

298
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,180
I'll call you tomorrow?

299
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,860
Tomorrow… I'll wait for your call.

300
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,780
Then…

301
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,540
bye-bye.

302
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,340
Bye-bye.

303
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,380
Isn't life like this?

304
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,780
A happy day is a day,

305
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,340
and a crying day is a day.

306
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:21,900
Right?

307
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,540
Anyway, it's one day,

308
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,580
you might as well

309
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,820
spend it happily.

310
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,060
Let me tell you…

311
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,320
Are you going to play cards?

312
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,500
No problem, go ahead and play. Okay.

313
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,590
Happy Chinese New Year!

314
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,500
Happy Chinese New Year.

315
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,340
We'll talk next time.

316
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,460
Mao Tou.

317
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,580
Really!

318
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,700
You ate so much!

319
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,820
You may get heatstroke!

320
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,660
Why don't you go downstairs
to see the firecrackers?

321
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,740
Your dad bought a lot.

322
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,940
I'm going to see.

323
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,820
Come on, let's go.

324
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:57,900
Let's go.

325
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,420
- Come on.
- God-grandma,

326
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,820
you go first.

327
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,740
I'll catch up.

328
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,020
I need to use the restroom.

329
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,540
- Be quick.
- Right away.

330
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,380
Hello?

331
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,500
Mao Tou?

332
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,300
Qian Jiayue!

333
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,030
What took you so long?

334
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,560
There were too many people.

335
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,420
I'm waiting for my turn.

336
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,500
So… is this your first call

337
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,940
of the New Year?

338
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,190
The first one that got through.

339
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,400
Happy Chinese New Year, Qian Jiayue!

340
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,060
Happy Chinese New Year!

341
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,030
Where's Granny and the others?

342
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,540
Your granny…

343
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,960
she went down
to watch fireworks.

344
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,660
I'll call her later.

345
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,140
- Bye.
- Wait…

346
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,340
Hello?

347
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,820
Hanging up so fast!

348
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,780
Jiali.

349
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,700
Hello?

350
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:06,980
Jiayue,

351
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,420
it's for you.

352
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,620
For me?

353
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,500
Yes.

354
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,300
Hello?

355
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,540
Hello?

356
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,940
Qian Jiayue.

357
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,220
Chang Wuji!

358
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,740
How did you get this number?

359
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,660
From your phone book…

360
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,180
Five, four,

361
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,620
(Jiangxi Home)
three, two, one.

362
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,940
Oh my god!

363
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,940
You only looked at it once,
and you remembered it!

364
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,460
That's amazing!

365
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,500
Hello. Good evening.

366
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,060
May I speak to Qian Jiayue?

367
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,180
Sorry, wrong number.

368
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:15,420
079383701... 6.

369
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,220
Is this

370
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,540
Qian Jiayue's home?

371
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,940
Sorry, sorry…

372
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,820
17.

373
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,020
Is this Qian Jiayue's home?

374
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,420
I dialed wrong.

375
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,820
18.

376
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,660
Qian Jiayue.

377
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,860
Happy Chinese New Year.

378
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,660
Thank you!

379
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,520
Happy Chinese New Year
to you too, Chang Wuji.

380
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,860
My sister is waiting to use the phone,

381
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,100
so I'll hang up now.

382
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:44,950
Bye-bye.

383
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,930
- Happy Chinese New Year!
- Happy Spring Festival!

384
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,260
Han,

385
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,260
I've prepared
the black sesame filling for you.

386
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,020
- I'm putting it in the fridge now.
- Okay.

387
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,690
The black sesame filling
is in the fridge.

388
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,300
The cold dishes are ready.

389
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,330
Do we need to beat it?

390
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,260
- You passed it.
- The soup's ready too.

391
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,180
Just hit it down.

392
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,860
The rice is still in the pot,

393
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,700
don't forget.

394
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,060
Okay, okay.

395
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,620
- Rice is in the pot.
- I've also

396
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,780
prepared drinks,

397
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,460
some are cold in the fridge.

398
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,010
But

399
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,700
what if you finish them?

400
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,620
I'll go get more money for you.

401
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,700
No need for more money.

402
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,620
We can just open a beverage factory.

403
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,100
You're so chatty.

404
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,540
Just stop worrying.

405
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,620
It's fine.

406
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,280
With us here,

407
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,900
the kids can't have fun.

408
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,140
Han,

409
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,740
the cake's over there.

410
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,100
- Okay.
- The candles are next to it.

411
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,900
The lighter's over there.

412
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,100
Be careful when lighting it,

413
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,340
don't press the button too long.

414
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,300
If you press too long,

415
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,980
- Okay, okay.
- the spark might fly out.

416
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,620
Don't burn yourself.

417
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,260
- Okay, okay.
- Are you done?

418
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,340
Hurry up.

419
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,940
Let's go.

420
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,620
Are we eating first or taking a walk?

421
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,710
Have fun!

422
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,220
- See you, see you.
- Bye-bye.

423
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,570
Be careful. Leave it to me.

424
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,280
They left.

425
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,820
Go on.

426
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,620
You're going over so early?

427
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,220
Qian Jiayue asked me
to go to her granny's

428
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,920
to bring two dishes
to Xiao Han's.

429
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:35,860
Don't you think

430
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,500
she should be showing some care

431
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,340
to Chang Wuji?

432
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,100
Chang Wuji?

433
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,060
Why him?

434
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,740
Don't act like you don't know.

435
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,390
But I think she's been
acting strange lately.

436
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,340
She likes Chang Wuji secretly,

437
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,360
but she doesn't even watch his matches.

438
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:56,900
Wait.

439
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,180
What?

440
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,260
Who told you it's Chang Wuji?

441
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,260
You told me

442
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,940
Qian Jiayue likes Chang Wuji secretly.

443
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,900
When did I say that?

444
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,420
You said Qian Jiayue
has a secret crush on a genius

445
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,660
who's not into romance.

446
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,580
Who?

447
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,900
A genius who's not into romance.

448
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,460
Qian Jiayue, invite Chang Wuji too.

449
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,380
Why don't we have Chang Wuji
join Qian Jiayue's team?

450
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,380
Chang Wuji,

451
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,020
why don't you walk Qian Jiayue home?

452
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,420
Bye-bye.

453
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,620
Bye-bye.

454
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,020
Go back!

455
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,060
You go first.

456
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:37,900
Oh my god!

457
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,580
That's how it is!

458
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,460
What is it?

459
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,000
Momo?

460
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,420
Momo?

461
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,940
Wait, my parents are back.
We'll talk later.

462
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:51,870
See you soon.

463
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:04,860
(Yingmo Community)

464
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,500
Grandma Chen?

465
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,590
I'm here for the food.

466
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,660
Chen Mo.

467
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,620
It's almost done.

468
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,540
Here are the shoes
just wait in the living room.

469
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,380
Got it.

470
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:16,820
By the way,

471
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,740
do you have any
double-sided tape or glue?

472
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,300
Sure, in Jiayue's room.

473
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,140
I'll go get it.

474
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,860
Dad! Mom!

475
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,100
Hurry up!

476
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,540
Hurry up!

477
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,700
Baby, don't run so fast.
Be careful not to fall.

478
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,980
Xiu'e, let her run.

479
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,540
She wants to see her friends

480
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,540
and celebrate.

481
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,100
- Go ahead.
- Then I'm going now!

482
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,740
The bag! Leave it to us!

483
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,020
It's fine.

484
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,020
Oh, I see.

485
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,340
Granny!

486
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,980
- I'm back!
- Baby!

487
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,500
Granny!

488
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,940
My baby's back!

489
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,060
Granny!

490
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,090
Let me take a look at you.

491
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,020
You've lost weight,
you didn't get to eat my cooking.

492
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:38,860
Qian Jiayue.

493
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,980
Chen Mo!

494
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,450
So glad I made it back!

495
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,980
Yeah, glad you made it back.

496
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,180
Granny, is the food ready?

497
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,420
It's being plated.

498
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,460
I'll drop

499
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,500
my bag and be right back.

500
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,460
Qian Jiayue!

501
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,380
I just remembered I have something to do,

502
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,780
so I'll skip it.

503
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,140
What's going on?

504
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,180
My stomach isn't feeling well,

505
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,340
I need a lie-down.

506
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,180
Is it serious?

507
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,140
Do you need medicine?

508
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,260
- We have some.
- No need.

509
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,620
Just need to lie down for a bit.

510
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,580
Tell Loner Xiao

511
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,740
happy birthday for me.

512
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,660
Are you sure you're okay?

513
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,380
Don't worry, my mom
works at the hospital.

514
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,940
I'm leaving now.

515
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,060
Enjoy yourselves.

516
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,300
Get some rest.

517
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,180
- Bye.
- Bye.

518
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,660
Baby, the dishes are ready.

519
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,500
Come.

520
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,220
Granny, give me second.

521
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,260
(Name strokes; Your fate with him/her)

522
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,180
Who told you it's Chang Wuji?

523
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,020
Qian.

524
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,540
Jia.

525
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,220
Yue.

526
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,340
Twenty-six.

527
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,940
Xiao Han, eighteen.

528
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,180
Forty-four.

529
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,060
(Destined to meet but not to be together)
Mine is four. What does that mean?

530
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,660
Destined to meet...

531
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,380
Destined to meet?

532
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,420
(Destined to meet but not to be together)
But not to be together.

533
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,460
Hi, Ka Men.

534
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,020
I was interrupted by my parents.

535
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,860
So, the Qian Jiayue's secret crush

536
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,260
is not Chang Wuji.

537
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,300
I thought about it…

538
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,660
It's her Brother Xiao Han, isn't it?

539
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,100
It is.

540
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,340
Ka Men,

541
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,700
look at this round flat cake.

542
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,540
Looks like your face.

543
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,060
Come on, make a tangyuan,

544
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,340
round and perfect. Here.

545
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,820
You call it perfect?

546
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,780
Then why is Late Chen still not here?

547
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,860
She's always late.

548
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,900
That's why we call her

549
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,820
Late Chen.

550
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,180
Being late is her thing.

551
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,980
She must've overslept.

552
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,020
Probably.

553
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,580
- She's here.
- Get the door.

554
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,460
I must criticize her this time.

555
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,060
- Absolutely.
- She needs to be scolded.

556
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:29,860
Jiayue?

557
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,740
Qian Jiayue!

558
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,820
Ka Men!

559
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,580
I rushed back today
to celebrate your birthday.

560
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,660
Are you happy?

561
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,260
Happy. Of course.

562
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,860
Didn't you say you couldn't make it?

563
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:42,820
Isn't surprise good?

564
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,100
Very good!

565
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,700
Brother Xiao Han,

566
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,020
Granny made your

567
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,380
favorite two dishes.

568
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,700
Thank Grandma Chen.

569
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,580
By the way, Chen Mo said

570
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,700
her stomach is a bit upset,

571
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,020
so she might not make it.

572
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,630
She asked me to
wish you happy birthday.

573
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,460
Is she okay?

574
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,020
She said she's fine,

575
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,820
just needs to lie down at home.

576
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,100
That's good.

577
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:08,360
Let's go inside quickly.

578
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:09,410
- Okay.
- Jiayue!

579
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,580
Happy Chinese New Year!

580
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,460
So polite.

581
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,260
Aren't we close?

582
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,700
Hey. Nice to meet you.

583
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,220
- I'm Wang Bin.
- Nice to meet you too.

584
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,700
I'm Liu Jianfeng.

585
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,420
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello, hello.

586
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,220
You just want to touch her hand.

587
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,060
Ka Men's not happy.

588
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,620
Brother Xiao Han!

589
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,100
I've prepared a

590
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,280
special birthday gift for you.

591
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,620
A special gift?

592
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,540
I couldn't bring it here.

593
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,900
I left it at Mao Tou's old house.

594
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,540
We can go after eating.

595
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,100
Sure, no problem.

596
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,420
- Okay.
- What is it?

597
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,380
You couldn't bring it?

598
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,620
Is it really that grand?

599
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,940
You'll know when you see it.

600
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,820
Then I must see it.

601
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:15,980
Coming.

602
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,060
Hi.

603
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,780
Why are you here?

604
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:30,900
I

605
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,380
heard your stomach was upset.

606
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,700
Feeling better now?

607
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,380
I'm fine now.

608
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,220
That's good.

609
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,190
I saved a piece

610
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,060
of birthday cake for you.

611
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,460
It's my stomach,

612
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,780
I can't eat it.

613
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,340
Didn't you say you felt better?

614
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,260
Anything else?

615
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,290
I…

616
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,500
Didn't you say you had

617
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,020
a special birthday gift for me?

618
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,700
That was just a random comment.

619
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:17,300
I didn't think of anything to give you.

620
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,700
Anyway…

621
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,580
I gave you a card,

622
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,780
right?

623
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,340
"A random comment"?

624
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,900
Chen Mo, you…

625
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,300
I'll leave then.

626
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,300
Three,

627
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,620
two,

628
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:29,660
one!

629
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,460
It's lit!

630
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:33,300
- How did they go there?
- So pretty.

631
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,180
This looks like…

632
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,640
a 3D galaxy?

633
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:36,790
Galaxy… shooting stars…

634
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:37,900
Yes! Shooting stars.

635
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,740
Brother Xiao Han.

636
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,100
What do you think?

637
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,220
Do you like it?

638
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,340
I do.

639
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,340
Thank you, Jiayue.

640
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,940
As long as you like it!

641
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,580
You're so happy?

642
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,740
I am!

643
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,420
Qian Jiayue.

644
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,940
If I tell you that I want to

645
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,220
go to No. 2 Middle School,

646
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,660
would you be as happy?

647
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,020
You?

648
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,900
Why did you suddenly want to

649
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,740
go to No. 2 Middle School?

650
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,660
Nevermind that.

651
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,500
Just tell me,

652
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,800
if I…

653
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,840
Qian Jiayue.

654
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,460
If I passed the exam,

655
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,660
I'll tell you something.

656
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,260
What is it?

657
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,100
You'll see.

658
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,420
Good luck then!

659
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,460
Did you set up my computer?

660
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,460
You just left?

661
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,380

Long time no see.

00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,220

Happy Chinese New Year.

Hi.

696

I've forgotten how we became friends.

697
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,740
I think I just searched casually

698
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,180
and found your name interesting.

699
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,660
Anyway, meeting is fate.

700
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,060
The teacher gave us this topic.

701
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,100
I don't want to sound childish,

702
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,940
so I'm asking you adults

703
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:38,980
for some advice.

704
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,740
How do you know I'm an adult?

705
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,340

you're 22.

707
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:56,860

No, of course not.

00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,460
Mrs. Qian.

758
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,260
You're just in time! For tutoring,

759
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,580
you should ask Xiao Han.

760
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,500
He's definitely more reliable
than Qian Jiayue.

761
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,180
He wants to enter your school,

762
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,060
and his enthusiasm hasn't cooled off yet.

763
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,300
But, not cooling off is a good thing.

764
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,500
Hang in there, Mao Tou.

765
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,020
That's right, it's a good thing.

766
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,820
Where do you want to start?

767
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:33,860
Let's go upstairs.

768
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,500
No, no. Well, Brother Xiao Han,

769
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,660
I… I...

770
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,980
I can study on my own!

771
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,740
It won't trouble you. You can go ahead

772
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,060
and get busy.

773
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,020
Godmother, I'm off.

774
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,740
That Mao Tou really is…

(Round 2: Chang Wuji vs. Yu Yao)
2367889910.

777
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,780
This is from
defending champion Chang Wuji.

778
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,820
Now, let's check

779
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,700
the answer from challenger,
university student Yu Yao.

780
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:08,780
2367889910.

781
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,820
Their answers are identical.

782
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,180
Now, let's check

783
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,300
the correct answer…

784
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,980
2367889910!

785
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,100
Both of them got it right!

786
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,940
We'll now move to

787
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,460
- the third extra round.
- Another tie!

788
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,820
Chang Wuji is amazing!

789
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,860
How did they remember it?

790
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,700
Only three seconds.

791
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,540
It's penalty now.

792
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:32,900
Be quiet!

793
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,980
Three, two, one.

794
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:35,940
Start!

795
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,420
End.

Finally, there's a difference.

803
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,220
Chang Wuji wrote thirteen digits,

804
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,420
while Yu Yao wrote

805
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,940
twelve digits.

806
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,180
Why do I feel like

807
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,460
there are only twelve digits?

808
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,530
Impossible. Did you see?

809
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:17,380
- The moment has come.
- Dunno!

810
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,660
- I also think it's twelve digits.
- Right?

811
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,500
Oh no.

812
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,300
It's okay, even if he lose.

813
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,460
Yu Yao is a university student,

814
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,740
while Chang Wuji is only fifteen.

815
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,180
Who is that amazing at fifteen?

816
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,350
- Right!
- The winner...

817
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,700
I've always felt

818
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,860
this competition is unfair.

819
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,980
It should be divided by age first, then…

820
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:32,890
- Enough.
- Let's see…

821
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:34,380
- She's gonna announce!
- The answer is…

822
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,140
1325698007754.

823
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,020
Yu Yao's answer missed one digit

824
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:43,940
and got one wrong,

825
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,820
while Chang Wuji's thirteen-digit answer…

826
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,180
is completely correct!

827
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,100
- Completely correct!
- Congratulations to Chang Wuji

828
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,460

832
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,980
The last round was really intense.

833
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,620
How do you feel now?

834
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,140
Not bad.

835
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,660
That's it?

836
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,900
Do you have anything to say

837
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,140
to the viewers at home?

838
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,220
Or anyone you want to thank?

Make sure you eat on time.

843
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,180
This is typical

844
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,450
Chang Wuji style.

845
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,380
Well then,

846
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:46,380
let's present the highly anticipated
annual grand prize.

847
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,020

two-bedroom apartment in Ruihong New Town)

850

A two-bedroom apartment

851
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,180
awarded to our young champion!

852
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,340
An apartment?

853
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,500
- Incredible!
- Win one competition

854
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,460
and get what my mom worked
for half her life?

855
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,660
I should've signed up back then.

856
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,380
With your brain… Seriously?

857
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,740
Can I not take the apartment?

858
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,460
Can I get the cash equivalent?

859
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,380
You don't want the apartment?

860
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,180
He doesn't want the apartment!

861
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,980
Our family already has a place.

862
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,740
My mom says there's

863
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,100
no point in having extra homes.

864
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,700
Chang Wuji's choices

865
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,460
are always so… unexpected.

866
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,860
Let me confirm with

867
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,180
the director backstage, okay?

868
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,040
Sure.

869
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,180
In any case, let's send
our applause and best wishes

870
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,420
to this sixteen-year-old

871
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,860
young man.

872
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,380
But I think his decision makes sense.

873
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,940
What's the use of
an apartment?

874
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,500
Get the cash, buy stocks.

875
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,670
My dad always says that

876
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,180
once the market hits two thousand,

877
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,220
ten thousand is right ahead.

00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,700
My mom's tea egg stand

879
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,620
downstairs at the securities company
has gained

880
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,540
many new customers recently.

881
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:48,420
In short, Chang Wuji is…

882
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:49,620
rich now!

883
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,700
Since he's rich,

884
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:52,900
doesn't that mean we,

885
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,060
his best friends,

886
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,100
deserve a big treat?

887
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,500
- For sure!
- Definitely.

888
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,340
A big treat!

889
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,700
Why didn't Xiao Han come today?

890
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,140
Where's Xiao Han?

891
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,220
He's different from us.

892
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,780
He's a good student,

893
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:17,780
a student leader.

894
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,660
School is about to start,

895
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,420
and he definitely needs to focus on studying.

896
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,060
That... That makes sense.
