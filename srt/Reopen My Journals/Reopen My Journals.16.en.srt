Are you coming with us?

31
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,740
I'm waiting for Ka Men and Chen Mo.

32
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,820
Okay.

33
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,780
Ka Men!

34
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,980

37
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,580
Ka Men.

38
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,420
Let's go first.

39
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,530
Chen Mo said she was unwell.

40
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,300
What's wrong?

41
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,260
She didn't tell me.

42
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,580
I'll get my bike.

43
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,420
Okay.

44
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,380
Momo, you're going to be late. Hurry up.

45
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,620
I'm not ready yet.

46
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,660
You're so slow in the morning.

47
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:54,900
But you never dawdle

Hurry, hurry.

52
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,380
Luckily, you're not late.

53
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,500
Are you okay?

54
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,820
I'm fine.

55
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,620
Is it related to your stomach ache?

56
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,060
Possibly.

57
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,420
I had an upset stomach this morning.

63
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,460
Close the door.

00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,460

of the Sunny Club?

73
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,740
It's really him.

74
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:13,900
Be quiet.

75
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,700
Guys,

76
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,020
we have a new transfer student.

77
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,940
Let's welcome him

78
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,060
to introduce himself.

79
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,340
Hello, my name is Lu Yao.

80
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,740
I'm new here.

81
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,980
Nice to meet you.

82
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,820
Lu Yao's introduction

83
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,460
is very brief.

84
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,620
But I think many of you

85
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,940
already know him.

86
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,780
He's the host of our cable channel.

87
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,700
Lu Yao.

88
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,540
You can sit next to Chang Wuji.

89
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,300
Alright, thank you, Mr. Zhou.

Class begins.

91
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,420
Stand up.

92
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,620
Good morning, guys.

93
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,340
Good morning, Mr. Zhou.

95
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,540
I'm going to the restroom.
Anyone coming?

96
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:12,980
Ka Men?

97
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,500
What's your name?

98
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,580
- Hello?
- Okay, got it.

99
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,380
Restroom?

100
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,500
I'm not going.

101
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,940
He's Lu Yao!

102
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,460
He's so handsome!

103
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,260
What's so special?

104
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,660
Everyone has two eyes and a mouth.

105
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:51,980
Lu Yao.

106
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,620
Lu Yao.

107
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,660
Could you move aside?

108
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,140
Please.

109
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,700
What's wrong?

110
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,820
Hello, Lu Yao.

111
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,740
I'm the class leader.

112
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,900
My name is Pei Dongni.

113
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,420
If you ever need anything,

114
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,300
feel free to tell me.

115
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,580
Okay.

116
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,680
Have you gotten familiar
with the school?

117
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,540
I have some free time after school today.

118
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,740
I can show you around.

119
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,260
Okay, thank you, Class Leader.

120
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,820
I've watched your show before.

121
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,340
I think every episode

122
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,780
is really good.

123
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:26,900
Thank you.

124
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,060
Coming.

125
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,300
Listen,

126
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,300
I've met all kinds of customers.

127
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,460
What kind of customers?

128
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,580
A lady came here

129
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,380
and wanted to try thermal underwear.

130
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,580
Who would try on

131
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,820
thermal underwear?

132
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,580
What if it gets dirty?

133
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,780
Yes, that's right.

134
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,940
It's her, look.

135
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,540
Chen Xiu'e?

136
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,700
Li Qin?

137
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,300
I bought pork.

138
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,300
You bought so much.

139
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,820
No customers today?

140
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,260
I bought too much pork again.

141
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,740
I really didn't expect it.

142
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,780
After the Food Republic opened,

143
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,140
we lost so many customers.

144
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,340
Aiping, you can go back.

145
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,060
Don't just stare at your phone.

146
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,140
You'll hit your head.

147
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,260
Zhang Qiming, you're really rich now.

148
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,300
- What?
- The new version is fun.

149
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,100
It changed a lot.

150
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,820
The former one was heavy,

151
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,380
but this is light and small

152
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,540
and has two batteries.

153
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,390
I don't need to worry about it
during my trips.

154
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,020
It's so exquisite.

155
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,020
You bought two?

156
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,700
Yes, it had a discount for buying two.

157
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,660
I didn't want it.
Why did you buy it for me?

158
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,860
I've bought it.

159
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,860
Come on, it's convenient for me...

160
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,900
for Han to find you, right?

161
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,060
Just take it.

162
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,020
I've quit my night job now.

163
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,020
I'll be either here

164
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,020
or at home.

165
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,540
It's easy to find me.

166
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,220
Just in case, right?

167
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,220
In case...

168
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,380
You're all here.

169
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,740
I was so unlucky today.

170
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,020
Guess who I met.

171
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,300
- Met...
- Who?

172
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,220
Li Qin.

173
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,700
Our colleague at No. 9 Factory.

174
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,540
Guan Aiping was the prettiest girl.

175
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,660
What was her rank?

176
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,260
Not even the 8th.

177
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,140
You still remember

178
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,820
such a small thing?

179
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,300
Li Qin ranked 9th,

180
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,460
and she was the 10th.

181
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,540
Can't get over it.

182
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,700
Who can't get over it?

183
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,500
I ranked 10th

184
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,020
because I joined the factory late.

185
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,140
I didn't know so many people.

186
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,180
I remember Li Qin.

187
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,420
She used to be in the second workshop,

188
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,780
always slacking off at work.

189
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,180
And she altered

190
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,300
her work uniform to fit tightly, right?

191
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,300
She was always swaying around

192
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,180
all day,

193
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,500
throwing flirty glances,

194
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,540
and cracking jokes.

195
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,180
Dagui knows about it.

196
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,300
Exactly.

197
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,260
Back then,
she often went to your canteen

198
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,140
for Liu Dagui.

199
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,100
She played cute

200
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,860
like, "Brother Gui,

201
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,460
Brother Gui."

202
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,740
Liu Dagui.

203
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,580
Did she really pursue you back then?

204
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,740
Let the glory stay in the past.

205
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,540
What?

206
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,220
Do you regret it now?

207
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,100
Well... now that Li Qin is back,

208
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,660
as her Brother Gui,

209
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,100
do you want to flirt with her?

210
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,100
Stop talking nonsense.

211
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,740
She married a good guy.

212
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,940
He's a pilot.

213
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,060
How do you know?

214
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,260
Why do you know so much?

215
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,420
Stop being ridiculous.

216
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,380
You're ridiculous.

217
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,740
So nasty.

218
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,100
Did she marry a pilot?

219
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,540
No wonder.

220
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,660
Guys, stop gossiping about her.

221
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,820
What happened after you met her?

222
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,180
She was shopping.

223
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,180
She saw me at the counter

224
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,020
and recognized me.

225
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,460
She came over especially

226
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,900
and tried on

227
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,940
all the clothes.

228
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,580
I sell thermal underwear,

229
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,660
but she insisted on trying.

230
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,500
I was so pissed off.

231
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,660
I still feel sick now. Oh god.

232
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,500
You skipped work

233
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,340
and came here

234
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,260
just because of that?

235
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,500
Not really.

236
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,380
Then Li Qin left.

237
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,180
I chatted with

238
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,220
the young colleague.

239
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,260
Then we hit

240
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,820
the key topic.

241
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,260
I found out

242
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,160
she and the new girl

243
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,620
get paid 1000 yuan per month.

244
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,940
I've been there for many years,

245
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,750
and I only get 800 yuan a month.

246
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,070
That's ridiculous.

247
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,900
- Why do they get higher salaries?
- Yes.

248
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,060
That's unfair.

249
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,700
You need to talk to your boss.

250
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,060
Talk to my boss?

251
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,180
Cao Debao!

252
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,660
Don't you have a conscience?

253
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,860
I was the one

254
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,580
who made your first counter survive.

255
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,620
Back then, there were no shifts.

256
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,740
I stood here

257
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,820
12 hours every day.

258
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,260
Every time I went to the restroom,

259
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,260
I ran there and ran back!

260
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,100
You told me yourself

261
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,180
that without me,

262
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,700
you couldn't have come this far!

263
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,220
You used to call me Sister Chen.

264
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,260
But what about now?

265
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,500
I can't even

266
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,260
compare to a new employee!

267
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,740
For all these years,

268
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,220
I've treated old and new staff

269
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,300
in different ways.

270
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,860
When you first came,

271
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,340
we agreed on 800 yuan a month.

272
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,660
I didn't bully you.

273
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,140
What are you talking about?

274
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,460
What?

275
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,780
Do you think I don't need

276
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,780
the 800 yuan to make a living?

277
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,500
You troublemaker.

278
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,860
Bosses fear old employees like you.

279
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,700
No criticism or pressure.

280
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,060
Always using seniority.

281
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,300
Little San,

282
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,700
I finally get it.

283
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,260
Bosses like you

284
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,820
are all heartless.

285
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,500
You're all heartless capitalists.

286
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,900
Xiu'e, Xiu'e,

287
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,620
don't be mad.

288
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,060
That's not what I meant.

289
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,700
I was talking about Cao...

290
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,540
De...

291
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,860
- Debao.
- Bao!

292
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,860
Yes, he was wrong.

293
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,260
He's gone too far.

294
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,940
We'll go with you

295
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,100
and get the 200 yuan back.

296
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,060
No need, okay?

297
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,260
Every glance at Cao Debao

298
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,300
makes me sick now.

299
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,120
I've fired him.

300
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,460
I quit.

301
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,340
I'm done.

302
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,010
You quit?

303
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,310
Listen,

304
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,500
at our age now,

305
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,820
it's hard to find

306
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,820
a decent job.

307
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,660
Qian Kang,

308
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,860
my husband,

309
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,500
earns 5000 yuan a month

310
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,060
as a taxi driver, right?

311
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,460
I've endured so much

312
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,660
for the 800 yuan salary.

313
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,700
That was exactly
what I told Cao Debao.

314
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,050
You...

315
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,780
Did you really say that?

316
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,740
Chen Xiu'e,

317
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,420
don't be too impulsive, okay?

318
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,900
Do you think it's easy to find a job?

319
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,500
They only want younger girls.

320
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,620
For example, the 4050 Initiative

321
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,860
only offers you positions

322
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,570
such as a nanny
or a traffic coordinator.

323
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,660
Even the salespersons

324
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,660
must be young and pretty.

325
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,860
Considering this situation,

326
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,740
Cao Debao has kept you

327
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,660
all these years.

328
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,700
He's been kind to you.

329
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,540
Exactly.

330
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,140
Then should I tell him,

331
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:34,500
"Thank you for exploiting me, Mr. Cao.

332
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,100
I'm so happy"?

333
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,340
Seriously?

334
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,460
Look at you.

335
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,860
Xiu'e.

336
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,980
We're in the Southeast Asian
Financial Crisis.

337
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,460
The economy is going down.

338
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,300
Many bosses are struggling
to make a living.

339
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,740
It's really hard to find a job.

340
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,260
People of our generation

341
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,260
can't compare

342
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,460
to the young people now.

343
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,980
They know English and computers.

344
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,860
All the skills we learned before

345
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,420
are useless now.

346
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,260
- Yeah.
- Exactly.

347
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,260
I'm quite lucky

348
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,660
to work

349
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,820
at Pei's place.

350
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,820
Let's put that aside.

351
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,300
The business is so bad.

352
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,100
If I'm broke one day,

353
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,420
I don't know what else we can do.

354
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,620
Just follow my lead.

355
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,460
I'll take you to work at the counter.

356
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,540
As a salesperson,

357
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,500
I sell really well every month.

358
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,100
It's not hard to find

359
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,460
a salesperson job.

360
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:34,420
(High-salary Job)
Cook under 35 years old?

361
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,060
(Hotel Positions)

362
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,460
What's wrong with you?

363
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,500
You're reading a newspaper.

364
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,820
Eat well,

365
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,300
and read Xinmin Evening News.

366
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,820
That's what people say.

367
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:53,860
Bring me

368
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,500
thermal underwear tomorrow.

369
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,100
No work tomorrow.

370
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,820
Then the next day.

371
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,860
No work either.

372
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,020
I... I took

373
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,220
a few days off.

374
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,420
Days off?

375
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,420
For what?

376
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,260
Mom, Xiu'e.

377
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,820
Qian Kang, you're back.

378
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:12,860
I bought some fruit.

379
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,460
My favorite fruit.

380
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,780
Qian Kang.

381
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,900
Look at him.

382
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,520
He leaves early and returns late.

383
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,420
He works hard.

384
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,740
How about your wife?

385
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,820
Sometimes she takes breaks,

386
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,860
and sometimes days off.

387
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,100
She doesn't want to work.

388
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,860
I just feel exhausted.

389
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,100
I want to rest, so what?

390
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,620
Just let her rest.

391
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,700
She can take leaves. It's okay.

392
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,980
Anyway, all the money I earn is hers.

393
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,300
I can't take it anymore.

394
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,820
The oranges are good. Have one.

395
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,860
I don't want it. I'll heat up your meal.

396
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,060
Thanks, Mom.

397
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,660
Honey, I want it.

398
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,940
(Jiale Wontons)

399
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,700
Wait. I'm almost done.

400
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,660
Chen Mo called me early in the morning,

401
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,220
saying her stomach was upset.

402
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,060
She told us to go first.

403
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:01,900
Don't you think

404
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,260
she's been acting strange lately?

405
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,100
She either oversleeps

406
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,340
or has an upset stomach.

407
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,580
Since the school started,

408
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,860
she hasn't joined us.

409
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,520
She probably ate something bad
during the Spring Festival.

410
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,060
Don't worry.

411
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,620
Since the 6th day,

412
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,860
she's been saying her stomach hurts.

413
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,820
Still not recovered?

414
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,100
Should she see a doctor?

415
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,260
Sometimes, time heals all.

416
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,620
No way.

417
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,980
Granny says that neglecting small issues

418
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,260
leads to bigger problems.

419
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,460
Hurry up.

420
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,820
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

421
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,740
Someone

422
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,740
are still in holiday mode

423
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,620
after school starts.

424
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,060
Chen Mo,

425
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,380
stand up.

426
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,180
How long has it been?

427
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,860
You're always late

428
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,900
or just make it before the bell.

429
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,460
Is this your attitude for high school?

430
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,060
Tell me.

431
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,060
Alright.

432
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,180
If you don't want to speak, then don't.

433
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,180
Ask your parents to come.

434
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,660
Ms. Wu.

435
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,020
Chen Mo isn't late for no reason.

436
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,180
She's not feeling well.

437
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,780
It's true.

438
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,220
Since the Chinese New Year,

439
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,400
her stomach hasn't been good.

440
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,130
But she still insists on coming to school.

441
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,860
I can vouch for that.

442
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,260
Chen Mo.

443
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,780
Is that so?

444
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,420
I can also testify.

445
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,740
She's had a stomach ache
since the 6th day.

446
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,500
If she's not feeling well,

447
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,580
her parents should take her
to see a doctor.

448
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,460
Don't delay it.

449
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,740
High school is stressful.

450
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,900
Health is the top priority.

451
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,100
My stomach wasn't good either.

452
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,900
Then Granny started making

453
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,460
longan red date yam soup every day.

454
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,780
Then I felt much better.

455
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,100
I'll bring you some tomorrow.

456
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,380
(Puyang New Village)

457
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,340
Qian Jiayue.

458
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,220
Qian Jiayue, Ka Men.

459
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,350
Chen Mo!

460
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,780
I thought you'd be late today.

461
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,020
I've recovered.

462
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,500
As the Juice Girls,

463
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,820
we must continue our journey.

464
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,140
That's great.

465
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,580
Chen Mo,

466
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,620
Longan Red Date Yam Soup.

467
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,620
Here it is.

468
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,980
Have it later at school.

469
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,900
Thanks.

470
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,940
Let's go.

471
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,860
Catch up with me.

472
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,620
Chen Mo,

473
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,660
are you really okay now?

474
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,980
Yes, let's go.

475
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,580
Qian Jiayue, wait for us!

476
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,930
Hurry up!

477
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,900
Is it high demand

478
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,340
or oversupply?

479
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,620
These two concepts

480
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,380
must not be mixed up.

481
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,620
I'm reminding you

482
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,060
this will be on the test.

483
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,820
Got it?

484
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,420
Got it.

485
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,380
Class dismissed.

486
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,420
Goodbye, Ms. Wu.

487
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,500
Stand up.

488
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:08,980
Make way.

489
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,850
Have you met

490
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,180
many stars?

491
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,980
Are they different

492
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,460
from TV?

493
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,900
It's not that different.

494
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,980
Lu Yao, I heard many celebrities

495
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,100
look better in real life.

496
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,860
Just like you.

497
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,020
I think you look more handsome

498
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:23,980
than on TV.

499
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:24,820
Right?

500
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,110
I can't believe you came to our school.

501
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,820
Jiayue,

502
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,460
why do girls

503
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,660
talk like this now?

504
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,860
The way they talk

505
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,900
- depends on the guy.
- Really?

506
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,420
We watched it together.

507
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,500
Do you mean Mr. Huang?

508
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,540
Yes, yes.

509
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,580
Ka Men, going to the restroom?

510
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,220
I'm not going.

511
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,130
I'll grab some water too.

512
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,220
Let's go, let's go.

513
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,140
Let's go, let's go.

514
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,540
Don't block the way.

515
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,700
Class is starting soon.

516
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,020
Let's go.

517
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,980
What are you doing here?

518
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,300
Don't disturb others.

519
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,580
Clear out.

520
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,980
Get back to your seats.

521
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,660
Lu Yao,

522
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,500
for the speech contest,

523
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,060
I think you're the best choice
in our class.

524
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:13,140
I'm still not very familiar
with the school.

525
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,860
Maybe someone else.

526
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,620
You are a host.

527
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,820
You have a great advantage.

528
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,260
And now you're already

529
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,300
part of our class.

530
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,660
It's your responsibility and duty

531
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,540
to strive for our class's honor.

532
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,100
Actually, I don't know what to say

533
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,420
on the stage.

534
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,500
Don't worry about it.

535
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,720
I'll think of a topic for you.

536
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,100
And after school,

537
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,380
we can discuss it together.

538
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,540
Class Leader.

539
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,500
Lu Yao just transferred here,

540
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,100
and you want him to compete.

541
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,300
Isn't that a bit inappropriate?

542
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,380
What's inappropriate about it?

543
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,590
Wu Chunhua...

544
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:58,380
Ms. Wu told us

545
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:03,540
we should focus on studying.

546
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,620
Activities come second.

547
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,900
If Lu Yao's grades

548
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,620
are affected

549
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,100
by this contest,

550
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,100
who'll be responsible?

551
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,460
It's a rare opportunity.

552
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,540
Thank you for saving me.

553
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:26,940
You're welcome.

554
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,460
I'm Liu Wanqing.

555
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,740
Hello.

556
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,020
I'm Lu Yao.

557
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,190
Lu Yao.

558
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,740
We've met before.

559
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:48,900
Really?

560
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,420
On the New Year's Eve,

561
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,860
you interviewed me.

562
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,980
At People's Square?

563
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,380
You were with your mom,

564
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,820
right?

565
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,700
What a coincidence.

566
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,140
We're classmates now.

567
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,140
Liu...

568
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,340
Liu,

569
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,140
which means willow.

570
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,540
Wan for graceful.

571
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,140
- Qing for clear sky.
- Ka Men.

572
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,620
Ka Men.

573
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,640
Ka Men!

574
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,500
What?

575
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,300
Want some grilled sausage?

576
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,780
No, I don't.

577
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:32,980
Ka Men?

578
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,380
(Jiale Wontons)
No business today?

579
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,220
Don't mention it.

580
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,620
Discounts?

581
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,260
Discounts are good.

582
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,300
I saw a discount notice
at the supermarket,

583
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,640
and the old people were lining up

584
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,020
all the way to the street corner.

585
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:02,940
I waited there

586
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,780
for two hours

587
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:04,940
and bought 12 eggs.

588
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,500
Discounts can bring more customers,

589
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,820
but we'll lose a lot of money.

590
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,420
Maybe we can change the menu

591
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,340
and develop some new dishes?

592
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,100
My cooking skills are limited.

593
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,660
I can't cook Sichuan

594
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,260
or Cantonese cuisine,
steak, or salad.

595
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,020
Unless we hire another chef.

596
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,420
We don't know if business

597
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,260
will be good,

598
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,140
and now we have

599
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,140
a large expense.

600
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,060
Have you noticed?

601
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,460
The saying "Good wine needs no bush"

602
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,620
has a problem.

603
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:40,060
What problem?

604
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,540
First, if there's no bush,

605
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,540
how do you know it's good wine?

606
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,700
Smell it.

607
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,220
You need advertising.

608
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,460
I still remember the ads

609
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,100
I saw when I was young.

610
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,530
"When the sun rises,

611
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,820
I'll love you one more day."

612
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,460
And that.

613
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,380
"Swallow dance,

614
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,580
swallow dance,

615
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,980
dance for our love."

616
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,660
Advertising on TV

617
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,500
will definitely work.

618
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,420
Everyone knows

619
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,860
that it's effective,

620
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,260
right?

621
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,420
We run a small business.

622
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,020
Yes, those are expensive.

623
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,700
Let's think about it.

624
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,060
We'll find a way.

625
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,030
It's this guy again.

626
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,180
Qing often watches his show.

627
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,460
Exactly.

628
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,780
He's handsome.

629
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,420
(Volume)
In most people's eyes,

630
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,600
(Reporter, Lu Yao)
flight attendants must be young.

631
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,900
But this time, Shanghai Airlines

632
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,100
want older flight attendants.

633
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,820
This recruitment

634
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,500
is in response to

635
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,420
the government's
4050 Initiative.

636
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:49,980
We want to help
some laid-off women

637
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,020
(Secretary, Yu Zhengxiang)
to find their stage

638
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,140
and shine once more.

639
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:56,140
Older flight attendants? That's new.

640
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,260
Exactly.

641
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,340
Flight attendants can earn a lot.

642
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,680
Thousands of yuan per month.

643
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,540
Some can even bring

644
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,020
some stuff back and sell them.

645
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,700
Especially for international flights,

646
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,540
such as from the U.S.,

647
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,780
or Europe,

648
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,940
they can earn more than

649
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,060
10 thousand yuan a month.

650
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,500
10 thousand yuan?

651
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,780
I work 12 hours a day,

652
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,820
but I can only earn

653
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,140
800 yuan a month.

654
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,140
She only earns 500 yuan.

655
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,700
Zhang Qiming, you...

656
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,700
Stop talking nonsense.

657
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,100
Pei let me work here,

658
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,220
and that's good enough.

659
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,300
500 yuan is enough.

660
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,900
Zhang Qiming, listen.

661
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,580
We can even afford

662
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,980
the 500 yuan salary.

663
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,060
10 thousand yuan a month?

664
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,540
Our company

665
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,140
hired a college graduate recently.

666
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,100
A graduate.

667
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,580
But he only earns 3000 a month.

668
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,100
Can they earn more
than college graduates?

669
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,100
Why don't we give it a try?

670
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,740
Try what?

671
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,180
Be a flight attendant?

672
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,540
Seriously? People like us?

673
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,540
I'm just kidding.

674
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,540
(Make a Sentence)
Look at this.

675
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,580
You misplaced "also" here.

676
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,140
For adverbs like "also" and "always",

677
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,620
just remember it should be
after "be" and before real verbs.

678
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,100
After "be" and before real verbs?

679
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,180
What does that mean?

680
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,940
"I will always love you."

681
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,420
You've heard this song, right?

682
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,780
"Love" is a real verb.

683
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,900
"Always" should be placed before it.

684
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,340
Another one.

685
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,340
"You're always a naughty boy."

686
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,300
"Are" is a be verb,

687
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,980
and "always" should be placed after it.

688
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,780
Understand?

689
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,460
Yes, you're a good teacher.

690
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,340
You're not focused.

691
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,740
How can you get into our school?

692
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,100
I'm not unfocused.

693
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,260
You just need to teach me more often.

694
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,460
Stop joking.

695
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,580
We've finished reviewing the paper. Bye.

696
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,900
Where are you going?

697
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,180
Going home, of course.

698
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,180
Well, the English paper is done,

699
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,380
but...

700
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,260
but I still have a Chinese paper.

701
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,500
We haven't reviewed that.

702
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,340
Chinese...

703
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,660
Like...

704
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:04,940
Well, look.

705
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,900
Listen.

706
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,620
What happened to you?

707
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,580
Why do you want to get into our school?

708
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,860
What happened?

709
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,060
I just want to be as excellent as you

710
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,100
and Brother Xiao Han.

711
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,900
Not me.

712
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,860
Brother Xiao Han is our role model.

713
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,060
Well, okay.

714
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,740
What about this question?

715
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,060
It's the same mistake as before.

716
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,860
(Blessing)

717
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,980
Why are you still here?

718
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,100
Manager.

719
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,860
I'm waiting for you.

720
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,660
Manager Wu, listen,

721
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,740
the years I spent at Anrui

722
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,260
were really worthwhile.

723
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,540
I can sell shoes,

724
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,060
bags, underwear,

725
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,500
and clothes.

726
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,100
Listen, I'm a good salesperson.

727
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,140
Just give me a chance.

728
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,700
You'll be satisfied.

729
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,500
Why are you so stubborn?

730
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,940
I've told you

731
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,780
(Age: Under 30)
you're not qualified.

732
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,460
The age requirement for salespersons

733
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,580
was not my idea.

734
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,650
Check other department stores.

735
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,300
They're the same.

(Restroom)
I was rude.

738
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,900
Cao, we've known each other for years.

739
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,700
You know my temper, right?

740
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,180
Just take the tea

741
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,660
and forget about it.

742
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,500
It's not working.

743
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,100
I really can't take it.

744
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:19,820
Sister Chen.

745
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,140
Aren't you sick of me?

746
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,620
It's a normal reaction, right?

747
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,540
You can't control it.

748
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:28,780
Besides,

00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:29,940
your husband makes

750
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,300
over 5000 yuan a month.

751
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,940
Why endure this

752
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,300
for 800 yuan?

753
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,700
I have things to do.

754
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,380
Let's talk later, okay? Goodbye.

755
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:52,820
Come out.

00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,480
Of all the shopping mall restrooms,

762
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,780
you had to come to this one.

763
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,980
And you happened to come at this time.

764
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,140
It shows we're in sync.

765
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,740
I was too impulsive

766
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,780
the other day.

767
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,500
Honey,

768
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,620
I didn't believe them before.

769
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,980
It's so hard to find a job.

770
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,980
You know, shopping malls

771
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,700
only want salespersons

772
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:32,820
under 35 years old.

773
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,420
Some even require them to be under 30.

774
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,580
What about us?

775
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,540
Should we all...

776
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,900
all just stay at home

777
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,860
and never get a job?

778
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,380
Don't be upset.

779
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,540
Didn't you say it?

780
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,140
I can earn a lot.

781
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,620
I can support you.

782
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,300
I was just being pretentious

783
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,700
in front of others.

784
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,780
I know how tired

785
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,300
you've been as a driver.

786
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,660
You have a sore back

787
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,780
and a lot of issues.

788
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,220
You don't

789
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,900
even dare to drink water at work,

790
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,940
fearing losing business
when finding a restroom.

791
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,140
I just think it's better for me to work

792
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,380
and support the family.

793
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,580
Look at you.

794
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,860
Why can't I drink water?

795
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,100
I drink it all the time.

796
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,900
I'm not tired.

797
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,340
Every time I think of you and Jiayue,

798
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,500
I feel so

799
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,340
energetic.

800
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,780
You're always like this,

801
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,300
making me happy.

802
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,700
If you're upset,

803
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,140
I'll feel more tired.

804
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:31,780
Let's go.

805
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,780
Let's go shopping.

806
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,380
Things in this mall

807
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,420
are quite expensive.

808
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:37,940
Right here.

809
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,180
You don't work for

810
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,340
Cao Debao anymore.

811
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,340
You're a customer.

812
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,460
Let's go shopping.

813
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,700
Let's teach him a lesson.

814
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,100
Yes, honey.

815
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,220
Exactly.

816
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,340
I'm a customer.

817
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,020
- I'm their queen.
- Yes.

818
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,660
Then I'm going to be

819
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,540
Cao Debao's queen.

820
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,380
Yes, that's right.

821
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,540
Look, when the queen is upset

822
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,740
something breaks.

823
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,500
- Honey.
- I'll carry it.

824
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,580
I don't want to shop now.

825
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,420
Let's go back and fix this, okay?

826
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,300
This tea was a gift. It's expensive.

827
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,140
I'll take it.

828
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,700
It's broken. I need to use it next time.

829
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,700
Let's go back and fix it.

830
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,420
(Puyang New Village)

831
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,900
(Jiale Wontons)

832
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,220
Auntie Huang, I'm going to school.

833
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,700
- Ka Men.
- Be safe.

834
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:19,860
Where is Qian Jiayue?

835
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,780
She left for a school journal meeting.

836
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:22,900
Let's go.

837
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:23,860
Alright, let's go.

838
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,420
Hello,

839
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:37,940
where's your badge?

840
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,300
My badge...

841
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,500
Where's my badge?

842
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,260
I clearly wore it this morning.

843
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,340
Today is Monday.

844
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,060
Don't you know
you should wear the badge?

845
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,460
Class 5, Grade 10, three points.

846
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,300
You...

847
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,900
Did you drop this?

848
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,340
See, I have a badge.

849
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:02,940
Put it on.

850
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,660
(Shanghai Puyang No. 2 Middle School)

851
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,180
Hello.

852
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,380
Where's your badge?

853
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,260
Did you drop this?

854
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,300
It was a good job.

855
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,900
Why did you quit?

856
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,540
You can't stay at home

857
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,980
and do nothing.

858
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,460
I'm not a couch potato, okay?

859
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,900
After I get up,

860
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,740
I buy groceries, cook, boil water,

861
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:09,540
sweep, mop, and do laundry, right?

862
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,420
Have I ever slacked off?

863
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,020
No matter how much you do,

864
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,580
you're relying on
Qian Kang's money, right?

865
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,780
Aren't you also relying on

866
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,100
Qian Kang's money?

867
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,340
Qian Kang has no problem with it.

868
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,420
How can you blame me?

869
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,020
Move.

870
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:45,980
(Sakura Garden)

871
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,780
We're here.

872
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,380
- Not bad, huh?
- Yes.

873
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,460
Look over there.

874
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,860
- Thanks.
- I can do it myself.

875
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,690
- Let me take it.
- Don't worry. It's my duty.

876
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,510
Are you okay?

877
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:10,900
Are you alright?

878
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,620
Did you twist your back?

879
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,060
He's bleeding! Call for help!

880
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,220
I'll call for an ambulance.

881
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,820
Hey, what's wrong?

882
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,660
It's okay.

883
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:22,700
It's okay.

884
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,780
Your head is fine.

885
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,100
Just a small bump.

886
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,060
No concussion.

887
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,180
That's great.

888
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,380
But your back is not good.

889
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,220
Your herniated disc

890
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,220
is very severe.

891
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,340
Maybe you should consider

892
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,300
a surgery.

893
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,100
Can we avoid the surgery?

894
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,620
No surgery?

895
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:43,420
You need to rest at home
for at least a month.

896
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,860
During this time,

897
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,580
can I still drive?

898
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,700
You still want to drive?

899
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,100
You want to sit in a wheelchair

900
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,110
for the rest of your life?

901
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,240
- Okay, I'll rest.
- Honey!

902
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,140
Honey!

903
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,100
Xiu'e.

904
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:56,940
Honey!

905
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,100
What happened to your head?

906
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,460
It's okay.

907
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,780
Tell me what number this is.

908
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:06,020
Doctor, my husband
can't even recognize this!

909
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,140
Can you save him?

910
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,060
It's okay.

911
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,100
Don't speak, okay?

912
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:14,620
(Puyang New Village)

913
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:24,660
Baby,

914
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:25,940
don't worry.

915
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,620
The doctor said his head

916
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,500
would be fine in a few days.

917
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,350
As for the back...

918
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,500
Well, he's old.

919
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,700
It's normal to have such problems.

920
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,500
He just needs to rest for a while.

921
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,340
Don't worry.

922
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,460
I'll be fine in a few days.

923
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:41,900
Eat.

924
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:44,740
Jiayue.

925
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,900
I forgot the soup. Go get it.

926
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,140
I'll help you.

927
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:57,220
Qian Kang's got a herniated disc.

928
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,380
Maybe he needs a surgery.

929
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:01,900
Rest for a few days?

930
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,060
I can't believe you said that.

931
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,300
Mom, stop it.

932
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,260
Xiu'e didn't want Jiayue to worry.

933
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,460
Exactly.

934
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,140
I care about my husband, of course.

935
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,460
How can you blame me?

936
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,330
Ridiculous.

937
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,380
Who else should I blame?

938
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,380
Didn't you know

939
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,460
his back was unwell?

940
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,580
Mom...

941
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,380
How could you quit your job?

942
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,380
Have you thought about us?

943
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,740
If you hadn't felt wronged

944
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,620
and quit your job, Qian Kang...

945
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,300
- Here's the soup.
- They got the soup.

946
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,140
Come on.

947
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,220
Have some soup.

948
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,740
Be careful. It's hot.

949
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,420
Eat.

950
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:51,700
(Puyang New Village)

951
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,500
Mom, Uncle asked Mao Tou
to bring the therapy lamp.

952
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,980
Remember to use it for Dad.

953
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,060
Mao Tou, thank your dad.

954
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:57,980
And the safflower oil.

955
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,380
We're going to school.

956
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,460
Okay, okay.

957
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,180
Is this useful?

958
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,700
Yes, it's useful.

959
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,100
Thank you.

960
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,220
Come on.

961
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,780
Be careful.

962
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,180
Alright.

963
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,600
This is the ginger pack
we made for Qian Kang.

964
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:18,980
Give it to him.

965
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,820
Make sure to warm it up first.

966
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,180
It helps with circulation.

967
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,020
Yes.

968
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,140
So comfortable.

969
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,860
Honey, I'm back.

970
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:39,940
You're back.

971
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,260
Oh my goodness.

972
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:44,940
Don't move.

973
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:45,980
What are you doing?

974
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,140
Turn it off?

975
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,060
- Have you finished?
- Yes.

976
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,100
Let me do it.

977
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,900
Your back just got better.

978
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,700
Don't waste the effort.

979
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,620
Don't worry. I'm much better.

980
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:57,940
Much better?

981
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,340
With a back strain like that,

982
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:02,100
one needs to rest for months.

983
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,580
It's only been a few days.

984
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,300
A few days?

985
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,940
It's been several weeks.

986
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:09,100
You go out to look for a job

987
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,260
and take care of me every day.

988
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,580
It's too tiring.

989
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,460
Don't talk about that.

990
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,740
I'm supposed to care for you

991
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:16,980
when you're ill, right?

992
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:18,780
By the way,

993
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,540
what about the job

994
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,740
at the grocery store?

995
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:23,740
Look.

996
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,300
Not only didn't I get the job,

997
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,540
but I also spent a lot of money.

998
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,660
I was so pretentious.

999
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:30,980
If I had known this,

1000
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,700
I wouldn't have argued with Cao Debao.

1001
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,260
Don't worry. It's okay.

1002
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,300
Sorry for this.

1003
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,860
I'll be able to
start working again soon.

1004
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:44,430
By the way,

1005
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,460
it's your birthday next week.

1006
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,680
Let's go out

1007
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,860
and have a good meal.

1008
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,740
- Enough.
- What's the point of celebrating it?

1009
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,140
After the birthday,

1010
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,700
I'll be another year older.

1011
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,700
In that case,

1012
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,860
it'll be harder to find a job.

1013
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,500
No celebration?

1014
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,300
No celebration.

1015
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,500
Alright, no celebration.

1016
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,500
No celebration?

1017
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,780
Don't laugh. You'll...

1018
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,620
Xiu'e.

1019
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,260
Here's 1000 yuan. Take it.

1020
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:24,980
Why are you

1021
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:26,620
giving me money?

1022
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,540
Go ask around

1023
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,060
and find a good restaurant.

1024
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,640
The one we went to
after Baby's High School Entrance Exam

1025
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:33,740
was terrible.

1026
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,780
It was so expensive
and not tasty at all.

1027
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,090
Find a new one

1028
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:39,060
and book a private room.

1029
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,420
I think Qian Kang

1030
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,700
is almost recovered.

1031
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:42,980
By the end of this month,

1032
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,860
we'll have a nice family dinner.

1033
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,980
What's wrong with her?

1034
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:00,180
I thought she had forgotten my birthday.

1035
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,260
She even gave me money

1036
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,660
to have a nice meal.

1037
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,180
It's your 44th birthday,

1038
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,980
45 years old as in nominal age.

1039
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,380
How could she forget it?

1040
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:13,940
Mom.

1041
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:17,260
Let's go to the Oriental Pearl

1042
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,260
Revolving Restaurant, okay?

1043
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,700
It has

1044
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,220
a big sphere inside.

1045
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,540
It actually rotates.

1046
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,540
The Eastern Airlines Captain

1047
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,380
often takes his wife there.

1048
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,660
Oriental Pearl?

1049
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:29,900
I've heard

1050
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,460
it's pretty good.

1051
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,060
But you have to confirm

1052
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,340
if this restaurant

1053
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,700
serves Western cuisine.

1054
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,780
It can't be all Chinese cuisine, okay?

1055
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,100
Western cuisine?

1056
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:42,460
Ask them if they have
steaks or hamburgers.

1057
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:43,700
Adults can have

1058
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:44,900
Chinese cuisine.

1059
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,500
I'm worried the children won't like it.

1060
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:50,940
Mom, Western cuisine is inappropriate.

1061
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,460
Look, for a birthday party,

1062
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,700
we need a spinning round table.

1063
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,500
Chinese food is more suitable.

1064
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,060
What birthday?

1065
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,060
Whose birthday?

1066
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:00,900
My birthday is in September.

1067
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,220
You're so forgetful.

1068
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:11,100
