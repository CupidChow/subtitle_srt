=Episode 6=

24
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,990
Where exactly do you want to go?

25
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,430
What's going on?

26
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,800
It's nothing.

27
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,430
Had a fight with your parents?

28
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,200
Sometimes, I really envy you.

29
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,760
It'd be better if I didn't have a dad.

30
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,030
Sorry! I shouldn't have said that.

31
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,000
Don't be angry.

32
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,840
Now I kind of understand

33
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,960
why your dad hit you.

34
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,500
Now I realize how selfish

35
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,180
and cold he is!

36
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,620
He's like a tyrant,

37
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,820
wanting to control everything.

38
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,220
We're different.

39
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,900
Your dad is gone,

40
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,100
so he's perfect

41
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,820
in your eyes forever.

42
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,540
You really are

43
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,780
bad at talking.

44
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,320
No matter what my dad is like,

45
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,220
I still wish he were alive.

46
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,380
I often think,

47
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,100
if he were still around,

48
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,620
I could be carefree like you,

49
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,140
shouting at him when I'm upset,

50
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,500
being scolded

51
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,020
when I fail exams,

52
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,890
someone looking for me
when I skip school to play games,

53
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:15,740
running away from home

54
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,140
when I'm frustrated.

55
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,820
As long as he's here.

56
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,540
When it comes to envy,

57
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,700
you have no idea how much I envy you.

58
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,500
Envy me?

59
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,100
Did you ever play a game
when you were little?

60
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,020
Your dad would

61
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,660
put his hand

62
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,420
just a bit above your head

63
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,260
and tell you that

64
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,940
if you jumped, you'd reach it.

65
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,020
Then you'd keep jumping,

66
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,820
and when you almost got there,

67
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,980
he'd raise his hand again,

68
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,500
and you'd never reach it.

69
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,780
When I was a kid,

70
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,660
my dad loved playing this game with me.

71
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,060
Every time, it would end only when

72
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,180
I cried my eyes out.

73
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,580
Later, I thought

74
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,540
my relationship with him

75
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,580
was just like that game.

76
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,260
I would never

77
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,220
be able to reach his hand.

78
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,490
But think of it from another angle.

79
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,620
Maybe he was trying to motivate you.

80
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,060
Let me tell you a story.

81
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,380
When I was six,

82
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,260
I remember it very clearly.

83
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,660
My dad took me
to the natural history museum

84
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,140
and kept

85
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,580
telling me what each dinosaur was

86
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,660
and what era everything was from.

87
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:35,940
Fine,

88
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,380
he's a genius,

89
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,660
he knows everything.

90
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,260
A lot of people

91
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,860
followed us,

92
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,380
thinking he was a tour guide.

93
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,930
I was happy to listen.

94
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,700
Then, suddenly, he stopped,

95
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,820
looked at me seriously,

96
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,660
and asked,

97
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,850
"Tell me,

98
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,810
what did I just say?"

99
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,580
How could I remember?

100
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,900
He exploded,

101
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,580
yelling at me in front of everyone,
calling me a fool

102
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,620
and an idiot!

103
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,340
He pointed at me and said,

104
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,540
"How can a stupid kid

105
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,620
like you be my child?"

106
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,340
Then he walked away.

107
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,860
All I could think was,

108
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,580
"That's it.

109
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,980
My dad doesn't want me anymore.

110
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,900
I'll end up begging on the street

111
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,740
like he said."

112
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,860
That's just adults messing with kids.

113
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,860
No!

114
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,760
He's been like that since I was little.

115
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,860
If I didn't do something right,

116
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,700
he'd say,

117
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:27,860
"If you can't even do this,

118
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,440
you'll be begging on the street one day."

119
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,020
I really thought

120
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,180
I'd end up begging.

121
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,380
Later that day, my mom picked me up.

122
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,540
How bad

123
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,940
is my life, huh?

124
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,380
I didn't realize

125
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,260
your dad was so harsh.

126
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,580
He's more than harsh.

127
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:52,900
It's late.

128
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:53,980
Let's go home.

129
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,960
If you don't go back now,

130
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,380
when your dad sees you, he will…

131
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,100
He will what?

132
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,140
Let's go.

133
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,980
(Jinxiu Garden)

134
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,220
We're here.

135
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:12,940
Hurry back.

136
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,350
Xiao Han,

137
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,100
your dad must love you so much,

138
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,260
way more than my dad

139
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,460
ever loved me.

140
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,100
(Shanghai Puyang No. 2 Middle School)

141
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,860
He really slapped you?

142
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,260
Where did you go

143
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,380
after that?

144
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,820
Nowhere. Just wandered around.

145
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,660
Alone?

146
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,780
I…

147
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,740
Chen Mo,

148
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,580
don't do this next time.

149
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,060
Your mom almost cried,

150
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,260
and mine almost cried too.

151
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,260
It's all because my dad hit me!

152
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,020
There's a limit to what one can endure!

153
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,340
If he hits me again, I'll…

154
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,460
call the police.

155
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,140
- Your dad hitting you…
- Time to collect homework.

156
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,500
Please pass it in.

157
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,060
Come on.

158
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,100
Qian Jiayue,

159
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,220
I have a question.

160
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,820
Why would you like someone

161
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,900
so different from you?

162
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,740
What?

163
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,820
Don't pretend. Ka Men told me everything.

164
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,740
She's such a blabbermouth.

165
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,180
It wasn't just her.

166
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,340
I figured it out myself.

167
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,140
But can two people who are so different

168
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,390
really have anything to talk about?

169
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,220
I can learn about the things
he likes to talk about.

170
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,180
I'd rather he learn about the things
I like to talk about!

171
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,240
- Let me tell you…
- Class is starting.

172
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,700
No more chatting.

173
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,480
Hurry up! Class is starting.

174
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,440
- Almost late!
- Hurry!

175
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,740
Alright.

176
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,180
Before we begin,

177
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,300
I need to announce something.

178
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,820
Wu Zheng

179
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,840
got sick over the weekend,

180
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,740
diagnosed with viral myocarditis.

181
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,460
He's taking a month off.

182
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,900
He's our class's Life Committee Member,

183
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,140
so we need someone

184
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,460
to fill in temporarily.

185
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,460
According to the last vote,

186
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,700
it should go to

187
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,020
Qian Jiayue.

188
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:43,980
Qian Jiayue,

189
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,140
are you willing?

190
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,420
I am.

191
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,780
I am willing.

192
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,500
Good. Sit down.

193
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:53,900
Class.

194
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:54,980
Attention!

195
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,740
Good morning, everyone.

196
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,060
Good morning, teacher.

where did you get the karaoke machine?

205
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,460
I brought it.

206
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,020
Morning.

207
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,420
Why are you here so early?

208
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,690
Don't you have school today?

209
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,740
Baby,

210
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,300
I asked him to come early.

211
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,420
The competition's coming up,

212
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,860
we need to practice.

213
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,740
Honey, honey.

214
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,180
Listen to this voice.

215
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,650
Isn't my dad out driving today?

216
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,580
He's not.

217
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,520
He specifically took the day off to sing.

218
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,140
This couple

219
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,260
is unbelievable.

220
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,620
- Unbelievable!
- Look at me.

221
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,420
Why do you always look at the TV?

222
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,260
Qian Jiayue,

223
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,340
why don't you sing?

224
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,540
Why me?

225
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,380
- You sing.
- Go sing.

226
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,220
I'll record it.

227
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,340
My dad assigned me this task.

228
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:07,740
Recording.

229
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,860
Rain falling in the heart.

230
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,260
You're making me so nervous.

231
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,420
Chen,

232
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,140
Director Zhao from the neighborhood
committee came yesterday.

233
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,940
She said this is a National Day event,

234
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,940
and since we just moved here,

235
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,380
and both you

236
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,300
and I are party members,

237
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,590
she hopes we'll lead by example
and participate.

238
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,260
She's already putting pressure on us.

239
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,660
You can go if you want,
but I'm not going.

240
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,060
Momo, how about

241
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,100
we go together?

242
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,300
Me?

243
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:50,490
What should I do?

244
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,940
I really don't want to perform.

245
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,380
Then...

246
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,180
let your mom perform alone.

247
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,100
No way.

248
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,540
To be chosen as Model Family,

249
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,820
at least two

250
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,540
family members need to participate.

251
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,580
It's so annoying!

252
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,640
Do you have to perform too?

253
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,540
What are you performing?

254
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,740
With your dad or your mom?

255
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,020
With my dad

256
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,660
and my mom.

257
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,020
Cha-cha!

258
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,820
Rumba!

259
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,140
Jitterbug!

260
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,740
Feel the unique Latin vibes!

261
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,580
Mine is Chinese traditional culture.

262
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,660
Whether it's the park, the square,

263
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,020
or on stage,

264
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,380
I shine brightest!

265
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:35,380
Tasteless!

266
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,420
Lowlife!

267
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,740
Qing, who will you choose?

268
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,780
So I just had to say,

269
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,220
"You're right.

270
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,740
You're right too."

271
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,820
So I'm going to dance with

272
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,060
both of them.

273
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,590
Now I feel like my situation
isn't that bad after all.

274
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,100
Brother Xiao Han.

275
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,380
Jiayue.

276
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,300
Ka Men.

277
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,220
I'll go with them.

278
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,420
Alright.

279
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,740
- I'll go up first.
- Okay.

280
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,740
I heard from my mom that

281
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,380
Xiao Han's family and Mao Tou's family
are teaming up.

282
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,020
Will Xiao Han get on stage and sing?

283
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,420
I've never heard

284
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,580
him sing.

285
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,860
Is he tone-deaf or something?

286
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,700
I don't think so.

287
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,540
He is.

288
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,460
I've heard him.

289
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,240
During flag-raising,
when we sang the national anthem,

290
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,460
his voice sounded like
a lark going through voice change.

291
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,740
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

292
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,260
By the way, how about you come over

293
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,060
for watching the National Day parade
on the 1st?

294
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,340
My parents won't be home.

295
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,660
Great!

296
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,140
- Let's do it together!
- Sure.

Chen Mo, can I join too?

298
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,900
Of course! Call Xiao Han as well.

299
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,620
- The more the merrier.
- I'll call him.

300

Qian Jiayue, invite Chang Wuji too.

301
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,700
No problem.

302
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,980
Don't waste the chance, alright?

303
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,540
Don't let me down for helping you out.

304
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,700
Okay.

305
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,630

The scholarship is for students
from low-income families.

It's not small, 2,000 yuan per year.

The goal is to encourage students
to overcome hardships.

his family situation is tough.

so formally for a rehearsal?

Brother Xiao Han is going too?

379
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,460
Mom, hurry up!

380
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,340
Why are you so eager all of a sudden?

381
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,180
Uncle.

382
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:50,940
Mrs. Xiao.

383
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,820
- Jiayue.
- Jiayue.

384
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,900
Be serious with your moves.

385
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,220
My moves are fine.

386
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,220
Jiayue, you're here.

387
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:00,980
Mr. Liu.

388
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,940
Jiayue's here!

389
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,260
Mrs. Liu.

390
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,020
Ka Men?

391
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,180
Why's your makeup like this?

392
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,340
Qian Jiayue,

393
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,460
my reputation is ruined…

394
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,460
What a giant New Year picture doll.

395
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,340
So the face is finally revealed.

396
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:26,900
Don't record me!

397
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:27,820
Hey!

398
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:28,980
What's wrong, baby?

399
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:29,820
What's next?

400
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,540
Hi, Aiping.

401
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,980
Aiping, is that a wig?

402
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,540
When did you get it?

403
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,260
It looks so good.

404
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,140
His look is horrible.

405
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,030
What kind of style is that?

406
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,540
What kind of dance are you doing?

407
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,700
Latin.

408
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,420
Latin? Not authentic at all.

409
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,460
What are you doing?

410
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,340
Whatever, I'm just dancing.

411
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,780
Let's spin around.

412
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,260
I'll spin and go out.

413
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,340
We'll spin over there, okay?

414
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,140
My situation isn't
that much better than yours.

415
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,940
- Hurry up.
- Mom, I really don't want to…

416
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,260
Come in now.

417
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,180
Aiping.

418
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,540
- Hi.
- Fangfang, you're here.

419
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,660
Have you called her Auntie?

420
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,580
Qian Jiayue. Qian Jiayue!

421
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,500
Chen Mo!

422
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,620
You look gorgeous!

423
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,140
No. Not at all.

424
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,660
Let's go.

425
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:47,420
♪I really miss you♪

426
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:54,020
♪I'm waiting for the dawn in the night♪

427
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,940
- ♪The stars in the sky♪
- Record them.

428
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:02,260
- ♪Also know my heart♪
- Stop recording now.

429
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:07,540
♪Silently sending me true feelings♪

430
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:14,900
♪I really miss you♪

431
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:20,860
♪I'm waiting for the dawn in the night♪

432
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,780
I didn't know

433
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,740
you were so talented.

434
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,180
Thanks.

435
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:40,980
Chen Mo!

436
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,460
- You played really well.
- Really?

437
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,220
I didn't know you could play the guzheng.

438
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,540
Your dress looks really good.

439
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,900
I recorded you a lot!

440
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,540
You should wear dresses more often.

441
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,580
I don't like wearing dresses.

442
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,220
It's my dad who insists on me
being some kind of lady.

443
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,060
It's not bad to be one once in a while.

444
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,340
The guys' taste…

445
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,660
Did Wang Bin tell you?

446
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,540
Tomorrow we're going to Chen Mo's home
to watch the parade.

447
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,020
Brother Xiao Han, are you free?

448
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,780
He told me.

449
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,170
- I'm free.
- Yay!

450
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,700
I've already told my parents.

451
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,220
We can have a lot of fun.

452
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,220
Really?

453
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,130
- Fun?
- That's great!

454
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,780
Where are we going? Take me with you!

455
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,980
My home. You wanna go?

456
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,340
Of course!

457
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,540
Mrs. Liu is doing makeup
for Godmother.

458
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,380
Do you wanna go see?

459
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:28,900
Come and take a look!

460
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,300
Did your parents stop

461
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,380
scolding you after you got home?

462
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,580
They did.

463
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:43,610
That's good.

464
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,740
Look at this.

465
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,540
(Display artistic style
Sing the songs of the times)

466
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,620
Is this makeup too heavy?

467
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,180
Too heavy?

468
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,060
Not heavy at all.

469
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,220
Not heavy?

470
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,700
Is it heavy?

471
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,940
- It's heavy.
- Not heavy.

472
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,900
Did you hear what Mao Tou said?

473
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,460
- Not heavy.
- Looks good.

474
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,980
I think the eyeshadow

475
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,940
could use a little more.

476
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,060
Add, add, add.

477
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,340
Add a bit more.

478
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,460
Should I bring an umbrella?

479
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,580
"Heart Rain".

480
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,060
It's going to rain,

481
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,300
so I'll bring an umbrella.

482
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,580
I bought a new one

483
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,540
with little butterflies.

484
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,340
I'll place it on my shoulder.

485
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,100
It'll definitely look chic.

486
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,260
How about

487
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,940
we change the song?

488
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,500
"The Butterfly Lovers" would be nice!

489
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,940
I don't want to change.

490
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,690
Then let's sing a Shanghai opera.

491
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,460
Open a window for you.

492
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,220
It's very popular, everyone likes it.

493
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,180
Zhang Qiming, are you singing or not?

494
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,780
Sing, I will sing.

495
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,780
Test, test.

496
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,260
Ladies and gentlemen of No. 9 Factory,

497
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,740
come on out.

498
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,660
The performance is starting.

499
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,980
Zhang Qiming?

500
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,660
What performance?

501
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:12,980
Qian Jiayue.

502
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,540
Honey, over here.

503
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,500
Next, Ms. Guan Aiping and I

504
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,580
will perform a segment
from "The White-Haired Girl".

505
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,540
She'll play Xi'er,

506
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,860
and I'll play her father.

507
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,620
Be cheerful when you're performing.

508
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,060
What's cheerful about playing Yang Bailao?

509
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,700
You look like him!

510
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,020
You really look like him! So real!

511
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,660
Stop teasing me.

512
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,500
Go, Aiping.

513
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,390
Aiping dances so well.

514
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,740
Momo,

515
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,540
I'm going to your Uncle Wang's home.

516
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,500
Don't oversleep.

517
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,290
Didn't you say
your friends were coming over?

518
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,140
I've left snacks and drinks

519
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,660
on the tea table for you.

520
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,660
You really are so chatty.

521
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,240
Does she need reminding about having fun?

522
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,180
Let's go. Hurry.

523
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,020
You...

524
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,500
And

525
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,580
don't forget the fruit in the fridge!

526
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,460
And lunch.

527
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,020
Wait for me!

528
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,220
Yes!

529
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,420
Jiayue,

530
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,620
I bought you fried dough sticks
and soy milk.

531
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,900
Are you ready?

532
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,060
In a sec!

533
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,460
Coming! Coming!

534
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,840
- Chen Mo!
- Ka Men!

535
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,770
Has anyone else arrived?

536
00:24:58,770 --> 00:24:59,580
You're the first one.

537
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,540
Really?

538
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,380
These slippers.

539
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,420
Okay.

540
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,300
Coming.

541
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,780
Qian Jiayue! Come on in.

542
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,620
Chen Mo!

543
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,640
Why are you so late?

544
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,030
We've already started playing cards.

545
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,300
I got held up for a bit.

546
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,140
Change your shoes.

547
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,260
Okay.

548
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,580
Come on.

549
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,700
Qian Jiayue's here!

550
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,660
- Come on, come on.
- Sorry, I'm late!

551
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,660
Qian Jiayue, you're finally here!

552
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,100
Quick, take Wang Bin's place.

553
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,460
His card skills are so bad.

554
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,340
He always forgets the cards.

555
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,100
So you're blaming me?

556
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,780
Fine, I'll take the blame, okay?

557
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,380
Look at my face.

558
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,340
We're on the same team,

559
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,940
and you don't have any marks on.

560
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,420
Jiayue, do you know how to play?

561
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,260
I do.

562
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,860
Alright, join Ka Men's team

563
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,500
and let's see if you two can win.

564
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,420
Come on, Jiayue.

565
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,900
How far have you guys played?

566
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,100
Our team's at 3.

567
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,180
Our team's at J.

568
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,020
I just played a pair of five of clubs.

569
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,190
Ka Men played a king of clubs.

570
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,500
Now it's Chen Mo's turn.

571
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,740
Attack!

572
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,660
Hearts are trump.

573
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,500
Qian Jiayue, if you can beat, beat.

574
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,620
If not, don't add any points!

575
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,460
Got it.

576
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,460
Beat.

577
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,860
Beat again!

578
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,460
We just avoided seventy points!

579
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,700
Qian Jiayue, are you doing this
on purpose?

580
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,860
I told you to beat if you can,

581
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,100
but don't add points if you can't.

582
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,320
You purposely played a pair of kings!

583
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,460
I thought a pair of trump kings
was big enough.

584
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,940
Jiayue just came. Don't blame her.

585
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,820
No internal strife.

586
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,540
Right, you didn't know there was
also a pair of ace of hearts.

587
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,660
Oh my, we're done for.

588
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,060
Look at you, Ka Men.

589
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,380
You always

590
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,180
say we're done for.

591
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,980
Why don't you look at yourself?

592
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,340
Okay, Ka Men, stop complaining.

593
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,700
What else can I do?

594
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,940
Tell me, what else can I do?

595
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,520
Why don't we have Chang Wuji replace you?

596
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,600
You join Qian Jiayue's team.

597
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,260
Yeah, Chang Wuji, you play.

598
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,740
What game are we playing?

599
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,060
80 points. Can you play?

600
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,940
- I know a little.
- Come on.

601
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,030
Chang Wuji, think carefully.

602
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,980
Chen Mo and I are already at J.

603
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,900
Are you sure you can handle this?

604
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,700
What are the rules again?

605
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,940
No worries, I'll explain.

606
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,380
Yeah, it's simple.

607
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,020
All clubs.

608
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,700
Xiao Han, you still have some clubs.

609
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,420
All the points you left are ours.

610
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,340
Chen Mo,

611
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,030
your trump is not enough,
you can't beat me.

612
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,340
Show your cards.

613
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:30,700
Jiayue has 20 points.

614
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,300
Shuffle.

615
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,540
We're at 4.

616
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,740
Pretty good.

617
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,100
Fast learner.

618
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,660
It's okay, we're still at J.

619
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,540
Xiao Han, your third round ace
is already played.

620
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,420
The only ace left is with Jiayue.

621
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,100
Chen Mo, you have one
ten of diamonds left.

622
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,340
Play it, I'll play the king.

623
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,660
Jiayue, we're at 7.

624
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,500
It's okay, we're still at J.

625
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,740
Come on.

626
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,180
Show the cards.

627
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,260
You've got forty points.

628
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,100
We're at K.

629
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,860
Awesome, Chang Wuji!

630
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,140
Are you a genius or what?

631
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,900
How do you remember all the cards?

632
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,060
Do you have any tricks?

633
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:11,980
Teach me!

634
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:14,380
- Finished yet?
- Finished!

635
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,590
Look at this big turtle.

636
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,180
Brother Xiao Han!

637
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,240
It must be the first time you've had
a turtle drawn on your face!

638
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,940
I've never seen Xiao Han
like this before.

639
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,900
Xiao Han, this big turtle!

640
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,660
You're the turtle!
You've got two turtles!

641
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,500
Look at mine.

642
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,390
If you didn't know,
you'd think they were moles!

643
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:33,540
Are you saying

644
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,700
I didn't draw them well?

645
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,740
Seriously, look at his.

646
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,620
No, I'll add two more strokes for you.

647
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:40,260
Let me add two more strokes.

648
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,100
Add?

649
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,780
You can't add anymore! No more!

650
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:58,980
♪Youth is like a pair of footsteps♪

651
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:06,200
♪Innocently measuring the dream♪

652
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:10,480
♪Over mountains, past obstacles♪

653
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,800
♪See if the world♪

654
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:19,510
♪Feels like a theme park♪

655
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:24,010
♪The future has countless different looks♪

656
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,140
Let's take a group photo!

657
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,500
Come on!

658
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,100
Look at me!

659
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,380
Three, two, one!

660
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,500
Smile, cheese!

661
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:37,420
♪Sometimes short, sometimes long♪

662
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,660
This is so spectacular.

663
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,700
They're really so coordinated.

664
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,640
Watching this makes me
want to join the army.

665
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,700
Look, female soldiers!

666
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,380
So this is Chang'an Avenue.

667
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:51,900
Beijing's sky is so blue,

668
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,740
and the road is wide.

669
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,260
I really want to go to Beijing!

670
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,580
I want to go too!

671
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,820
Let's go together in the future.

672
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,860
Qian Jiayue,

673
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,860
what are you writing?

674
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,760
I'm writing down the narration.

675
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,360
What for?

676
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,140
I'm going to use it
in my composition later.

677
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,440
Did the teacher tell us
to write compositions?

678
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,800
No.

679
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,860
I'm writing it myself.

680
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,340
Their steps are incredibly synchronized.

681
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,580
Hurry up, you two!

682
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:26,940
Let's warm up
before Liu Jianfeng arrives.

683
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,600
- Bye, Chen Mo!
- Take care!

684
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,740
Brother Xiao Han,

685
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,780
after your game, I'll look for you.

686
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,060
I've got something for you.

687
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,140
Sure.

688
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,140
We're heading out now.

689
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,340
Thanks for having us.

690
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,700
No problem! Come again soon!

691
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,300
- Bye.
- See you later!

692
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:47,180
Everything was perfect today
except the card game.

693
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,180
Chang Wuji,

694
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,740
you were amazing earlier,

695
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,940
like a legendary martial arts master
from a novel.

696
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:54,060
Thanks.

697
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:56,570
Chang Wuji,

698
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,190
why don't you walk Qian Jiayue home?

699
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,020
No need.

700
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,180
Workers' New Village is just

701
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,340
across the street.

702
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,190
Crossing the street can be dangerous.

703
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,180
Actually, traffic accidents in Shanghai

704
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,390
have decreased in recent years.

705
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,780
Most accidents

706
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,940
involve vehicles,

707
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,660
not pedestrians.

708
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,740
As long as you walk properly…

709
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,540
Excuse me. It's really unnecessary.

710
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:20,900
Really.

711
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,100
I agree.

712
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,060
I agree too.

713
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:25,630
Bye.

714
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,100
Bye. See you at school.

715
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,080
See you.

716
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:28,940
We're leaving too.

717
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,240
- Leaving.
- Walk safely.

718
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,090
- Happy Holiday!
- Bye.

719
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,500
- Happy Holiday!
- See you at Xidian Mall!

720
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,220
(Puyang New Village)

721
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,300
Brother Xiao Han,

722
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,100
come here.

723
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:50,940
What?

724
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,820
Brother Bin lent me
the tape of "Fight Back to School".

725
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,180
He said it's really good

726
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,860
and that there's a surprise.

727
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,940
But have you finished your homework?

728
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,100
Don't spoil the fun!

729
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,500
It's the first day of the holiday,

730
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,810
there's plenty of time ahead.

731
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,380
- Without it, it will…
- It's very dangerous.

732
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,820
What?

733
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:34,820
What's going on?

734
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,660
It's probably a very old tape.

735
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,100
Is it erased?

736
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,020
I don't know.

737
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,300
What... What is this?

738
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:50,020
Mao Tou, stop watching it.

739
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,420
Quick, turn it off!

740
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,180
Soon... Soon...

741
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,300
Soon... Soon, it'll come back.

742
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,580
I see you're not

743
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,060
very happy with playing Yang Bailao.

744
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:03,940
Yongqiang's dad.

745
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,460
I originally wanted to use this chance

746
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,540
to show everyone our emotions,

747
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,500
but it turned into showcasing

748
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,280
the relationship
between Yang Bailao and his daughter.

749
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,740
The idea completely went sideways.

750
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,100
I didn't think that much.

751
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,060
Do you know why I chose this piece?

752
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,140
Why?

753
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,860
When I hear this music,

754
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,540
I think of the lively days
at No. 9 Factory.

755
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,300
The first time you sang "Red Yarn"

756
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,700
was at our factory's

757
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,940
National Day party.

758
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,980
I was in the audience, almost drooling.

759
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,140
I get it now. I promise

760
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,460
I'll perform Yang Bailao well.

761
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,580
I prepared a piece of red yarn.

762
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:43,220
To tie my daughter's plait.

763
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,940
To tie your plait.

764
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,860
You need to practice more.

765
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,060
Others do it like butterflies,

766
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,060
but yours look like...

767
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,300
grasshoppers!

768
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,180
Grasshoppers? Well…

769
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,340
Is Han at home?

770
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,740
- He's not here.
- Come on!

771
00:33:58,740 --> 00:33:59,580
Take it!

772
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,420
Why me?

773
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,260
- No way!
- Han?

774
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,260
Han?

775
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,700
Han?

776
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,060
Han?

777
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,220
Han?

778
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,700
I told you,

779
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,580
he's not here.

780
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,580
Didn't they agree to

781
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,540
go to a classmate's home
to watch the parade?

782
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,540
I clearly heard a voice just now.

783
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,820
You're exhausted, you're hearing things.

784
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,220
Let me get you some water.

785
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,220
Aiping,

786
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,340
the kids are really supportive
of us participating

787
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,780
in the Model Family event.

788
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,180
About...

789
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,660
us...

790
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:47,020
can you give me clear instructions?

791
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,740
Mao Tou has the High School Entrance Exam.

792
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:50,700
Han is

793
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,060
stressed with high school.

794
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,420
Is that clear enough?

795
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,780
Clear.

796
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,340
Clear enough for three years ahead.

797
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:02,580
High school and college entrance exams
are important,

798
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,700
but I was thinking...

799
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,180
in fact,

800
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,220
we should tell the kids

801
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,980
sooner.

802
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:13,980
That way,

803
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,420
I can take better care of you both.

804
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,140
Right? You see,

805
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,380
you don't take my money,

806
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,180
but work so hard every day.

807
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,020
No matter,

808
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,940
I really feel for you.

809
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,500
But I really don't know

810
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,180
how to bring it up with Han.

811
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,060
And...

812
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,140
actually, I haven't

813
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,180
thought through a lot of things.

814
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,220
Don't push me.

815
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:48,980
No, no,

816
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,140
I definitely didn't mean that.

817
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,180
Definitely not.

818
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,620
Sometimes, dealing with kids

819
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,900
really feels like a war.

820
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,340
An outflanking war.

821
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,740
A protracted war.

822
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,100
I need to study "The Art of War" again.

823
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,220
No problem.

824
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,140
As for the Model Family competition,

825
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,580
I'll do my best and try to

826
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,700
leave a good impression on Han.

827
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,300
Not just Han.

828
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,580
Don't forget about Mao Tou.

829
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,940
What will Mao Tou think?

830
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,740
He definitely won't have any objections!

831
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,700
I guarantee it.

832
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,580
He must have no objections.

833
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:20,820
Rest assured.

834
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,020
I'm telling you,

835
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,380
don't always be so rough on Mao Tou.

836
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,500
Okay, okay.

837
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,380
Everything you say, I'll take it to heart

838
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:29,100
and slowly change.

839
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,460
Qiming, smoke on the balcony.

840
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,020
Han doesn't like the smell of smoke
in the room.

841
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,740
I can hold it for three years,

842
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,940
but I can't hold back one cigarette?

843
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,540
Are you kidding?

844
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,380
I won't smoke.

845
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,220
It's fine.

846
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,660
Since

847
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,140
the little ones aren't here,

848
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:51,990
we don't have to cook for them.

849
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,260
Right?

850
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,940
Let's go to Nanjing Road,

851
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,500
I'll buy you some new outfits

852
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:59,140
for the competition.

853
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,180
Let's go.

854
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,020
The competition doesn't need new outfits.

855
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,940
We're playing the roles of
Xi'er and her dad.

856
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,500
We're definitely getting first place.

857
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,380
Let's buy the clothes

858
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,590
for when we celebrate the victory.

859
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,690
Come on, let's go buy them.

860
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:11,580
No, I don't want new clothes from you.

861
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,890
Then I'll buy some for Han.

862
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,020
He likes to play basketball,

863
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,580
I'll buy him a nice pair
of basketball shoes.

864
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:16,900
It's settled. Let's go.

865
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,100
You're rare to have a day off,
and if you stay

866
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,740
at home, you'll start working again.

867
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,140
Let's go to Nanjing Road,
eat a nice meal,

868
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,180
and then hit the mall.

869
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,980
The stores have discounts
for National Day.

870
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,980
Go. Leave it to me.

871
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,140
Brother Xiao Han.

872
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,620
Brother Xiao Han?

873
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,620
Did you hear that?

874
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,380
It felt like

875
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,820
I was dreaming.

876
00:37:59,020 --> 00:37:59,860
Brother Xiao Han?

877
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,820
Mao Tou?

878
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,600
Is Brother Xiao Han here?

879
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,440
Yes.

880
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,140
Brother Xiao Han,

881
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,300
Jiayue is here to see you.

882
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:12,900
He's inside.

883
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,100
Brother Xiao Han.

884
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:22,900
Here.

885
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:24,740
What's this?

886
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:27,060
This is the Self-Reliance Scholarship
Application Form.

887
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,780
(Self-Reliance Scholarship Application Form)

888
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,540
This Self-Reliance Scholarship

889
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:33,860
has 2,000 yuan.

890
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:34,900
Based on your situation

891
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,740
and your grades,

892
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:37,290
you can definitely get it if you apply.

893
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,620
Think it over.

894
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,660
The school year just began.

895
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,640
I worry that they might not know
your family's situation,

896
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,620
so I made a copy for you.

897
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,460
Situation?

898
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,440
What's the situation with my family?

899
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:54,660
"No poor student should be left behind"?

900
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:55,860
I don't need it.

901
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,420
But it's 2,000 yuan.

902
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,500
I said I don't need it!

903
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,180
Right, he doesn't need it.

904
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,190
His mom and he will have someone
take care of them.

905
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,180
He doesn't need it.

906
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,180
Someone will take care of them?

907
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,660
- Who?
- Whoever it is,

908
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,500
we don't need it!

909
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,840
And I don't need anyone's charity!

910
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:14,500
That's the situation with my family!

911
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,340
Got it?

912
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,980
I... I'm sorry.

913
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,780
Go home.

914
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,220
I'm sorry.

915
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:11,060
(I love my country
Wishing it prosperity and strength)

916
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,420
(Shanghai Puyang No. 2 Middle School)

917
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,300
"In the Dimming Light".

918
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:26,300
Please fill in

919
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,700
your student number and class.

920

Qian Jiayue?

921
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,780
Chang Wuji.

922
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,820
Didn't you go home?

923
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,900
Why are you here?

924
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,060
What about you?

925
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,980
Why didn't you go home?

926
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:57,770
My dad is at home playing mahjong.

927
00:40:57,930 --> 00:40:58,860
I don't want to go back.

928
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,980
What's wrong?

929
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,620
Did you cry again?

930
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:12,820
Chang Wuji,

931
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,890
do you think

932
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,260
I'm useless?

933
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,460
You're not bad at playing cards.

934
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,100
Good memory.

935
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,490
About the same level as Xiao Han.

936
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,580
Anyway, you're better than
Chen Mo and Wang Bin.

937
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,660
I'm not talking about playing cards.

938
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:33,280
I just feel like sometimes

939
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,110
I don't understand a lot of things.

940
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,900
If you don't understand something,

941
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,420
don't bother figuring it out.

942
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,580
Just be yourself.

943
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,300
Like now, if I want to read a book,

944
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,260
I read a book.

945
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:48,220
If you want to do something, do it.

946
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,180
What do you want to do now?

947
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,700
You keep reading.

948
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,260
I'll just sit for a bit.

949
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,540
Okay.

950
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,540
(Sailor)

951
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,060
Are you there?

952
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,860
(Send Message)
I'm feeling a bit down.

953
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,860
Want to talk?

954
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:31,380
(Sailor)

955
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,220
What's the matter?

956
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,460
Why is it that when you try to

957
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,060
be kind to someone,

958
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,860
he ends up yelling at you?

959
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,170
It's not good to be angry.

960
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:45,740
I'll teach you a way.

961
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:46,980
Imagine me as him,

962
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,180
and say to the screen,

963
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:49,700
"I'm being kind,

964
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,060
why are you yelling at me?

965
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,780
You hurt me,

966
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:53,790
and you should apologize."

967
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,420
(Thank you.)

968
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:05,850
Brother Xiao Han.

969
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:09,900
Are you angry?

970
00:43:14,227 --> 00:43:17,159
