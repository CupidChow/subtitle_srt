=Episode 17=

24
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,340
Mom.

25
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,900
Western food…
isn't really appropriate, is it?

26
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,380
I mean, it's a birthday,

27
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,620
we need a spinning round table, right?

28
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,300
Chinese food feels more fitting.

29
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,980
What birthday?

30
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,980
Whose birthday?

31
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,780
My birthday is in September!

32
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,140
Are you losing your mind?

33
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,220
Jianjun called and said

34
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,980
that he and Jianguo

35
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,300
are bringing my grandkids

36
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,100
from the U.S. to Shanghai.

37
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,300
They even named it

38
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,020
the "Roots-seeking Tour."

39
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:08,900
Pretty fancy, right?

40
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,420
They're coming all the way from overseas,

41
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,100
so I need to show some face.

42
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,460
We should treat them

43
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,020
to a proper meal.

44
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,740
The Oriental Pearl will be perfect.

45
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,220
I love it.

46
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,820
So, the money you're giving me

47
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,060
is because your beloved sons
are coming back,

48
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,220
and you want me to use it
to book a restaurant, right?

49
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,060
Exactly.

50
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,380
I don't want to do it.

51
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,780
Why?

52
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,120
It's just booking a restaurant.

53
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,420
What's there to be unhappy about?

54
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,660
Mom, Qian Kang's back
is in terrible shape,

55
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,820
and I'm out
searching for a job every day.

56
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,580
At the employment agency,

57
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,220
I'm treated like a rotten cabbage,

58
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,820
picked over and thrown aside.

59
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,140
I've gotten so many dirty looks!

60
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,860
Don't you care about any of this?

61
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,980
All you care about is...

62
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,100
"My precious sons are coming back!"

63
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,820
Right?

64
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,420
At the end of this month,

65
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,020
her nominal age is going to be 45.

66
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,420
When you mentioned a meal,

67
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,380
she thought you were
celebrating her birthday.

68
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,700
What month is it now?

69
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:16,980
March!

70
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,500
Oh no.

71
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,020
Oh no,

72
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,060
this is really bad.

73
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,220
Qian Kang.

74
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,740
This is terrible.

75
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,820
I really forgot.

76
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,660
I completely forgot.

77
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,500
I'm so sorry.

78
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,620
Maddening, huh?

79
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,420
Can you see how maddening this is?

80
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,380
In that family,

81
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,900
in her heart,

82
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,300
only her two sons

83
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,710
are her real children.

84
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,700
Only their matters

85
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,980
are important.

86
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,220
The whole world should

87
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,220
revolve around them.

88
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,780
Maybe Chairwoman Liao

89
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,220
didn't mean it like that?

90
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,420
If she didn't,

91
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,780
then what else could she mean?

92
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,660
Even if she did,

93
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,780
her favoritism isn't something
that just started.

94
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,860
Her two sons…

95
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,460
Well, Xiu'e…

96
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,020
Pei didn't mean it like that.

97
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,380
She… She just wants to comfort you.

98
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,260
Look, if you lower your expectations,

99
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,780
you'll feel better.

100
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:21,900
Your heart will feel lighter.

101
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,660
Just think about

102
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,060
how my husband treats me,

103
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,620
and how your husband treats you.

104
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,980
If I compared the two,

105
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,820
I'd have been driven crazy long ago.

106
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,060
But your husband is capable.

107
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,220
Qian Kang is a good husband.

108
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,420
But now,

109
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,780
with his back problems,

110
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,940
I'm not sure

111
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,980
what he'll do

112
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,380
if he has to stop driving a taxi.

113
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,380
Don't be so pessimistic.

114
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,260
Qian Kang is still young,

115
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,660
and he'll be fine.

116
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,300
True, at least he's younger

117
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,460
than Zhang Qiming.

118
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,060
But Zhang Qiming

119
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,780
doesn't have back problems...

120
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,740
What...

121
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,580
What are you doing?

122
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,060
Pei,

123
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,540
your husband's back

124
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,780
seems really good!

125
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:15,900
I work in the pharmacy.

126
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,280
I can get any medication you need.

127
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,260
Need anything?

128
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,660
No.

129
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,740
Listen,

130
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,700
I...

131
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,620
Goji wine is enough.

132
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,260
I don't need anything.

133
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,430
- What about you?
- Fangfang,

134
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,860
I actually need something.

135
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,140
What do you need?

136
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,980
Are you out of your mind?

137
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,140
I'm not talking about that!

138
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,300
Then what is it?

139
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,810
I'm being serious!

140
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,160
Fangfang, your husband

141
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,370
is well-connected.

142
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,020
He has great networks, right?

143
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,780
Can he help me book a reservation

144
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,740
at the Oriental Pearl
Revolving Restaurant?

145
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,140
I thought…

146
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,220
Wasn't you

147
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,460
just complaining about

148
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,860
how annoying another person is?

149
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,900
Yet you still ask Fangfang

150
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,940
to help you book a table.

151
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,940
Xiu'e is all talk but soft-hearted.

152
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,440
No matter what Chairwoman Liao asks,

153
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,460
Xiu'e takes it to heart.

154
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,300
Exactly.

155
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,500
Just lower your expectations

156
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,740
and relax a little.

157
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,220
Alright.

158
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,820
I'll handle it.

159
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,740
I'll ask my husband.

160
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,660
Chen,

161
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,260
isn't it just a phone call?

162
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,140
I remember

163
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,580
last time when you went with

164
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,820
Director Wang and others,

165
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,860
you got it all sorted out
with just one call.

166
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,220
What do you know?

167
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,340
It's not as simple as
just making a phone call.

168
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,380
There are a lot of people

169
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,140
and politics involved. It's complicated.

170
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,540
Fine, fine,

171
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,900
I don't know much about it.

172
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,180
But if it weren't for Chen Xiu'e,

173
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,820
I wouldn't even be asking.

174
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,340
This isn't just about her birthday.

175
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,100
Her brothers are coming back
from the U.S.

176
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,620
Her mom…

177
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,660
You're really talkative.

178
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,900
After spending so much time

179
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,140
with these little people,

180
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,660
you've really started to…

181
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,140
Chen!

182
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,340
I won't do this again, okay?

183
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,260
Don't do this again.

184
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,820
Just this once.

185
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,460
Let me remind you,

186
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,140
don't keep taking on
these favors for others.

187
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,980
I know, I know.

188
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,510
Look at you.

189
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,140
Honey.

190
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,380
I'm back.

191
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:36,900
Xiu'e.

192
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,740
You're back.

193
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,660
Honey!

194
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,780
What are you doing?

195
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,860
The doctor said not to move too quickly.

196
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,420
- I'm fine.
- Sit down, quickly!

197
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,660
Listen to the doctor.

198
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,260
This is from Mom.

199
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,860
Why are you holding it?

200
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,180
This is the extra 600 yuan.

201
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,060
Two meals,

202
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,580
both her treat.

203
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,940
One for your birthday

204
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,340
and one for your brothers' return.

205
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,060
She's not biased.

206
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,660
What?

207
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,990
She finally had a change of heart.

208
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,940
I've always been fair, okay?

209
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,460
Mom, did you hear that?

210
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,300
I did.

211
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,940
Where's the bias?

212
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:23,940
Who am I biased against?

213
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,660
Honey,

214
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,100
I've pulled some strings
to book the restaurant.

215
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,100
You need connections
to book a restaurant?

216
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,580
That's nonsense.

217
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,660
What connections are you talking about?

218
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,580
Honey,

219
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,500
I, Chen Xiu'e,

220
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,260
really have connections everywhere.

221
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,580
Honey,

222
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,100
give her back

223
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,460
the extra money.

224
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,220
We're family,

225
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,700
there's no need to have two meals.

226
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,380
Don't waste the money.

227
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,260
Give it back.

228
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,460
Mom,

229
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,660
Xiu'e said

230
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,420
we only need one meal,

231
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,460
no need to waste money.

232
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,380
I know.

233
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,260
I've already collected the quilts.

234
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,340
Tell her

235
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,980
to help me put the quilt covers on.

236
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,140
Xiu'e,

237
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,340
Mom wants you

238
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,020
to help her with the quilt covers.

239
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,580
I need to get changed first.

240
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,260
(Class 5, Grade 10)

241
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,410
Dust.

242
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,380
But… who's even going to touch that?

243
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,580
We'll correct it right now.

244
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,900
There's dust,
minus two points.

245
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,180
Please! If you deduct two points,

246
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,990
- we'll lose our mobile red banner!
- Exactly!

247
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,100
Please, give us a break!

248
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,260
Look, look!

249
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,660
Everywhere else is clean.

250
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,740
It's just that spot

251
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,340
because I can't reach it.

252
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,580
You saw it,

253
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,340
the door, the wood,

254
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,980
and everywhere else is spotless.

255
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,820
Please…

256
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,740
The dust was noticed.

257
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,260
- Help us out.
- I promise

258
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,260
there won't be dust next time.

259
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,540
We'll wipe it clean!

260
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,460
Excuse me.

261
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,580
The thing is,

262
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,290
the door frame

263
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:32,380
is too high for us to reach.

264
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,580
Well,

265
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,220
let me clean it now.

266
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,820
See? No more dust.

267
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,460
We'll clean it next time.

268
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,740
We'll correct it.

269
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,620
We'll be more careful.

270
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,820
- Miss?
- Miss?

271
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,060
Well…

272
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,660
make sure to be more careful next time.

273
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,460
- We will.
- Of course we will.

274
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,580
Goodbye!

275
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,500
- Bye!
- Thank you!

276
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,380
Thanks! I'll buy you a drink!

277
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:01,980
Chen Mo!

278
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,260
How are you even on duty?

279
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,380
Be careful next time!

280
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,220
I… I…

281
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,020
Lu Yao,

282
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,460
thanks to you,

283
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,300
we were able to keep
the mobile red banner.

284
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:11,860
Thanks to you.

285
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,700
No problem.

286
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,340
What are you buying me?

287
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,620
How about cola?

288
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,060
Everyone,

289
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,940
I have something to announce

290
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,900
during break time.

291
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,060
In two weeks,

292
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,660
we'll be hosting a group of
foreign exchange students

293
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,540
at our school.

294
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,660
Our school

295
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,220
is going to hold a party,

296
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,060
and we need two hosts.

297
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,700
One male, one female.

298
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,140
The only requirement is

299
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,340
good English.

300
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,140
You're all welcome to sign up.

301
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,140
Ka Men's English is great!

302
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,060
- Ka Men!
- Ka Men,

303
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,020
go sign up!

304
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,900
Right, weren't you a hostess

305
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,380
in the Little Star when little?

306
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,820
I think you can give it a try.

307
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:52,740
Exactly.

308
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,260
She and Lu Yao are a perfect pair as hosts.

309
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,100
Exactly.

310
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,460
I'm tonight's host, Lu Yao.

311
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:07,990
Uncles and aunts.

312
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,860
(Happy Reunion, Happy New Year)
Boys and girls.

313
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,940
Happy New Year!

314
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,340
I'm tonight's hostess, Liu Wanqing.

315
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,580
I'm tonight's host, Lu Yao.

316
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,900
Lu Yao, 1990 is coming soon.

317
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,620
What are your wishes for the new year?

318
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,820
I hope that my friendships
with my classmates

319
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,780
and friends

320
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,260
will last forever.

321
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,740
Now, let's enjoy the first performance:

322
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,060
- Children's Choir "Little Conch".
- "Little Conch".

323
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,080
1990…

324
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,820
(1990, Qing, 6, at the Children's Palace)
So we shared the stage when I was six.

325
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,780
Qing, come eat.

326
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,140
Qing,

327
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,540
try this

328
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,820
and that.

329
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,660
Try a little.

330
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,420
What's going on?

331
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,660
Is your taste messed up?

332
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,500
The food has no flavor.

333
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,340
Business is so bad right now.

334
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,820
I'm trying to save on oil and salt.

335
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,380
What's wrong with you?

336
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,140
How much can you even save on that?

337
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,460
I was just joking!

338
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,720
Lately, I've been
getting winded more easily

339
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,780
when I dance.

340
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,780
I've gained 1.5 kg.

341
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,740
I need to control my weight.

342
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,220
Just eat more healthily with me, okay?

343
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,900
Dance, dance, dance!

344
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,980
Business is bad, and you still

345
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,140
have the energy to dance?

346
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,780
Control you weight

347
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,740
at such an old age?

348
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,340
Look how bad this meal is!

349
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,660
Business isn't good,

350
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,780
and you're worried about

351
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,380
whether the food tastes good?

352
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,060
That is exactly why

353
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,540
I need good meals.

354
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,820
It's the only joy I have left.

355
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,740
But you sacrificed that for your dancing!

356
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,820
What's wrong with it?

357
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,820
Lighter meals are actually better.

358
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,860
What's good about it?

359
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,020
Look at Qing.

360
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,500
She hasn't eaten a bite.

361
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,660
Qing, are you sick?

362
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:31,980
No.

363
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,300
Aren't you her dad?

364
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,460
You know nothing about your daughter.

365
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,460
Since when does sickness

366
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,620
affect her appetite?

367
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,900
Even if she's sick, she'll still eat a lot.

368
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,340
It's all because
the meal is terrible.

369
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,100
The tomato is...

370
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:46,940
I'm not eating.

371
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,140
See? It's all because

372
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,180
it tastes bad.

373
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,460
No!

374
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,740
I… I'm not eating tonight.

375
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,260
I'm on a diet.

376
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,340
You guys eat.

377
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,500
(I won't sign up unless I lose 5 kg!)

378
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,260
(Puyang New Village)

379
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,820
Liu Songming, hurry up!

380
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,180
All closed?

381
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,460
- Yes.
- Go.

382
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,220
Aiping?

383
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,780
- Aiping.
- You're still here?

384
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,780
I'll stay here for a bit,

385
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,060
in case any customers show up.

386
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,300
What customers?

387
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,580
- No one would come.
- Right.

388
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,540
Let's go.

389
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:48,980
Hurry up.

390
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,300
Go get some rest.

391
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,300
Liu Songming,

392
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,820
your mom made me speechless.

393
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,620
She only told us
after the relatives arrived.

394
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,460
Can you stop nagging?

395
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,820
How was I supposed to know?

396
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,740
She should've

397
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,380
informed us earlier, right?

398
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,020
It's too late now.

399
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,660
Aiping, we're leaving.

400
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,420
Go get some rest, okay?

401
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,580
- Just go.
- Hurry up!

402
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,660
See you tomorrow!

403
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:15,360
Mom,

404
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,900
due to the student council meeting,

405
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,980
I won't be home for dinner.

406
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:18,900
Don't cook too much.

407
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,700
Hello?

408
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,540
- Qiming.
- Aiping,

409
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,220
Liao just called.

410
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,660
He's meeting with Director Wang.

411
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,260
He needs me to go with him.

412
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,100
So you won't be home for dinner?

413
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,460
No.

414
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,780
- You know, business.
- Okay.

415
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,820
Don't drink too much.

416
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,660
Got it.

417
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,380
Should I wear this?

418
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,900
Mom, this red one

419
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,900
looks great!

420
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,420
Will it be too cold?

421
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,580
You don't know, do you?

422
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,700
At the Oriental Pearl
Revolving Restaurant...

423
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,100
inside the sphere...

424
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,420
I heard it's so warm,

425
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,260
you can wear

426
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,940
a short-sleeve shirt and still feel hot!

427
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,460
Then I'll change.

428
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,380
Hurry up! This one's perfect.

429
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,300
The international call, Mom! Hurry!

430
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:26,460
Who's calling?

431
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,980
Jianguo or Jianjun?

432
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:28,820
Hurry.

433
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,660
Who is it?

434
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,400
Sit down. I'm answering the phone.

435
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,260
Who could it be?

436
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,860
- Hello?
- Hello?

437
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,740
Jianjun!

438
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,700
Mom. Yeah, it's me.

439
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,580
Is my sister there?

440
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,340
Jianjun, listen.

441
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,180
Sis, I...

442
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,020
I booked the Oriental Pearl

443
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,220
Revolving Restaurant for you.

444
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,060
It was so hard

445
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,020
to get a reservation!

446
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,860
- I know.
- To welcome you.

447
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,710
Isn't it great?

448
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,700
Well, sis, listen...

449
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,260
Wait, let me finish.

450
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,460
I've planned the restaurant,

451
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,540
- the travel, everything...
- No, sis, this time...

452
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,780
- Sis...
- What are you saying?

453
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,660
I'm saying, this time, Jianguo and I

454
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,260
might not be able to come back.

455
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:05,940
Why?

456
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,100
Everyone's waiting for you!

457
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,140
Why aren't you coming?

458
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,020
Mom, don't be upset.

459
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,300
It's Lili.

460
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,220
She got into

461
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,660
a really good MTI training camp,

462
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,220
which is crucial
for her college applications.

463
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,380
So,

464
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,140
Yafen and I decided

465
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,020
to accompany her there.

466
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,860
College is important.

467
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,540
Yeah, college is important.

468
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,340
At least Jianguo
can come back, right?

469
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,020
Jianguo?

470
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,420
Didn't he call you?

471
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,460
No!

472
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,020
It's Shen.

473
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,220
Her mom got sick last week

474
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,540
and needs treatment in the U.S.

475
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,500
I think they'll be staying
for quite a while,

476
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,660
so,

477
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,900
Jianguo won't be able
to come back either.

478
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,820
Then health is more important.

479
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,980
Treatment is important.

480
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,540
Yeah, treatment...

481
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,340
Jianjun,

482
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,060
since you're not coming back,

483
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,100
there's nothing else

484
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,700
to discuss.

485
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,660
Let's hang up.

486
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,380
Long-distance calls are expensive.

487
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,820
Mom, sorry.

488
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,420
Next year,

489
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,180
we'll try our best to come back.

490
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,020
Enough. No more "next year."

491
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,420
This year, you say "next year."

492
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,640
Next year, you'll say the same.

493
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,380
It's the same

494
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,770
every year.

495
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:18,740
We know

496
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,740
you're all busy people,

497
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,740
and we're just idle.

498
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,940
We're just too idle,

499
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,020
revolving around you.

500
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,220
Long-distance calls are expensive.
I'm hanging up!

501
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,220
What are you doing?

502
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,660
Hanging up the call like that?

503
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,460
Your brother didn't mean it.

504
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,780
Mom, the Revolving Restaurant...

505
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,300
we're still going, right?

506
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,340
Cancel it.

507
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,220
Mom, it's my birthday.

508
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,540
That restaurant is hard to book.

509
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,380
Cancel it!

510
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,300
Keep the money.

511
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,100
Don't return it to me.

512
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,620
No one

513
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,820
is coming back anyway!

514
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,620
Why should I bother picking out clothes?

515
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,860
What a headache.

516
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,020
Aiping, stop.

517
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,700
There are no customers.

518
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:28,980
Xiu'e.

519
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,500
Hey.

520
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,700
Fangfang is not here?

521
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,540
She just left.

522
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,100
Why?

523
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,420
Do you need something from her?

524
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,180
I need her to help me

525
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,020
cancel the reservation
at that restaurant.

526
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,620
Why?

527
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,860
Chen Jianjun and Chen Jianguo

528
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,220
aren't coming back.

529
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,860
My baby's school journal

530
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,620
has a term: "At forty,

531
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,860
one is no longer confused."

532
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,980
But I think it's wrong.

533
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,900
I'm over forty,

534
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,940
but I'm really confused.

535
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,220
With a parent, a young child,

536
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,820
and Qian Kang's

537
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,940
health problems,

538
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,500
and I can't even find a job

539
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,540
because they say I'm too old.

540
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:17,980
I mean,

541
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,340
am I really this unlucky?

542
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,500
Pah, pah, pah!

543
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,260
Who curses themselves like that?

544
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,300
Look at you.

545
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,820
You can't find a job,

546
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,420
but the worst part is
you're just not making money, right?

547
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,740
But look at me!

548
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,860
I've got a restaurant this big,

549
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,620
and the business is still bad!

550
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,370
I have to keep putting
my own money into it.

551
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,060
So who's the unlucky one here?

552
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,620
Among the three of us,

553
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,620
Aiping is the luckiest.

554
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,620
At least you've got Zhang Qiming.

555
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,060
No matter what,

556
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,260
you've got some security.

557
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,380
That's true.

558
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,300
What security do I have?

559
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,940
Think about it.

560
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,500
These past few years

561
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,060
have witnessed such a huge change.

562
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,580
In the past,

563
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,420
I was busy all day long.

564
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,460
Every morning,

565
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,300
I'd rush to the wonton shop.

566
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,420
After work, I'd go to Mr. Zhu's.

567
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,260
By the time I got home,

568
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,540
I still had to

569
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,540
clean and cook.

570
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,980
My days were

571
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,540
packed from morning till night.

572
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,060
Working yourself to the bone.

573
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,100
Exactly!

574
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,740
And when I finally got to bed,

575
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,020
I'd sleep like a log.

576
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,220
But now,

577
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,020
I'm just idling around.

578
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,860
No tasks pressing me.

579
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,860
I feel empty inside.

580
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,540
I keep wondering,

581
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,820
what should I do next?

582
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,940
Is it going to be like this forever?

583
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,620
How will I spend the rest of my life?

584
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,820
Are you breaking up with Zhang Qiming?

585
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,020
With your level of understanding,

586
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,140
can you just stay quiet?

587
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,820
Let Aiping finish.

588
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,660
Lately, I've been dreaming

589
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,100
about our days

590
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,300
at the factory.

591
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,140
Back then,

592
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,860
every day was on purpose.

593
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,740
I felt so full of energy

594
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,620
and a sense of fulfillment.

595
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,820
I was happy.

596
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:19,660
Yeah.

597
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,180
Back then,

598
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,660
we were so young.

599
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,140
Do you remember?

600
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,100
The factory had that

601
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,260
technical...

602
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:35,180
evaluation, right?

603
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,500
Aiping, your workshop
received the award, right?

604
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,260
What was

605
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,220
the award again?

606
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,700
The award...

607
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,820
What was it?

608
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,740
I forgot.

609
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,020
The award?

610
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,140
The award is...

611
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,140
our workshop was allowed to work

612
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,500
an extra hour compared to the others.

613
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,860
What kind of award is that?

614
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,660
But back then,

615
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,380
it felt so honorable.

616
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,300
I really felt valued.

617
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,520
Look at the factory now.

618
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,940
Everything that could be sold
has been sold,

619
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,540
even the land.

620
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:21,900
It feels like

621
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:23,900
we'll only see it

622
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,860
in our dreams now.

623
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,100
I don't even know who bought it.

624
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,220
When will we be able to visit again?

625
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,020
It's locked. We can't get in.

626
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,540
It's raining harder.

627
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,140
Should we head back?

628
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,620
Yeah, let's head back.

629
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,300
Wait.

630
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,740
I know a place.

631
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,420
- Not here.
- You want to sneak in?

632
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,260
I remember there's a place
we could slip into.

633
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,100
Look!

634
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,060
Yes, yes, yes!

635
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,340
This is the place!

636
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,460
- It really is!
- Remember?

637
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,380
Let me relive it a bit.

638
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,610
- Go ahead.
- Be careful.

639
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:19,600
Give me the umbrella.

640
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,620
One, two, three, go.

641
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,940
Be careful.

642
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,260
- Be careful.
- Get inside.

643
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,100
Aiping,

644
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,420
I remember this gap.

645
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,300
It wasn't this narrow before, was it?

646
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,660
This is thanks to your Zhang Qiming.

647
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,660
He used to sneak out scraps to sell.

648
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,420
- Do you remember?
- That's nonsense.

649
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,500
I don't remember that.

650
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,020
Back then, Aiping was

651
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,540
a March 8th Red Flag Bearer.

652
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,260
Who would have guessed she'd end up with

653
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,740
Zhang Qiming, a shady character...

654
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,020
Who would have guessed?

655
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,260
I used to work

656
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,180
in planning, right?

657
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,420
And now?

658
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,140
I'm just calculating

659
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,340
the price of pork and flour,

660
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,100
and losing money.

661
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,300
The factory really becomes rundown.

662
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,060
Everyone's left.

663
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,820
The factory used to run 24/7

664
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,140
with over 7,000 people.

665
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,860
The lights

666
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,900
were always on.

667
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,460
I remember,

668
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,060
the road to work

669
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,820
was packed with people,

670
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,260
all the bicycles

671
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,580
ringing their bells,

672
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,020
"Make way, make way."

673
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,860
The sound on that road

674
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,940
was even louder than the factory noise.

675
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,540
Now

676
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,100
there's no one.

677
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,300
Everything that needed
to be torn down is gone.

678
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,260
This road seems

679
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,220
narrower than it used to be.

680
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,500
Back then, the workshop was so big

681
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,840
and full of energy,

682
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,140
with everyone working together.

683
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,860
Now it's so quiet.

684
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,980
The noise was so loud...

685
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,100
Back then, after work,

686
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,060
I'd rush out

687
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,860
of your workshop,

688
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,740
and take a shower at the bathhouse.

689
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,700
Then I'd look for Dagui
in the canteen. Remember?

690
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,740
Yeah, you were always
rushing to find Dagui.

691
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,260
He was your type.

692
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,140
What are you saying?

693
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,300
No, no.

694
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,700
The bathhouse was

695
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,300
by the fifth workshop, right?

696
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,740
And ahead,

697
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,900
there was

698
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,900
the nursery

699
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,900
and the medical office, right?

700
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,620
- The nursery?
- Yes.

701
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,020
Yes, the nursery.

702
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,420
I'd drop Han off

703
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,340
at the nursery before work

704
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,660
and pick him up after.

705
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:32,860
Yes, yes.

706
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,060
Back then,

707
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,540
I didn't have to prepare baby formula.

708
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,140
The factory has it.

709
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,180
It felt like

710
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,500
the factory had everything.

711
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,020
Canteens,

712
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:41,860
infirmaries,

713
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,140
nurseries,

714
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,340
bathhouses...

715
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,940
Everything.

716
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,500
Now, where can you find
a workplace like that?

717
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,780
Look over there!

718
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,780
That was

719
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,100
where we used to watch outdoor movies.

720
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,460
Pei, do you remember?

721
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,820
I used to hand out the tickets.

722
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,940
Of course, I remember!

723
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,420
In the summer, we could

724
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,500
grab a bottle

725
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,340
of orange soda from the canteen.

726
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,020
And salted ice pops!

727
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,300
And then you'd ask Dagui

728
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,020
for a bottle of salted soda...

729
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,420
Pei.

730
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,620
Xiu'e.

731
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:48,300
How about we
apply to be flight attendants?

732
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,620
What?

733
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,860
Have you been possessed by her?

734
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,020
What's wrong with me?

735
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,340
She's possessed by you.

736
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,220
She's going crazy.

737
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,060
When did I ever go crazy?

738
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,460
I'm not kidding.

739
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,060
Just think about it,

740
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,780
if we could go back to being sixteen,

741
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,660
and they were hiring flight attendants,

742
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,260
would you dare to apply?

743
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,940
Sixteen?

744
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,740
I would.

745
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,140
You would?

746
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,820
When I was sixteen,

747
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,700
I wasn't as heavy as I am now.

748
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,660
So of course, I'd dare!

749
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,780
Then let's go apply right now.

750
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,820
What's there to be afraid of?

751
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,580
- Sure!
- Sure!

752
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,420
Go!

753
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,660
What?

754
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,500
Recording?

755
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,740
Looking good?

756
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,420
(Jiale Wontons)

757
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,180
Don't hide.

758
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:09,980
Zhang Qiming! You...

759
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,900
You're recording!

760
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,660
Who told you to record?

761
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,140
Aiping asked me to record.

762
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,740
Yes. You see,

763
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,780
we usually

764
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,420
can't see our own problems.

765
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,780
I asked Qiming

766
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,820
to help record,

767
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,340
then we can watch it on TV.

768
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,500
This way, the problems will be clear,

769
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,740
and we can adjust in time.

770
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,780
Well said!

771
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,020
The spirit of the March 8th
Red Flag Bearer is back.

772
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:38,860
Saw that?

773
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,060
Mr. Liu,

774
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,500
are you ready?

775
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,740
Ready!

776
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:44,900
Mr. Liu?

777
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,380
Which Mr. Liu?

778
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,980
I thought about it,

779
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,020
and among us,

780
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,580
Liu Songming has
the most stage experience.

781
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,260
Does that even count as stage experience?

782
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,780
Let me ask you,

783
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,740
what does it take to be a flight attendant?

784
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,020
Professionalism.

785
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,060
Confidence.

786
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,100
Figure.

787
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,620
Connections.

788
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:17,780
It's...

789
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,940
posture.

790
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,460
Look at you.

791
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,980
Even "poster" is coming out, huh?

792
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,300
I'm not talking about "poster".

793
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,140
Yeah.

794
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,980
Just look at
those flight attendants on TV.

795
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,500
They pick up small suitcases,

796
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,540
walk a few steps,

797
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,340
and the aura is there!

798
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,340
The energy shifts instantly!

799
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,180
Right?

800
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,220
See?

801
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,900
As for posture,

802
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,260
I, Liu Songming, am the expert.

803
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,780
The key is...

804
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,380
to relax

805
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,220
your whole body.

806
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,660
Your head should be held high.

807
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,660
Try to feel it.

808
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,820
You should

809
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,420
imagine yourselves being a roast duck,

810
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,660
hanging up!

811
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,820
Enough!

812
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,780
What nonsense is this?

813
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,140
Now even roast ducks are involved!

814
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,260
I'm not talking nonsense.

815
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,110
Watch me.

816
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,380
Listen to the teacher first.

817
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,220
Now, extend your hands like this.

818
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,020
Isn't that graceful?

819
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:11,720
Right?

820
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,380
Isn't your temperament instantly better?

821
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,220
Now, walk.

822
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,540
One, two, three.

823
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,940
Look at how he's swiveling his hips!

824
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,300
Am I right?

825
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,580
Let's practice!

826
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,420
- Come on, practice.
- One, two, three, go!

827
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,180
Puff your chest.

828
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,140
Don't just look at your steps!

829
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,060
Walk slowly, slowly.

830
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,100
Look at how your feet move.

831
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,420
Twist.

832
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,380
Can I walk like this?

833
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:40,860
So hard.

834
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,340
Pay attention.

835
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,540
Walk in a straight line.

836
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:02,940
Next one.

837
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,850
Sir,

838
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,740
may I see your boarding pass?

839
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:10,260
May I see your boarding,

840
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,380
sir?

841
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,180
Boarding is not enough.

842
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,890
May I see your boarding pass,

843
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:16,500
sir...

844
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,780
You need to use a questioning tone.

845
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:19,780
Sir?

846
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,580
Correct!

847
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,700
Another reward for you.

848
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,780
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

849
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,140
Boarding.

850
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,700
Correct?

851
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,100
Correct.

852
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,140
Pass!

853
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,060
Mom, your English has such a strong...

854
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,280
Not your breath.

855
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,340
It's a Northeast accent.

856
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:40,980
A Northeast accent?

857
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,620
That's going to be tough...

858
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,560
Don't worry.

859
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,420
Repeat after me.

860
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,380
Boarding.

861
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,700
Boarding.

862
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:48,980
- Correct!
- Yes!

863
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,100
Pass.

864
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,220
Pass!

865
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,220
Pass.

866
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,220
Pass!

867
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,260
Pass!

868
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,700
So, I was right. Pass!

869
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:57,860
Pass...

870
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,380
Okay, okay. Okay.

871
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,220
Read the first sentence

872
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,620
as a whole.

873
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:10,180
Your pass...

874
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,340
Take it out... Let me...

875
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,540
See... see.

876
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,540
Wrong for "pass"!

877
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,260
And wrong for "see see"!

878
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,220
Never mind.

879
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,860
Baby, where are you going?

880
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,070
Half an hour...

881
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,860
Mom, I've been teaching you
for half an hour,

882
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,780
and you still can't get two words right!

883
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,540
I'll learn it right away.

884
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,540
I will!

885
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,300
Baby, persistence is key!

886
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,420
Mom,

887
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,620
just stop persisting.

888
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,340
Alright.

889
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,460
What's this fruit?

890
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,780
Apple.

891
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,740
How do you say the juice made from it?

892
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,020
Just remember...

893
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,980
apple juice.

894
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:03,860
Why?

895
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:06,060
Because God-grandma likes apples.

896
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,460
Her other name sounds like apple.

897
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,130
So when you think of her,
think of apples.

898
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,340
And the juice? Apple juice.

899
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,140
Apple juice!

900
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,140
That's a good method.

901
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:14,980
Godmother.

902
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:16,540
Now, watermelon juice.

903
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,540
Repeat after me.

904
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,700
Watermelon juice.

905
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,700
Watermelon juice.

906
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,340
How to memorize it... Watermelon...

907
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,660
My head is gone!

908
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,660
No, no!

909
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,540
That's too bloody!

910
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,460
Bloody? Exactly!

911
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,760
What color is blood? Red, right?

912
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,140
So is the flesh of watermelon.

913
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,260
It matches!

914
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,940
I'll never drink watermelon juice again.

915
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,140
Mrs. Xiao.

916
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,860
How do you pronounce orange juice?

917
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,380
Orange juice.

918
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,500
Very standard!

919
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,980
Han taught me that yesterday.

920
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,500
Impressive.

921
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,740
Oh, Mr. Zhang,

922
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,220
there's one I didn't catch.

923
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,620
Tomato.

924
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:57,420
How do you say tomato juice?

925
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,060
Tomato...

926
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,180
tomato juice is just tomato juice.

927
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,260
The pronunciation is...

928
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,260
Enough, enough. Mao Tou, stop teaching us

929
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,540
about fruit juices.

930
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,580
Why not teach us
something more practical?

931
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,580
Exactly.

932
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,900
We want to be flight attendants.

933
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,460
We won't need to know this stuff.

934
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:12,580
How come?

935
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,860
Don't you have to serve drinks

936
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,060
to passengers on the plane?

937
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,060
When you ask them,

938
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,540
how do you do it? Answer me.

939
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,620
Excuse me, sir.

940
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,540
Do you want anything to drink?

941
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,500
Apple juice,

942
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,180
orange juice,

943
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,940
watermelon juice,

944
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,180
hot tea, or coffee?

945
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:34,140
Which one do you prefer?

946
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,140
Do you what?

947
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,300
Prefer.

948
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,780
Prefer?

949
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,660
Han taught me that.

950
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,780
He said

951
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,340
using "prefer" here sounds better

952
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,300
than "want".

953
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,140
It's...

954
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,980
more native.

955
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,460
Impressive, Aiping!

956
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,300
A divine text!

957
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:57,540
(Shanghai Puyang No. 2 Middle School)

958
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,460
Air stewardess?

959
00:38:59,100 --> 00:38:59,940
Yeah.

960
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,580
With my mom's abilities,

961
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,940
I have no idea what she's thinking.

962
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,300
Qian Jiayue,

963
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,180
at least your mom...

964
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,440
Right?

965
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,300
My mom...

966
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,700
She's just jumping on the bandwagon.

967
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,560
But what if they get selected?

968
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,100
Being a flight attendant would be great!

969
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,380
Good pay, a decent job,

970
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,620
nice uniforms,

971
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,340
and you get to travel abroad
all the time.

972
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,820
Why isn't my mom applying?

973
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,780
If my mom gets selected,

974
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,540
she'll make more money than my dad.

975
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,980
Then my mom and I won't have to

976
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,420
deal with my dad's mood anymore!

977
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:31,980
That's why

978
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,340
I think

979
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,140
your mom and Mrs. Xiao

980
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,020
are the two who should definitely apply.

981
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,380
Does Xiao Han support his mom?

982
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:40,860
He does.

983
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,620
I heard Mrs. Xiao learns English

984
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,220
so quickly and seriously,

985
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,620
unlike my mom,

986
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,680
who just babbles on

987
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,820
and still can't get it right.

988
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,660
By the way, Ka Men,

989
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,600
did you sign up

990
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,820
for the English host selection?

991
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:52,900
Did you?

992
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,900
Not yet.

993
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,820
Didn't you say
you'd sign up a long time ago?

994
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,500
I won't sign up

995
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,710
unless I lose 5 kg!

996
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,380
Qian Jiayue, Chen Mo,

997
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,180
you both need to supervise me

998
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,460
- Okay.
- and be strict with me.

999
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,100
Then... ten squats.

1000
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,300
Fifteen!

1001
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,460
Okay.

1002
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,900
One.

1003
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,140
Wait.

1004
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,380
Two.

1005
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,530
Three.

1006
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,220
Four?

1007
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,100
What's going on?

1008
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,260
Let's take a break.

1009
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,700
One, two, three.

1010
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,700
Curl your hands... Pose!

1011
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,390
Bring your feet together.

1012
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,260
One.

1013
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:16,700
Two.

1014
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,180
Three.

1015
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,660
Cross your legs.

1016
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:24,460
Open. Push your hands. Curl them!

1017
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:25,980
Look.

1018
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,020
Good!

1019
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,380
Pei.

1020
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,500
Pei?

1021
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,200
You're here.

1022
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:36,620
You are...

1023
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,540
I... I'm here to pick up
the recommendation letter.

1024
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,620
The stamp for the letter
is already on it.

1025
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,060
Follow me, I'll give it to you.

1026
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,970
You're responding to the 4050 Initiative

1027
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:47,900
to be an air stewardess.

1028
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,860
We definitely support you.

1029
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,420
(Jiale Wontons)
Glad to have you. This is Sunny Club.

1030
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,900
At the end of the program,

1031
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,060
as usual, we'll read
a letter from a viewer.

1032
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,540
A student named Tianyou
from Putuo District

1033
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,860
wants to share his recent study insights.

1034
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:04,940
"This semester,

1035
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,420
I've focused on the subjects I'm not good at.

1036
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,540
In Chinese subject,
besides mastering the content

1037
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:10,620
in the textbook..."

1038
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,460
I'm back.

1039
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:13,820
Keep going.

1040
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,460
Pei,

1041
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,660
you're not cooking, right?

1042
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:17,900
I won't either.

1043
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,460
I'm heading to Food Republic for dinner.

1044
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:24,700
Where's your mom?

1045
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,540
She's not home.

1046
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:26,580
Where did she go?

1047
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,180
I don't know.

1048
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,220
You're back.

1049
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,460
What did you buy?

1050
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,340
Did you go to the mall?

1051
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,860
It says "clothing".

1052
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,260
Clothing, huh?

1053
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,700
It isn't for me, though.

1054
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,860
What is it for?

1055
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,140
The air stewardess selection.

1056
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:54,940
Seriously?

1057
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,780
That color will make you look bigger!

1058
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,020
What's wrong?

1059
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,020
I'm not wrong.

1060
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:22,930
That color will definitely
make her look bigger.
