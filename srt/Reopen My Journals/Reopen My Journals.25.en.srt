Mr. Chen.

26
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:57,830
Mr. Chen,

27
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,420
I really hope

28
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,140
you'll reconsider.

29
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,750
After all, everything is

30
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,340
based on your assumptions.

31
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,780
Mr. Zhou,

32
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:10,830
Momo's transfer

00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,420
is a family decision.

34
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,950
She's about to enter

35
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,180
her senior year,

36
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,830
and this year is crucial for her.

37
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,300
I don't want her

38
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,950
to go down the wrong path again.

39
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,830
Thank you. Goodbye.

Qian,

41
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,730
once we get to the police station,

42
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:51,990
wait for me.

43
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,180
I'll be out quickly.

44
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,830
Okay.

45
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,390
Sorry. Really sorry.

46
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,700
I truly apologize for causing you

47
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,340
(Puyang Police Station)
so much trouble.

48
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,390
Please take the money.

49
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:24,670
And,

50
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,410
if there are

51
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,580
any issues

52

00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,830
you have my contact info.

54
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:31,830
Just give me a call,

55
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:32,790
and I won't avoid it.

56
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,190
Alright. My brother
is still in the hospital.

57
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,270
If anything comes up,

58
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,000
I'll get in touch with you!

59
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,460
I'm really sorry.

60
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,420
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:45,830
Goodbye.

62
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,190
Mom,

63
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,700
you packed up Dad's stuff…

64
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,300
Are you really going to divorce him?

65
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,390
Do you want to be transferred?

66
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,040
No.

67
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,720
Then do you want me

68
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,300
and your dad to be divorced?

69
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,470
All these years,

70
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,260
our lives have revolved around your dad.

71
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,150
From the bottom of my heart,
I feel like I owe you.

72
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,030
So this time,

73
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,350
I won't back down from him.

74
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,060
Mom,

75
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,820
I've always had a question.

76
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,740
Why did you marry Dad?

77
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,260
His temper is awful,

78
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:17,710
and he's unreasonable.

79
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,030
What do you think?

80
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,350
Because…

81
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,030
he has money?

82
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,990
Your dad didn't have money

83
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,420
when he was young.

84
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,230
He came from a bad background

85
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,230
and was looked down on.

86
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,340
He finished middle school
and went to Xinjiang.

87
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,150
After he passed
the college entrance exam,

88
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,500
he returned to Shanghai,

89
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,230
and that's when we got married.

90
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:49,870
Back then,

91
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,110
all we had

92
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,070
was your grandma's

93
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,150
8-square-meter room.

94
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:57,550
Four of us lived there.

95
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,190
But…

96
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,110
Your dad has

97
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,910
many shortcomings,

98
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,110
but he truly is

99
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:09,910
a very responsible man.

100
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,350
Over the years,

101
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,990
to protect you

102
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,300
and our family,

103
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,030
he's endured a lot.

104
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,990
He has really

105
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,180
given his all.

106
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,260
In that regard,

107
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,380
he's far better

108
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,380
than my father

109
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:28,740
and brother.

110
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,670
First it was the hospital,

111
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,500
now it's the police station!

112
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,620
- Brother-in-law, I…
- You keep getting into fights!

113
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,500
Do you think fighting solves anything?

114
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,470
Your mom's getting older,

115
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:43,740
and has a bad heart.

116
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,860
Your wife, besides
looking after your mom,

117
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,470
works at the supermarket.

118
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,940
She's running around non-stop!

119
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,030
If you're really a man,

120
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,260
think about them!

121
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:59,790
If you do this again,

122
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,150
you'll rot in there and never come out.

123
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,190
Understand?

124
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,390
This time…

125
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,550
Please don't tell Lingling.

126
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:08,740
She's pregnant…

127
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,030
You do know about that, huh?

128
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,500
I'll tell her

129
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,910
you ran an errand for me in Hangzhou.

130
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,790
That will do, right?

131
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,660
Thank you!

132
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,890
I've found you a job

133
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,380
in my company's logistics department.

134
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,300
Just do that for now.

135
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,550
Don't cause any more trouble!

136
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,590
This will be my last favor.

137
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,190
And

138
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,440
your sister doesn't know about this.

139
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,710
Don't slip up when you see her.

140
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,260
Got it?

141
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,620
Got it, brother-in-law.

142
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,460
Go now.

143
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:44,750
Goodbye, Pengyu.

144
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,030
So that's Fangfang's younger brother?

145
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,340
Funny thing,

146
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,990
this irresponsible brother of hers

147
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,180
was kind of my matchmaker.

148
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,420
My family had a bad background.

149
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,110
To keep my brother
with my mom in Shanghai,

150
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,550
I went to Xinjiang for work.

151
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,940
One year when I came home,

152
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,490
my brother and Fangfang's brother,

153
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,420
just that guy,

154
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,260
got into a fight

155
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,820
and ended up in the hospital.

156
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,860
That's when I met Zhao Rongfang.

157
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,300
It was late at night.

158
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,030
I was

159
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,110
starving.

160
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,860
She saw how pitiful I looked,

161
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,140
and secretly took half a steamed bun,

162
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,190
wrapped it in newspaper,
and gave it to me.

163
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,830
So you could say

164
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,060
"fighting led to friendship".

165
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,030
Exactly.

166
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,030
Later on,

167
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:42,660
I went to their home

168
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,310
to apologize.

169
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,470
When I saw how poor

170
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,430
her family was,

171
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,230
I wanted to repay her.

172
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:53,860
I decided

173
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,310
to do some work for her family.

174
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,380
Fixing the roof,

175
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,190
making coal cakes,

176
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:01,670
repairing

177
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,550
furniture,

178
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,620
whatever needed doing.

179
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,380
So that's how

180
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,430
you won her over?

181
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,430
No, no.

182
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,310
That wasn't my goal.

183
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,190
Don't forget,

184
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,590
I had to go back to Xinjiang.

185
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,110
Think about it,

186
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,040
could I

187
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,140
really ask a girl
to leave a good place like Shanghai

188
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,260
and follow me to Xinjiang?

189
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,310
I could not.

190
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,350
But unexpectedly,

191
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,620
right before I left,

192
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,310
Zhao Rongfang came to my house

193
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,740
and asked for my address in Xinjiang.

194
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,540
After that, she wrote to me

195
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,950
for four years!

196
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:37,980
A pile of letters!

197
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:42,550
Momo,

198
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,830
when you like someone,

199
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,830
it's easy to see all their good sides.

200
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,350
But over time,

201
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,430
their flaws

202
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,020
start showing up.

203
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,340
Sometimes,

204
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,710
a person's good qualities

205
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,830
are also their flaws.

206
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,620
Take your dad for example.

207
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,710
He is arbitrary

208
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,990
and chauvinistic,

209
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,740
but on the other hand,

210
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,620
he's responsible

211
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,310
and reliable.

212
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,780
You're still defending him.

213
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,340
Actually…

214
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,110
you still like Dad,

215
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,260
and you don't want to divorce him,

216
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,580
do you?

217
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,010
Do you know what Zhao Rongfang said to me

218
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:30,900
when we got married?

219
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,310
She must have said

220
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,620
she fell for you

221
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,380
at first sight, right?

222
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,590
It wasn't that cheesy.

223
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,740
She said

224
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:43,830
her dad

225
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,950
and brother were both big gamblers,

226
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,780
and she wanted to take a gamble on me.

227
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,930
I asked her what she meant.

228
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,070
She said, "I'm betting…

229
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,620
that you'll treat me well

230
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,860
and give me a great life."

231
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,830
It's been

232
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,590
over a decade,

233
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,950
and I still think about

234
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,590
what she said all the time.

235
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,260
Maybe one day

236
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,140
I should ask her,

237
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,140
"Did you win the bet or not?"

238
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,230
You are my bottom line.

239
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,190
Even if one day

240
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,110
your dad and I
really have no other choice,

241
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,780
I'll just admit to losing the bet.

242
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,190
I've told you all about

243
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,740
my unhappiness.

244
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,070
What about you?

245
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,350
Shouldn't you tell me

246
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,110
about your little troubles,

247
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,140
thoughts,

248
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,350
and secrets too?

249
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,500
Han, dinner's ready.

250
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,190
I made your favorite,

251
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,500
stir-fried beef with chili.

252
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,310
I'm not hungry.

253
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,740
You guys eat first.

254
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:23,790
Leave it to me.

255
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:24,980
I've got it.

256
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:33,910
Come in.

257
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,190
I'm coming in now.

258
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:43,740
I'm not hungry.

259
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,380
I'll just leave it here.

260
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,740
How about we

261
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,190
talk for a bit?

262
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,230
Don't worry about your mom.

263
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,680
I've got that covered.

264
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,850
But don't blame her

265
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,220
for asking you so many questions.

266
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,020
She's worried

267
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,230
about you two starting to

268
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,350
have feelings for each other

269
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,190
and not knowing how to handle it.

270
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,500
That could

271
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,710
hurt you both.

272
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,310
So,

273
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,190
are you worried about Jiayue,

274
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,500
or...

275
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,950
Mr. Zhang,

276
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,710
I went to Jiayue's home this afternoon.

277
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,830
I'll sit down.

278
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,220
What happened after?

279
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,140
But her mom

280
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:48,500
wouldn't let me see her.

281
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,180
That crazy woman.

282
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,020
At least this time
she's thinking straight.

283
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,020
It's actually logical.

284
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,340
Think about it,

285
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,530
seeing her helps nothing.

286
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,430
If you did meet,

287
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,950
what would you say to her?

288
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,190
What could you do?

289
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,030
You are

290
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,430
a responsible

291
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,310
and reliable person.

292
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,380
You want no one

293
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,310
to get hurt because of you.

294
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,430
To be honest,

295
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,110
this problem is tough indeed.

296
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,350
Two tips

297
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,190
for reference only.

298
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,150
The first one,

299
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,020
give Jiayue some time.

300
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,660
Believe that she can overcome this.

301
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,610
The second one,

302
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:26,550
which is more crucial,

303
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,140
is for you and Chen Mo.

304
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,780
What's your exact plan

305
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,620
for the future.

306
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,430
Have you thought it through?

307
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,340
Really…

308
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,380
is that all?

309
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,380
Yes.

310
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,370
I don't know what to do anymore.

311
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,540
Qian Jiayue is the first

312
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,140
real friend I've made here.

313
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,710
I don't want to lose her.

314
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,390
As for Xiao Han…

315
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,560
I've never

316
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,430
felt this way about anyone before.

317
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,950
You heard me earlier,

318
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,380
I'm trying hard to hold back,

319
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,900
but why is it so hard?

320
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,620
Momo,

321
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,710
feelings during your school years

322
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,620
are the purest,

323
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:20,830
the most beautiful.

324
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,340
But

325
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,310
protecting that purity and beauty

326
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,340
takes

327
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,580
strength,

328
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,580
courage,

329
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:29,990
and wisdom.

330
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,220
Do you think

331
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,900
you have those?

332
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:36,900
Does that mean

333
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,590
once I grow up,

334
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,020
I'll have these qualities,

335
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,780
and things will be easier?

336
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,590
Of course not.

337
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,830
When you grow up,
there will be more challenges,

338
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,350
one after the other.

339
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,260
But by then,

340
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,500
you'll have

341
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,860
more experience, and more wisdom.

342
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,830
At least,

343
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:55,980
your heart

344
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,110
will be more prepared.

345
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,550
Right?

346
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,140
Now, stop overthinking it.

347
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,350
Well, I've been through this.

348
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,620
I can speak from experience.

349
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,110
You see, you'll be facing
the College Entrance Exam

350
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,310
in a little over a year.

351
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:19,790
About 400 days.

352
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,180
It'll pass by

353
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,170
in the blink of an eye.

354
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:23,790
Time flies.

355
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:24,790
Look at

356
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:25,780
Comrade Guan Aiping.

357
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,660
I've been waiting for her for years.

358
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,190
You can't rush things.

359
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,740
One important thing is,

360
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,020
even if you are able

361
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,620
to balance everything,

362
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,220
what about her?

363
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,590
Will she improve

364
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,700
or get worse?

365
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,710
If you truly care about her,

366
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,430
you need to think about her too.

367
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,830
Last but not least is that

368
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,470
no matter what,

369
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,020
don't skip meals.

370
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,740
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

371
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,270
No problem.

372
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:05,990
Thank you!

373
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,150
I'm just happy we could talk.

374
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:17,790
How's he doing?

375
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,300
He's eating well now.

376
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,630
That's great.

377
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:26,990
Let's eat too.

378
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:27,830
Alright.

379
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,190
The kid

380
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,740
is growing up,

381
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,390
but some things…

382
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,430
Just like you said,
the kid is growing up.

383
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,500
We should trust that he can handle it.

384
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,010
Thanks to you for being here that day.

385
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,230
As a string, I'm glad

386
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,820
to be of help.

387
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,100
What? As a string?

388
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,580
Seeing you're down,

389
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,630
I haven't shown you this.

390
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,500
You said "A broken string is hard to repair".

391
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,340
I want to make a promise to you.

392
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,910
Even if you've

393
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,390
broken five or six strings,

394
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,740
seven or eight, it's fine.

395
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,020
I've got plenty of strings here.

396
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,340
If one breaks, we just replace it.

397
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,660
(Guqin strings)

398
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,810
What are you talking about?

399
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,140
Aiping,

400
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,390
I read your...

401
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:17,950
poem.

402
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:19,790
I…

403
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,740
I get it.

404
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:22,780
I know you went to

405
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:23,820
Longhua because of

406
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,950
Youguang, right?

407
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,300
I know that

408
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,870
in your heart, I'm not good enough.

409
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,190
But... here's my

410
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,300
promise to you,

411
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,020
I, Zhang Qiming…

412
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,620
Qiming,

413
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,020
you misunderstood.

414
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,540
I went to Longhua

415
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,230
for an event organized by Doctor Zhan.

416
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,580
And this poem isn't mine, it was written

417
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,300
by Xin Qiji.

418
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,910
Xin Qiji? Not one of our old friends

419
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,390
from No. 9 Factory, right?

420
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,710
How did you meet him?

421
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,260
We met through

422
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,990
someone named Li Qingzhao.

423
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,230
What...

424
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,540
What's with this Li person?

425
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,300
Why introduce you to him?

426
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,540
Stop talking and come eat.

427
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,100
Is there really someone surnamed Xin?

428
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,710
If I were surnamed Xin,

429
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,230
I'd call myself Xin Ku.
[*Xin Ku: Hardworking]

430
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,330
I think it's Xin Siduo.
[*Xin Siduo: Thoughtful]

431
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,990
Thoughtful, huh?

432
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,500
I like that. Sounds just right.

433
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,220
(Jinxiu Garden)

434
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,630
You've actually packed my stuff?

435
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:04,820
How are you

436
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,300
thinking about transfer?

437
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,340
The transfer is a must!

438
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,230
It's the best way

439
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,390
to protect our daughter.

440
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,100
How's everything?

441
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,360
(Sailor: How's everything? Want to chat?)

442
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,400
(I found an interesting article. Hello?)

443
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,420
(I had an interesting thing. Are you back?)

444
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,470
Maybe

445
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,660
I should look up a joke for her.

446
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,580
(Title)

447
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:07,680
Beautiful woman wardrobe malfunction…

448
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,520
What are you looking at?

449
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,580
Nothing.

450
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,780
Really?

451
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,630
Really.

452
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:46,860
Are you sure?

453
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:47,790
Yes.

454
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:54,300
"Beautiful woman wardrobe malfunction".

455
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,260
"Beautiful"? "Wardrobe malfunction"?

456
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,470
You call that "Nothing"?

457
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,500
No way out now, huh?

458
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,500
You think you're Ip Man?

459
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,630
Little imp!

460
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:02,710
Click on it.

461
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,390
You really want to see those pictures?

462
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,230
Click on it!

463
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,380
I'll do it.

464
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,180
No beautiful woman?

465
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,180
(Proof with images! Rare wardrobe
malfunction pictures of beautiful women!)

466
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:26,340
(They're all gone. Really, all gone.
There's no one left.)

467
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,950
They're all gone. Really, all gone.

468
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:29,950
There's no one left.

469
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,150
Is this really...

470
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,740
What else could it be?

471
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,190
I was just looking for a joke.

472
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,430
You're so naive for hitting me for it.

473
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,190
You're a repeat offender!

474
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,710
Of course I have to keep an eye on you.

475
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,580
How did I become a repeat offender?

476
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,100
You're so harsh.

477
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,340
Let me tell you,

478
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:49,690
Brother Xiao Han is the one
who's really guilty now.

479
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:50,570
But you

480
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:51,780
won't say anything about him.

481
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,580
Han…

482
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,150
He's older than you!

483
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,470
He's an adult!

484
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,390
Stop looking at beauties,

485
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:00,580
or it'll stunt your growth!

486
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:02,860
Why's that?

487
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,670
Because I'll break your legs!

488
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,320
Now that's a real funny joke!

489
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,210
You have no idea
what a joke is, little imp!

490
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,500
You're the joke.

493
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,470
why aren't you asleep so late?

494
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,910
I'm watching the moon.

495
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,190
Come, join me.

496
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,300
Come sit with me.

497
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:05,710
Look, tonight's moon

498
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,020
is so bright, isn't it?

499
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,420
Jiayue,

500
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:22,710
I know that

501
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,580
you're not

502
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,500
just physically unwell,

503
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,420
but your heart...

504
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,780
is also troubled.

505
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,310
Granny.

506
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,580
I truly hate myself being like this now.

507
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,020
Indecisive.

508
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,020
Narrow-minded and disagreeable.

509
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,710
The current version of me

510
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,630
is not good at all.

511
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:54,780
Who says that?

512
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,260
I think you're doing just fine.

513
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,070
Look,

514
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,470
the moon…

515
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,580
it's always high up in the sky, right?

516
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,820
But its light

517
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:13,820
doesn't just reach

518
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,430
the high mountains

519
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,340
and long rivers.

520
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:17,900
It also

521
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:18,910
shines on

522
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,910
the small flowers and grass.

523
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:27,390
As long as a small flower

524
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,390
or grass grows in this world,

525
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,740
it will definitely feel

526
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,580
the light of the moon,

527
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,670
and that will surely bring

528
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,780
joy to others.

how happy our whole family

532
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,390
has been

533
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,470
since you

534
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,990
came into our lives!

535
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,630
So if…

536
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,780
if I grow into a big tree,

537
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,910
if I become better,

538
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,470
would you be even happier?

I don't want her

543

to go down the wrong path again.

544
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,420
What about her?

545
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,740
Will she improve

546
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:47,900
or get worse?

547
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,910
If you truly care about her,

548
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,580

00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:02,730
Coming to my place for lunch?

576
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,030
I...

577
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,630
I'm Zhang Qiming. Who else could I be?

578
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,580
Zhang Qiming?

579
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,500
You're Zhang Qiming?

580
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,070
Nonsense!

581
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:18,190
You're so old.

582
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,020
How could you be Zhang Qiming?

583
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:24,020
How old is Zhang Qiming then?

584
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,470
Zhang Qiming

585
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,580
is my neighbor's child.

586
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:30,950
I'm his godmother!

587
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,710
He just replaced his dad in the factory.

588
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,100
Eighteen!

589
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,150
How could it be you?

590
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:40,580
Zhang Qiming is eighteen?

591
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:42,740
How old are you then?

592
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:43,990
Forty-two.

593
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,740
I know you like to be complimented!

594
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,260
When I saw you in the alley back then,

595
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,000
you'd stop me
and make me shout three times,

596
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,300
"The flower of the alley,

597
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,580
Auntie is the prettiest!"

598
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,540
- before letting me go.
- You're so annoying!

599
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,740
I don't even know you.

600
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,950
Why are you talking to me like this?

601
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,470
It's not good to talk to strangers.

602
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,580
Little San,

603
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,870
why are you

604
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,390
staring at me today?

605
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:13,910
You look great today.

606
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,870
Come on, I'm always fine!

607
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:18,830
Qiming,

608
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,380
you should

609
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,500
pay more attention

610
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,990
to Mao Tou's studies.

611
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,990
He's in high school now,

612
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,500
and the pressure is big.

613
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:29,630
Auntie, do you remember
Mao Tou's in high school?

614
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,620
What's this talk?

615
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,470
I'm not senile.

616
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:37,670
Mao Tou's in his first year
of high school, right?

617
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:42,150
You're sharp now.

618
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,390
Of course, I'm sharp!

619
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,870
It's you who isn't so clear-headed!

620
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:49,230
Right, right.

621
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,540
Lunch's almost ready. Let's eat.

622
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:53,710
Qiming,

623
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,740
I bought lots of food today.

624
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,820
Stay and eat with us.

625
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:58,950
Wait, you bought it?

626
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,670
It was Qiming who bought it, alright?

627
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:03,390
Doesn't matter who bought it,

628
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:04,580
as long as it's tasty!

629
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,100
- Let's eat together.
- Okay.

630
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,270
I'll call you when it's ready.

631
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,500
Okay, okay.

632
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,580
What's going on?

633
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,950
Why are you being so secretive?

634
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,500
I don't believe it.

635
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,300
She seems normal to me.

636
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,390
Maybe she was just joking earlier.

637
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:31,260
I'd rather

638
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,190
she was joking with me.

639
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,300
But she's getting older, and taking her

640
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,780
to the hospital for a check-up

641
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,620
wouldn't hurt, right?

642
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,540
That does make sense.

643
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,710
Tomorrow, I'll have my schedule arranged.

644
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,070
I'll find a day

645
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,780
and trick her into seeing a doctor.

646
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,590
Why are you here?

647
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,540
How are you...

648
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,950
Are you feeling better, Qian Jiayue?

649
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,470
I'm feeling better now.

650
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:53,310
Do you still have a fever? Let me

651
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:54,150
feel your forehead.

652
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,340
No fever anymore.

653
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,700
Good.

654
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,140
Still feel uncomfortable anywhere?

655
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:01,990
I'm much better now.

656
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,640
Thanks for visiting me,

657
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:04,630
Chang Wuji.

658
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:05,980
No problem.

659
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:16,940
By the way.

660
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,540
I…

661
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:20,750
specially…

662
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:21,950
bought you…

663
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:23,660
your childhood favorite…

664
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:25,180
old-fashioned egg cake.

665
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:26,910
Try it.

666
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,100
When did I

667
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,660
ever like this kind of cake?

668
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:34,660
You loved it when you were little!

669
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,500
Don't you remember?

670
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,640
Old-fashioned egg cake.

671
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,580
By the way, Qian Jiayue,

672
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,990
I also brought you something.

673
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,590
These are the notes

674
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:53,710
I copied for you.

675
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,230
Thank you.

676
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:58,830
You're welcome.

677
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,180
These notes are so detailed.

678
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,830
Well, at first, I didn't take

679
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:07,660
all of the notes.

680
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,810
But later, I reached out

681
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:10,930
to Teacher Hu, Mr. Zhou,

682
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:11,910
Pei Dongni, and Xu You,

683
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:12,950
and they helped me

684
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,310
complete the rest.

685
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,420
Thank you.

686
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,340
No problem.

687
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:19,900
Alright,

688
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,470
the two of us

689
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,580
appreciate your help.

690
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,060
Jiayue and I

691
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,060
don't really have anything else
to thank you for.

692
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,700
It's getting late,

693
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:29,790
and we should eat.

694
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:31,390
Maybe it's time for you to head back?

695
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,020
Okay.

696
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:33,990
Wait, Chang Wuji.

697
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,160
Your stomach hasn't been well,

698
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:37,580
and your parents neglect you.

699
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,370
Have some to fill your stomach first.

700
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,500
Okay, I'll take one.

701
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:43,750
It's fine.

702
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:44,870
You can take all of them.

703
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,700
Thanks. Thanks.

704
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,100
Well, it's getting late.

705
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,390
If there's nothing else,

706
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,660
I'll head back now.

707
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:00,500
- Okay.
- Take care of yourself.

708
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,380
See you at school.

709
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,500
See you at school.

710
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:05,150
Leaving already?

711
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,540
- Bye.
- Bye.

712
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,830
Chang Wuji, let me walk you out!

713
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:22,390
What are you doing?

714
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:25,830
Give me the cakes back!

715
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,750
Qian Jiayue gave them to me.

716
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,310
It was meant for her!

717
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,310
Give them back!

718
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:31,660
But she gave them to me.

719
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,060
You're getting more bold.

720
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,570
Now you're coming to her home directly!

721
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,700
I came to deliver the notes

722
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,700
and homework.

723
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,540
Is that wrong?

724
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:45,500
I'll pay for the cakes.

725
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:49,180
Who wants your stinky money?

726
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,150
No? Fine.

727
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,650
I'll just give her the money myself.

728
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:54,150
Still going?

729
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,420
You like it so much?
Just take it and eat!

730
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,430
Just go! Go!

731
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,040
You're not welcomed here!

732
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:21,980
Here!

733
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:25,980
What is it?

734
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:29,790
Here.

735
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:35,500
College Entrance Exam
Countdown Study Plan?

736
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,890
Is your dad planning to change your school?

737
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,700
How did you know?

738
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,580
I saw him talking to Mr. Zhou at school.

739
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:49,750
How about…

740
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,090
I go speak with your dad?

741
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:52,370
I can talk it over with him

742
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,020
and persuade him not to transfer you.

743
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,510
Forget it.

744
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:56,830
You know how my dad is.

745
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,020
If he sees you,

746
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,270
he may tear you apart.

747
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:00,620
I'm not afraid!

748
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,700
Reason always works.

749
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,990
Besides, we haven't done anything wrong.

750
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,460
If that doesn't work,

751
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,140
I can show him the plan.

752
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,500
The Gaokao study plan,

753
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:18,790
I'll show him.

754
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:20,980
And

755
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,060
all the materials.

756
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,350
(Gaokao Math; Gaokao Chinese
New Question Types)

757
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:25,270
I'll guarantee him that

758
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:28,100
with these, your grades
will definitely improve,

759
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:33,700
and I won't affect

760
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:35,110
your studies or cause you

761
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,140
any distractions.

762
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:38,120
As long as he doesn't move you.

763
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,540
Honestly, I'm not too worried

764
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,990
about my dad transferring me.

765
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,270
My mom is firmly on my side,

766
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:56,540
and we'll sort it out.

767
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,350
What I'm really concerned about…

768
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,620
is Qian Jiayue.

769
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,350
I tried to find her…

770
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,180
but I didn't see her.

771
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,790
Mr. Zhang said

772
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:19,350
we should give her time,

773
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:21,600
and wait for her to come around.

774
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,060
My mom also said

775
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,540
that some things seem difficult now,

776
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:30,200
but with a little time,

777
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,020
things might turn around.

778
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,640
Actually, I was planning
to talk to you as well.

779
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:38,220
I want to tell you that

780
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,350
for now…

781
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:42,830
For now what?

782
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,540
Didn't you say it yourself?

783
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,500
Focus on studying first.

784
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:52,670
Right.

785
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:54,620
Focus on studying.

786
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,310
This is too much.

787
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,150
Chen Mo.

788
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,390
So, let's…

789
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,830
make a one-year promise.

790
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:21,310
What promise?

791
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,390
Come on!

792
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:57,110
Where did you go?

793
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,530
I asked you where you went!

794
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:12,230
Chen Mo,

795
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:14,540
don't think that
with your mom protecting you,

796
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,910
you can do whatever you want.

797
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,420
Dad,

798
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,310
I want to talk to you.

799
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:40,460
