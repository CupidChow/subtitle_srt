23

=Episode 31=

24
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,440
Mom,

25
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:56,770
today,

26
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,290
- my teachers...
- We already know

27
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:00,930
what happened at school.

28
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,720
Was it really your decision
to say all that?

29
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,120
It was a moment of desperation,

30
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,890
but I still chose to say it.

31
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,210
Mom, don't worry,

32
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,240
even without the extra 20 points,

33
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,520
I'll still get into the college.

34
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,120
Are you sure?

35
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:29,330
I'm sure!

36
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,210
That's good then.

37
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,120
I'll go make dinner.

38
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,680
No matter how urgent

39
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,680
the situation,

40
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,610
you shouldn't have chosen

41
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:46,720
a path that would harm you.

42
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,720
Those are twenty points!

43
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,210
It affects your Gaokao score.

44
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,610
Not even one point can be missed,

45
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,000
you silly child.

46
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,050
Are you letting it slide?

47
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,490
What else can we do?

48
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,210
You've heard him.

49
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,050
It's his decision,

50
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,330
and he'll have to
deal with the consequences.

51
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,450
But he just said it was

52
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,610
out of desperation.

53
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,680
That shows his decision

54
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,890
wasn't fully thought out.

55
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,170
Whether it was immaturity

56
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,400
or desperation,

57
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,280
it was still his choice.

58
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,170
Honestly,

59
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,490
we shouldn't treat him
like a child anymore.

60
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,000
He's grown up.

61
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,610
He's not the little kid

62
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,210
who would run to me

63
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:42,800
when something went wrong

64
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,960
and cry,

65
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,240
"Mom. Mom."

66
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,290
Well, no matter what,

67
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,210
I'm always ready.

68
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,050
The moment you say,

69
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:49,930
I'll rush to the school.

70
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,520
Forget

71
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,400
the school.

72
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,840
Now, wash these broccoli

73
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,960
and carrots for me.

74
00:03:58,890 --> 00:03:59,730
Okay.

75
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,240
He really said that

76
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,690
in front of all those teachers?

77
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,930
He gave up such an important honor

78
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,080
and the extra points?

79
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,930
What a pity.

80
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,680
But,

81
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,400
it was his choice,

82
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:42,760
so you don't need to feel

83
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,640
too burdened.

84
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,610
Actually, there's another reason

85
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,690
I haven't told you.

86
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,610
And I don't know how to tell him.

87
00:04:58,650 --> 00:04:59,490
Mom,

88
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,660
I don't want to stay here for college.

89
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,420
You don't want to stay in Shanghai?

90
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,260
Then…

91
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,420
where do you want to go?

92
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,260
Beijing.

93
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,300
Bei...

94
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,060
Beijing?

95
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,780
I knew you wouldn't agree,

96
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,220
so I was planning to tell you

97
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,540
after I made the decision.

98
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,540
As for Xiao Han,

99
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,580
I didn't get the chance to tell him,

100
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,420
and he...

101
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,820
What should I do now?

102
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,500
Momo,

103
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,700
from a mother's perspective,

104
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,980
I really want you to stay in Shanghai

105
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,420
to stay by my side.

106
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,660
That way,

107
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,020
Dad, Mom, and Xiao Han

108
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,060
would all be happy.

109
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,460
Please don't say that.

110
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,420
How about…

111
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,100
we leave it up to fate?

112
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,060
How?

113
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,180
We have a box of fries here.

114
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,140
Let's count them.

115
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,460
If it's an odd number,
you stay in Shanghai.

116
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,860
Otherwise, you go to Beijing.

117
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,860
This… seems too hasty.

118
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:27,860
But

119
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,300
sometimes when you're torn
between two choices,

120
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,820
you have to go with fate.

121
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,740
Alright…

122
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,060
You count them.

123
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,860
Okay.

124
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,380
Wait!

125
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,220
Odd number for Beijing,

126
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,580
even number for Shanghai.

127
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,700
Okay.

128
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,220
One.

129
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,780
Two.

130
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,020
Three.

131
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:51,980
Four.

132
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,260
Five.

133
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,260
Six.

134
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,380
Seven.

135
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,580
Eight. Nine.

136
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,460
Ten.

137
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,620
Eleven.

138
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:01,860
Twelve.

139
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,060
Thirteen.

140
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,700
Fourteen.

141
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,180
Fifteen.

142
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,220
Sixteen.

143
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,460
Seventeen…

144
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,500
Eighteen.

145
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:14,900
Look,

146
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,900
fate wants you to stay in Shanghai.

147
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,860
And now,

148
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,340
fate

149
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,860
has made me hungry.

150
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,020
There are only seventeen left.

151
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,260
Mom, you…

152
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,260
My silly child.

153
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,900
(Jiale Wontons)

154
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,040
Mom!

155
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,900
What happened?

156
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,460
What's going on?

157
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,260
What's wrong?

158
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,220
What's this?

159
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,860
Why is it under my desk leg?

160
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,780
- This…
- Chen Xiu'e!

161
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,460
- It's from Qian Jiayue's mom.
- Yes.

162
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,980
You know how she is…

163
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,300
she's not very clear-headed,

164
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,420
always bringing these
superstitious things!

165
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,300
- Right?
- Yes.

166
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,420
She said…

167
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,060
this

168
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,140
is for Qian Jiayue,

169
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,460
and she brought it to our restaurant

170
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,500
for us to see.

171
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,300
We criticized her for it.

172
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,420
I said,

173
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,980
"You can't keep doing this stuff!"

174
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,020
Right?

175
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,420
Then she left and

176
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,820
forgot to take it with her.

177
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,580
I don't know how it

178
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,660
ended up in your room.

179
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,940
- Yeah, how come?
- Right?

180
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,420
It's really my fault.

181
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,780
May I ask, dear Mom,

182
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,660
why does this

183
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,620
(Liu Wanqing)
have my name

184
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,380
and my birthday on it?

185
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,140
Dear Mom,

186
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,820
please don't tell me
you were fooled by this.

187
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,740
Can you stop being so paranoid?

188
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,180
Qing,

189
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,700
right now, it's not me being paranoid.

190
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,660
It's you who's being paranoid!

191
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,660
Yeah, yeah. Come on, sit down.

192
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,740
Qing,

193
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,580
let me tell you,

194
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,340
we are really worried about you.

195
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,180
Yeah.

196
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,820
Look at you, you're always saying

197
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,020
these strange things,

198
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,860
and your tone of voice

199
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,260
is like a ghost is possessing you.

200
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,460
We're so worried about you!

201
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,340
You're about to drive us mad!

202
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,540
Qing.

203
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,820
Qing…

204
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,700
Can't Chinese talismans

205
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,980
drive away foreign ghosts?

206
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,620
Doesn't the Jade Emperor

207
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,140
have any power?

208
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:07,940
See?

209
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,540
You've driven your mom crazy!

210
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,820
Actually, I wanted to...

211
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,260
wait until I passed the exam
before telling you.

212
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,780
What do you mean?

213
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,460
Dad.

214
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,820
Mom.

215
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,740
I'm preparing for the art exam, aiming at

216
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,420
STA's Directing Department.

217
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,580
- Art exam?
- Art exam?

218
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,740
You're back.

219
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,180
Where did you go?

220
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,780
You said you'd be back later.

221
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,620
I just took Momo out

222
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,780
for dinner

223
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,060
to relax a bit.

224
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,620
Time is so limited,

225
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,860
and you're relaxing?

226
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,420
The application deadline is near.

227
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,820
Momo, come, sit down.

228
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,020
Let's talk.

229
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,140
Last time we had dinner,

230
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,340
you mentioned you had

231
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,980
some thoughts.

232
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,820
What were they?

233
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,860
Tell me.

234
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,740
Momo doesn't feel well today.

235
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:11,900
Let her rest.

236
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:12,940
We can talk another time.

237
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,780
Go back to your room.

238
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,140
She's not feeling well?

239
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,860
- Did she eat...
- No,

240
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,540
it's just stress. She's been

241
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,420
really anxious.

242
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,780
Let her relax for now.

243
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,180
Do you know

244
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,940
why we named you Chen Mo?

245
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,740
"If you don't erupt in silence,

246
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,540
you'll perish in silence?"

247
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,980
That was just a joke from your dad.

248
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,060
Your dad came from

249
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,140
a bad background.

250
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,820
He worked hard to get

251
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,060
where he is now.

252
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,060
When you were little,
he would always say,

253
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,540
"Our child, Chen Mo,

254
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,740
doesn't need to worry about being last,

255
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,580
as long as she keeps
moving forward with courage."

256
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,820
So,

257
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,420
don't worry.

258
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,140
Just be yourself and

259
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:10,980
keep moving forward.

260
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,340
Your dad and I

261
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,860
will always be by your side.

262
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,580
As for Xiao Han,

263
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,060
I think

264
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,460
you should have a good talk with him.

265
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,260
Why did you call me so urgently?

266
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:43,900
Is it

267
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,820
about that thing?

268
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,100
I told you,

269
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,940
it's really not a big deal.

270
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,580
Don't let it bother you.

271
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,580
Xiao Han,

272
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,620
I need to tell you something.

273
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:07,980
What is it?

274
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,780
I should have told you earlier,

275
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,740
but…

276
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,260
Anyway, it's my fault.

277
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,260
What's going on?

278
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,460
Why so serious?

279
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,060
I want to apply to
a university in Beijing.

280
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,100
Bei…

281
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,220
Beijing?

282
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,420
Not SUIBE?

283
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,820
That was my dad's choice,

284
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,940
not mine.

285
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,500
I know

286
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,380
it sounds abrupt,

287
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,660
but this

288
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,620
has been on my mind for a long time.

289
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,380
With the application deadline

290
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,940
coming up, I feel like

291
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,780
I can't avoid it any longer.

292
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,620
I've always wanted to go to Beijing.

293
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,500
But you know that I've always wanted to

294
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,900
go to Jiao Tong University, right?

295
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,220
Yes.

296
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:02,940
Actually, the reason

297
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,740
I called you that day
was to tell you this.

298
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,220
Which day?

299
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,020
That day on the rooftop.

300
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,300
But…

301
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,860
I didn't expect

302
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,060
what happened that day…

303
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,380
So you were too embarrassed to let me know,

304
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,780
because I lost the "City Model Student" title

305
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,700
and those 20 points.

306
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,140
That's not what I meant!

307
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,860
I don't want to lie to myself,

308
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,580
and I don't want to lie to you either!

309
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,740
You've always wanted to go to Jiao Tong,

310
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,020
and I've always had my own thoughts.

311
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,300
I get it now.

312
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,740
I wish you success.

313
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,180
Beijing?

314
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,420
Seriously?

315
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,740
He just gave up 20 points

316
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,380
for revealing their relationship,

317
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,660
and now she wants to go to Beijing?

318
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:12,980
It's...

319
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,060
A little bit too much, don't you think?

320
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,940
You're being unfair.

321
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,220
Chen Mo has every right
to choose what she wants.

322
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,180
No,

323
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,140
it's just that Xiao Han is set on

324
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,300
Jiao Tong,

325
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,980
and we all knew that.

326
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,460
That means he'll stay in Shanghai.

327
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,220
Four years of university!

328
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,460
Four years apart...

329
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,980
One in Shanghai,

330
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,980
the other in Beijing…

331
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,060
It's a long-distance relationship.

332
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,380
Long-distance?

333
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,820
So what?

334
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,940
What do you mean?

335
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,660
Long-distance relationships
have a lot of uncertainties.

336
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,660
Who knows what could happen?

337
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,660
In this world,

338
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,980
everything

339
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,540
changes.

340
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,420
Even if two people

341
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,780
are in the same city

342
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,260
or the same school,

343
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,700
things can still change.

344
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:01,980
If you love someone,

345
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,100
shouldn't you let them

346
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,660
pursue what they love,

347
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,540
instead of forcing them

348
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,140
to make sacrifices?

349
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,100
I... Am I wrong?

350
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,260
Chen Mo.

351
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,380
Chen Mo.

352
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,260
Are you okay?

353
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,740
I expected this.

354
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,700
What did he say?

355
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,460
He said…

356
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,140
"I wish you success."

357
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,380
Did you explain to him

358
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,780
why you want to leave Shanghai

359
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,580
and go to Beijing?

360
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,420
I didn't have the chance.

361
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,580
Honestly,

362
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,260
I don't think he even wants to hear it.

363
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,780
Han,

364
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,460
eat some more vegetables.

365
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,300
Here,

366
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,660
you can try some tomato and egg rice.

367
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,020
I'm full.

368
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,380
You guys eat.

369
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,420
He hasn't eaten much.

370
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,220
What's going on?

371
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,380
Nothing.

372
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,220
Mao Tou,

373
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,780
what's wrong with him?

374
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:29,940
(2002 General College Admissions
Candidate Application Form 1)

375
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,700
(Business Administration; Finance;
International Trade)

376
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,020
(Law; Economics)
Finance is great!

377
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,620
Your uncle recommended it,

378
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,380
saying there's a "Warm Street" in the U.S.,

379
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,420
where people work in finance

380
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,700
and make a lot of money!

381
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,220
Think it through carefully.

382
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,980
The neighbor, Wang, said

383
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,300
law is a good choice.

384
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,460
Become a lawyer

385
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,020
and get paid by the second.

386
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,020
Listen to me on this.

387
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,660
Management is really the best,
the most in-demand!

388
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,860
All kinds of companies need
management talent.

389
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,980
After graduation,
you can work for my company.

390
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,830
How high is the sky,

391
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,550
and how vast is the world?

392
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,990
You have to see it for yourself.

393
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,110
As long as a small flower

394
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,560
or grass grows in this world,

395
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,200
it will surely feel

396
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,760
the light of the moon.

397
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,500
Jiayue,

398
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,140
what is it that
you can't say over the phone?

399
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:15,980
Brother Xiao Han,

400
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,900
I have a message for you.

401
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,220
I've decided.

402
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,100
I'll apply to the Chinese major at ECNU.

403
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,900
East China Normal University?

404
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,780
That's great.

405
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,060
I know

406
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,220
the Chinese Department won't
turn me into a writer,

407
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,260
and I probably won't make a lot of money

408
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,820
like in law or business.

409
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,340
And

410
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,940
I'm not sure

411
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,460
I'll even get in.

412
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,980
But I don't care anymore.

413
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,820
I want to give it a shot.

414
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,380
Four years in college,

415
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,580
we should choose a major that we truly love,

416
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,620
and feel excited

417
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,100
and passionate about.

418
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,660
You think so too?

419
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,100
Of course.

420
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,100
College is a one-time experience,

421
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,260
and so is youth.

422
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,580
The future is still far off,

423
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,260
and things like work and money

424
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,580
are for later.

425
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,380
That sounds a lot like what she said.

426
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,660
She?

427
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,740
Actually, this decision

428
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,700
was also inspired by Chen Mo.

429
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,380
She said

430
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,260
she wants to go to Beijing

431
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,140
because she wants to see

432
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,940
what kind of person she'll become

433
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,380
once she leaves Shanghai.

434
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,580
How high is the sky,

435
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,980
and how vast is the world?

436
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,340
You have to see it for yourself.

437
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,660
What kind of adult

438
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,580
will I become

439
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,620
in ten or twenty years?

440
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,780
Whether I'll be happy

441
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,700
or not,

442
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,300
regretful or not,

443
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,580
it doesn't matter.

444
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,260
Anyway,

445
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,820
I've lived here for eighteen years,

446
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,300
and I want to see how wonderful

447
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,860
the outside world is.

448
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,300
Brother Xiao Han,

449
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,260
look at this.

450
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,100
Remember

451
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,180
when we were kids?

452
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,060
I used to

453
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,900
think Puyang New Village

454
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,860
was huge.

455
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,260
I thought going to No. 2 Middle School

456
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,260
with you was the proudest thing

457
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,660
of my life.

458
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,820
But later, I realized

459
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,900
that Puyang New Village isn't so big.

460
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,900
It's not even the center of Shanghai,

461
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,980
nor the center of Putuo District.

462
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,220
Shanghai is a part of China,

463
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,620
and the world is beyond China…

464
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,220
Now, I'm inspired by Chen Mo,

465
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,660
and I want to see the world outside.

466
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,300
Brother Xiao Han,

467
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:03,980
what do you think?

468
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,420
(2002 General College Admissions
Candidate Application Form 1)

469
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,620
Come in.

470
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,020
Han,

471
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,540
I've warmed up your milk.

472
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,420
Han,

473
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,180
I want to talk to you

474
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,980
about your college application.

475
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:49,860
Han,

476
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,260
I've been

477
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,140
thinking a lot these days.

478
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,620
Have you ever considered that

479
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,940
when your dad told you

480
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,580
about Fudan and Jiao Tong,

481
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,460
he was just speaking offhand?

482
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,260
He didn't expect

483
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,300
his son

484
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,860
to be this outstanding,

485
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,780
to have so many choices

486
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,220
like

487
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,780
Tsinghua, Peking University,

488
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,380
Nanjing University,
or Zhejiang University.

489
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,100
Han,

490
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,780
have you ever

491
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,020
thought about other options,

492
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,820
even for a moment?

493
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,540
Have you?

494
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,820
So,

495
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,740
your decision

496
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,780
shouldn't be based on
the promise to your dad.

497
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,900
The most important thing

498
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,540
is what you want.

499
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,820
What do you really want?

500
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,500
Han,

501
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,740
since your father passed away,

502
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,940
you've been so well-behaved,

503
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,140
so understanding,

504
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,460
never rebellious,

505
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,820
and never making me worry.

506
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,820
I feel really sorry for you.

507
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,380
Sometimes, I also feel guilty.

508
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,580
I even blame your dad.

509
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,180
Why did he leave the two of us

510
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,220
to save those two machines?

511
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,740
What was his intention?

512
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,780
What was he thinking?

513
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,780
But over time,

514
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,460
I started to understand.

515
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,180
Maybe back then,
he didn't think about anything.

516
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,860
He didn't think about being a hero,

517
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,420
or whether

518
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,020
it was worth it.

519
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,340
He just felt that

520
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,740
he needed to do it,

521
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,820
and so he did.

522
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,540
He didn't think much.

523
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,100
Han,

524
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,020
as his son,

525
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,540
I hope you

526
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,220
listen to your own heart.

527
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,020
Don't consider anyone else's thoughts.

528
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,740
Don't think about Dad, me,

529
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,820
or Chen Mo.

530
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,420
Don't worry about promises.

531
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,580
Just do what you want.

532
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,660
For once,

533
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,500
I want you to be selfish

534
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,100
and follow your heart.

535
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,460
Come out.

536
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,220
Momo,

537
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,420
take a look for yourself.

538
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,860
These are the universities

539
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,340
you have a chance of getting into.

540
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,140
They're all in Beijing!

541
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,980
Your dad agreed.

542
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,460
Soldier,

543
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,980
you didn't keep your promise.

544
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,540
You didn't wait for me.

545
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,340
I didn't know you were coming.

546
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:41,260
Then where are you going now?

547
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,420
Look at you, with such a serious face!

548
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,940
The child in my arms

549
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,540
is going to be frightened by you!

550
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:52,580
(Directing Department Third Exam Venue)

551
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,100
Now, I have a

552
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,940
question related to dubbing films.

553
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,300
Oh, my dear examiner!

554
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,140
I'm all ears!

555
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,580
Alright,

556
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,540
please talk about

557
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,580
the issues

558
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,700
in dubbing films.

559
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:16,660
Issue! I... Issues...

560
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,860
Such as

561
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,220
language habits,

562
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,500
voice expressions,

563
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,740
and so on.

564
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,380
Do you

565
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,620
think there are any problems?

566
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,260
No problems...

567
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,860
No... no... no.

568
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,540
Well... yes, there are some problems...

569
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:42,460
Bang... Bang...

570
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,740
Turn... Stop…

571
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,780
Oh,

572
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:47,940
Pei!

573
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,260
My sweetheart!

574
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:52,380
Every step you take, it's like
you're stepping on my heart,

575
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,740
making it tremble.

576
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,660
Turn... Stop...

577
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,820
Oh,

578
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,820
Liu Songming!

579
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,300
My honey!

580
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,220
In that case,

581
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:06,260
you should go see a cardiologist.

582
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,260
I...

583
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,620
I think...

584
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,620
the... tone...

585
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,460
definitely exists...

586
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,540
I think this...

587
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,460
this tone...

588
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,740
the design of it... it's...

589
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,220
Qing,

590
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,740
right now, it's not Mom being paranoid.

591
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,940
It's you who's being paranoid!

592
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,980
Your tone of voice

593
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,340
is like a ghost is possessing you.

594
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,700
Mom and Dad are really worried about you.

595
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,180
Dubbing films

596
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,740
sometimes have a...

597
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,380
somewhat eerie tone.

598
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,700
When actors perform,

599
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,660
they... they... "Oh!"

600
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,660
Suddenly, it's as if

601
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,380
they've been possessed,

602
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:55,020
which makes the audience

603
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,700
feel uneasy.

604
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,100
Of course,

605
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,660
there are excellent voice actors,

606
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,420
like Mr. Qiao Zhen

607
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,900
and Ms. Ding Jianhua,

608
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,740
whose voices are very captivating.

609
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,780
But as times change,

610
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,980
maybe there should be

611
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,380
more room for experimentation in dubbing,

612
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,660
or perhaps a different way of performing?

613
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,780
Cheers!

614
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,740
Congratulations to the big star!

615
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,220
Congratulations to the big director!

616
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,100
And to the big director's mom!

617
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,860
Thank you! Thank you!

618
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,460
You have no idea

619
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,660
how scared I was at that moment!

620
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,900
The examiner asked

621
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,380
a question that completely threw me off!

622
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,460
Luckily, I had a stroke of inspiration

623
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,420
and thought of my amazing mom and dad.

624
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,100
She thought of me!

625
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,860
Thanks to my mom and dad!

626
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,260
Qing! Mom's pride!

627
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,180
You're amazing!

628
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,780
Alright, stop standing.

629
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,860
Everyone, sit down and chat.

630
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,700
Auntie Pei,

631
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,740
can I have another bottle?

632
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,940
Sure. Make yourself at home.

633
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:57,780
Okay, okay.

634
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,940
I also have Cola Cao here.

635
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,140
Really?

636
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,540
Chang Wuji,

637
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,180
you shouldn't be sitting

638
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,220
with us here.

639
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,460
You should be sitting
with them over there!

640
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,860
You've already secured a spot,

641
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,780
but we're still preparing for the exam.

642
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,500
Chang Wuji, I'm telling you,

643
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,780
there's a line here. You get it?

644
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,860
People sitting on this side
still have to take the exam.

645
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,300
You sitting here will affect our studies.

646
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,700
Go sit over there.

647
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,300
Chang Wuji, don't mind them.

648
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,580
They're just joking.

649
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,020
Just kidding with you.

650
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,540
Genius,

651
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,900
you can sit with me too.

652
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,540
I don't have to take the exam!

653
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,500
Pretty cool, right?

654
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:32,780
Auntie Pei,

655
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,700
I'm hungry.

656
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,340
- So hungry.
- He promised me he'd come.

657
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,500
Ms. Huang,

658
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,500
please be quicker.

659
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,660
The kids are starving.

660
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,380
It's almost ready.

661
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,580
Thanks, Auntie Huang!

662
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,100
Give him extra. Stuff him full.

663
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:45,940
Brother Xiao Han!

664
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,860
Bring another chair.

665
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,260
- You came so late?
- Come join us.

666
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,100
You guys chat first.

668
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:52,940
I need to talk to you.

669
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,780
Come out for a second.

670
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,780
I thought you weren't going to come.

671
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,700
What if I didn't come?

672
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,340
Then I'd go to find you.

673
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:32,860
I have something for you.

674
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,700
Me too!

675
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,220
Let me go first.

What...

678
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,140
does this mean?

679
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,780
Momo,

680
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,060
take a look for yourself.

681
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,860
These are the universities

682
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,260
you have a chance of getting into.

00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,740
They're all in Beijing!

00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,780
I went to Xinjiang when I was sixteen.

687
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,340
You're already eighteen now.

688
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,220
Want to venture out?

689
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,540
Good,

690
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,580
we support you.

691
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,220
But do remember

692
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,140
that you must follow through.

693
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,220
Don't come crying back halfway,

694
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,260
looking for us.

695
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,980
Don't worry. That won't happen!

696
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,940
Your dad is just acting tough.

697
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,260
In reality,

698
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,820
he's the one who'll miss you the most.

699
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,820
Go.

700
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,260
Chen,

701
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,300
when you were in Xinjiang,

702
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,100
we couldn't even make phone calls,

703
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,860
and we had to rely on letters
to keep in touch.

704
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,420
Why are you bringing that up?

705
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,460
Things aren't the same now.

706
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,180
Fine, fine. Things are different now.

707
00:34:59,060 --> 00:34:59,900
Momo,

708
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,340
Shanghai to Xinjiang is
over 4,000 kilometers,

709
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,660
and it took four days and nights by train.

710
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:05,900
But now,

711
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,660
Shanghai to Beijing is much closer.

712
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,780
A single train ticket
can fix everything,

713
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,820
right?

714
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:13,860
I promise,

715
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,180
for the next four years,

716
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,500

26 weeks in total.

721
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,260

724
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,580
Is it wrong?

725
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,660
Aren't you back for the Spring Festival

726

for next semester.

730
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,380
This address is wrong too.

731
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,580
No way! I've checked it.

and I still haven't decided on a major.

But

744
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,740

00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,460
Actually, there's something

765
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,580
only you can help me with.

766
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,420
Only me?

767
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,180
What is it?

768
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,540
Make up for my last regret

769
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,900
in high school.

your only regret in high school

775
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,060
is that we didn't meet!

776
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,630
(Reed)
After the Gaokao,

777
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:40,830
can we meet?

778
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:42,910
It'll be our fifth attempt.

779
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:43,990
We'll meet this time!

780
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,200

786
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,150
I really need to thank you in person.

787
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,110
A beam of light...

788
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:16,550
I shine.

789
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:18,630
Then I fade.

790
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:20,310
I shine again.

791
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,060

792
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,780
