=Episode 24=

24
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:40,680
Han?

25
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,130
Surname Han?

26
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,940
I don't think Qing has mentioned

27
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,210
a classmate whose surname is Han.

28
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:55,600
My baby hasn't mentioned it either.

29
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,720
Right?

30
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,050
Well,

31
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,240
could he be from another class?

32
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,800
I don't think so.

33
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,210
The three of them are always together

34
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,600
from school to home.

35
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,090
How could they meet other guys?

36
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,860
As for the boys
they often hang out with,

37
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,260
they're

38
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,420
Wang Bin,

39
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,420
Liu Jianfeng,

40
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,100
Chang Wuji,

41
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,420
Xiao Han,

42
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,300
and Lu Yao.

43
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,260
We know them all.

44
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,030
- Xiao Han!
- Xiao Han!

45
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,580
Xiao Han?

46
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,380
Tonight, our stargazing spot

47
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,580
will be by the riverside.

48
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,900
The direction will be southeast.

49
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,580
Brother Xiao Han.

50
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,220
Jiayue.

51
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,540
Are you holding the stargazing info?

52
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:42,860
Yes.

53
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,420
Tonight, we will stargaze there.

54
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,660
Are you coming?

55
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,020
Of course.

56
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,700
If you're free,

57
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,100
let's do it together.

58
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:52,940
Sure.

59
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,660
Okay.

60
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,740
They're still waiting for us. Let's go.

61
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,100
Okay, bye.

62
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,220
Fangfang.

63
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,860
Why are you here?

64
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,540
That's impossible.

65
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,560
Absolutely impossible.

66
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,300
Well, everything is possible.

67
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,820
But I know Han well.

68
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,700
I raised him by myself.

69
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,860
I know what kind of child he is.

70
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,260
He wouldn't date early.

71
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,460
In the past,

72
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,540
some girls showed interest in him,

73
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,020
but he handled it well.

74
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,020
He indeed handled it well.

75
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,140
Since Aiping says so,

76
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,860
perhaps

77
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,980
I misunderstood.

78
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,490
Yes, it might be a misunderstanding.

79
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,700
Fangfang,

80
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,020
don't worry too much.

81
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,740
I think we should

82
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,900
trust our children.

83
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,700
Look!

84
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,820
Another paper airplane!

85
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,580
Another paper airplane?

86
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,820
Where did you get it?

87
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,820
From Xiao Han's room.

88
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,140
You went through his stuff again?

89
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,980
Look at you.

90
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,820
I was just worried.

91
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,340
Besides,

92
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,820
I'm good at

93
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,380
doing this.

94
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,500
Well, in Momo's room,

95
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,260
there's also a model airplane

96
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,820
she prepared for Xiao Han.

97
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,420
That's right.

98
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,940
Look, they both have model airplanes.

99
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,180
What does this say?

100
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,300
Loner Xiao?

101
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:35,900
Xiao Han.

102
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,180
Loner...

103
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,020
That's Xiao Han.

104
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,180
Look, it says

105
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,540
sorry.

106
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,300
Is it an apology?

107
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,060
Who's apologizing to whom?

108
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,140
They're already
apologizing for something.

109
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,180
I think,

110
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,060
we should ask

111
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,140
these kids

112
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,820
after they come back,

113
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,260
and we'll know

114
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,100
the truth.

115
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,230
- Don't just guess.
- Xiu'e,

116
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,940
let's check Xiao Han's room.

117
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,180
I just checked it.

118
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,800
Fangfang,

119
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,860
come with us.

120
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,800
- Let's go.
- Could it be...?

121
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,860
Let's figure it out.

122
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,300
Come on. Hurry up.

123
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,860
What's up there?

124
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,820
What's up there?

125
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,020
Don't know. Xiao Han is tall.

126
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,260
What is this?

127
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,460
What?

128
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,420
Late Night Temptation.

129
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,420
The Golden Lotus...

130
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,420
So many!

131
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,180
So many. It takes time

132
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,500
to collect all of them.

133
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,620
That's impossible.

134
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,180
Han doesn't look like that.

135
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,620
Mao Tou might do that.

136
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,700
But Xiao Han...

137
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,260
Fangfang.

138
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,140
Don't worry.

139
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,820
Once they come back,

140
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,820
I'll ask Xiao Han

141
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,300
and give you an explanation.

142
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,300
(To Loner Xiao, Sorry)

143
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,140
You're back.

144
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,580
Where's Chen Mo?

145
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,380
Where is she? Hasn't she come back?

146
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,820
She's gone to

147
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,060
a fishing village for research

148
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,380
for three days.

149
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,780
Her school sent a notice

150
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,060
to parents a month ago.

151
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,820
I must have forgotten.

152
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,180
When she left this morning,

153
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,620
why didn't you remind me?

154
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,020
She left yesterday.

155
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,620
She wasn't home all night.

156
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,620
Didn't you know?

157
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,420
She always comes home

158
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,740
and hides in her room.

159
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,260
It's normal not to notice.

160
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,220
How often

161
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,580
does she talk to us?

162
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,500
Listen, maybe our daughter

163
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,340
has kept many things

164
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,260
from us.

165
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,940
You have no idea.

166
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,620
Fangfang and Aiping

167
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,740
were stunned.

168
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,820
They sat there silent for so long.

169
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,500
They didn't know
their children's thoughts.

170
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,260
Chen Mo and Xiao Han...

171
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,580
We never expected this.

172
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,620
But at this point,

173
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,700
they're at the age

174
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,060
of having a crush on someone.

175
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,660
So...

176
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,580
So what?

177
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,300
Haven't you discovered

178
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,820
our baby's thoughts?

179
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,890
What's wrong with her?

180
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,900
I need to do something.

181
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,980
I'll give her a little heads-up.

182
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,740
I'm ready.

183
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,020
Let's go.

184
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,860
I'm not going.

185
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,020
I just remembered

186
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,140
I promised Wang Bin

187
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,260
to draw their portraits.

188
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,540
You go ahead.

189
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,220
Ka Men, what about you?

190
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,260
I suddenly feel tired.

191
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,140
Guess I'll lie down.

192
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:05,740
I'm not going either.

193
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,740
You're not going either?

194
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,780
Then I'll be going alone.

195
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,020
It's okay.

196
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,640
Haven't you been looking forward to it?

197
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,740
Go ahead.

198
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,100
I'm going.

199
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:23,890
I'll make a wish for you.

200
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,020
Qian Jiayue,
Mr. Zhou is looking for you.

201
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,980
He said there was
an urgent call from home.

202
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,020
You must take it.

203
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,380
Village entrance.

204
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,820
- Okay.
- Go.

205
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,860
Come back quickly.

206
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,310
- We'll wait by the lake.
- Okay.

207
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,820
Hello.

208
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,740
Hi, baby.

209
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,980
It's me.

210
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,220
Baby,

211
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,140
how are you?

212
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,860
I'm doing fine.

213
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,300
What's wrong?

214
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,020
I just want

215
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,860
to tell you

216
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,220
no matter what happens,

217
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,260
you must stay strong.

218
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,100
Got it?

219
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,140
In this world, Baby,

220
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,860
you can overcome

221
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,380
everything.

222
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,620
Your health is the priority.

223
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,100
No matter how

224
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,660
upset you are,

225
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,620
you must

226
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,780
eat and sleep well.

227
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,750
Right?

228
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,620
In that case,

229
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,020
you'll be strong again when it's over.

230
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:40,860
Mom,

231
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,020
did something happen to you?

232
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,020
Is Granny alright?

233
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,860
Did Dad hurt his back again?

234
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,980
I'm fine.

235
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,460
Baby, Granny is here too.

236
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,900
I'm fine.

237
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,380
I don't know what's wrong
with your mom.

238
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,460
Hello, Baby,

239
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,900
you must keep in mind

240
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,500
what I'm telling you.

241
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,500
There's no big deal.

242
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,100
Don't take it seriously.

243
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,540
Eat and sleep well.

244
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,500
Got it?

245
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,020
(Reception Room)

246
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,140
I got it.

247
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,260
If nothing else,

248
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,340
I'll hang up.

249
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,460
Okay, okay.

250
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,340
Goodbye.

251
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,020
What's happening?

252
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,860
She's out of her mind.

253
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,380
Ridiculous.

254
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,100
You're making it

255
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,020
such a big deal.

256
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,220
Why would she

257
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,060
be upset?

258
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,740
It scares me to death.

259
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,540
No, it's just a heads-up.

260
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,500
Always be prepared.

261
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,620
What am I supposed to do?

262
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,340
- But next time,
- What should I do?

263
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,380
don't be so serious, okay?

264
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,620
Just relax.

265
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,380
I remembered.

266
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,460
I need to go to the market.

267
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:53,900
Where are you going?

268
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,460
Market.

269
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,600
To buy tomatoes.

270
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,500
Mom, it's evening.

271
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,140
Buy what? The market is closed.

272
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,650
Who goes grocery shopping at this hour?

273
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,620
That's right.

274
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,060
It's evening.

275
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,500
I was confused.

276
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,220
You can't be so serious over the phone.

277
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,740
She thought something happened.

278
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,860
You freaked her out.

279
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,020
It's raining outside.

280
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,620
- Qian Jiayue!
- Class leader!

281
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,860
Why are you back?

282
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,780
Let's go inside!

283
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:22,490
It's raining heavily.

284
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,370
The event is canceled.

285
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,620
Let's go.

286
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,140
Hurry up.

287
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,620
Why is it raining so heavily?

288
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,100
- No idea!
- Come on.

289
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,820
- Dry yourself off.
- You're back.

290
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,860
I'm back.

291
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,700
Where's Chen Mo?

292
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,220
Chen Mo?

293
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,500
I have no idea.

294
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,040
She saw it was raining,

295
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,740
so she went to bring you an umbrella.

296
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:41,780
Didn't you see her?

297
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,740
No, I didn't.

298
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,160
I answered a call

299
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,660
at the village entrance and came back.

300
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,500
I didn't go to the Stargazing Station.

301
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,460
Your clothes are soaked.

302
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,460
You should get changed.

303
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,460
Okay.

304
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,020
Where is Qian Jiayue?

305
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,580
She didn't come.

306
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,900
I don't know
how long this rain will last.

307
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,500
Take this umbrella.

308
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,340
Take it.

309
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:32,980
Chen Mo!

310
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,140
It's been so long.

311
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,380
Can we talk?

312
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,040
There's nothing to talk about.

313
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,260
What do you mean?

314
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,580
In that case,

315
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,100
let's clear things up today.

316
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,620
I'm sure you know

317
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,860
how I feel.

318
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,740
As for how you feel,

319
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,020
I thought I knew,

320
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,380
but now I'm confused.

321
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,220
After my birthday,

322
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,980
you suddenly changed.

323
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,740
You started to hate me.

324
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,460
You've been avoiding me.

325
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,260
Chen Mo, I don't want anything from you.

326
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,380
But there's no need for us

327
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,500
to end up like this.

328
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,540
- Many things...
- Xiao Han!

329
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,620
Qian Jiayue is my good friend.

330
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,140
So what?

331
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:32,980
Is that why...?

332
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,660
So, you don't hate me,

333
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,620
and you haven't changed.

334
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,460
I didn't

335
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,740
get you wrong, right?

336
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,340
Yes.

337
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,900
You didn't.

338
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,860
I haven't changed.

339
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,140
I don't hate you.

340
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,620
But so what?

341
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,260
Look, guys.

342
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,860
The rain is about to stop.

343
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,380
I wonder if we can see a shooting star.

344
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,380
It's almost lights-out time.

345
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,740
Why isn't Chen Mo back yet?

346
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,340
That's right.

347
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,380
See?

348
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,740
It was just a drizzle.

349
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,580
A shooting star!

350
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,820
Where?

351
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,180
There.

352
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,100
There really is!

353
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,740
So beautiful.

354
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,520
I want to make a wish.

355
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,620
Will there be more?

356
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,380
Yes.

357
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,380
Look.

358
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,500
The stars came out
after the rain stopped.

359
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,740
You're a Sagittarius, right?

360
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,300
Look.

361
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,940
(Centaurus)
The Sagittarius

362
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,260
is also called Centaurus.

363
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,940
Can we find it in the sky?

364
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,180
Is it that one?

365
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,180
No.

366
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,500
That's the Big Dipper.

367
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,500
What about those three?

368
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,420
To the left.

369
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:03,940
To the left?

370
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,300
There, look.

371
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,180
Follow my sight.

372
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,300
- That one?
- Over there.

373
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,780
See that?

00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,020
Shooting stars are beautiful,

386
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,460
but they pass so quickly.

387
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,540
The shooting stars are gone,

388
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,260
but there are still many stars.

389
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,060
Do you know?

390
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,100
The stars we see now

391
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,100
are the images from long ago.

392
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,660
They traveled for many light years

393
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,220
to arrive here.

394
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,340
So, they've always been there.

395
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,620
Yes.

396
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,500
It's like Qian Jiayue.

397
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,020
Actually, in Grade 10,

398
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,220
I talked to her once.

399
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,460
Perhaps I wasn't direct enough

400
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,820
because I didn't want to hurt her.

401
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,180
Later, she...

402
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,740
Should I tell her again?

403
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,780
You'll still hurt her feelings.

404
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,100
Thank you.

405
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,020
I'm going back.

406
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,900
(Fishing Safety First)

407
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,740
Chen Mo.

408
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,020
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

409
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,740
Wait a moment. I'll be quick.

410
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,200
Last night, Qian Jiayue and I
were looking for you.

411
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,370
You and Xiao Han...

412
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,820
She saw it.

413
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:40,020
(Shanghai Puyang No. 2 Middle School)

414
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,180
We're here.

415
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,620
Jiayue!

416
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,740
I need to talk to you.

417
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,180
Chen Mo!

418
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,020
Xiao Han!

419
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,740
Mom?

420
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,500
Explain this.

421
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:19,900
What is this?

422
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,020
Did you go through my stuff?

423
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,540
This isn't mine.

424
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,020
Not yours?

425
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,540
I found it

426
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,380
under your bed.

427
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,580
You hid it so well.

428
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,660
It's my classmate's.

429
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,700
I thought about this all night.

430
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,500
I know it's normal

431
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,780
to have some feelings

432
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,980
at your age.

433
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,100
But...

434
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,340
But what?

435
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,500
What about this?

436
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,020
Is this yours?

437
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,020
Then this is mine.

438
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,020
This...

439
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,420
It's...

440
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,700
Is it true?

441
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,660
You're a girl.

442
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,460
You must learn to protect yourself.

443
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,620
You need

444
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,580
to have boundaries.

445
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,260
You must love yourself.

446
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,500
What boundaries?

447
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,340
Love myself?

448
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,020
What is this?

449
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,500
How did you get this?

450
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:29,780
Han,

451
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,700
I've always trusted you.

452
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,260
When did you change?

453
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,340
Change into what?

454
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,460
It's not what you think.

455
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,580
Then what is it? Tell me!

456
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,260
What's going on with you and Chen Mo?

457
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,540
When did you start it?

458
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,820
How far have you gone?

459
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,220
I... We...

460
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,820
What are you talking about?

461
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,820
What happened to you?

462
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,340
Did you do anything inappropriate?

463
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,200
No.

464
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,100
We didn't do anything wrong.
Absolutely not!

465
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:50,940
Then what is this?

466
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,260
Why do you have this?

467
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,780
Why did he apologize to you?

468
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,220
Explain this to me!

469
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,260
He apologized because last time...

470
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,100
Because of what?

471
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,020
What are these things?

472
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,260
- Tell me!
- I told you this isn't mine.

473
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,540
Why don't you believe me?

474
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,580
Xiao Han!

475
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,100
Get out!

476
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,580
I don't want to talk!

477
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,220
Do you know how worried I am?

478
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,940
I'm your mom. Who else should I ask?

479
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:14,810
Should I ask Dad?

480
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,020
Should I ask him to scold you?

481
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,820
Fine, tell Dad!

482
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,220
Ask him to scold me!

483
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,140
Go!

484
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,580
Chen Mo!

485
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,060
Chen Mo!

486
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,220
(Our Story)

487
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:59,820
(My friends, why don't you talk to me?)

488
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,860
(Stargazing: I watch the stars,
and they look back at me.)

489
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:09,020
(I wink at the stars,
and they twinkle back with a smile.)

490
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,260
(See You in College)

491
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,780
In three years, we'll take the Gaokao

492
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,020
and go to college.

493
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,020
That's the priority right now.

494
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,100
So,

495
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,260
let's focus on studies.

496
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,820
What do you think?

497
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:41,820
(See you in college)

498
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,420
I'm coming in.

499
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,820
Baby,

500
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,700
I've prepared cold medicine.

501
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,180
Drink it while it's hot.

502
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,340
Good girl.

503
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,140
Baby,

504
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,180
didn't you bring an umbrella?

505
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,820
How did you get caught in the rain?

506
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,500
Did you...?

507
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,340
Mom.

508
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,500
You should

509
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,660
take a break tomorrow.

510
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,980
I'll talk to Mr. Zhou.

511
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,840
You'll take a day off.

512
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,380
Alright, alright.

513
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,700
Take the cold medicine

514
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,300
and get some rest.

515
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,580
Sleep early.

516
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,500
Well,

517
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,660
I'll head back to class.

518
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,460
Those two small figures

519
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,780
look so good.

520
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,250
I didn't know

521
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,020
you kept the paper airplane.

522
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,500
Well,

523
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,900
you didn't throw away

524
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,020
that "Sorry" either.

525
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,460
Yesterday, my mom kept asking me

526
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,700
why you wrote "Sorry".

527
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,340
Did your dad give you a hard time?

528
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,980
I thought he would punish me,

529
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,500
but nothing happened.

530
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,180
It was quite unusual.

531
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,380
What about you?

532
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,020
It's complicated.

533
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,780
There's something else.

534
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,820
My mom misunderstood.

535
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:03,900
What is it?

536
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,540
Nothing.

537
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,260
I can explain it.

538
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,540
Don't worry about me.

539
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,100
But

540
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,100
Jiayue...

541
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,900
I'm a bit worried about her.

542
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,340
When I see her,

543
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:24,780
I'll try

544
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,580
to talk to her.

545
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,140
(Class 5, Grade 10)

546
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,580
So, let's compare 2A.

547
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,060
Then 10

548
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,780
minus YP, that's

549
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,700
16/5.

550
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,220
- Ka Men.
- 2 times 5 is 10,

551
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,740
and then 50/5.

552
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,580
Where

553
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,500
is she?

554
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,460
She took a sick leave.

555
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,700
34/5.

556
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,980
Yes, 34/5.

557
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,180
So, remember...

558
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,220
She didn't tell me either.

559
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:58,340
This point...

560
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,100
Mr. Zhou told me about it.

561
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,140
What is this point?

562
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,060
PF.

563
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,700
Most importantly, remember "P".

564
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,980
And "F"

565
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,060
is perpendicular to...

566
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,300
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

567
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,500
Chen Mo, we're leaving, bye.

568
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,420
We agreed on the compensation,

569
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,020
and I covered the medical fees.

570
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,700
Why are they asking for more now?

571
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,060
I'm busy at the moment.

572
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,580
Talk to you later.

573
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:40,900
Alright, goodbye.

574
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,500
Coming.

575
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,260
Mrs. Qian.

576
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,020
Xiao Han.

577
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,500
Well,

578
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,980
I want to talk to...

579
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,820
Jiayue?

580
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,260
Xiao Han,

581
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,780
she already knows

582
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,500
what you want to say.

583
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:28,820
So...

584
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,340
- She...
- She is fine.

585
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,020
Well, maybe you should go back.

586
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,620
Okay, okay.

587
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,500
Sure, no problem.

588
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,300
Within these two days, okay?

589
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:02,940
Han.

590
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:03,860
Uncle Jia.

591
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,100
My neighbor.

592
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,620
Okay, okay.

593
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,060
Coming.

594
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,540
Chen Mo.

595
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,620
I want to talk to

596
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,020
Qian Jiayue.

597
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,420
Are you feeling better?

598
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,620
Just tell me directly.

599
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,540
I want to explain it.

600
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:43,980
Xiao Han and I...

601
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:49,250
At first, I really didn't know

602
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,660
you liked him.

603
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,060
After I found out,

604
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,980
I tried hard to avoid him.

605
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,140
I really value

606
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,140
our friendship.

607
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,620
The meteor shower...

608
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,100
It was really a coincidence.

609
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,140
I didn't expect to meet him.

610
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,420
Neither of us expected it.

611
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,020
I'm really confused right now.

612
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,460
Qian Jiayue.

613
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,060
I know

614
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,180
you're upset

615
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,220
and uncomfortable.

616
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,700
Don't hold it back.

617
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,860
Speak up.

618
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,140
Just yell at me.

619
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,020
Take it out on me.

620
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,380
Just do anything

621
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,540
that makes you feel better.

622
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,020
Yell at you?

623
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,540
Will it make me feel better

624
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,460
or ease your conscience?

625
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:44,860
Chen Mo.

626
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,500
You didn't do anything wrong.

627
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,300
I wish I could say,

628
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,860
"It's okay.

629
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,060
I'm not uncomfortable at all."

630
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,860
But sorry,

631
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,380
I just can't.

632
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,020
I really can't

633
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,540
just ignore all this.

634
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:11,860
I can't act like

635
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,500
nothing happened either.

636
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:19,900
Just go back.

637
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,300
Qian Jiayue.

638
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,380
Are we still friends?

639
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,820
Are we still friends?

640
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,500
I don't know.

641
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,220
Do I have to say yes?

642
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,300
This is the bag

643
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,940
I asked Mao Tou about.

644
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,700
Little Imp told me

645
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,900
Wang Bin asked him to keep it.

646
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,140
Han wasn't lying.

647
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,580
Look, this is the Japanese character

648
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,500
"of".

649
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,220
I'm sorry.

650
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,260
Misunderstanding.

651
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,540
I'm so sorry.

652
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,370
Little Imp, get rid of this,

653
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:54,620
or I'll report it to the police.

654
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,180
Throw it away now!

655
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,260
Han,

656
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,820
I blamed you

657
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,300
without knowing the facts.

658
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,500
It was my fault.

659
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,380
It's okay.

660
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:33,660
But

661
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,140
you and Chen Mo...

662
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,660
Again?

663
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,660
About this, here's my

664
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:39,820
opinion.

665
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,520
- I'll go to study.
- I think...

666
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,420
I think studying is important.

667
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,340
Qing is back?

668
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,540
Can you ask her

669
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,580
if she knows where Momo is?

670
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,140
Pei, I have to hang up.

671
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:58,980
Talk to you later.

672
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,140
You're back.

673
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,100
I'll pick something up and leave.

674
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,020
Another business affair?

675
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:29,940
Where have you been

676
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:30,780
after school?

677
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:32,940
Momo!

678
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,340
Momo, Momo!

679
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,020
Just ignore her.

680
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,380
She can stay in her room

681
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,300
as long as she wants.

682
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:44,380
Pack her things.

683
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,320
She'll transfer schools.

684
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,660
Transfer?

685
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,180
What transfer?

686
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,380
I already talked to

687
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,900
Mr. Zhou this afternoon.

688
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,300
We wanted

689
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,640
to transfer you to the girls' school
in the first place,

690
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,060
but your mom didn't agree.

691
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,180
Now we're all moving there to avoid

692
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,020
future troubles.

693
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,020
Why?

694
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,040
I won't transfer schools!

695
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,420
This is not a discussion

696
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,260
but an announcement.

697
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,140
I don't agree.

698
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,500
I don't care!

699
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,380
I'm doing this for you,

700
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,780
for your benefit, okay?

701
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,500
For me? Have you thought about
my feelings?

702
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,520
I don't care how you feel!

703
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,580
Think about

704
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,420
what you've done!

705
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,860
- What did I do?
- Stop!

706
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,060
Momo

707
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,300
- won't transfer.
- Shut up.

708
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,500
You've spoiled her.

709
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:26,860
If you hadn't spoiled her,

710
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,020
would she be so unruly?

711
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,300
Chen Pengyu, stop!

712
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,100
Do you really care about your daughter?

713
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,900
You keep saying
you're doing it for Momo.

714
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:43,980
Think about it.

715
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,100
When was the last time

716
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,620
you had a proper conversation with her?

717
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,180
Every time you come home,
you criticize us

718
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,580
for everything.

719
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,660
Whenever you get angry,
we're both so scared!

720
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,500
All these years,

721
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,420
we've been following you.

722
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,220
Every time you change jobs, we move,

723
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,220
and Momo transfers schools.

724
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,380
Think about it carefully.

725
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,420
How many schools

726
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,420
has she transferred to?

727
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:08,660
You always say

728
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,060
you're doing it for us.

729
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,780
Have you ever asked for our opinion?

730
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:15,660
Have you ever asked

731
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,660
what kind of life we want?

732
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,420
It's all for yourself.

733
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,820
You just want us

734
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,340
to be your accessories,

735
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,200
always listen to you,

736
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,620
and never contradict you,

737
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,460
don't you?

738
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,180
Chen Pengyu, listen,

739
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:35,860
this time,

740
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,620
I'm on Momo's side.

741
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,860
If you insist on transferring schools,

742
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:49,820
we'll get a divorce.

743
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,300
Zhao Rongfang!

744
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:55,820
Divorce?

745
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,020
Is divorce something

746
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,340
you can joke about?

747
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:06,460
No, I can't.

748
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,020
So,

749
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,380
I'm not joking with you.

750
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,380
You're going out for business.

751
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,780
So, think it through

752
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,460
and answer me.

753
