(Class 5, Grade 10)

26
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,200
Hi, come get your uniforms.

27
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,120
- What size?
- Qian Jiayue.

28
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,900
Size S.

29
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,190
Here's your uniform.

30
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,240
She can sit here.

31
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,520
Great, right behind us.

32
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,630
You sit here.

33
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,270
Okay.

34
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,960
Wonder if this fits me.

35
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,800
What's your size?

36
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,870
Old classmate?

37
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,080
Want to be my desk mates?

38
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,090
Wang Bin.

39
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,240
This is my first time
wearing a camo.

40
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,000
Me too.

41
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,630
Same here.

42
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,030
Hello,

43
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,240
I'm Wang Bin.

44
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,120
B-I-N, Bin.

45
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,400
Hi, I'm Chen Mo.

46
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,190
A talkative girl.

47
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,630
Talkativeness is good.

48
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,520
We were elementary classmates.

49
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,520
Small world.

50
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,470
All familiar faces.

51
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,710
Qian Jiayue, a task for you.

52
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,680
What task?

53
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,830
Introduce me

54
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,150
to that girl.

55
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,500
Didn't you just introduce yourself?

56
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,360
Not properly though.

57
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,240
Do it yourself.

58
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,190
Is he our teacher?

59
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,460
(Zhou Wei)

60
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,630
He's Zhou Wei,

61
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,840
a famous math teacher here.

62
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,750
It's Zhou Wei.

63
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,590
Hello, everyone.

64
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,560
My name is Zhou Wei.

65
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,150
From now on,

66
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,030
until you split into tracks
in Grade 12,

67
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,710
I will be homeroom teacher.

68
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,200
So,

69
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,840
I hope in the coming two years,

70
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,310
all 43 of you will

71
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,710
help each other

72
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,140
and care for one another.

73
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,710
Did everyone get your uniforms?

74
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,960
Yes.

75
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,360
Starting tomorrow,

76
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,090
we'll have three days
of military training.

77
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,240
During the period,

78
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,030
there're some class affairs to do.

79
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,750
So, I need

80
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,030
a temporary class leader.

81
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,750
Any volunteers?

82
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:59,910
She raised her hand first.

83
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,080
Alright, the first volunteer.

84
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,360
My name is Pei Dongni.

85
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,360
Pei Dongni.

86
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,710
Great, it's you then.

87
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,470
Clap for her.

88
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,510
You're now class leader.

89
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,830
Say a few words to everyone.

90
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,950
Thanks for your trust.

91
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,430
I'll do my best

92
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,390
to complete this task

93
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,270
and live up to your expectations.

94
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,960
(Shanghai Puyang No.2 Middle School)

95
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,560
- Hurry up.
- Coming.

96
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,160
Keep pace.

97
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,240
Pick up the pace.

98
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,680
Ka Men, Ka Men.

99
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,520
Let's sit over there.

100
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,400
Sure.

101
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,240
Liu Wanqing, Qian Jiayue,

102
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,560
move to the front.

103
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,400
There are seats there.

104
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,590
Chop chop.

105
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:57,510
Been slacking, right?

106
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,480
You're not even tanned.

107
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,040
Mr. Zhou.

108
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
Ran, can you slide over?

109
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,440
Sure.

110
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,880
Thanks.

111
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,510
So close to the stage.

112
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,040
How will we sneak out later?

113
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,150
Sneak out for what?

114
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,920
No training this afternoon.

115
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,800
The video store has new CDs.

116
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,030
Ka Men and I are planning

117
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,320
to check them out.

118
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,200
Join us?

119
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,080
Yeah, come along.

120
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,000
- But…
- This meeting is boring.

121
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,190
Nothing worth hearing.

122
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,160
But sneaking out is risky.

123
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,510
The teacher will notice.

124
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,680
I'll claim sick,

125
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,390
and you two can help me home.

126
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,000
Sound plan.

127
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,680
What about the meeting?

128
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:39,870
Come on. Join us.

129
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:40,710
Yeah, exactly.

130
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,560
You guys can just sit here.

131
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,030
Zhao Tingting,

132
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,160
you're the first to speak.

133
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,190
Come with me.

134
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,360
Xiao Han, wait here.

135
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,750
Brother Xiao Han.

136
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,560
Jiayue.

137
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,190
You're going to give a speech later?

138
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,030
Yes.

139
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,190
Break a leg.

140
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,510
Who's that?

141
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,600
Jiayue's next-door neighbor.

142
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,560
Former president
of student council here.

143
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,870
Student leader, no wonder.

144
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,270
Alright, get ready.

145
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,310
Everyone, keep quiet.

146
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:09,790
Next up,

147
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,260
the opening ceremony

148
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,750
starts now.

149
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,860
Let me introduce myself.

150
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,860
I'm Wu Chunhua,

151
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,940
the Dean of Students.

152
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,820
A sharp sword from grinding,

153
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,660
a fragrant plum from the bitter cold.

154
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,500
I hope every student here

155
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,740
can be strict with yourself.

156
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,820
Let's welcome student delegate

157
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,660
Zhao Tingting from Class 1, Grade 10.

158
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,220
Let's hear it for her.

159
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,700
(Journey Ahead, Bright Future)

160
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,020
Hello, everyone.

161
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,140
I'm Zhao Tingting from Class 1.

162
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,940
After a long summer break,

163
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,260
we're finally here.

164
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,320
As we all know,

165
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,500
as high school students…

166
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,620
Keep it down.

167
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,420
- About studying…
- Qian Jiayue, I really admire you.

168
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,500
You can actually listen to
such a boring speech

169
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,660
and take it seriously.

170
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,020
Talking about revising properly,

171
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:13,740
preparing well,

172
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,740
and summarizing mistakes.

173
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,420
Like we're kindergarten kids.

174
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,340
If you don't want to listen,

175
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,740
please don't disturb others.

176
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,940
I'm also ready

177
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,860
to face the challenges.

178
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,060
Doesn't he remind you

179
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,100
of that smug hypocrite

180
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,020
Loner in The Smiling, Proud Wanderer?

181
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,300
Don't be mean!

182
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,860
Today, we're proud
to be a student here.

183
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,700
Tomorrow, the school will
be proud of us.

184
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,780
Thank you.

185
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,300
Great speech.

186
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,380
Next,

187
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,900
let's welcome Xiao Han
from Class 1, Grade 10,

188
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,820
to give a speech.

189
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,260
He will share with us all…

190
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,160
Are you really leaving?

191
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,660
- About the issue…
- Let's go.

192
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,940

- Let's go together!
- Please welcome.

194
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,700
- What's wrong?
- Sir,

195
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,060
I feel sick. I need to go home.

196
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,260
Is it serious? I can...

197
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,660
No need. I'll take her.

198
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,500
Alright.

199
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:15,060
Hello, everyone,
I am Xiao Han from Class 1.

200
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,260
It's an honor

201
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,660
to share my opinion

202
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,140
about setting goals.

203
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,780
According to the dictionary,

204
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,300
the "goal" refers to

205
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,460
one's intention.

206
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,740
It's the voice from the heart.

207
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,820
"A tree without roots won't grow."

208
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,440
"A person without a goal won't succeed."

209
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,500
Since childhood, my dream has been

210
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,620
to attend Shanghai Jiaotong University.

211
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,300
Aspiration is a goal we strive for.

212
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,500
"Setting goals"

213
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,620
is planning a clear roadmap

214
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,740
from present to future

215
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,100
and a conversation

216
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,260

220
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,460
Jiayue, you're back.

221
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,140
Where's Qing?

222
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,060
She's not home yet?

223
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,300
Not yet.

224
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,740
Why isn't she with you?

225
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,900
She left with a classmate.

226
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,340
Who? Why didn't you go with them?

227
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,460
They might have something to do.

228
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,420
I'm going home.

229
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,940
Do you want a soda?

230
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:33,820
No, thanks.

Hi, Reed, I'm here.

Hello.

250
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,700

252
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,860
Maybe it's because I was attracted

to your username.

254
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,380

00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,540

00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,540

Chen Mo.

270
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,300
What's wrong?

271
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,820
Qian Jiayue,

272
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,620
you ratted us out, right?

273
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,860
About what?

274
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,700
See?

275
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,260
I knew she wouldn't admit it.

276
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,300
Ka Men.

277
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,700
What's all this?

278
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,300
Well,

279
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,420
someone told Mr. Zhou

280
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,980
that Chen Mo faked a stomachache
to sneak away.

281
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,300
So Mr. Zhou called her dad,

282
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,940
and her dad scolded her.

283
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,700
- Well…
- So it wasn't you

284
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,700
who reported us, right?

285
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,940
It wasn't me.

286
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,460
I don't think it was her.

287
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,660
Only she knew our plan.

288
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,020
It could only be her.

289
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,860
Some people pretend to be nice

290
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,740
but backstab others.

291
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,700
Chen Mo,

292
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:58,820
it really wasn't me.

293
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,820
Stop pretending.

294
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,740
Ka Men,

295
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,020
tell me,

296
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,620
do you believe me?

297
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,700
Mr. Zhou called my parents too.

298
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,940
He even knew
about us buying CDs.

299
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,820
My mom yelled at me too.

300
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,180
Qian Jiayue.

301
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,260
She's still denying it.

302
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,420
Chen Mo.

303
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,460
Chen Mo.

304
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,420
That's just nonsense.

305
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,900
Saying goodbye?

306
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,660
Where do you come up with this?

307
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,780
Where's your dad?

308
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,540
Are you out of your mind?

309
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,100
Your dad wants to sell you?

310
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,700
Put that down.

311
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,860
Buy what?

312
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,700
Selling, not buying.

313
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,660
Mao Tou said

314
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,060
his dad wanted to sell him.

315
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:12,420
Sell you?

316
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,220
Perfect then.

317
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,820
He can sell you to me.

318
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,660
I'll give him the money.

319
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,260
I need a son anyway.

320
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,460
Believe it or not.

321
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,700
I'm leaving.

322
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,220
Stop right there.

323
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,100
What's going on?

324
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,030
- Put your bags down.
- Put them down.

325
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,540
Put them down.

326
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,380
It's so heavy.

327
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,860
What's in here?

328
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,220
Sister Jiayue, these are my
prized comic books.

329
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,380
They're for you.

330
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,420
Hope they'll remind you of me.

331
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,500
And these,

332
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,860
all my game consoles

333
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,220
and game cards,

334
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,500
are for Brother Xiao Han.

335
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,140
Pass them to him for me.

336
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,700
These are everything I own.

337
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,420
I leave them all to you.

338
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,620
God-grandma, Godmother,

339
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,460
I have no money

340
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,500
or anything to give you.

341
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,700
I'm leaving now.

342
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:05,950
Come back.

343
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,020
Quick, call Little San.

344
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,220
Tell him to get here now.

345
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,660
God-grandma,

346
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,690
don't bother calling him.

347
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:13,860
Stop right there!

348
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,460
Where are you going?

349
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,300
Nobody leaves.

350
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,820
Put your bag down.

351
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,300
He really intends to sell me.

352
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,220
Zhang Qiming's asking for trouble.

353
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,860
- Sit down.
- Why don't you believe me?

354
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,140
- He intends to sell me to Shandong.
- Sit here.

355
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,940
He doesn't listen to me.

356
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,620
Brother Xiao Han.

357
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,100
Coming.

358
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,260
- Brother Xiao Han.
- What's wrong?

359
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,340
Mao Tou is at my house.

360
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,690
He's threatening to run away again.

361
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:51,720
You'd better come with me.

362
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,740
Again?

363
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,260
This time, it feels serious.

364
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,220
Who's planning to run away?

365
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,640
Mao Tou.

366
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,820
He said his dad wants to sell him.

367
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:01,780
Bro,

368
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,860
go to Portman now?

369
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,940
I can't make it there now.

370
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,780
I'll call you later.

371
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,120
Bye.

372
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:12,620
Little imp.

373
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,500
You troublemaker.

374
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,520
Ruining my business.

375
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,460
Coming.

376
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,020
Sobered up?

377
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,260
It's nothing serious.

378
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,260
Why make it a big deal?

379
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,940
Nothing serious?

380
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,260
A tribunal.

381
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,300
Be careful.

382
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,300
What's there to fear?

383
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,140
I didn't push him into the fire.

384
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,740
Little imp.

385
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,220
What are you doing?

386
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,100
Madam,

387
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,540
why are you still up?

388
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,620
You'll get dark circles.

389
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,460
That won't look good.

390
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,300
I'll smack you!

391
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,140
He's just a kid.

392
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,340
Aiping.

393
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,340
Everyone's here, huh?

394
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:05,740
It's so late already.

395
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,460
Get Han to rest.

396
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,860
Don't let this affect his study.

397
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,300
It's not a big deal,

398
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,380
really.

399
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,740
What are you doing?

400
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,820
Is this your first day with him?

401
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,340
You all know Mao Tou.

402
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,660
You believe what he says?

403
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:21,620
Little San,

404
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,820
are you brainless?

405
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,740
Mao Tou told us

406
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,260
that you plan to sell him

407
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,780
to Shandong.

408
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,820
Is this true?

409
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,610
Come on.

410
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,300
I took him to see a doctor.

411
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,860
You make me sound
like a human trafficker.

412
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,280
What's wrong with him?

413
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,900
What illness?

414
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,020
Stop interrogating me.

415
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,260
Well, well.

416
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,900
Let me sit down first.

417
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,540
So what's his problem?

418
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,620
You know

419
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,860
what he usually does.

420
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,620
He still won't admit it…

421
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,460
Won't admit.

422
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,020
The teacher says

423
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,180
he's a troublemaker.

424
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,220
You all didn't know

425
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,580
the teacher chewed me out

426
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,300
in the office that day.

427
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,420
You've forgotten

428
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,100
what you were like as a kid?

429
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,500
This is called karma,

430
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,060
and it's spot-on.

431
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,220
- Enough.
- I'm just stating facts.

432
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,660
He has two choices now:

433
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:11,900
getting expelled

434
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:12,940
or quitting school.

435
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,700
What should I do?

436
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,660
How'd that happen?

437
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,660
Mao Tou,

438
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,740
you go to school

439
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,660
and write a promise.

440
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:25,140
Youngsters can't skip school.

441
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,780
Don't make him write it.

442
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,100
His promises are empty words.

443
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,260
I don't even want to watch it.

444
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,260
I'm definitely taking him to Shandong.

445
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,620
A friend said

446
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,700
there's a Dr. Yang

447
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,500
who treats his condition.

448
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,020
What kind of doctor is that?

449
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,420
He specializes in…

450
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,860
some kind of mental issue.

451
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,820
Zhang Qiming,

452
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,060
you mean he's mentally ill?

453
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,980
You're the crazy one!

454
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,300
If not obeying means having illness,

455
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,220
then your history with it

456
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,740
is ancient.

457
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,420
- Stop it.
- Am I right?

458
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,500
Look at

459
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,500
what he packed

460
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,620
for running away.

461
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,460
Comics,

462
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,700
games…

463
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,180
He's not focusing on his studies.

464
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,260
He skips school,

465
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,940
plays computer games,

466
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,460
and even blackmails people.

467
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,020
If I don't step in,

468
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,140
he's doomed.

469
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,420
It's on the paper,

470
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,460
that computer game

471
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,940
is a digital addiction.

472
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:14,900
It's addictive.

473
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,540
That doctor specializes
in internet addiction.

474
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,380
Do you know that?

475
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,260
If not, just stop talking.

476
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,500
That doctor's

477
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,500
own son

478
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,300
was also addicted
to gaming online.

479
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,620
So he came up with a method

480
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,460
to help his son quit effectively.

481
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,740
Once kids get hooked on the internet,

482
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,860
it's as hard to quit as any addiction.

483
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,860
Without help,

484
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,020
he'll never quit.

485
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,180
What help?

486
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,100
God-grandma,

487
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,780
that doctor uses electroshock.

488
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,900
That's cruelty.

489
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:43,820
Little imp.

490
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,740
Running away, huh?

491
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,100
You drove me to it!

492
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,660
First ADHD,

493
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,700
now is mental illness.

494
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,100
You're the one who's sick!

495
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,040
Don't hit him!

496
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,020
- Use your words.
- I'm sick?

497
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:55,860
Use your words.

498
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:56,820
Do words work?

499
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,020
He said I'm sick.

500
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,300
He has two choices now:

501
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,020
quitting school

502
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:03,980
or getting expelled.

503
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,820
That's digital poison.

504
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,740
If I don't stop him, he's doomed.

505
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,660
Enough.

506
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:14,630
Mao Tou.

507
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,420
I have ADHD.

508
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,700
I have mental illness.

509
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,660
You made me this way!

510
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,740
Proving I'm sick makes you happy?

511
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:25,960
Little imp.

512
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,860
No matter what,

513
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,140
you have to go to Shandong.

514
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,740
I'll say it again.

515
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,170
I won't go!

516
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,060
- Mao Tou.
- Say it again!

517
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:35,900
I won't go!

518
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,660
Say again!

519
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,900
Stop arguing, Mao Tou!

520
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,260
Over my dead body!

521
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,930
Today, I won't let you off.

522
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,090
- Zhang Qiming.
- Little imp.

523
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,660
I'll beat you to death!

524
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,940
- Get out of here.
- Little imp.

525
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,760
Mao Tou,

526
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:48,740
go downstairs first.

527
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,540
Zhang Qiming!

528
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,460
I'll go with him.

529
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,240
Han, let me go.

530
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,660
No way!

531
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,180
This is none of your business.

532
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,340
Mao Tou is my brother.

533
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,740
I won't let you hit him.

534
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,940
Mind your business!

535
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,340
What right do you have to interfere?

536
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,940
Who do you think you are?

537
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:05,860
Zhang Qiming,

538
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,180
we're not your family

539
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,660
and don't have right to interfere!

540
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:21,820
That's not what I meant.

541
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,140
I'm telling you

542
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,060
that's no way to be a parent!

543
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,020
Do you think giving him money

544
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,260
makes you his father?

545
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,420
Think about

546
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,340
how he grew up.

547
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,660
His mother wasn't around.

548
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,260
How much time did you spend with him?

549
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,660
When you're happy,

550
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,540
you hug him;

551
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,340
when angry, you hit him.

552
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,460
Now that doesn't work,
you're sending him away?

553
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,700
You're not a qualified dad.

554
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,420
Do you know

555
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,300
some people would give anything

556
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,060
to watch their kids grow up,

557
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,090
but

558
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,270
they don't get the chance?

559
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,740
I'm sorry, Han.

560
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,700
I'm so sorry.

561
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:26,900
Alright.

562
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,980
Take a seat.

563
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,860
Come on, have a seat.

564
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,580
Sit down.

565
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,660
Why get so angry?

566
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,780
No more hitting!

567
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,020
You shouldn't act like this.

568
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,460
Come home with me.

569
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,020
Did you hear me?

570
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,020
Let's go.

571
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:18,940
Hey, girl,

572
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,660
he doesn't want to leave.

573
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,860
Don't force him.

574
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,660
What's it to you?

575
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,540
Hey, watch your tone, girl.

576
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,860
Don't scare her.

577
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:30,940
Listen, girl,

578
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,060
take my advice.

579
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,260
You go home first.

580
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,060
I'll talk to your boyfriend.

581
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,140
He'll come back soon.

582
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,380
Just leave now.

583
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,460
Are you leaving?

584
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,460
Are you asking for trouble, girl?

585
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,020
Enough, just go home.

586
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,060
Don't worry about me.

587
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,780
I won't leave if you don't.

588
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,820
Nobody can have fun today.

589
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,020
Let me warn you.

590
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,500
My patience has limits.

591
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,140
I'll count to three.

592
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,540
If you're still here,

593
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,300
you will suffer the consequences.

594
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,540
Three,

595
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,540
two.

596
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,300
Zhang Yang, are you leaving or not?

597
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,740
Girl, what are you doing?

598
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,860
Want to wreck my shop?

599
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,260
If you keep this up, I'll call the police.

600
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,940
Go ahead! Call them.

601
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,540
They're bullying a kid here!

602
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,900
What are you doing here?

603
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,300
What did I do?

604
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,060
If you cause trouble again,

605
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,540
I'll ban you all

606
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,660
from my shop.

607
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,460
Sorry, sir. My bad.

608
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:53,500
I'm sorry, bro.

609
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,780
Let's go.

610
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,820
We're leaving.

611
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,840
What happened?

612
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,420
Didn't you refuse to apologize?

613
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,460
I saw you apologize
to that man quickly.

614
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,420
He's my friend.

615
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,460
Besides, you started it.

616
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,420
Friend?

617
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,820
Don't hang out with those people.

618
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,100
Why?

619
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,460
What's wrong
with playing games together?

620
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,460
What do you mean why?

621
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,820
Mao Tou.

622
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,340
Mao Tou.

623
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,100
Fine, go ahead

624
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,100
and ruin yourself.

625
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,900
Nobody will mind you anymore.

626
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,940
Hang out

627
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,260
with whoever you want!

628
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,860
Aren't you the same?

629
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,820
After you and Brother Xiao Han
started high school,

630
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,100
you made lots of new friends.

631
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,140
School just started,

632
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,100
and you already seem so busy.

633
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,620
How long since you visited
our secret base?

634
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,420
You're all good students,

635
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,960
going to the top school,

636
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:56,780
making new friends,

637
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,020
and aiming for good colleges.

638
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:00,820
But what about me?

639
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,300
I'm just a

640
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,700
little imp no one cares about.

641
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,220
Do you know,

642
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,460
the only time I feel cool

643
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,780
and feel liked

644
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,660
is when I'm playing games

645
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,380
with them.

646
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,140
Why do you need to be liked?

647
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,540
Even if you're close now,

648
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,260
one day, they'll change.

649
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:32,020
They'll get bored of you,

650
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,020
replace you and gang up on you.

651
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,220
Fine.

652
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,020
I know you're upset.

653
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,940
But many people care about you.

654
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,100
Granny, my mom,

655
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,810
Brother Xiao Han, and me.

656
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,620
We all care about you.

657
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,260
So stop acting like

658
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,220
the world's against you.

659
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,540
And your dad

660
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,700
cares about you too.

661
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,620
He's just liked my mom,

662
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,460
a bit extreme in his ways.

663
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,300
It's different.

664
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,460
Your mom might be extreme,

665
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,700
but my dad is violent.

666
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,500
Understand?

667
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,660
But,

668
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,740
you're so cool when you smashed

669
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,020
that bottle in the arcade.

670
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,300
Just like Little Sister Thirteen
from gang movie.

671
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,900
So impressive.

672
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,820
Oh, my gosh.

673
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,540
Little Sister Thirteen?

674
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,820
I'm your elder sister!

675
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,260
Alright,

676
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,420
let's head home.

677
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:46,660
Fine, you're Elder Sister Thirteenth.

678
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,340
I must tell Brother Xiao Han about this.

679
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:50,220
- You smashed the bottle…
- Don't you dare!

680
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,660
That was so cool!

681
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,420
We're back.

682
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,940
Where did you go?

683
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,180
Does it hurt?

684
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:50,780
Let's head home.

685
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,500
We're heading back now.

686
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,820
Alright, take care.

687
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,860
Sorry about this.

688
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,540
We're leaving now.

689
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,940
I'll carry it.

690
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,180
We're off.

691
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,180
Take care.

692
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,660
Alright then.

693
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,260
Alright.

694
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,100
It's okay.

695
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,780
Have a seat.

696
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:54,380
(Yingmo Community)

697
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,380
It's so late already.

698
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,400
The teacher even called home.

699
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,560
She's still messing around.

700
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,020
Come in.

701
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:19,790
Momo.

702
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,460
Have some fruit.

703
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,260
Look at you, still pouting.

704
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,100
Come on.

705
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,420
Your military training's ending soon,

706
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,020
and then school starts, right?

707
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,900
Don't be mad at your dad.

708
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,500
He's just thinking about you.

709
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,420
You studied hard to get into this school.

710
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,180
Shouldn't you work

711
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,260
even harder now?

712
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,820
And stop reading all this junk.

713
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,740
Who said I'm not ready to study?

714
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,420
School hasn't even started yet.

715
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,560
That ceremony was so boring,

716
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,500
full of empty talk.

717
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,780
What's there to listen to?

718
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:05,740
Every school

719
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,060
has rules.

720
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,940
Otherwise, things get chaotic.

721
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:11,660
Only three of you skipped.

722
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:13,540
Three?

723
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,900
Who said that?

724
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:16,420
Mr. Zhou.

725
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:17,970
He said it was you, Ka Men

726
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,420
and another guy.

727
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:22,020
He got caught at an internet café.

728
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,420
Another guy?

729
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,740
I did see a guy that looked familiar.

730
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,300
I think he's me and Jiayue's

731
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,500
middle school schoolmates.

732
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,140
His name is...

733
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,420
Wang Jia.

734
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,500
Sorry about that.

735
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,660
It was me.

736
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,460
I was caught by Wu Chunhua

737
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,100
right at the internet café.

738
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,860
Scared the life out of me.

739
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,740
So you ratted us out?

740
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,180
Actually,

741
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:02,910
I saw you at the music store.

742
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,060
But later, Mrs. Wu tricked me.

743
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,700
She said someone told her

744
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,420
I was at the internet café.

745
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,500
I thought it was you.

746
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,060
Then I spilled by accident.

747
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:14,940
You…

748
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,140
Sorry about that.

749
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,280
Sorry again.

750
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,300
We misunderstood Jiayue.

751
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:48,700
Take it easy.

752
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,900
I don't need your help.

753
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,460
Just ease the bicycle forward.

754
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,500
Don't pedal directly.

755
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,020
I don't need your advice.

756
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,780
We're no longer friends.

757
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,500
I don't agree with that.

758
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,020
I don't need your approval.

759
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:08,880
We…

760
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:11,020
we misunderstood you, Qian Jiayue.

761
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,180
It wasn't you.

762
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,540
It was Wang Jia.

763
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,900
He's already admitted it.

764
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,540
I apologize to you.

765
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,220
I don't need your apology.

766
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,580
I'm sorry.

767
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,860
Chen Mo doesn't know you,

768
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,620
but I do.

769
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:51,980
I…

770
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,940
I shouldn't have let her doubt you.

771
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,180
And

772
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,620
I promised to teach you to ride,

773
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,100
but I didn't keep my word.

774
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,220
I…

775
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,620
I only thought about
having fun with Chen Mo.

776
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,460
Ka Men,

777
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,220
I've always considered you

778
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,340
my very best friend.

779
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,060
I also consider you

780
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:17,020
my very best friend.

781
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,160
Give it to me.

782
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:33,430
What?

783
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,900
Photos of Rukawa.

784
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,420
I asked the shopkeeper,

785
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,740
and he said you bought it.

786
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:44,900
Thank you.

787
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,740
I didn't say it was for you.

788
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,980
You're so fickle.

789
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,660
That's not true.

790
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:54,020
I might make new friends,

791
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,900
but I never abandon the old ones.

792
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,340
Jiayue,

793
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,740
do you know why

794
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,140
I like Chen Mo so much?

795
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,580
Every time I see her,

796
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,540
it feels like she's standing

797
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,820
in the center of the stage,

798
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:20,220
with all the lights on her.

799
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,300
Maybe it's because

800
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,940
I'm just a spectator now.

801
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,700
So I want to be closer to that light

802
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,100
and the stage center,

803
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,460
imagining

804
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,020
her light might shine on me

805
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,020
a little too.

806
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,740
Do you think I'm silly?

807
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,100
Completely silly.

808
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,300
You called me silly.

809
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,580
Alright.

810
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,820
They might be a bit wrinkled.

811
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,260
It's okay.

812
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,590
Rukawa!

813
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,700
Qian Jiayue, you're the best.

814
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:10,290
By the way,

815
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,260
this is from Chen Mo.

816
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,020
She wants to say sorry, too.

817
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,980
I don't want it.

818
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,540
Fine.

819
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:28,700
If you don't hang it,

820
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,380
then I won't either.

821
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,780
What are you doing?

822
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,580
Don't do that!

823
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,180
Fine.

824
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,230
This green one…

825
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,580
Green's great!

826
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:45,380
It matches the red one perfectly.

827
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,420
See?

828
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,820
Doesn't it?

829
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,580
Tomorrow when we pick seats,

830
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,420
are you sitting with me

831
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,940
or her?

832
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,260
Of course I'm sitting…

833
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:04,140
(Class 5, Grade 10)

834
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:08,990
No way!

835
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:10,780
Why?

836
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,640
(Pei Dongni, Liu Wanqing,
Chen Mo, Qian Jiayue)

837
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,500
Aren't seats freely chosen?

838
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,380
Who told you that?

839
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,180
This is from Mr. Zhou.

840
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,980
Everyone,

841
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,230
please sit according to this seating chart.

842
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,780
(Sorry)

843
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,540
I misunderstood you.

844
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,380
Please forgive me.

845
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,540
And…

846
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,620
look.

847
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:10,940
Here you are.

848
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,540
This…

849
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,220
this is my pen!

850
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,100
How did you find it?

851
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,580
My friend said

852
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,860
it was on the restroom counter.

853
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,820
Could you please think again?

854
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:25,860
Ma'am,

855
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:28,260
that pen means a lot to my friend.

856
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,300
Please help me out.

857
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,100
I left all the lost junk

858
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,030
in here.

859
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,460
Dig through yourself.

860
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,420
It's no big deal.

861
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,300
I just asked the cleaning lady.

862
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,420
Thank you.

863
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,940
I'm really grateful.

864
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,060
My pen.

865
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,660
Look at this.

866
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,260
(Jiale Wontons)

867
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,020
Pei, your shop saved me.

868
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:23,260
It's nothing.

869
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,660
Why didn't you bring an umbrella?

870
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,500
You're all wet.

871
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,020
Let me get you a towel.

872
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,980
I just can't understand

873
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:37,100
going out without an umbrella
on a rainy day.

874
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,260
The forecast said no rain today!

875
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,700
I checked it

876
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,660
specially.

877
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,980
I took an umbrella out,

878
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,060
and then I put it back.

879
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,410
I shouldn't have trusted it.

880
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,580
Let me adjust the fan for you,

881
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,590
so it doesn't blow on you.

882
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:49,820
Thanks.

883
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,780
Fangfang, right?

884
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,220
Thank you, Fangfang.

885
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:53,980
Zhao Rongfang.

886
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,660
Zhao Rongfang.

887
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,500
Thank you.

888
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,500
You live around here, right?

889
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:02,820
I often see you around here.

890
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,220
I live at Yingmo Community,

891
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,940
left at the intersection.

892
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,060
Oh, we're so close!

893
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,580
Just one street apart!

894
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:11,940
We're practically neighbors.

895
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,020
Neighbors?

896
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,700
Not really.

897
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,460
You're in elevator apartments.

898
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,100
We're in walk-up

899
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,230
old housing.

900
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,580
Elevator or not,

901
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,260
we all sleep

902
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,980
and eat the same.

903
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,220
I'm telling you that Pei and I

904
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,770
used to live in old walk-ups.

905
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,900
So lively, right?

906
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,260
Everyone was like family.

907
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,180
So close to each other.

908
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,220
Always so cheerful.

909
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,620
Xiu'e,

910
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:39,860
why don't you sit?

911
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,020
Standing must be tiring.

912
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:42,820
I'm fine.

913
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,780
I'm okay standing.

914
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,180
She's fine.

915
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,100
Let her stand!

916
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,780
No need to sit down.

917
00:40:58,750 --> 00:40:59,660
What do we do?

918
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,100
Rain's suddenly pouring down.

919
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,460
I was craving a fried chicken cutlet!

920
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,380
Now I'm drooling.

921
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,780
And grilled sausage.

922
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,980
And milk tea.

923
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,140
Ka Men.

924
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,220
Chen Mo.

925
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,060
Qian Jiayue.

926
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,180
Didn't you bring an umbrella?

927
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,470
No, I didn't.

928
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,700
Thanks, but what about you?

929
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,860
Ka Men and I can share one.

930
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,260
No, no, no.

931
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,820
You two share.

932
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,840
I…

933
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,020
Forget the Xidian Mall.

934
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,190
Let's go to my place instead!

935
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,500
You haven't been to my house.

936
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,010
- Sure.
- Let's go.

937
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,540
Let's go!

938
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:48,180
Feels like the boat of friendship
is setting sail.

939
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:53,580
Fangfang,

940
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,740
doesn't your husband have a driver?

941
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:57,780
You could call him

942
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,300
to pick you up.

943
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:03,180
He's all about work

944
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,380
and doesn't have time for me.

945
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,570
I won't trouble him with it.

946
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,260
Her husband's super busy.

947
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,860
Mine's busy too.

948
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,740
But if I call Qian Kang

949
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,780
and say

950
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,760
I'm caught in the rain,

951
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,180
he'd take time off

952
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,140
and pick me up.
