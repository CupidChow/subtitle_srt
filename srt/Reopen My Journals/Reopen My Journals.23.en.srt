to see the Leonids?

34
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,400
I heard this one

35
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,930
is a once-in-a-hundred-years event.

36
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,090
The activity is organized by
Brother Xiao Han's club.

37
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:09,610
And it's happening

38
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,210
on the second day of our rural research.

39
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,930
This trip is going to be so amazing!

40
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,090
A meteor shower...

41
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,210
It is not that interesting.

42
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,610
Plus, our main task this time

43
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:24,770
is the research, right?

44
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,210
It's not in conflict.

45
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,560
We can do research during the day and watch

46
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,560
the Leonids at night.

47
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,210
I'll bring my camera.

48
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,400
We can take a picture together

49
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,290
for the school journal.

50
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:35,330
Seriously,

51
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,680
why do you insist on carrying out

52
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,450
the economic study of fishing villages?

53
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,330
Why not join our water quality team?

54
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,770
Our water quality research team is basically

55
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,050
the "do-nothing" team.

Jiayue wants an article
for the school journal.

57
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,680
If she joins us, she'll mess it up.

58
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,430
I prefer interacting with people

59
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,050
rather than investigating water.

60
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,120
After lunch,

61
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,280
let's head to Xidian Mall

62
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,140
to buy snacks, like...

63
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,210
ham sausages and chips.

64
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,680
We can eat them on the way.

65
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,040
But didn't they say

66
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,170
we can't bring snacks?

67
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,520
- Hide them.
- Hide them.

68
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,680
Take it!

69
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,400
Take it back!

70
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,710
It's not safe to leave it to me.

71
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,400
I'm going to a fishing village soon.

72
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,280
It won't be safe since I'm away.

73
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,240
But

74
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,890
if you leave it with me,
I won't be safe!

75
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:27,730
You have no idea.

76
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,720
After you left that day,

77
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,740
my dad hit me really hard!

78
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,660
Just look for yourself!

79
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:31,730
Look!

80
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,360
Hard indeed.

81
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,400
At the moment, I almost

82
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,680
exploded with anger!

83
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,090
I was furious!

84
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,520
Didn't you say you wanted
to be a kind father?

85
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,280
Mao Tou just achieved his goal

86
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,240
and now you're hitting him again.

87
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,890
- You have no heart.
- Exactly.

88
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,240
It's two separate matters.

89
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:51,840
Yesterday I went to

90
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,890
the old house to get something,

91
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,240
and oddly,

92
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,120
I couldn't

93
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,770
open the door

94
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,090
either way.

95
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,180
Mao Tou!

96
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,240
Little imp, why did you lock the door?

97
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,330
Open it!

98
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,680
Do you hear me?

99
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,670
I'll count to three.
Don't let me kick it down!

100
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:13,650
One!

101
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,680
Two!

102
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,610
Three!

103
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,570
Hello, Mr. Zhang!

104
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,520
Hello, Mr. Zhang!

105
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,480
Hello, hello.

106
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:40,770
The DVDs are still here!

107
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,560
Is your throat sore?

108
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,410
It's just for fun.

109
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,210
I'm leaving. Excuse me.

110
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,680
Dad.

111
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,480
Why did you lock the door during the day?

112
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,250
I... I... We...

113
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:58,530
We...

114
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,920
We were playing sheng ji!

115
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:02,810
Can five people play?

116
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,880
How?

117
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,450
By watching.

118
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,280
I was just watching them.

119
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,330
Little imp, were you gambling?

120
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,170
Cricket betting?

121
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:11,930
No!

122
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:12,850
Seriously.

123
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,960
If you are, you're in big trouble.

124
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,400
You guys have a pretty unique posture

125
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,330
playing cards.

126
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,390
Did you bring this from home?

127
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,050
It's for studying.

128
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:32,730
Move aside!

129
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,920
Studying?

130
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:40,960
Watching and learning.

131
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,570
At the same time?

132
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,160
No wonder the TV is so hot.

133
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,800
What's the character in the middle?

134
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,330
(Late Night Temptation)
It's Japanese.

135
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,770
Late Night... Temptation

136
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:08,930
Learning Japanese?

137
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:11,530
Exactly.

138
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,570
You guys are learning so many languages!

139
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,280
Was I right about this?

140
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,130
Yes, just like you thought.

141
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,250
Mao Tou has really grown into

142
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,130
a young man now.

143
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,160
Your little child is a young man now!

144
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,690
After all, Mao Tou

145
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,720
is going through...

146
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,090
puberty, right?

147
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,600
Just take away the DVDs

148
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,210
and have a word with him.

149
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,840
- Why hit him?
- Why?

150
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,970
There's a whole bag of DVDs,

151
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:02,530
not just one.

152
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,210
A group of little imps are watching!

153
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,250
Confucius once said,

154
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,480
"In youth, one must guard against desires

155
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:10,690
for one's energy is unsettled."

156
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,010
- What's he doing?
- If you don't

157
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,040
discipline him now,

158
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,880
he'll never learn!

159
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,400
He'll even end up in the hands

160
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,520
of the police later!

161
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,920
He'll cause trouble!

162
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,040
You should think about your own youth.

163
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,570
Chen Jianjun and Chen Jianguo

164
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,010
were such well-behaved boys,

165
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,360
and you forced them
to take a hand-copied book!

166
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,720
Look! Look!

167
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,720
Yeah, it's you.

168
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,690
Come on!

169
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,040
I didn't force them!

170
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,930
I barely pulled it out,

171
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,840
and they snatched it!

172
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,010
"I don't want it!"

173
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,280
"I really don't want it!"

174
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,690
Did I force them?

175
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,320
They were acting!

176
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,130
Mao Tou

177
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,720
really is your son.

178
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,360
He's exactly like you!

179
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,570
Come on! No way!

180
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:44,600
Don't you remember?

181
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,650
Back then, you took Liu Dagui
and the others

182
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:47,520
to the video store.

183
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,360
Forgot about that?

184
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,120
"Others"?

185
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,250
Does that

186
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,400
include Qian Kang?

187
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,400
Little San, did Qian Kang go?

188
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,650
Pei, did Qian Kang go?

189
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,040
The sunflower seeds got a bit soggy,

190
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,650
and not as tasty anymore.

191
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,450
Get me some chili sauce.

192
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,890
My analysis is this.

193
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,250
Since the punishment

194
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,010
has already happened, it's done.

195
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,960
The most dangerous place is the safest.

196
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,090
Come on, man,

197
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,450
my dad checks all the time.

198
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,250
Both the old and new houses aren't safe!

199
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,400
It was almost dropped!

200
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:45,170
Hey, Brother Xiao.

201
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:46,330
What's up?

202
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,840
Aren't we the best of buddies?

203
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,210
Tell me what's going on.

204
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,170
Just tell me, yes or no.

205
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,090
Yes, yes.

206
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,210
This

207
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,050
is something

208
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,170
very important to me.

209
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,090
Keep it at your place

210
00:08:59,090 --> 00:08:59,930
for a few days.

211
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,390
I'll get it back after the research.

212
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,810
Since it's important,

213
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:03,650
why entrust it to me?

214
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,930
Don't ask.

215
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,640
- Just hide it.
- Wait, wait!

216
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,050
Unless you explain clearly.

217
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,000
Just for a few days!

218
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,320
I'm leaving.

219
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,170
So weird.

220
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:23,840
Your mom's back!

221
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,480
Chinese wolfberry fruit.

222
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,000
Sweet and mild.
Chinese wolfberry leaves...

223
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,050
Chinese wolfberry fruit.
Sweet and mild.

224
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,690
Han, I'm back.

225
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,240
Han, are you home?

226
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,080
I'm here.

227
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,290
Why are you out of breath?

228
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,050
I... I was packing

229
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:08,960
for the research.

230
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,720
By the way, where's Dad's telescope?

231
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,480
Our Astronomy Club is organizing

232
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,000
to watch the Leonid Meteor Shower.

233
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,050
I can't find it.

234
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:18,720
I'll look for it later.

235
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,000
Herba Patriniae.

236
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,050
It's bitter

237
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,120
and treats excessive heat.

Mao Tou?

241
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,800
That little imp

242
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,600
actually returned everything,

243
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:13,960
not a single DVD left.

244
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:16,960
What else

245
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,330
is there for me to do?

246
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,020
Hello,

247
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,210
Aiping.

248
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,800
Coming.

249
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,450
- I'm here.
- You came quickly.

250
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,640
When you call me,

251
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,120
I must show up quickly.

252
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,110
Take your clothes off first.

253
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,080
I'll come when I'm ready.

254
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:20,930
Zhang Qiming?

255
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,530
Zhang Qiming, where are you?

256
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,360
Didn't you ask me to take off my clothes

257
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,690
and get prepared in the bedroom?

258
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,290
I misunderstood!

259
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,530
But you did ask me
to take off my clothes!

264
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,170
Alright,

265
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,240
I've figured out the Governing Vessel.

266
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,330
Thank you, Lady Hero,

267
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,170
for unblocking my Ren and Du Meridians!

268
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,290
My internal strength
is improving rapidly now!

269
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,640
Aiping,

270
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,050
you're really working hard.

271
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,640
Didn't you already
get accepted into that TCM clinic?

272
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,930
It's not like I've been accepted yet.

273
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,570
Dr. Zhan said

274
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:18,760
out of six applicants,

275
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,600
only one will be chosen as an apprentice.

276
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,720
I need to buckle down on my studies.

277
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,570
I still remember at the factory,

278
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,570
there was Dr. Zhu.

279
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,330
Every time she wore her white coat,

280
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,480
I felt so envious.

281
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,240
Which Dr. Zhu?

282
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,880
You don't remember?

283
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,050

284
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,000
Lie there for a while.

285
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,480
I bought some moxibustion.

286
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,210
I'll do it on your Shen Zhu point

and practical activity this semester.

316

We have two topics for the research.

Each of you

318
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,600
will focus on one topic.

319
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,290
I know, when it comes to "research",

320
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,130
you probably think,

321
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:22,880
isn't this just a fall outing?

322
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,900
You can have fun,

323
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,700
but safety must come first.

00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,020

00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,140
have gone to the fishing village for fun,

353
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,060
why don't we go somewhere for fun too?

354
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,540
Let's go to...

355
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,660
You sit down first.

356
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,500
Sit.

in the new district.

365
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,940
They want him to go there and

366
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:49,980
take charge of it.

367
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,540
In charge? That's a promotion, right?

368
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,540
Sounds like a good thing!

369
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,180
What's so good about it?

370
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,300
When you're in charge,

371
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,420
you do all the tough work.

372
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,540
Once it's done,

373
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,680
some "important relative"
will come in to take over,

374
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,620
right?

375
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,530
If it doesn't go well,
he'll get all the blame!

376
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,260
That makes sense.

377
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,860
Pei, you sure know a lot.

378
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:11,660
Come on.

379
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,620
I've been in an office

380
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,820
for a few years, okay?

381
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,940
Chen's not afraid of

382
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,740
hard work

383
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,980
or responsibility,

384
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,220
but... going there

385
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,380
is like going to another city.

386
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,060
He'd only return every two months.

387
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,700
You can't bear to let Chen leave.

388
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,300
You complain about him being strict,

389
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,140
but look,

390
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,980
your marriage is still strong!

391
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,460
Please don't laugh at me.

392
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,300
If you can't bear him going,

393
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,060
- just tell him directly.
- Agreed.

394
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,500
But it's for work.

395
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,340
What can I say?

396
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,530
So what if it's for work?

397
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,460
This is about family!

398
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,060
What's a husband?

399
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,700
A husband

400
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,860
is supposed to be close to you.

401
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,180
Right?

402
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,380
Before he goes far away,

403
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,680
he should consider your feelings.

404
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,580
Exactly.

405
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,780
Just tell him,

406
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,580
"If you leave,

407
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,740
you'd better think about it,

408
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,100
because if you go, I'll divorce you!"

409
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,540
Fangfang's not good at being that harsh.

410
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:10,940
Not good?

411
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,060
I think that wouldn't work.

412
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,940
Then try being cute!

413
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,310
Being cute works!

414
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,540
We've been married for so many years.

415
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,700
It's too awkward to do that!

416
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,500
- What's awkward about it?
- Yeah.

417
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,620
Being cute is my specialty.

418
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,780
Yes, she's a pro!

419
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,780
I'm the role model here.

420
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,100
Let me show you the "cute act" trilogy.
Watch closely.

421
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,020
A trilogy, huh?

422
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,580
Not happy.

423
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,060
Are you really going, honey?

424
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,540
Do you really want to leave, honey?

425
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,540
I'm going to miss you so much!

426
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,780
Every time I miss you,

427
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,060
I just want to cry.

428
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,020
Hug me!

429
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,780
I'm about to cry already!

430
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,060
If I really acted like that,

431
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,060
would he never come back?

432
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,040
Of course!

433
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,320
Once he goes, he's gone forever!

434
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,060
Trust me.

435
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,340
It's so disgusting.

436
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,380
Am I disgusting?

437
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,380
You are disgusting!

438
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,100
Qian Kang never said that to me.

439
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,500
He's actually happy about it.

440
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,780
Well... Qian Kang really does love you.

441
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,620
- He really does.
- You try it.

442
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,300
Try being cute? I... I...

443
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,140
I can't.

444
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,980
Chen, you're home.

445
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,380
You got a minute?

446
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,100
I need to

447
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,700
talk to you about something.

448
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:31,860
What is it?

449
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,060
I'm about to head out.

450
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,340
Where are you going?

451
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,780
A social gathering.

452
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,260
- Here we are!
- You're back.

453
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,220
We're back.

454
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,000
Alright,

455
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,740
hand over the snacks.

456
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,020
What snacks?

457
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,380
There are no snacks.

458
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,500
I know you all brought some,

459
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,740
but the school rule is

460
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,540
no snacks during the research trip.

461
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:07,940
Hand them over.

462
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,420
Ka Men!

463
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,060
Carmen.

464
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,300
And you too, Wang.

465
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,620
Take them.

466
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:27,780
Is that it?

467
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,060
Nothing else?

468
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,380
I've given you everything.

469
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,500
Wang, give them to me.

470
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,220
And yours.

471
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,700
Chen Mo, yours as well.

472
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,820
I don't have any.

473
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,700
On the bus earlier,

474
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,980
I saw you eating chocolate.

475
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:55,900
Fine.

476
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,860
Here's everything.

477
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,140
Okay.

478
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:02,700
Qian Jiayue?

479
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,540
I didn't bring any.

480
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,060
You can check my bag.

481
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,940
No need. I trust you.

482
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,940
I'll go check the other rooms.

483
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,940
Bye!

484
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:16,610
Hurry, go check!

485
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,500
Is she far enough?

486
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,300
She's gone, she's gone.

487
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,380
You still have snacks?

488
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,160
If I have to

489
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,300
eat their food all the time,

490
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,780
I'd rather not live!

491
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,460
Qian Jiayue, you acted so well.

492
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,740
You got away with it.

493
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,460
Take the snacks out
and hide them!

494
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,300
I really didn't bring any.

495
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,060
Then you can eat ours!

496
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,300
Let's hide them, now!

497
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,320
Alright, I'll go close the door!

498
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,940
(Water Quality Research Team)

499
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,980
If you ask me,

500
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,300
it has to be…

501
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:55,780
Chen Mo.

502
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,620
Take it!

503
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,420
If we were to pick

504
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,220
the most beautiful girl in our grade,

505
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,820
Chen Mo would be the first one excluded.

506
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,220
What?

507
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,100
Don't you remember what you said

508
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,460
when school started last year?

509
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,500
You said, "Chen Mo

510
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,100
is the most beautiful girl!"

511
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,260
Have you forgotten?

512
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,620
Why do you keep bringing that up?

513
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,300
You bought fake shoes back then!

514
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,100
Stop changing the subject.

515
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,460
After two years of careful selection,

516
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,860
I've concluded that

517
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,460
the most beautiful girl is

518
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,540
Dai Chengxian from Class 7.

519
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,340
Who?

520
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,860
The one with long hair and jug ears?

521
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,580
Why do you have to be so mean?

522
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,700
Hey!

523
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,980
Not to mention Chen Mo.

524
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,220
Even if it's Pan Xiaoyue from Class 3,

525
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,060
she's prettier than Dai.

526
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,700
Right, Lu Yao?

527
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,820
Well, I'd still pick Chen Mo.

528
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,300
See?

529
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,340
The eyes of the people

530
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,380
are sharp.

531
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,300
Jianfeng, I ask you,

532
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,540
can we trust his opinion?

533
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,500
He let that girl blind him!

534
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,980
Chen Mo can be so fierce
when she's angry.

535
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,380
So scary!

536
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,140
Girls need to be

537
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,300
gentle.

538
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,620
You know nothing!

539
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:05,900
You…

540
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,060
Right, Chang Wuji?

541
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,640
- Am I right?
- Right.

542
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:10,900
Yes.

543
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:11,940
Good, Wuji.

544
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,100
Wuji, who do you think
is the most beautiful?

545
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:16,980
Qian Jiayue, I guess.

546
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,860
Wuji,

547
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,180
say it again.

548
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,380
Qian Jiayue.

549
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,060
I think I understand now.

550
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,540
You hang out

551
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,260
with the Juice Girls

552
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,020
just because of Qian Jiayue, huh?

553
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,540
I don't think so.

554
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,020
Ka Men asked me to do an experiment.

555
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,700
She asked me

556
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,820
if I was happier being with all of them,

557
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,300
or just being alone

558
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,620
with Qian Jiayue.

559
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,170
- And?
- What was the result?

560
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,980
We did the experiment a few times.

561
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,460
I found out I'm happier

562
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,020
when we're all together.

563
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,060
Something's off here.

564
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,100
There must be something off, Wuji.

565
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,540
You think

566
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,300
Qian Jiayue is the most beautiful,

567
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,300
but why don't you like

568
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,140
being alone with her?

569
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,260
When it's just me and Qian Jiayue,

570
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,340
she seems really uncomfortable.

571
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,460
She tries to talk

572
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,580
but doesn't know what to say.

573
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,350
But when Ka Men and Chen Mo are around,

574
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:28,540
she seems a lot more at ease.

575
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,500
So, I prefer being

576
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,780
with all of them.

577
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,980
So, you really care about
Qian Jiayue's feelings.

578
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:35,820
So selfless.

579
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,060
Wuji, let me ask you,

580
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,780
how do you exactly feel?

581
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,940
What's in your heart?

582
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,380
As long as she's happy, I'm happy.

583
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,700
The rest doesn't matter.

584
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,300
What's with that line?

585
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,500
Wang Bin, you should learn from him!

586
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,500
I can't learn that.

587
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,700
Look at his heart.

588
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,220
Oh my god, is this a scene
from a Chiung Yao drama?

589
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,620
Don't tell her anything!

590
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,380
Or she'll get
uncomfortable again.

591
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,780
"I'm uncomfortable again!"

592
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,780
(Jiale Wontons)

593
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,620
Aiping!

594
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,060
I got my hands on the secret manual

595
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,000
of Huang Yaoshi for you.

596
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,650
- Aiping?
- Not here.

597
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,460
Didn't she go to look for you?

598
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,220
Look for me?

599
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,620
No.

600
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,380
She was here holding flowers,

601
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,740
saying she was heading to Longhua.

602
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,730
Didn't you two plan to meet there to dance?

603
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,260
Who would plan a date at Longhua?

604
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,820
To dance cha-cha at a cemetery?

605
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,860
Come on.

606
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,500
Longhua Martyrs' Cemetery?

607
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,020
Xiao Youguang?

608
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,020
I'll leave now.

609
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,540
When Aiping comes back,

610
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,140
- tell her I came by.
- Sure.

611
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:04,940
Hospital?

612
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,180
Got it.

613
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,540
I'll head over now.

614
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,780
You're going out again?

615
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,100
A social gathering.

616
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,460
There are so many of those lately.

617
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,140
By the way, dear,
I forgot to mention earlier.

618
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,380
Yesterday,

619
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,840
Zhang came with me to check out

620
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,340
the new factory site in the suburbs.

621
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,780
The environment is great,

622
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,020
better than we expected.

623
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,740
Also,

624
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,620
Secretary Peng

625
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,060
wants to have a talk with me,

626
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,300
and he'll also have a word
with my family.

627
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,390
Prepare yourself mentally for that.

628
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,460
If you can't bear him going,

629
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,700
just tell him directly.

630
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,130
So what if it's for work?

631
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,020
This is about family!

632
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,540
What's a husband?

633
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,780
A husband is supposed to be close to you.

634
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,100
Right?

635
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:13,100
Before he goes far away,

636
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,460
he should consider your feelings.

637
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,380
Chen!

638
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,220
Can you not go?

639
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,460
I mean...

640
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,140
is it possible
to not go for this transfer?

641
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,780
Not go?

642
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,800
Why would I pass up
such a good opportunity?

643
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,780
Look, you're

644
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,140
not as young as before.

645
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,940
Your heart and blood lipid levels

646
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,860
aren't looking great.

647
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:46,740
You'll be working

648
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,060
day and night in that fieldwork.

649
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,060
I'm really worried about your health.

650
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:52,860
Dear,

651
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,140
I'm fully aware

652
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,460
of my health.

653
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,220
Nothing to worry about.

654
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,140
Trust me.

655
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,140
But...

656
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,380
But...

657
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,860
this is Momo's most crucial year

658
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,740
before the college entrance exam.

659
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,060
I just want us

660
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,740
to be together as a family.

661
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,220
I've thought it through already.

662
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,980
I investigated there.

663
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:19,340
The girls' school there is really good.

664
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,680
As for your job issue,

665
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,820
I've also thought it through.

666
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:26,540
There's a Grade Ⅱ hospital nearby.

667
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,620
The only downside is that

668
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,700
the salary

669
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,780
might be a little lower.

670
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:33,860
But

671
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,460
it's close to home,

672
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,220
which means you'll have more time

673
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,380
to take care of our home,

674
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,500
me, and Momo.

675
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,380
But why didn't you

676
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,700
talk this over with us
before making decisions?

677
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,060
Talk it over?

678
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,620
What's there to talk about?

679
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,460
I'm the head of the family.

680
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,100
Isn't that good enough
I've sorted these all out?

681
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,620
Chen!

682
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,100
Over the years,

683
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,620
you've transferred jobs so much,

684
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,100
and we've moved around so many times.

685
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,060
Momo has had to
change schools every time!

686
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,020
She's told me more than once

687
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,140
that she hasn't

688
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,980
had a friend who stayed

689
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,060
more than two years!

690
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,460
Children need

691
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,500
a stable environment to grow!

692
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,380
I just want our family to...

693
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,220
Enough!

694
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,860
What's all this complaining about?

695
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,620
Haven't I been working hard?

696
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,220
Don't want to go, right?

697
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,780
Fine,

698
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:30,700
I'll go alone.

699
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,380
Chen!

700
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,620
Momo's taking College Entrance Exam soon.

701
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,030
What if she ends up in another city?

702
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,100
Don't you want us

703
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,710
to spend this year together

704
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,540
as a family?

705
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,580
With her grades,
can she even get into another city?

706
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,740
If she gets into
a second-tier school in Shanghai,

707
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,100
I'll be grateful.

708
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,260
Why are you always

709
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,740
making decisions on your own?

710
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:57,820
You never think about

711
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,140
how Momo or I feel!

712
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,900
(Answer? Zhao Gang)

713
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,380
Chen,

714
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,100
has a friend of yours

715
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,140
been hospitalized?

716
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,340
Have you eaten yet?

717
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,380
Not yet.

718
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,140
Let's

719
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,340
grab a bite together

720
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,620
once I'm done at the hospital.

721
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,420
Sure.

722
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,380
Where should we go?

723
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:26,940
You choose.

724
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,840
Water sample 1, right?

725
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,780
- Take it slow.
- Put on another label.

726
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,700
It's already enough.

727
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,060
Wait. We need to take samples
from two spots.

728
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,180
Water sample 1.

729
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,140
Alright, sample 1.

730
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,540
Hello, sir.

731
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,860
We're students
from Puyang No. 2 Middle School.

732
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,380
Could we interview you?

733
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,580
Sure. Go ahead.

734
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,460
- Great!
- Let's go.

735
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,340
For us,

736
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,140
it's the same every day.

737
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,580
Once the sun comes up,

738
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:04,740
we get to work.

739
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,700
Sometimes it's a long way.

740
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,780
Sometimes it's nearby.

741
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,220
- That's enough.
- Let's go.

742
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,100
- Let's head over there!
- Come on.

743
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,140
Qian Jiayue.

744
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,540
Come on. See you, guys!

745
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,270
- Bye!
- Thanks!

746
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,140
See you later.

747
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,300
I'm not familiar with

748
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,260
fancy places.

749
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,040
This is a small restaurant.
I hope it's okay.

750
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,460
Of course, it's okay.

751
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,140
Sir, is this table available?

752
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,390
- Of course!
- Great, this one.

753
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,500
When we were

754
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,460
working on the construction site,

755
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,380
we'd eat box lunches on the side of the road.

756
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,540
This place is really nice.

757
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,740
It's clean

758
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,860
and affordable.

759
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,140
My friend once brought me here.

760
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,300
Okay, okay.

761
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,300
Got it, I got it.

762
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,300
It's no trouble.

763
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,340
Speak of the devil!

764
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,620
Qiming!

765
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,060
Kang? What a coincidence!

766
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,260
Are you here with a friend?

767
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,500
Yes, I come here with a friend.

768
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,780
Mr. Chen!

769
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,180
Mr. Zhang.

770
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,060
You two know each other?

771
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,220
Mr. Chen is one of my regulars.

772
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,540
His driver took days off,
so I've been driving him around.

773
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,780
We've become friends that way.

774
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,740
What a coincidence!

775
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,340
You didn't know?

776
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:10,780
Know what?

777
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,340
Your wives and children

778
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,500
are close friends!

779
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,540
Qian Jiayue's dad!

780
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,380
Chen Mo's dad!

781
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,340
Chen Mo's dad?

782
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,580
Qian Jiayue's dad!

783
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,980
- What a coincidence!
- Unbelievable!

784
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,820
Your wives,

785
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,100
plus my Aiping,

786
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,460
are like sisters!

787
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,460
We definitely need to shake hands again!

788
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,020
Xiu'e!

789
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,220
What brings you here?

790
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,460
Pei asked me to bring you

791
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,300
some wontons.

792
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,820
She gave me so much again!

793
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,540
Come on in.

794
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,440
- I'll put these in the fridge.
- Sure.

795
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,340
Suit yourself.

796
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,780
When I called you,

797
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,620
you sounded really down.

798
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:52,860
So?

799
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,380
Are you upset?

800
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,620
Is it because Chen is being transferred?

801
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,140
Did you talk to him about it?

802
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,140
I did.

803
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,820
It doesn't work.

804
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,820
Saw it on your face.

805
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,660
I said everything,

806
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,660
but it didn't help.

807
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,540
Back then,

808
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,020
when Chen and I first fell in love,

809
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,540
he was in Xinjiang.

810
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,180
Waiting for his letter

811
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,540
was the highlight of my week.

812
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,140
I knew exactly where the postman

813
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,540
came from, how he got here,

814
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,380
and which path he took!

815
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,090
People around me all said

816
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,220
he wouldn't come back,

817
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:43,900
but I didn't care.

818
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,500
I would wait for him.

819
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,700
I waited, and I waited...

820
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,740
for four years.

821
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:55,100
Your eyes are shining.

822
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,220
Was he really that charming?

823
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,540
At that time, I just had one wish:

824
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,700
to be with him, no matter where,

825
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,420
even if it was in Xinjiang.

826
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:09,740
Later,

827
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,620
he finally got transferred
back to Shanghai.

828
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:12,780
But you know

829
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,300
how it goes...

830
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,580
Different Cities and districts...

831
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,540
He always got transferred.

832
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,340
Momo and I followed him,
changing houses and schools.

833
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,060
I promised him that

834
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,860
wherever he was,
that's where we would be.

835
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,060
But every time, he said,

836
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,660
"This is the last move.

837
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,980
Once we settle here,

838
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,820
it will be for good."

839
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,060
And yet,

840
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,220
look at us...

841
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,020
It's always the same!

842
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,180
Actually,

843
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,700
she used to be

844
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,620
so supportive of my work.

845
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:39,540
But this time,

846
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,700
I don't know what's going on.

847
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,220
No matter what I say,

848
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,220
she keeps opposing me.

849
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,060
She even said

850
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,420
I never think about her feelings.

851
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,100
What's up with that?

852
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,580
It's totally unreasonable.

853
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,540
What's so funny?

854
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,020
Chen.

855
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:58,980
Mr. Chen.

856
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,380
Your wife is just

857
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,540
being a little spoiled.

858
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,620
Spoiled? Spoiled?

859
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,660
You guys don't understand
the situation at all!

860
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,540
If you call that spoiled, then everything

861
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,140
would be so much easier.

862
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,300
Spoiling comes in many forms,

863
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,100
and complaining is one of them.

864
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,380
My wife

865
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,660
has a sharp tongue.

866
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,860
She complains all the time.

867
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:26,220
People say I'm afraid of her,

868
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,380
but I don't think so.

869
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,340
I actually feel proud

870
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,540
of her complaints.

871
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,980
It shows how much she cares.

872
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,140
I'm happy about that.

873
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:35,140
You're happy,

874
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,860
unlike me...

875
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:39,350
Qiming,

876
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,460
we were talking about Chen,

877
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,440
and now you've turned it into
something about you.

878
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,380
What happened?

879
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,460
It's a long story.

880
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,900
Go ahead, speak up.

881
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,060
Since you're here,
and you're more cultured,

882
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,540
maybe you can help me out.

883
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,900
I just can't figure out

884
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,540
what she meant.

885
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,420
Help me out here.

886
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,260
What is it?

887
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,460
A poem?

888
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,460
Sometimes I think, in this marriage,

889
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,980
from start to finish,

890
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,420
it's only me holding everything together.

891
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,660
Tell me,

892
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,180
what's the real point

893
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,900
for a woman to get married?

894
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,540
But Chen works so hard

895
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,150
for the family, doesn't he?

896
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,740
No, it's all for himself.

897
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:24,750
Xiu'e,

898
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,980
I envy you and Aiping

899
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,940
so much.

900
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:31,940
And Pei too.

901
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,820
She and Liu Songming

902
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,280
argue all the time, but at least

903
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,020
it shows they have some chemistry.

904
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,220
Not like me.

905
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,740
My home feels so cold.

906
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,660
When he gets angry,

907
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,740
I don't dare even to speak.

908
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,660
Come on, it's alright.

909
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:56,540
Men… you have to take it slow.

910
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:03,980
Even if you get angry,

911
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,260
you will still clean up.

912
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,860
I can't just sit around.

913
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,940
When I'm feeling down,

914
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,540
cleaning helps me feel better.

915
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,020
Good for you.

916
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,140
As for me, no matter my mood,

917
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,420
I always do housework.

918
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,060
Let me help you.

919
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,620
No, sit here. Leave it to me.

920
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,180
It's fine! I'm used to it.

921
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,020
Come on.

922
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,060
"Already lightly powdered"

923
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,920
means she stopped
wearing makeup long ago.

924
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,580
The second line,

925
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:28,980
"alone in an empty room",

926
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,030
I think I understand that.

927
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,980
It's about feeling lonely, right?

928
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,980
Am I right?

929
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:33,820
Yes, yes.

930
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:36,060
It means living alone in an empty room.

931
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:37,980
And

932
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,180
"wishing to resume a broken string

933
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,180
but cannot" means trying to fix

934
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,100
a broken string.

935
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,340
What it expresses is…

936
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,540
wishing to find someone to replace you,

937
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:50,540
but not being able to.

938
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,060
Got it?

939
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,620
Got it?

940
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,620
When you put it all together,

941
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,860
this poem

942
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,940
is about a woman's sorrow.

943
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,540
But back in ancient times,

944
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,740
male poets sometimes

945
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,220
used these kinds of women's lament poems

946
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:10,140
to express their own
frustrations with their careers

947
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:13,180
or their feelings of loneliness.

948
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,220
Got it?

949
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,540
Got it?

950
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:19,060
This was written by a woman.

951
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:21,820
Aiping wrote it?

952
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,260
Kang.

953
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,380
Mr. Chen.

954
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,020
I... I'm...

955
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:29,860
I'm not

956
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:30,860
expecting Guan Aiping

957
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,940
to forget Xiao Youguang right away.

958
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,140
That's not what I expect.

959
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:34,980
I can accept it.

960
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,940
We're both older now,

961
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,060
and we know everyone

962
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,220
has a past.

963
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,580
Honestly, it doesn't bother me.

964
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,540
She… "wishes to resume"…

965
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,060
She's actually looking for someone

966
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,020
to replace Xiao Youguang,
but she hasn't found

967
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,060
that person.

968
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,700
As for the "broken string"…

969
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,540
I'm not...

970
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,460
a musician.

971
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,300
I...

972
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,340
I can't even sing in tune…

973
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,180
I'm like a mute!

974
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,460
I'm nothing...

975
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:05,900
Why are you laughing?

976
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,980
I wasn't feeling great today,

977
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,580
but now I feel better.

978
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,380
Let's all be happy!

979
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:17,900
Oh, women…

980
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,540
A woman's heart is like

981
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,240
a needle in the ocean.

982
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,820
You two each take a drink.

983
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:26,940
Come on, have a drink.

984
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,820
Sir, can we get another bottle
of soft drink?

985
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,700
What's this?

986
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:55,940
No idea.

987
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:04,900
Look here.

988
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,540
A boy and a girl,

989
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,500
with some little hearts beside them.

990
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,120
Could Chen Mo be…

991
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:15,310
In love?

992
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,060
Fangfang! There's a box here!

993
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,340
A plane?

994
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,060
Why's it hidden?

995
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:42,660
Look!

996
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,460
"H-A-N,

997
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:53,140
I promised you a special gift.

998
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,580
I spent two weeks making it

999
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,900
by hand.

1000
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,380
How is it?

1001
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:01,940
Isn't it special?

1002
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,180
Happy birthday.

1003
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,830
Now, think about how you're going to

1004
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,020
repay me!

1005
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,940
I didn't expect that

1006
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,460
a sanctimonious

1007
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,060
hypocrite like you

1008
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,500
is actually not so bad."

1009
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,540
A hypocrite…

1010
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,620
it's probably a guy.

1011
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,820
It's a plane.

1012
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,700
It's also a plane.

1013
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,380
Everything fits.

1014
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,420
The girl in the drawing

1015
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:38,820
is your daughter, Chen Mo,

1016
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,340
and the boy next to her is that...

1017
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,700
sanc... hypo...

1018
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:45,660
Sanctimonious hypocrite.
