23

=Episode 18=

24
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,170
Thankfully, my mom isn't
going to be a flight attendant.

25
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,460
Why did you change your mind?

26
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,620
I've thought about it.

27
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,940
My mom can't go.

28
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,260
If she gets selected,

29
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,500
she'll be flying all the time,

30
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,380
and I'll be alone with my dad at home.

31
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,100
That's so miserable.

32
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,940
That's right.

33
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,700
Qian Jiayue.

34
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,380
Chang Wuji.

35
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,500
Why are you here?

36
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,140
I'm here to buy buns.

37
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,460
You want buns?

38
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,140
Are the buns ready, Ms. Huang?

39
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,180
Almost ready.

40
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,780
Just a moment.

41
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:15,860
Okay.

42
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,100
- Wait a minute.
- Okay.

43
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,460
It's early in the morning.

44
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,460
They're working so hard

45
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,740
for the host

46
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,340
and flight attendant positions.

47
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,900
I don't think

48
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,700
Ka Men signed up for the host

49
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,860
for herself.

50
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,860
Then for what?

51
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,500
The host.

52
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,060
It's for Lu Yao.

53
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,300
Come on, Qing! You can do it.

54
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,340
Faster, come on.

55
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,540
(Yao)

56
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,260
Liu Wanqing,

57
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,280
still no clue about the solution?

58
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,260
Hey,

59
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,060
why are you writing the conclusion?

60
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,100
What about the reasons?

61
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,140
Well done!

62
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,500
Attention!

63
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,340
Great!

64
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,540
Fantastic!

65
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,140
Amazing!

66
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,460
Mom, your introduction

67
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,420
was really good,

68
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,700
but there's a tiny issue,

69
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,740
such as the stress on certain words.

70
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:49,940
I've marked them.

71
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,420
Besides, the pauses between sentences

72
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,500
can be a bit longer.

73
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,700
It makes you more composed.

74
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:56,940
Mr. Xiao Han,

75
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,260
don't be too strict with your mom.

76
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,940
Listen, she's excellent.

77
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,420
Only very few flight attendants

78
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,220
can outperform your mom.

79
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,540
You haven't seen the discs of

80
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,700
Chen Xiu'e and Pei.

81
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,740
They are hilarious.

82
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,300
You made discs for them too?

83
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,300
I made these discs

84
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,580
to make them know themselves clearly.

85
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,820
Isn't it silly? So silly.

86
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:24,900
She's so silly!

87
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,740
You lack solid basic skills.

88
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,140
So... So funny!

89
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,420
She's doing a comedy show, right?

90
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,860
I'm back.

91
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,100
Why are you laughing so hard?

92
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,300
What are you watching?

93
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,900
We're watching a comedy.

94
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,340
Comedy? Wang Xiaomao?

95
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,180
I also want to watch.

96
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,140
Let me see.

97
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,660
Where did you get this?

98
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,220
My dad

99
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,100
made a copy,

100
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,220
saying it could be a souvenir.

101
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,240
I'll clean the vegetables.

102
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,660
Don't block the TV.

103
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,940
You should think it through.

104
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,540
Do you think an airline

105
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,300
would hire someone like you?

106
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,220
Miss Chen.

107
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,400
Since you were young,
I've been telling you

108
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,620
when talking to others,

109
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,220
you need to look them in the eyes

110
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,060
sincerely, right?

111
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:17,900
What about you?

112
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,940
Whenever you speak,

113
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,420
you roll your eyes.

114
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,500
Besides,

115
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,340
I've been telling you

116
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,460
you must stand straight

117
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,100
and be confident when you walk.

118
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,740
Have you ever stood straight?

119
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,980
I haven't taught her well

120
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,100
since she was young.

121
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,580
It's my fault.

122
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,500
I am responsible.

123
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,620
That's right.

124
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,900
Whose fault is it?

125
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,260
Who raised me?

126
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,740
Who nurtured me?

127
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,180
It hasn't been easy

128
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,300
for me to grow up.

129
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,060
Now you're making fun of me.

130
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,340
We're just joking about it at home.

131
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,620
If one day,

132
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,220
everyone in Shanghai laughs at you,

133
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,220
you'll be so embarrassed.

134
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,900
I've seen the news.

135
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,220
The airline company

136
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,980
will only choose 18 people

137
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,380
among thousands of candidates.

138
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,060
Do you think your mom can get in?

139
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,700
Mao Tou, what do you think?

140
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,060
It's impossible.

141
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,460
She can't make it.

142
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,260
What's the point of doing this?

143
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,540
My sisters and I

144
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,020
agreed to have fun together.

145
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,420
What's wrong?

146
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,820
Listen,

147
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,060
your dear friend

148
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,900
Guan Aiping really should do it.

149
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,060
What about you?

150
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,620
Have you looked in the mirror

151
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,860
at the door

152
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,460
and examined yourself from head to toe?

153
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,300
Guan Aiping

154
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,660
- used to be...
- "Guan Aiping used to be

155
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,940
a March 8th Red Flag Bearer

156
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,300
and a role model worker.

157
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,620
She can do everything

158
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,780
and do it well.

159
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,340
Then look at yourself."

160
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,700
You've finally had self-awareness.

161
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,020
I always do.

162
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,820
I've looked in the mirror.

163
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,100
I think I look fine.

164
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,340
I can do it.

165
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,240
I'm very good.

166
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,340
Good, good, good.
Are you a hen that lays eggs?

167
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,060
What kind of English is that?

168
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,100
Very good.

169
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,460
Right?

170
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,340
God-grandma, you have a good accent.

171
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,740
Mom, stop criticizing her.

172
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,020
Xiu'e has worked hard.

173
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,500
She's been practicing
English and manners.

174
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,180
Are you serious?

175
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,100
She's been practicing,

176
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,460
and she ended up like this?

177
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,220
I'm so embarrassed.

178
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,060
I...

179
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,500
I'm not embarrassed.

180
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:23,340
I'm happy. I like it.

181
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,900
Come on, Mao Tou.

182
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,060
Let's practice.

183
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,190
Mao Tou, teach me!

184
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,740
Come back for dinner.

185
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,780
I'm already full!

186
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,620
Not dinner.

187
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,740
Hurry up.

188
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,660
Ridiculous, right?

189
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,860
Hurry, Mao Tou.

190
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,500
Godmother,

191
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,660
I think when you said

192
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,540
"very good",

193
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,300
the "very" was pronounced well.

194
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,700
The "very" was really good.

195
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:09,860
What does it mean?

196
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,740
It means our method worked.

197
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,620
Let's keep learning today.

198
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,740
Look at this sentence.

199
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,260
Please fasten your seatbelt.

200
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:34,260
Please fa... Please...

201
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,940
I think we should learn

202
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,260
the next one, life vest.

203
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,460
Life vest.

204
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,140
Life vest.

205
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,780
How can you memorize "vest" more easily?

206
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,860
Vest, vest, vest...

207
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,820
Annoying.
[*Pronounced similarly]

208
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,860
Is "annoying" easier to memorize?

209
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,740
Annoying.

210
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,060
I'll write it down, Godmother.

211
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,740
Annoying.

212
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,020
I'm so smart.

213
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,700
Mao Tou.

214
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,140
Let's call it a day.

215
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,740
The High School Entrance Exam
is coming up.

216
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,140
Thank you.

217
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,460
Mao Tou.

218
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:16,980
You...

219
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,220
You're very good.

220
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:20,940
Thank you.

221
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,860
Actually, my mom was right.

222
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,860
Well, my face...

223
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,820
It doesn't look like

224
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,140
a flight attendant's face.

225
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,020
Enough. Stop looking.

226
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,620
Anyway,

227
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,420
you look more like it than I do.

228
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,660
When I was going through my wardrobe,

229
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,420
I couldn't even

230
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,820
find a fancy dress

231
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,820
for the interview.

232
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,380
I even went crazy and bought...

233
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,220
I'll never wear these in my life.

234
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,740
They look so bulky. It's ridiculous.

235
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,140
Why did we agree

236
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,460
to be flight attendants with Aiping?

237
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,380
Was I out of my mind

238
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,660
at that moment?

239
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,500
I never agreed.

240
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,620
Did you agree?

241
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,300
You didn't agree either.

242
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,700
The 16-year-old Chen Xiu'e

243
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,140
and Pei said yes.

244
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,540
Unfortunately,

245
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,100
we're not 16 years old anymore.

246
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,460
Granny.

247
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,220
Aiping.

248
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,780
Aiping,

249
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,380
I really didn't mean

250
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,460
to oppose this matter.

251
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,700
You must've heard the saying,

252
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,420
"The bolder,

253
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,740
the more productive."

254
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,020
However, it's been proven

255
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,460
to be wrong.

256
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,500
Only very few people

257
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,820
can be flight attendants.

258
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,180
Not everyone can make it.

259
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,980
Can Chen Xiu'e make it?

260
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,460
No way.

261
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,380
Yes, I scolded her at home.

262
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,620
However,

263
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,020
if she really fails,

264
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,460
she'll be more upset.

265
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,220
I know

266
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,220
you're doing this for her.

267
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,380
Actually,

268
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,100
you don't need to worry so much.

269
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,820
This time is not just

270
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,660
for the flight attendant position.

271
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,420
Then why do you...?

272
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,300
Since the beginning, we've known

273
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,460
it's nearly impossible

274
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,780
to get in.

275
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,940
Then we'll do it now.

276
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,340
I'm not scared.

277
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,220
- Okay.
- Okay.

278
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,900
Flight attendants?

279
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,220
I'm so impressed.

280
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,740
You two really agreed.

281
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,220
Well, she said she'd do it.

282
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,420
I can't be a coward, right?

283
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,580
What? I didn't mean it.

284
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,780
Bragging isn't a crime, right?

285
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,210
The entire Shanghai
only hires 18 people.

286
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,620
They need to be pretty,

287
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,020
well-educated,

288
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,540
and fluent in English.

289
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,740
Do you really think

290
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,620
I can get in?

291
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,100
That's ridiculous.

292
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,660
With my figure,

293
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,780
it's hard for me to move

294
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,420
in the airplane aisle.

295
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,820
I can't get in either.

296
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,140
Honestly,

297
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,340
I don't think

298
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,620
I can get in either.

299
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,100
When I returned to the factory today,

300
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,540
I thought about our youth.

301
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,540
Although

302
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,380
the factory is gone,

303
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,300
those memories remain.

304
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,540
I really don't want us

305
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,340
to find these years all blank

306
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,580
when we look back

307
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,260
in our late years.

308
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,380
So,

309
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,700
maybe we should do it.

310
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,860
Whether we pass it or not,

311
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,340
at least we've tried.

312
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,660
When we look back,

313
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,540
these days will be so good.

314
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,700
For...

315
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,740
our good memories.

316
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,340
Then let's...

317
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,460
Sign up.

318
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,020
- Okay?
- Okay!

319
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:01,940
Do it!

320
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:02,890
Sign up!

321
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:05,900
Chairwoman Liao,

322
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,260
we're not daydreaming

323
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,900
or fantasizing.

324
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,140
We just want to find

325
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,940
a little joy

326
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,940
in our ordinary lives.

327
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,300
I knew you'd be here.

328
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,700
Aiping.

329
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,100
What's wrong?

330
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,940
Pei and I talked about...

331
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,380
becoming a flight attendant...

332
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,100
Right?

333
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,860
I know what you're thinking.

334
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,900
I won't force you.

335
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,340
To be honest, being a flight attendant

336
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,500
is not our real purpose, right?

337
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,340
However...

338
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,260
the mock interview has been arranged,

339
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:25,420
and the community's activity room
is ready.

340
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,020
Why don't we

341
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,780
give it a try?

342
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,380
Pei.

343
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,500
Are you ready? Hurry up!

344
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:44,980
Coming.

345
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,100
Ms. Huang, I'll be right back!

346
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,500
You look really good.

347
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,340
Good?

348
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,140
I haven't worn this for so long.

349
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,340
I can hardly walk in this.

350
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,270
Turn around. Let me see.

351
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,220
It's good, but keep your back straight

352
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,740
as we practiced.

353
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:01,780
Okay, okay.

354
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,140
Let me try.

355
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,340
Me name is Chen Xiu'e.

356
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,140
It's not correct.

357
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,100
Given name first,

358
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,660
surname second.

359
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,340
Xiu'e Chen.

360
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,900
Me name is Xiu'e Chen.

361
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,060
What about your name?

362
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,420
My name is Pei.

363
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,820
I can't use Pei.

364
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,620
My name is Shuangpei Wang.

365
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,180
It sounds like sausage.

366
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,140
It's Shuangpei!

367
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:28,980
Shuanghui sausage...

368
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,180
Welcome aboard.

369
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,020
You need to extend the "o" sound.

370
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,260
Like "bo"...

371
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,300
Welcome aboard.

372
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,620
Here they are.

373
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,460
Isn't it a mock interview?

374
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,740
Why is everyone here?

375
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,660
Exactly.

376
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,570
Aiping.

377
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,020
Ms. Stewardess,

378
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,900
my suitcase is too large

379
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,740
to fit in.

380
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,100
Can you help me?

381
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,000
This way, please.

382
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,340
Welcome aboard.

383
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,300
Hello.

384
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,940
Even Director Dong is here.

385
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,740
Chairwoman Liao said

386
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,300
we should take it more seriously.

387
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,780
She invited all these people.

388
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,420
We just want to find

389
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,020
a little joy

390
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,940
in our ordinary lives.

391
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,430
If we want to do it,

392
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,690
do it properly.

393
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,660
Such a big suitcase

394
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,900
can't get on the plane.

395
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,740
Exactly.

396
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,180
Hold it up.

397
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:31,860
I'll help them.

398
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,380
Let me help you.

399
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,220
Thank you.

400
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,140
Can I put it here?

401
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:36,980
Have a seat.

402
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:37,850
Look good, right?

403
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,420
Ladies and gentlemen,

404
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,140
welcome aboard.

405
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,180
Ladies and gentlemen,

406
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,820
welcome aboard.

407
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,700
I am your flight attendant today.

408
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,700
Now, we'll demonstrate

409
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,740
the safety instructions.

410
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,140
During the flight,

411
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,780
please fasten your seatbelt.

412
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,860
We might encounter

413
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,980
some turbulence when the plane
takes off, lands, or flies.

414
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,460
When the "fasten seatbelt" sign
lights up,

415
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,100
please fasten your seatbelt.

416
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,220
Oxygen masks

417
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,260
are placed above your seat.

418
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,860
When you demonstrate it,

419
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,360
you only need to plug it in.

420
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,060
Why are you fastening it
on yourself?

421
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,180
It will drop automatically...

422
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,860
It's inappropriate.

423
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,820
Qing, help me unlock it.

424
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,300
It's getting tighter.

425
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,620
It's tighter, Qing.

426
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,140
Well, this...

427
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,380
- button.
- Take it off.

428
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,900
Passengers, please be seated.

429
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,420
There's a slight issue with the demo.

430
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,260
The buckle...

431
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,380
This...

432
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,020
It's off, finally.

433
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,700
Tighten it for safety.

434
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,540
Safety first.

435
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,060
What?

436
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,060
Wait for the next cart.

437
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,220
Hello, sir.

438
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,700
What would you like?

439
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:05,940
I'll wait

440
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,380
for that stewardess.

441
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,340
Zhang Qiming, look at you.

442
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,540
You...

443
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,300
You can't treat
your passengers like this.

444
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,620
Hello, sir,

445
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,940
what would you like?

446
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,340
Salted soda, please.

447
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,500
We don't have salted soda.

448
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,780
Then I'll have a cup of

449
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,020
Cola Cao.

450
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,580
We don't have Cola Cao.

451
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,420
Look,

452
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,380
we have orange juice.

453
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,500
You have nothing.

454
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,460
No...

455
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:28,940
No Cola Cao...

456
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,140
Are you from the northeast?

457
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,980
My ancestors were from there.

458
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,820
Shenyang.

459
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,780
Oh my god. My grandpa is from Sujiatun.

460
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,900
Oh my god. I'm from Santaizi.
Can you believe it?

461
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,140
I often went there...

462
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:42,980
Sit down.

463
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,060
- Sorry.
- Seatbelt.

464
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,020
Okay.

465
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,390
- What would you like?
- Don't give him a can.

466
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,430
Pour him a little.

467
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,860
Xiu'e, look.

468
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,980
We're playing

469
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,380
foreign tourists.

470
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,700
She's an overseas Chinese.

471
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,260
Is your

472
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,460
English okay?

473
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,300
No problem.

474
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,380
Come on.

475
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,020
No problem.

476
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,060
We have

477
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,580
apple juice...

478
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,630
Granny...
[*homophone]

479
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,740
Orange Juice...

480
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,540
Watermelon juice...

481
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,500
Sparkling water...

482
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,780
And...

483
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,700
Hot tea.

484
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,100
Okay.

485
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,940
Well,

486
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,780
Xiu'e.

487
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,260
The English you spoke...

488
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,940
I seem to understand,

489
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,260
yet I don't fully understand.

490
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,140
I'm a beginner.

491
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,580
- Wait, you...
- It's quite impressive for her

492
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,540
to speak like this.

493
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:38,940
- It's good.
- Good.

494
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,180
Very good.

495
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,700
Excellent.

496
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,420
Then I'd like some

497
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,020
orange

498
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,020
juice.

499
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,060
Here you are.

500
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,140
Thank you.

501
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,260
It's good.

502
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,540
Anything

503
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:56,940
drink?

504
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,820
Hot

505
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,140
tea.

506
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:07,900
Thank you.

507
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,900
I should

508
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,500
thank you.

509
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,820
Take your belongings.

510
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,500
- Have a nice day.
- Thank you.

511
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,100
Very good. Excellent.

512
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,140
Hope to see you again.

513
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:27,980
Good.

514
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,140
Good job.

515
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,100
This is more tiring

516
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,860
than a day at the counter.

517
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,340
Have you finished?

518
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,100
Fangfang, you missed the flight.

519
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,340
Sorry, I'm late.

520
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,500
You missed the whole thing.

521
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,540
It was amazing.

522
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,580
Really?

523
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,740
Where's your dad?

524
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:56,900
He went dancing.

525
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,860
Look what I've prepared for you.

526
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,740
This is for you.

527
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,300
- For me?
- Cheongsam?

528
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,220
Yes.

529
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,090
Aiping said you didn't know what to wear

530
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:06,980
for the interview.

531
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,380
I happened to know

532
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,220
a great tailor,

533
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,740
so I customized these for you.

534
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:11,900
This one is yours.

535
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,020
Take a look.

536
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,420
- So good.
- Different color.

537
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,660
How did you know our sizes?

538
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,740
Aiping told me.

539
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,100
Aiping said cheongsam

540
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,780
had a good meaning of victory.

541
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,860
Look, I made a set for myself too.

542
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,100
I'll wear it

543
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,620
and go to the interview with you,

544
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,860
- okay?
- Okay!

545
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,060
Aiping,

546
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,100
you've done so much for us secretly.

547
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,420
Fangfang is more thoughtful.

548
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,820
I only wanted to ask her

549
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,180
where I could buy those clothes.

550
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,740
See? She bought fabric

551
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,400
and hired a tailor
to make dresses for us.

552
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,260
As long as you like it.

553
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,420
We do.

554
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,380
Fangfang.

555
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,620
Thank you!

556
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,020
You're hugging too tightly.

557
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,060
You're hurting her.

558
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,300
Look how happy Pei is.

559
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,020
It's because I've never worn

560
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,820
a cheongsam before.

561
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:00,980
No matter what,

562
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,020
I have to put it on,

563
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:02,860
okay?

564
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,660
- Look good?
- Come on.

565
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,100
Let's come back to reality.

566
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,780
Put the cheongsams aside for now.

567
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,820
Let's take a photo

568
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,700
with our family

569
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,700
on this plane, okay?

570
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,580
- Okay.
- Come on. Let's take a photo.

571
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,740
Take a photo on the plane.

572
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,580
You're absent-minded.

573
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,580
Move faster!

574
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,300
Little girl.

575
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:19,340
Your mom gave them

576
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,420
three cheongsams.

577
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,220
Come on. You must stand in the middle.

578
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,580
Come on. Come here!

579
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,300
Hurry up!

580
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,260
I'll take the photo.

581
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,940
Mao Tou, join them.

582
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,540
I'll take the photo.

583
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,820
Stand next to your brother.

584
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:40,740
- Come on.
- Okay.

585
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,580
Hurry up.

586
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,470
Are you ready?

587
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,820
Three, two, one.

588
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,660
- Bye.
- We'll go to Chen Mo's place.

589
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,700
Go ahead.

590
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,100
Goodbye.

591
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,180
Be safe on the road.

592
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,030
- Thanks.
- Bye.

593
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,900
- Thanks.
- Bye, see you.

594
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,500
Coming.

595
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,180
I'll give you the photos.

596
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,700
Make sure to develop them, okay?

597
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,220
It's different from before.

598
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,580
Clap your hands.

599
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,180
The sound is so crisp.

600
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:27,100
(Jiale Wontons)

601
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,500
It's over?

602
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,020
I wanted to come back today,

603
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,940
but I was stuck in traffic.

604
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,500
Did you buy this?

605
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,540
Fangfang gave it to me.

606
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:02,900
The cheongsam

607
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,340
looks better than sweatpants.

608
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,100
But do you have to wear
such a tight dress?

609
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,220
People with a slim waist

610
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,100
can wear it with nice curves.

611
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,620
I think you should show your strengths.

612
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,020
This tight dress

613
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,100
makes you look fat.

614
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,460
People with a slim waist

615
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,340
can wear it with nice curves.

616
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,140
I got hungry after dancing.

617
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,420
Show my strengths?

618
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,020
You only see my flaws.

619
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,260
Do I have strengths?

620
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,220
What else should I wear?

621
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,120
Will you buy it for me?

622
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,900
I don't know if you were dancing

623
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,900
or doing something else.

624
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,380
What did I do?

625
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,020
I didn't do anything wrong.

626
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,780
Your words

627
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,140
are so harsh.

628
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,980
You want to be a flight attendant.

629
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,040
It's the service industry.

630
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,660
You need to speak gently.

631
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,780
You want me to be gentle?

632
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,180
I get up at 4 AM every morning.

633
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,220
I'm always busy with work.

634
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,580
I'm really exhausted.

635
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,340
You want me to be gentle?

636
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:23,860
What about you?

637
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,420
All these years,

638
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,300
you go out dancing every day.

639
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,220
Have you ever said,

640
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,140
"Honey, thank you"?

641
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:34,980
Have you?

642
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,940
Look at Chen Pengyu

643
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,780
and Zhang Qiming.

644
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,020
They have money.

645
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,620
They buy all kinds of things

646
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,780
for their wives.

647
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,340
Fine.

648
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,060
Forget about the rich ones.

649
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,140
What about Qian Kang?

650
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,780
Qian Kang immediately
goes home after work,

651
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,720
making Chen Xiu'e

652
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,180
happy every day.

653
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,700
Have you done any of these?

654
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,140
Am I not gentle enough?

655
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,220
Then find someone gentler!

656
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,620
I've had enough.

657
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,380
You're like a ghost.

658
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,620
What are you doing?

659
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,620
You're always criticizing Mom.

660
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,220
What's wrong with that?

661
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,500
(Class 5, Grade 10)

662
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,300
Let's go to Xidian Mall.

663
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,300
It's been a long time.

664
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,180
I have a school journal meeting.

665
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,420
What about Ka Men?

666
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,300
I can't go.

667
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,260
Why?

668
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,100
I've been on a diet for two days.

669
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,220
I'm worried that I'll lose control.

670
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,980
I want sausage and milk tea.

671
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,780
Have you lost any weight?

672
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,540
That's right.
Did you sign up for the host?

673
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,340
Not yet.

674
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,620
I've only lost 1.5 kilograms.

675
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,820
I won't sign up

676
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,420
unless I lose 5 kilograms.

677
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,060
Ka Men,

678
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,860
maybe you should stop.

679
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,140
I think you look great now.

680
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,260
You should learn from my mom.

681
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,700
No matter what happens,

682
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,340
she's always confident and energetic.

683
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:22,380
Since the mock interview,

684
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,100
she's been so excited.

685
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:26,380
She reads English
in the bathroom every morning.

686
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:27,900
Blah, blah, blah...

687
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,880
It's like ten Mao Tous

688
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,090
reading beside me.

689
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,780
I'm so sick of English right now.

690
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,740
How are you doing, Juice Girls?

691
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,570
Speak of the devil.

692
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:38,940
- Another English speaker.
- Fine.

693
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,780
Ka Men,

694
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,340
are you going to

695
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,420
sign up for the host?

696
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,220
Yes, I will.

697
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:47,940
That's great.

698
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,020
Maybe we should team up.

699
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,260
They said we needed

700
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,220
to find a partner.

701
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,780
What do you think?

702
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,220
Nice.

703
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,460
Do you have time now?

704
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,700
Let's go sign up.

705
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:05,940
Why not?

706
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:06,860
Let's go.

707
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,340
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

708
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,380
We're leaving.

709
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,620
I'll go to the meeting.

710
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,620
Why not?

711
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:21,980
Let's go.

712
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,940
This is unbelievable!

713
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,620
You're either

714
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,580
occupied by work

715
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,420
or busy with dating.

716
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,060
- Mao Tou!
- Godmother.

717
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,460
Why didn't you bring an umbrella?

718
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,420
Is Sister Jiayue back?

719
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,700
Not yet.

720
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,380
Great.

721
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,920
- I'll bring her an umbrella.
- Wait.

722
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:26,820
Don't worry about it.

723
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,940
She brought a raincoat.

724
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:30,940
She did?

725
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,300
It's raining now.

726
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,580
I don't have an umbrella or a raincoat.

727
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,140
I'm in a rush to my aunt's place.

728
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,620
What should I do now?

729
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,500
Use mine.

730
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,500
I have a raincoat.

731
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,500
What about you?

732
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,460
Don't worry.

733
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,940
I'll leave when it lets up.

734
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,620
I'm not in a hurry.

735
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,780
Alright then.

736
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,060
I'll return it to you tomorrow.

737
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,660
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

738
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:54,140
- Bye.
- Bye, take care.

739
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,340
Qian Jiayue?

740
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,260
Chang Wuji?

741
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,180
My home is over there.

742
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,020
Godmother, what happened?

743
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:12,060
Experience will be the ambush
of future surprises.

744
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,580
Mountain has its peak,

745
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:17,220
and lake has its other shore.

746
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,140
In the long journey of life,

747
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,220
everything has...

748
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,740
You can have some water.

749
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,580
Class 1 is quite impressive.

750
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,740
Zhao Tingting.

751
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,340
Her elegance

752
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,460
and aura.

753
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,140
She's an ice queen.

754
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,380
And Xiao Han.

755
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,020
When they stand together,

756
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,260
they're a perfect couple.

757
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,660
Other classes don't stand a chance.

758
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,740
That's not for sure.

759
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,500
Xiao Han is unlucky.

760
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:47,780
He's got a severe cold.

761
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,620
I doubt it.

762
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,380
A severe cold?

763
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,860
Got caught in the rain.

764
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,780
I don't know what happened.

765
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,020
Xiao Han

766
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:02,860
is usually cautious.

767
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,180
He didn't bring a raincoat or umbrella.

768
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,220
What happened?

769
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,460
But I believe,

770
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,740
even if he's seriously ill,

771
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,020
he'll definitely make it.

772
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:13,820
Qian Jiayue.

773
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,660
Are you in Class 1

774
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,580
or Class 5?

775
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,040
How can you defend outsiders

776
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,220
and undermine our confidence?

777
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,260
Besides, maybe they're strong,

778
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,740
but our class is also impressive,

779
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,780
and we have

780
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,780
Lu Yao.

781
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,500
With Lu Yao fighting for us,

782
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,020
there's nothing to worry about.

783
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,460
But his partner...

784
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,900
Liu Jianfeng, what do you mean?

785
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,620
Well, I...

786
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,420
He's just being honest.

787
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,740
Our high school

788
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,220
has so many outstanding people.

789
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,980
Our Ka Men

790
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,460
is very adorable,

791
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,340
but in certain aspects,

792
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,300
she's not that outstanding.

793
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,780
Yes, that's what I meant.

794
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,820
Ka Men's strength
is her good personality.

795
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,820
She doesn't get mad at jokes, right?

796
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,300
Yes.

797
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,700
Why do you call her Ka Men?

798
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,540
I remember you've called her that

799
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,380
since school started.

800
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:11,860
Qing,

801
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,060
hurry up.

802
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,500
Coming!

803
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,140
You can't get through it?

804
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,780
Are you Ka Men?

805
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,900
Ka Men?

806
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,340
What a perfect name.

807
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:25,980
Come on. Come in.

808
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:27,540
Ka Men, Ka Men.

809
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,940
That's an interesting name.

810
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,740
Stuck at the door.

811
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,580
So boring.

812
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,180
From now on,

813
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,180
what should we do?

814
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,540
Should we call her Ka Men?

815
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,340
She doesn't mind it now.

816
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,860
Back in middle school,

817
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,420
she insisted I call her Carmen.

818
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,860
As is said in Modern Music Field,

819
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,140
"Life is

820
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,300
all about

821
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,060
being laughed at

822
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,780
and sometimes laughing at others."

823
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,740
If I don't take it seriously,

824
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,740
they'll lose interest, right?

825
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,340
I've thought it through.

826
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,540
I'll give myself an English name.

827
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,180
It's also Carmen.
[*Carmen: Homophone]

828
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,580
So when they call me Ka Men,

829
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:07,220
I'll think of it as my English name.

830
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,460
My name is Liu Wanqing,

831
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,420
but you can call me Carmen.

832
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,420
Confucius, an ancient Chinese sage,

833
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,500
once said,

834
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,180
"Is it not delightful to have

835
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,300
friends coming from afar?"

836
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:22,220
Confucius, an ancient Chinese sage,

837
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,300
once said,

838
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,820
"Is it not delightful after all

839
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,950
to have friends coming from afar?"

840
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,340
Today, we get together here

841
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,020
to welcome our guests,

842
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:34,060
our dear friends from Europe.

(Step by Step)

844
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:45,980
Lu Yao, Lu Yao!

845
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,200
Ka Men!

846
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,440
- How's it going?
- How was it?

847
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,220
Ka Men.

848
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,020
The hosts are...

849
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,820
It's okay.

850
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,160
Yes, it's okay.

851
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,070
- Yes, nothing to worry about.
- Not a big deal.

852
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,420
- It's us!
- It's us!

853
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,060
Really?

854
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,220
Drinks on me, everyone.

855
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,060
Okay.

856
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,340
- I'm in!
- Let's go.

857
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:14,880
Chivalry, please.
[*Chivalry: A brand]

858
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,940
- Thanks, sir.
- Thanks.

859
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:19,980
Let me do it.

860
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,660
- Here.
- Be careful.

861
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,340
Thanks, superstar.

862
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,540
You're welcome.

863
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:28,780
You!

864
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,740
Aren't you eating?

865
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:34,820
Not hungry.

866
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,780
Make some space.

867
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,180
Let's celebrate

868
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:44,020
for our success. Cheers!

869
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,140
(Shanghai Puyang No. 2 Middle School)

870
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,230
I found speaking English

871
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:48,620
on stage more stressful

872
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:50,380
than hosting a TV show.

873
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,070
Ka Men.

874
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,940
Can you help me with my English?

875
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,180
I know

876
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,260
the teacher chose me as the host

877
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,460
because I have experience,

878
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,940
but I still need to work on my English,

879
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,500
especially my pronunciation.

880
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,500
Is that okay?

881
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,660
No problem,

882
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:10,520
sure,

883
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,380
no sweat,

884
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,940
they all mean "yes".

885
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,660
I'll practice with you
after school every day.

886
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,740
Sure.

887
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:17,980
You're a true friend.

888
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,260
My bike is here.

889
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,100
How are you going home?

890
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,540
Let me give you a ride.

891
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,140
Did you ride a bike?

892
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,620
I usually do.

893
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,220
But today, my bike...

894
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,140
Well, I...

895
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,780
It's being repaired.

896
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,660
Alright, I'll give you a ride.

897
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,540
Let's go.

898
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:52,900
Let's go.

899
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,140
Sit tight.

900
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:32,700
Well,

901
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:33,910
you go ahead.

902
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,900
I'll just take the bus.

903
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:38,820
No need.

904
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,300
I just...

905
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,100
I didn't use much strength.

906
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,980
I'm ready now.

907
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:45,820
It's fine.

908
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,260
Your backpack is too heavy.

909
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,180
Put it in front, and it'll be fine.

910
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:51,820
Give it to me.

911
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:02,900
Sit tight.

912
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,060
See? We're good.

914
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,140
I've arrived.

915
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,420
Jiale Wontons.

916
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,260
This is my family's restaurant.

917
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,780
Would you like some wontons?

918
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:29,980
Maybe another day.

919
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,460
Thanks for today.

920
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,580
I really couldn't

921
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,660
make it up that hill.

922
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,140
Come on.

923
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,420
Let's celebrate our victory again.

924
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,500
Give me five.

925
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,540
See you tomorrow.

926
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,300
See you tomorrow.

927
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,220
See you tomorrow.

928
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:05,900
See you!

What are you looking at?

930
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:34,900
Where's your bike?

931
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,060
Left at school!

Xiao Han is unlucky.

935
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:10,660
He's got a severe cold.

936
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,190
He didn't bring a raincoat or umbrella.

937
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,260
Here's the medicine.

938
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:34,340
- Okay.
- Feeling any better?

939
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,060
My nose feels better.

940
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:40,180
My throat still hurts.

941
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,380
Still a slight fever.

942
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,060
Take the medicine now.

943
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,820
Chen Mo, why are you feeling guilty?

944
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,060
Your classmate is ill.

945
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,780
It's pretty normal to ask

946
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,300
if he's doing well.

Hello.

950
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:29,500
Hello?

951
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,060
Who is it?

952
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,300
No idea.

953
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,020
Probably the wrong number.
