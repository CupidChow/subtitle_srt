(Shanghai Puyang No. 2 Middle School)

25
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,240
How do you like today's tour?

26
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,110
Not bad.

27
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,500
It could've been worse.

28
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,180
What's wrong?

29
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,220
The Oriental Pearl Tower is great.

30
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,660
Jinmao is tall,
and the Bund is very beautiful.

31
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:57,940
I mean,

32
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,780
it was great for tourists,

33
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,820
but to me,

34
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,260
there's still something missing.

35
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,580
My grandparents
were originally from China.

36
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,260
I've always wanted to have

37
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,940
a full understanding of this country

38
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,020
and people here.

39
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,260
Normal people, daily life,

40
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,820
things like that.

41
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,100
That's what I expected.

42
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,780
I understand.

43
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:18,900
Yeah.

44
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,540
As you said,

45
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,220
I want something more than

46
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,780
correct answers on the textbooks.

47
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,980
Are you hungry?

48
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,820
Here we are.

(Jiale Wontons)
This way.

50
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,420
Uncle Qin, are you going out?

51
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,460
You're back.

52
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,820
This is my neighborhood.

53
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,500
Normal people, daily life,

54
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,900
what you've expected.

55
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,780
Look at this, Daniel.

56
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,460
Sorry.

57
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,980
This is where I live.

58
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,460
So, you live in a restaurant?

59
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,780
Kind of. Come here.

61
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,580
Welcome!

62
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,740
He finished it all,

63
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,900
including the soup.

64
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,860
Daniel, slow down.

65
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,300
Foreigners also love

66
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,580
- Chinese wontons.
- Exactly.

67
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,580
Of course, I made them.

68
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,260
Pei, ask him

69
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,660
if he wants more.

70
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,200
Me... Me?

71
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,660
Didn't you practice English

72
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,500
for the interview?

73
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,220
You can do it.

74
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,100
Okay. I'm not scared.

75
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,500
Xiu'e, Aiping,

76
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,940
come with me, okay?

77
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,820
Three, two, one.

78
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,340
Would you like something to drink, sir?

79
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,300
Oh, no.

80
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,580
We have apple juice,
orange juice, watermelon juice...

81
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,620
Yes, yes.

82
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,380
No apple juice, not that.

83
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,700
We don't have...

84
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,180
No.

85
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,900
We have Coca-Cola.

86
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,300
I got it.

87
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,780
Your English is so good.

88
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,420
- Very good.
- Pei!

- Fangfang.

112
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,100
Yeah.

113
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,100
My grandma has a dress like that.

114
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,140
Really.

115
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,820
You all look beautiful. Very beautiful.

116
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,500
He said you're all beautiful.

117
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,740
Thank you, thank you.

118
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,580
And his grandma has a cheongsam

119
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,900
like this.

120
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,380
No need to translate.
We understand, right?

121
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,660
English good.

La, la, la,

123
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,380
I'm a little expert at selling newspapers.

124
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,140
Mr. Zhang has bought

125
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,700
all the newspapers.

126
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,060
So many!

00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,620
Zhang Qiming!

128
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,780
The more you buy,

129
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,860
the fewer people will know.

130
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,900
Why did you buy them all?

131
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,620
It's fine. I'll deliver them.

132
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,940
I'll deliver them

133
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,940
to whomever you wish to show them to.

134
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,380
Okay!

135
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,660
Hand me a stack.

136
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,140
I'll take Daniel to the New Village

137
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,420
and give them out to everyone.

138
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,900
Don't just take one stack.

139
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,770
Take more.

140
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,620
Come on, Qing.

141
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,900
Take them all.

142
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,460
I'll take you out.

143
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,140
Okay, go.

144
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,140
Go!

145
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,100
Should we ask Mao Tou
to bring the camera?

146
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,140
I'll give him a call.

147
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,460
He'll bring the camera here.

148
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,540
Let everyone know about it.

149
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,930
It's my first time in the newspaper.

150
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,100
Your names are also on it.

151
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,900
- Guan Aiping.
- Wang Shuangpei.

152
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,620
Chen Xiu'e, Chen Xiu'e!

153
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,060
We didn't become flight attendants,

154
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,100
but

155
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,380
now we're on the front page.

156
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,620
Isn't it great?

157
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,540
Yeah, indeed.

158
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,380
It's hard to become

159
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,380
a flight attendant.

160
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,860
It's even harder to be on
Xinmin Evening News!

161
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,700
Of course.

162
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,100
It's even on the front page!

163
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,500
Yes, I must show this to Chen.

164
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,980
He must see this!

165
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,340
Take more back.

166
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,180
Look at my style.

167
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,180
I can pose like this forever.

168
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,340
Put them up on the wall.

169
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:24,820
Okay, listen.

170
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,740
- Put them up.
- Get a big frame.

171
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,180
It'll be amazing!

172
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,500
Never mind.

173
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,180
There's no need for that.

174
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,060
No need for that?

175
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,340
Put it up on the door.

176
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,060
Yes, put it up, Pei.

177
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,020
Now

178
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,740
everyone's here, right?

179
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,700
I...

180
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,180
I have an announcement.

181
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:56,860
I discussed it

182
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,580
with Liu Songming.

183
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,420
We decided

184
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,100
to close the restaurant.

185
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,700
Close it?

186
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,740
Pei already told me.

187
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,660
Why, Pei?

188
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,300
What?

189
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,060
It's been so many years.

190
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,460
Are you really going to close it?

191
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,700
Do we have a choice?

192
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,900
Ever since Food Republic opened,

193
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,580
our wontons

194
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,300
have really become outdated.

195
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,700
Outdated?

196
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,580
No. In that case,

197
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,020
if we want to have a chat,

198
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:39,980
where should we go then?

199
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,460
If it rains heavily,

200
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,660
I can't even find a place to hide!

201
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,980
If I argue with my mom,

202
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,060
where can I go?

203
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,100
Stop!

204
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,500
- You know...
- It's fine.

205
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,020
I have nowhere else to go

206
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,700
except at home.

207
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,420
Stop!

208
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,020
I...

209
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,340
Please don't do this.

210
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,740
We'll

211
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,260
definitely reopen it.

212
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,420
Right?

213
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,860
We can try different things.

214
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,340
I've figured it out.

215
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,380
I'll open a dance studio here.

216
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,340
I'll open

217
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,900
a body-training class.

218
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,980
It will definitely work.

219
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,820
My students

220
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,660
have appeared

221
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,290
on the front page
of Xinmin Evening News.

222
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,340
I think a game room is better.

223
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,460
We can

224
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,420
play mahjong together.

225
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,740
We'll have so much fun.

226
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,220
It's good.

227
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,900
Or we can open a grocery store

228
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,460
or even a supermarket.

229
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,740
This place is big enough, right?

230
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,580
Yes, exactly.

231
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,420
Alright.

232
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:46,980
It's okay.

233
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,340
Anyway, it's not our first time

234
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,740
going through this.

235
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:51,900
We can always

236
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,220
start over, right?

237
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,220
- Yes.
- Yes, yes.

238
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,820
This sounds so familiar.

239
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,580
Isn't there a song with these lyrics?

240
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,860

- It seems...
- Not right.

246
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,340
It's wrong, isn't it?

247
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,900
Yes, you missed a part.

248
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,140
- No.
- Something's missing.

249
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:18,980
You missed it.

250
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,320
Sing it again. I can't recall it.

251
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,300
Which part is missing?

252
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,260
Sing it again.

(Jiale Wontons)

265
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,700
You need to arrange

266
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,580
the items by color.

267
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,520
When customers see them,

268
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,820
they need to look good.

269
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,500
Hurry, tidy it up.

270
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,020
Success or failure,

271
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,700
life is about being bold.

272
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,020
Mr. Cao.

273
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,380
Sister Chen, why are you here?

274
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,340
For thermal underwear?

275
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,500
Suit yourself.

276
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,660
Mr. Cao,

277
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,580
can I

278
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,420
have a word with you?

279
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,540
Didn't you say

280
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,380
I was a bad guy?

281
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,940
Now you want to have a word.

282
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,140
What if I do something

283
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,100
wrong or immoral?

284
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:04,940
I can't explain it.

285
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,020
We can talk here.

286
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,700
Mr. Cao,

287
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,220
I came here today

288
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,060
only to

289
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,060
sincerely apologize to you.

290
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,980
What I said before

291
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,540
was really rude.

292
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,220
I hope you can

293
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,940
be tolerant

294
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,340
and forgive me, okay?

295
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,940
Don't flatter me.

296
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,220
Just make it clear.

297
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:33,920
I just want to

298
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,790
come back and continue working.

299
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,780
Sister Chen, I'm really sorry.

300
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,740
We don't need more staff now.

301
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,740
Look,

302
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,900
I have enough people.

303
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,860
You don't need...

304
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,100
But there are other counters.

305
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,380
When I came upstairs,

306
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,180
I noticed the shoe counter needed staff.

307
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,180
I can do it.

308
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,140
Now they want kneeling service.

309
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,820
I can do that, just like this.

310
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,620
What are you doing, Sister Chen?

311
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,060
Please don't do this.

312
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,300
It's awkward.

313
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,260
Mr. Cao, I'm sorry.

314
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,740
Sister Chen, Sister Chen.

315
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,100
Just make it clear.

316
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,460
Please don't do this.

317
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,980
It's awkward.

318
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,180
Debao.

319
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:16,670
Today,

320
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,900
I really want to

321
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,860
apologize to you.

322
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,500
No matter what happened before,

323
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,100
it was all my fault.

324
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,500
I really hope you can

325
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,620
forgive me.

326
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,900
Debao, I promise,

327
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,540
I will change.

328
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,300
I'll fix my bad temper.

329
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,750
I will perform well.

330
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,020
I...

331
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,380
The thing is,

332
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,300
I really need this job.

333
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,220
My husband...

334
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,820
The other day...

335
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,540
my husband...

336
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,500
Come on, I get it.

337
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,340
Okay, enough.

338
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,900
I don't want to hear
your family stories.

339
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,220
Please don't tell me, okay?

340
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:02,860
Sister Chen.

341
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,500
I've always been

342
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,340
a grateful and soft-hearted person,

343
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,180
okay?

344
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,420
You've come here so many times

345
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,700
to ask for my help,

346
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,620
so I'll make an exception.

347
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,260
I'll figure something out, okay?

348
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,220
Thank you, Mr. Cao. Thank you.

349
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,620
Go back, okay?

350
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,900
I'll try to arrange it,

351
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,580
and I'll call you, okay?

352
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,860
Okay, thank you so much.

353
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,820
I need to make one thing clear.

354
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,620
If you work for me,

355
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,540
your salary will still be 800 yuan.

356
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,580
Don't care about

357
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,660
others' salaries, okay?

358
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,660
I get it, Debao.

359
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,300
Thank you so much.

360
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,940
Okay, I got it. Just go home.

361
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,500
- Thank you!
- Goodbye.

362
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,420
I'll call you.

363
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:05,940
Let me go alone.

364
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,300
Please, thank you.

365
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,140
But...

366
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,300
The next program is a special one.

367
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,180
It is performed

368
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,580
by our dear guest.

369
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,460
- Another show?
- Daniel, come on!

370
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,300
No.

371
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,340
(Shanghai Puyang No. 2 Middle School)

372
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,180
What's happening?

373
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,820
This song is for a special girl,

374
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,060
who's the most charming girl
I've ever seen here.

375
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,540
She's humorous,

376
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,180
confident,

377
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,500
and sunny.

378
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,940
She's the most beautiful scenery

379
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,820
I've encountered in Shanghai this time.

380
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:54,980
Carmen!

381
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,180
This song

382
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,980
is for a special friend.

383
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,820
Liu Wanqing from Class 5.

384
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,380
Liu Wanqing

385
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,500
is the most charming girl he's met.

386
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,860
She's humorous,

387
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:12,940
confident, and sunny.

388
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,620
She's the most beautiful scenery

389
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,260
he's encountered in Shanghai.

390
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,740
This song is for you.

391
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,860
Thank you for showing me
a real Shanghai.

392
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,340
Your smile

393
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,580
blossoms my spring.

394
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,180
Liu Wanqing

395
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,060
showed him a real Shanghai.

396
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,820
She embodies the spring in Shanghai.

397
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,540

If you want to learn Chinese,

401
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,740
you can start by listening to
Chinese songs,

402
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,700
such as Jasmine.

Goodbye.

421
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,670
See you next time. Looking forward to it.

422
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,380
I'll miss you too.

423
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,740
Okay, bye.

424
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,060
Bye.

425
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:32,900
Bye.

426
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,100
Safe trip.

427
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,100
- Bye.
- Bye.

428
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,820
Thank you for the gift.

429
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,620
I really really really like it.

430
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,140
Come closer.

431
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,780
Yeah what?

432
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,660
Nothing.

433
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,540
I hope to see you soon.

434
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,300
Okay, take care of yourself.
See you next time.

435
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,460
Take care of yourself.

436
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,820
- Love you, guys.
- Bye.

438
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,460
Ka Men, you're cool.

439
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,300
So cool.

440
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,740
Lu Yao.

441
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,020
Thank you.

442
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,620
For what?

443
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,380
Daniel told me everything.

444
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,700
At first, he only planned

445
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,180
to say "thank you".

446
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,500
You encouraged him

447
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,860
to sing a whole song for me.

448
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,340
Of course, you can make a short speech,

449
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,020
but I think

450
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,180
you can give her a bigger surprise.

451
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,100
Yeah.

452
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,020
But...

453
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,460
How?

454
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,580
You play guitar, right?

455
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,700
It is a good idea.

456
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,620
I was just joking,

457
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,380
but Daniel really agreed.

458
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,700
To be honest, this time,

459
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,540
all the applause and cheers

460
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,260
belong to you.

461
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,820
I feel like

462
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,900
I'm a girl who lit
a whole box of matches.

463
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,020
I wish this light would last longer.

464
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,340
Did you forget what Daniel said?

465
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,060
You shine when you smile.

466
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,500
You don't need the match's light.

467
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,700
You can shine on your own.

468
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,180
So, smile.

469
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:43,940
That's right.

470
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:47,980
Thank you.

471
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:48,980
Again?

472
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,300
I've told you

473
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,300
we're good friends,

474
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,300
and you've been teaching me English.

475
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,970
I've been planning
to treat you to dinner.

476
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,460
Sure.

477
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,140
I can eat a lot.

478
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,340
No problem.

479
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,500
Let's make a deal.

480
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,260
Let's help each other more often.

481
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,820
Absolutely.

482
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,500
I think

483
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,620
I really need your help.

484
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,260
What?

485
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,620
No wonder

486
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,500
he's a reporter.

487
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,020
He's

488
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,380
really

489
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,260
handsome.

490
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,260
Lu Yao, thank you

491
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,540
for coming here.

492
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,780
It's okay. You're welcome.

493
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,740
It's my pleasure.

494
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,380
Qing often watches your show

495
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,580
at home.

496
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,420
Yes, that's right.

497
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,100
Momo also said

498
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,380
you're so popular at school.

499
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,580
That's right.

500
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,980
Every girl

501
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,380
is crazy for Lu Yao.

502
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,620
Thank you.

503
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,620
What about you, Qing?

504
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,540
I support Lu Yao.

505
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,580
Yao, thank you

506
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,220
for promoting our restaurant.

507
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,780
We really appreciate it.

508
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,060
You're so welcome.

509
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,220
Wanqing and I are good friends.

510
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,820
She has helped me a lot.

511
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,500
Your problem is also my problem.

512
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,260
That's wonderful.

513
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,620
Aunties, I brought back

514
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,100
to the News Center the newspaper

515
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,980
with the "flight attendant" headline.

516
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,020
And many seniors at the News Center

517
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:37,860
want to report it.

518
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,580
They want to report it.

519
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:40,740
We'll see

520
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,260
the most experienced one later.

521
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,100
(Delicious Dishes, Authentic Drinks)

522
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,020
Is it buttoned up?

523
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:46,860
Let me see.

524
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,540
I'm so nervous.

525
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,700
Nervous.

526
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,220
Okay, are you ready?

527
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,820
First of all, let's talk about

528
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,460
your feelings about

529
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,460
the flight attendant selection?

530
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,300
Feelings?

531
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,460
I... I don't know.

532
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,100
Too many feelings.

533
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,220
What should I say? You're up.

534
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,540
She'll speak.

535
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,300
I...

536
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,620
You blocked her face.

537
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,220
You're blocking me.

538
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,060
Although

539
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,740
we didn't pass

540
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,700
the flight attendant selection,

541
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,380
we all feel that

542
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,700
this experience

543
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,900
is a valuable treasure for us.

544
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,740
Yes.

545
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,780
If you had to use one word

546
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,980
to describe this treasure,

547
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,820
what would it be?

548
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,100
- Headline.
- Brooch.

549
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:37,900
I'd say...

550
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,260
I think it's "headline".

551
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,460
I'd use "fun".

552
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,780
I'd choose "brooch".

553
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,940
My brooch...

554
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,780
Can you see it?

555
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,940
The owner

556
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,540

557
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,620
my husband

558
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,500
Liu Songming

559
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,580
gave it to me.

560
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,220
- Not me.
- This one.

561
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,060
It's me.

562
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,140
This one.

563
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,660
Thank you.

565
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,700
- Yes, our qipao.
- Qipao.

566
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,340
Well, Fangfang...

567
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,500
- Fangfang, come.
- Sit down.

568
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,780
Fangfang, have a seat.

569
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,020
Come on, have a seat.

570
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:16,860
Come on.

571
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,060
- Hurry up.
- I...

572
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,460
- Fangfang.
- What should I say?

573
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,620
- Make some room.
- Hurry.

574
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,660
- You'll be on TV.
- I...

575
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,500
This is my first time
wearing a cheongsam.

576
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,940
Fangfang gave it to me.

577
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,890
(The "Flight Attendants" Are Here)
Is this you?

578
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,260
Yes.

579
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,500
Can you tell us
why you made qipaos for them?

580
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,460
And you went to
the interview with them in qipao.

581
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,540
I just think

582
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,700
they look beautiful in cheongsams.

583
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,660
I just like them.

584
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,060
I just like

585
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,500
to hang out with them.

586
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,340
Right?

587
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,900
Fangfang's cheongsams

588
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,340
made us believe

589
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,740
life has its ups and downs,

590
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,900
but at certain moments,

591
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,100
we are the most beautiful scenery.

592
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,540
Exactly.

593
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,020
We're all laid-off women.

594
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,180
For example, after being laid off,

595
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,460
I opened Jiale Cuisine, right?

596
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,020
Xiu'e went to sell thermal underwear.

597
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,740
I sell thermal underwear.

598
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,900
Thermal underwear.

599
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,380
And Aiping

600
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,100
works here during the day.

601
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:13,940
At night...

602
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,020
Let's not talk about it.

603
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,660
This time, thanks to the support

604
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,140
of our sisters,

605
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,380
old neighbors,

606
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,580
and...

607
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,620
Right?

608
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,980
That's why we're more confident.

609
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:29,980
Move forward.

610
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,820
Start over.

611
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,460
Start over.

612
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,420
Begin again.

613
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,260
Yes, yes.

614
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,900
So, do you have any plans?

615
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,060
Not at the moment.

616
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,460
- But...
- Yes.

617
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,500
It's just an idea,

618
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,100
but I want to give it a try.

619
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,740
How's the business today?

620
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,860
Great.

621
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:02,940
Sister Chen.

622
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,140
What are you doing? You scared me!

623
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,300
Mr. Cao, listen,

624
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,780
the pink one sells well.

625
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,620
You should stock
more of this pink color.

626
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,460
Listen,

627
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,700
you've called me Cao Debao for years,

628
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,980
and now it's Mr. Cao.

629
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:17,100
It sounds like you're mocking me.

630
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,580
From now on, just call me

631
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,740
Cao Debao, okay?

632
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,260
Zheng, here, your pay stub.

633
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,420
Thank you, Mr. Cao.

634
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,380
Here.

635
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,260
Thanks.

636
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,900
(Salary of This Month: 1100 Yuan)

637
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,220
Cao...

638
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,540
- Debao.
- Debao.

639
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,020
Eight...

640
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,380
Yes, that's correct.

641
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,060
Your monthly salary

642
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,220
is 800 yuan.

643
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,900
But you did well,

644
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,300
so there's a bonus.

645
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,100
Don't let them know,

646
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:46,940
okay?

647
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:57,980
(Satisfied with An Rui's Promise)

648

(Jiale Wontons)

649
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:03,260
As for the flight attendant selection...

650
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,580
- Miss,
- Hello, welcome.

651
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,420
you're on TV!

652
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,440
Yes.

653
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,980
Yes, that's me.

654
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,220
Come in, please.

655
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,780
- Have a seat.
- Please, come in.

656
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,140
Sit over there.

657
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,820
Welcome.

658
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,020
- Which table?
- Table No. 3.

659
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:18,860
Okay.

660
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,040
Here's the menu.

661
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,620
- Sorry for the wait.
- You're here.

662
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,140
Your business is booming.

663
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,100
Xiu'e, Fangfang is here.

664
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,540
Pei, we're out of

665
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:28,620
vegetable and pork wontons.

666
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,480
Don't sell them, okay?

667
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,820
What about fresh pork wontons?

668
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,620
About 40-50 grams left.

669
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,060
I told you to

670
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,020
stock more vegetables.

671
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,020
We sold out so early.

672
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,620
Enough. I'll buy them now.

673
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,780
Hurry back, okay?

674
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,900
Sure, I'll make it on time.

675
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,180
Liu Songming, vegetable and...

676
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,340
We're out of vegetable and pork wontons.

677
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,580
He already said it.

678
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,780
Didn't you hear it?

679
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,860
Are you deaf today?

680
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,420
You're quite feisty.

681
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,260
With the free advertising,

682
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,940
your business is booming.

683
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,860
We're famous now, right?

684
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,140
We're on TV.

685
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,540
Didn't expect the business is good.

686
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,900
Close the restaurant.

687
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,580
Come on, close it.

688
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,820
Close it.

689
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,620
Well, if I close it,

690
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,660
- what about our neighbors?
- Exactly.

691
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,940
I think we can compete with
Food Republic.

692
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:10,970
Food Republic is gone.

693
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,060
Checkout, please.

694
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,820
13 yuan.

695
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,780
Forget it, keep that change.

696
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,540
- The business is so good.
- Busy?

697
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,380
See you.

698
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:24,820
See you.

699
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,300
Zhang Qiming.

700
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,140
So busy.

701
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,260
Zhang Qiming!

702
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,260
What?

703
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,900
You're free today, right?

704
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,500
You're here to help out again.

705
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,140
I'm quite good at this.

706
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,380
I used to work on Huanghe Road.

707
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,300
Well,

708
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,980
Aiping has been up late studying.

709
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,580
Aiping,

710
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,620
what are you working on?

711
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,660
You mentioned a plan.

712
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,980
We don't know anything about it.

713
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,660
It's barely started.

714
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,500
Not started? Just tell us.

715
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,540
We're Cheongsam Sisters, right?

716
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,180
Tell us! We might be able to help.

717
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,020
Right?

718
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,940
What? What does it mean?

719
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,260
What does it mean?

720
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,660
- Darts?
- Nanny Rong!

721
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,780
No, no, nothing.

722
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,420
What does it mean? He...

723
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,380
I want to learn TCM,

724
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,700
acupuncture.

725
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,020
TCM and acupuncture?

726
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,660
- It's difficult.
- That's impressive.

727
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,700
I've told her

728
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,780
it's really difficult,

729
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,220
but Aiping is determined.

730
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,180
She said

731
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,380
this is a lifelong skill.

732
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,380
It's a valuable skill.

733
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,040
It gets more valuable over time.

734
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,780
Well, the notes she took

735
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,620
are this thick.

736
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,340
There's a Chinese Medicine Clinic
in Hongkou.

737
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,540
And Doctor Zhan

738
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,700
is taking in students.

739
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,740
Well, I think

740
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,980
I can study by myself.

741
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,460
Then I'll try to apply for it.

742
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,060
I support you.

743
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,780
Now she works here during the day

744
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,380
and attends classes at night.

745
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,020
She has no time for me at all.

746
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,580
Zhang Qiming, listen,

747
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,460
don't hold Aiping back.

748
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,580
Don't stop her from progressing.

749
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,900
Yes, just focus on your work

750
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,140
and talk less.

751
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,180
Who is Guan Aiping?

752
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,300
She's the pride of No. 9 Factory.

753
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,540
Of course.

754
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,380
Exactly.

755
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:57,250
Zhang Qiming,

756
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,940
you're either busy with business

757
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,140
or busy with romance.

758
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,460
You should spend more time with Mao Tou.

759
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,740
- Why?
- He...

760
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,340
The High School Entrance Exam is coming.

761
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,460
It's a crucial time.

762
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,220
As his father,

763
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,820
you act like an invisible person.

764
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,660
You've ignored him.

765
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,020
Yang Min should've taken him away.

766
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:13,900
It'd be good for him.

767
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,780
Forget it. I didn't mean it.

768
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,220
You're as harsh

769
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,940
- Care about Mao Tou.
- as Nanny Rong.

770
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:23,940
- What?
- You're harsh.

771
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,890
I'm very serious.

772
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,780
None of your business.

773
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,860
- What?
- If you have time,

774
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,900
sweep the floor

775
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,410
- and mop it.
- You're the waiter.

776
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,940
Zhang Qiming, I'm really serious.

777
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,580
Pay attention to Mao Tou.

778
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,700
I'm sorry.

779
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,460
I laughed too loudly.

780
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,980
Not at all.

781
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,780
Dad, why don't you go out and have some fun?

782
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,540
You little imp.

783
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,580
You blamed me for ignoring you.

784
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,140
Now you don't want my company.

785
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,580
Prince Mao Tou,

786
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,820
you're hard to please.

787
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,220
I'm studying.

788
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,580
You're eating sunflower seeds

789
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,740
and laughing all the time.

790
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,740
I can't concentrate.

791
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,460
If I can't get into the school,

792
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,180
it's all your fault.

793
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,580
You've been really stressed lately.

794
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,300
I hope you can relax a bit.

795
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:33,860
Honestly,

796
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,300
if you get into an average high school,

797
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,740
I'll hang a "Top Scholar" sign

798
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,900
right on the door.

799
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,120
No. 2 Middle School is hard to get into.

800
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,660
Not everyone can make it.

801
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,740
You don't believe me, do you?

802
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,540
It's not like that.

803
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,540
Look at me.

804
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,500
I was bad at studying.

805
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,540
Your mom wasn't

806
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,740
good at it, either.

807
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,740
Aren't you aware

808
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,940
of your grades?

809
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,820
You've scored zero

810
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,180
many times,

811
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,540
at least 3 times.

812
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,900
You're bad at it, too.

813
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:02,860
Isn't that right?

814
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:03,820
So what?

815
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:04,820
Look at me.

816
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:07,500
I didn't even finish middle school.

817
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,420
Besides,

818
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,980
I'm rich now.

819
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,690
So, don't worry.

820
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,180
You'll always have food to eat.

821
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,820
Don't push yourself too hard.

822
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,820
Go out.

823
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:22,760
I get it.

824
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:23,860

How do shrimps walk?

833
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,020
Like this, right?

834
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,180
How do crabs walk?

835
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,220
Like this, sideways.

836
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,060

838

Why do you have to compete

839
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,580
with Xiao Han or Qian Jiayue?

840
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,460
What's the point?

841
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,580
Why is it unnecessary?

842
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:56,900
I have to.

843
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,220
I have to prove myself.

844
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,820

00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,340
Qian Jiayue.

952
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,620
Chang Wuji.

953
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,620
Qian Jiayue, I'm buying breakfast.

954
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,180
Shall we go to school together?

955
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:55,900
Sure.

956
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,100
Genius, your buns.

957
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,620
Okay.

958
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,020
Thank you, Auntie.

959
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,140
Take it. Enjoy.

960
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,540
Thanks.

961
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,580
Qian Jiayue, did you have breakfast?

962
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,780
Yes, I did.

963
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,260
Okay.

964
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,300
Let's go.

965
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,380
- Let's go.
- Go.

966
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,460
- Ride safely.
- Okay.

967
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,300
Study hard every day.

968
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,940
I'll always support you.

969
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:32,780
Okay.

970
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,980
(Jiale Wontons, Welcome)

971
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:48,980
(Ji)

972
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:52,740
(Ji)

973
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:54,940
Perfect.

974
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,060
It's balanced.

975
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:01,860
(Ji)

976
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,620
You keep coming
to the wonton restaurant.

977
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,060
It's not for us.

978
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,500
You want to go to school
with Qian Jiayue, right?

979
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,540
I'll make it clear.

980
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,940
Just tell me,

981
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,180
how do you feel about Qian Jiayue?

982
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,780
I don't know how I feel.

983
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,740
You don't know?

984
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,260
It's possible.

985
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:33,900
I'll rephrase it,

986
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,260
would you prefer to stay

987
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,780
with the three of us,

988
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,620
or do you prefer to be

989
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,540
alone with Qian Jiayue?

990
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,620
I haven't thought about it.

991
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:46,940
Let's do an experiment.

992
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,220
After school,

993
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,060
I'll find a chance to leave with Chen Mo.

994
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,140
You'll take Qian Jiayue home alone.

995
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,380
Then compare them carefully.

996
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,540
Okay.

997
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,180
However,

998
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,300
it's not enough.

999
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,060
We need to do more experiments

1000
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,140
to draw conclusions.

1001
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:10,500
(Class 5, Grade 10)

1002
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,060
Memorizing formulas is so hard.

1003
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,020
Chang Wuji.

1004
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,460
Do you have secret skills
to memorize formulas?

1005
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,280
The more I learn,
the more confused I get.

1006
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:23,860
Formulas?

1007
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,500
No need to memorize them.

1008
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,220
Just derive them when you need them.

1009
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,380
See?

1010
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:37,340
That's the gap between gods
and ordinary people.

1011
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,340
The gap between them

1012
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,940
is not that hard to overcome.

1013
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,820
Didn't Xu Xian and Lady Bai
get together?

1014
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,180
They even had a smart kid.

1015
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,580
Lady Bai isn't a god.

1016
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,740
She's a monster.

1017
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,540
Ready? Let's go.

1018
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,020
Wait a moment.

1019
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:52,940
By the way, Chen Mo,

1020
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,380
isn't it a sports event on Friday?

1021
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:55,980
You signed up for the 800m,

1022
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,020
and I for the shot put.

1023
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,020
Let's practice together.

1024
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,860
Qian Jiayue, we won't go with you.

1025
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:00,860
I don't need practice.

1026
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,860
Practice with me, please.

1027
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,780
I'll practice with you.

1028
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:07,660
I'm almost done here.

1029
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:08,780
No need.

1030
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,580
You lack athletic skills.

1031
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,500
Just let Chang Wuji teach you

1032
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,980
how to memorize formulas.

1033
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,380
Let's go.

1034
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,580
Have you packed up?

1035
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,860
Let's leave together.

1036
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,980
I'm ready.

1037
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,280
- Let's go
- Okay.

1038
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,340
How did you solve

1039
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,340
the math question today?

1040
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,980
That question is actually in the book.

1041
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,620
Qian Jiayue.

1042
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,340
Mao Tou?

1043
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,420
What are you doing here?

1044
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,220
Just passing by.

1045
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:57,580
Passing by?

1046
00:41:58,740 --> 00:41:59,980
You pass by here after school?

1047
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,060
I...

1048
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:02,940
After school...

1049
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:05,380
I...

1050
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,700
Well, I want to get into

1051
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,780
No. 2 Middle School.

1052
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,340
I should visit and get familiar with

1053
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:13,300
my future school.

1054
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,190
There's no point in doing this.

1055
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,700
Are you going home together?

1056
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:24,980
Yes.

1057
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,060
I want to eat noodles at Ka Men's place.

1058
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,860
Qian Jiayue, do you want to join me?

1059
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,460
- I...
- She needs to eat at home.

1060
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:34,980
Okay.

1061
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:37,780
Chang Wuji,

1062
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,060
are your parents playing mahjong again?

1063
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,460
Well...

1064
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:54,900
