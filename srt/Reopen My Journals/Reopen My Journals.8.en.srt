24
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,240
Qian Jiayue,

25
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,690
you're involved in this.

26
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,160
What's your opinion?

27
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,280
I think

28
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,040
we should give them another chance

29
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,280
to return the money themselves.

30
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,600
Alright,

31
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,960
as you say.

32
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,630
Now,

33
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,680
class is over.

34
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,430
The money isn't back yet,

35
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,430
how can we leave?

36
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,710
It's not time for class to end.

37
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,870
This lunch,

38
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,030
we'll have fried chicken wings.

39
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,120
You guys go eat early

40
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,910
and give him

41
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,150
a bit more time.

42
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,700
I hope that by the time

43
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,560
when you're back from lunch,

44
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,400
the money

45
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,190
will be back with Qian Jiayue.

46
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,910
But if it's still not returned,

47
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,240
then I'm sorry,

48
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,120
you will be punished.

49
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,120
I'll let Ms. Wu handle it.

50
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,400
Class dismissed.

51
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,400
Qian Jiayue,

52
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,910
I'll be with you

53
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,310
through lunch today.

54
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,560
If the money returned,

55
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,800
you have to admit

56
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,080
I'm innocent.

59
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:06,960
Excuse me, please.

60
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,840
Please let me through.

61
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,470
It's back!

(Kinship Concealment, Justice-supreme,

63
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,560
The money's back.

64
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,320
Who do you think stole it?

65
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,750
It's infuriating!

66
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,000
I almost got framed.

67
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,030
I was so scared.

68
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,910
If I find out who did it,

69
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,240
I'll handle him.

70
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,240
How could a student

71
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,360
do something like this!

72
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,750
It's terrifying.

73
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,240
What will he be like in the future?

74
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,590
And you…

75
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,240
You even questioned me.

76
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,750
I didn't know what to say.

77
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,560

80
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,000
Mr. Jiang.

81
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,680
Sorry, sorry.

82
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,510
Little imp,
you are causing trouble again!

83
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,950
If Mr. Jiang hadn't told me,

84
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,190
I'd still be in the dark.

85
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,240
What did you promise me before?

86
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,490
You said you wouldn't hit me.

87
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,560
Little imp, you promised me

88
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,880
you wouldn't cause trouble again.

89
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,110
Enough!

90
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,400
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,560
Sorry, Mr. Jiang.

92
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,140
What's he in trouble for this time?

93
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,510
It's not a big deal,

94
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,590
just cheating,

95
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,160
group cheating!

96
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,360
Impressive!

97
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,480
(Office 1)
Even got the math class rep

98
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,720
into it.

99
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,160
This time, expulsion is unavoidable.

100
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,320
No, it can't be.

101
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,640
He's in Grade 9,

102
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,960
right?

103
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,340
It's still compulsory education.

104
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,950
You're right,

105
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,430
compulsory education.

106
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,160
After he's expelled from here,

107
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,430
he can continue

108
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,390
his education somewhere else.

109
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,360
Mr. Jiang,

110
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,680
please don't give up on him.

111
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,720
Please don't.

112
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,870
He's still
part of our nations's future, right?

113
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,870
He's not exactly good material

114
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,090
and to be molded into steel.

115
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,270
The little imp is beyond hope!

116
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,630
But what if he has hidden potentials?

117
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,000
He's like worthless mud.

118
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,910
But

119
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,440
if you use it to plant a lotus root,

120
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,800
maybe you can receive

121
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,680
a lotus.

122
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,520
Come on.

123
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,390
Let me show you the lotus.

124
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,560
Seeing him makes me nauseous.

125
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,070
A lotus? Humph.

126
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,920
The Art Teacher asked them

127
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,800
to draw a picture related to the family.

128
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,480
Look at what he drew.

129
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,000
Here, take a look.

130
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,440
Look at that.

131
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,620
(Mr. Jiang, farewell)

132
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,190
That's me.

133
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,120
Mr. Jiang, you misunderstood.

134
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,360
That's me, his family.

135
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,240
This little imp has no respect for me.

136
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,870
- It's you?
- Yes, it's me.

137
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,950
You're Mr. Jiang?

138
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,540
It's your farewell ceremony?

139
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,460
(Mr. Jiang, farewell)

140
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,630
You little imp!

141
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,600
I can't teach him

142
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,360
anymore.

143
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,390
Mr. Zhang,

144
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,630
he's in Grade 9 now.

145
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,120
Yes, the graduating year.

146
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,430
I can't let one bad apple

147
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,270
ruin the whole batch.

148
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,200
Mr. Zhang,

149
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:26,970
I've been teaching for many years,

150
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,120
and I can tell you

151
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,680
I can already see

152
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,800
what he'll be like in the future.

153
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,920
If he doesn't change,

154
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,630
he'll turn into a total failure.

155
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,190
In society, he'll be a trash,

156
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,560
a loser.

157
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,630
If I don't discipline him now,

158
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,800
who knows in the future,

159
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,480
what awful things he'll do?

160
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,320
You know what I mean?

161
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,000
What are you doing?

162
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,230
Sorry about that.

163
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,950
The table didn't line up.

164
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,400
Son, let's go.

165
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:01,910
You…

166
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,160
Unbelievable.

167
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,270
You're unbelievable.

168
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,190
Zhang Yang, I'm telling you,

169
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,950
don't let me see you again.

170
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,070
Dad, is your foot okay?

171
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,320
It's fine.

172
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,630
If it hurts, just say so.

173
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,600
Little imp,

174
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,270
didn't you say

175
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,110
you'd study hard?

176
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,310
Why did you cheat again?

177
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,200
I can't solve it.

178
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,630
Godmother said you used to cheat.

179
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,240
That Chen Xiu'e.

180
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,360
I cheated because

181
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,000
I didn't have the condition to study.

182
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,390
When I started junior high,

183
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,360
society was a mess.

184
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,540
I had no chance to study.

185
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,360
If I had conditions like this,

186
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,240
such good conditions,

187
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,600
I would've studied hard.

188
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,480
Godmother also said

189
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,750
studying is useless.

190
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,790
College grads end up

191
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,790
working eighth graders like you.

192
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,270
Chen Xiu'e is an idiot.

193
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,510
Let's sit over there.

194
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,550
We'll talk about this.

195
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,550
Don't sit so far away.

196
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,550
I don't bite.

197
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,750
Mao Tou,

198
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,870
I was a rascal when I was young,

199
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,960
way worse than you.

200
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,790
No one respected me.

201
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,230
I've worked so hard these years

202
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,790
just because I wanted to...

203
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,630
I…

204
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,320
To prove your worth.

205
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,480
You said it when you were drunk.

206
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:50,510
I'm fighting

207
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,000
for my own dignity.

208
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,600
You're my son.

209
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,780
Can you have some pride,

210
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,680
please?

211
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,080
For my sake.

212
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,790
As the saying goes,

213
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,640
"Dragon beget dragons,
phoenix beget phoenixes,

214
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,790
and a rat's son knows how to dig."

215
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,080
Make us proud.

216
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,630
Show your teachers

217
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,830
and classmates

218
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,720
that my son

219
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,910
can become a dragon,

220
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,000
a phoenix

221
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,150
with your own effort,

222
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,470
not a rat who digs holes,

223
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,830
that no one cares about.

224
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,360
Please, just try, okay?

225
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,890
Save me some face.

226
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,100
Stand up for yourself, okay?

227
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,510
I was wrong before.

228
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,060
I shouldn't

229
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,670
have pushed you so much.

230
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:46,720
From now on,

231
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,280
I...

232
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,350
will change.

233
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,630
Dad,

234
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:59,720
don't worry.

235
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,720
You stood up for me,

236
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,200
and I'll do the same.

237
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,150
If I made a promise to my bros,

238
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,870
I'd never back out.

239
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,200
Little imp,

240
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,320
calling me your bro.

241
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,600
Since we're brothers,

242
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,600
help me up then.

243
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,080
Come on, big bro.

244
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,110
Big bro,

245
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,510
so I…

246
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,600
Do I have to drop out now?

247
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,670
Asking a middle schooler to drop out

248
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,790
is technically illegal.

249
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,750
I'll see what I can do.

250
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,510
Go write two self-reflection letters,

251
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,200
no less than 6,000 words each,

252
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,240
and hand them to Mr. Jiang.

253
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,750
Why two?

254
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,000
One is for me.

255
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,870
I was too harsh back there.

256
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,820
I set a bad example.

257
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,480
Don't be like me, understand?

258
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,390
By the way,

259
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,200
I've thought it through.

260
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,750
I really like

261
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,590
Brother Xiao Han

262
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,720
and his mom.

263
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,720
I'm okay

264
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,000
with you two being together.

265
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,960
I used to…

266
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,200
I used to think

267
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,270
how could they possibly like you?

268
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,550
But I underestimated you.

269
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,570
If you act

270
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,960
like you did just now,

271
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,870
keep that spirit up,

272
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,440
maybe

273
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,120
you can win Brother Xiao Han over.

274
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,320
I'll try.

275
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:48,990
Yang Min

276
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,000
mentioned many times in her letters

277
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,600
that you should go study in Japan.

278
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,200
What do you think?

279
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,800
There's no rush.

280
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,270
Take your time.

281
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,910
People see things differently

282
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,270
at different stages in life,

283
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,440
and get different answers.

284
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,070
Think it over and tell me.

285
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,480
Whatever you choose,

286
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,320
I'll support you.

287
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,960
That's great!

288
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,270
The 15-inch color monitor,

289
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,630
Pentium 3 processor,

290
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,150
and 128MB memory,

291
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,120
the best configuration right now.

292
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,360
You have made

293
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,600
a tremendous contribution

294
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,550
to cultivating talents
for the 21st-century.

295
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,910
No, not at all.

296
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,720
The school has worked so hard

297
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,120
to foster talents
of our motherland,

298
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,750
though some of them
might not be so talented.

299
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,120
The fact that

300
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,720
Zhang Yang has been placed on probation

301
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,000
fully reflects

302
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,840
the school's

303
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,030
fine tradition of teaching all.

304
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,320
I'm very grateful.

305
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,550
It's our responsibility

306
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,320
and honor

307
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,510
to help the school

308
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,510
in any way we can.

309
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,030
I'm truly grateful.

310
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,750
Thank you very much.

311
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,910
Thank you!

312
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,240
(Qiming Computer Room)
My pleasure.

313
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,510
If you need anything, just ask.

314
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,440
- Okay.
- Thank you.

315
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,540
(Puyang Road)

316
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,510
This is really brand new.

317
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:32,870
Yes, it is.

318
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,720
Only the packaging is missing,

319
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,870
it's never been used.

320
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:37,590
Fifty yuan.

321
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,870
Fifty? How can it be just fifty?

322
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,840
Look.

323
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,750
The receipt says 1,250 yuan.

324
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,840
How can it only worth fifty?

325
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,750
Young man, I don't care about that.

326
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,630
I recycle scraps.

327
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,700
I buy scrap metal by weight.

328
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:51,790
The price is set.

329
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,440
Are you selling it or not?

330
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,910
But, kid,

331
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,270
this washing machine is so new.

332
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,510
It's a pity to sell it.

333
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,390
Since you got a new one,

334
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,720
the new one must be better.

335
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,200
Why keep the old one?

336
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,120
You can sell the old one.
I'll pay sixty for it.

337
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,680
Han,

338
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,690
Dad's gonna protect the equipment
at the factory.

339
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,030
You protect mom at home.

(Martyr Xiao Youguang, Firefighting Hero,
His Spirit Lives On)

341
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,000
He doesn't need it.

342
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,360
He and his mom will
be looked after soon.

343
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,480
We should tell the kids

344
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,720
sooner.

345
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,270
That way, I can take care of you both.

346
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:11,150
Mao Tou's dad got you
a new pair of sneakers.

347
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,290
Father and son together.

348
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:13,650
Matching shoes for brothers.

(Puyang New Village)

350
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,510
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

351
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,630
Main road or shortcut?

352
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,200
No time. Let's take the shortcut.

353
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,840
Ka Men.

354
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,490
- Wang Bin.
- What are you doing?

355
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,320
Those punks again.

356
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,390
They're all from the tech school

357
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,480
and pretty tough.

358
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,720
What are they doing?

359
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:05,030
I think the boy's in for a rough time.

360
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,080
What's a rough time?

361
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,240
Let's not do this

362
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,160
the hard way.

363
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,590
Hear me?

364
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:12,190
I don't have money.

365
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,160
I only have five yuan.

366
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,480
No more?

367
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,490
If I find more, you're in trouble.

00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,680
What are you doing?

370
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,590
Stop it!

From No. 2 Middle School?

Are girls from that school this fierce?

374
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,880
Give him back the money.

375
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,440
Or you'll face consequences.

376
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,550
Do you know who we are?

377
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,190
See this?

Three burn marks.

381
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,830
Do you know whose turf this is?

382
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,070
It's not your place to act tough here.

383
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,480
I thought that school was full of nerds.

384
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,400
Didn't expect to find a beauty there.

385
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,110
Can I have your number?

386
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,240
Let's hang out later.

387
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,470
- Get lost.
- What's your problem?

388
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,350
I...

389
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,190
Sorry.

390
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,040
Sorry.

391
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,110
- Let's go.
- I won't.

392
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:11,960
I'm not leaving.

393
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,390
Unless they give the money back.

394
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,350
Don't cause trouble.

395
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,070
Want the money back?

396
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,200
We'll let it slide this time.

397
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,000
Next time if I find you stashing money,

398
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,640
one smack for one yuan.

399
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,840
Do you hear me?

400
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:32,670
You…

401
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,400
Are you okay?

402
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,110
You just let them leave?

403
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,240
Xiao Han just didn't

404
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,830
want to escalate things.

405
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:03,830
There were four of them.

406
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,000
So what?

407
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,590
Do you have
any sense of justice?

408
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,430
Chen Mo!

409
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,690
Do you know what it means
to stand up for justice?

410
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,790
Why should I intervene?

411
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,720
Should I fight them?

412
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,960
Alright, we all already

413
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,400
sent them away.

414
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,590
We send them away?

415
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,000
Someone just hid like a coward

416
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
and let them get away.

417
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,200
They are thugs,

418
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,590
and we're students,

419
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,540
students from No. 2 Middle School.

420
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,490
Do you know the consequences
of fighting?

421
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,720
We need to get into college

422
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,920
via Entrance Examination.

423
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,640
Is that all you care about?

424
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,790
What do you care about?

425
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,400
Being a hero?
Taking the limelight?

426
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,790
Is that meaningful?

427
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,430
Brother Xiao Han,

428
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,960
Chen Mo doesn't mean that.

429
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,680
Enough, stop arguing. Let's go.

430
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,690
Time for school, Xiao Han.

431
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,350
I used to think you were nice.

432
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,750
Turns out, first impression is never wrong.

433
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,270
People like you

434
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,790
only think about themselves.

435
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,340
So what if you have good grades?

436
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,750
So what if teachers like you?

437
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,680
So what if you get into a top university?

438
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,000
You're selfish.

439
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I can't stand people like you.

440
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,840
Chen Mo!

441
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,830
Stop it.

442
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,550
Don't take it out on Xiao Han.

443
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,270
Yeah, there are too many of them.

444
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,680
We can't play the hero.

445
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,920
Even if we can't be heros,

446
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,480
but we can't be cowards either.

447
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,670
Fine.

448
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,560
I am a coward.

449
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,790
I am a coward.

450
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,440
Why should I be a hero?

451
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,790
What's so great about that?

452
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,070
When you need a hero,

453
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,640
you ask him to sacrifice.

454
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,680
But what did you do?

455
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,400
Besides clapping for him

456
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,390
and shedding a few tears,

457
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:33,510
what else did you do?

458
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,190
You forget about him
as soon as he's gone.

459
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,590
Do you even know

460
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,110
he has a family?

461
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,830
He has a wife and a kid.

462
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,350
Do you know how painful it is

463
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,190
for his family?

464
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,110
Why do you expect others to sacrifice

465
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,630
just to fulfill your own emotional needs?

466
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:17,180
(Class 5, Grade 10)

467
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:20,630
Chen Mo,

468
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,440
I've been thinking,

469
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,830
and I think I should

470
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,750
tell you about Xiao Han's family

471
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,030
so you don't misunderstand him.

472
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
What do you want to say?

473
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,420
Sacrificed in an act of bravery.

474
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,570
Years ago, a fire broke out
at No. 9 Factory.

475
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,160
To protect the production line

476
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:43,560
with new German machines,

477
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,790
his dad joined the firefighting.

478
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,560
In the end,

479
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,590
the fire was put out

480
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,200
and the machines were saved.

481
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:51,920
But Xiao Han's father

482
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,240
inhaled too much smoke

483
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,000
and

484
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,310
passed away.

485
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,080
So…

486
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,510
what happened after that?

487
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:02,630
Then

488
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,790
Xiao Han's dad was honored as a martyr,

489
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,040
a hero.

490
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,960
The factory also provided a house

491
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,640
for them.

492
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,070
When I was little,

493
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,590
in the factory kindergarten

494
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,200
they often talk about

495
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,310
Xiao Youguang's heroic deeds.

496
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,510
But…

497
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:21,880
But what?

498
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,000
But now, No. 9 Factory is gone.

499
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:28,110
The machines Xiao Han's dad saved

500
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,680
were scrapped

501
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,960
along with the other machines.

502
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,590
Brother Xiao Han doesn't say it,

503
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,080
but he must

504
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,200
be really sad.

505
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,820
(Puyang New Village)

506
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,190
When we meet,

507
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,510
you just greet him

508
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,680
and pretend nothing happened.

509
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,740
Things will be good again.

510
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,590
Ka Men.

511
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,590
What are you doing here?

512
00:22:59,070 --> 00:22:59,920
Where's Xiao Han?

513
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,350
He left a while ago.

514
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,210
He has the Olympiad Math Team
Competitive Exam.

515
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,840
Oh right.

516
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,400
I forgot about that.

517
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:09,790
You need him for something?

518
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,340
If you need something, just tell me.

519
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,750
It doesn't concern you.

520
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,760
Just leave.

521
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,550
I'm just being a caring classmate.

522
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,390
Let's go.

523
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:22,300
(Jiale Wontons)

524
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:27,380
(Olympiad Math Team Competitive Exam)

525
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,160
Mr. Zhou, I'm done.

526
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,790
Finished already?

527
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,880
Have you checked it?

528
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,680
No need to check.

529
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,780
(Exam Room 5)

530
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,640
You still have time.

531
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,640
Take your time, everyone.

532
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:13,820
(Stay calm, think carefully,
review the questions, write neatly)

533
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,350
Alright.

534
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:25,630
Time's up.

535
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,200
Pens down, everyone.

536
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,920
Hand in your papers.

537
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,920
Did you finish the last question?

538
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,430
No.

539
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,830
It's in my reference book.

540
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,510
So are some
multiple-choice questions.

541
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,640
- Look at this one.
- It's okay.

542
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,520
The exam's over.

543
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,700
(Memorial Museum)

544
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,550
So this is your secret base.

545
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:03,950
Yes.

546
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,640
It was Mao Tou's grandparents' house.

547
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,350
They moved to Jinxiu Garden.

548
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,440
So this place is vacant.

549
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,030
Now it's where we study

550
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:11,960
and hang out.

551
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,000
Look,

552
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,960
this is our desk.

553
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,040
Each of us

554
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,000
has a drawer.

555
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,310
(Xiao Han)
That's Xiao Han's handwriting, right?

556
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:23,790
How do you know?

557
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,200
It's so neat and structured,

558
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,430
just like him.

559
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,750
Granny also said

560
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,690
his writing is the same
as in the copybook.

561
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,780
(Xiao Han)

562
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,510
Opening of No. 9 Factory Memory Museum.

563
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,070
Yes, my Granny used to work
at No. 9 Factory.

564
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,960
So did Brother Xiao Han's parents,

565
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,110
and Mao Tou's parents.

566
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,090
They were all part of it.

567
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,030
Also mine and Wang Bin's.

568
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,640
Now, they've all been laid off.

569
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,750
The factory's closed.

570
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,190
Qian Jiayue,

571
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,350
are you going to the opening?

572
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,310
Of course.

573
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,830
Granny was the union leader.

574
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,070
So I'd definitely go with her.

575
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:07,800
Considering Xiao Han's father's situation,

576
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,640
will they attend it?

577
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,200
We are definitely going.

578
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,920
Director Dong already gave me

579
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,440
the invitation.

580
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,240
Thank you.

581
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:23,960
You're welcome!

582
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,920
He specifically mentioned it,

583
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,880
and Mr. Zhang also told me.

584
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,510
So I'm checking with you again

585
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,270
and invite you to share

586
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,030
Xiao Youguang's deeds with us,

587
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,110
okay?

588
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,880
Forget it.

589
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,000
In such settings,

590
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,480
let the leaders speak.

591
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,590
You're his family,
so you'd be more suitable,

592
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,630
right?

593
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,020
Just make sure you're on time.

594
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,270
I'll meet you at the door.

595
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,920
Alright, I won't keep you.

596
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,760
See you there.

597
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:52,620
- Okay.
- Thank you.

598
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:53,870
You're too kind.

599
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,430
Mom,

600
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,590
don't go.

601
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,830
They've forgotten

602
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,310
about Xiao Youguang's deeds,

603
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,840
so why should you remind them?

604
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,790
Why bring up our pain

605
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,720
and make them remember?

606
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,750
Then they'll gossip

607
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,920
about it.

608
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,310
What's the point?

609
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:25,180
(Shanghai Puyang No. 2 Middle School)

610
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,780
(Class 1, Grade 10)

611
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,260
(Preface)

612
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,430
What's this?

613
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,350
The Olympiad Math materials.

614
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,510
I made a copy for you.

615
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,790
You didn't make the Team this time.

616
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:37,970
But don't worry.

617
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,350
There's another chance.

618
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,880
I'll be waiting for you.

619
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:42,800
Actually,

620
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,450
not everyone has Chang Wuji's talent.

621
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,680
So it's normal to use some extra help.

622
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,750
Thank you for your concern,

623
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,310
but I really don't need it.

624
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,110
Xiao Han,

625
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:58,110
you eventually figured out about

626
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,750
about the Self-Reliance Scholarship.

627
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,310
Be realistic.

628
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:04,340
A second prize in the competition
grants college admission.

629
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,960
Even a third prize gets you extra points.

630
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,110
Is being so aloof really worth it?

631
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,480
Zhao Tingting is the only girl in our grade

632
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,550
who made the Team.

633
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:25,670
She's amazing.

634
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,640
Chang Wuji is more impressive.

635
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:29,390
Finished in 30 minutes and topped the class.

636
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,270
Xiao Han didn't make it.

637
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,310
He fell from grace.

638
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,510
Brother Xiao Han.

639
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,110
You eventually figured out about

640
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,790
about the Self-Reliance Scholarship.

641
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,240
Be realistic.

642
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,920
Is being so aloof really worth it?

643
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,440
You're the butler's son.

644
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,280
Even if we can't be heros,

645
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,750
but we can't be cowards either.

646
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,110
We should tell the kids sooner.

647
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:11,000
That way, I can take care of you both.

648
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:11,920
You're selfish.

649
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,310
I can't stand people like you.

650
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,110
What's it gonna be?

651
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,350
First it's tomorrow,

652
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,440
then it's the day after?

653
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,680
If you don't have it tomorrow,

654
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,510
I'll report this to your school.

655
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,750
I know your class

656
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,160
and your name.

657
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,480
Did you hear me?

658
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,790
What are you staring at?

659
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,320
Get lost.

660
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:58,710
Darn it.

661
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,150
Look at him.

662
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,960
Last time you knew not to interfere.

663
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:04,510
Get lost now.

664
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,350
I said, get lost!

665
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,040
Get lost!

666
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:28,630
Xiao Han!

667
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,960
You're going too far.

668
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,940
- Chen Mo, ride faster.
- Xiao Han!

669
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,550
And Liu Jianfeng.

670
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,350
Chen Mo!

671
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,000
Chen Mo!

672
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,830
You're tough, huh?

673
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,720
Ka Men, go get the teacher.

674
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:01,870
Be careful.

675
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,560
Stop it!

676
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,840
- Chen Mo!
- The lovely lady from before.

677
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,000
What?

678
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,560
Chen Mo.

679
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,000
- Come on.
- Put it down.

680
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,310
You wanna die, huh?

681
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,280
Put it down.

682
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,430
Get people.

683
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,440
- Mao Tou!
- Brother Xiao Han.

684
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,240
Chen Mo!

685
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,520
Mao Tou!

686
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:56,430
Get away!

687
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:58,700
Get away!

688
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:02,960
Are you okay?

689
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,560
Xiao Han!

690
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:38,480
You guys really have some nerve.

691
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,400
Fighting in groups.

692
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,990
Is this what you should do?

693
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,040
Ms. Wu,

694
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,640
actually,

695
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,280
this isn't…

696
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,880
This isn't their fault.

697
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,310
They were just saving me.

698
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,720
It was those thugs...

699
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,640
Did I ask you to speak?

700
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,350
No matter the reason,

701
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,400
no matter the cause,

702
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:01,160
fighting is never right.

703
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,480
Integrity, diligence, responsibility,

704
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:12,590
virtue…

705
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,540
Stop looking!

706
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,590
Remember them well.

707
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,280
From now on,

708
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:24,550
this must never happen again.

709
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:25,590
Got it?

710
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,440
Got it.

711
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:27,960
Got it?

712
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,190
Got it.

713
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,440
Each of you

714
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,750
write a self-reflection.

715
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,640
I will personally read them.

716
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,680
Hand them in tomorrow.

717
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:42,950
Dismissed.

718
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:46,750
Ms. Wu, this way.

719
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,310
Oh, this is your school.

720
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,350
Are you two okay?

721
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,510
- I'm fine.
- Let's go, boss.

722
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,790
- And you?
- I'm fine.

723
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:58,790
Are you alright?

724
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,400
- You go first.
- You're all dirty.

725
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,240
I'll head off then.

726
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,320
Are you…

727
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,030
Are you all okay?

728
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,320
- I'll go get a first-aid kit.
- We're fine.

729
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,110
What on earth happened today?

730
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,400
There were like 30 girls watching me

731
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,240
play basketball.

732
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,400
Why did you start fighting?

733
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,480
- Yeah.
- Who started it?

734
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,800
Xiao Han.

735
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,480
Really?

736
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,440
You should've seen it.

737
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,000
Xiao Han was so fierce today.

738
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,480
Facing the thug leader,

739
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,670
Xiao Han grabbed

740
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,510
his neck.

741
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:44,150
They were several of them,

742
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,760
so I thought I'd just accept it.

743
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,400
I didn't expect Xiao Han

744
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,400
to fight three thugs for me.

745
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,800
When I saw that,

746
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:53,850
I got so fired up

747
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,880
and…

748
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,480
and I also jumped in.

749
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:59,880
It wasn't just for you.

750
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,440
I did it for myself too.

751
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,400
I was pissed off

752
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,800
and

753
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,480
need to vent.

754
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,670
Brother Xiao Han,

755
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,840
with your face like this,

756
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,000
how will you explain it?

757
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,960
I will tell the truth.

758
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:17,800
With bruises like this,

759
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,190
if I say I fell,

760
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,400
she wouldn't buy it.

761
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,280
So…

762
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,960
just say it like that?

763
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,960
Yeah. Fighting

764
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,550
and failing to make the Team,

765
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,510
which will shatter her image

766
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,150
of me,

767
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,360
her perfect son.

768
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,960
That's not too bad.

769
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,490
At least you don't have to be
the perfect kid all the time.

770
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:39,430
Come on.

771
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,360
- Quick, put it here.
- Thanks.

772
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,720
Grab some alcohol for disinfecting.

773
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:48,190
But speaking of it,

774
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,200
Jianfeng,

775
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,440
is it because you dress too flashy?

776
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,920
You look wealthy.

777
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:55,710
They've been on to you.

778
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:56,720
Got it?

779
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,150
Actually, my whole outfit,

780
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:00,030
clothes, pants, shoes, everything,

781
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,880
aren't bought from malls.

782
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,800
Qian Jiayue,

783
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,510
thanks for keeping my secret.

784
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,190
(Self-Reliance Scholarship Application Form)
There's a scholarship.

785
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,850
(No poor student should be left behind)
You should apply for it.

786
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,800
I don't need it.

787
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:22,590
Mr. Zhou said your family…

788
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:23,430
Thanks, though.

789
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:25,030
I'm off to play basketball.

790
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,150
My dad is on long-term sick leave.

791
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,670
My mom is laid off.

792
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,480
She sells tea eggs outside a company.

793
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,590
They've sent me to sports school
since I was little.

794
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,430
Maybe they hoped

795
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,230
I'd have a future path.

796
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:45,000
But I disappointed them.

797
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,710
High jump didn't work.

798
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,630
Sprints

799
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,840
didn't either.

800
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,800
In the end,

801
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,150
I switched to hurdles.

802
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:55,800
My classmates at my old school

803
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,070
all looked down on me.

804
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,360
I was afraid you would too.

805
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,760
So I bought these

806
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,030
from them.

807
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,030
So

808
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,230
you knew them before?

809
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:10,150
No, I didn't.

810
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,820
One day after school, I saw them

811
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,880
selling brand-name goods

812
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,840
at the school gate,

813
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,820
and claimed
they would sell them for 200,

814
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,610
but the original price were over 1,000

815
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:19,630
because they are stolen from a factory.

816
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,550
I couldn't resist.

817
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,430
I bought them

818
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,360
with money from my grandma.

819
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,550
I didn't dare tell my parents.

820
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,150
These aren't stolen at all.

821
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,190
They're fakes from Qipu Road.

822
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,190
200?

823
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,670
I wouldn't pay 50 for them.

824
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,070
And then what happened?

825
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:44,030
Then they blackmailed me,

826
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,670
saying I had to pay 1,200

827
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,840
for these clothes.

828
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,070
If I don't,

829
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,320
they'd report me to the school,

830
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,920
claiming I joined them,

831
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,480
in stealing from factories.

832
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,310
That's extortion.

833
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:58,630
So horrible.

834
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:59,470
Exactly.

835
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,360
Over a thousand.

836
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,670
Where did you get the money?

837
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:06,150
So…

838
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,070
So I…

839
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,880
So you acted on impulse...

840
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,630
Case solved!

841
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,240
You took the lunch money.

842
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,360
I regretted it soon after.

843
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:21,510
I'm sorry.

844
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,800
I'm so sorry.

845
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,800
Really sorry, everyone.

846
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,440
I already told them.

847
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,340
If they bother me again,

848
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:29,070
I have nothing to give but my life.

849
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,230
Kill me if they dare.

850
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,110
Next time, call the police.

851
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:31,950
That's right.

852
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,880
We'll stick together.

853
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,550
Together to school, together home.

854
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,030
If they come again,

855
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,000
we won't be afraid.

856
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:41,480
Yes, your issues are ours.

857
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,760
We'll always stick together.

858
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,960
Let's see who dares bully you.

859
00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:59,510
Thanks.

860
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,550
No need to thank us. Let's go.

861
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:02,710
Let's walk him home together.

862
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,550
- Okay.
- Let's go.

863
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,670
I have to return the first aid kit.

864
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,540
Hurry, or no time for self-reflection.

865
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,190
You two, hurry up.

866
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,320
Wait for me at the bike shed.

867
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,800
See you in a bit.

868
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,640
Chop chop.

869
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,480
That's my home.

870
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,030
It's really small,

871
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,920
so I won't invite you in.

872
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,110
I prefer staying up here.

873
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,000
The view here is amazing.

874
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,920
It looks like the world is vast.

875
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:31,630
Yeah, Hero Xiao.

876
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:34,670
Aren't you going to write a poem?

877
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,030
What hero?

878
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,390
Look over there.

879
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,030
Those tall buildings,

880
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,670
and those beautiful houses.

881
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,760
The river divides two worlds.

882
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,150
The real heroes

883
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,640
are over there.

884
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,760
Over there?

885
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,840
I think

886
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:03,550
my mom is a hero.

887
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,030
Because her tea eggs taste amazing.

888
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:10,590
Wanna try?

889
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:11,430
Me!

890
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,630
I want three.

891
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,190
Come on, Wang Bin, come with me.

892
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,320
I…

893
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,070
Xiao Han,

894
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,710
you and your father

895
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:31,870
are both heroes.

896
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,280
My dad often says

897
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:38,800
a person's worth

898
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,150
is defined by their choices,

899
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:43,910
not the final outcome.

900
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,760
No matter how times change,

901
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,360
this truth remains unchanged.

902
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:51,590
Yes, Chen Mo,

903
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:52,630
what you said was spot on.

904
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:55,630
I've been puzzled for a long time,

905
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,980
wondering if your dad's sacrifice
is worth it.

906
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,480
Though I don't have an answer.

907
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,280
Brother Xiao Han,

908
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,440
your father will always

909
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,010
be a hero in my heart.

910
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,840
I've always felt that way too.

911
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,230
When my grandparents were alive,

912
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:17,360
they always used your dad
to put down my dad.

913
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,230
To die for a cause,

914
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,280
to sacrifice for righteousness.

915
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,030
I keep my heart bright,

916
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,000
what more is there to say?

917
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:30,360
Are they lyrics from Modern Music?

918
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:31,760
Of course.

919
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,280
It contains everything.

920
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:35,960
Impressive!

921
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,230
- Truly impressive.
- Amazing.

922
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,150
Impressive!

923
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,760
Really impressive,

924
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:41,470
Loner Xiao.

925
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,480
Let me tell you

926
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,440
one of my favorite ways

927
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:57,360
- to release stress.
- Don't want to listen.

928
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,360
Just shout from here.

929
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,840
Shout out loud.

930
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,360
Really, just follow my lead.

931
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,200
