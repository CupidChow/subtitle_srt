00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,940
Guys,

25
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,540
(Integrity, Diligence, Responsibility, Virtue)
two things.

26
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,490
First,

27
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,820
(No. 2 Middle School)
everyone

28
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:45,960
must visit

29
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:46,940
the exam room.

30
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,240
Not just to know the route,

31
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,240
but also to

32
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,730
feel the exam environment

33
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,440
and the vibe.

34
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:54,880
Once you get familiar,

35
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,090
you won't feel nervous.

36
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,560
Second,

37
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,130
we only have two weeks left.

38
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:00,930
What are your plans?

39
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,290
- Review.
- Review.

40
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,160
That makes sense,

41
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,160
but you've been doing this for a year.

42
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,490
Do you really need more review?

43
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,170
Instead, I suggest

44
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,170
you relax a bit

45
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,610
for two weeks.

46
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,130
How about

47
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,090
open the fridge

48
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,490
and grab a green bean popsicle?

49
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,280
While eating it, you can imagine

50
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,210
you're sitting in the exam room.

51
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,450
You get the paper,

52
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:22,680
and you know

53
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,460
all the answers.

54
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,720
You get the results,

55
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,240
and you get into your dream school!

56
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,630
Okay!

57
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:29,710
Okay!

58
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,010
Okay!

59
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,490
What's this?

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,960
I told you before.

61
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,890
This is the Mental Victory Method.

62
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:41,840
- Yes!
- Yes!

63
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,240
For the past three years,

64
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,370
at No. 2 Middle School,

65
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,370
we've got rid of our childishness

66
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,770
and immaturity,

67
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,240
and gained maturity

68
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,680
and responsibility.

69
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,090
Teachers, thank you

70
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,180
for

71
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,460
teaching us with all your heart

72
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,900
and helping us enter adulthood

73
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,500
step by step.

74
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,340
My friends, thank you

75
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,340
for

76
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,060
inspiring us

77
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,660
in the dark,

78
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,140
motivating us

79
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,060
in solitude,

80
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,340
and warming us

81
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,420
in hardships.

82
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:40,860
What was

83
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,860
that about?

84
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,140
I didn't see the subtitles.

85
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,580
I didn't hear it.

86
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,350
It seems it was about

87
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,580
Long Xiaoyu's murder.

88
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,580
- I think so.
- How could we miss

89
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,300
such an important plot?

90
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,900
Can we turn up the volume a bit?

91
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,020
Just a little.

92
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,460
I don't think so.

93
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,460
Han's room isn't soundproof.

94
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,660
Will it distract him?

95
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,580
Just a little.

96
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,440
A little.

97
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,580
It won't affect him.

98
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,060
Enough.

99
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,300
Can't hear anything.

100
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,780
Alright. I'm turning it down.

101
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:22,900
Mao Tou.

102
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,980
Little imp, what are you doing?

103
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,820
You're making noises.

104
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,700
Want some water?

105
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,780
No, I don't!

106
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,900
You're being too loud.

107
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,900
This room

108
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,180
likes water.

109
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,620
Look,

110
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,900
do you have water?

111
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,540
That's not good.

112
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,100
It's bad for studying

113
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,180
and the eldest daughter.

114
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:24,620
Especially this.

115
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,730
This must be replaced.

116
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,650
What if I need to use the computer?

117
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:30,850
You can't replace it.

118
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:35,890
Have you finished?

119
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,610
If you're done, get out.

120
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:38,850
I need to study now.

121
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:41,690
This kid...

122
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:43,570
Sorry about that.

123

(Chen Mo's Mock Exams Data)

125
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,170

for all subjects

128
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,490
and made a complete analysis.

129
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,410
Look carefully.

130
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,530
Don't think only that person

131
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:36,610
can make plans.

132
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,490
I'm good at

00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,050
statistics too.

134
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,490
Did you write all this?

135
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,410
Why are you staring at me?

136
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:52,770
Look at the charts.

137
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,170
Let me take a look.

138
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,290
Look carefully.

139
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,370
There's a typo.

140
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,130
This one.

141
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,210
Let me see.

(Spotting Mistakes)
"Mu" is missing.

143
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,210
You're right.

144
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,490
I did this on purpose

145
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,130
to test your Chinese

146
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,170
language skills.

147
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,610
It seems you've mastered

148
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,050
Chinese well.

149
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:18,930
But that's not the point.

150
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,250
The point is this.

151
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,370
Look at your math.

152
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,490
I noticed the error rate

153
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,290
in basic math problems

154
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,370
is nearly 30 percent.

155
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:45,930
It's done.

00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,370
I can't believe

167

you've been lying to me.

feel dizzy.

No more nausea?

00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,050
I'm in. I'm in.

196
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,770
After we finish the exam,

197
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,170
you'll enter Grade 12.

198
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,890
You should start reviewing.

199
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:25,770
Here we go again.

200
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,010
Let's discuss

201
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,010
where to go.

202
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,090
Okay.

203
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:30,250
But

204
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,290
I need to fulfill a promise first.

205
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:34,730
What is it?

206
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,010
I'm going to meet Sailor.

207
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,440
The online friend you've

208
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,680
chatted with for three years?

209
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,520
Yes.

210
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,600
You've chatted with

211
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,040
someone online for three years?

212
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,800
It's been three years.

213
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,920
You must've hit it off.

214
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,680
Yes.

215
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,360
You couldn't meet him
for the last few times.

216
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,840
Who made the proposal

217
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,840
this time?

218
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,080
I asked him out.

219
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,320
What are you thinking?

220
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,920
Don't overthink it.

221
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,360
I really respect Sailor.

222
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,800
He has guided me

223
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,360
on many things.

224
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,960
He changed my view

225
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,280
of the world.

226
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,080
He also helped me

227
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,440
regain confidence

228
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,680
to pursue my dreams.

229
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,280
So,

230
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,320
I want to thank him in person

231
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,800
and

232
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,560
formally make friends with him.

233
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,840
Your thoughts are sincere.

234
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,320
But how do we know

235
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,320
what he's thinking?

236
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,080
Think about it.

237
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,920
How can an adult with a job

238
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,840
have so much time to chat with

239
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,200
a high schooler every day?

240
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,240
What if he's not busy at all?

241
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,440
Besides,

242
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,560
he doesn't even know if Qian Jiayue

243
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,560
is a beauty or not.

244
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,040
Online identities

245
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,320
can be made up.

246
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,520
What if

247
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,720
Qian Jiayue was

248
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,440
a rough guy pretending to be a girl?

249
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,080
You're a rough guy!

250
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,440
That's not the point.

251
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,160
The point is,

252
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,040
what if Sailor

253
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,720
is a rough guy?

254
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,440
No way.

255
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,720
Don't insult that term!

256
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,840
You don't act rough?

257
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,960
Qian Jiayue.

258
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,920
To be honest,

259
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,560
how did you know Sailor?

260
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,880
I remember

261
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,040
when I just

262
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,040
started school,

263
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,040
I was feeling a bit down,

264
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,760
so I chatted with him online.

265
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,240
He told me

266
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,280
to take a step back

267
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,800
to see a different world

268
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,640
and scenery.

269
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,920
That's how we started chatting.

270
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,040
So, at that time,

271
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,040
did you tell him

272
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,000
why you were upset?

273
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,400
No, I didn't.

274
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,640
Didn't he ask why?

275
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,520
No, he didn't.

276
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,760
You didn't say it,

277
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,800
and he didn't ask,

278
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,160
but he knew what you needed.

279
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,400
Don't you think

280
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,920
he already knew

281
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,440
why you were upset?

282
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,660
Has he ever told you about

283
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,900
the specific work

284
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,660
he did every day?

285
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,380
What's his boss like?

286
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,620
Has he faced

287
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,020
any challenges at work?

288
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:17,860
No.

289
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,280
So,

290
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,240
I know the truth.

291
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,140
It must be someone around you.

292
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:33,900
So,

293
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,050
he just made up an identity

294
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,290
to chat with you online.

295
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,590
Well,

296
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,440
he...

297
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,480
I get it!

298
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,680
Could it be your mom?

299
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,260
Baby.

300
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,300
You don't want me to read your diaries,

301
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,060
but you've told me

302
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,060
everything,

303
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,140
haven't you?

304
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,140
Impossible.

305
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,860
When I chatted with Sailor,

306
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,500
my mom was often in the living room.

307
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:10,820
It can't be her.

308
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,100
Could it be Pei Dongni?

309
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,140
Five Principles, Four Beauties,
and Three Loves.

310
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,660
Material progress
and cultural and ethical progress.

311
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,300
Qian Jiayue,

312
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,620
are you surprised?

313
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,300
Yes, it's me.

314
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,380
It's me.

315
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,380
As the class leader,

316
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,140
I must find a way

317
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,540
to guide you toward the right path.

318
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,140
Impossible.

319
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,330
I don't think she's capable

320
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,250
of saying those words.

321
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:45,970
Then,

322
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,210
could it be

323
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:49,250
Loner Xiao?

324
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:51,600
- No.
- No.

325
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,230
I think I can analyze this for you.

326
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,470
Think about it.

327
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,710
If Sailor really is

328
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,750
someone around you,

329
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,190
he must be someone

330
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,470
who cares about you

331
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,710
a lot.

332
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,350
That makes sense.

333
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,350
Right?

334
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,510
So...

335
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,240
- Summarize it.
- This person

336
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,250
has a computer,

337
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,370
has lots of free time,

338
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,250
cares about Qian Jiayue,

339
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:22,250
Think about it.

340
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:25,860
Mao Tou.

341
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,460
Stop kidding.

342
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,020
I'm not kidding.

343
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,540
I know the truth.

344
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,500
- Chang Wuji!
- Chang Wuji!

345
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,510
Wuji,

346
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,150
I feel sorry for you!

347
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,590
Stop the nonsense.

348
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,310
Just tell us.

349
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,990
Do you guys usually

350
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,110
talk about Chang Wuji?

351
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,110
About what?

352
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,350
Like chatting online.

353
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,590
Chang Wuji doesn't chat online.

354
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,550
Do you know his QQ number?

355
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,990
I told you it wasn't him.

356
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:05,910
Thanks.

357
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,070
Let's go.

358
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:07,950
Wait a moment.

359
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,630
I know

360
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,350
something about

361
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:16,350
Qian Jiayue.

362
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,350
Because you think

363
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,070
Qian Jiayue is the prettiest girl.

364
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,110
Then why don't you like

365
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,990
being with her alone?

366
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,270
When I'm with her alone,

367
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,590
she doesn't seem at ease.

368
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,590
She can't say things

369
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:32,830
she wants to say.

370
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,910
But when she's with Ka Men and Chen Mo,

371
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:36,910
she feels at ease.

372
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,390
So,

373
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,270
I prefer being with everyone.

374
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,070
How do you feel about her?

375
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,230
I mean, inside your heart.

376
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,830
If she's happy, I'll be happy.

377
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:51,990
It doesn't matter.

378
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:55,830
This is a big deal!

379
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,150
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

380
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,230
Chang Wuji didn't allow us to tell you.

381
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:00,670
He said

382
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,670
if Jiayue found out,

383
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,030
she'd feel awkward.

384
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,720
Do you know?

385
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,240
(Sailor)
Your birthstone is moonstone.

386
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,700
Is this a moonstone?

387
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,000
It's June's lucky stone.

388
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,940
I hope it brings you luck.

389
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,450
But now you're telling us.

390
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,830
You asked me, right?

391
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,050
Either way,

392
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,010
I'm wrong,

393
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:20,530
right?

394
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:21,970
What do you really want?

395
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:23,290
We've told you

396
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:25,330
Qian Jiayue has an online friend
of three years.

397
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:26,530
They'll meet after the exam.

398
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:27,530
We think that person

399
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:28,370
is Chang...

400
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:30,770
Is it you?

401
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:35,610
That's right.

402
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:36,970
It's me.

403
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,170
Jiayue,

404
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,010
I've never had the courage to tell you.

405
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:41,850
My name isn't Wang Bin.

406
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,610
I'm Wang You.
[*Online friend]

407
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:46,610
Bad joke.

408
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:49,770
So,

409
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:52,050
you think that online friend

410
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,290
is Chang Wuji.

411
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,250
It's easy.

412
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:05,690
Chang Wuji!

413
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:10,810
Sailor?

414
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,090
Why would I use Sailor?

415
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,770
My QQ nickname is Chang Wuji.

416
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:21,610
See for yourself.

417
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:22,450
It's not him.

418
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,290
But Qian Jiayue,

419
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,090
don't meet online friends.

420
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:29,610
Meeting online friends?

421
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,490
I saw it on the news yesterday.

422
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,090
Some impersonated online friends

423
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,930
and scammed a lot of money.

424
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:38,730
There are many bad people online now.

425
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,530
I don't think it will happen.

426
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:45,770
I've chatted with Sailor
for three years,

427
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,530
and he's helped me a lot.

428
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,010
I don't think he's a bad person.

429
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:58,060
(Bookstore, Park)

430
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,860
(Wonton Shop)

431
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,660
(Reed: Are you there?)

432
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:19,940
Yes.

433
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,500
The College Entrance Exam is coming, right?

434
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,780
You're still online.

435
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,180
Our class advisor said

436
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,020
reviewing wouldn't help

437
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,220
in the last two weeks.

438
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,900
(Sailor)
Oh.

439
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,100
Something funny happened today.

440
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,700
I was talking with my friends

441
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,020
about meeting you after the exam.

442
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,660
They told me to be cautious

443
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,020
in case you're a scammer.

444
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,540
So, are you worried I'm a bad person?

445
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,780
Of course not.

446
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,700
Why would a bad guy
help me for three years?

447
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,780
The cost is too high.

448
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,620
However,

449
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,780
I was worried

450
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,260
that you are

451
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,660
someone around me.

452
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,780
Why were you worried?

453
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,740
For me,

454
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:27,940
over the years,

455
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:28,940
you've become

456
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,220
a very important friend.

457
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,660
We're the closest strangers now.

458
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,740
Our lives don't intersect,

459
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,700
so I can tell you anything

460
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,700
without any burden.

461
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,260
If I suddenly found out

462
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,980
you were someone I know,

463
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,500
it'd feel like

464
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,460
my mom has been reading my diary.

465
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,580
Are you

466
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,820
Sailor who chats

467
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,660
with Reed?

468
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,260
Chang Wuji.

469
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,540
So, it's you.

470
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,340
How did you know?

471
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,540
I just searched

472
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,540
all the Sailors online

473
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,100
with IP addresses in Shanghai.

474

481
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:40,490
Hello.

482
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:42,610
I'm your online friend Reed's classmate.

483
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,370
I just want to make sure

484
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,290
you're not a bad person.

485
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:50,610
Of course not.

486
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,360
I heard you're a magazine editor.

487
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,760
So, are you working

488
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,320
for a magazine?

489
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,200
Yes.

490
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,560
Our office has computers.

491
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,800
Is that strange?

492
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,400
Alright.

493
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:05,960
I'm checking your IP.

494
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,600
The results are coming.

495
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,800
Stop.

496
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,120
Okay.

497
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,560
Now that I know you're Sailor,

498
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,400
you're not

499
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,320
a bad person, right?

500
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,320
I'm relieved now.

501
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,400
I'm leaving.

502
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,800
Wait, wait! Come back.

503
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,640
You're leaving?

504
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,800
Is there anything else?

505
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,560
Chang Wuji.

506
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,240
Will you tell Qian Jiayue

507
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,520
that I'm Sailor?

508
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,160
Well,

509
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,880
do you want me to tell her?

510
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,640
Then,

511
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,560
do you think I should

512
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,920
tell her?

513
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,800
Do you think it's necessary to tell her?

514
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,400
I think...

515
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,040
I'm asking you, right?

516
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,880
I think...

517
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,800
I think

518
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,640
it's

519
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,040
up to you.

520
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,200
Forget it. You...

521
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,040
You can go.

522
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,640
I don't know

523
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,080
if you should tell her.

524
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:34,920
But

525
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,400
I can feel

526
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,880
Sailor

527
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,880
is quite important

528
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,480
to Qian Jiayue.

529
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,310
Why are you lying here?

530
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,580
My dad said my breathing

531
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,540
was too loud,

532
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,820
and Xiao Han needed to study,

533
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,820
so he kicked me out.

534
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,140
What brings you here?

535
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,340
I remember I put

536
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,260
a scrapbook here.

537
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,660
I'm looking for it.

538
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,780
Take your time.

539
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,220
(Reading Is Beneficial)

540
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,140
Found it.

541
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,580
Mao Tou,

542
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,500
do you know?

543
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,980
You did me a big favor

544
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,260
by chance.

545
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,070
What is it?

546
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,140
On my last birthday,

547
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,300
you took a photo of Brother Xiao Han

548
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,460
and me.

549
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,380
It put an end

550
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,580
to a story.

551
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,660
Anyway, it's all in the past.

552
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:06,820
I'll tell you,

553
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,100
but don't laugh at me.

554
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,220
I promise I won't.

555
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,380
Actually,

556
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,140
for a long time,

557
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,580
I had special feelings

558
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,140
about Brother Xiao Han.

559
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,140
You know.

560
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,860
But looking back,

561
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,380
he never shared

562
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,180
his thoughts with me.

563
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,220
I didn't know

564
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,540
why he was happy,

565
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,380
and I didn't know

566
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,980
how to comfort him when he was upset.

567
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,740
He's a brother, and

568
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:44,980
I'm her little sister.

569
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,460
It seems

570
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,740
we're meant to be like this.

571
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,100
The three of us

572
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,420
have grown up together.

573
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,660
Brother Xiao Han has been good to me

574
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,900
because

575
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,140
I'm her sister, just like

576
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,220
you're my little brother.

577
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,380
So, we can never be

578
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,820
more than that in the first place.

579
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,660
Do you think I'm foolish?

580
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,860
It's okay if you do.

581
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,140
It doesn't matter

582
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,660
because it's in the past.

583
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,180
This solo act

584
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,180
should come to an end.

585
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,060
I suddenly remembered

586
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,300
something a friend online said.

587
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,620
It's time

588
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,980
to embrace the new world.

589
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,460
Mao Tou,

590
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,380
you should embrace your new world too.

591
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,180
Next year, it'll be your turn.

592
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,620
Who told you

593
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,140
all this nonsense?

594
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,220
Goodbye.

595
00:26:59,140 --> 00:26:59,980
Mao Tou,

596
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,300
I'm very grateful

597
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,180
that you two have treated me

598
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,340
like family in my youth.

599
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,740
Good luck.

600
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,420
Because

601
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,580
I'm her sister, just like

602
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,660
you're my little brother.

603
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,580
Mao Tou

604
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,020
I'm very grateful

605
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,900
that you two have treated me

606
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,820
like family in my youth.

607
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,180
Chang Wuji,

608
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,020
let's meet again.

609
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,420
(Chang Wuji)

610
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,180
Please

611
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,940
keep this secret for me.

612
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,500
You mean,

613
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,260
don't tell her

614
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,500
before you meet?

615
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,700
Never.

616
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,020
Never tell her.

617
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:40,980
Why?

618
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,020
As you said,

619
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,740
Sailor is important to her.

620
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,460
I don't want to reveal it.

621
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,540
I don't want to

622
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,740
turn a small regret

623
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,060
of not meeting an online friend

624
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:57,900
into a

625
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,180
big regret.

626
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,060
Do you mean

627
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,860
Sailor will just

628
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,740
disappear?

629
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,500
Sailor

630
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,900
will leave her a QQ message

631
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:17,820
that

632
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,860
he was transferred to another city.

633
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,100
Maybe Tibet

634
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,500
or abroad.

635
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,060
Or maybe

636
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,220
the magazine office

637
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,620

638
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,660
Anyway,

639
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,100

640
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,180

She is

a fragile person,

647
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,100
so fragile

648
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,060
that she always doubts herself.

649
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,620
She thinks

650
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,780
she's bad at

She can't meet Sailor,

so I want to find a way

654

someone who

660
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,980
cares about her will show up

661
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,100

681
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,560
Wrap it up.

Remember,

00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,600

Chen Xiu'e,

687
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,840
enough for these superstitions, okay?

688
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,240
It's driving me crazy.

689
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,720
Have you thought about it?

690
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,280
The exam is tomorrow.

691
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,720
It'll be over

692
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,080
in three days.

693
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,960
After the summer vacation,

694
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,240
our kids will go to

695
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,240
universities,

696
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,520
and we'll be empty nesters.

697
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,640
We'll be empty nesters.

698
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,960
The kids have grown up.

699
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,880
They must spread their wings and fly.

700
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,160
Luckily,

701
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,200
my baby

702
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,960
won't fly far.

703
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,800
Won't fly.

704
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,360
Won't fly far?

705
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,600
Even if she's not far away,

706
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,000
she won't have time for you.

707
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,720
Once she goes to university,

708
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,480
her life will be amazing.

709
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,560
Even if she comes home on weekends,

710
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,680
she'll only ask you to do the laundry.

711
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,960
There's an Empty Nest Talisman, right?

712
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,440
Which deity is in charge of that?

713
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,080
I'll go and get one.

714
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,400
I'll get one

715
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,120

716
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,600
Yes, there is.

717

719
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,800
Okay?

720
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,400
The weather is so hot now.

721
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,760
The AC Talisman can keep us cool.

722
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,000
I mean it.

723
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,200
And there's

724
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,560
Never-Grow-Up Talisman.

725
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,600
- Never grow up.
- Yes.

726
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,000
And Control Talisman.

727
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,040
You can keep her around.

728
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,280
- Or let her
- Amazing.

729
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,440
stay away from you.

737

I really don't want it.

738
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,560

you can hold it.

00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,720
I let you down.

771
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,520
Momo,

772
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,240
is your admission ticket ready?

773
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,760
Yes, it's ready. Check it.

774
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,800
Okay.

775
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,440
Okay, when you get the Chinese paper...

776
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,360
Look at the essay topic and think it over.

777
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,360
You've told me many times.

778
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,560
Choice questions?

779
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,600
Choice questions.

780
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,480
Eliminate the wrong ones.

781
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,240
As the old saying goes,

782
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,960
"Despise the enemy strategically

783
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,360
but be serious tactically."

784
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,560
- Okay.
- Momo,

785
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,920
- are you ready?
- Here, take this.

786
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,920
It's time to go.

787
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,880
Let's go.

788
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,760
We're leaving.

789
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,680
Let's go.

790
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,560
Momo.

791
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,720
Clear your mind.

792
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,120
Feel at ease.

793
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,760
Don't worry, Comrade Chen.

794
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:29,960
We're leaving.

795
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,560
Let's go.
