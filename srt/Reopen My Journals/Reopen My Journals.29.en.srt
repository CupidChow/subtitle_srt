(Jiale Wontons)
Liquor and tobacco store.

26
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,770
Smart.

27
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,370
What are we doing now?

28
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:45,410
Watching soccer.

29
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,090
I want to blow the whistle.

30
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,650
Mom, you can't.
The whistle is for referees.

31
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,400
They can't hear it on the field.
Blow it if you want.

32
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,490
You might disturb others.

33
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,280
(Jiale Wontons)
Look,

34
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,880
Chairwoman Liao is here.

35
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,000
Please take a seat.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,010
Dagui saved you a seat.

37
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,210
Which one do you want?

38
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,360
Mom.

39
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,020
- One.
- One.

40
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,880
Two.

41
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,440
Four.

42
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:05,800
- Hurry, which one?
- This one.

43
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,640
There?

44
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,550
Alright.

45
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,680
Take it slow.

46
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,890
Sister, nice to meet you.

47
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,400
- It's so lively.
- Yeah, it is.

48
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,890
Everyone's here for the photos.

49
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,370
You can buy a photo

50
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,650
of this famous player outside

51
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,090
or print an autographed one yourself.

52
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,930
An autograph? That's good.

53
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,840
Honey, sit down. Sit down.

54
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,490
Don't embarrass us, okay?

55
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,370
This autographed photo

56
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,520
is from Zhang Qiming, right?

57
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,360
Yes.

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,560
Chairwoman Liao is here.

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,960
Enjoy your meal.

60
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,210
You look beautiful today.

61
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,210
When did you become a fan

62
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,240
and come to watch the game?

63
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,170
My mom loves watching games.

64
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,280
She asked,
"Where are Jianjun and Jianguo

65
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,400
going to watch games
if they're not at home?"

66
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,520
She wanted to see them,

67
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,000
so we had to bring her here.

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,840
Right?

69
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,680
It's quite nice.

70
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,000
Let Jiayue be at home

71
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,610
and do her homework in peace.

72
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,170
(David Beckham)
Chairwoman Liao,

73
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,170
what do you want to eat or drink today?

74
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,490
No, nothing.

75
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,400
How can you not eat?

76
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,210
Signed in Chinese.
Zhang Qiming, you're good.

77
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,170
Today, let's boost her business.

78
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,010
Two combo meals.

79
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,720
That's a lot of money.

80
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,650
Tell me about it.

81
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,960
Pei, Pei.

82
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,050
Coming. Wait a moment.

83
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:13,890
Please enjoy.

84
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:14,840
Just in time. Mom.

85
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,880
Take a look.

86
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,050
You know those stars, right?

87
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,450
(Crystal Palace Shield, Fan Zhiyi)
General Fan.

88
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,610
- Professional.
- Smart.

89
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,090
(50 Yuan Soccer Combo)
I don't know this foreigner.

90
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,720
I know this person.

91
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:23,960
Little San.

92
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,450
Right?

93
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,490
Mom,

94
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,800
who am I?

95
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,890
You're Nanny.

96
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,120
- Mr. Driver,
- I'm still "Nanny".

97
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,560
why aren't you driving?

98
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,920
It's hot outside.

99
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,370
I'm just cooling off with the AC.

100
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,210
I'm looking for you.

101
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,370
What's with

102
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,330
the autographed photo?

103
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,170
Beckham can write Chinese.

104
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:44,090
- Chen.
- Is that surprising?

105
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,050
Mr. Chen.

106
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,650
- Please come in.
- Mr. Chen.

107
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,560
You're a rare guest.

108
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,400
So many female fans.

109
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,330
They're all here for the autograph.

110
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:53,650
Really?

111
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,210
Yes, it's true.

112
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,450
- Really?
- Yes, yes.

113
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,450
Mr. Chen, please come in.

114
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,330
Have a seat here.

115
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,560
Not sure if they understand the game,

116
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,120
but they're keen on celebrities.

117
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,960
Exactly.

118
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,840
Men love beauties,

119
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,770
and women love hotties.

120
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:07,610
That's quite normal.

121
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,890
- Some people bought
- Chen.

122
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,500
several meal sets

123
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,660
to win this

124
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,520
- autographed photo.
- Pei.

125
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,770
- Have a seat.
- Fangfang.

126
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,560
Give me two Soccer Sets.

127
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:17,720
Can you finish two sets?

128
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,600
Finishing isn't important.

129
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,530
What matters is

130
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,480
Beckham's autograph.

131
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,010
Chen, join us for some cold beer.

132
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,010
Sure.

133
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:32,850
I'll go get it for you.

134
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,960
I heard your wife likes David Beckham.

135
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,010
She told me yesterday

136
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,280
she likes Luis Figo.

137
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,940
- Long time no see.
- You like

138
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,440
autographs, don't you?

139
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:52,460
(Workbook)

140
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,320
Cross the ball.

141
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,240
Cross it.

142
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:55,570
Cross it now.

143
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,020
Now China's RWF holds the ball.

144
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,060
He fakes a move, then suddenly starts.

145
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,600
Danger, danger.

146
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,440
Save it, save it!

147
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,450
Save it!

148
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,400
That was so close, just a bit.

149
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,280
What is the defense doing?

150
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,010
He can't run back.

151
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:24,090
He can't even run.

152
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,360
He must be out of stamina.

153
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,250
It's the second half.

154
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,450
What kind of excuse is that?

155
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,010
They are professional athletes, right?

156
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,010
Back when I was young,

157
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,720
I picked up two baskets
of sweet potatoes,

158
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,890
walked eight kilometers,

159
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,650
and didn't even break a sweat.

160
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,960
I've long said

161
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,400
that the Chinese team
will lose due to stamina.

162
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,480
Lack of stamina is a critical weakness.

163
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,810
Luck's on our side.

164
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:45,960
If we drew Group A,

165
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,570
we'd hit the ceiling.

166
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:48,650
Yes, yes.

167
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,770
We dodged Iran and Saudi Arabia.

168
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,360
Our luck's pretty good.

169
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,010
What's luck anyway? Tell me.

170
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,210
How far can they go with luck?

171
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,050
How far, really?

172
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,090
There are strong teams in Group B, too.

173
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,690
I don't think

174
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,130
we can beat Uzbekistan today.

175
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,770
That move was really risky.

176
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,600
We are definitely winning today!

177
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,210
Xiu'e, you don't understand.
Why do you call?

178
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,280
Why don't I understand?

179
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,450
Bing from the market said

180
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,690
it's a sure win today.

181
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:13,650
Stop it.

182
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,890
You listen to the news

183
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,040
when buying stocks, not watching games.

184
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,250
- So strange.
- Go away.

185
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,760
You're strange.

186
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,840
It's all your fault

187
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,650
for having the World Cup Set.

188
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,250
Watching games has become so easy now.

189
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,210
That's right. Women watch soccer

190
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,050
based on looks.

191
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,600
Whoever is handsome, they'll watch.

192
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,770
What do they know about soccer?

193
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,600
- Go away.
- Watch your words.

194
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,010
- What did you say?
- At least you're watching.

195
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:33,920
Exactly.

196
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,280
We've bought the sets, after all.

197
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,120
Indeed.

198
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,360
Here's the chance!

It's fine.

203
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:33,650
Everyone, clear the way.

204
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:34,940
(Jiale Wontons)
Make way.

205
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:35,840
Call for help!

206
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,160
- Hurry, call!
- Call now!

207
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,400
Qian Kang, what do we do?

208
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:40,650
Is everything okay?

(Operating room)

211
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,440
Xiu'e,

212
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,730
- how is it?
- Mom,

213
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:02,730
where's Granny?

214
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,010
She's in surgery right now.

215
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,700
(Operating room)
How is it?

216
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,570
She's just been anesthetized.

217
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,090
It'll be at least another half hour.

218
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,650
The surgery will take four hours.

219
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,320
It's okay.

220
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,850
Don't cry.

221
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,010
It'll be alright.

222
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,760
No crying.

223
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,770
Granny will be fine.

227
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:36,960
It's alright.

Qian Kang.

229
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,730
- Qian Kang.
- You're here.

230
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,510
- How's it going?
- Still in surgery.

231
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,360
How is it going?

232
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,560
- It should be fine.
- Xiu'e.

233
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,040
Don't worry. Stay calm.

234
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,330
Xiu'e.

235
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,280
Everything will be fine.

236
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:00,920
- Don't worry.
- It's okay.

237
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,370
- It's okay.
- I'll check on Xiu'e.

238
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,390
Alright, alright.

239
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,200
Xiu'e,

240
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,770
stay calm.

241
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:08,690

You're back.

245
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:26,490
I bought some congee and water.

246
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,500
Thank you.

247
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,730
- Take two cans.
- Jiayue, have some.

248
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,680
Don't go hungry.

249
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,840
Have one yourself.

250
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,490
Here you go.

251
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,840
- You take one too.
- Drink a bit.

252
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,610
I'll put it here.

253
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,610
It's okay, Jiayue.

254
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,880
Han,

255
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,650
why don't you three go home first?

256
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,890
You've got classes tomorrow.

257
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,250
We've got it covered here.

258
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,440
Yeah, you three

259
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,290
can't do much here for now,

260
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,290
so I'll drive you home.

261
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,560
No need.

262
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,530
Stay with Xiu'e instead.

263
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,890
- I'll go.
- No need.

264
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,010
I'll take them back.

265
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,610
You all stay here.

Come on.

Let's head back.

270
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,960
Go.

271
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,360
It's fine.

272
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,480
We're here.

273
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,240
I'll call you if anything happens.

Hello?

278
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,200
How did it go?

279
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,970
It worked.

280
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,010
Granny's surgery was successful!

281
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,440
That's wonderful.

282
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,200
I told you it'd be fine.

283
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,280
That's great.

284
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,330
Granny's fine.

285
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,010
It worked.

286
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:11,730
Let's go.

287
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,040
Brother Xiao Han,

288
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,040
back when your dad...

289
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,610
were you scared?

290
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,680
When Dad had his accident,

291
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,280
I was only five or six.

292
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,560
That day, my uncle suddenly came
to pick me up.

293
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,320
I remember it vividly.

294
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,680
A minibus arrived,

295
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:55,730
filled with relatives.

296
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,800
I thought

297
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,300
we were going on a trip,

298
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,220
so I hopped onto it and asked,

299
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,250
"Where are we going?"

300
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,250
No one told me.

301
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,520
Then

302
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,890
I was taken directly
to the memorial service.

303
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,040
The room was

304
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,560
full of crying people.

305
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,400
Dad's photo was hanging in the middle.

306
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,650
I wondered

307
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,080
why they hung his photo.

308
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:25,970
Then I was picked up

309
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:26,810
and walked to the middle.

310
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,730
At that time, I saw it.

311
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,680
I saw him lying there,

312
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,330
not moving.

313
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,560
Back then, I didn't know

314
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,440
what death meant.

315
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,560
But at that moment,

316
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,080
I suddenly cried.

317
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,610
I had

318
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:10,450
a dream once.

319
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,400
I dreamed about my grandparents.

320
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,040
It seemed like

321
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,370
Dad was driving us somewhere fun.

322
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,200
I sat in the passenger seat,

323
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,490
and they were in the back.

324
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,010
All the way there, he kept

325
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,730
criticizing me, saying I was bad

326
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,610
at this or that.

327
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:26,800
I got annoyed.

328
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,920
I wondered why he was so nagging.

329
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,200
Then it hit me

330
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:34,610
that I was dreaming.

331
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,250
My grandparents

332
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:39,890
were long gone.

333
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,880
I desperately

334
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:45,920
reminded myself,

335
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,760
"Don't wake up.

336
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,010
I shouldn't

337
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:48,890
wake up".

338
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,320
I was afraid that if I woke up,

339
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,520
I wouldn't

340
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,650
be able to hear them talk

341
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,040
or nag me

342
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:00,490
anymore.

343
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:08,570
Don't think about it.

344
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:10,490
Anyway,

345
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,130
no matter

346
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:13,440
what happens,

347
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,610
we'll stay with Jiayue.

348
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,400
Let's go home.

349
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,740
(Silence. Please keep quiet.)

350
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,280
- Slow down, slow down.
- Slow down!

- Mom.
- You're awake.

00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,460
Did we win?

362
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:34,630
We won! We won!

363
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,340
We won.

364
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,340
We just have a minor issue.

365
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,700
We're in the hospital.

we can go out and watch games again,

right?

369
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,100
It'll be fine.

370
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,820
Just rest.

371
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,740
Got it.

No rush. Take your time.

Okay, we'll hang up now.

377
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,700

378
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,700
have some water.

379
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,340
What did Jianjun say?

00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,660
Can his plane take off?

381
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,220
No flights are available.

382
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,180
It's pouring.

383
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,940
- He and Jianguo decided to rent a car
- Not drinking anymore?

384
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,660
and drive six hours to something-burg,

385
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,700
and catch a flight there.

386
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,620
Mom,

387
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,860
did you hear that?

388
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,500
Your sons

389
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,180
have already rebooked their flights.

390
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,620
They'll be back

391
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,740
in about ten hours.

392
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,740
They'll be back soon.

393
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,140
Did you hear that?

394
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,020
Xiu'e,

395
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,060
Kang,

396
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,740
let's discuss it.

397
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,980
We're at the door.

398
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,980
I heard you rented a hotel.

399
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:17,740
No need for that.

400
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,580
If Jianjun and Jianguo come,

401
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,860
you can stay in my old house.

402
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,380
Don't say that.

403
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,940
I already bothered you
last time they came back.

404
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:23,860
That's right.

405
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,420
Stop it.

406
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,700
I've called her Mom too.

407
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,700
Granny, would you like some more water?

408
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,020
No?

409
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,380
What's wrong?

410
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,220
What?

411
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,740
Granny, take your time to speak.

412
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,060
Mom.

413
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,380
Mom!

414
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,380
Come in quickly.

415
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,700
What is Granny saying?

416
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,020
I can't quite hear her.

417
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,980
Let me listen.

418
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,740
What are you saying?

419
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,300
Mom.

420
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,940
Jiangxi.

421
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,460
What Jiangxi?

422
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,940
Jiangxi.

423
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:14,950
Kang.

424
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:15,940
Jiang...

425
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,340
Is Auntie talking to you?

426
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,380
Mom, are you calling me?

427
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,540
Jiayue,

428
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,180
Granny is calling you.

429
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,060
Granny,

430
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,420
I'm here.

431
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,540
I think

432
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,500
she's saying sorry.

433
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,380
I heard that too.

434
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,220
Granny,

435
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,020
are you saying sorry?

436
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,420
Why are you

437
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,460
saying sorry to me?

438
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,700
You're so young.

439
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,660
Alright, alright.

440
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,620
You're going to Jiangxi.

441
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,460
Baby.

442
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,180
Don't talk anymore.

443
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,620
You're so young,

444
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,500
yet you're going to Jiangxi.

445
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,940
It breaks my heart.

446
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,340
I'm sorry.

447
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,180
Granny, I didn't go to Jiangxi.

448
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,780
Jiayue.

449
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,420
Granny mistook you for Mom.

450
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,380
Take good care of yourself.

451
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,180
Sweetie.

452
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,900
Don't blame...

453
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,260
Don't blame me.

454
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:32,860
Take care of yourself.

455
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,740
I'm sorry...

456
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,980
Mom, Jianjun has a stomachache.

457
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,180
A stomachache? How come?

458
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,180
Xiu'e, hurry up.

459
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,660
Mom, hurry up.

460
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,460
Mom, hurry up!

461
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,860
Take care of yourself.

462
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,620
Brothers and sisters!

463
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,700
Fellow workers!

My speech ends here.

(Fourth Staff Council)
But

466
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,660
before I finish,
I want to share a passage

467
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,740
with you all.

468
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,020
This passage

469
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,540
is from the Soviet writer

470
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,500
Ostrovsky.

471
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,420
He wrote,

472
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,260
"A person's dearest

473
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,660
possession

474
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,940
is life.

475
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,220
It is given

476
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,740
only once,

477
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,340
and one must live it

478
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,500
so as to feel

479
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,500
no torturing regrets

480
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,260
for wasted years,

481
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,460
never know

482
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,660
the burning shame

483
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,380
of a mean and petty past.

484
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,620
So live that,

485
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,940
when dying,

486
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,460
they might say,

487
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,620
'all my life,

488
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,940
all my strength

489
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,940
were given

490
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,940

Jianjun and Jianguo's flight is at noon.

534
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,860
He went to the airport to see them off.

535
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,300
Little imp, what are you folding here?

536
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,740
Han folded this quite well.

537
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,940
Jiayue, the middle part should pop out.

538
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,780
If not,

539
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,860
it won't look like a yuanbao.

540
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,980
I'll show you how to fold it.

541
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,100
Take two sheets.

542
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,060
Like this.

543
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:28,820
Then like this.

544
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,820
The front and back

545
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,220
are all together.

546
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,460
Baby, don't listen to him.

547
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,100
He's an amateur.

548
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,340
He grew up a wild card.

549
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,820
Yes,

550
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,260
I am wild.

551
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,540
Auntie liked my wildness

552
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,100
that she took me as her godson.

553
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,300
Mom did it

554
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,060
for the sake of your dad, okay?

555
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,780
When you were a kid,

556
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,380
every time you took Jianjun
and Jianguo out,

557
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,060
you got into trouble.

558
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,100
Do you remember?

559
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,300
Once,

560
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,180
you took us to Xujiahui.

561
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,940
On the way back,

562
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:22,780
we ran into a dog

563
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,540
that was this big

564
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,500
and black.

565
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,620
And you dare to say?

566
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,140
It's all her fault.

567
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,140
She ate a chicken leg

568
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,460
from Putuo District to Xuhui District.

569
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,180
She didn't eat it well,

570
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,180
just swinging around.

571
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,340
The dog came out all of a sudden.

572
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,700
Your uncles were so scared

573
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,740
that they scrambled away.

574
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:46,980
Your mom was brave.

575
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,220
She rushed up and helped me

576
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,180
fight the dog.

577
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,540
Mao Tou, do you know?

578
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,740
Then your father was careless,

579
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,700
and with a thud,

580
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,780
he tumbled into the gutter

581
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,060
over there.

582
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,700
How dare you say that?

583
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,540
Not only did your mom not save me,

584
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,620
but she was eating that chicken leg

585
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,660
and laughing.

586
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,020
I choked on the water

587
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,300
in the gutter.

588
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,540
I couldn't get the smell off

589
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,020
for three days.

590
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,260
You were lucky.

591
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,780
You just had to take a shower.

592
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,300
When I got back,

593
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,540
I saw Mom

594
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,620
with a broom,

595
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,780
chasing after me to beat me.

596
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,860
She said it was because

597
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,380
I almost let Little San

598
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,820
drown in the gutter.

599
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,740
At that moment,

600
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,620
I ran from upstairs to downstairs
in one breath,

601
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:37,860
and then

602
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,500
I ran around the yard

603
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,020
in a circle,

604
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,260
which wore Mom out.

605
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,540
Jiayue, you don't know.

606
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,820
Your granny was fierce
when she was young.

607
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,300
She spoke with

608
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,180
such strong authority,

609
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,860
full of righteous spirit.

610
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,460
Righteous? Really?

611
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,020
That's because she wasn't hitting you.

612
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,820
Baby,

613
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,020
Granny

614
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,260
is really patient with you,

615
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,540
much more than us.

616
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,940
That's inter-generational love.

617
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,540
It's natural for her.

618
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,980
You're not here,
and neither are Jianjun nor Jianguo.

619
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,620
When Jiayue finally came back,

620
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,300
she had to be treated well.

621
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,860
I always wondered

622
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,500
why Granny suddenly
started calling me Sweetie

623
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,060
instead of Baby.

624
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,860
It turned out she mistook me for Mom.

625
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,460
In the end,

626
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,940
Granny didn't remember me at all.

627
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,700
Mao Tou,

628
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,780
didn't we say we'd go to

629
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,780
that place today?

630
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,140
Jiayue,

631
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,780
why don't you come with us later?

632
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,380
Go.

633
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,700
We're here at home.

634
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,020
(Yingmo Community)
What do you want to play in the park?

635
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:51,860
Sign up now.

636
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,820
I want to play

637
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:54,980
the Flying Chair Ride.

638
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,180
Flying Chair Ride.

639
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,500
- What else?
- I want to ride the Carousel.

640
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,620
I want it too.

641
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,020
I want to play

642
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,820
Pirate Ship Ride.

643
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,820
Great, Pirate Ship Ride.

644
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,780
I want some cotton candy.

645
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,260
What is this?

646
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,620
It's a Carousel.

647
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,860
- Mao Tou knows it's a Carousel.
- A little one.

648
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,260
Did your dad bring you here?

649
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,100
Baby.

650
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,100
Jiayue.

651
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,100
See, it's so short and small.

652
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:28,940
Just like lilliputian.

653
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,780
Stand up.

654
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,930
Lilliputian, see.

655
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,940
- So flat.
- So flat.

656
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,100
Come, look at this.

657
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,280
Long legs.

658
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,260
Come, stretch your legs out.

659
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,460
One, two, three.

660
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,100
So small. Squat down.

661
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,500
Granny loved to laugh.

662
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,060
She laughed when she was happy

663
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,020
or said hello,

664
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,020
and she always laughed heartily.

665
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,680
Whenever we were far away,

666
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:28,160
we could hear her laughing.

667
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,060
Jiayue,

668
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,620
no matter if Granny

669
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,620
remembered you or us

670
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,980
in the end,

671
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,820
we will think of her whenever we laugh

672
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,500
in the future.

673
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,500
She will still be with us.

674
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,980
One, two.

675
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,420
Look at the moon today.

676
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,340
Isn't it bright?

677
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,580
Granny used to love

678
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,140
to look at the moon there.

679
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,100
Baby, do you know?

680
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,260
She used

681
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,300
to tell me

682
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,780
that there was Chang'e

683
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,540
on the moon.

684
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:42,820
So

685
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:45,640
she named me Xiu'e.

686
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,940
Xiu'e.

687
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,300
Later, beliefs improved.

688
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:56,360
She stopped telling
superstitious stories.

689
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,780
She gave you your name, too.

690
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,420
Jiayue.

691
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,180
Jiayue.

692
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,740
It still has to do with the moon.

693
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,140
So I've often wondered

694
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,740
if she had some story

695
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,780
in her life

696
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,060
that we don't know about,

697
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,260
something to do with the moon.

698
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,460
Maybe

699
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,220
she secretly

700
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,740
had a relationship

701
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,430
under the moon.

702
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,300
Baby,

703
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,580
I went to the bank again today.

704
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,260
I tried the card

705
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,300
Granny gave you

706
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,100
once more.

707
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,420
5.

708
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,700
56.

709
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,740
560.

710
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,740
5603.

711
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,780
56032.

712
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,460
560328.

713
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:30,300
(Please select: Change PIN, Transfer,
Inquiry, Withdraw, Deposit, Remove Card)

714
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,340
When I was

715
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,420
very young,

716
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,420
she always called me

717
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,060
"my sweetie".

718
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,180
"My sweetie".

719
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,600
I don't know

720
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,820
when she started
calling me "scatterbrain".

721
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,740
So,

722
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:04,530
her last words to me

723
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,380
were all meant for her sweetie.

724
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,460
You two

725
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,020
have been fighting your whole lives,

726
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:18,940
but the last thing

727
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,140
she remembers is all about you.

728
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,660
I don't even know

729
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,820
what and when

730
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,260
her last words

731
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,740
to me were.

732
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,260
Baby,

733
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,260
let me show you something.

734
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,380
I found this

735
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,860
while organizing Granny's stuff

736
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,140
today.

737
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:57,980
Look!

738
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,380
This is

739
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,660
a picture of Granny holding you

740
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,380
when you first arrived in Shanghai.

741
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,020
There's a sentence on the back.

742
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:16,980
I don't know

743
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,380
(Baby, you're perfect as you are now.)
why she wrote it.

744
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,020
Granny,

745
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,700
if I grow into a big tree
and become better,

746
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,380
will you be happier?

747
00:39:54,660 --> 00:40:01,660
(Baby, you're perfect as you are now.)

748
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:02,780
Baby,

749
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,580
you're perfect

750
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,860
as you are now.

751
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:09,540
(Baby, you're perfect as you are now.)

752
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,540
(Baby, you're perfect as you are now.)

753
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,620
(Sailor)

754
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,100
Reed,

755
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,300
it's been a while.

756
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:00,660
How have you been?

757
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,500
I'm always here

758
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:03,860
if you want to chat.

759
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,380
Reed,

760
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:08,940
I'll share a quote with you.

761
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,340
Life is always full of scars,

762
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,740
