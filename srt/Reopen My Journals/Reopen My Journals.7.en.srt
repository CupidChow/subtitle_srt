00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,280
Brother Xiao Han.

25
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,430
Jiayue.

26
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,280
I lost my temper today.

27
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,400
It was my fault.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,070
Are you angry?

29
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,520
No.

30
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,760
Brother Xiao Han,

31
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,710
if I did something wrong

32
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,640
or said something wrong,

33
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,070
you should just tell me.

34
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,030
Please don't yell at me.

35
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,400
It's not like that.

36
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,400
It was not because of you.

37
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,680
Well, something

38
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,710
happened to me,

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,470
and I lost control.

40
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,080
It was my fault.

41
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,750
I apologize.

42
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,080
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,080
Brother Xiao Han.

44
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:28,960
What happened to you?

45
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,890
Is there anything I can help with?

46
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,470
No need.

47
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,080
I...

48
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,710
I can handle it myself.

49
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,800
Don't worry.

50
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,030
Then I'm leaving.

51
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,080
Rest early.

52
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,710
I just saw him.

53
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,870
Even though I didn't yell at him,

54
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,030
(Message, to Sailor)
I expressed my feelings.

55
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,030
I feel much better.

56
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,770
He also apologized to me.

57
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:05,870
Thank you.

58
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,100
(Message, Sending)

59
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,200
Mao Tou.

60
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,560
You're back.

61
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,200
Where's Han?

62
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,800
Inside.

63
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,190
I've got all these bags.

64
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,520
Can't you give me a hand?

65
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,630
You're so dull.

66
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,800
Little imp.

67
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,400
I'll take it to Han.

68
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,080
You made such a mess.

69
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,920
You'll be in trouble.

70
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,310
Han.

71
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:49,870
Look,

72
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,910
Mao Tou's dad got you
a new pair of sneakers.

73
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:53,990
I don't want it.

74
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,520
Don't be shy.

75
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,430
I bought sneakers for both of you.

76
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,470
You can wear them in the competition.

77
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:01,880
Father and son, together.

78
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,240
Matching shoes for brothers.

79
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,870
I'm not going to the competition.

80
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,310
You guys can do it.

81
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,320
Han,

82
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,270
what's wrong?

83
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:28,710
Nothing.

84
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,320
Well...

85
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:36,710
You guys talk.

86
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,470
Little imp.

87
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,720
What's going on here?

88
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,310
We heard what you said

89
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,270
at home today.

90
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,000
Brother Xiao Han

91
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,680
doesn't want you to be together.

92
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,360
Were you there

93
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,480
when we were talking?

94
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,640
Aiping...

95
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,510
I'm heading out.

96
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,800
Call me if you need anything.

97
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,790
Little imp!

98
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,520
What's wrong?

99
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,920
You can talk to me about anything.

100
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,880
Okay.

101
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,270
I'll leave you alone.

102
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,320
Mom.

103
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,240
Trust me.

104
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,870
I'll make you live a good life.

105
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,390
We don't need anyone's help.

106
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,360
I got it.

107
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,780
(Yingmo Community)

108
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,230
I'm giving it back.

109
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,400
Aiping, I think...

110
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,510
I know Han well.

111
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,160
He's just like his dad,

112
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,070
stubborn in nature

113
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,310
and extremely proud.

114
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,750
I think it's not about

115
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,560
self-esteem.

116
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,810
Youguang has been gone for years.

117
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,290
You can't stay alone forever.

118
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,310
Han has grown up, right?

119
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,830
If you explain things to him,

120
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,870
he'll be reasonable

121
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,750
and understand.

122
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,600
All these years,

123
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,120
I've tried so hard to make you

124
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,960
accept...

125
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,400
Of course,

126
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,360
you haven't agreed yet,

127
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,390
but I feel like in your heart,

128
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,480
I'm someone you could consider,

129
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,840
is that right?

130
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,540
I know

131
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,720
you've always been good to me,

132
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,560
and to Han,

133
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,160
but sometimes

134
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,670
I really don't know

135
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,360
how to tell Han about this.

136
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,680
I also don't know

137
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,190
how to explain it
to Youguang in the photo.

138
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,120
There's a barrier in my heart.

139
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,560
I just can't get over it.

140
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,320
It's really hard...

141
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:41,750
However,

142
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,920
it's okay.

143
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,630
I will make Han

144
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,440
accept me

145
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,000
and understand us,

146
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,040
right?

147
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,960
Give me some time

148
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,670
and give us some time,

149
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,320
okay?

150
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,960
Aiping.

151
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,560
Fangfang, you're here.

152
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,360
Why didn't you go to

153
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,720
the Model Family competition?

154
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,360
My husband

155
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,910
insisted Chen Mo play guzheng

156
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,750
and must play it well.

157
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,000
Two hours of practice every day.

158
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,720
Now Chen Mo quit.

159
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,750
Why didn't you go either?

160
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,360
Fangfang, you're here.

161
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,470
Pei.

162
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,010
You didn't go to the competition?

163
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,480
What's the point?

164
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,550
As Director Zhao said,

165
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,600
each family

166
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,790
could only perform one show.

167
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,390
We couldn't submit two shows.

168
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,670
So, should I go,

169
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,910
or should Liu Songming go?

170
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,910
Then I thought, "Forget it,

171
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:04,750
never mind."

172
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,390
Then only

173
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,840

00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:05,750
Xiu'e,

195
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,720
you're here!

196
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,320
- For the prize.
- Hurry!

197
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,720
I've prepared it for you.

198
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,440
Singapore-Malaysia-Thailand!

199
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,840
Your travel voucher.

200
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,000
Thanks, Director!

201
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,350
Director Zhao.

202
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,360
Singapore, Malaysia,
and Thailand, right?

203
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,480
How can I finish it in one day?

204
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,320
Right.

205
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,030
A one-day trip isn't enough.

206
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,120
(Xin-Ma-Tai One-Day Tour)

207
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,630
What's the spelling?

208
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,790
(The Spots Include:)
Xin Village, Ma Bridge, Tairi Old Street,

209
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:36,700
one-day tour.

210
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,790
What's wrong with Zhang Qiming?

211
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,600
I'm so pissed off!

212
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,910
I fell for Zhang Qiming's trick.

213
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,110
He offered

214
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,440
a Xin-Ma-Tai Travel Prize.

215
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,840
How dare he play word games?

216
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,120
Director Zhao also got angry

217
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,670
and scolded him on the phone.

218
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,550
Good! I'd scold him too.

219
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,390
Right?

220
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,320
Aiping.

221
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,790
Why did Zhang Qiming do this?

222
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,910
Is he into you or something?

223
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,600
I've been thinking about it.

224
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,320
Zhang Qiming showed off

225
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,870
and sponsored the competition.

226
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,710
For what?

227
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,870
What could he get?

228
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,510
Could it be that he wanted
to team up with Aiping

229
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,120
and chase her?

230
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,870
No way.

231
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,720
They're always under my watch.

232
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,320
If Zhang Qiming had feelings for her,

233
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,200
how could I not notice?

234
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,390
Besides, look at his appearance, right?

235
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:34,080
He can't even compare to Ge You, right?

236
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,350
Aiping.

237
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,790
If Zhang Qiming really

238
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,750
likes you and wants to pursue you,

239
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,320
then quitting was a wise choice.

240
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,670
I support you!

241
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,920
Pei...

242
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,510
Director Dong.

243
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,090
Long time no see.

244
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:48,940
- Yes.
- You're here.

245
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,870
Are you here for food?

246
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,360
How rare!

247
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,160
Liu Songming!

248
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,030
Come out and see who's here.

249
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,000
Who's here?

250
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,080
Dong!

251
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:00,630
It's been so long,

252
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,720
and you haven't changed.

253
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:02,670
- Oh?
- Same as usual,

254
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,960
I'll make you some spicy noodles.

255
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,120
Please don't.

256
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,110
Well,

257
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,960
no rush.

258
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,960
I came here today

259
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,390
for a specific reason.

260
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,720
It's something important.

261
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,000
I have big news for you.

262
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,630
The land of No. 9 Factory was sold,

263
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,440
but a small part was kept.

264
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,510
With the support

265
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,000
of the district government

266
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,750
and the local entrepreneurs,

267
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,030
we established a museum

268
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,480
of No. 9 Factory.

269
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,510
- Museum?
- Come on.

270
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,350
Take a look. Come on.

271
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,200
We preserved

272
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,960
and organized the items

273
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,270
with commemorative value

274
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,980
(Opening of Memory Museum)
of No. 9 Factory.

275
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,860
The museum will open

276
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,120
(Puyang No. 9 Cotton Textile Factory)
in two weeks.

277
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,480
This is the invitation.

278
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,080
This is the brochure

279
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,200
we made.

280
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,040
Here.

281
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,830
- Pei.
- Thank you.

282
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,920
Gui.

283
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,080
Liu Songming,
my name is Liu Songming now.

284
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,110
Songming, okay.

285
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,750
Xiu'e.

286
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,000
I'll send this
to Chairwoman Liao myself.

287
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,670
Remember, bring your family.

288
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,600
Director Dong, we were

289
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,870
laid off, right?

290
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,000
What's the point

291
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,150
of the formalism?

292
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:08,870
If you have enough money,

293
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,360
why don't you give the laid-off workers

294
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,960
some living allowance, right?

295
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,200
Exactly, we need

296
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,390
living allowance, Dong.

297
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,960
Women, you need some awareness.

298
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,600
Awareness isn't useful, Liu Dagui.

299
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:21,440
We need something tangible now.

300
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,150
We need money.

301
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,800
Xiu'e,

302
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,360
please stop embarrassing me,

303
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,200
okay?

304
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,160
Right?

305
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,510
Well... It's been hard

306
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,480
to set up

307
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,390
this museum.

308
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,090
You all know
the situation in our factory.

309
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,960
Listen,

310
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,960
this time,

311
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,550
Zhang Qiming, Mr. Zhang,

312
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,120
negotiated with many people

313
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,790
to solve this issue.

314
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,840
Dong,

315
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,390
you used to call Zhang Qiming...

316
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,080
Hustler Zhang, right?

317
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,910
Now you call him Mr. Zhang?

318
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,000
He's made a fortune,

319
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,790
and you're treating him
differently, right?

320
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,120
Things have changed, okay?

321
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,960
What did you call me back then?

322
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,320
Director Dong.

323
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,870
Now you call me Dong.

324
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,150
We're in different times.

325
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,630
Aiping, this is yours.

326
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,670
The finish line is in front!

327
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,510
Sprint!

328
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,120
Come on!

329
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,150
Go, go, go! That's great!

330
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,120
Well done, Chen Mo!

331
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,600
Keep it up, Tingting!

332
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,870
Excellent, first and second! Well done!

333
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:19,870
You got perfect scores.

334
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,120
The rest of you! Keep it up!

335
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,200
Who's the third one?

336
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,870
Very good. Keep going!

337
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:26,750
Sprint!

338
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,590
Go, go, go!

339
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:29,870
Sprint! Sprint!

340
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,150
Faster!

341
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,720
Where are you going?

342
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:35,750
To find them.

343
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,040
Ka Men!

344
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,300
- Qian Jiayue!
- Move, move!

345
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,160
- Come on!
- Run!

346
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,800
Speed up!

347
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:43,670
I can't, Ka Men.

348
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,240
Swing your arms!

349
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,870
So close to the finish line!

350
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,480
Come on, yes!

351
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,240
Swing your arms!

352
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,200
- Come on!
- Go!

353
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,600
Speed up, speed up!

354
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,030
Great, 3 minutes and 58 seconds.
You passed.

355
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,120
Great.

356
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,630
You passed.

357
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,230
Thanks.

358
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,320
Chen Mo.

359
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:17,710
Nice!

360
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,230
I'm exhausted!

361
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,220
Have a seat.

362
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,560
Nice!

363
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,480
I didn't know Loner Xiao

364
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,030
was quite good at playing basketball.

365
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,630
Stop calling him Loner Xiao.

366
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:41,750
- Nice!
- Good!

367
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,800
Eyes on the ball!

368
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,230
Protect the ball.

369
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,600
Pass it to me.

370
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,120
Then catch it.

371
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,110
Nice, Chen Mo!

372
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,960
Chen Mo.

373
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,880
Why do you always oppose Brother Xiao Han?

374
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,920
Just joking around.

375
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,960
I'm going to the bathroom.

376
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,800
Look,

377
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,640
Liu Jianfeng's shoes are so cool.

378
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,000
Those are the new Nikes.

379
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,440
The grip of the shoes

380
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,440
is amazing.

381
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:23,720
How much do they cost?

382
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,000
We can't afford them anyway.

383
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,200
Liu Jianfeng

384
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,720
wears such nice shoes.

385
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,220
(Jiale Wontons)

386
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,450
- On my way...
- What to eat?

387
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,640
On my way here,

388
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,880
I got a phone call.

389
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,400
A business trip in Hangzhou.

390
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,510
You don't need to tell me that.

391
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,560
I have to.

392
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,790
From now on,

393
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,720
I'll report my schedules to you.

394
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,160
No need to report.

395
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,590
Have you told Mao Tou?

396
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,110
With you guys,

397
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,000
Mao Tou won't starve.

398
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,320
Aiping,

399
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,160
I thought about it until midnight.

400
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,790
I stayed up all night...

401
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,680
Zhang Qiming, you're here.

402
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,350
Should I call you Mr. Zhang?

403
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,480
Good on you.

404
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,510
Director Dong

405
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,070
just came by.

406
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:56,310
He said you did something great
for the factory, right?

407
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,110
You thought we didn't know?

408
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,000
Not a big deal.

409
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,440
Want some food? Wait.

410
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,110
Mr. Zhang,

411
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,750
what would you like to eat?

412
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,110
Stop acting like this.

413
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,040
You're so annoying.

414
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,430
Well.

415
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,350
What would you like?

416
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,400
I like them all.

417
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,750
Let me take a look.

418
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,920
You remember everything on the menu.

419
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,760
Do you need to check?

420
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,350
It's hard to choose.

421
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,480
Alright, go ahead.

422
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,920
Once you've decided, tell Aiping.

423
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,590
Alright, thank you.

424
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,000
I thought about it until midnight.

425
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,160
I stayed up all night.

426
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:39,110
I think there's a way

427
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,720
to solve our issue.

428
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,110
But I haven't figured out

429
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,510
how to solve it.

430
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,310
Well, as the saying goes,

431
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,440
challenges are like springs.

432
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,270
If you're strong, they'll yield.

433
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,680
If you're weak, they get stronger.

434
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,310
With great sceneries,

435
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,510
Hangzhou is a perfect place to think.

436
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,880
I'll think about it thoroughly

437
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,000
and come up with a solution.

438
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,110
Boss,

439
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,520
don't worry.

440
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,000
Stop doing this.

441
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,110
I...

442
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,110
Isn't your washing machine broken?

443
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:06,960
I bought a new one.

444
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,940
It will arrive in a few days.

445
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,160
It can be repaired.

446
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,550
Please don't. Don't want it.

447
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,680
I've already bought it.

448
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,200
It'll arrive soon, and I...

449
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,160
Mr. Zhang.

450
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,590
Have you decided?

451
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,480
I... I'll have...

452
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:20,910
have...

453
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,190
have...

454
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,080
have...

455
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,310
Pork chop noodles?

456
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,390
No, I'll have...

457
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,960
Wontons?

458
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,510
I can't order now.

459
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,510
I just got a call.

460
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,640
I'm going to Hangzhou.

461
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,480
Call me if anything comes up.

462
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,960
Then why were you pretending

463
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,000
to make orders?

464
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,880
Are you playing me?

465
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,750
So what if I did?

466
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,480
It'll collapse.

467
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,030
The wonderful

468
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,240
image of you in my heart

469
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,480
just collapsed!

470
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,200
You are so dramatic.

471
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,510
Zhang Qiming, you...

472
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,280
How ridiculous.

473
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,110
Why is the midterm exam
coming up so soon?

474
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,160
It feels like school just started.

475
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:06,590
Yes.

476
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,160
High school is just one exam

477
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,640
after another exam.

478
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:11,910
Qian Jiayue.

479
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,800
Mao Tou?

480
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,840
Why are you here?

481
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Emergency.

482
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,480
What emergency?

483
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,880
You have to save me.

484
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,390
Report.

485
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,110
Jiayue.

486
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,550
Why is it you again?

487
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,160
This time,

488
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,510
Zhang Yang made

489
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,920
a serious mistake

490
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,440
and unforgivable mistake.

491
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,390
Do you understand?

492
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,510
You're only his neighbor.

493
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,510
You're not responsible.

494
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,440
What did he do this time?

495
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,280
Cheating.

496
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,510
Group cheating!

497
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,350
I caught them in the act.

498
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,350
It was his idea.

499
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,510
I asked others to call their parents.

500
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,960
They came immediately,

501
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,160
but he played tricks again

502
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,400
and called you over.

503
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,550
Listen,

504
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,590
you're definitely getting expelled.

505
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,590
You're expelled, okay?

506
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,430
Mr. Jiang!

507
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:05,240
Please give him another chance.

508
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,790
I'll vouch for him.

509
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,720
His dad is really busy.

510
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,400
He's often on business trips.

511
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,200
I assure you,

512
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,550
as soon as he's back,

513
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,990
I'll take him to school

514
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,160
right away.

515
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:22,530
Goodbye.

516
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,510
Why are you saying goodbye?

517
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:27,170
I'm going home.

518
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:28,680
For what?

519
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,840
Your dad isn't there.

520
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,110
What are you going to eat?

521
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,790
Don't tell them about this.

522
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,440
Mao Tou.

523
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,350
You're already in Grade 9.

524
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:45,880
Can't you focus on your studies?

525
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,160
Look at you.

526
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,160
School just started,

527
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,320
and you're already in trouble.

528
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,000
Listen,

529
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,270
Zombie is targeting me on purpose.

530
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,680
He's Mr. Jiang.

531
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,480
Don't give teachers nicknames.

532
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,520
Anybody home?

533
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,880
- Who?
- Anybody...?

534
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,550
Is Guan Aiping home?

535
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,280
Hello.

536
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,150
Hello.

537
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,550
Is this Guan Aiping's home?

538
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,800
Yes.

539
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,920
What do you need?

540
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,590
We're delivering a washing machine.

541
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,880
Come on, bring it in.

542
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,860
Come on.

543
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,590
Wait a minute.

544
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:23,920
Who bought this?

545
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,480
There's an order.

546
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,130
Mr. Zhang

547
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,940
asked us to deliver it here.

548
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,580
(Zhang Qiming)
Room 207, right?

549
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,420
Yes.

550
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,150
Right here.

551
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,310
This isn't ours. Please take it back.

552
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,510
Wait a moment, young man.

553
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,070
How's that possible?

554
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,790
The order says Room 207, right?

555
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,720
This is your place.

556
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,030
I said it's not ours.

557
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,110
Take it back. Return it.

558
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,480
- Wait!
- Hey, buddy.

559
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,680
- You can't.
- Can't return it.

560
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,590
Mr. Zhang

561
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,620
opened the package in our store.

562
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,500
It's brand new.

563
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,680
- Why can't I return it?
- No...

564
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,110
Young man, don't rush.

565
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,160
We're just delivery guys.

566
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,510
We deliver the washing machine

567
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,590
and test the water connections,

568
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:58,830
and our job is done.

569
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,880
If you don't want it,

570
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,070
throw it away

571
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,160
or give it

572
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,510
to a garbageman.

573
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,070
It's none of our business, okay?

574
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,920
We're just trying to make a living.

575
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,880
Young man, please help us.

576
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,310
Don't make it hard for us, alright?

577
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,310
Okay? Please help us.

578
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,350
Yes.

579
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,310
Okay, where should I put it?

580
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,270
- Bathroom.
- Okay, bathroom.

581
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,750
Put it properly.

582
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,070
- Okay?
- Okay.

583
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,000
Do you know this place?

584
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,510
It's No. 9 Factory's employee canteen.

585
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,920
It's quite big inside.

586
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,140
We can even watch movies there.

587
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,350
Mao Tou.

588
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,720
Come over.

589
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,510
Your parents

590
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:43,000
had their first date here.

591
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,070
Later on,

592
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:48,110
(Employee Canteen)
they often brought you here to have meals

593
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,480
and watch movies.

594
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,310
It was really interesting.

595
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,440
Granny, is this you?

596
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,350
Yes, it is.

597
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,750
Comrade Liao Dongmei,

598
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,240
March 8th Red Flag Bearer.

599
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,960
Granny, you used to be

600
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,160
a March 8th Red Flag Bearer?

601
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,000
Flag bearer of Shanghai City.

602
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,510
That was a big title.

603
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:11,030
(Puyang No. 9 Cotton Textile Factory)
Look, many model workers' names

604
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,400
(List of Model Workers)
are here.

605
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,560
Isn't it great?

606
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,160
Model workers?

607
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,160
Now they're all laid-off workers.

608
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,110
Don't put it like that,

609
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:20,950
okay?

610
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,030
Time only moves forward indeed,

611
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,550
but we should respect history
all the same.

612
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,070
We should especially respect

613
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:34,110
the honorable traditions and history

614
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,680
of hard-working workers.

615
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,560
Shouldn't we?

616
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,040
- Yes.
- Yes.

617
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,880
But now,

618
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,030
look at all these

619
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,000
articles and TV series.

620
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,790
Whenever it comes to Shanghai,

621
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,920
it's always about old Shanghai,

622
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,310
the decadent music,

623
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,200
and the Paramount.

624
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,110
No, that's not right.

625
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:54,950
Absolutely not.

626
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,350
Do you know

627
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,550
what Shanghai is?

628
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,000
It's where I grew up.

629
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:11,310
It's also the birthplace
of the modern labor movement.

630
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,070
This time, Dong and others

631
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,510
not only established a museum,

632
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,350
but also made a brochure.

633
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,680
That's how we respect history.

634
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,270
Everyone who worked

635
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,110
at No. 9 Factory

636
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,070
can savor the old days.

637
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,110
Good on them.

638
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:29,000
Please move forward.

639
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,270
The factory is closed,

640
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:33,070
and we've got the compensation.

641
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,790
What's the point of establishing

642
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,110
a museum?

643
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,310
Anyway, I won't go to
the opening ceremony.

644
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,960
For people like you,

645
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:43,110
I know you won't be there.

646
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,720
But I'll definitely attend it.

647
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,000
Go if you will,

648
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,160
but don't drag Aiping along.

649
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:52,510
I'm worried she'll feel upset

650
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,070
when she visits the old place.

651
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,310
Sometimes, I think

652
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,110
Xiao Youguang was quite silly.

653
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:03,160
He sacrificed his life heroically,

654
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,000
but left a widow and a child behind.

655
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,160
All his efforts in vain.

656
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:10,240
Don't talk nonsense
in front of the kids.

657
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,400
How's that nonsense?

658
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,310
I'm just telling the truth, right?

659
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,110
Look at Aiping.

660
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,790
She has two jobs.

661
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,070
She works from 5 a.m.

662
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,000
to 9 p.m. at night.

663
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,720
As for Xiao Han,

664
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,070
he grew up without a father.

665
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:24,450
Poor child.

666
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,070
His clothes

667
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,070
and backpacks

668
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,750
are all hand-me-downs.

669
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,070
Poor boy.

670
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,640
Now, look at Mao Tou.

671
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,720
Mao Tou, your dad was a nobody

672
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,510
at No. 9 Factory.

673
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:43,000
But now he's quite something.

674
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,400
Style his hair,

675
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,750
hold a cell phone,

676
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,550
ride in a car. He's a boss now.

677
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,790
As for Xiao Youguang,

678
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,790
who still remembers him?

679
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,070
No one.

680
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,000
Whether he's remembered or not,

681
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,400
Xiao Youguang is always a hero.

682
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,880
Nowadays, if you can make money,
you'll be a hero.

683
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:05,910
Mom!

684
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,200
Please stop!

685
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,510
I don't want to hear it!

686
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,070
I'm back.

687
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,510
Mom, you're back.

688
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,800
Mom.

689
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,960
He sent it to us.

690

Han.

691
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,270
Mom didn't accept it.

692
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,480
I know.

693
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,390
Mom.

694
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,350
Don't use it now.

695
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,200
I'll find a way to return it.

696
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,550
Then I'll buy you a new one

697
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,590
with my own money.

698
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,920
How will you get the money?

703

I can give you a good life.

704

I go to Hangzhou.

I go to Shanghai.

When you call, I'll come. When I come,

711
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:04,790
I'll drink.

712
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,680
Feeling better?

713
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,920
I'm fine.

Listen, I'm really struggling.

717
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,560
Because...

718
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,510

She's not worthy to be your mom.

724
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,920
She looked down on me.

725
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:06,110
She went to Japan and left us behind.

726
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,160
She looked down on me.

727
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,960
She's not worthy to be your mom.

728
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,920
Are you finished?

729
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,750
Yes.

I am a role model.

736
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,350
Okay.

737
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,070
Not in the bedroom.

738
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,590
It's hard to clean.

739

I won't mess up.

Never mess up.

- It's really

763
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,400
an ordinary pair of sneakers.

764
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,070
Can't compare to your Air Jordans.

765
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:34,940
- It's really...
- New shoes, Wang Bin.

766
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,280
You noticed?

767
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:37,880
According to the rule,

768
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,510
we should step on them.

769
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,830
Don't! You'll ruin them!

770
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,320
Chang Wuji!

771
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,760
You go first.

772
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,590
Why did she take the initiative?

773
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,720
The school magazine is soliciting
articles about good students.

774
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,160
Qian Jiayue decided
to write an exclusive interview for this.

775
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,720
She's creating trouble for herself.

776
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,350
Why do I like science subjects?

777
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:07,350
Why are you asking me this?

778
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:09,920
(Integrity, Diligence,
Responsibility, Virtue)

779
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,400
It's Zhao Tingting again.

780
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,840
(Zhao Tingting, Xiao Han)
She's next to Xiao Han.

781
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,180
(Striving)

782
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,480
Here's the thing.

783
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,040
I want to write an article
about an interesting classmate

784
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,000
for the school magazine.

785
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,160
Me?

786
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,550
You think I'm interesting?

787
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,360
Actually, I just want to ask

788
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,320
if you find math

789
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,110
and physics interesting?

790
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,150
I do find them quite interesting.

791
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,840
Well, for example,

792
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,280
what's interesting about them?

793
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,510
Fibonacci sequence.

794
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,150
It's a sequence

795
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,710
of natural numbers,

796
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,630
yet its formula

797
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,150
involves irrational numbers.

798
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,440
Moreover, as it approaches infinity,

799
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,630
the ratio of consecutive terms

800
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,320
gets closer to 0.618.

801
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,400
It's the golden ratio.

802
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,240
Cool.

803
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:08,870
By the way,

804
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,110
how did the genius interview go?

805
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:13,190
I didn't understand a thing.

806
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,400
No wonder he's a genius.

807
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,230
But why did you suddenly
want to write for the magazine?

808
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,280
Well...

809
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,550
Since

810
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,670
the class placement exam,

811
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,680
she's been down

812
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:26,550
because she couldn't make it
to the key class.

813
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,190
I guess she wants to prove herself
in another way.

814
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:32,400
Prove herself?

815
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,840
She just wants
to create more opportunities

816
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,840
to get closer to someone.

817
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,160
Nonsense.

818
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,670
Ka Men, can I borrow your notes?

819
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,800
Get it yourself.

820
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,270
Pass it, please.

821
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,600
Okay.

822
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,840
Gone, it's all gone!

823
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,400
What's gone?

824
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,960
The lunch money is gone!

825
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:51,890
Lunch money?

826
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,230
Take everything out.

827
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,440
I remember I put it in the drawer.

828
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,150
Yes, we all saw that.

829
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,550
Yes. How could it be missing?

830
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,920
Who took the lunch money?

831
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,010
Give it back!

832
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,350
Qian Jiayue.

833
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,150
Is the money missing?

834
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,680
I'm sorry...

835
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,710
How could you be so careless?

836
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,190
It's not her fault.

837
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,760
I saw her put it in the drawer

838
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,400
before the P.E. class,

839
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,550
and she tied a knot on the bag.

840
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,670
I saw it too.

841
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,880
Who took the lunch money?

842
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,710
It was lost during the P.E. class.

843
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,320
Maybe it wasn't our classmate.

844
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,030
Only our classmates knew

845
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,390
we collected lunch money today.

846
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,600
Yes, that's right.

847
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,630
Others didn't know

848
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,670
Qian Jiayue had the money.

849
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,280
Well,

850
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,550
who went back during the P.E. class?

851
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:39,990
Yes.

852
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:40,960
Who came back?

853
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:42,230
No one came back.

854
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,200
Time to go.

855
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:02,390
Wait.

856
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,360
Why's everyone looking at me?

857
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,550
I did come back,

858
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:07,760
I needed to grab something.

859
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,510
What did you grab?

860
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:11,760
What do you mean, Chen Mo?

861
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:13,960
You think I took it, huh?

862
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,630
My new basketball shoes

863
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:17,920
were stepped on.

864
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:19,920
I felt bad,

865
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,960
so I changed them.

866
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,800
What's wrong?

867
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,160
Is there a problem?

868
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,760
You came back too.

869
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,320
She also came back.

870
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,750
I went to the bathroom.

871
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,590
Besides,
how could I take Jiayue's money?

872
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,920
I came back to change my shoes.

873
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,590
How could I take Jiayue's money?

874
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,840
But I wasn't even in the classroom.

875
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,550
I saw you entering the classroom.

876
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,710
I clearly saw him sneaking out

877
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,150
of the classroom alone.

878
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,070
You're also a suspect...

879
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,030
I wouldn't slander him.

880
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:40,920
I know, I know.

881
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,800
Didn't you hear the bell?

882
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,640
Chen Mo,

883
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,840
it's you again.

884
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,030
Our lunch money is missing.

885
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:51,870
We're looking for it.

886
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,030
How could it go missing?

887
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,320
Who's in life committee?

888
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,110
I am, teacher.

889
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,320
Qian Jiayue, what's happened?

890
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,760
I collected the lunch money
this morning.

891
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,000
1128 yuan in total.

892
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:11,150
Then I wrapped the money in this bag

893
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,960
and put it in my drawer.

894
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,070
When we came back

895
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,600
from the P.E. class,

896
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:16,970
it was gone.

897
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:18,440
Who took it?

898
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,840
Bring it back.

899
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:26,960
Weren't you

900
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,190
just having a heated discussion?

901
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,360
Didn't you just find the culprit?

902
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,200
Chen Mo.

903
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:33,730
What happened?

904
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,840
We were only discussing,

905
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,440
but we shouldn't accuse others
without proof.

906
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,320
Qian Jiayue,

907
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,190
who were you talking about?

908
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,030
No idea.

909
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,880
Liu Wanqing,

910
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,190
who did you suspect?

911
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,150
I don't know.

912
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,000
Chang Wuji.

913
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,000
I don't know, teacher.

914
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,390
Very well.

915
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,800
No one's willing to say.

916
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:07,150
You think it's good for that person?

917
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,550
What you are doing

918
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,030
is called harboring!

919
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,800
Pei Dongni.

920
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,280
Call Mr. Zhou over here.

921
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,030
Hurry up.

922
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,920
Tell him what happened.

923
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,500
(Shanghai Puyang No. 2 Middle School)

924
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,030
Does anyone want

925
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:34,960
to stand up

926
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,110
and tell me it was a mistake?

927
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,550
Still no one, right?

928
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,120
Alright then.

929
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,390
Class committee.

930
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,640
Stand up.

931
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,760
Search backpacks.

932
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,360
I don't believe the money
can go anywhere else.

933
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:57,760
Everyone, show us your backpack.

934
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,920
This is too much.

935
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,320
It's our privacy.

936
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,920
Zhu Wei, go through this row.

937
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:07,150
Liu Wanqing, that row.

938
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,030
Ms. Wu, Ms. Wu.

939
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,920
Please calm down.

940
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:12,550
Well,

941
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:14,190
I'll swap my afternoon class

942
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,710
with this one.

943
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,840
Come this afternoon.

944
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,070
I'm going to

945
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:19,950
hold a class meeting now.

946
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,940
I'll guide them properly.

947
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,110
You're the director.

948
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,710
Save your authority for later,

949
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,840
okay?

950
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:28,320
If I can't handle it, you'll step in.

951
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,250
That's the right order,

952
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,390
right?

953
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:39,150
Mr. Zhou, this is your class.

954
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:40,710
They're your students.

955
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,150
They are completely

956
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,110
out of control.

957
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:47,950
Okay.

958
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:48,870
You handle it first.

959
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:52,230
I'll wait for the result.

960
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,030
Close that door.

961
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:23,400
What is he going to do?

962
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,780
(Kinship Concealment)

963
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,880
Does anyone know

964
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:28,920
what this sentence means?

965
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,900
Chinese Class Representative,

966
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,840
do you know?

967
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,630
Kinship Concealment.

968
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,960
I don't know, Mr. Zhou.

969
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,680
Sit down.

970
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,760
All of you.

971
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,590
It's from The Analects.

972
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,690
It means,

973
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,190
among close family members,

974
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,590
if a minor mistake is made,

975
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,740
it's acceptable to hide it or cover it up

976
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,800
to some extent.

977
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:01,710
Mr. Zhou means...

978
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:02,550
However,

979
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:04,280
if it's not

980
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,550
stealing 1000 yuan

981
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,920
but home invasion,

982
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,400
bank robbing, arson,

983
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:10,760
or something like that,

984
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,030
will you tell the truth

985
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:13,760
when the police ask you?

986
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,190
They're serious crimes.

987
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:19,030
We should tell them, right?

988
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:26,740
(Justice-supreme)

989
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,600
You must be familiar

990
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,110
with a saying

991
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,230
in The Zuo Tradition.

992
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:31,540
Place righteousness before family.

993
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,610
So,

994
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:35,190
when someone makes a mistake,

995
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:37,510
what should we do?

996
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,780
(Bond, Reason, Law)

997
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,640
Actually,

998
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,750
laws and regulations lie in

999
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,880
the bonds between humans,

1000
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,760
while human bonds

1001
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,670
mustn't exceed

1002
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,210
the moral boundaries
of reason and law.

1003
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,480
We need to learn the law,

1004
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:56,360
understand the law,
and view it dialectically.

1005
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,760
If this student

1006
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,510
really took the money,

1007
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,960
what should we do?

1008
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:05,070
Since we didn't expose the person,

1009
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:07,190
that person
should admit it themselves.

1010
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,760
Qian Jiayue,

1011
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,320
you're involved in this.

1012
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:16,880
