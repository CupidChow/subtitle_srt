- Canceled?
- Canceled?

25
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,010
It's not canceled.

26
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,400
We'll book two tables
at the Oriental Pearl Tower

27
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:49,690
with only

28
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,210
some close friends and family.

29
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,240
I was careless.

30
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,520
I calculated it again.

31
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,880
If we book the entire restaurant,

32
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,680
the cost will be terrifying.

33
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,040
Since the Southeast Asian

34
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,240
Financial Crisis,

35
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,090
foreign trade has been difficult.

36
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,400
Mr. Zhang,

37
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,680
you can't afford it,

38
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,240
but you were so high-profile.

39
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,050
We've sent the invitations,

40
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,520
and now you want to back out.

41
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:18,790
It's embarrassing.

42
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,140
You can't change it.

43
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,860
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,660
It's okay.

45
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,740
Little imp.

46
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,140
Why don't we

47
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,420
hold it at home?

48
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,700
Actually, I think

49
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,020
it'll be fun to hold it

50
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,300
at home.

51
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,380
Yes.

52
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,620
We're doing this

53
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,460
to make Chairwoman Liao happy.

54
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,300
We can host

55
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,540
a small ceremony

56
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,860
with our close friends and family.

57
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,620
That's good, right?

58
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,140
After all, it's our lives.

59
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,380
We don't need grand displays.

60
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,820
Don't book tables
at the Oriental Pearl Tower.

61
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,020
We'll eat at home.

62
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,420
That's true.

63
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,140
If we book two tables

64
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,980
without inviting our old colleagues,

65
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,980
they'll gossip about it forever.

66
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:18,980
Let's hold it at home.

67
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,620
We must invite Auntie

68
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,140
and Pei's family.

69
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,740
You can think about it.

70
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,620
As for other friends and relatives,

71
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,460
just send them some sweets.

72
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,420
Your opinion

73
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,540
doesn't matter.

74
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,260
Okay.

75
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,110
I'll cook.

79

(Sailor)
How have you been?

81
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,600
Do you have time to meet?

82
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,520
This is the fourth time.

83
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,960
I'm really sorry.

84
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,160
(Reed)
I've been really busy at home.

85
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,480
How busy can it be?

86
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,040
I know you well, Qian Jiayue.

87
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,160
Really busy?

88
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,200
It's alright.

89
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,400
Family is more important.

90
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,480
Let's meet when you have time.

91
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,480
Absolutely.

92
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,960
We see each other every day.

93
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,520
Is it not just about your family?

94
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,520
(Reed)

95
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,280
You always see through things.

96
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,480
Of course.

97
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,330
Recently, there have been some changes.

98
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,060
I'm thinking

99
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:09,940
(Send Message)

100
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,860
maybe I should
put an end to those stories.

101
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,060
It's finally over.

102
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,740
Come on, cheers.

103
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,980
What kind of ending?

104
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,740
I don't know.

105
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:32,980
A sentence

106
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,700
or a photo.

107
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,860
- Anyway,
- A sentence?

108
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,140
I need a ceremony.

109
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,060
A photo?

110
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,460
What photo?

(Yingmo Community)

112
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,940
Why are you here?

113
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,980
What do you mean?

114
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,180
This is my home.

115
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,740
I have nowhere to put the things I left

116
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,700
in Xiao Han's room,

117
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,540
so I moved them here.

118
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,620
Since you left,

119
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,060
it has become your storage.

120
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,740
If you put it that way,

121
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,060
I'll bring my computer tomorrow

122
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:15,900
and ask you to tutor me.

123
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,940
Who wants to tutor you?

124
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,460
What are you doing?

125
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,860
Do you remember

126
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,500
on one of your birthdays,

127
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,620
Uncle took the three of us out

128
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,820
and took a lot of photos?

129
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,380
I remember I put them here.

130
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,940
Brother Xiao Han, look!

131
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,260
- Is it there?
- Come on.

132
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,100
(Qingfeng Bridge)
The view is unique.

133
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:42,940
I'll take a photo.

134
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,580
Three, two, one.

135
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,180
I'll check your drawer.

136
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,820
Why are there so many toys?

137
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,740
Is it this one?

138
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,420
Let me see.

139
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,940
I think it is.

140
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,460
What's this for?

141
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,220
I remember

142
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,420
I have a photo with Brother Xiao Han.

143
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:14,950
Is it this one?

144
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,100
Why are you in this photo?

145
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,060
Never mind.

146
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:27,940
I'm leaving.

147
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,300
You're leaving?

148
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,780
I'll go home to eat.

149
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,300
I'm thinking

150
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,580
maybe I should
put an end to those stories.

151
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,900
A sentence

152
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,700
or a photo.

It's wrong.

(Card to be locked after 3 attempts.)

160
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,780
It's going to swallow my card.

161

My mom

162
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,780
is really old and forgetful.

(June 24, Baby's Birthday)

166
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,900
I'm doing well.

167
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,340
I'm so happy today.

168
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,180
Jianguo is getting married.

169
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,700
The car is waiting downstairs.

170
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,940
Let's go to the wedding together.

171
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,140
Okay?

Comrade,

173
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,220
can you call Chen Dehong

174
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,420
from No. 1 Branch Factory?

175
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,820
I'm so happy today.

176
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,660
Jianguo is getting married.

177
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,780
I know, I know.

178
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,300
You're busy and can't come back.

179
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,020
Granny.

180
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,500
The gold...

181
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,940
Did you buy the gold I told you about?

182
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,820
Didn't I give you my bank card?

183
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,460
Did you forget it again?

184
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,020
Mom!

185
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,340
She bought it.

186
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,540
It's big, right?

187
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,940
- It's big.
- Does it look good?

188
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,820
Yes, it looks good.

189
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,780
My sweetie bought it, right?

190
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,540
- For the wedding.
- You said the password was wrong.

191
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,580
Did you pay for it?

192
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,420
Do I have money?

193
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,420
Do I have secret savings?

194
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,940
Zhang Qiming bought it, but we'll tell her

195
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,940
we used her money

196
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,180
to make her happy.

197
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,060
Hurry up. Don't stand here.

198
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,060
Okay?

199
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,660
- A big one.
- Mom.

200
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,700
We don't have time.

201
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,820
I'll give it to Jianguo.

202
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:00,900
Alright.

203
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,500
Granny.

204
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,060
This.

205
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,580
Mom, you have good taste.

206
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,060
Pick another green one. It's good.

207
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,420
Did you forget the count?

208
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,820
How many items?

209
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,680
The first one, right?

210
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,310
The second one, right?

211
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,420
Then this is the third one.

212
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,180
Happy Birthday!

213
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,780
It's okay.

214
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,660
They're Baby's classmates.

215
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,670
What are you doing?

216
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:27,580
Qian Jiayue.

217
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,780
You didn't want to celebrate,

218
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,060
but we thought about it

219
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,300
and decided to have a small

220
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,700
birthday celebration for you.

221
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,300
Baby, we'll wait for you

222
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,140
at the convenience store.

223
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,260
Take your time.

224
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,780
Don't worry.

225
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,700
- Baby's classmates.
- Bye, Auntie.

226
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,700
Let's be quick.

227
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,060
Give her the gifts.

228
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,020
I'll go first.

229
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,780
Jiayue.

231
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,340
It's my favorite.

232
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,700
Jiayue.

233
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:56,900
This is

234
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,100
June's lucky stone.

235
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,180
I hope it can bring you luck.

236
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,190
Is this a moonstone?

237
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,260
Thank you!

238
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,300
You're welcome.

239
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,260
Jiayue.

240
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,460
You like using pens.

241
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,660
Here's my gift.

242
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,700
Here are ten tea eggs for you.

243
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,780
They aren't expensive,

244
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,180
but they were specially made

245
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,180
by Liu Jianfeng's mom.

246
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,020
Together, they symbolize
100 million yuan.

247
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:19,860
Here, Jiayue.

248
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,060
Ten zeros. That's 10 billion.

249
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,020
Never mind.

250
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,540
Alright.

251
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,300
Jiayue.

252
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,780
I drew this booklet by myself.

253
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,060

I know, back then...

260
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,700
No matter what,

261
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,780
I just want you to know

262
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,460

00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,800
- Me too.
- We'll all be there.

265
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,660

I'm really happy.

271
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,500
Okay.

272
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,660
The small celebration is over.

273
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,580
They're waiting for us.

274
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,420
We should leave.

275
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,300
Put the gifts back.

276
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,020
- I'll wait for you.
- Bye, Jiayue.

277
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,900
- Eat the eggs while they're hot.
- Hurry.

278
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,780
- They'll turn cold.
- And the lucky stone.

279
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,660
Come on.

280
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,340
Will she like it?

281
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,300
She will like it.

282
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,780
I'm sure.

283
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,180
Mom, let me check your hair.

284
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,300
It looks great.

285
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,780
We're here.

286
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,620
We are home.

287
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,460
Mom, look.

288
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,660
What is this character?

289
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,780
It's "Happiness".

290
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,900
It means wedding.

291
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,580
Who's getting married?

292
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,420
I'm getting married.

293
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,260
Mom!

294
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,220
It's your son Chen Jianguo.

295
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,700
- He's getting married.
- Welcome!

296
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,540

The flower boy
and the flower girl, right?

303
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,780
You're wrong.

304
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,620
Flower boy.

305
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,620
Flower girl.

306
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,300
So pretty.

307
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,700
- So pretty.
- I know, right?

308
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,500
- You're also here.
- Yes, of course.

309
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,900
Hurry, come in.

So beautiful!

311
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,780
It's amazing.

312
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,540
- You're also here.
- Yes.

313
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,660
Have a seat.

314
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,940
Everyone is ready.

315
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,060
Ladies and gentlemen.

316
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,580
Ladies and gentlemen.

317
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,060
On this joyous day,

318
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,460
first, let's

319
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,020
give a warm applause

320
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,460
to welcome the groom and the bride!

321
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,420
Okay!

322
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,780
Great!

323
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,660
The magpies chirp on branches.

324
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,220
The beautiful bride enters the carriage.

325
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,420
On this joyous day,

326
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,940
the groom

327
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,300
will say a few words

328
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,420
first.

329
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,180
I'll give a speech.

330
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,060
First of all,

331
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,300
dear friends and family,

332
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,940
thank you so much for coming.

333
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,620
Thank you.

334
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,900
I should thank you.

335
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,020
Since everyone is here,

336
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,620
please

337
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,900
witness this moment for me.

338
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,280
Okay.

339
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,820
What? What are they doing?

340
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,300
Your son is getting married.

341
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,700
Look, Mom!

342
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,460
I, Zhang Qiming...

343
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,940
Introduced...

344
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,340
Hongying?

345
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,900
It's Jianguo...

346
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,220
I, Jianguo!

347
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,580
I, Jianguo,

348
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,620
swear

349
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,180
in this lifetime,

350
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,500
I'll always

351
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,020
love

352
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,580
Hongying.

353
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,660
That's it.

354
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:33,860
In this lifetime,

355
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,060
I, Jianguo, will always

356
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,300
treat Hongying well.

357
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,460
I'll listen to

358
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,300
whatever

359
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,580
she says

360
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,180
and never argue with her.

361
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,420
I'll always follow

362
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,100
her lead.

363
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,620
If you're happy,

364
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,140
then I'm happy.

365
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,860
If you're not happy,

366
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,580
I'll do everything I can

367
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,620
to make you happy.

368
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,860
In this life, my duty is

369
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:58,980
to build

370
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,020
a warm harbor,

371
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,380
and you only need to rest there.

372
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,140
If you want the moon,

373
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,340
I'll get a ladder right away.

374
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,860
If I can't reach it,

375
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,580
I'll build a rocket.

376
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,980
I'll stick to my word.

377
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,620
I swear.

378
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,060
Great!

379
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:19,700
Yes, that's right.

380
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,780
Next step,

381
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,860
exchange rings.

382
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,060
Wait a moment.

383
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,740
I have something to say.

384
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,140
Everyone, I also want you

385
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,340
to witness this for me.

386
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,020
No problem.

387
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,820
The beautiful bride
will also give a speech.

388
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,140
Okay.

389
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,570
I want to thank you.

390
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,620
You don't have to.

391
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,580
It hasn't been easy for us

392
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,300
to come this far.

393
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,380
To be honest,

394
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,580
you should take most of the credit.

395
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,820
No.

396
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,140
Since we got together,

397
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,660
I've had more smiles

398
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,540
and gradually realized

399
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,220
that life

400
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,340
is actually interesting.

401
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,060
I hope

402
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,660
from now on,

403
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,060
we'll face everything together.

404
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,380
No matter where we are,

405
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,140
no matter what happens,

406
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,920
our family

407
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,780
will face it together.

408
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,180
Even if I'm

409
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,380
going to the moon...

410
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,500
Are you going to the moon?

411
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,860
Do you want to be Chang'e?

412
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,580
Even if I'm going to the moon,

413
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,460
I'll take you, my rabbit.

414
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,620
He's not a rabbit.

415
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,220
He's more like a toad.

416
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,340
You're a toad.

417
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,300
I'm Marshal Tianpeng, okay?

418
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,820
Gui, stop it.

419
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,220
Here's my second wish.

420
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,340
I hope

421
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,860
you can believe me.

422
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,580
No matter how you look,

423
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,580
I'll always be with you.

424
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,300
I'm sure everyone will

425
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,460
bless us.

426
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,620
- Great!
- Yes!

427
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,380
Xin Qiji and Li Qingzhao

428
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,380
will bless us too.

429
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,620
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

430
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,060
Come on, kiss!

431
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,580
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

432
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,020
Enough!

433
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,300
Well, yes.

434
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,580
Time to exchange rings.

435
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,420
Okay, okay.

436
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,820
My sweetie bought this, right?

437
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,340
The biggest and heaviest one.

438
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,140
Right?

439
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,340
She also bought this?

440
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,380
Yes.

441
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,820
The biggest and heaviest one.

442
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,500
Great!

443
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,220
Let's move on to the next step.

444
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,580
Tea ceremony.

445
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,580
Next,

446
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,780
tea ceremony.

447
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,620
Okay.

448
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:30,820
I...

449
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,820
I'll change it.

450
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,220
Mom,

451
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,820
I'm getting married.

452
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,780
Here's your tea.

453
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,060
Little San,

454
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,580
why are you here?

455
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,620
Mom,

456
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,300
this is your son

457
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,220
Chen Jianguo.

458
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,780
He's marrying Hongying today.

459
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,860
- Their wedding!
- Yes.

460
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,260
Mom, I'm Jianguo.

461
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,300
Mom,

462
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,140
I'm Hongying.

463
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,820
- Jianguo.
- Yes, it's Hongying.

464
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,420
Jianguo.

465
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:20,940
Good boy.

466
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,340
You're married.

467
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,020
I'm finally married.

468
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:24,860
Have some tea.

469
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,020
They're serving tea for you.

470
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,180
Be careful. It's hot.

471
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,500
- Take your time.
- Be careful.

472
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,820
Thanks.

473
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,220
Mom.

474
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,780
Here's your tea.

475
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,180
Hongying.

476
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,860
Be careful.

477
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,220
Thanks.

478
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,740
Don't return it.

479
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,740
Let me take it.

480
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,820
I don't need these.

481
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,180
For them.

482
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,340
Oh, yes.

483
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,420
Jianguo.

484
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,660
Mom.

485
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,660
Good boy.

486
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,500
Thank you, Mom.

487
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,580
You're finally married.

488
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,340
- Yes.
- I'm so happy.

489
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,580
- So happy.
- Really?

490
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,660
I'm so happy.

491
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,580
I'm really happy.

492
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,580
Thank you.

493
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,980
Congratulations!

494
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,710
Thanks! Come on.

495
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:25,860
Ceremony completed!

496
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,620
Take a guess.

497
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:01,500
Which one is from me,

498
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,660
and which one is from him?

499
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,380
This is your gift.

500
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,580
This is from Brother Xiao Han.

501
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,820
Really?

502
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,460
You guessed it so quickly.

503
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,220
Isn't it obvious?

504
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,020
Mao Tou, stuffed animal.
[*Mao: Fluffy]

505
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,340
You're both fluffy.

506
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,860
That's the reason, right?

507
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,220
It's a great day.

508
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,220
Let's take a photo.

509
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,900
Why don't you use the DV?

510
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,100
It's out of battery.

511
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,060
Let's take a photo.

512
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:25,900
Okay.

513
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,740
Ka Men, Ka Men.

514
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,540
Can you check this for me?

515
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,260
Which button should I press?

516
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,780
Isn't this your camera?

517
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,460
Oh, yes.

518
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,660
It's mine, right?

519
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,380
Alright, I'll take a photo
of you two first.

520
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,420
Okay.

521
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,820
A bit closer.

522
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:42,900
Come on.

523
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,060
Good.

524
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,300
Come on.

525
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,420
Three,

526
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,660
two,

527
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:51,860
one.

528
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,380
A sentence

529
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,260
(Reed)
or a photo.

530
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,060
Anyway,

531
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,740
I need a ceremony.

532
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,300
Why are you in this photo?

533
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,860
(Qingfeng Bridge)
The view is unique.

534
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,740
I'll take a photo.

535
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,020
Three, two, one.

536
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,200
Never mind. I'm leaving.

537
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,420
Sailor,

538
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,060
I unexpectedly completed
that ceremony today.

539
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,540
It caught me off guard,

540
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,340
but it seems I really put an end

541
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,260
to that story in my heart.

542
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,220
(Send Message, Sailor)
I read a sentence

543
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,220
by a female writer

544
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,380
that I really liked.

545
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,460
It can describe my feelings.

546
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,820
I want to share it with you.

547
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,540
Wherever I go,

548
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,540
(Our Story)
I ask,

549
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,380
"Who am I?

550
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,820
Where is this place?

551
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,140
Why did I come?

552
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:40,820
When will I leave?

553
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:41,980
Am I happy?

554
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,780
Will I miss it?"

555
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,140
I'll also ask you

556
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,340
the same questions.

557
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:47,940
Actually,

558
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,380
we're just passers-by
in each other's lives.

559
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,540
Only by saying goodbye

560
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:53,980
can we start over,

561
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,340

00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:54,820
How is it?

576
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,380
Zhang Qiming,

577
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,820
what are you doing?

578
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,860
This is the symbol

579
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,340
of family status, okay?

580
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,860
The head of the family should be here.

581
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,340
When people see this,

582
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,060
they'll know who's in charge,

583
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:10,980
right?

584
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,460
I think it looks good.

585
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:13,860
Han.

586
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,900
I'm going to use

587
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,300
my third wish now.

588
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,300
No rush.

589
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,020
I'll show you something.

590
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,140
Follow me.

591
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,620
Little imp, you...

592
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,660
Little imp,

593
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,660
what are you doing?

594
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,740
What is it?

595
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,620
Look.

596
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,460
This is the key point.

597
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,380
You're so clumsy.

598
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,220
Are you

599
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,820
really my son?

600
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,820
Why is this photo still here?

601
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,820
It's this photo again.

602
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,380
I trimmed it a little

603
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,660
and hung it here.

604
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,980
Yours is big, and mine is small.

605
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,140
I don't mind.

606
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,340
My third wish is...

607
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,660
Got it. Well,

608
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,500
Han,

609
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,620
hang your photo

610
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,540
out there.

611
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:10,900
No, I don't want to.

612
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:11,860
That spot is good.

613
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,580
Business has been smooth.

614
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,500
If you hang it there,

615
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,820
you'll perform well in the exams.

616
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,980
Hang your photo here.

617
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:19,900
Okay?

618
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,980
Okay, okay.

619
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,100
You've always wanted

620
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,220
to seize power...

621
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,820
Okay, our photos,

622
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,820
big and small,

623
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,220
will hang

624
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,580
on the wall of the bedroom.

625
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,620
It's a deal.

626
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,580
Mom, are we really hanging them?

627
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,460
It's good.

628
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,620
Hang it here.

629
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,380
You can admire beauty.

630
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,660
That's super convenient.

631
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,140
Indeed.

632
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,020
I wasn't looking at beauty.

633
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,300
I was looking

634
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,500
at that direction!

635
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,780
Where should I hang this?

636
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,740
(Puyang New Village)

637
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,020
- What a pity.
- It was a great chance.

638
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:13,980
How is that possible?

639
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:16,720
The strategies of both sides

640
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,290
have threatened each other's defense.

641
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:20,900
We have a chance.

642
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,820
Gui, Gui.

643
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,190
- Get two more cold beers.
- Okay.

644
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,460
Great offense on both sides.

645
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:32,060
Especially their right winger No. 15.

646
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,380
What a pity.

647
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,140
What a pity.

648
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,300
Gui, Gui.

649
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,100
Open it, open the beer.

650
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,580
You're at my place.

651
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,980
Why are you ordering me?

652
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,220
Why don't you just go home?

653
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:45,980
Gui.

654
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,580
Xiu'e complained that I was too loud
when watching the game.

655
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,980
She doesn't allow me to stay.

656
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,660
As for Han, Grade 12 is coming.

657
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,020
And Mao Tou

658
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:54,860
can't watch this.

659
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,210
If he's obsessed,

660
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,380
he won't be able to stop.

661
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:00,950
Sun Jihai.

662
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:09,430
Pass it in.

663
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,620
Header shot, it's a goal!

664
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,980
It's a goal!

665
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,370
Enough.

666
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,980
Take a break, guys.

667
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,020
Goal! Goal! Goal!

668
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,610
Team China leads 2-0.

669
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,820
Amazing!

670
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,660
2-0!

671
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,140
We just scored,

672
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,580
and they're praising foreigners.

673
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,580
Team China

674
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,060
will face the same situation,

675
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,660
leading first and then falling behind.

676
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,820
A few years ago,

677
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,060
in the qualifiers,

678
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,260
which country was it?

679
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,230
Iran, yes.

680
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,780
We were leading 2-0.

681
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,980
In the end, we lost 2-4.

682
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,420
Team China

683
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,540
has a weak foundation.

684
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,620
No wonder they can't play well.

685
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,660
Like this?

686
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,380
No foreign coach

687
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,380
can help them.

688
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,220
Do you know more than the coach?

689
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,260
Why do you always expect us to lose?

690
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,060
Can't we play happy football?

691
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,060
Happy football

692
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,210
is just like

693
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,500
happy study.

694
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,860
They're both lies.

695
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,220
In this world,

696
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,220
any success

697
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,300
requires effort.

698
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,780
You must work hard.

699
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,660
Because the process is painful,

700
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,380
many people give up

701
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,500
halfway,

702
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,380
whereas the one who persists to the end

703
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,660
will succeed.

704
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,900
That is the true happiness.

705
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,580
Happiness first,

706
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,580
results second.

707
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,860
If you don't enjoy the game

708
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,020
and only care about the result,

709
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,460
you'll always be worried,

710
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,340
and you'll lose.

711
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,500
Losers often make excuses

712
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,500
for their failures,

713
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,020
but history is moving

714
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,580
forward.

715
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,460
Happiness doesn't matter.

716
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,820
You're so stubborn

717
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,660
and unsympathetic.

718
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,740
You're weak and sensitive

719
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,500
like petite bourgeoisie.

720
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,100
What?

721
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,780
School's about to start.

722
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,100
Why do you have time

723
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,300
watching TV?

724
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,620
What about your homework?

725
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,810
Chen Mo.

726
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,100
I'm not going to Qingpu.

727
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,900
I won't be too busy this year.

728
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,060
During this year,

729
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,820
I'll use intense tactics

730
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:18,860
to keep an eye

731
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:19,860
on you.

732
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,140
Hurry up and study.

733
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,980
Enough, stop arguing.

734
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,620
You're just watching a game.

735
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,580
Have some fruit.

736
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,340
Come on, have some fruit.

737
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,860
Chen Pengyu,

738
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,900
didn't you say
you disdained happy football?

739
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,660
Why are you enjoying it?

740
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,860
I'm about to enter Grade 12.

741
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,500
Shouldn't you create a supportive

742
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,060
study atmosphere?

743
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,820
Set an example.

744
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,380
Put your own enjoyment aside for now.

745
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,740
I'll watch it one last time

746
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,660
how we lose a game.

747
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,780
I won't watch it next time.

748
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,490
Header goal!

749
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,780
Incredible!

750
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,380
May you soon have a precious child.

751
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,860
Guanyin.
[*Guanyin: Child-Giving Bodhisattva]

752
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,100
Goal! Goal!

753
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:25,900
Jianguo.

754
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,340
Jianjun.

755
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,060
Come here.

756
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,060
Hurry!

757
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,540
It's working.

758
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,020
It's working. Mom, come on.

759
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,540
Time for medicine.

760
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,380
Hold it.

761
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,580
Take it, and there's a reward.

762
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,540
You'll get candy.

763
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,020
Lower the volume.

764
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:42,900
Baby is

765
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,620
studying, okay?

766
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,100
Let me see.

767
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,180
Good, here's the candy.

768
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,500
Drink more water.

769
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,550
Okay.

770
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,100
Xiu'e, open the door.

771
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,220
Coming.

772
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:57,980
Bad nanny,

773
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,180
trying to drugged me.

774
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,540
Please come in.

775
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,660
Is Chairwoman Liao still up?

776
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,500
Yes, she's still awake.

777
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,620
Blessings from Guanyin.

778
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,580
May you soon have a precious child.

779
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,420
Mom.

780
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,500
Look who's here.

781
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,140
Granny.

782
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,450
Chairwoman Liao.

783
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,460
Are you watching the game?

784
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,410
Guanyin is here!

785
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:23,270
Guanyin?

786
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,470
Guanyin!

787
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:26,260
(2001, Blessings from Guanyin)

788
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,580
Great compassion and mercy.

789
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,780
You are the Jade Maiden.

790
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:35,020
She's the Jade Maiden beside Guanyin.

791
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:37,580
Guanyin.

792
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,500
My son Jianguo

793
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,340
got married.

794
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,180
Please bless him with a child soon.

795
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,020
Okay?

796
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,060
Thank you.

797
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,180
I will do my best.

798
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,380
Wait a moment.

799
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,220
What are you doing?

800
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,300
This.

801
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,580
This is my offering.

802
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,260
Thank you.

803
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,620
Okay, okay.

804
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,620
- Sorry.
- Her son bought

805
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,570
this fish oil for her last month.

806
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,660
It's precious to her.

807
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,500
She's hiding it

808
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,780
from me,

809
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:09,860
right?

810
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,180
You're laughing.

811
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,460
It's the offering.

812
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,140
- Offering.
- Hide it.

813
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:16,980
Okay, okay.

814
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,500
Thank you.

815
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,140
Sit down and watch TV,

816
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,020
- Okay.
- or your son

817
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,380
won't come back to see you.

818
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,220
Okay.

819
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,860
Go to Jiayue's room.

820
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,220
Baby.

821
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,540
Qing is here.

822
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,740
Qian Jiayue.

823
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:35,580
- Jiayue.
- Ka Men.

824
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:36,900
Wait a minute.

825
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,660
I'll finish this problem set.

826
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,700
Baby, school hasn't started.

827
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,020
Don't push yourself too hard.

828
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,580
Got it.

829
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,860
(Endure Hardship to Achieve Goals)

830
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,540
(Jiale Wontons)

831
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,580
Liu Songming, what are you doing?

832
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,060
You're not helping.

833
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,540
School is about to start.

834
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,940
They have evening classes.

835
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,380
Qing might be hungry in the afternoon.

836
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,940
I'm packing some snacks for her.

837
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,860
You're such

838
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,100
a caring dad now.

839
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,220
Of course.

840
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,060
I packed an extra bag.

841
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,940
Qing can bring it to school

842
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,660
and share it with Jiayue and Chen Mo.

843
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,900
Please don't.

844
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:21,700
What's wrong?

845
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,380
You

846
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:26,500
should split it into two packets.

847
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,020
Qing will give one

848
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,790
to Jiayue outside school

849
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:30,860
and give the other one

850
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,620
to Momo in school.

851
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,780
Okay?

852
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,780
Is it that complicated?

853
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,260
Are they still angry at each other?

854
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,220
It's been half a year.

855
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:39,940
Of course.

856
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,060
They're young

857
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,340
but complicated.

858
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,700
The buns are ready.

859
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,500
Qing is so miserable,

860
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,940
working day

861
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,060
and night.

862
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,060
No breaks at all.

863
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,140
It means Qing is popular.

864
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,580
They both need her.

865
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,580
I heard

866
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,700
half of our

867
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,500
old classmates

868
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,340
choose Science.

869
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,500
Chang Wuji, Xu You, Chen Yingying,

870
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,060
Wang Bin, and Liu Jianfeng

871
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,900
have gone to other classes.

872
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,460
And Lu Yao.

873
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,260
When he transferred here, I thought

874
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,900
it was fate
that brought us back together.

875
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,660
However,

876
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,780
I've realized

877
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,340
we're not meant to be together.

878
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,500
Even my favorite teacher Mr. Zhou

879
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,060
became the class advisor of Class 1.

880
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,500
Who do you think

881
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,860
will be our new class advisor?

882
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,460
No idea.

883
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,420
I hope it's Teacher Yuan.

884
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,980
I hope it's Teacher Zhang.

885
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,540
Hello, everyone.

886
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,220
Today is the first day of school.

887
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,380
From now on,

888
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,540
you are officially in Grade 12.

889
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,500
The College Entrance Exam is near.

890
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,220
Years of hard study

891
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,660
will finally pay off.

892
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,580
I've met most of you

893
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,580
over the past

894
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:04,860
two years.

895
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,260
We know each other.

896
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,100
However,

897
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,340
as your class advisor for Grade 12,

898
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,140
I have new and different

899
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,500
expectations of you.

900
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,980
I heard that Abbess Miejue

901
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,980
hasn't been a class advisor for years.

902
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,220
Yes.

903
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,940
(Habits)

904
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,260
I need to emphasize this.

905
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,700
Habits.

906
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,340
I brought you some snacks.

907
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,100
I believe all of you know the saying

908
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,500
"Personality determines destiny."

909
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,100
So how do we form

910
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,630
our personalities?

911
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,060
This is the answer.

912
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,620
- You want some?
- Habits

913
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,860
- You first.
- define personalities.

914
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,340
I don't care what study habits

915
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,220
you've formed over the past two years,

916
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,260
but in my class,

917
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,220
I will be strict with all of you.

918
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,380
Liu Wanqing,

919
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,980
Chen Mo, what are you doing?

920
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,580
What are you eating?

921
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:09,580
No.

922
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,740
Nothing.

923
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,420
Nothing?

924
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,420
You...

925
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,740
Take it out.

926
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,180
Take it out.

927
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,900
I brought some Butterfly Crisp.

928
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,220
Is there any left?

929
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,140
I just emphasized

930
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,180
habits.

931
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,900
Look at you.

932
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,420
It's the first day of Grade 12,

933
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,460
and you're eating in class.

934
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:53,780
Today, I'll just give

935
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:54,740
a verbal warning.

936
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,190
I don't know if the snacks

937
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,400
are enough for Qing.

938
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,500
Enough.

939
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,180
Why don't you ask me?

940
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,820
(Grade 12, Class 5)

941
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,660
Sorry about that.

942
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,410
I got you involved.

943
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,060
It was just a verbal warning.

944
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,740
We don't need to write a report.

945
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:18,500
The Butterfly Crisp was wasted.

946
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,220
I'll bring you some next time.

947
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,060
Let's eat together.

948
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:45,460
(Jiale Wontons)

949
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,740
Watch the game?

950
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,380
I think selling wontons

951
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,540
can't bring you a fortune.

952
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:53,700
Let's make a change.

953
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,540
We should

954
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:55,940
work together.

955
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:57,620
How?

956
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:58,780
Football.

957
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,020
The Top 10 Tournament.

958
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,740
Hang the flags,

959
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,220
and here we go.

960
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,620
- Everyone wants to watch it, right?
- Yes.

961
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,460
Watching it alone

962
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,420
at home is boring.

963
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,060
With your wife standing next to you

964
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,340
and staring at you,

965
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,380
you can't turn up the volume

966
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,580
or make any noises.

967
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:16,820
If there is

968
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,620
a place

969
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,660
where you can yell

970
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,060
and scream

971
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,420
with

972
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,420
some drinks

973
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:25,580
and late-night snacks...

974
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,500
Besides,

975
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,580
no one will bother you.

976
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,580
Our shop can be the place.

977
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,460
Zhang Qiming.

978
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,180
Like I said, you're really

979
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,020
smart.

980
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:36,860
Yes.

981
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,500
Are you excited?

982
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,260
Listen,

983
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,100
there's something special.

984
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:42,940
What is it?

985
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:43,900
Look,

986
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,060
let's make

987
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,420
a World Cup Combo.

988
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:50,600
We'll have some wontons,

989
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,570
one fried pork chop,

990
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:54,770
two small dishes,

991
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:57,170
and two bottles of beer.

992
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:58,970
It's a combo.

993
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:00,570
50 yuan.

994
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:03,290
50 yuan?

995
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:05,690
It's only worth 14 yuan,

996
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:06,730
and now it's 50 yuan?

997
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:08,810
That's too expensive.

998
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:10,770
Who would pay for that?

999
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:11,730
- Exactly.
- Yes.

1000
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:13,050
It must be 50 yuan.

1001
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:15,090
There's something special.

1002
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:17,330
You have to buy this combo.

1003
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:19,290
When Team China wins,

1004
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:20,850
you'll get a raffle ticket.

1005
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:23,170
After the group stage ends,

1006
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:24,970
everyone will bring
their raffle tickets,

1007
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:27,410
and we'll have a mysterious grand prize.

1008
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:28,970
What prize?

1009
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:30,830
That is

1010
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:32,670
the photo

1011
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:34,030
of the most popular man in the world,

1012
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:36,150
David Beckham,

1013
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:38,630
with his autograph.

1014
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:40,870
Isn't it amazing?

1015
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:42,750
It's David Beckham

1016
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:43,710
with an autograph!

1017
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:44,550
Let me see.

1018
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:45,430
You can't see it now.

1019
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,590
If you make 100 copies,

1020
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:47,750
mine won't be valuable.

1021
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,510
- You can't.
- Hands off.

1022
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:51,190
Aiping.

1023
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:53,470
Look, he's so handsome.

1024
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:55,190
Handsome.

1025
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:56,190
So handsome.

1026
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,230
Handsome? Just look at me.

1027
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:00,390
Nothing special about him.

1028
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:02,790
When do we start?

1029
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:04,670
A thousand years is too long.

1030
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:06,590
We must seize the day!

1031
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:13,150
