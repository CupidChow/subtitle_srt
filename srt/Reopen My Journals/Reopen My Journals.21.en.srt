(Jiale Wontons)

25
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,350
Next time,

26
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,540
besides wontons and noodles,

27
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,900
you can also order stir-fried dishes
and cold appetizers.

28
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,500
They're not on the menu,

29
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,800
but the neighbors can order them.

30
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,910
He's not a neighbor.

31
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,470
But he's my friend, and Ka Men's too.

32
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,170
I brought him here to eat.

33
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,110
What are you doing here?

34
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,440
What...

35
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,040
What am I doing here?

36
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,240
I'm here to ask you...

37
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,470
to tutor me!

38
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:07,670
Yes,

39
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,790
math...

40
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,400
I don't understand these two questions.

41
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,320
Can you help me

42
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,630
with these two?

43
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:19,600
How about...

44
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,840
you go find Brother Xiao Han to help you?

45
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,750
I'm not good at this.

46
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,910
I don't want to.

47
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:26,790
Why?

48
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,070
He...

49
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,910
I can't understand his explanations!

50
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:35,790
Chang Wuji

51
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,630
is the best at math in our class.

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,510
Can you help him out?

53
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,120
No problem.

54
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,040
No, no.

55
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,000
Don't bother.

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It won't work either.

57
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,510
I talked to Godmother about

58
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,680
how someone at my level
should only be taught

59
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,120
by average students, like you.

60
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,440
Do you even want to study seriously?

61
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,000
Maybe he's not being lazy.

62
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,190
Even if he works hard,

63
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,440
it is neither a sufficient condition nor even

64
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,000
a necessary one

65
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,630
for being good at studies.

66
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,840
Why are you talking about
the necessary condition too?

67
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,880
Jiayue, the sweet lotus root and
braised duck legs are ready. Come.

68
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,240
Wuji.

69
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,040
Qian Jiayue can't carry all that
by herself.

70
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,120
Go help her.

71
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,190
Okay.

72
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,070
- Thanks a lot.
- No problem.

73
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,820
(Jinxiu Garden)

74
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,120
What are you doing, Old Zhang?

75
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,310
Mao Tou,

76
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,570
about your goal
of getting into No. 2 Middle School,

77
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:15,770
I've thought it over carefully,

78
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,470
and I've decided to support you.

79
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:20,910
He arrived right after you.

80
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,480
Who?

81
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,630
Xiao Han.

82
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,840
To support

83
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:25,870
your goal,

84
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,720
I've asked him

85
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,040
to tutor you every night.

86
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,430
- Coming!
- Wait, wait!

87
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,790
I didn't even know

88
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,870
how you arranged all this?

89
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,430
Listen, no matter what,

90
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,430
you have to agree to it.

91
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,690
I've set everything up.

92
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,310
Just act like you understand his teaching.

93
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,300
As long as he tutors you,

94
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,640
I can pay him for his time.

95
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,910
This way, I can secretly

96
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:41,960
relieve your Auntie Guan's

97
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,110
financial pressure.

98
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,110
Got it? Coming!

99
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,120
Mr. Zhang.

100
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,070
Come on in.

101
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,990
Hi, Brother Xiao Han.

102
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,600
My dad says

103
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:57,910
he'll pay you for the tutoring.

104
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,280
You know, my dad means well.

105
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,990
He just wants to indirectly

106
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,430
give money to your mom.

107
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,080
That's inappropriate!

108
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,350
See? I told you

109
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,200
he wouldn't agree.

110
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,880
Mr. Zhang,

111
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,520
Mao Tou is like my brother.

112
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,160
Helping him is what I should do.

113
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,430
No need for any payment.

114
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,470
Mao Tou, don't be so formal with me.

115
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,880
Wait!

116
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,310
I've been tutored before.

117
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,400
It was Qian Jiayue.

118
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,620
- Her grades are average.
- Her grades are average.

119
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,190
Come.

120
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,490
The first question, wrong.

121
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,790
The second, wrong.

122
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,670
So is the fourth.

123
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,600
Why didn't you answer the third one?

124
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,310
Actually, these mistakes

125
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,720
are the same as the ones
in the last test.

126
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,790
Compare and

127
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,190
think it over.

128
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,970
I shouldn't have left this to you.

129
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:10,870
My oversight.

130
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,040
Let me help you.

131
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,990
Give it to me.

132
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,400
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.

133
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,000
Han,

134
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,400
actually,

135
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,910
I need to ask a favor.

136
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,040
Go ahead.

137
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,550
That little imp

138
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,920
wants to enter No. 2 Middle School,

139
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,400
but you know his level.

140
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,430
If Mao Tou

141
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,110
works hard from now on,

142
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,960
there's still a chance.

143
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,910
You're just comforting me.

144
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,430
But honestly,

145
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,790
that kid

146
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,080
is showing some rare ambition.

147
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,110
As a father,

148
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,670
I have to do my part, right?

149
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,000
Han,

150
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,160
you've been at your school

151
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,640
for a while now.

152
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,600
I heard you're the...

153
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,790
union's... no,

154
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,310
student council's...

155
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,840
- Chairman.
- So you must be close

156
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,870
with the teachers there.

157
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,400
I was wondering,

158
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,550
do you know

159
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,110
any other ways to get into

160
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,070
No. 2 Middle School?

161
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,600
Other ways?

162
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,440
You know...

163
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,230
I really don't know of any other ways.

164
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,430
I understand.

165
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,870
Well... about that Chen Mo,

166
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,280
you know her, right?

167
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,760
I heard she got into

168
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,200
your school through connections.

169
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,470
Could you help me

170
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,670
ask her in some way?

171
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:27,830
Why not...

172
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,550
Jiayue's mom is close with

173
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,390
Chen Mo's mom.

174
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,200
Maybe she can ask her.

175
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:35,830
Or...

176
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,870
Jiayue could ask Chen Mo directly.

177
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,560
I'll go back now.

178
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,670
Okay. Be careful.

179
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:42,750
Is it too hot?

180
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,760
I'll add some cold water next time.

181
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,070
Mr. Zhang,

182
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,480
actually,

183
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,840
I can just ask her

184
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,200
directly.

185
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,920
Thank you.

186
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,120
No problem.

187
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,430
Hello?

188
00:08:53,980 --> 00:09:00,260
(Class 5, Grade 10)

189
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,070
It hurts!

190
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,040
Doesn't it hurt for you?

191
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,120
Now you feel the pain.

192
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,120
Is it Lu Yao's turn now?

193
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,590
Come on, I'm not scared of you!

194
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,910
Bring it on if you dare to!

195
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,240
- I will.
- Go... go ahead.

196
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,360
- Okay, okay!
- Go ahead.

197
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,240
Xiao Han.

198
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:24,550
Xiao Han!

199
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,120
What're you doing?

200
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,270
Do me a favor.

201
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:33,000
You really dare to hit me!

202
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,160
- Chen Mo.
- So what?

203
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,480
- Chen Mo!
- Wang!

204
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,760
- What?
- Come here!

205
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,590
Let me show you a book.

206
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,400
What book? Something good?

207
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,040
I won! I won!

208
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,000
What?

209
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,550
This is your own fault, Lu Yao!

210
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,760
- What?
- You really dare to hit me!

211
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,000
What?

212
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,000
Thanks, big star.

213
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,160
You're welcome!

214
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,480
You!

215
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,640
We'll continue this next break!

216
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,480
Oh no!

217
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,320
Chen Mo!

218
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,120
Xiao Han asked for you.

219
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,830
What's the matter?

220
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,640
What can't be said in the classroom?

221
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,360
Why the secrecy?

222
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,790
I've been asked to ask you something.

223
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,600
How did you get into our school?

224
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,310
Mao Tou wants to get in too.

225
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,480
They want to know
if you have any connections.

226
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,830
What do you mean?

227
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,240
You got nothing better to do?

228
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,480
Nothing better?

229
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,310
Oh, I'm not as busy as you.

230
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,760
You're always joking around

231
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,670
and fooling around.

232
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,810
You're so busy during breaks.

233
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,830
You even don't have time to meet people.

234
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:31,000
Did the student council merge with
the Academic Affairs Office?

235
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,830
I've just been joking around

236
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,670
and fooling around.

237
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,030
Have I broken any school rules?

238
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,160
Chairman Xiao, who are you to discipline me?

239
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,510
In your eyes,

240
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,310
just because I don't do well in my studies,

241
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,730
I shouldn't even be
in the same school as you, right?

242
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,430
I didn't mean it that way.

243
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,670
It doesn't matter.

244
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,640
Like I care.

245
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:22,460
(Integrity, Diligence,
Responsibility, Virtue)

246
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,400
No need.

247
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,540
What I give away,

248
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,590
I never plan to take back.

249
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,280
I don't want to owe you a favor.

250
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:43,880
Then just throw it away.

251
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,430
Yang Shu, don't forget

252
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,760
to play CS after school.

253
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,160
We'll compete against
No. 2 Middle School next week.

254
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,280
We need to practice more.

255
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,480
Okay.

256
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,190
We lost by 30-plus lives last time.

257
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,760
Hope we lose less this time.

258
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,240
You lost that badly?

259
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,040
They're really strong!

260
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,150
Yeah.

261
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,710
Boss, if you were there,

262
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,830
they would have lost badly.

263
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,640
Boss, how about we go together today?

264
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,310
Yeah, let's go.

265
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,480
We miss you.

266
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,960
Not going.

267
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,760
Your boss has to go home and study.

268
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:42,670
Boss!

269

271
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,080
necessary conditions.

272

Mao Tou.

275
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,190
This is a night snack

276
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,710
Han's mom made for you.

277
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,710
Chicken soup wontons.

278
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,240
Here you are.

279
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:46,910
What...

280
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,200
does this...

281
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,360
mean?

282
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,760
"Hang the head,

283
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,040
pierce the thigh."

284
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,150
Ever heard of it?

285
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,670
Are you out of your mind?

286
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,640
Let me tell you again.

287
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,160
It's good if you get in,

288
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,550
but it doesn't matter if you don't.

289
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,160
Health is most important!

290
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,670
Remember, don't…

291
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:12,910
Stop messing around.

292
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,310
Just leave, okay?

293
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,520
You're interrupting my studies.

294
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,710
Fine, fine.

295
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,360
Drink the soup.

296
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,320
Eat the wontons.

297

Go to bed early.

298

Don't study too late.

299
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:23,360

303

Where to sign?

304

Father, please grant me your words!

305
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,310
What's there to grant?

306
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,140
"Fei qin wang shi"!
[*Skip sleep and meals]

307

You… You…

308
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,280
Are you my real father?

309
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,520
If you are, grant me your words.

310
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,240
Fine, I'll grant them!

311
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,760
"Fei qin wang shi"?

312
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,790
I'll pop that pimple for you.

313
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,070
Fine, I'll grant you my words.

314
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:09,760
Which "fei"?

315
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,670
Used on me, meaning

316
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,510
"good-for-nothing".

317
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,040
How can you belittle yourself like this?

318

(Lung)

319
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,120
"Qin"...

320
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,600
"Qin"...

321
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,840
"Qin".

322
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,950
The one meaning "a treat"...

323
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,070
Which is definitely wrong.

324
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,320
Make it simple!

325
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,040
Done.

326
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,520
Let me remind you.

327
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,070
Don't let the exams

328
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,430
drive you crazy!

You're my only son!

332

I'll swap it out for a fan.

333

Once you hook your head to it,

334
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,630
the fan will spin, and you'll fly.

380
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,480
Bomb planted!
Boss, it's just you left!

381
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,870
- Be careful!
- Boss, stay safe!

382
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,390
Take him down!

383
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,760
Great positioning, boss!

384
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,830
Shoot! Shoot!

385
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:53,670
Keep going, boss!

386
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,310
- Invincible!
- Only one enemy left!

387
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,680
Shoot! Shoot!

388
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,520
Unbelievable! Boss, you won a 1v4!

389
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,550
This isn't that impressive.

390
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,070
CS is just a game.

391
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:04,960
Boss plays it casually.

392
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,110
You haven't seen

393
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,240
him playing StarCraft, right?

394
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,960
His skills were dazzling!

395
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,280
- We were all…
- Enough.

396
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,310
Save it. Are we playing or not?

397
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,150
Let's play.

398
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,760
Boss, if you were in Korea,

399
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,310
you'd definitely be a top talent

400
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,350
in an e-sports club.

401
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,480
I can't even imagine it.

402
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,440
That'd be amazing.

403
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,280
Nice.

404
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,150
Zhang Yang made significant progress
this time.

405
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,080
You passed.

406
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,870
Don't you know how badly

407
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:44,090
you've been doing
in your exams since childhood?

408
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:46,470
Not everyone

409
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,680
can get into No. 2 Middle School.

410
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,040
Unbelievable! Boss,

411
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,960
you won a 1v4!

412
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,630
Boss, if you were in Korea,

413
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,070
you'd be a top talent

414
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,910
in an e-sports club.

415
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,490
(Korean StarCraft player Temmer
wins SOJ Championship,)

416
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,860
(awarded National Outstanding Youth
by the government)

417
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,180
(Thanks to his deep understanding of the game,)

418
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,990
(he became the best
in StarCraft at the time,)

419
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,660
(opening a new path
for young people.)

420
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,020
(Yingmo Community)

421
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,150
A competition?

422
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,480
What kind of competition?

423
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,110
E-sports.

424
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,520
It's…

425
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,310
computer game competitions.

426
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:40,590
What's that?

427
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,000
I've never heard of it.

428
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,440
What's Mao Tou messing around with?

429
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,680
Turning gaming into a career?

430
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Who's going to pay him?

431
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,390
According to him,

432
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,630
it's just like sports competitions.

433
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,040
Like the A-league,

434
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,830
there are clubs everywhere.

435
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,880
Like the A-league,

436
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,200
where there are clubs everywhere,

437
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,480
and they can compete.

438
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,550
The key is,

439
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,040
there are sponsors.

440
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,480
The players can not only
make a lot of money,

441
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,110
but they can even
become stars in the future.

442
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:08,480
Mao Tou,

443
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,520
I understand how you're feeling.

444
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:14,070
But you can't start making excuses

445
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,630
to run away just because it's tough.

446
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,630
Is the target, No. 2 Middle School,

447
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:20,830
too high for him?

448
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,040
Is that

449
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,390
why he's backing out now?

450
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,550
Can't take it anymore?

451
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,870
I think Mao Tou's
in that kind of situation.

452
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,680
I'm not backing out!

453
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,150
My dad said,

454
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,590
"Shrimp has its own path,

455
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,430
and so does a crab."

456
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:34,830
Every road leads to Rome!

457
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,590
Everyone can be successful
in their field!

458
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,350
Shrimp and crab have their own paths.

459
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,390
People are different.

460
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,620
You can't be thinking about

461
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,200
getting into a good school one minute

462
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,550
and playing video games the next.

463
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,310
It's like… after signing a contract,

464
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,550
I realized it wasn't making money,

465
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:47,920
so I just tore it up.

466
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,790
Attitude is a matter of principle!

467
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,890
If he does this,

468
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:52,440
he'll be good for nothing in the future!

469
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,590
Forget the future,

470
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:57,000
even right now, this is very important.

471
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,310
We can't just agree to him

472
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,720
dropping out of school.

473
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,800
That's right.

474
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:01,670
Even if

475
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,270
he doesn't get into a good school,

476
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,520
he has to continue school.

477
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,600
In terms of

478
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:06,550
schooling,

479
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,920
I'm worse than you two,

480
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,550
so I don't have a say.

481
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,040
But I can't be worse than you two

482
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,960
in everything, can I?

483
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,600
In the future,

484
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,760
I want to become

485
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,960
an excellent e-sports player.

486
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,330
Maybe I'll make it to the international stage

487
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,040
and bring glory to our country!

488
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,760
Continuing school is a must.

489
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,020
Even if he doesn't
get into a good school,

490
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,760
he still has to go to
a regular one.

491
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,960
He has to take
the zhongkao!

492
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,140
He can't stop his education.

493
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,040
You, as his father,

494
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,440
need to think of something.

495
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,870
By the way, Chen Mo

496
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,830
isn't good in class either,

497
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,240
but she still got into
No. 2 Middle School.

498
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,760
That means her dad, Chen Pengyu,

499
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,240
has some connections.

500
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,630
Why don't you try talking to him?

501
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,760
I asked Han to talk to Chen Mo.

502
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,550
You asked Han to ask?

503
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,040
How can a kid

504
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,760
ask about adult matters?

505
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,520
I'm not as good at gaming as you,

506
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,610
but you have to know competitive gaming

507
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:00,390
is really tough.

508
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,070
Only a tiny group of people

509
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,390
at the very top

510
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,760
can make a living from it.

511
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,880
Look at me,

512
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,390
I like playing basketball,

513
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,200
and it's fun as a hobby.

514
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,790
If you like computer games,

515
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,200
when you get to college,

516
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,110
you could major in something related.

517
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,280
That's a good path too.

518
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,360
Yeah,

519
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,920
Brother Xiao Han's right.

520
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,470
Mao Tou…

521
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:20,550
Enough. That's enough.

522
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,760
You don't believe in me.

523
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,600
I can tell that.

524
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,600
How about this:

525
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,560
play a round with me.

526
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,960
If you win…

527
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:27,970
No, wait.

528
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,110
You guys go find someone.

529
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:30,920
If you can find someone who beats me,

530
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,240
I, Zhang Yang, swear

531
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,870
I'll never touch a computer game again,

532
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,920
and focus on study.

533
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:36,230
Deal?

534
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,760
He can even play games?

535
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,040
He can.

536
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,590
This is the game Brother Xiao Han

537
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,550
taught us.

538
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:57,870
He's just warming up.

539
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:58,960
He'll definitely win.

540
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,480
He will win, right?

541
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,760
I think so.

542
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,700
(Victory)

543
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,870
The younger generation always comes up

544
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,760
and takes the place of the older one.

545
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,040
It's been a while.

546
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,760
I'm out of practice.

547
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,440
There's still hope.

548
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,200
Easy-peasy.

549
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,790
Don't worry. I got this.

550
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,900
(Victory)

551
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:27,520
Keep attacking him,

552
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,960
then mass up your troops!

553
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:36,760
I know his strategy.

554
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,790
He loves to sneak attack from behind.

555
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,550
To win,

556
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,760
strengthen your defense first,

557
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,830
then send out your troops.

558
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,080
Right?

559
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,150
Hey, you need troops!

560
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,630
You... You need troops for that!

561
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,870
Just prepare troops first!

562
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,350
Don't distract me. I got this.

563
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,580
(Victory)

564
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,030
(Sailor)
Lately, my skills

565
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,590
have finally made everyone notice me.

566
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,070
This feels so amazing!

567
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,920
Congratulations.

568
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,000
How's everything with you?

569
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,760
You seem a bit down.

570
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,870
It's a long story.

571
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,720
I just spent three hours studying a game,

572
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,280
but I haven't made any progress.

573
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,560
Not surprising.

574
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,830
Gaming requires talent too.

575
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,490
(Reed)
If you have someone

576
00:26:58,490 --> 00:26:59,680
good at gaming around you,

577
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,790
make sure to appreciate them.

578
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,390
By the way, I'm curious,

579
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,720
are you good at StarCraft?

580
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,820
(Reed)

581
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:10,290
I…

582
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,110
not really, I don't even know
how to play.

583
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:15,230
I'm logging off now.

584
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:16,440
Something just came up.

585
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:34,550
I'm back.

586
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,760
A whole day of meetings. I'm wiped out.

587
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,870
Mr. Chen, you're back.

588
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,440
We've got a guest.

589
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,520
You're back.

590
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,340
- Here.
- Mrs. Chen, it's very kind of you.

591
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:46,910
Thank you.

592
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,110
Chen, this is an old friend of mine.

593
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:52,630
He's...

594
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,150
Xiao Han's mother's...

595
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,230
partner.

596
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,630
Zhang Qiming. He lives right upstairs.

597
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,390
- Nice to meet you.
- Take a seat.

598
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,230
Please, have a seat.

599
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,200
Qiming came to

600
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,480
consult with you about something.

601
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,880
I just arrived.

602
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,520
I haven't had a chance

603
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,070
to bring it up.

604
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,590
My son Mao Tou

605
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,350
is really focused now.

606
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,940
He wants to study hard to get into

607
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,040
No. 2 Middle School.

608
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,280
Mr. Chen, I heard

609
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,280
you have

610
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,480
some connections
with No. 2 Middle School.

611
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,040
If it's convenient, could you

612
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,390
help us with an introduction?

613
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:30,830
If there's

614
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,590
any referral fee or sponsorship fee,

615
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:33,920
I'm fine with that.

616
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,480
Just help us...

617
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:42,710
No. 2 Middle School?

618
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:43,630
Yes, yes.

619
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,280
I have connections?

620
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:46,760
How come

621
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,070
I don't know about it myself?

622
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,520
What connections do I even have?

623
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,170
What's his family name?

624
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,430
Zhang?

625
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,670
Li?

626
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,120
Wang?

627
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,200
Zhao?

628
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,160
Mr. Chen, please don't take it that way.

629
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,070
- Chen.
- Shut up.

630
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:13,200
I made a mistake.

631
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,550
It's mere hearsay.

632
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,550
I'm really sorry.

633
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,550
- It's fine.
- Well...

634
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,200
this is a gift from Wuyi Mountains.

635
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,350
Some tea leaves.

636
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,550
This is Narcissus tea, tasting great.

637
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:24,630
And Fuding white tea

638
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,580
for soothing your throat

639
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,440
when it feels sore.

640
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,070
I'm sorry!

641
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:30,000
I've made a fool of myself!

642
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
- It's us who feel sorry, Qiming.
- Sorry, sorry.

643
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,240
I really am sorry!

644
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,800
Mr. Zhang,

645
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,830
there's no free lunch.

646
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,040
Take it back.

647
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,350
No, no.

648
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,590
We're neighbors.

649
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:44,520
I'll leave empty-handed,

650
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:45,920
just a bit more carefree.

651
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,920
I can't take it back.
Please try the tea...

652
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,920
If the neighbors see us,

653
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,480
it wouldn't look good.

654
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:54,960
You're right.

655
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:56,960
I didn't think

656
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,040
this through.

657
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,480
I'll take them back.

658
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,120
Qiming,

659
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,060
come by

660
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:02,960
another time.

661
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,870
No problem!

662
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,790
Mr. Chen, goodbye.

663
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:06,760
- Goodbye.
- Okay, okay.

664
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,390
Sorry about all that!

665
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,920
Mrs. Chen, no need to see me off.

666
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,280
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

667
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:24,710
Chen,

668
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,240
don't you think

669
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,830
that was a little too harsh?

670
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,350
Before I even said a word,

671
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,200
you started blaming me.

672
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,070
Didn't I tell you before?

673
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,830
Anyone who tries to

674
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,590
use me for connections or favors,

675
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,790
gets turned away at the door.

676
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,040
Don't you care about national laws?

677
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,830
But Mr. Zhang's company doesn't even

678
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:51,670
do business

679
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,500
with your company.

680
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,800
Besides,

681
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,310
we're neighbors.

682
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,000
If you have a reason,

683
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,240
just tell him straight up.

684
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:00,920
You didn't need to

685
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,550
act so aloof.

686
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,390
It just makes him feel worse.

687
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,040
Me acting

688
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,350
aloof?

689
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,200
Let's talk about you.

690
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,690
Me?

691
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,490
What kind of people
are you associating with?

692
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:15,720
You're bringing

693
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,070
all sorts of people home!

694
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,870
Ever since we moved here,

695
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,480
you've been

696
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,200
hanging out with that group of

697
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,200
small-town friends,

698
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,760
talking about gossip.

699
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:28,310
They're all my good friends!

700
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:34,880
Zhao Rongfang,

701
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:37,110
you really need to think about this.

702
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:38,790
Why do these people

703
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,520
think Momo got into No. 2 Middle School

704
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,240
through some

705
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,440
back door

706
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,310
or through me pulling strings?

707
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,350
Can you use your brain

708
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,630
and think?

709
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,590
Did you say something misleading outside?

710
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:54,830
I didn't say anything!

711
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,000
Momo got into No. 2 Middle School

712
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,870
because we hired
several top-tier teachers,

713
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,960
and she studied for months.

714
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,590
How could I possibly say

715
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,480
she got in through the back door?

716
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,550
There's no smoke

717
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,920
without fire,

718
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,230
right?

719
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:11,470
Also,

720
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,930
if your precious daughter's grades

721
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,240
were a bit better,

722
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,440
would they have

723
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,480
that impression?

724
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,800
Would they?

725
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,280
It's all because of your spoiling!

726
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,630
She's becoming harder to manage.

727
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,790
You're spoiling her.

728
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,220
(Jiale Wontons)

729
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:41,710
Pei,

730
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,590
did you strike it rich?

731
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,240
What's with this giant fruit basket

732
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,830
sitting here for a show?

733
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,440
I'm just borrowing some good fortune.

734
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,440
From whom?

735
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:52,200
Zhang Qiming bought it.

736
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:55,150
What's gotten into him?

737
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,190
Look at it.

738
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,870
The fruit is so nice.
It must have cost a lot.

739
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:01,520
He could've just

740
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,790
treated us to a meal instead.

741
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,520
Isn't it because of you?

742
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:05,960
You told him

743
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,520
to ask Chen Mo's father for help

744
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,590
to get some connections.

745
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,480
So it's a gift?

746
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,000
Then why is it just sitting here?

747
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,830
He got a cold reception.

748
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:18,630
He told me,

749
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,200
Mr. Chen didn't even let him

750
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:20,840
finish his tea

751
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,070
before showing him the door.

752
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,070
You know,

753
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,110
that sounds like

754
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,760
something Chen Pengyu would do.

755
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,440
But it's unfair to Fangfang.

756
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,520
Fangfang is

757
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,720
so sensible,

758
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,790
beautiful,

759
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:34,760
and fashionable.

760
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,720
How did she end up with a guy like him?

761
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,520
I used to think Chen Pengyu

762
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,590
was an ideal husband.

763
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,550
College graduate, well-educated,
manager of a state-owned enterprise…

764
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:46,040
And having a driver with white gloves.

765
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,680
You really

766
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,200
hold a grudge, don't you?

767
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,680
I do. It's your fault for saying that.

768
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,680
By the way, can I still go to Fangfang's?

769
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,000
I was planning

770
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,240
to borrow something from her.

771
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,200
- Borrow what?
- What is it?

772
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,040
An English tape.

773
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:07,390
English...

774
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,800
Still learning English?

775
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,270
- Why?
- The flight attendant interview was over!

776
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,440
You still want to learn...

777
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,040
"Tomato juice"?

778
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,840
"Apple juice"?

779
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,680
Stop!

780
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,590
Not for me!

781
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:21,630
It's for Qian Kang!

782
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,230
May I help you?

783
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,800
(Safe Travel)
I'm sorry for that.

784
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:27,940
(Available)

785
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,190
Let's say it again.

786
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,630
May I help...

787
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,440
May I help you?

788
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,190
Okay. Very good.

789
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,470
Hello, sir, where are you headed?

790
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,150
- Huating Hotel.
- Okay.

791
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,110
How old are you?

792
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,550
Sorry to disturb you.

793
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,390
It is too loud.

794
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,200
Okay,

795
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:46,100
I just turned it off.

796
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,360
How... are you?

797
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,360
You forgot the word "old".

798
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,880
What you said is the greeting,
"How are you?"

799
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,840
The greeting, "How are you?"

800
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,670
"How old are you?"

801
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,670
Is that a more polite way to say it?

802
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,000
Like "How are you, old one?"

803
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,040
Beijing people

804
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,320
seems to say it that way.

805
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:17,150
"How old are you?"

806
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,440
Reverse it.

807
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,680
You...

808
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:21,070
are how old?

809
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,750
It means

810
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,630
asking someone's age.

811
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,230
Right, right!

812
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,880
Sorry about that.

813
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,190
Our company

814
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,670
encourages us to learn English

815
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,040
to help get

816
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,000
the "five-star driver" certification.

817
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:37,630
Shanghai is an international city,

818
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,630
and taxi drivers

819
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,000
are its front-line ambassadors.

820
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,630
You need to learn well.

821
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,670
You'll make it.

822
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,270
At my age,

823
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,960
learning isn't easy.

824
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,800
Pretty tough.

825
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,190
That's not how you should think.

826
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,800
Let me tell you,

827
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,070
when I was in college,

828
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,070
the oldest guy in our class

829
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:58,110
was...

830
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,670
almost forty.

831
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,320
But he

832
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,840
was still contributing to our country.

833
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:04,590
So,

834
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,150
don't waste your time

835
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,000
or just get by.

836
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,800
Learn seriously.

837
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,150
How would you ask someone's age?

838
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,280
How are...

839
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,440
How old are you?

840
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,800
Yes.

841
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,360
Very good. Very good.

842
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,840
When you drop me off,

843
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,110
leave me your contact info.

844
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,040
I might call you when needed.

845
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,000
Thank you! Thank you!

846
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,320
Lu Yao.

847
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,630
You meet a lot of people
at the TV station.

848
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,960
Do you know anyone

849
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,550
who's really good at gaming?

850
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,110
Gaming?

851
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,590
Is it still about Mao Tou?

852
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,270
Still, no one has beaten him?

853
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,190
I really don't believe it!

854
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,360
Can he really make a career
out of gaming?

855
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,190
Alright, I'll keep an eye out.

856
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,710
How about...

857
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,040
I give it a try?

858
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,800
Have you eaten yet? Let me have the chef

859
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,630
prepare some braised lion's head

860
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,580
and crispy eel for you.

861
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,440
The specialties.

862
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,150
No need. I've already eaten.

863
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,960
Why did you come here?

864
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,550
Weren't you supposed to

865
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,440
be at the clinic studying and working?

866
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,690
I'm worried about you,

867
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,150
so I came early to check on you.

868
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:04,630
I called,

869
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:05,630
but your phone was off.

870
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,670
I asked Wang about your whereabouts.

871
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:12,270
Yeah,

872
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:14,880
the battery died, so it turned off.

873
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,320
Sit down, sit down.

874
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,800
How's everything?

875
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,800
Did anyone here have connections?

876
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,440
No luck.

877
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,040
I've got another dinner.

878
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,160
It's also here.

879
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:32,960
You drank a lot, right?

880
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,480
I've told you before,

881
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:37,150
drink less at business dinners.

882
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,090
That little imp wanting to get into

883
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,630
No. 2 Middle School is driving me crazy.

884
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,880
When I was young,

885
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,630
I thought making money was everything,

886
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,670
but now I see

887
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,040
it's all nothing.

888
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:53,710
I didn't spend enough time

889
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,100
with my parents in their last years,

890
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,670
and with Mao Tou when he was growing up.

891
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,550
Every time I come home,

892
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,480
he locks himself in his room.

893
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:04,270
I don't even have anyone to talk to.

894
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:06,070
I'm just alone.

895
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,400
It's tragic!

896
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:10,040
You are not alone, okay?

897
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,840
Dalang,

898
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,150
time for your herbal medicine.

899
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,190
What's this?

900
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:16,960
Stop making jokes.

901
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:19,190
This is liver protection tea
I made for you.

902
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,400
Thank you.

903
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,230
On the outside,

904
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:28,040
everything seems fine,

905
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,750
but when I really need help,

906
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,150
there's no one to turn to.

907
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,240
It's all in vain.

908
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,640
Qiming,

909
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,440
do you know…

910
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,230
we used to envy you?

911
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,440
Envy me? For what?

912
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,190
When we all lost our jobs,

913
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:52,090
we spent every day at home,

914
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,040
doing nothing,

915
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,920
just worrying about

916
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,710
our next meal

917
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,240
and what the future

918
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,400
would bring.

919
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:01,670
But you...

920
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,960
you were different.

921
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:05,840
You were out there, full of energy,

922
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,710
doing whatever you wanted,

923
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,670
going wherever you wanted.

924
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,070
It felt like

925
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:14,550
we had been abandoned by the times,

926
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,240
and only you

927
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,550
were riding the wave.

928
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,800
Speaking of which,

929
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:20,940
last time I went to Myanmar

930
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:23,070
to help a friend from
the City God Temple import jade,

931
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,190
I almost didn't make it back.

932
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,880
Riding the wave?

933
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,360
Right now, I'm just a drowned rat.

934
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,590
I just want to tell you,

935
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:36,150
what you do isn't in vain.

936
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,720
Think about it,

937
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:40,000
no one's life is perfect,

938
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,320
and no one's parents are perfect either.

939
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,270
When Mao Tou was young,

940
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,960
you didn't give him enough of your time.

941
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,360
Now,

942
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,190
just communicate with him more.

943
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,630
It's never too late.

944
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,190
I do want to do that,

945
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,440
but every time I try,

946
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,750
we end up fighting.

947
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,800
That kid

948
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,960
has gotten so stubborn and rebellious.

949
00:40:59,110 --> 00:40:59,950
It's so hard.

950
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,000
Then try something different.

951
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,670
Maybe write him a letter?

952
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,590
My handwriting looks like a crab walking.

953
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,270
How can I write him a letter?

954
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,480
Give it a try.

955
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,800
How will you know unless you try?

956
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,240
Give it a try?

957
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:29,480
What are you doing?

958
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:30,800
Go home and write it.

959
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,630
At least make a rough draft first.

960
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,550
Let me organize my thoughts first.

961
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:37,840
I need to think about what to write.

962
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,670
How's this?

963
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:00,670
Want to check first?

964
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:05,730
Aiping,

965
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:09,040
you're working
and studying traditional Chinese medicine.

966
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:10,550
Is it tiring?

967
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,750
I really feel for you.

968
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:27,190
I don't want to be all alone.

969
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:30,000
Will you spend more time with me?

970
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,000
How's this thought?

971
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:54,590
Aiping,

972
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,960
I want to take care of you
for the rest of my life.
