=Episode 11=

24
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,960
Aiping, I'm back.

25
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,070
I bought an old hen

26
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,200
from Small Pudong.

27
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,040
I'll make chicken soup for you.

28
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,960
You sneak,

29
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,720
you freaked me out!

30
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,510
You have the key?

31
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,950
How do you have the key?

32
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,590
Any problem?

33
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,000
She gave it to me this morning.

34
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,310
Why were you here this morning?

35
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,200
That's a funny question.

36
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,870
I took her to the hospital last night.

37
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,000
So, why were you here

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,560
last night?

39
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,040
Are you the "100,000 Whys"?
Do you work for the KGB?

40
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,560
So nosy.

41
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,430
I won't tell you.

42
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,870
Zhang Qiming, you haven't changed!

43
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,430
A toad lusting after a swan.

44
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,910
Do I look like a toad?

45
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:31,870
You're talking nonsense.

46
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,750
Aiping, are you okay with this?

47
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,000
If not, just tell me.

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,150
I'll teach him a lesson right now.

49
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,360
What's with that look?

50
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,470
Isn't it obvious?

51
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,150
You two…

52
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,870
I'll leave you to it.

53
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,030
You guys go ahead.

54
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,120
Safe way home.

55
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,870
Okay. I'll see myself out.

56
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,750
Thanks, Xiu'e.

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,840
I'm leaving now.

58
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,800
Goodbye.

59
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,150
Silly woman.

60
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,560
She's speechless now.

61
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,150
Soon enough,

62
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,240
the whole neighborhood will be informed.

63
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,040
It's all your fault.

64
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,450
It's good they know.

65
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,430
We don't have to tell everyone,

66
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,270
right?

67
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,640
How are you feeling?

68
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,310
Any better?

69
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:36,990
Much better.

70
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,150
I've canceled that job for Zhu.

71
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,080
You don't have to work there anymore.

72
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,150
Why are you doing that?

73
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,150
You should've told them in advance.

74
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,470
Why bother telling them early?

75
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,000
I explained our relationship,

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,800
and he was shocked.

77
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,340
He won't dare order you around.

78
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,870
You should think about it from his side.

79
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,030
Qiming,

80
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,280
Han said

81
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,680
you'd better quit smoking

82
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,560
if possible,

83
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:12,680
when you're here,

84
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,280
don't smoke if you can help it.

85
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,630
He said it's bad for your health.

86
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,560
Han said that?

87
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:25,750
Do you remember

88
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,040
you once told me that?

89
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,720
You've

90
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,360
accepted me then.

91
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:31,920
By saying that,

92
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,360
he's accepted me as well?

93
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,390
You figure it out yourself.

94
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,190
Totally got it.

95
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,190
I'll quit smoking.

96
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,390
I quit.

97
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,230
Uh,

98
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,240
let me put on my shoes.

99
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,160
I'll make the chicken soup now.

100
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,430
No need to rush.

101
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,830
I've got to.

102
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,190
Hurry, take this out.

103
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,510
(Welcome new millennium)
No now.

104
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,600
(Inflatable toys, 20)
Hands off.

105
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,480
- So ignorant.
- Hey, you…

106
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,560
- This red one.
- What's taking Xiao Han so long?

107
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,040
He went to pick up Mao Tou.

108
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,240
Mao Tou is coming too?

109
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,870
He's just a kid,

110
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:23,870
he loves the crowd.

111
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:24,830
Yulia!

112
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,960
Mao Tou.

113
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,040
Why are you so late?

114
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,880
Brother Xiao Han.

115
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,040
Sorry, we're late.

116
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,950
What did you just shout?

117
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,630
I… I said you're here.

118
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,360
I mean you're here too.

119
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,190
Of course we're all here today.

120
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,680
Is everything ready?

121
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,680
Alright.

122
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,390
Now we're all here.

123
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,800
I just checked.

124
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,560
The competition is tough.

125
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,040
But fortunately,

126
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,560
we have many people.

127
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,830
Let's split up to sell.

128
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,600
Meet at Dianchi Road before noon.

129
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:01,950
The view there is great,

130
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,240
and we can watch the fireworks

131
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,560
and countdown. Agreed?

132
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,470
- Agreed.
- Good!

133
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,680
- Sure.
- No problem.

134
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,070
I can't run,
so I'll stay here.

135
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,920
You split into three groups.

136
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,600
Qian Jiayue, you're with…

137
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,630
- With me.
- Okay.

138
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,230
With me.

139
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,480
Alright, I'll be with Chen Mo.

140
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,630
Teamwork makes it easier.

141
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,120
Wait, wait, hold on.

142
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,960
What about me?

143
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,070
You promised

144
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,950
we'd be in a group.

145
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,070
Fine, fine.

146
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,360
You two are together.

147
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,430
Seems I'm quite in demand.

148
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,870
Let's go, grab the stuff.

149
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,680
We'll conquer the market
of Shanghai Bund.

150
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:36,560
Hurry up and follow me.

151
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,830
I'll be Xu Wenqiang.

152
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:44,790
Then…

153
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,960
We're in a group?

154
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,270
Alright.

155
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,920
Let's take a bag of stuff.

156
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,760
How about this one?

157
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,470
Let's go.

158
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,800
Let's head this way.

159
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,640
Okay.

160
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,160
- See you later.
- See you.

161
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,190
See you.

162
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,360
I did my best.

163
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,110
Let's go.

164
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,870
- What?
- Let's go.

165
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,160
Let's head there. There're more people.

166
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
You always talk so fast.

167
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,030
Really?

168
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:18,950
I'll talk slower then.

169
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,510
I got the postcard.

170
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,000
The bridge

171
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,070
looks quite nice.

172
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,360
Golden Gate Bridge.

173
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,640
Ah, Shanghai?

174
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,480
Not cold at all.

175
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,230
Don't worry.

176
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,390
Have you contacted Jianjun?

177
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,480
What are you doing?

178
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,830
You scared me!

179
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,600
I wasn't doing anything.

180
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,560
I know what you're up to.

181
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,160
I'm knitting.

182
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,110
Gotcha.

183
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,360
Baby already told you

184
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,830
not to stick that on.

185
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,720
Just quit it.

186
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,160
Why don't you listen?

187
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,480
Quit it.

188
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,630
Sorry, sorry.

189
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,680
Fine, I won't then.

190
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,200
Aiping.

191
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,120
I'm not surprised

192
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,600
by you two.

193
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,550
I knew it from the start.

194
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,550
You're always in front of me,

195
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,910
nothing gets past me,

196
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,040
right?

197
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,980
I think it's great.

198
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,200
When did you guys start?

199
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,620
Tell us about it.

200
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,960
Xiu'e already told you.

201
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,550
Chen Xiu'e is always so loopy,

202
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,080
talking about superstitions

203
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,550
and nonsense.

204
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,550
But when it's something important,
she's all over the place.

205
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,150
We want to hear your side.

206
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,870
Yes, we want your version.

207
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,790
When did you

208
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,670
hold hands?

209
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,750
When did you kiss?

210
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,670
Come on.

211
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,550
Xiu'e, hurry up!

212
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,390
We're waiting for you.

213
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,200
Let's play and chat.

214
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,550
I'm going for a walk.

215
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,600
You guys have fun first.

216
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,670
Where are you going?

217
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,360
Are you okay?

218
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,240
- Outside.
- Why are you heading outside?

219
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,200
Is she feeling unwell?

220
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,270
Is it stuffy in here?

221
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,510
Kill the Bug.

222
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,030
Get good grades.

223
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,040
Finished?

224
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,360
Draw a lot to solidify it.

225
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,150
I want to write a few more.

226
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,240
- Later, I…
- Go ahead.

227
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,630
To Aiping:

228
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,150
Kill the Bug.

229
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,080
Live a happy life.

230
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,480
To Fangfang:

231
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,390
Have a harmonious family.

232
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,480
Pei.

233
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,030
To Pei:

234
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,240
May business thrive.

235
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,320
May business thrive.

236
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,000
Inflatable hammers.

237
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,660
- Inflatable hammers.
- Inflatable hammers.

238
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,750
- Hi.
- Inflatable hammers.

239
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,080
Do you want one? 20 yuan each.

240
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,240
- No
- No, thanks.

241
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,790
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

242
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,120
Loner Xiao, you're excited today.

243
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,440
We're out having fun.

244
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,200
Shouldn't I be happy?

245
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,680
Glad to see.

246
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,150
Last time I saw you,

247
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,670
you were so down.

248
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,020
Maybe because

249
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,480
I know my mom isn't lonely.

250
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,790
Inflatable hammers!

251
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,790
Want an inflatable hammer?

252
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,240
Want an inflatable hammer?

253
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,720
Look at that hammer.

254
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,560
Want one?

255
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,910
How much is it, miss?

256
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,240
- Twenty.
- Too expensive.

257
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,840
Not expensive. It's the holidays.

258
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,480
How about this? Let's swap.

259
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,440
Look.

260
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,200
- Right, look.
- We have so many things.

261
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,040
Pick anything you like.

262
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,480
I want the crown on your head.

263
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,670
No problem.

264
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,120
Thank you.

265
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,510
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

266
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,800
Happy New Year.

267
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,960
- Happy New Year.
- Bye.

268
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,600
Does it look good?

269
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,390
Crowns for sale.

270
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,440
Five yuan each.

271
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,870
- Stop, it's not for sell.
- Five yuan.

272
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,440
I swapped this with the hammer.

273
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,550
Such a rip-off.

274
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:51,670
Calculating every day.

275
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,600
I'm sure it's right.

276
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,600
I was passing by.

277
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,480
Can I use the restroom?

278
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,840
Sure. Go ahead.

279
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,480
Where's Xiu'e?

280
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,750
Wasn't she here for mahjong?

281
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,000
I don't know what got into her.

282
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,150
She suddenly left.

283
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,040
Just left a bit ago.

284
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,960
Have some water.

285
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,870
Thank you.

286
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,240
It's fine. Just relax.

287
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,800
Pei.

288
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,630
Pei?

289
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,800
What's wrong?

290
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,470
This…

291
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,590
Xiu…

292
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,040
Talisman…

293
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,960
Xiu'e…

294
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:44,750
Then…

295
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:45,870
You…

296
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,200
You know what I mean.

297
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,320
Honey, why are you back so early?

298
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,130
I didn't see you inside.

299
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,440
I brought the guest by

300
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,970
and used the restroom at Pei's.

301
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,390
You said you were playing mahjong,

302
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,550
why are you here?

303
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:22,630
Are you okay?

304
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,550
Well...

305
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,360
Nothing serious.

306
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,360
I know they always say

307
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,000
that I'm silly.

308
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,670
I don't actually know

309
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,360
if these talismans really work.

310
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,630
But I think

311
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,720
it's a blessing,

312
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,960
it won't hurt.

313
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,790
You're truly considerate.

314
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,750
They all know you mean well.

315
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,480
You want Aiping to be healthy,
so you get her one.

316
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,670
You hope Pei to have a booming business,
you get her one too.

317
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,200
As for Fangfang,

318
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,200
you wish her family to be harmonious,

319
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,200
so you get one for her.

320
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,840
They all know you wish them good.

321
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,000
As for us,

322
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,150
you must hope…

323
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,390
For us, it's just superstition.

324
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,790
I don't want the computer to break.

325
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,550
You hope the computer doesn't break

326
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,870
also because

327
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,360
you don't want
my hard-earned money wasted.

328
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,440
You did it for me.

329
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,870
Honey, you're so good at this.

330
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,630
Mom tore this off?

331
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,360
She threw it in Baby's trash.

332
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,670
I picked it up.

333
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,200
Wait here.

334
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,270
I'll find a way to fix it.

335
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:47,990
Honey,

336
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,200
come back. You go drive.

337
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,040
Come on.

338
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,440
I…

339
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,320
I'll make sure the computer's safe,
then I'll drive.

340
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,390
You're still at work. Come back.

341
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,080
I can handle this myself.

342
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:02,960
Hurry up and get going!

343
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,750
I'll go get more orders.

344
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:06,360
Are you really okay?

345
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,030
They're waiting for you to play mahjong.

346
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,510
Go to them.

347
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,800
Honey,

348
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,390
drive safe.

349
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,800
Alright.

350
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,840
I'm leaving, okay.

351
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,030
Is she upset?

352
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,630
Absolutely.

353
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,960
Didn't expect her
to write blessings for us.

354
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,800
Exactly.

355
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,800
Here she comes.

356
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,030
Xiu'e, you're back!

357
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,960
Liu Songming

358
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,600
is totally unreliable.

359
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,750
The talisman he pasted

360
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,200
is so flimsy.

361
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,840
It fell off and got dirty.

362
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,750
Exactly.

363
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,630
It's really frustrating.

364
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:57,710
Yeah.

365
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,480
Make some space for me.

366
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,480
Pei,

367
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,030
I've got to say,

368
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,200
the talisman Xiu'e gave me

369
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,480
was really effective.

370
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,750
Once I stuck it on,

371
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,790
I immediately felt better.

372
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,760
So effective.

373
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,830
Since I put it on,

374
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,550
Chen hasn't yelled at me once.

375
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,480
See how effective the talisman is.

376
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,350
It really works.

377
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:28,350
If mine gets dirty,

378
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,680
will it still work?

379
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,590
It'll work.

380
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,240
Really?

381
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,790
My dear Chen Xiu'e,

382
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,000
do you have a new one for me?

383
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,200
I want one too.

384
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,750
I do have one.

385
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,680
But I've written on it,
you can't use it anymore.

386
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,160
Who is this?

387
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,480
What did I say?

388
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,440
Speak of the devil.

389
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,600
What?

390
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,550
Who is this?

391
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,480
Zhang Qiming, right?

392
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,270
Are you here to eat,

393
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,550
or to find someone?

394
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,240
To pick up Aiping.

395
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,160
Isn't that obvious?

396
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,440
To pick up Aiping.

397
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,310
Pick up Aiping!

398
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,590
Wait.

399
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,480
Well,

400
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,640
why not pick up Fangfang,

401
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,350
Xiu'e or Pei,

402
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:19,200
- but only Aiping?
- Right.

403
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,880
Yeah, explain yourself.

404
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,520
You guys are so annoying.

405
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:23,440
The doctor said

406
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,750
she's still not fully recovered,

407
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,560
and needs more rest.

408
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,590
Feel for her?

409
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,590
Have you heard?

410
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,750
The bond between you and the person

411
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,510
you spend New Year's Eve with
or first speak with

412
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,840
in the new millennium

413
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,160
could last a century.

414
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,960
How could I miss this chance,

415
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,800
right?

416
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,550
Aiping, I made some pigeon soup,

417
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,510
and rented your favorite movie.

418
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,550
Let's watch it with the soup

419
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,110
and wait for Han and Mao Tou.

420
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,550
I have nothing to say.

421
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,110
I got goosebumps!

422
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,790
Goosebumps all over.

423
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,110
Aiping, you're leaving?

424
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,200
Just like that?

425
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,750
- Woman, get yourself under control.
- Madam, the A/C is open.

426
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,790
Aiping.

427
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:04,990
We're missing one for the game!

428
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,400
It's a bit cold outside.

429
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,480
Put your coat on.

430
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:10,960
Some imp dropped this,

431
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,480
might come looking for it.

432
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,790
The pigeon soup's really nourishing.

433
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,750
Can you handle it?

434
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,960
You're really leaving, Aiping?

435
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,040
Yes, I'm leaving.

436
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,810
- Bye.
- Happy New Year!

437
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,830
A bunch of evil women.

438
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:27,070
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

439
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,280
Okay, fine.

440
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,240
I just got back,

441
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,550
we're missing one again.

442
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,750
Hammer for twenty.

443
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,270
Sis, want a hammer?

444
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,400
I've also got axes.

445
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:40,790
Sticks, sticks.

446
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,400
Sticks and hammers.

447
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,750
It's almost midnight.

448
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,880
Let's head back and meet up.

449
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,800
Almost sold out.

450
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,010
Let's finish these first.

451
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,040
Put this on.

452
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,200
I'm not cold.

453
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,400
(Jiale Wontons)
No "bad luck" on New Year's.

454
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,880
Puh, puh!

455
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,310
May we all

456
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,570
- have good luck.
- Have great fortune.

457
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,270
Get rich.

458
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:09,830
- Who's that?
- It's…

459
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,310
Chen?

460
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,480
- You back early.
- Hello, Mr. Chen.

461
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,640
Weren't you returning tomorrow?

462
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,350
The meeting ended early.

463
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,680
How did you know I'm here?

464
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,310
You left a note for Momo.

465
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:28,910
Oh, I remember.

466
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,510
We already…

467
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:33,680
No, no.

468
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,550
Go home.

469
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,720
He's been driving a long way.

470
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,560
Specially to pick you up.

471
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,350
Yes, hurry back.

472
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,830
I feel bad though.

473
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,510
It's fine. Don't feel bad.

474
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,750
Happy New Year.

475
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:44,960
No, no, no.

476
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,750
Happy New Century!

477
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,440
Happy New Century!

478
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,310
I'm leaving now.

479
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,200
See you next century.

480
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,030
See you next century.

481
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,270
We're missing two now.

482
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,270
What's left to play now?

483
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,440
What's left to play?

484
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,350
Look,

485
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,640
it's so fun.

486
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:13,680
Give me the crown.

487
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,200
Why? I won't sell it for five.

488
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,520
Give me the crown.

489
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,840
Here you go.

490
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,040
Wait for me.

491
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,000
Happy New Year, sir!

492
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:27,890
Happy New Year.

493
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,400
Can I have two sparklers?

494
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,450
I'll trade them with this.

495
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,350
Alright, but only two.

496
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,270
Thanks.

497
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,480
Two sticks.

498
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,680
Can you light it for me?

499
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,790
Sure.

500
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,030
- Thanks!
- Happy New Year.

501
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:46,910
Here you go.

502
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,520
Light it up.

503
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:50,910
Be careful.

504
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,000
Okay, okay.

505
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,960
Guess what I wrote.

506
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,240
How could I guess that?

507
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,070
Happy New Year.

508
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,960
I'll write one for you.

509
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,590
What is it?

510
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,080
I know.

511
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,240
Really?

512
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,030
Crown for five.

513
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,100
There's no crown.

514
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:29,010
- There's no crown.
- No crown.

515
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,590
Give me my crown back.

516
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,750
The Queen. Ranking higher.

517
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:36,670
Come on.

518
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,440
This game is getting boring.

519
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,680
I'm done, you win.

520
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,790
You win, okay?

521
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:45,160
Come on.

522
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,080
Pei,

523
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,790
what time is it now?

524
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,270
I'll check.

525
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,510
It's 11:30 PM.

526
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,400
When's Liu Dagui

527
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,200
showing up on TV?

528
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:02,790
Should be soon.

529
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:05,350
He said it's around midnight.

530
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:08,270
I remember in my 20 years old,

531
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,960
I could stay up all night.

532
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,440
Now, I just

533
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:16,010
want to

534
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:20,880
soak my feet in hot water.

535
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,550
Who said

536
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,880
she'd stay up with me for New Year's?

537
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,350
Are you abandoning me?

538
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,590
I'm up!

539
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,270
Are you abandoning me?

540
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,720
It's just you two?

541
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,880
Honey.

542
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,750
Qian Kang.

543
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,270
Why are you back so early?

544
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,400
Didn't you say

545
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,240
you'd be back later?

546
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,880
There are quite a few customers.

547
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,440
Everyone's rushing home.

548
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,590
The radio's only playing songs of reunion

549
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,750
and homeward journey.

550
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,070
I can't resist but come back.

551
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,140
Earnings don't really matter.

552
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,240
It's the new millennium.

553
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,200
It's better to be home.

554
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,200
Playing cards?

555
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,920
What's the game? I'll join you.

556
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,350
High cards. Let's play together.

557
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,400
- Come on.
- Sure.

558
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,480
Xiu'e, what's wrong?

559
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:09,630
Nothing.

560
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,510
I just suddenly remembered

561
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,270
mom is home alone.

562
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,750
Not sure if she's asleep yet.

563
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,160
- Let's play.
- Come on.

564
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,590
What's wrong, Pei? Tired?

565
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:31,640
Xiu'e, you're right.

566
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,640
We can't fight age.

567
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,030
I suddenly want to go soak my feet.

568
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,240
You are not faking it, are you?

569
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,590
How can I fake tiredness?

570
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,550
I'm really tired.

571
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,350
Well,

572
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,790
my sleepiness hits so quickly.

573
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,720
Why don't you head back?

574
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,790
Don't delay my foot soak.

575
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,790
I'm really leaving now.

576
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,880
Go, go.

577
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,960
I need to heat the water.

578
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,160
Alright, we're leaving.

579
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,750
Go on, head back now.

580
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,350
Pei,

581
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,040
thank you.

582
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,000
Silly, no need to thank me.

583
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,030
Pei.

584
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,350
It's cold outside.

585
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,830
Happy New Year.

586
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,200
Happy New Year.

587
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,200
Alright, we're leaving.

588
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,880
- Go on.
- Let's go.

589
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,830
- This one's big.
- Really big.

590
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,680
This is good.

591
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,550
You should take the bigger one.

592
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:53,640
Imagine how impressive
the big one looks, right?

593
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,750
Other colors…

594
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,590
Yellow.

595
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,160
We have blue ones too.

596
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,480
Why aren't they back yet?

597
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,160
It's running late.

598
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,310
It's almost midnight now.

599
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,200
Ka Men, look over there.

600
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,550
The TV station's interviewing.

601
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,160
Do you think they might

602
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,790
come interview us?

603
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,110
In your dream.

604
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,720
How so?

605
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:15,670
Thanks.

606
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,400
Is that…

607
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,550
Lu Yao from Sunny Club?

608
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,480
It's so crowded.

609
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,600
The countdown will start soon.

610
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,960
We can't make it.

611
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,200
What should we do?

612
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,880
I just want to see

613
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,590
if I can record your performance.

614
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,590
- Shining stars…
- Great.

615
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,230
- light up both banks.
- Haven't started.

616
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,480
Tonight, the Bund is a sea of joy.

617
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,830
The lucky viewer

618
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:00,000
is standing next to me now.

619
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,960
Let's hear her New Year's wishes.

620
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,240
She looks like Qing.

621
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,640
The camera's this way.

622
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:10,510
Hello everyone, I'm Liu Wanqing,

623
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,430
a Grade 10 student
at No. 2 Middle School.

624
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,510
- I'm here with my…
- Qing!

625
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,720
classmates today.

626
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,830
It really is Qing!

627
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,160
(Live from the Bund,
2000 New Year's Eve Gala)

628
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,550
They are my classmates.

629
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,350
I want to tell my friends

630
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,270
we'll be friends for life.

631
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,750
We have a century of destiny.

632
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,160
We are lifelong...

633
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,400
You're my daughter for life.

634
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,200
Let's thank Liu…

635
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,350
And to my idols Jeff Chang,

636
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,780
Tony Leung Chiu-wai
and Takeshi Kaneshiro:

637
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,680
I will always love you.

638
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,750
Always.

639
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,070
Mom will always love you.

640
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,820
Always.

641
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,730
Qing is on TV!

642
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,350
She's on TV!

643
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:51,980
(Jiale Wontons)
My Qing is on TV!

644
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,550
The countdown's starting!

645
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,840
Ten,

646
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,840
nine,

647
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,830
eight,

648
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:11,880
seven,

649
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:12,910
six,

650
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:13,950
five,

651
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:14,950
four,

652
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:15,870
three,

653
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,810
two,

654
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,760
one.

655
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:20,720
Happy New Year!

656
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,640
Such huge fireworks!

657
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,590
Happy New Year!

658
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,030
Honey, Happy New Century!

659
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:36,350
Happy New Century to you too!

660
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,790
Mom, Happy New Year!

661
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,720
It's twelve o'clock.

662
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,350
Momo should be back soon.

663
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,000
She should be back soon.

664
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,590
I told her to take a cab.

665
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,960
I think

666
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,000
we shouldn't have

667
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,440
let her go out for New Year's Eve.

668
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,240
Alright, alright.

669
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,790
It's the new millennium.

670
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,160
Happy New Year!

671
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,550
Happy New Year!

672
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,680
Let me serve you some more.

673
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,880
Thank you.

674
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,320
Aiping,

675
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,070
Happy New Year!

676
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,030
I promise we won't part in this century.

677
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,550
You're so cheesy

678
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:28,680
for your age.

679
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,000
Aren't you gonna say

680
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,070
'Happy New Year' to me?

681
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,070
Happy New Year!

682
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,350
Happy New Year!

683
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,240
Why are you serving the soup?

684
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,080
I'll do it.

685
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,200
Be careful.

686
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,040
I got it.

687
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,350
Look at

688
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,350
your bowl.

689
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,190
You…

690
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,590
You didn't even touch it.

691
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:01,750
Happy New Year.

692
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,000
Happy New Year, Chen Mo.

693
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:08,870
Look.

694
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,550
Qian Jiayue.

695
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,440
Qian Jiayue.

696
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:18,830
Happy New Year.

697
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,350
Can't hear you.

698
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,000
You too.

699
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,030
I'll go find them.

700
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,830
Excuse me.

701
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:39,030
Did my blessing reach my idols?

702
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,190
Maybe it'll air.

703
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,170
See the replay tomorrow.

704
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,750
You're Lu Yao, right?

705
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,520
Happy New Year!

706
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,640
Happy New Year!

707
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,880
Happy New Year!

708
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,830
Oh my!

709
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,720
I really met Lu Yao!

710
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,940
Who is Lu Yao?

711
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:59,070
Wow, my first words in the new century
were with him.

712
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:01,480
I'm so lucky.

713
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,980
(Date and Time)

714
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,550
It's been two minutes already.

715
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,960
I knew there's no millennium bug.

716
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,480
I won.

717
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,070
Lucky day today.

718
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,350
Dad, Mom.

719
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,590
- Can you keep it down?
- Sure, sure.

720
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,680
Playing mahjong every day.

721
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,240
Other kids are out celebrating.

722
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,400
Why are you staying home?

723
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,640
Right. Don't mind me.

724
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,240
- Get me some water.
- Mom's on fire today.

725
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,030
Aren't you happy for her?

726
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,240
I was telling you

727
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,640
that I just got the tile

728
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,830
I needed.

729
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,200
Before the competition starts,

730
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,350
I'd like to introduce

731
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,990
- our prize for the year's champion.
- Big prize?

732
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:41,830
Yes.

733
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:44,550
An apartment of two bedrooms
and a living room at Ruihong Xincheng.

734
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:47,070
An apartment of two bedrooms
and a living room.

735
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:49,720
Ruihong Xincheng? It's too remote.

736
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,830
Exactly.

737
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,680
It's better

738
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,640
to give 20,000 cash.

739
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,620
Counting cash like this

740
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,310
in the New Year is unbelievable.

741
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,920
Come on, shuffle the tiles.

742
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,440
Nothing is more exciting

743
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,280
than counting cash.

744
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,960
I wonder where Ka Men and the others went.

745
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,610
Did they go home?

746
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,690
I didn't expect so many people
on New Year's Eve.

747
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,960
Today, I truly understand

748
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,240
what

749
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,720
"packed like sardines"

750
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,920
and "huge crowds" mean.

751
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,200
It's "people mountain people sea".

752
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,160
Everyone's struggling to get a cab.

753
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,270
Are we really gonna walk

754
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,480
back to Putuo?

755
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,680
Walking's not bad either.

756
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,750
Not bad?

757
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,000
Isn't it good?

758
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,750
No, it's exhausting.

759
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,000
Hold on.

760
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,960
Happy New Year, sir.

761
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,800
Happy New Year.

762
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,790
- Can I have these?
- Sure.

763
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,400
- Thanks.
- Take them.

764
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:11,870
What are you doing?

765
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,200
Distract yourself.

766
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,430
How does that work?

767
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,190
Can you make paper planes?

768
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,320
- Of course.
- You make one.

769
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,430
Let's compete,

770
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:25,400
see whose flies further.

771
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,440
Then you're bound to lose.

772
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,920
I've made more paper planes

773
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,960
than tests you've completed.

774
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,390
We'll see about that.

775
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,400
Making it fast doesn't mean it'll fly far.

776
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,720
Done.

777
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,390
Here we go.

778
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:45,910
Ready.

779
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,680
Three, two…

780
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,520
Wait a second!

781
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,320
One!

782
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,640
You're jumping the gun.

783
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,070
I won!

784
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,560
(Puyang New Village)
I beat an all-A student!

785
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,960
That's unfair.

786
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,750
You stepped on my plane.

787
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,960
Whatever, I still win.

788
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,150
Fine, you win.

789
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,880
Then give me this as prize.

790
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,030
You're home.

791
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,630
Let me walk you back.

792
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,190
No need.

793
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:37,670
It's just cross the street.

794
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:41,910
Bye.

795
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:42,910
Take care.

796
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,600
Chen Mo.

797
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,710
Final exams are coming up.

798
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,190
So?

799
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,590
If you need help, just ask me.

800
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,590
I don't need another person
breathing down my neck.

801
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,200
Bye.

802
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,720
See you.

803
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,670
Go home.

804
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
You go first.

805
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,550
No way.

806
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,360
Things are moving fast.

807
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,550
The end is really coming.

808
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,620
(Jinxiu Garden)

809
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,320
Is your birthday coming up?

810
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,670
January 16th. Why?

811
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,280
Are you getting me a gift?

812
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,200
Sure.

813
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,120
I'll get you something.

814
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,590
You'll definitely love it.

815
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,390
Alright.

816
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,280
Deal.

817
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,240
Deal.

818
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:07,340
(Puyang New Village)

819
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,800
- Wang Bin, Liu Jianfeng, Chang Wuji,
- Thanks.

820
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,480
Mao Tou, Xiao Han,

821
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,670
plus the three of us, that's eight people.

822
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,760
Is it enough?

823
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,880
- Enough.
- Okay.

824
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,640
Boss, how much?

825
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,190
Forty-seven yuan and sixty cents.

826
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,630
Here, fifty yuan.

827
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,470
Okay.

828
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,430
Here's your charge.

829
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,320
Thanks.

830
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,840
Come again!

831
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,640
Let me help you.

832
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,200
Chen Mo,

833
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,800
there's something
that's been bothering me.

834
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,280
I'm not sure what to do.

835
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,720
What's going on?

836
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,670
Two good friends of mine…

837
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,440
Good friends?

838
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,760
My middle school friends.

839
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,800
You don't know them.

840
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:51,550
Both of them like the same guy.

841
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,400
So dramatic.

842
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,280
Yes.

843
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,800
One has liked him for a long time,

844
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:04,360
and the other just recently.

845
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,800
And this guy

846
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,190
seems to like the latter.

847
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,480
I'm caught in the middle, feeling torn.

848
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,800
Ka Men,

849
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,230
don't get yourself involved.

850
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,190
You don't want to end up

851
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,480
being out in the cold.

852
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,360
Let them handle it themselves.

853
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,550
Alright, stop overthinking it.

854
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,710
Let's play cards. Let's go.

855
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,280
Be quiet.

856
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,190
Jump, jump.

857
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,360
- Can't do that.
- No way.

858
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,640
Mr. Chen.

859
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,860
- Mr. Chen.
- Dad.

860
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,700
Mr…

861
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,590
- Mr. Chen.
- Hello, Mr. Chen.

862
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,840
Hello, Mr. Chen.

863
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,440
Dad, you…

864
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:02,590
Weren't you working late?

865
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,110
Final exams are coming soon.

866
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,590
Aren't you guys studying?

867
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:13,280
We are. These are the elites from our school.

868
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,880
I invited them over

869
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,800
to

870
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,710
study later.

871
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:21,320
This is Liu Wanqing.

872
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,070
She excels in English.

873
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,810
Nice to meet you.

874
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,190
This is Qian Jiayue.

875
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,190
You knew her.

876
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,550
Her article was published in Wenhui Daily.

877
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,720
She's good at Chinese.

878
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,440
She just became a reporter
for school journal.

879
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:35,760
Yes, Mr. Chen.

880
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:37,310
This is my article.

881
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,580
(Author: Qian Jiayue)

882
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,800
Article.

883
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,840
Mr. Chen,

884
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,680
this one

885
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,070
is Brother Xiao Han.

886
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,800
He is the best among us.

887
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,630
Top three in the grade.

888
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,960
President of Student Union.

889
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,920
A soulless study machine.

890
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,070
Hello, Mr. Chen.

891
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:58,550
I'm Liu Jianfeng, an athlete.

892
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,360
I'm great at sports. Hello, Uncle Chen.

893
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,000
Uncle Chen.

894
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,590
Hi, Uncle Chen. I'm Mao Tou.

895
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,480
I'm her little brother.

896
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,800
I'm here

897
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,000
to learn from these amazing seniors.

898
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,360
Just focus on studying,

899
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,670
don't create these distractions.

900
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,480
Playing cards and watching TV.

901
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,230
Well, we're all learning from him,

902
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,280
Chang Wuji.

903
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:26,190
He's the top
in the Olympiad Math Team.

904
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,280
He taught us strategies for card games

905
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,550
and how to remember things fast.

906
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,280
The show is starting!

907
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,800
Chang Wuji!

908
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,030
Dad, look.

909
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,440
That's the host.

910
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:39,480
So beautiful.

911
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,480
Absolutely.

912
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,760
Look, it's Chang Wuji.

913
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,880
Chang Wuji looks different like on TV,

914
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,720
right?

915
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,510
Be quiet. It's starting.

916
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:54,370
Hello, everyone!

917
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:57,000
Welcome to the new episode
of Digital Challenge Arena.

918
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,320
Today,

919
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,480
there are four challengers.

920
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,710
Look, Liu Songming

921
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,190
is dancing again.

922
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:03,360
Comrades.

923
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,070
- Friends.
- Xiu'e.

924
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,310
- One for each.
- What?

925
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,360
What is it?

926
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,840
Gui.

927
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,080
- Striving?.
- Aiping.

928
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:14,030
What's it about?

929
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,550
The journal of No. 2 Middle School.

930
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,480
Open to the first page.

931
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,630
Look for three familiar words.

932
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:22,960
No. 2 Middle School.

933
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,150
Qian Jiayue!

934
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,600
Where is it?

935
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:30,450
Right here.

936
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,340
(Qian Jiayue)
Where?

937
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:33,590
It's really Jiayue!

938
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:34,480
Impressive.

939
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,440
Right here.

940
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:39,150
Jiayue's article is in the school journal.

941
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,800
She's now a reporter.

942
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:41,800
She's a celebrity.

943
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,960
Do you know any celebrities?

944
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,320
We're about to start

945
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:47,550
the battle for the annual championship.

946
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:49,440
The competition's heating up!

947
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:52,150
Today, the weekly champion…

948
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,120
Look.

949
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,670
This is Qing's

950
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:56,960
classmate.

951
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,910
(Chang Wuji, Student)
Our challenger Chang Wuji

952
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:00,760
has removed all obstacles.

953
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,320
- Chang…
- Chang Wuji.

954
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,880
Looks a bit familiar.

955
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:07,190
Who will make it to the end?

956
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:10,230
Let's move on to the final showdown.

957
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:13,150
Ready? Three, two, one.
Here's the question.

958
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,120
Stop.

959
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,230
That's so fast!

960
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,310
I can't even see it clearly.

961
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,510
Who can remember all that?

962
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,070
This is really tough.

963
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:23,510
It requests instant memory.

964
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,800
Let's see their answers.

965
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:27,360
Please show your answer board.

966
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:34,800
Aren't both answers the same?

967
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:35,890
No, they're different.

968
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:38,380
Look at the last two numbers.

969
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:39,670
One is 03,

970
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,190
and the other is 30.

971
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:43,150
Yes, the last two are different.

972
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,000
How did you notice so fast?

973
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,150
I couldn't even read it.

974
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,070
I'm the bookkeeper here.

975
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,630
One of them is correct

976
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,480
and the other only missed by two numbers.

977
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,400
So close.

978
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,630
Who will be the champion

979
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:02,070
and who will have to leave?

980
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:03,590
Stop keeping us in suspense.

981
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:05,590
I'll throw the remote in your face.

982
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,550
Congratulations, Chang Wuji wins!

983
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:11,150
Chang Wuji is today's champion.

984
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:13,360
He won! He won!

985
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,070
What happened?

986
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:16,440
Who won?

987
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,880
Chang Wuji.
