The moonlight pond is a sacred place.

11
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,910
Whenever the water turns blue.

12
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,760
Both worlds will be intertwined.

13
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,700
Deceased ones will be resurrected.

14
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,240
Phupha Phupha!!

15
00:01:22,289 --> 00:01:24,810
Help…help. Anybody help!

16
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:31,830
And the ones alive will disappear into some other world.

17
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,690
This’s my locket.

18
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,970
I give it to you.

19
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:18,560
Boo!

20
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:23,710
Shit! You scared the shit out of me! Thought I saw a ghost.

21
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,470
I should be an angel.

22
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:33,120
I’ve not seen you for over 2 weeks. Been missing me?

23
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:38,370
Of course! But what can I do. I don’t wanna upset your grandma.

24
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,610
Yeah…. she goes on and on about it all the time.

25
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:47,010
The closer we are to the Ash Exchange Ceremony, the risky it is for us to meet.

26
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,790
No to this….no to that.

27
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,050
But I’ve missed you!! So, I had to come.

28
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,440
Happy to see me?

29
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,620
Sure…

30
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:17,010
Kram….Kram….Kram!

31
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,370
I came all the way here to see you.

32
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,340
Oh…where is she now?

33
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,680
Dad, I’m back!

34
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,280
One second.

35
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,350
Wow!!!

36
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,560
I’m coming.

37
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:48,610
Fish porridge again!! Thought you said you’d get something nicer.

38
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,220
I’m sorry Kram,

39
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,820
didn’t sell any of the paintings today.

40
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,260
Guess I’m no talent.

41
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,500
They don’t appreciate my work any more.

42
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,600
I think they’re great! Maybe people just don’t get it.

43
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,010
Why don’t you ask them what they like?

44
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:18,480
Well, some of the might. My friends tell me all those rich people like having themselves painted

45
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,350
and put the portraits up to decorate their house.

46
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:26,100
Why don’t you pose for me.

47
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:29,600
I think you’d be good at it.

48
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,150
Nah. Not into it.

49
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,210
It’s so easy and it won’t take long. Just sit. I’ll draw. It’ll be perfect.

50
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:39,210
Nah. I’m too embarrassed.

51
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:42,110
OK…OK you eat first. Enjoy!

52
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,730
Hey! Who’s that over there?

53
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,320
Hey…wait….no no I’m not…

54
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,720
You pervert!!

55
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,070
Help me, dad. Help me!!!

56
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:23,040
Dad!! We’re getting robbed!!

57
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,740
Wait, Kram!! He’s not a thief.

58
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,010
Then who’s this guy?

59
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,480
This is Phupha, son of uncle Adisak.

60
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,040
You’ve met when you were young, remember?

61
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:39,409
Huh?? That little brat???

62
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,350
Yup.

63
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,810
Sorry about this. We have a lot of robbery around here.

64
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:02,160
You should have stopped and think for a bit. What kind of thief would come naked.

65
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:06,830
And what kind of sane people come in naked into someone. else’s home naked?!?

66
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,550
Don’t worry kids, it was my fault spilling tea onto him.

67
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,500
So, he had to wash up in the bathroom.

68
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:19,990
Yeah…you guys should make friends. Phupha will be with us for a while.

69
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,990
Who would stay with him?

70
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:28,080
Why me…. wait! You said he’ll be living with us for a while?

71
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:32,070
Yes. Phupha is recovering

72
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:36,370
so uncle Adisak would like him to stay with us It’s only gonna be temporary.

73
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,520
We’re not a hotel. Maybe he can go somewhere else.

74
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:45,280
He can’t be anywhere else.

75
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:50,300
Phupha is about to take on my role at work.

76
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:56,030
And if the Big Slum gang finds out, they might attack him.

77
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,610
That’s why I need to leave him here with you guys.

78
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,040
You’ve saved me a lot of times.

79
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,040
It’s time I do something to return your favor.

80
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:12,340
Don’t worry. I’ll take the best care of him.

81
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,920
Kram, why don’t you take Phupha out for a walk.

82
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,140
Go go.

83
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,630
Hey…

84
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,590
The village is over that way.

85
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,920
And there’s a river on the left.

86
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,890
Any other question?

87
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,260
I didn’t ask in the beginning.

88
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:06,380
I’ve not seen you for ages. How’s life been, Richie rich?

89
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,470
Can you not call me that?

90
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,470
You’ve always acted that way.

91
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,370
So, I think you’re one.

92
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,080
Have you forgotten all about it?

93
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,970
I don’t remember anything.

94
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,970
Let me remind you again.

95
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,640
Richie rich.

96
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,850
Richie rich.

97
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,230
Richie rich.

98
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,420
Richie rich.

99
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,799
I bought you this from Rattha. Stuff it in and shut up!

100
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,799
How long do I have to put up with you.

101
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,530
Where are you going, Kram? Where’s Phupa?

102
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:00,270
Dunno. I’ll be out drawing for a while.

103
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:21,770
Hey…you

104
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,750
Hey!!!

105
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,050
What the fuck you think you’re doing.

106
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,870
It’s about to rain. Just thought I’d warn you.

107
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,010
Don’t you ever do this again!!

108
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,180
Why are you throwing this away?

109
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,640
I drew Tai, son of Por, by mistake.

110
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:50,900
Tai? Son of Por. Head of the Big Slum gang?

111
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,420
Yes. But I didn’t realize it was him.

112
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:02,690
It looks good though. Didn’t know you were this good.

113
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:05,620
Thanks.

114
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:11,060
Are you feeling alright? Normally we hardly talk.

115
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,040
I’m just into art.

116
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,480
Wanna buy this piece? I’ll do discount.

117
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,180
Nah.

118
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,940
But I want to hire you to draw me.

119
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,850
Interested?

120
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:54,400
What made you want to go all the way to Moon Shadow waterfall? It’s all the way over there!

121
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,410
Well, once in a lifetime, I should be there

122
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:03,280
Hey. They’re picking on Samorn again.

123
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,340
Samorn?

124
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:14,320
He’s a rabbit. I saved him once.

125
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,130
Oh…

126
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,320
Something wrong?

127
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,280
Nah. Nothing.

128
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:40,540
You’re still into animals like you used to.

129
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,060
And you said you don’t recall much.

130
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,180
Umm…

131
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:48,600
Why did you have to lie?

132
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,280
I just don’t want to get too close to anyone.

133
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:58,240
I’ve learned to keep a distance to be stabbed in the back.

134
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,730
That’s just the life I’ve lived.

135
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,110
What’s with the hug?

136
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,880
Dad teaches me to be kind.

137
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:23,410
To console a friend when he’s in need.

138
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:28,910
It must have hurt you a lot.

139
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:36,540
It’s alright. You can be yourself here.

140
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:48,340
Let’s go. We should get there before it gets dark.

141
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:55,620
So what kind of portrait do you like.

142
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:56,870
Naked.

143
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,560
What?? Like…

144
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,560
Hang on.

145
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,010
What?

146
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:17,099
I don’t think that’s a good idea.

147
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,560
Art is subjective.

148
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,329
Our beautiful bodies are great art.

149
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:30,580
I want to treasure this moment when my body is still in good shape.

150
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,840
Hmmm.

151
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,640
Sit still, would you?

152
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:05,670
Lots of mosquitoes around here. Can you rub some repellent on me?

153
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:10,270
I charge twice as much.

154
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:50,330
Have you heard the myth of Moon Shadow waterfall?

155
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:57,600
I heard if the water turns blue,

156
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,430
you’ll get to meet the deceased ones.

157
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,540
Only kids believe in old tales.

158
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:09,540
How do you know for real?

159
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,570
I came here everyday

160
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:20,290
after mum died.

161
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,100
Isn’t that a proof already?

162
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,550
Sorry about your mum.

163
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:34,820
That’s alright.

164
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,180
My mum died when I was young too.

165
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:47,870
I would have done the same.

166
00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:00,190
I cried day after day at the fall,

167
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:05,010
hoping water would turn blue.

168
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,010
That day never came..

169
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,690
What are you doing?

170
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:29,210
“You console a friend when they’re sad” you’ve told me that.

171
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,020
I’m just doing the same thing.

172
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,720
I’m over it now. Let’s put on some more.

173
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:07,660
Still awake?

174
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:10,870
Yah.

175
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:26,340
I don’t know what it is between you and me.

176
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,730
But I am most myself when I’m with you.

177
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,200
Me too.

178
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:51,810
Let’s spend more time getting to know each other, shall we?

179
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:13,220
Hmmm.

180
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,580
What do you do?

181
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:35,690
Good thing I built a shelter here.

182
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,820
It’s surreal.

183
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:48,100
I can almost leave everything behind just to be with you.

184
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:54,710
You can’t do that. You’ll have to go back to work one day.

185
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,400
Would you like to come with me?

186
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:04,020
I can…but you can’t leave me!!

187
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:21,790
Take this…as my promise.

188
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:26,010
It’s my birth date locket. You can have it.

189
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,540
Are you sure?

190
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,130
Thank you.

191
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,450
But I’m not just giving it to you.

192
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:04,610
This is in exchange for a big hug.

193
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:08,730
It tickles!

194
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:15,680
What are you doing?

195
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,360
Should we….umm….today?

196
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,750
But I’ve never…..

197
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:27,300
It’ll be the first time for both of us.

198
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:39,570
Phupha.

199
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,990
Did you bring…the thing?

200
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:50,450
I didn’t. Is that alright?

201
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,860
I'm okay.

202
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,220
Should we freshen up first?

203
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:20,680
Do we have to?

204
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:29,090
I think we should freshen up first?

205
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:39,880
I think so. Let me go first.

206
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,090
Hmm.

207
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,600
Is everything ok?

208
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:15,580
How do you do it? I’ve never done it before.

209
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:24,860
Don’t laugh. I really don’t know how.

210
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,030
Let’s just leave it.

211
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:31,110
We can do it some other time.

212
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,490
Having you in my arms is more than enough now.

213
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:15,950
Kram!

214
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,520
Duandao!

215
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:30,510
I want to call off our Ash Exchange Ceremony.

216
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,880
Why?

217
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,610
I know you’re in love with Phupha.

218
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:53,590
I’ve always known I can only be a friend.

219
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,770
But I’ve let myself on.

220
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,690
I thought if we could be together,

221
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:11,800
You could be in love with me one day.

222
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:20,720
I went to your shelter last night.

223
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:33,370
I’m….. I’m sorry.

224
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,350
It’s alright. I get it

225
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,130
and I’m happy for you…

226
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:47,210
that you’ve finally found the one

227
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:59,030
I’ve gotta go now. Grandma’s looking for me.

228
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:01,970
Bye.

229
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:37,050
Ouch!! Yes!!....Tai!

230
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:46,170
What the fuck are you looking at. Carry on!

231
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:53,910
We got them, sir!

232
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:57,010
Tai, Por would like to see you.

233
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:58,760
What’s it about?

234
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,760
I believe it’s to do with Phupha.

235
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,850
Whoaa.. a lot has changed around here.

236
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,679
Where are you taking me today?

237
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:21,940
You’ll know. Let’s go.

238
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:38,250
Wow. A gallery??

239
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:42,000
Rent must be super expensive.

240
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:46,199
Who said we had to pay.

241
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:51,500
Don’t tell me….

242
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,400
I run a real estate company.

243
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:59,120
This is one of the buildings we own.

244
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:02,800
So they asked me to be here today for an opening ceremony.

245
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,820
You stay right here. I’ll go get change.

246
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,240
OK.

247
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:23,250
“Ars longa, vita brevis”

248
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,410
– one of the reasons I bought this place

249
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,400
So art can be accessible.

250
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:36,680
One day when I’m long gone, art remains for.

251
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:40,590
our next generation to endure.

252
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:07,700
Hi you.

253
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:36,980
Hey sis! Didn’t know you were into art too.

254
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,340
What’s up?

255
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,890
Fuck art!

256
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:41,820
Jao!

257
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,720
You don’t give up easily, do you?

258
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,020
I’m sorry.

259
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:11,080
Thank God you’re safe. I was appalled!

260
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:16,530
If he comes back again, I might have to hire a bodyguard

261
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,940
Let’s not overreact.

262
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,470
I think he knows it’s wrong.

263
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:28,020
Are you ok, my dear?

264
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,210
I’m alright.

265
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:33,940
No wonder why he’s so spoiled.

266
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:39,100
I think we might have to delay promoting you up.

267
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,080
Let’s wait until we can settle this.

268
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:47,940
Not a bad idea. Why don’t we send him abroad for a while.

269
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:48,940
What do you think, Phupha?

270
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,530
I’ll stay right here.

271
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:58,660
(to dad) You taught me yourself not to give.

272
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,750
I’ll stay and I’ll fight them.

273
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,840
They need to know we’re not cowards.

274
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:23,740
Though you’re not working at Khumfah anymore,

275
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:31,140
but I know there’s something fishy going on.

276
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,490
Like what?

277
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:37,760
Someone is unhappy you’re taking on the position.

278
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:42,900
But this is his dad’s company.

279
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,580
If not Phupha, then who?

280
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:51,100
It’s just my assumption.

281
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,790
I’ll have someone investigate into it.

282
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,970
You both should stay cautious for the time being.

283
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:11,480
Run, can you come to see me? Phupa and his friend are here…ok

284
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:16,640
Run will come by. Why don’t you stay for dinner.

285
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,510
It’s ok. I was about to….

286
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:22,630
Aren’t you happy to get to see your fiancée?

287
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,000
She’s been worried about you.

288
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,280
When were you going to tell me about your fiancée?

289
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:58,690
I couldn’t find a perfect time to.

290
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:01,760
You couldn’t or you just didn’t want to?

291
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:03,750
Kram.

292
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:10,640
Give me time.

293
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:14,770
I promise I’ll tell everyone about us.

294
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:16,880
Arghhhh…..

295
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:19,540
Stop! Don’t touch my dad.

296
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,390
Arghhhh!!

297
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:29,910
Are you ok?

298
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:36,090
You’re bleeding so much!

299
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:38,900
He has Hemophilia.

300
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:42,740
Mum…mum!!!

301
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:46,540
Don’t tell anyone you have Hemophilia.

302
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:49,330
Got it. I won’t tell.

303
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:04,780
Yes. We have an emergency here at 65/583 Soi Thammarat 20

304
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:09,730
We need an ambulance right now. The injured has Hemophilia.

305
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:16,740
Noted. A patient’s been stabbed, and he has Hemophilia. House number is 65/583?

306
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,740
I’ve not told you he’s been stabbed.

307
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:28,850
No one’s picking up the phone! What’s happening? What should we do?

308
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,850
We’re framed.

309
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:34,370
I don’t think dad can take much more. Do something, Phupha!

310
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:35,950
Just hold down tight!

311
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,420
Uncle

312
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,360
Arghhhh!!

313
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,070
Just hang in there, dad.

314
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:43,120
There’s one more place I can think of. It’s far but safer than here.

315
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:44,780
Let’s go.

316
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:51,290
Patient has lost a lot of blood from Hemophilia.

317
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,710
And he’s an O-negative, which is very rare.

318
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,090
We don’t have enough stock in the blood bank.

319
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:01,630
What about Run. Can she donate?

320
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:05,840
I’m only his stepdaughter.

321
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:09,930
O-negative?

322
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:22,580
How is he?

323
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:28,210
We found O-negative just in time. The patient is out of critical condition.

324
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:39,380
I need to be somewhere. You both stay right here.

325
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:49,120
I’m not your real son, am I?

326
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:52,040
How do you know? Who told you?

327
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:57,370
I’ve known it since the beginning.

328
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,220
I’m uncle Viroj’s son.

329
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:09,120
This is why you sent people to take down both of us.

330
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:13,630
Calm down! It’s not what you think it is.

331
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,480
Why didn’t you tell me the truth!!!

332
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:20,580
Let’s not talk over the phone.

333
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,960
Come see me at the warehouse.

334
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:24,960
I’ll be there in an hour.

335
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,060
Sorry I was eavesdropping.

336
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:44,770
I’ve heard everything. Can I come too?

337
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:51,450
I’ll handle this by myself.

338
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:53,980
What if it’s another trap?

339
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,860
I need to know the truth.

340
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:00,030
You go home and wait for me there.

341
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:06,890
If I don’t come back by tomorrow morning, call the police.

342
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:10,480
You’re the only one I trust

343
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:16,070
Don’t you say that. I know you’ll be back.

344
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,820
Promise me you will?

345
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:25,410
I promise

346
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:22,180
Phupha.

347
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:55,120
Phupha.. Phupa!! I’m back!
