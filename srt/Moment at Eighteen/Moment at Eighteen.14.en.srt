1
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:04,880
Joon Woo.

2
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,500
Joon Woo, are you all right?

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,660
Soo Bin.

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,130
♬ Please don’t say a word ♬

5
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:24,130
♬ Cuz they all have been said now ♬

6
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:29,600
♬ Like a journey coming to an end ♬

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,930
♬ You say ♬

8
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,400
♬ Let it run like the river ♬

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,870
♬ Wild and without a care ♬

10
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,260
♬ Just like the days, ♬

11
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:46,310
♬ we were young and fumbling ♬

12
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,660
♬ Everything fades away ♬

13
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:52,980
♬ Let it go by with a flow ♬

14
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,360
♬ Really wish I could stay, ♬

15
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,740
♬ but you know me ♬

16
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,680
You're all grown up now, and I have a family.

17
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,130
I think we each have different paths we have to take.

18
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,510
You, in your own way, me, in my own way,

19
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,090
♬ Just close your eyes ♬

20
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,420
♬ and I'll be right by your side. ♬

21
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,380
♬ Cuz memories don’t say goodbye ♬

22
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,620
Where are you coming from?

23
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:53,630
What is he doing? What should I do?
What should I do? Please answer.

24
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,050
I'm going to my friend Chan Yeol's house
to do some homework.

25
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,220
Please take me.

26
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,000
Hurry.

27
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:59,050
Give me the ball, please.
Hurry!

28
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,770
We aren't finished eating the jjajangmyeon
(black bean noodles).

29
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,040
Thanks, jjajangmyeon Hyung.

30
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:31,100
- You...
- A while ago you came to our house to get the empty bowls.

31
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:35,820
- You have the best memory.
- It's because you're handsome.

32
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,560
You're the one who's handsome.

33
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,400
I hear that a lot!

34
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:07,640
Grow up with gusto, kiddo.

35
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,910
Yes.

36
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,420
Joon Woo.

37
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,300
Mom!

38
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:21,230
That hyung picked up the ball for me.

39
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:26,080
Dad, let's have jjajangmyeon today.

40
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,240
Go on in.

41
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:41,740
- Bye, Jjajangmyeon Hyung.
- Thank you.

42
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,490
What did you do?

43
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:59,440
Why does the kid have the same name as me?
Why?

44
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,760
When I named him, I thought that

45
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,980
I wanted to somehow make atonement through that.

46
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:12,690
Because I was so immature,
the things I didn't know then...

47
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,740
While giving our kid everything and
raising him devotedly, at least in this way...

48
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,940
Still, my name...

49
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:31,050
Your sense of naming really... stinks.

50
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,300
My mother

51
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:43,430
still thinks the first love a long time ago

52
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:47,560
was the most beautiful moment of her life.

53
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,880
She always longs...

54
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,680
for when she was 18.

55
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:05,680
She always tells me, "our dad was such a good man."

56
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,870
"He loved you so much."

57
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,150
She always told me that.

58
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,300
So I too

59
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:30,800
yearned a lot for the person who is dad.

60
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,660
I came because I didn't get to say this to you before.

61
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:49,790
I am sorry, Joon Woo.
I am sorry.

62
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,590
Don't worry.

63
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,690
Now, I...

64
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,830
I won't come looking for you again.

65
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:10,830
- Be healthy.
- Joon Woo.

66
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:19,840
- By chance, do you know Choi Myeong Joon?
- No. I don't know him.

67
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,630
By chance, do you know Choi Myeong Joon?

68
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:26,330
Choi Myeong Joon?
No.

69
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,300
Choi Myeong Joon.
Hello. I am Choi Joon Woo.

70
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:37,680
Today is my birthday.
I wanted you to come see me.

71
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:44,800
But I'm okay because Mom
told me today's the happiest day for me.

72
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,670
Dad, I want to see you.
Let's meet someday?

73
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,690
Hello. I'm Choi Joon Woo.

74
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:57,990
I don't know what to say now that I'm doing this.

75
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:02,610
Just... that I'm writing you
a letter to tell you that I yearned for you.

76
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:07,170
I was always curious about
what kind of person my dad was.

77
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:13,090
Occasionally, just occasionally,
I'll watch you from afar.

78
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:18,320
Also, that I am Choi Joon Woo,
just remember that for me.

79
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,890
Just the feeling of yearning...

80
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:31,580
Just cherishing that feeling is enough.

81
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,710
That feeling I used to feel...

82
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:45,460
- Honey!
- How dare you come home now after wandering about?!

83
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:50,520
After making a mess of the exams?
What? You made a joke out of the exams?

84
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,850
There's no way you would have gotten it wrong
because you didn't know the answer. Are you crazy?

85
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:57,080
You can just fix it for me again, though.

86
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:02,650
That's right. Maybe Teacher Oh Han Gyeol
doesn't go for solicitations? What should we do then?

87
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:08,580
- Hui Yeong!
- This punk, you're just dying to ruin me, aren't you?

88
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,730
The money I earned while working like a dog,
you can't wait to squander it,

89
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:16,340
- so you're just itching, huh?!
- Honey, honey! Please! Please!

90
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:19,220
Please hit me instead!
Hit me!

91
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:23,270
Fine, Park Geum Ja. Let's take care of you first.
All you do is drink while you're home.

92
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:27,630
You leave that kid to turn out like that?
This—

93
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:31,680
Let go. I said let go.
Let go! This dog-like...

94
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:37,450
You're right. I'm a dog.
Just like you. Trash.

95
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:41,340
What? This jerk!

96
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:46,200
I hated you being like this since I was little.

97
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,200
I used to think I never wanted to be like you,

98
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:56,380
but without realizing I was becoming just like you.

99
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,640
Stepping on those who are weaker than me,

100
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,120
a monster who uses whatever
method and means to get what I want.

101
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:09,070
Trash. I became that without a way to turn back.

102
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,190
But you know what?

103
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:17,010
I can't go back to when I wasn't like this.

104
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:23,860
I wanted to be better than you! But I can't.

105
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,810
- This jerk, how dare you, to your father?
- Honey, Honey.

106
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:29,610
Let go. Let go!

107
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:39,690
If you dare hit mom again, I won't let it slide.

108
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:54,070
Go. Run away. Hurry.

109
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:26,860
- Isn't this her?
- Oh wow, it is her. Kim Ji Min.

110
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,480
- Isn't this that place?
- Why are you tracking her down for Teacher Oh Han Gyeol?

111
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,810
- Are you trying to bother her?
- No.

112
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:38,150
I have my own reasons.

113
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:41,870
- But why are we speaking so quietly?
- Hey.

114
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:50,590
- Chan Yeol.
- Huh?

115
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:55,900
- Let me use your phone for a sec.
- Sure. Here.

116
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,080
Joon Woo, it's Yoo Soo Bin.
When you get to your job,

117
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,840
check the place where you park your bike for me.

118
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,070
You have this one, too. Here.

119
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:24,590
Oh, I'm so sleepy! Oh!

120
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:27,620
- Soo Bin, come out and get some air, too!
- Soo Bin!

121
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,660
Seriously, you're studying too hard!

122
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:35,800
Oh, Unni! Unni!
Our Unni! Oh!

123
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,230
Unni! Have you had dinner yet?

124
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,770
Um... I'm okay.

125
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:45,110
Aigoo, my grandma makes the best hot pot.

126
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,400
I'll be right back. Thanks.

127
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,560
- Yeah, be careful!
- Wow, I didn't expect her to be like that.

128
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:02,400
That's true love.
Do you know what love is?

129
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,960
Let's go.

130
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:39,290
I said don't do it!

131
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:43,040
Don't do it! Don't do it! Don't do it!

132
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,410
Don't you dare meet up with Soo Bin or even call her!
I'm hanging up.

133
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,880
Soo Bin.

134
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,980
I was at Chan Yeol's to do homework together.

135
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,240
- Oh, I heard.
- I'll go wash up.

136
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:07,280
Okay.
Hey, why didn't you tell me you met Dad?

137
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:14,130
Soo Bin.
Dad... I don't know what he said to you.

138
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:18,450
But it's not true!
He's just made it up because we fought.

139
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:22,020
- Don't worry about it, okay?
- Okay.

140
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:28,900
I'm being serious.
We have no problems with each other at all!

141
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,990
So you just have to study, that's all. Okay?

142
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:35,510
Hey, we have to have a party to celebrate.
It's too late, right?

143
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:39,880
So I was thinking.
How about a trip to Jejudo?

144
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:45,420
- Whatever you want to do.
- Okay. I'll try and plan it out then.

145
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,860
Okay.

146
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,780
What are you doing?

147
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:36,000
Is that funny?

148
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,760
No, I am.
That I'm hungry at a time like this.

149
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,490
Joon Woo, it's Yoo Soo Bin.
When you get to your job,

150
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:04,540
check the place where you park your bike for me.

151
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:59,490
Joon Woo, you were surprised earlier, right?

152
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:02,540
To be honest, Hui Yeong lent me his phone,

153
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:06,530
so I called you out of urgency.

154
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:11,900
But I happened to overhear, by chance,
that you were meeting up with that person.

155
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,890
I'm sorry... without getting permission...

156
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:19,050
You must be feeling bad.

157
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:22,270
How you must have felt

158
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:27,440
I know so well, so it upsets me.

159
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:33,330
When I had a hard time with my dad,
you comforted me.

160
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:36,530
I felt like I should do the same.

161
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,800
But since I can't be with you,

162
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:44,720
the only thing I can do for you
is send a letter like this.

163
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,060
But I'm here for you.
I'm always cheering you on every day,

164
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:54,280
in the morning, in the daytime,
when we're sleeping at night.

165
00:17:54,280 --> 00:18:00,290
So even with this little, let's try to bear it.

166
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:05,700
I miss you, and I like you a lot.

167
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,810
From Soo Bin.

168
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:09,840
Ji Min, did you have a good day today and study a lot, too?

169
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,490
Okay. Take your time and think about it.

170
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:17,430
I'll wait.

171
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:28,980
I have to wait until she feels okay.

172
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:44,950
Sleep well.

173
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:04,150
♬ The day on which a small door opened ♬

174
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:09,340
♬ and the world changed ♬

175
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:15,210
♬ was all about my feeling of happiness ♬

176
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:18,770
♬ It is blindingly bright. ♬

177
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:24,170
♬ I who am extending my insignificant hand ♬

178
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:29,880
♬ cautiously express hello with feeling ♬

179
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:36,560
♬ On another quiet afternoon ♬

180
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,480
I...

181
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:46,320
will try to do better,

182
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,920
so that I can be a more dependable person to you.

183
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:54,610
Sleep well.

184
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,080
Are you on a diet?

185
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,860
Kwon Da Huin's always on a diet.
And you're her boyfriend.

186
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,370
Ma Hui Yeong.

187
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,870
Eat.

188
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,930
You didn't use to be like this.

189
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,070
Why have you changed so much?

190
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,680
Enjoy it.
I'm leaving.

191
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,640
Jeong Oh Je, hi!

192
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:54,330
You're here?

193
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,990
Why are you so out of energy?
You said you made up with Da Huin.

194
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:09,960
Yeah. We did.

195
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:17,560
Should we talk for a sec?

196
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,890
Okay.

197
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:27,830
I should have told you first. Sorry.

198
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:34,650
You didn't have to tell me.
It's your choice.

199
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:41,650
I'm weird, aren't I?

200
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:45,350
No. It's just how you feel.

201
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:49,250
True.

202
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:58,000
I'm a little confused, too,
about what kind of feelings these are,

203
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:02,590
so I was in the process of figuring it out myself.

204
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:06,310
But then it turned out this way.

205
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,070
Hui Yeong.
Thanks.

206
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:18,200
You got to make the call?

207
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,240
I didn't pick up thinking it was you.

208
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,280
I got it last night, thanks.

209
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:51,420
- Really?
- What is this? It's weird.

210
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:57,230
Hey. What's weird?
It's a person liking another person.

211
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:04,250
- You're the weirder. Just play your game.
- Oh, Yoo Pil Sang, so unexpected!

212
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:14,070
Did you see it, Hui Yeong?

213
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:20,150
(Texts about Oh Je)

214
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,770
- What page are we on?
- I don't know.

215
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:53,800
You know, Jeong Oh Je and Kwon Da Huin—

216
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,780
Eun Seo Jin! Shut up!
That thing...

217
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:01,320
It's fine. Leave her alone.
She'll probably stop.

218
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,090
Hey, don't get bothered.

219
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:09,780
Da Huin, you're okay, right?

220
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:26,950
Hey, Jeong Oh Je! What happened? You said we were gonna come to school together. You said you'd carry my plant for me!

221
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:33,200
Oh, sorry. I had to babysit because my parents
had to go to the market in the morning.

222
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,420
Follow me.
There are so many things you need to carry for me.

223
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,570
Guys, we are going to the horticulture room.

224
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:51,470
Go ahead.

225
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:57,610
- Oh Je.
- Huh?

226
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:02,210
Don't be sorry towards me.
You don't need to be.

227
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:09,350
Also, don't make faces like that.
You look the nicest when you smile. Smile.

228
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:15,800
- Okay.
- Go.

229
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:25,980
Kwon Da Huin, what's up with you?
Heart's fluttering still.

230
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:34,840
Class 2-3's male student, Jeong Oh Je,
likes grade manipulator, Ma Hui Yeong. Is this real?

231
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,600
Yeah, Joon Woo.

232
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:54,140
- Teach.
- Something going on?

233
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:04,400
Why are you so serious?
You're making me nervous. Go on and tell me.

234
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:10,100
I... visited an academy.

235
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,250
Why?

236
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,550
The... ladybug...

237
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:22,490
Ladybug Academy... does what there?

238
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:26,810
- Drawings.
- Drawings?

239
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:34,220
Drawings, then by chance...

240
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:40,290
You're saying you're going to decide on the path to take?

241
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:48,100
Drawing, art, art college.

242
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:54,780
Hooray!
Hooray! Hooray.

243
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:58,970
Now, from now on, you're going to go for it?

244
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:02,260
Good thinking.
I knew since the day you drew that ladybug!

245
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:06,030
You have the skills!

246
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,400
But I haven't completely decided yet.

247
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:14,200
No, first, let's get going with it and not waste any time.

248
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,490
But still, you should study it a little more systematically.

249
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:22,920
Yes. So I am looking into a few places,

250
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:27,100
but it's not so easy.

251
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,140
Right.

252
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:39,070
Oh right, my successor in the army runs
an art preparatory academy.

253
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:41,900
Should I at least ask him, for you?

254
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,300
He's not as good looking as me, but still,

255
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:49,970
it seems like he's a little bit well-known
in terms of prepping for art colleges.

256
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,770
Right, prepping for art colleges isn't so easy.

257
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:59,470
But still, I'll help you.

258
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:04,860
Would that be alright?

259
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:07,320
It's alright.

260
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:11,470
Thank you.

261
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:16,820
I'll let him know, so go see him at the academy.

262
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:20,020
You have to do these sorts of things
right away as soon as you get the feeling.

263
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:23,780
Joon Woo, let's go for it, huh?!

264
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:33,510
Soo Bin.

265
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:41,120
You didn't sleep well last night?

266
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:46,150
I couldn't sleep well after reading your letter.

267
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:48,580
Because I was so touched.

268
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,720
It's nothing.

269
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,760
I thought about what I could do for you,

270
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,250
and that was the only thing.

271
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,610
Should we do that the next time we have things to say?

272
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:07,140
Sometimes...
when it feels too overwhelming to put into words?

273
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,930
Soo Bin.

274
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:20,370
- I have a goal now. What to do in the future.
- Like what?

275
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:25,160
It's not specific yet, but since I like drawing,

276
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:29,480
I'm going to study with that as my goal.

277
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,390
Really?
Good job.

278
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:37,800
I really like your drawing, too.

279
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,990
I'll cheer you on sincerely.

280
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:48,600
It's thanks to you.
Because of you, I've decided to live a better life

281
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,510
and have a dream, too.

282
00:31:52,510 --> 00:32:00,610
You... changed a lot. I'm proud of you.

283
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:04,530
Right? Oh, right.

284
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:07,060
What is it?

285
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:10,700
I promised not to meet privately with you like this.

286
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,190
I have to keep that promise.

287
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,660
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

288
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:30,440
Joon Woo.

289
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:36,790
You... are really a good person.

290
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,770
So Ye.

291
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:55,730
I came because I didn't think you'd eat if I didn't show up.

292
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:57,340
You have something to say?

293
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:00,060
To thank you for the other day in front of Sang Hoon.

294
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:03,460
Okay. I'll get going.

295
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:06,340
So Ye.

296
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:11,450
I'm really trying hard to be an honorable person to you.

297
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:14,200
So please give me one more chance.

298
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:18,970
Give me one more chance.

299
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,860
Did you do well on the exams?

300
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,640
Aren't you going to take this?

301
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:44,090
I heard about you.

302
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:48,470
It's your choice, but don't get me involved.

303
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,920
Don't worry. It will never happen.

304
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,080
It's just my issue.

305
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:04,450
Teacher, by chance, is there anyone you know
who works in the field of prepping for art colleges?

306
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,990
Teacher Oh!

307
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:08,140
Teacher Oh! There's a huge problem.

308
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:10,290
Please go on ahead.

309
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:16,990
I got a call from the Office of Education.

310
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,100
Ah, daebak!

311
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,880
People from the Office of Education
came because of Ma Hui Yeong.

312
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,580
Daebak!

313
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:37,990
Let me! Let me see!

314
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:48,600
Hey! What are you guys doing!
Get back to class! Hurry.

315
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,990
Sang Hoon, go! Quickly.

316
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:57,520
Okay. I will.

317
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:07,180
Ma Hui Yeong, did you know about the grade manipulation
that happened during the second semester of last year?

318
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:13,490
I'll speak for him.
During that time, Hui Yeong himself didn't know—

319
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:18,490
Let's have Ma Hui Yeong tell us.

320
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,850
I just found out recently.

321
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,110
I acknowledge everything.

322
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:31,430
I'll cooperate with the investigation.

323
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:40,200
If the grade manipulation is proven to have happened,
you and the teachers involved

324
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:44,930
and your parents will receive punishment.

325
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:46,820
Finally,

326
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:51,420
you will receive zero grades accordingly.

327
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:30,640
Hey.
Aren't you relieved?

328
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:32,800
Was it you?

329
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,300
What?
You think it was me? Oh wow.

330
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:42,240
I should have been, but sadly, it wasn't.

331
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,060
I'm being serious!

332
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:50,610
What's up with you, Joon Woo?
Love-hate became friendship or what?

333
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,240
I'm so glad.

334
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:02,930
If he's guilty, he should be punished.

335
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,190
I thought it was you, that's all.

336
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:32,590
Hello?
Dad, it's Sang Hoon.

337
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:41,860
Are you nuts?

338
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,680
Don't be ridiculous!

339
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:58,010
Variability means it can be chance.

340
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:01,400
Technical level which uses variability or

341
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:14,620
for example, in the past,
we didn't have the technical ability to use bacteria,

342
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:17,410
so it was just a natural object, but how is it now?

343
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:20,000
It's become a very important resource.

344
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,430
It means it's worth changing this way.

345
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:24,470
Also, the resource—

346
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,400
- Vice Principal.
- Teacher Oh.

347
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:35,470
How could something like this
happen without my knowing?

348
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:40,920
Something scandalous like this happening
in all my 25 years as an educator...

349
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,380
I won't get fired, by chance?

350
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,290
Then what do I do?
I can't become a principal...

351
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,050
No, no, no. No way.

352
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:52,590
Do your best with the investigation and finish it up well.

353
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:00,200
I've devoted so many years to this school.

354
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,220
No way it would happen.

355
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:18,770
Teach, there's something I'd like to consult with you about.

356
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:25,250
Consult? I'm okay anytime.
Right now? Here in school?

357
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:28,680
I'd like to meet you outside of school.

358
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:32,850
Sure, sure. Where?

359
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,880
Chan Yeol, I just got here.
You're not here yet?

360
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:47,120
Teach! Have you met up with that unni?

361
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:52,230
This kid... You're asking for trouble.

362
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,880
Ji Min...

363
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:04,530
I'm not going to see you anymore.
Go home.

364
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:07,870
I will. But let's talk a little.

365
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:13,900
Teacher, I'm too lacking for you to like.

366
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:17,750
I'm working a part-time job like this because
I can't get a job,

367
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:21,020
and there are tons of people
I have to take care of back home.

368
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:26,090
Well, your job is stable and you're a good person,
so I want to keep on seeing you,

369
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,480
but the more that happens, I more insecure I feel.

370
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:33,450
Why do you say such a thing?
That's not true.

371
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:37,230
I'm sorry. I'll be going in now.

372
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:40,560
Enjoy the drink. Good-bye.

373
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,710
Wait, Ji Min...

374
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:54,200
Thanks, Chan Yeol.
I met up with her.

375
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:59,230
Please do well this time, Teach.

376
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,500
What's wrong with my eyes?

377
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,650
Why would she say...

378
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:29,270
We could just keep dating like normal.
Why is it so complicated?

379
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:56,630
What are you doing?

380
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:59,020
Oh right, you're working.

381
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,330
It was me after all.

382
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:06,460
Whistle-blower. It was me.

383
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:15,530
I called my dad earlier from school because I got a feeling.

384
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:18,290
He reported it.

385
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:23,470
Why would he dig up the past now?

386
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:28,780
What about his job?
Wasn't that why you held back?

387
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,380
He quit his job.

388
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,980
He has nothing to lose now,
so he says he can do whatever he wants.

389
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:39,880
Then he should have told me.
Why would he quit his job and stuff?

390
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:45,140
If he had told me back then, Hui Yeong...
I don't know. I don't know.

391
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:48,160
It's good. It's a good thing.

392
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,320
Oh, I'm so relieved! Seriously.

393
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:54,230
Why? What?

394
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:56,450
You don't feel good, right?

395
00:42:57,690 --> 00:42:59,260
No. No.

396
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:02,260
I-I feel so good.

397
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:04,100
I'm so relieved. So, so relieved.

398
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:14,310
It's already happened.

399
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,050
Leave now.

400
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:21,280
Okay. I should.

401
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:24,800
Choi Joon Woo.

402
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,600
Lee Gi Tae, what are you doing here?

403
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,980
By chance, have you seen Hui Yeong?

404
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:31,500
This jerk is obsessed with him again!

405
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:34,270
No, he's being strange.

406
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:38,710
He suddenly sent me a text saying
he was sorry and I can't contact him.

407
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:40,860
The academy said he quit.

408
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:43,860
So?

409
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:49,370
Well... I wondered if he stopped by here.

410
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:51,130
I'll leave.

411
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,650
Go then.

412
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:01,460
I'm leaving.

413
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:25,610
Let's try and find him at least.

414
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:28,720
He must have gone home after wandering around.

415
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,810
It's raining, too.

416
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:31,130
I feel so uneasy.

417
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:34,020
- His phone is off, too.
- Maybe something's happened.

418
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:37,510
What do you mean?!
Stop being so rash!

419
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:44,880
Yeah, Oh Je.

420
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,780
Yeah, what are you doing?

421
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:48,570
Oh, I...

422
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:54,310
Hui Yeong?
He'll go home himself.

423
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:09,300
Finally, you will receive a grade of zero.

424
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:21,130
That bastard.
I almost thought... Seriously.

425
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:25,330
Hui Yeong, let's get you home.

426
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:30,930
Let me go. Let me go, punk, I said!

427
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:36,050
He still hasn't learned. It's enough knowing
that he's okay. Let's go.

428
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:43,200
Just let me be trash and let me get destroyed!

429
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:47,900
Why?
Are you happy seeing me break into pieces, too?

430
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:52,390
Are you having fun?
I said to leave, you bastard!

431
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:57,940
You guys go home.

432
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:05,480
Hey, Lee Gi Tae, let's go!

433
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:15,790
What are you doing here?
Making the guys worry.

434
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:18,080
What do you care?

435
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,930
You're a coward even now.

436
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:24,200
Are you trying to be forgiven this way?

437
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,820
I have no intention of being forgiven.

438
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:31,560
You and your pride even now...

439
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:36,500
Then why are you so tormented?

440
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:41,620
Saying the word "sorry"
to me hurts your pride that much?

441
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:47,320
Is it that hard to acknowledge your mistake?

442
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,000
Do you know why I've just been watching you?

443
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:57,050
Because I feel really sorry for you.

444
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:09,120
You acting this way right now,
you feel tormented because you know were wrong.

445
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:13,640
Don't avoid it and resolve it.

446
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:17,820
Take responsibility and fix it yourself.

447
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:21,470
Don't be such a coward.

448
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:28,260
It's your last chance.

449
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:49,420
This is your birthday?

450
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:51,430
Yeah.

451
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:54,840
It wasn't on the school's bulletin board.

452
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:58,300
Oh, that's because my mom reported my birth late.

453
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:04,700
I'll take care of your birthday this time no matter what.

454
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:07,330
Okay. I am looking forward to it.

455
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,050
Joon Woo's birthday

456
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:13,870
It's his birthday today...

457
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,900
- Did you just go home?
- Yeah.

458
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:53,090
Guys.

459
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:56,670
I have something to say.

460
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:01,660
Today I'll tell Teach that I won't be president anymore.

461
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:05,130
I don't need to tell you why I'm not fit to be one.

462
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:10,350
From now on,
I think Joon Woo will do a great job with class management.

463
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:14,180
I'm sorry for not being able to finish off the term.

464
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:19,030
Hey, hey. President Ma,
why are you making the decision by yourself?

465
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:21,900
You should ask for our opinions, too.

466
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,250
I don't think there's a need.

467
00:49:57,070 --> 00:50:01,430
Hui Yeong. Let's talk.

468
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:02,990
It's okay, don't console me.

469
00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:04,950
I'm not trying to console you.

470
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:10,470
I was just worried about you.
You don't look okay right now.

471
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:15,260
Ma Hui Yeong kiddo?
Let's stop that from now on.

472
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:18,020
Acting like we're close when we aren't.

473
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:20,310
Why do you say things like that?

474
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:24,590
Fine, I was mad at you. I didn't understand you.

475
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:29,650
But since we're still friends, we can't ignore it.

476
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:33,380
It's because it's summer.

477
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:38,120
I'm fine.

478
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,940
Hui Yeong.

479
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:42,020
Thanks for worrying about me.

480
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:49,980
Let her be.

481
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:54,660
Just let him go around proudly, just like his concept.

482
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,360
Don't worry too much about it now.

483
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:02,100
That's right. Just protect your love.

484
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:08,640
Guys, can I ask a favor?

485
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,290
What is it?

486
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:16,080
Honestly, today is Choi Joon Woo's birthday.

487
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:21,710
I have a gift that I thought about.
I will buy it so will you please give it to him?

488
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:23,820
Yoo Soo Bin, you coward.

489
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:26,290
Can't you even give a birthday gift personally?

490
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:29,630
If you're going to be like that then quit it...
with Choi Joon Woo.

491
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:33,500
Why? So that you will try again?
You won't be it even if you reincarnate a hundred times.

492
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:34,540
Not a hundred times, you know!

493
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:37,590
No. Even a hundred is lacking.

494
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:40,540
That's right. It's his birthday after all.

495
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:43,230
Giving his gift is a bit...

496
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:46,720
♬ Honestly I still don't know ♬

497
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,970
Hey, friends.

498
00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:50,500
♬ My feeling that it's you who brushed by ♬

499
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:53,890
Should Chan Yeol's special investigation team
step in once more?

500
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:56,300
♬ Warmly bloom ♬

501
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:59,140
♬ It already is saturated ♬

502
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:02,440
Please, just this once.
Today is Soo Bin's boyfriend's birthday.

503
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:05,150
That's right.
It's his first birthday after they started dating.

504
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:06,790
We beg you like this. Okay?

505
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,170
No!

506
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:11,120
How much is it?
We will pay you.

507
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,480
Hey! Jeez! I'm sorry.

508
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,370
I'll give you a free tarot card reading!

509
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:19,390
I'm really good at it! Or we can find someone for you!
We're really good at that.

510
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:20,450
That's right.

511
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:22,120
I'm sorry.

512
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:26,280
Have you not been in love?

513
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:30,140
No!
If you have, then you would know how she feels.

514
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:32,070
That's right.

515
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:34,230
Please.

516
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:36,210
Follow me.

517
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,640
Hurry. Hurry.

518
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,980
One hour. We only have one hour.

519
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,040
We don't have time. Let's start.

520
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,540
Okay!

521
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:47,600
What are you going to do?

522
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:50,410
You need to be pretty if you are going
to meet your boyfriend.

523
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:54,010
You need to be fixed prettily and
make Choi Joon Woo faint.

524
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:56,570
Hurry hurry.

525
00:52:56,570 --> 00:52:59,320
- Let's go.
- Please.

526
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:04,990
It hurts.

527
00:53:04,990 --> 00:53:07,220
Bear with it.

528
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:12,150
Why isn't Hwang Ro Mi not coming?

529
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:14,320
Did she run away again?

530
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:17,100
What do you take Ro Mi for?

531
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:21,770
That's pretty.

532
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:24,900
- You have such good sense.
- So pretty.

533
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,530
If Soo Bin comes in then he comes...

534
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:29,810
Why isn't he coming?

535
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:00,320
Yes, Mom?

536
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:03,200
Joon Woo, I'm sorry.

537
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:07,950
Today is your birthday and I wasn't able to prepare
seaweed soup (traditional soup every birthday) this morning.

538
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:11,850
It's okay.
Birthdays are nothing special.

539
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:15,280
Don't worry about it.
Are you doing well?

540
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,290
Is the restaurant doing well?

541
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:20,320
Of course, it is.

542
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:23,070
You are going to your part-time work early today?

543
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:24,810
I have somewhere to stop by first.

544
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:28,990
Yes, Mom.
I will call tonight too.

545
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:31,300
My baby, work hard.

546
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:33,250
Congratulations.

547
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:48,840
Two, three.

553
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:04,460
Blow the candles out.

554
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:07,880
Live a long happy life!

555
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:12,570
Thank you.
Thank you guys.

556
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:15,240
We didn't prepare a gift separately.

557
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,160
It's okay.

558
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:20,470
But instead, we have a group present.

559
00:55:20,470 --> 00:55:24,440
Now, come in.

560
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:37,150
♬ I whose thoughts are filled with you ♬

564
00:55:46,790 --> 00:55:50,930
♬ I wish you would stay ♬

565
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:56,450
♬ Even if the day is not significant ♬

566
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:02,630
Happy Birthday.

567
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:13,190
You can't be here though.
Let's go.

568
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:17,480
Wait. It's your birthday today.
It's a birthday favor.

569
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:18,250
That's right.

570
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:20,700
That's right, Joon Woo.
Just meet for a bit.

571
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,080
We will leave.

572
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:25,980
Then we're all dismissed.
We'll leave the cake here.

573
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:27,320
We'll be off.

574
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,260
Let's go.

575
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,470
We're off.

576
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:34,510
Bye.

577
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:51,690
Don't worry.
I will be going soon.

578
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,550
Where did the bodyguard unnie go?

579
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:02,560
She said she would keep a time check.

580
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:03,630
Did she just go?

581
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:05,400
I don't know where she went but she has good sense.

582
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,330
Then should we go to our store?

583
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:09,480
My treat.

584
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,450
- Okay.
- Heol!

585
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:13,400
Kwon Da Huin, you're so good-natured.

586
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:16,800
What? We're just going to eat ddeokkbokki
(spicy rice cakes).

587
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,490
Let's go.

588
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:23,920
They'll be okay, right?

589
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:29,370
I wanted to cheer you on with your birthday gift.

590
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:39,990
Thanks.

591
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:48,080
Let's go down. I will take you home.

592
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:53,050
Let's stay for a bit. I came all the way here.

593
00:57:54,810 --> 00:57:56,890
Let's go down.

594
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:02,190
I want to see you open this first.

595
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:09,030
We promised your mom that you
won't come back here anymore.

596
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:14,840
I will put this inside.

597
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:39,700
I...
how hard it was for me to come all the way here.

598
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:47,980
I was really scared, too, and it made me feel guilty.

599
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:51,450
But I still mustered up the courage
to come all the way here.

600
00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:53,980
It's your birthday today.

601
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:03,920
You will be by yourself if I'm not here,
so I can just be with you at least for the day.

602
00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:25,700
I will take you home.

603
00:59:27,910 --> 00:59:31,690
Okay. I will go by myself.

604
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:33,660
Yoo Soo Bin.

605
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:41,320
How much I am holding in,
hanging in there and how I'm bearing this situation,

606
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:47,480
you know that.

607
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,820
But if you come here...

608
00:59:56,170 --> 00:59:58,780
I'll become really bad.

609
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:09,900
I'm also having a hard time
but I am holding it in well. So...

610
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:42,260
I'm sorry.

~ Preview ~

613
01:01:29,070 --> 01:01:33,170
- Thank you for today. It was the best birthday since I was born.
- Really?

614
01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:34,890
Teacher Oh Han Gyeol sent me here.

615
01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:37,170
Choi Joon Woo?
As Hyung Han Gyeol said, you really do have talent.

616
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:38,980
Let's tear them apart now.

617
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:41,640
Joon Woo, can't he transfer?

618
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:43,650
Please do me this favor once.

619
01:01:43,650 --> 01:01:46,330
Soo Bin, I'm really having a hard time today.

620
01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:51,160
It may be hard now,
but maybe it will be better after a bit of time.

621
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:53,220
Ji Min dating me or not...

622
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:55,240
you should decide on it on your own.

♬ It is blindingly bright. ♬

624

Why didn't you tell me all this while?

625
01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:03,850
Joon Woo.

626
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:08,170
I know you will be so hurt so how could I tell you?

627
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:11,360
Leaving you be until you have become like this.

628
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,800
That is what I regret and am hurt about the most.

629
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,950
What on earth this emotion is...

630
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:18,460
He's the one I despise and I still can't even forgive him.

631
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:20,470
Ma Hui Yeong!
