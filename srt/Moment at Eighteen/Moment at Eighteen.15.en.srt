1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:03,870
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:16,260
♬ Like a precious memory of a very long time ago ♬

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,090
♬ It is still here. ♬

4
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:31,010
♬ Although I was one step too far away, I know ♬

5
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:36,110
♬ The flowers and the blue sky ♬

6
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,790
♬ When the one or two times which faded ♬

7
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:50,100
♬ become clear ♬

8
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:55,530
♬ The day on which a small door opened ♬

9
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,790
♬ and the world changed ♬

10
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:06,670
♬ was all about my feeling of happiness ♬

11
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,330
♬ It is blindingly bright. ♬

12
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:15,580
♬ I who am extending my insignificant hand ♬

13
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,050
♬ cautiously express hello with feeling ♬

14
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,590
What is it?
♬ cautiously express hello with feeling ♬

15
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,380
Joon Woo, I'll just go alone today.

16
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,180
I'm really okay.

17
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,630
I want to go today, though.

18
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,950
It's my birthday, too,

19
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:43,210
and... I don't want to send you back alone.

20
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:59,630
Episode 15:
A Way to Comfort Wounds

21
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,530
Go in.

22
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,970
Okay. Thanks for walking me back.

23
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,870
I don't want you to get lost.

24
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,040
I was sorry about earlier.

25
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,040
For saying that without thinking about your feelings.

26
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,710
Me too.

27
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:39,900
I know how you feel.
You're worried that I'll get told off by my mom,

28
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,950
and whether she knows or not,
that you did it to keep your promise.

29
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,250
Thank you for today.

30
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,100
It was the best birthday since I was born.

31
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,740
Really?

32
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,000
I'll go.

33
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,400
Joon Woo, Happy Birthday.

34
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,220
Thank you.

35
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,150
Go now.

36
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,770
You're home early.

37
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,060
I ended my meeting early today.

38
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,310
She wasn't around...

39
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,320
I told her to quit.

40
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,660
When I thought about it,
I felt like I was keeping you caged,

41
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,590
and your grades went up, too.

42
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:02,180
Mom, to be honest, today was Joon Woo's birthday.

43
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,420
The promise I made to you, I know I shouldn't break it,

44
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,610
but I really wanted to celebrate his birthday for him,
so I went over to his house.

45
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:12,460
I pleaded with that lady to let me.

46
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:18,890
I didn't go alone but with Chan Yeol and Da Huin,
the whole group.

47
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,690
I'm sorry.

48
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,910
You knew you shouldn't break your promise,
so why did you?

49
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,490
Because I like Joon Woo.

50
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,050
From now on, I'll keep the promise I made to you.

51
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,720
I'll go to the academy that you found,

52
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,320
and just like you want...

53
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,000
No, I'll figure it out myself and do better.

54
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,600
Enough. I got it.

55
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,430
You're saying you'll figure it out yourself.

56
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,150
There's a level test going on today,
but if you don't want to take it, don't.

57
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,640
I'll do it.
Thanks for looking into it.

58
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,510
At what time is it?
I should get ready for it.

59
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,340
Soo Bin.

60
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,390
Take this. It must be inconvenient.

61
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,650
Unni, have you been well?

62
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,060
I sent you texts to ask how you are,
but you haven't replied at all.

63
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,360
- You're so bad.
- Yes. I was busy.

64
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,890
I'm on my way to Seoul,

65
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:48,320
so I made some side dishes to bring over to you.

66
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,440
Should I bring them to your office?

67
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,000
No, never mind the side dishes.

68
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,700
Yeon Woo, I'm sorry, but I'm busy at the moment,
so I have to hang up.

69
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,750
Oh, okay.

70
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:02,240
It's just that I stopped by since it's Joon Woo's birthday.

71
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,630
But I understand.
Call me later then.

72
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:12,050
♪ Happy Birthday to you.

73
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:22,740
Live a long happy life!

74
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,800
Now, come in.

75
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,820
Let's meet for a second, Yeon Woo.

76
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:17,050
Hello. Is Teacher Lee Jeong Min here?

77
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,760
That's me.

78
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,590
Teacher Oh Han Gyeol sent me here.

79
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:24,080
Choi Joon Woo?
Nice to meet you.

80
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,270
It wasn't too far?

81
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,050
No, it was okay.

82
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,010
Come in.

83
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,430
Have you studied drawing before?

84
00:07:54,430 --> 00:08:00,440
No. When I was really little, I went to a little academy.

85
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,740
As Hyung Han Gyeol said, you really do have talent.

86
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,450
Have you always liked to draw?

87
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,020
Yes.

88
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:13,800
Since I was young, doodling made me feel calmer.

89
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,170
And it seemed to make me feel happier, too.

90
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:20,180
That's good! That's talent!

91
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,330
But the entrance exam isn't easy.

92
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,510
You're a little late in getting started,
so you'll have to work harder than others.

93
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,230
Yes.

94
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,760
Then should we start from today?

95
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,430
Yes.

96
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,620
Joon Woo.

97
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,200
A little bit like this.

98
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,400
Yeon Woo...

99
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:56,320
You knew about Soo Bin and Joon Woo, right?

100
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,160
Yeon Woo, can I make a request?

101
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,730
What kind of...

102
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:16,020
Joon Woo...
Couldn't he transfer to where you are?

103
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,220
What?

104
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,330
I don't think they should be in Seoul together.

105
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:30,830
I thought about taking Soo Bin and making her transfer,
but I can't because of my job.

106
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:35,780
But Joon Woo, being with his mom might be better.

107
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,390
Yeon Woo, I know how selfish I'm being right now.

108
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,670
I know too well. I'm really sorry.

109
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:46,770
But this as good as I can be when it comes to my kid.

110
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,430
I'm too much of a coward, aren't I?

111
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,360
I'm sorry.

112
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,590
But Yeon Woo, Soo Bin right now...

113
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:04,370
it's because I think she really likes him.

114
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,600
I think she likes him so much.

115
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,490
You know how passionate kids are at that age.

116
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:16,920
Even if they try not to get in too deep,
they can't control their feelings.

117
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:22,810
I know, of course, that he takes after you
and has a very good character.

118
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:26,440
He's nice and everything.

119
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:32,610
But right now, Yeon Woo,
they need to concentrate more on their studies.

120
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:38,590
I think you'd want him to concentrate
more on studying right now, too.

121
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:47,820
Yeon Woo, let's just separate the kids for now.

122
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,150
At least the two of us have to be more
harsh with our feelings. What can we do?

123
00:10:55,830 --> 00:11:01,420
Yeon Woo, I really... I'm very sorry.

124
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:06,730
I'm so sorry. I'm begging you.

125
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,280
Please listen to my plea, just once.

126
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:23,990
By chance, have you met with Joon Woo?

127
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:36,270
You didn't give him a scar, did you?

128
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,960
Unni, you're not the only one who's a mom.

129
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,340
I'm a mom, too.

130
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:05,670
I'm not as capable as you are, but I'm also a mom.

131
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:11,030
I also can do whatever it takes for Joon Woo.

132
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,290
If it's for my child's sake, there's nothing I'm afraid of.

133
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:19,600
But I respect Joon Woo's feelings.

134
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,030
His feelings,

135
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:27,690
to me, they're more precious
than anything else in this world.

136
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,920
Unni! Unnie!
Those kinds of things, I...

137
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,800
don't want to be careless about.

138
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:55,280
Soo Bin's mom doesn't know that you're dating yet, right?

139
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,790
No.

140
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:05,280
Teacher...

141
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,900
Teacher.

142
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,340
Yes?

143
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,810
I...

144
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,740
have to go to my part-time job.

145
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,500
Oh, okay, Joon Woo.

146
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,620
But will you be able to do this while you're working?

147
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,520
Of course. I can do it.

148
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,150
I'll clean up, so go ahead.

149
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:27,450
Thank you.
Good-bye.

150
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,620
- Yeah, Joon Woo!
- Teach!

151
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:02,010
I went to the academy you referred me to.

152
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:05,320
Oh, okay.
How was it? Did you do well?

153
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,310
- Yes.
- That's a relief.

154
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:11,430
Hey, Joon Woo,
that teacher is pretty capable, okay?

155
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:15,740
So listen to him well,
and all you have to do is work hard.

156
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,270
Don't worry about anything.

157
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,770
Yes, Teach. I'll try my best.

158
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,300
Oh, by the way, thank you very much.

159
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,110
In my life, you're a very big...

160
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,040
Very big what?

161
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,550
Savior.

162
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,760
Oh, okay.
Yeah, well... what do you mean?

163
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,140
What do you mean a savior?

164
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:48,000
- Are you going to work?
- Yes.

165
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:51,350
Okay, work hard.

166
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:55,020
And study hard whenever you have time.

167
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,580
Okay then.

168
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:14,220
So this is... for--

169
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,880
- Forced transfer.
- Shh, be quiet.

170
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,400
Hey, you...

171
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,320
This is unexpected.

172
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,100
You're very talented.
You drew this ladybug well.

173
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,040
Sorry for being late.

174
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:59,300
Kang Woo Group's Ma Yoon Gi to be investigated
for soliciting grade manipulation.

175
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,620
Choi Joon Woo

176
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:59,350
Joon Woo, Happy Birthday.

177
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:04,600
It's the first time in my life where
I felt like someone's birthday was this precious.

178
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,950
Do this I said.

179
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:10,720
No, like that.
That's good.

180
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,330
Let's just do this instead.

181
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:17,040
I thought saying, "Thanks for being born,"
was a cliche,

182
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,550
but I realized after meeting you.

183
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,560
Joon Woo, thanks for being born.

184
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,590
You're the most precious person to me.

185
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:32,130
I prepared this for you now that you've found
a path for yourself, but I don't know much about art.

186
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,170
I don't know if this is right.

187
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:38,200
Even if it's not great, hope you'll like the effort.

188
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,110
To Joon Woo

189
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,780
From Soo Bin.

190
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:45,320
Why wouldn't it be great?
You gave it to me.

191
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,460
Joon Woo!

192
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,420
Joon Woo!

193
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,890
Mom?

194
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:59,050
Thanks for the meal.

195
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,110
- Is it good?
- Yeah.

196
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,170
But it's not good you're eating at bedtime.

197
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:10,750
No.

198
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,890
I don't usually eat dinner, so I'm hungry.

199
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:17,090
Today is a very meaningful day.

200
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:21,340
It's your birthday and the first day of art academy.

201
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:25,410
To be honest,
Teacher Han Gyeol made a lot of effort for me.

202
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,520
He looked into the art academy for me.

203
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,350
and he talked to them well for me so
I can attend without feeling burdened.

204
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:35,030
I know. I'm so thankful to him.

205
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,260
I have to do better.

206
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,590
Mom.

207
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,230
Still,

208
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:51,600
I think I met a lot of good people
after coming to this school.

209
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,750
I met Teacher Han Gyeol and...

210
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,370
And met Soo Bin, too?

211
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,260
By the way...

212
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:21,630
You didn't give Joon Woo a scar, did you?

213
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:28,500
Mom still thinks about her first love from a long time ago

214
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,830
as the most beautiful moment in her life.

215
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:35,630
The moment she was 18, she still longs for it.

216
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,500
Mom, you have something to say to me, don't you?

217
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,860
Uh-uh. No.

218
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:47,610
No... I think there is.

219
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,880
Joon Woo.

220
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:56,190
You grew up so well and good.

221
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:59,590
Thank you for being born as my son.

222
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:03,670
♬ Happy Birthday to you.

223
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,400
- Eat a lot.
- Okay.

224
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:39,570
Did he like the present?

225
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,390
I want to see him.

226
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,630
It's hard.

227
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:12,600
But the exam isn't easy.

228
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,000
You're getting started late,
so you'll have to work harder.

229
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:21,570
♬ For me ♬

230
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:24,420
♬ Even if I stay up all night ♬

231
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:27,760
♬ It’s alright ♬

232
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:33,730
♬ I want to draw your pretty face ♬

233
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:38,110
♬ And hear your voice ♬

234
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,950
♬ Dear my love ♬

235
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:46,320
♬ Only remember that we used to love ♬

236
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:49,080
♬ Tears fall ♬

237
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,530
♬ Without even knowing ♬

238
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:53,090
♬ If only I knew how it felt ♬

239
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:57,130
♬ To miss someone ♬

240
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,510
Joon Woo!

241
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,490
Hey, did you sort out your feelings?

242
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:18,230
Yeah. I'm much (translates to han gyeol) better.

243
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:23,390
Seriously, I'm over it.
What about you?

244
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,060
Well, me too.

245
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:29,160
I'm Han Gyeol better, too.

246
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,740
Da Huin!

247
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,800
- Jeong Oh Je, hi!
- Hi.

248
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,270
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

249
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:39,060
We decided to be best friends.

250
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:42,020
Oh, so cool. So so cool.

251
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:45,050
- Should we head in?
- Okay.

252
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:48,700
Oh, you best friends, let's go!

253
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,310
Let's go!

254
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:53,400
- With Han Gyeol better feelings!
- Seriously!

255
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,410
Thanks for the present, yesterday.

256
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,780
Really.

257
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,250
Really, really I was touched.

258
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,670
And I went to the academy yesterday.

259
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,590
Oh, really?

260
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,870
How was it?

261
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,110
I liked it.

262
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:30,110
Since it was just full of kids that do art,

263
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,690
it was very exciting.

264
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,850
The art teacher is capable as well.

265
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:40,720
I think I'll be able to learn a lot from now on.

266
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,290
I'm glad.

267
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,180
I'm so happy.

268
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:49,950
But won't it get harder for you?

269
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:53,340
Going to the academy and then the job.
Will you be able to do both?

270
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,350
Isn't the academy a bit far, too?

271
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:02,040
I have to. I can do it.

272
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,540
I'm Choi Joon Woo.

273
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,640
Choi meaning the best.

274
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:10,330
Okay.

275
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:15,520
I went to the academy yesterday, too.

276
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,160
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

277
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:24,030
I told my mom the truth that
I went over to celebrate your birthday.

278
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,090
Was it okay?

279
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,120
Yeah.

280
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,450
I told her I'd work harder.

281
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:35,460
Thankfully, I think she feels a little better.

282
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,370
I went to take a level test at the academy
she wanted me to, too.

283
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,170
You worked hard.

284
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,110
You worked hard, too.

285
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,830
- You did well.
- You worked hard.

286
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,090
Teach.

287
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,730
Joon Woo.

288
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:17,030
Let's talk for a sec.

289
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,800
Yes.

290
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,460
Joon Woo.

291
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:26,780
Listen to me carefully to what I have to say.

292
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:32,470
The Board of Education will be coming out
to do an audit over Hui Yeong's case.

293
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:37,610
I think they'll start to investigate the matters over

294
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:40,170
grade manipulation as well
as things that have to do with you.

295
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:45,970
I feel like it's going to open your wounds again

296
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:48,910
so I feel bad,

297
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:53,550
but still, we have to correct the wrong
and reveal whatever ways you've been wronged.

298
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:59,360
To be honest, that's what I've felt the sorriest about.

299
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,010
Yes.

300
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,510
What is he doing here?

301
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,320
He'll get kicked out.

302
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,430
Let's go.

303
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:46,760
It's fine.

304
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,510
I said it's fine.

305
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,950
It doesn't look good to have it be messy.

306
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,750
It's not because of you.

307
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:38,700
Thank you!

308
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,490
I'll leave first.

309
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,050
Bye.

310
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,360
Sorry.

311
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:19,100
♬ I whose thoughts are filled with you ♬

312
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,890
Sorry. Sorry.

313
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:25,260
♬ am waiting only for tomorrow again. ♬

314
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:29,690
♬ For many of my days ♬

315
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:33,830
♬ I wish you would stay ♬

316
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:40,410
♬ Even if the day is not significant ♬

317
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:55,010
- It's tasty, right?
- Yeah.

318
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,770
- I made it.
- I see.

319
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,300
It seemed like you weren't eating much these days.

320
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,190
It's our signature dish, fried squid.

321
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:08,230
- Have some. It's good.
- It looks good.

322
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:11,950
Put it in the sauce and eat it in one bite.

323
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:15,490
Wow, thanks to the school ending early,
I get this treat.

324
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:30,730
Eat a lot. You have to eat the rice ball,
soondae, and fried food, too, okay?

325
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,030
I should eat quickly and go.

326
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,420
Sorry. Sorry.

327
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,870
Oh! You came quick!

328
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:55,010
Teacher!

329
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:58,380
Oh, you said you were going to be late and

330
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:03,900
asked me to fill in for you, but you got here quick.

331
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,310
How about changing your part-time job
to one near the academy?

332
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:12,790
The boss here asked me
to stay till the end of the month, so...

333
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:15,000
Oh, he did?

334
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:26,700
Teacher.
Thank you so much for today. I'm sorry, too.

335
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,290
Why are you saying that?
Embarrassing me...

336
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:35,390
Well, send an SOS in the future, too,
if you need help with anything.

337
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:36,640
Okay.

338
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,800
Soo Bin.

339
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:03,340
I'm having a really hard time today.

340
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:08,530
But I feel energized by coming here.

341
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,600
You're already sleeping.
Sleep well.

342
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,960
I'm not sleeping yet.

343
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,870
How did you...

344
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:33,990
I know.
How? I guess we're on the same wavelength again.

345
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,520
You seem really tired...

346
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,370
No, I'm full of energy.

347
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,780
But why did you come here?

348
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,330
Well, just because.

349
00:31:54,330 --> 00:32:00,370
I was home, but I was bored,
and to get some air since the weather is nice.

350
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,400
Hey, it's blood!

351
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,400
Were you disappointed?
Because I wasn't coming?

352
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:39,570
This is just a book on self-introduction.

353
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:42,650
And this is a collection of best tips on self-introduction.

354
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:46,420
Also, this is a core summary book on the English exam.

355
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:50,470
And this is a common-sense
encyclopedia with 100% targeted info.

356
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:56,690
And this is must-have case notes on interviews.

357
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:58,270
Why would you...

358
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,810
I'll go now.

359
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:03,500
Tea-Teacher, what is all this?

360
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,180
Oh, to be honest, until you open your heart,

361
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,200
I was just going to stand by and wait.

362
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,230
But I don't think that's right no matter how I think about it.

363
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:18,320
I think it's better to wait while helping.

364
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:23,220
We've opened a English study cafe (online group), too,
so I'll send you the material every day. Take a look,

365
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,850
and I'll send you some homework once in a while, too.

366
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:28,060
I'll correct them for you, too.

367
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:31,420
I'm a teacher after all. Teacher Oh.

368
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,190
I'll go, I'll go. You're working, so—

369
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:39,460
Teach!
But this is... burdensome.

370
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,380
No, don't feel burdened.

371
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:45,740
As someone who likes you,
this is the least I should be doing, no?

372
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:52,290
Can't I?
Whether you date me or not, you decide.

373
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,820
I got it.

374
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,040
Yes, I'll go.

375
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,580
You had this thought, right?

376
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:21,260
"He's cool even when his nose is stuffed."

377
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,280
No, I didn't.

378
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:32,120
Oh, if it's better, let's take it out.

379
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:41,910
It's hard, huh?

380
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,150
No.

381
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:48,690
Don't say no.

382
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:09,780
♬ Please don’t say a word ♬

383
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,020
It's nice.

384
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,560
It's comfortable.

385
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,950
♬ Like a journey coming to an end ♬

386
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:21,290
♬ You say ♬

387
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:23,740
♬ Let it run like the river ♬

388
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,310
♬ Wild and without a care ♬

389
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:29,570
♬ Just like the days, ♬

390
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:34,560
♬ we were young and fumbling ♬

391
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,630
Why aren't you saying anything?

392
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,910
♬ Everything ♬

393
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:40,830
Say what?
I just have to be here with you.

394
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:43,320
♬ Let it go by with a flow ♬

395
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,670
♬ Really wish I could stay, ♬

396
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:50,010
♬ but you know me ♬

397
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:52,260
♬ All the moments we shared ♬

398
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,480
Am I doing well?

399
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,580
♬ Are not going anywhere ♬

400
00:35:56,580 --> 00:36:00,760
♬ Never quite understood it ♬

401
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,310
I'm proud of you.

402
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:05,080
I'm so proud of you, Student Choi Joon Woo.

403
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,230
It might be hard now,

404
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:12,880
but once it passes, won't it get better?

405
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:20,330
It should be better, right?

406
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:26,820
Well, the grown-ups say that it will get better.

407
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,720
I don't know either.

408
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:34,710
But, when it's hard, let's think good thoughts.

409
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:39,920
Get into an art college you
want and do what you've dreamed of.

410
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:44,970
And you beside me.

411
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:53,300
I'm happy now, too.

412
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:58,710
Me too.

413
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,940
Next, Hui Yeong.

414
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,520
Next, Joon Woo.

415
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,130
Yes.

416
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,090
36th?

417
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:38,890
Is Jo Sang Hoon going to be first?

418
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:41,120
Oh, Soo Bin.

419
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:48,320
Hui Yeong, you're okay, right?

420
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,520
Then check your grades, and if you have any questions,

421
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,190
come and discuss it with me, okay?

422
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:56,610
Yes!

423
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:06,980
You're Pil Sang who has scored within the top 200!

424
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,690
So cool!

425
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:10,900
So good!

426
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,040
You'll be watching a movie now!

427
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,350
- Ro Mi, I'm 200th place.
- Huh? Wow.

428
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:16,990
Pil Sang!

429
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:19,670
Ro Mi, I thought I was 500th, but I'm 200th.

430
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:22,490
- Yoo Pil Sang, go away.
- Huh?

431
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:25,770
It's your fault! It's all your fault!

432
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,970
Pil Sang, you're 200th?

433
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:32,270
Teach, I'm going to see a movie with Ro Mi.

434
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:34,070
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

435
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:38,460
Ro Mi, you can bring it up next time.
You have the summer break, too.

436
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:41,070
Next time when?

437
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:46,070
Kids, look up at the sky.

438
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:51,260
The sky is blue and you're fresh
and green at the age of 18.

439
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,340
You have many opportunities, okay?

440
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,230
Fighting!

441
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:56,980
Pil Sang, congrats.

442
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:59,900
- Ro Mi—
- I don't want to.

443
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:04,750
Ro-Ro Mi, Ro Mi, Ro Mi!

444
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:08,030
I miss my mom.

445
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:10,240
Stop it.

446
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,390
I will.

447
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,170
Did you see?

448
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:18,760
Because of you, it went up.
It did go up since I concentrated only on my studies.

449
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,020
Joon Woo.

450
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:31,690
It went up.
You went up, too, right?

451
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:33,970
Yeah, a little.

452
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:39,290
You went up a lot. Wow!

453
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:41,930
Congrats!

454
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:46,800
Oh right,
we shouldn't have met up like that yesterday.

455
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,670
I did it without realizing.

456
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:55,380
It's okay.
At least in the blind spot, let's get some breathing room.

457
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,500
Blind spot?

458
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,930
Even if it's just at school.

459
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:17,410
What is it?

460
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:22,100
I looked at Teacher Han Gyeol's suggestion and...

461
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:31,070
Here, if I win a prize,
I can get a rolling admission as a special talent.

462
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,070
Oh, you can! Hey!

463
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:38,550
It makes me so excited!
I think you'll do well.

464
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:45,020
Since I started late, I'm going to try to concentrate.

465
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:54,380
I have to find my path, too, but I'm still lost.

466
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:59,790
It'll turn out well.

467
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,430
You'll find your path soon.

468
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,090
It'll turn out well.

469
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:12,040
Yoo Soo Bin will do well.

470
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,750
What is it? A spell?

471
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:17,660
Oh, Sang Hoon!
You're finally first in your grade!

472
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,790
I need pointers.

473
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:19,880
Don't go overboard.

474
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,440
The real genius is getting recognized finally.

475
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,690
Don't you think, Ma Hui Yeong?

476
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:34,500
Let's go study!
Let's all go in now. Go in.

477
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:42,810
It turned out to be my dad who sent the email and reported it.

478
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:46,850
I'm sorry that it turned out this way.

479
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:49,790
It wasn't my intention to do this.

480
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,590
Are you okay?

481
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:54,380
Worry about yourself.

482
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,120
Right! Right!
As always, this is what makes you Ma Hui Yeong.

483
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,080
It's a relief.

484
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:06,590
Your strong mentality that never gets crushed.
I'll follow by example.

485
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:12,340
I apologize for what my parents did to you and your dad.

486
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:18,780
But you and your family received enough compensation for it.

487
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,750
Then isn't that enough?

488
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,630
Let's see.

489
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:31,100
How that thick-faced attitude till the end...
Wow, that pride of yours.

490
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,040
I completely acknowledge it.

491
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:37,420
But Hui Yeong, it's not much fun.

492
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:42,340
Competing together at the top level
alongside each other

493
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:45,370
makes it more fun to study.

494
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:49,510
Who am I going to compete with now?

495
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:55,750
Now, our country is driven by export policy that—

496
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:56,630
What's that?

497
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:57,920
Please be quiet.

498
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,150
Who are those people?

499
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:01,910
I think they're scary people.

500
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:04,490
- Pil Sang.
- Pardon?

501
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:06,370
Be quiet I said.

502
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:08,070
Teach, I'm going to see a movie with Ro Mi.

503
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:09,800
Really? Stand straight.

504
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,240
In a short time,
it went from light industry to heavy industry

505
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:17,230
and advanced into high-tech industry.

506
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:21,750
During this process,
industrial facilities were built near metropolitan areas

507
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:23,480
where the growth potential was high...

508
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,760
It pours out, bumps into rocks, and fights fiercely.

509
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:42,660
Hello. We're from the Board of Education.

510
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,930
Yes. You're here.

511
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:46,790
Can we get started?

512
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,780
Yes, let's start.

513
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,880
- Teacher Oh Han Gyeol.
- Yes.

514
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,820
The allegation pertaining
to student Ma Hui Yeong's grade tampering,

515
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:04,920
we'll start the audit with the former homeroom teacher
Kim Byeong Cheol's testimony as the basis.

516
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:11,360
During the investigation, there will be an additional investigation on school violence and the school's handling of the incident.

517
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:15,760
This also is related to student Ma Hui Yeong.

518
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,540
Also, during this investigation,
there's a student we need to speak with.

519
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:22,960
It's Ma Hui Yeong who's under suspicion as well as Lee Gi Tae.

520
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,000
And lastly, Choi Joon Woo.

521
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:28,560
Yes.

522
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:33,890
I'll tell you only the facts within the knowledge
I have of this incident.

523
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:42,650
But... for Hui Yeong, too, please take
into consideration that they are still students.

524
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:46,980
I ask that you be considerate and take care not to scar them.

525
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,540
Please.

526
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:51,380
Maybe it has to do with those people earlier?

527
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:54,760
What is it So Ye?
You know something?

528
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,740
Gi Tae went, too?

529
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:06,250
It's true that Hui Yeong asked me to,
but paying them was my idea.

530
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:12,760
They asked for money anyway,
and I wanted to look good to Hui Yeong, too.

531
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:23,240
I told them the truth.
So that I won't be ashamed in front of you.

532
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:26,840
Also, I asked for forgiveness to Choi Joon Woo, too.

533
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:31,100
You did well.
You did well, Gi Tae.

534
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:34,510
As a homeroom teacher, I'll be investigated, too.

535
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:40,660
I'm going to tell them the truth even if
during that process you become disappointed.

536
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:42,250
I know.

537
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:47,320
I'm ready for it.
You have to tell the truth.

538
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:51,820
I believe this is going to help you.

539
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:53,480
Yes.

540
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:01,220
Joon Woo, come to the counseling office.

541
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:15,250
Other than the allegation of grade tampering,
could you confirm

542
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:18,990
whether the facts are true or not
surrounding Ma Hui Yeong?

543
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,710
Yes.

544
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:32,160
Is this information about Ma Hui Yeong true?

545
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,960
Choi Joon Woo?

546
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:47,000
I wasn't sure about Ma Hui Yeong,
but I didn't think he'd do that.

547
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,840
I'm shocked about grade tampering, but he did that, too?

548
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:55,150
Yoon So Ye, why didn't you say anything?

549
00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:02,070
You should have told me everything.
I didn't know Joon Woo went through all that.

550
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:06,520
Sorry. At that time,
I was afraid of making it become a big deal.

551
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,410
I'm sure she had her reasons, too.

552
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,810
Soo Bin!

553
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:09,300
Why didn't you tell me while going through all that?

554
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:13,790
I knew you'd feel this hurt.

555
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:16,010
How could I tell you?

556
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:23,230
How did you go through all that alone?

557
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:25,390
I didn't even know.

558
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:30,630
Why didn't I try to know?

559
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:52,000
Soo Bin.

560
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:57,870
Hui Yeong was your childhood friend.

561
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:02,930
And I'm sure you didn't want him to be that type of person.

562
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:10,350
You don't need to be sorry.
I understand you.

563
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:12,880
Don't be hurt.

564
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:21,960
This incident... I'll go where my heart takes me.

565
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,190
Joon Woo.

566
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:32,360
How did you deal with it all this time?

567
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:42,850
Well. Because I have you.

568
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,900
Joon Woo.

569
00:49:54,410 --> 00:49:58,590
It'll pass.
These hurtful moments, too.

570
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:05,730
Let's... get through it well.

571
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:23,210
The decision will be made
on the punishment for grade tampering.

572
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:24,650
Yes.

573
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:29,770
You're also acknowledging the incident
involving Choi Joon Woo, too, right?

574
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:31,510
Yes.

575
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:35,290
He must have acknowledged it, too.

576
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:37,910
He postponed giving his answer.

577
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:47,940
Joon Woo!

578
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,390
Go in my car.

579
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:08,250
Earlier... I realized all of a sudden...

580
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:12,940
that I haven't forgiven Hui Yeong.

581
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:20,210
Deep in my heart, I really disliked him.

582
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:26,430
You bore it well all this time.

583
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:31,990
But why did you postpone your answer?

584
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:35,900
You could have told them everything earlier.

585
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:38,690
You held back, didn't you?

586
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:44,070
That's why I dislike myself that much more.

587
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,610
What my feelings are...

588
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:53,660
It's someone I disliked that much.

589
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:57,400
I can't forgive him, even now.

590
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:07,130
What it means that I couldn't tell them right away...

591
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:09,400
I felt stupid, too.

592
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:16,330
What do you mean?
It's because you're a good person.

593
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:19,720
Even with his anger and resentment,

594
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:25,120
the kind of person who hesitates
because it could hurt someone.

595
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:32,800
Joon Woo.

596
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:39,100
You just have to act in the way you believe is right.

597
00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:49,690
♬ I always am happy ♬

598
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:57,520
♬ The time which is recalled like a picture ♬

599
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:04,200
♬ will be stored away so that they will ♬

600
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:11,240
♬ not fade away not fade away ♬

601
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:19,950
♬ Certain days and nights are recalled ♬

602
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:26,500
♬ and nights are recalled ♬

603
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:29,860
♬ Now the feelings ♬

604
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:31,410
Why did you do that?

605
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:33,960
♬ too like understanding everything ♬

606
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,520
I have nothing I can say to you.

607
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,630
♬ I can ♬

608
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:41,010
You were the closest friend to me since we were little.

609
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:46,900
I can't believe that you did something like that.

610
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,960
I'm a bad person by nature.

611
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,050
You know what?

612
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:57,780
What hurts me the most right now
is that while saying you're my closest friend,

613
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:01,090
I didn't know a thing about it until now.

614
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:08,790
Until you turned out like this, that I left you alone.

615
00:54:09,590 --> 00:54:11,700
I'm sorry, Soo Bin.

616
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:17,450
Maybe I... since some time ago,

617
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:20,670
I could have felt it.

618
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:26,380
I might not have been sure,
but that you wouldn't be that kind of a person...

619
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,330
while hoping you weren't.

620
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:36,630
I could have been afraid to know the truth.

621
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:39,250
That's what I regret the most and hurts me the most.

622
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:44,640
No. You were a good friend to me.

623
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,220
I'm leaving.

624
00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:13,920
I'm back.

625
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:18,050
You went to the academy?

626
00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:20,790
I need some water.

627
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:22,510
Okay.

628
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,300
Soo Bin.

629
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:38,450
Is it true about Hui Yeong?
And about Joon Woo, too?

630
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:56,820
You know how, right?

631
00:55:56,820 --> 00:56:01,630
That Joon Woo is not a bad person.
That he's good.

632
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:14,840
Mom.

633
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:23,660
As you said, my grades got better and
I proved that I can do well on my own,

634
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:26,130
so can't you trust me from now on?

635
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:30,820
S-Soo Bin, I trust you.

636
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:37,720
But it's such an important time right now.

637
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:47,260
Also, Soo Bin,
even if you think you can do well on your own,

638
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:50,160
at your age, it's not like that.

639
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:53,570
Which way you'll go, you don't even know yourself.

640
00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:57,700
Please trust me for now.
Unconditionally,

641
00:56:58,610 --> 00:57:02,830
without any imagination or assumption.

642
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,140
Nothing bad will happen to me. Never.

643
00:57:08,850 --> 00:57:16,930
Joon Woo, too, his grades went up a lot
and he worked really hard.

644
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:20,960
He's looking for what he wants to do,

645
00:57:23,930 --> 00:57:26,850
and we made a lot of effort.

646
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:32,270
And we'll keep doing it in the future.

647
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:35,840
I'm just telling you.

648
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,900
I'll go in.

649
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:02,020
Soo Bin.

650
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:07,090
I came to go with you.
You always come and get me.

651
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:11,890
It's okay. Let's go.

652
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:23,520
Please speak comfortably.

653
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,180
Yes.

654
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:37,010
As far as I'm concerned,
I won't give any more testimony.

655
00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:48,100
Please investigate only from what Ma Hui Yeong has said.

656
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:57,130
Joon Woo.

657
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,920
Soo Bin, I...

658
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:13,690
You don't have to tell me.

659
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:19,490
Whatever you decided, you're right.

660
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:24,130
You did well.

661
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:47,030
Withdrawal Application

662
00:59:49,930 --> 00:59:51,870
Hui Yeong.

663
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:56,070
You want to leave?

664
00:59:58,550 --> 01:00:01,790
I want to leave as soon as possible.

665
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:06,880
Well...

666
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:13,170
First, let's give it some time and think about it.

667
01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:14,910
Hui Yeong, huh?

668
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:28,540
I'll leave.

669
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:34,400
Hui Yeong, this is not a solution.

670
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,640
I'm sorry, Teacher.

671
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:48,250
Choi Joon Woo.

672
01:00:55,570 --> 01:01:00,860
You should have told them everything.
Why didn't you?

673
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:07,690
I don't think I need to explain that to you.

674
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:16,830
I'm going to leave.

675
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:38,020
Ma Hui Yeong!

676
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,250
Leave?
With whose permission?

677
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:50,130
Why? It looks bad?

678
01:01:50,130 --> 01:01:52,190
Because I'm running away when you forgave me?

679
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:54,260
Who forgave you?!

680
01:01:55,210 --> 01:01:58,820
You think me not saying anything was forgiveness?

681
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:02,660
When you didn't even admit your mistakes,
what would I forgive?!

682
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:04,240
What should I do then?

683
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:09,250
I'm saying I'll leave while quitting everything.
This is the best I can do!

684
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:14,780
I'm also so scared and afraid!
What do I have to do?

685
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,630
How can I?

686
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:24,850
Have you ever been genuinely
sorry towards me even once?

687
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:28,510
Really, genuinely?

688
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:37,790
You have never, right?

689
01:02:39,930 --> 01:02:43,130
Only your pride is important to you.

690
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:47,730
Ma Hui Yeong.

691
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:54,070
You didn't receive forgiveness.

692
01:02:55,370 --> 01:03:01,640
You're running away like a coward in that state.

693
01:03:09,430 --> 01:03:11,510
Choi Joon Woo!

694
01:03:25,730 --> 01:03:27,640
I'm sorry.

695
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:38,590
♬ Everywhere I go ♬

696

♬ Cause memories don’t say goodbye ♬
