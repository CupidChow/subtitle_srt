1
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:08,620
I like you.

2
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,500
I said I like you too.

3
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,600
I like you.

4
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,870
Choi Joon Woo.

5
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,560
I like you.

6
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,650
- Ah, it's hot.
- Are you okay?

7
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,400
Why is this?

8
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:09,960
Soo Bin...

9
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,540
Are you alright?

10
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,910
Yeah, I'm feeling better.

11
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,530
What about your test?

12
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,890
I took it here with Choi Joon Woo.

13
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,280
Sorry, I was going to take you to the clinic.

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,950
No, it's okay. If you get even one question
wrong because of me, I won't be able to come to school.

15
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,390
Your mom is going to kill me.

16
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,740
No, what do you mean?

17
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,290
Good work, Joon Woo.
You can leave now.

18
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,230
- Nurse! His hand...
- Her hand...

19
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:28,150
Episode 7
Romeo and Juliet

20
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,930
Oh, sorry.

21
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,760
Mom.

22
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,980
Hello, Mother.
She was taking her test and all of a sudden she

23
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,530
got stomach cramps.

24
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,160
Why, of all times,
does it have to be during the math test? Why?

25
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,610
She must've lost time getting here.
Could she have focused on doing the test here?

26
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:23,290
This is a very important test.
Why does it have to be during the math test? What do we do?

27
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:27,450
Hui Yeong, what can I do?
I'm so sorry.

28
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,360
Did you not do the test well because of Soo Bin?

29
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,490
It wasn't me but...

30
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:34,800
That student carried Soo Bin here.

31
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,400
Oh, thank you.

32
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,830
Did you come here after finishing your test?

33
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,800
Good, good, you need to finish your test.
You did well.

34
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,680
Hello.

35
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,440
Are you okay, Soo Bin?

36
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,930
I couldn't even come because I was proctoring.

37
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,190
- Oh, Soo Bin's mother, you came.
- Yes, hello.

38
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,440
Teacher, what do we do?

39
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,710
I'm not sure.

40
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:08,820
What do we do about the time she took to get here?
It's not like she got sick because she wanted to get sick.

41
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,300
That should be taken into consideration.
She was taking a test.

42
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,730
Could she have focused?

43
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,240
This is making me crazy.
This was such an important test.

44
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:21,540
- I'll make sure there's no disadvantage.
- Are there rules for something like this?

45
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,890
I'm not sure...
I'm going to have to review—

46
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,050
- You said there would be no disadvantage—
- Let's go out first.

47
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,350
Did you focus?
I don't think so.

48
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,100
She probably couldn't have focused.
What can we do about that?

49
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,860
What do we do when the test is finished.

50
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,170
I got it, Yoo Soo Bin.

51
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,860
You're fine, where would it have hurt?

52
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,290
Yes, why don't we finish talking outside?

53
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,330
Teacher, talk more outside.

54
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,510
You already seemed to have got
an appointment for a checkup?

55
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,960
Oh, yes.

56
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,040
My alumni from Seoul National University runs the clinic.

57
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,950
I wish that she could check her answers
for the math test before we leave.

58
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:13,160
Ah, oh, you don't have to worry about that.
When the answers come out, I'll send them to you.

59
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,770
I'm going to check the answers right now.

60
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:18,150
Oh, right, we have Hui Yeong here with us.

61
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,820
He always gets 100%, you can check the answers.

62
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:37,760
Hey Yoo Soo Bin!
Are you alright?

63
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,700
I was worried.

64
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:44,050
No wonder.
It was odd that the moon card was always getting picked.

65
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:49,070
- When there is a bad feeling, this card comes out.
- Here we go again.

66
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,720
She talks like she's such an expert, doesn't she?

67
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,670
Get it right before the event happens.

68
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:58,590
Hey, let's go!

69
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:04,480
Let's check the math answers before cleaning.
I'll explain in more detail during the study group.

70
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,930
Look at the class president being so diligent,
what's the rush?

71
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,860
Yeah, we should do it now.

72
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,670
Okay, let's see. The first question was easy right?
It was the number, three.

73
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,860
Oh, I got it wrong.

74
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:21,160
The second question is three.

75
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,420
- Three?
- Question number three is four.

76
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,280
Oh.

77
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,800
- What is question 3?
- Four.

78
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,480
I'll show you.

79
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,900
What number?
What number?

80
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,490
Question four is one.

81
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,150
Question five is two.
Next...

82
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:39,130
Teacher, I think I've seen the kid who carried Soo Bin before.

83
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:42,250
Oh, his name is Joon Woo and he recently transferred.

84
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,990
The one who was was forcibly transferred right?

85
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,190
I mean, i-it's

86
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:49,930
just a regular transfer.

87
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,590
Joon Woo, where are you going?

88
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,720
Aren't you going to check your answers?

89
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,980
I'm on duty.

90
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,580
Why is this kind of kid carrying Soo Bin when we have you?

91
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,490
I was proctoring in a different room.

92
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:18,240
Teacher, this can't happen. She can't be seen with him.
She was tied with him at the random pairing too.

93
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,670
- Joon Woo is not a bad kid.
- You said he was forcibly transferred.

94
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,300
Teacher, please keep that in mind.

95
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,200
Yes, I got it.

96
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,330
I did as well as I expected.
Yoo Soo Bin looks fine, let's go to a noraebang.

97
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,300
Noraebang?
Sounds good. I did better than last time.

98
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,820
I got roughly the same thing.
I don't like math.

99
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,400
Yoo Soo Bin!

100
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,230
Did you get question 15 right?

101
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,200
No, I put number one.

102
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,830
Shut up, how many did you get wrong?

103
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,320
What the heck, Yoo Soo Bin did way better than you.

104
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,250
Hwang Ro Mi, what's this fuss about?

105
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:07,430
Yoo Soo Bin was qualified, why did I fail?

106
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,070
I'm dizzy.

107
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,990
She even went to Son Jae Yeong's class.
They probably gave her the answers.

108
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,370
All these questions are so dumb.

109
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,130
Hey Ro Mi.

110
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,490
Can you say that sort of thing to a sick person?

111
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,870
Hey, Moon Chan Yeol.

112
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,270
Ahh, seriously.

113
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:26,760
- Watch you mouth.
- Mind your own buisness.

114
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,200
That student was the one who carried Soo Bin.

115
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,520
Oh, thank you.

116
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,890
You got this wrong.
You got a question this easy wrong?

117
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:16,090
Hey, even I would get that right.

118
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,260
How are you going to get first like this?
First place is gone now.

119
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:23,710
Why did you quit Mr. Son's math class?
What makes you so confident?

120
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:27,290
You were more worried about my test than about my pain.

121
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:31,340
You can get better with medicine
it's not like you got a terminal illness.

122
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,040
You've got a glass-like mentality.

123
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,200
With that mentality, how are you going
to survive in this battlefield?

124
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,060
I'm sorry I have a glass-like mentality.

125
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,680
Hey, I heard the kid who carried you was that troublemaker.

126
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,070
Choi Joon Woo is not a troublemaker.

127
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,410
Whatever he is, he's still the guy that got forcibly transferred.

128
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,880
We saw him, the good looking guy
in front of the academy right?

129
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,410
He was next to that young looking
mom or aunt or whatever with the fake bag.

130
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:59,470
It's him right?
Why would he help you?

131
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,090
Why do you keep getting involved with him?
Do you have something between you?

132
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:06,170
Are you interested in him because he's handsome?
Don't even think about getting involved with him.

133
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:09,780
- No, I'm not.
- Just don't even get close to him.

134
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,000
Just don't get mixed with that guy.

135
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,100
- Don't get close to him.
- It's just because we're in t he same class.

136
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,600
Lower your voice.

137
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,370
Today's math test was a bit hard, right?

138
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:28,890
If it was hard for me, then it means that it's really hard.
So, don't be discouraged.

139
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,710
Yet, he got 100%.

140
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:35,960
Let's do well on the next final exam.
I will help.

141
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,230
Next is, uh, fifteen.

142
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:43,450
Our math teacher set a trap to trick us.

143
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,020
Did you tell our classmates that the answer
to question 15 was four?

144
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,720
How is this number four?

145
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,480
Fifteen?
Problem fifteen is four.

146
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,590
Stay still.

147
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,660
This is not like you Sang Hoon.
Falling into the trap.

148
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:03,320
No, it's you falling into the trap.

149
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,280
If you do this... stay still.

150
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,180
T squared is... 9t... minus k...

151
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,220
T is tripled,

152
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,510
and k is 0.

153
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:18,220
This is exactly where you fell straight into the trap.

154
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,150
You went straight down.

155
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:27,060
So, K is included in 0.

156
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,060
So, it's two.

157
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,320
Stupid, stupid.

158
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,430
Teacher, please solve a problem for me.

159
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm almost there, I'll call you when I get to the academy.

160
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,480
No, solve it right now.
Now, right now.

161
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,030
I'm driving...

162
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,220
I'll stop for your passion for math.

163
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,960
You teacher twisted the problem
so you guys fall in the trap.

164
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:05,230
There may be different answers
for how you solved the problem

165
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,140
So what is the answer?

166
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,550
Alright, one second.

167
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,500
The answer is two.

168
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,610
Are you sure?

169
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,880
It's a bit out of line if you ask me that.

170
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,070
If t is a positive number greater than zero...

171
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:36,170
Then, it won't be finished in the first half.
Which is delayed?

172
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,700
Yeah.

173
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:47,900
Then, I'll participate in the training this time.

174
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,310
I said I like you, too.

175
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,860
I like you.

176
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,170
How can he not do anything after confessing?

177
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:01,200
Was that by chance not reality?

178
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,460
That's so strange.
Why does it seem so unrealistic?

179
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,010
It's done.

180
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,900
Student?

181
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,980
So she doesn't have a specific type of illness, right?

182
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,830
It could just be stress.

183
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,870
Stop harassing your daughter so much, Sunbae.

184
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:21,300
What do you mean harassing?
She's just sensitive. Wait a minute.

185
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,920
Yes, Director.

186
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,720
Your mom, wow...

187
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:31,080
She's a little hard right?
She was famous for that in school too.

188
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,930
Doctor.

189
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:40,200
If you're sick... hallucinations...

190
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,140
Delusions?
Can those symptoms occur?

191
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,790
Rest for today.

192
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:53,180
Since you couldn't keep your promise to me to
be number one, you have to listen to me now, okay?

193
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:57,920
I have to go back to work.
I have a ton to do.

194
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,150
Eat the porridge.

195
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,460
Okay.

196
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,630
Thanks, Mom.

197
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,690
If you get a lot of stress since
your mentality isn't stable,

198
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,920
it is possible for you to experience those.

199
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:34,330
Something you had hoped for could happen
in your imagination and you think it's reality.

200
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:38,050
So that thing.

201
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,520
I did hope for that to happen?

202
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:51,600
You're heavy. When I was carrying you earlier,
you were extremely heavy.

203
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,910
I thought my back was going to break.

204
00:14:54,930 --> 00:15:00,360
That's right... They say people see
what they want and hear what they want.

205
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,200
Is it self-justification?

206
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,390
What am I going to do? If I feel embarrassment,
do I make excuses for myself?

207
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:09,800
No no no.
Then what about this?

208
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,820
- Hot!
- Are you okay?

209
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,030
What is this?!

210
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:20,150
Why is it completely fine?
What am I going to do?

211
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:29,190
Soo Bin, are you home?

212
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:33,440
If you're all healed up,
you should come to our crazy after-exam party.

213
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,600
Oh my gosh, I went too hard.

214
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,390
My body isn't the same as before.

215
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,420
Yoo Soo Bin, what's up with you?

216
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,870
Is it because you didn't get first place in math?

217
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:49,300
Just hang on to it.

218
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:54,090
- Did Oh Je leave?
- Yeah.

219
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,360
He has to help out in his dad's snack shop.

220
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,100
I'm going to go to the bathroom really quick.

221
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,640
Yoon So Ye.

222
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,980
You're going again?

223
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:07,520
Who would believe that this pretty girl
has bowel problems?

224
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,110
Who cares?

225
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:18,300
Soo Bin. Are you really sick?
Do you want me to take you home?

226
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,200
Harder, harder!

227
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,480
Over there too.
And here.

228
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:34,130
You know your mom was a nuisance

229
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:37,440
to our work because she did your work.

230
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,430
You know, right?

231
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:43,520
Since she's older I couldn't say anything
and I had to clean everything up.

232
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,960
I had to carry all the heavy packages.

233
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,800
My arm still hurts.

234
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,320
My mom worked hard too.
Her legs were swollen.

235
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,360
She even used two packs of pain relief patches.

236
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,490
This punk.

237
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,490
So are you complaining? Huh? Huh?

238
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:04,570
I can't do this with you. I'm going to tell our boss
about all the wrong things you've done.

239
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:07,130
I'm going to call him and tell him.

240
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:08,700
I'm sorry.

241
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,730
I'll clean out the back, too.

242
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,600
I guess you have a conscience.

243
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,890
Eat first and do it.
You're going to use your strength.

244
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:51,200
There is not one day you don't injure yourself.

245
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,940
That's an issue.

246
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:05,000
Should I have called Yoo Soo Bin?

247
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:09,770
What now?
Why are you so frozen?

248
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,820
Are you touched because of the triangle kimbap?

249
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:19,030
- You're so innocent.
- Excuse me.

250
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,860
If...

251
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:27,220
If you tell someone you like them...

252
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,740
You?

253
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,860
Who is it? Who?

254
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,100
No, it's not me.

255
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,000
It's someone in my class.
His name is Oh Je.

256
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,160
He...

257
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,230
told me he

258
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,760
doesn't know what to do next after saying he likes her.

259
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,280
What do you mean he doesn't know what to do?
It's obvious.

260
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,410
Obvious? How?

261
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,930
He said he liked her.

262
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:59,390
The step after that...

263
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,840
is a kiss.

264
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:06,700
- He said he likes you?
- To you?
- Who?

265
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,770
- Ma Hui Yeong?
- Is Ma Hui Yeong crazy? Why would he say that?

266
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:15,020
No not me.
One of my friends from middle school.

267
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,230
From middle school? Who?

268
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,440
Min Seo? Yoo Ri?

269
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,270
You don't know her.

270
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:26,770
Either way, she said someone confessed to her.

271
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:32,280
But since then, the guy hasn't called her or anything.

272
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,270
They didn't make plans to meet again?

273
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,100
Yeah.

274
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:41,170
But on that day, he was busy

275
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:45,490
- at school.
- What about texts?

276
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,330
But!

277
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:53,470
I heard that the guy is just a busy person.

278
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,950
Even if he's busy, that's a bit much.

279
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,340
It's the first day of confessing.

280
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,680
That's true. It's day one starting today.

281
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,950
Day one starting today?

282
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:06,970
Yeah. I ate pasta with Oh Je the first day I confessed to him.

283
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,530
Over there, at the mall.

284
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:12,410
I miss Oh Je again.

285
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:19,100
That's you, right?

286
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,530
What?!

287
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:22,100
No!

288
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,610
- I think it's you.
- It's not!

289
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,690
It is you!

290
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,220
I said It's not!

291
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:33,210
I'm joking. There's no way it's you.

292
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:38,700
What is Ro Mi doing?
She's not even coming to noraebang.

293
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:44,030
She said she's going to the spa with her mom.
Luxury hotel spa.

294
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:47,330
There's no way it's me.

295
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,160
Hey Ro Mi, where are you?

296
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,780
I'm going to eat dinner after the spa with my mom.

297
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,010
You guys just go.

298
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,540
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

299
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,600
How much is it?

300
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,630
$2,500 per month.

301
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:14,660
It's that expensive?

302
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:18,280
It's because it's 1:1 tutoring with consulting.

303
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,120
Do you want to sign up?

304
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,630
After I look around a little more.

305
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,300
Why is it so expensive?

306
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:32,270
Dad.

307
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,450
Why aren't you picking me up?

308
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:38,090
Ro Mi what am I going to do?
I have to go to the countryside with the hospital chief.

309
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,670
I'm sorry.

310
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,210
What is he saying?

311
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:09,900
Hwi Yeong, you haven't gone home yet?

312
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,900
Oh, that math problem?

313
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,160
I heard from the math teacher, hm?

314
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,690
It's just one problem, so don't let it get to you.

315
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:22,320
Now that the test is done, let's go home and get some rest.

316
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,240
One problem?

317
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:28,550
My life may change over that one problem.

318
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:31,060
Just one problem.

319
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:35,760
Hey man, stop overreacting.

320
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,920
What do you mean your life can change?
It's because you have that way of thinking

321
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,440
that your arm doesn't heal.

322
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:46,140
You should know how to let things go for a change.

323
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:49,420
If you continue to obsess over something like this,
you won't get anything done.

324
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,010
What do you know?

325
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:58,210
You didn't graduate from Seoul National University
nor did you graduate in Seoul.

326
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,280
What do you know?

327
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,790
Hui Yeong, Ma Hui... Hey!

328
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:17,510
That punk really has no manners.

329
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,720
Hey, Ma Hui Yeong!

330
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,950
Where are you? Come home quickly.

331
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:35,760
We need to come up with a plan for your math score.

332
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,130
All you think about is what happened
which is making you more confused.

333
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,870
I should go check if it's real or not.

334
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:51,590
Go.

335
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,280
Good work today.

336
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,010
It's not over because you confessed.

337
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:11,900
You should either kiss her in celebration,
or if that's hard,

338
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:15,180
just keep texting her.

339
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,660
To confirm things.

340
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:22,540
"Hey, what I just said, I really mean it."

341
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:26,620
"It's day one starting today, okay?"

342
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,300
Something like this.

343
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:33,700
For the girl, after receiving a confession,
everything feels out of this world.

344
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,950
"Is this real?
Could it be a dream?"

345
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:40,360
She becomes very confused.

346
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,670
She literally loses her mind.

347
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:47,210
Yoo Soo Bin, about what I said earlier...

348
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,710
Yoo Soo Bin, are you feeling better?

349
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,990
No, let's just be direct.

350
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:01,530
Yoo Soo Bin, what I said to you at the nurse's office earlier...

351
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,950
I heard the bike's name is Beom Bi.

352
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,150
Hi.

353
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:19,700
Give me a ride on Beom Bi.
I feel terrible today.

354
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,750
I have a flat tire in the back
so you can't ride it properly, sorry.

355
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,460
Sorry, I'm going to leave.

356
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:32,240
Can I borrow your bus card?
I left my wallet at school.

357
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,350
That doesn't work.

358
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,430
Choi Joon Woo, I am curious about something.

359
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,500
- The person you like, is it me or Yoo Soo Bin?
- What?

360
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:54,020
I think that you like me, and my friends think so too.

361
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,540
But looking back, it looked as
if you were more interested in Yoo Soo Bin.

362
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:01,780
Is it because I ignore you?
Is it like 'something is better than nothing?'

363
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:08,060
Idiot, do you think it's that easy to date
the queen of Cheonbong High?

364
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,290
Uhm, Moon Chan Yeol.

365
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:13,450
It's Hwang Ro Mi. The jokes are pretty lame.

366
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:17,910
- Let me make it clear, I—
- Hwang Ro Mi.

367
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,920
The bus is here.

368
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:41,920
Whenever Joon Woo sees me, he always blushes.

369
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,080
It's cute.

370
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,700
She said that. How could I forget?

371
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,260
- Sir, one person.
- Two people.

372
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,550
- No, just one person.
- Two people.

373
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,870
Just get in quickly.

374
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,630
I'm getting off.

375
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,680
I'm leaving now.

376
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,510
Sir, I'm sorry, but I'm getting off here.

377
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,640
Good bye.

378
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,450
Choi Joon Woo!

379
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,040
What's with her?

380
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:39,400
Darn it, Joon Woo...

381
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:55,140
What do you know?
You didn't graduate from Seoul National University

382
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,090
nor did you graduate in Seoul.

383
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:58,870
What do you know?

384
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,040
I'm hearing the same thing my mom
told me ten years ago.

385
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:11,220
No way, Mom, are you possessing him?

386
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,900
Is that right, Mom?

387
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:21,050
Of all cases, you're possessing Ma Hui Yeong's body.

388
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:34,530
Still, I miss you, Mom.

389
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:48,240
I wasn't even able to date once.

390
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,210
Why are you giving him advice?

391
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,430
Thank you for applying for the NY Corporation. We are sad to say that you did not pass the interview. We wish you good luck. /i>

392
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:01,850
You've failed another interview once again.

393
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:08,650
Nice one, nice job.

394
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:13,560
I'm getting a runny nose.

395
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,530
Dang it.

396
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,990
I'm already feeling depressed,

397
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:21,490
Why do you have to be crying so obnoxiously?

398
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:25,100
Excuse me sir, if you're going to keep crying,

399
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,950
go out and cry.

400
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:30,730
- Ahjussi?
- I'm not crying.

401
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:35,730
I'm more sad than you, so go outside and cry.

402
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:40,780
You know I want to cry more than you?

403
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,200
Anyway, I should find out even though
I may get a harsh reality check.

404
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,660
Why?

405
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:55,640
Because I hate situations like this.
I should get this sorted out quickly

406
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,660
and focus on studying.

407
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:01,030
Who cares if it's just my imagination?

408
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:04,390
What, are you going to get a fine or get points deducted?

409
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:07,970
I am a confident Yoo Soo Bin.

410
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:10,760
I am worldly Yoo Soo Bin.

411
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,220
This is really hard.

412
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,700
Choi Joon Woo

413
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,470
It's okay.

414
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:47,560
It's okay?

415
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:05,150
H-Hello.

416
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:07,120
Hello.

417
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,810
Choi Joon Woo?

418
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:11,970
Yoo Soo Bin?

419
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:15,710
Well... it's Yoo Soo Bin.

420
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,890
Choi Joon Woo?

421
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,760
Do you hear me?

422
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,350
What the?

423
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:28,270
Hello?

424
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:36,630
Did he just hang up on me?

425
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,840
What is this. It ended.

426
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,600
It's all messed up, it's all messed up.

427
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:57,310
Since the day hasn't ended,

428
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:10,310
why haven't I thought of this before?

429
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,110
Login verification.
Enter the code in your text message.

430
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,190
That's right!

431
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,440
But where is her house?

432
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:55,430
Choi Joon Woo what is this?

433
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:58,470
What do you even know?

434
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:01,370
The timing isn't right.

435
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,870
I shouldn't have brought it up today.

436
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:08,300
You had tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.

437
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:11,100
Today wasn't the only day.

438
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,570
Jeong Oh Je, that jerk.

439
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:21,040
He only contacts me when he wants to.

440
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,400
Are we really dating?

441
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:28,270
Don't be so clingy, Kwon Da Huin.

442
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:30,930
Guys get sick of that quickly.

443
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:36,410
What did I do?
Shouldn't all girlfriends do this?

444
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,700
Jeong Oh Je!
Let's talk.

445
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,480
What do you want to talk about?

446
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,530
Gosh.

447
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:47,750
You said you'd call but you never did.

448
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:50,450
Oh, yesterday something came up.

449
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:51,560
What was it?

450
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,150
You know, at the snack bar.

451
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,480
You didn't work yesterday.

452
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:58,500
No, I did. I had to work.

453
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:10,610
Yesterday I—

454
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:13,270
Thanks for taking me to the Nurse's office yesterday.

455
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:17,210
And I called you last night.

456
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,830
Why?

457
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:22,620
I thought about it and realized that
I never thanked you properly.

458
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,440
And I was sorry that maybe
you ruined your test because of me.

459
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,250
I called you and it was clearly ringing,
but you see, I couldn't hear anything.

460
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:33,250
It's okay though because sometimes
you can't hear anything even when it's connected.

461
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,600
It happens sometimes.

462
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,280
Anyway, thank you and I'm sorry.
Thank you.

463
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,030
Goodbye.

464
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:44,820
So, she called me yesterday.

465
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:50,260
You sure are an outcast.
Not even one person called you last night.

466
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:55,400
Ah, you did get one call though.

467
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,670
Who's 'I'm okay'?

468
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:00,180
I picked up but didn't hear anything.

469
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,590
Switch out your trash phone.

470
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:05,470
Why is nothing working out for me?

471
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:08,420
As if the entire universe is against me.

472
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:12,840
- Soo Bin.
- Oh, hello! Did you finish your homework?

473
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:16,980
You thought you lost your phone right?
You dummy.

474
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,160
Hey, no it's not, no it's not.

475
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:23,820
Look at her all happy,
after ignoring my confession yesterday.

476
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,970
It's weird no matter how I see it.

477
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:46,230
Don't tell me that my Ro Mi
has a crush on that new transfer punk.

478
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:48,820
There's no way.

479
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,750
It's possible.

480
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:58,720
Anyway, once more,
so there are no weird questions like problem 15,

481
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,920
that's why I asked to meet so early in the morning.

482
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,920
Ma'am, it wasn't really a strange question—

483
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:11,360
Our fellow Mr. Park wanted to come up
with more high-end questions

484
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,510
that were more original,

485
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:18,040
which led him to get a bit too ambitious.
That's why—

486
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,090
Yes sir?

487
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:20,590
Ah, Mr. Oh, you're here.

488
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:24,220
This is Hui Yeong's mother.

489
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:28,210
Oh, I've heard a lot about you.
I'm Hui Yeong's new homeroom teacher—

490
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:30,830
Teacher Oh Han Gyeol.

491
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:34,220
Ah, yes. It's nice to meet you.

492
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:40,120
I have a...
Don't take this the wrong way, but advice.

493
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,590
Yes?

494
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:43,790
An open house class?
(Open house -- parents can visit the class in session)

495
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:48,850
We already had one in the beginning of the school year.

496
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,480
Yes, I am aware.

497
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,090
I'd like one especially for the 11th grade, class 3 room.

498
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:56,170
For your English class.

499
00:37:56,170 --> 00:38:00,810
I see.
You'd like to see my competence as a teacher.

500
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:04,820
You're as smart as I thought.

501
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:08,730
I'm afraid I can't do that.

502
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:10,770
As a new homeroom teacher,

503
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:16,800
I am planning to hold a meeting to meet all the parents, but

504
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,050
I don't think I want my skills to be verified like this.

505
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,430
Also, I heard that you put brakes

506
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:41,250
on all of Hui Yeong's plans.

507
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,940
I put on brakes?

508
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:46,290
The former teacher, Mr.Kim,

509
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:49,590
conceded all things involved with studying to Hui Yeong.

510
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:55,220
He went over all his study plans with him,
as far as I know.

511
00:38:55,220 --> 00:39:00,510
That's why class 3 was always at the top.

512
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:06,060
So I'd appreciate if you would actively support

513
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:09,770
my Hui Yeong's study plans.

514
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:18,060
That doesn't make sense.
Why isn't it correct?

515
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:21,590
Sang Hoon, the question itself...

516
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,800
Teacher, if I got that one problem right,
I could've been the top of the class.

517
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,700
Fine, alright, alright.

518
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,830
Let's talk inside.

519
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:34,390
Go safely, Ma'am.

520
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:57,100
Good morning, everyone.

521
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:00,520
Let's start our morning assembly.
Why? Is something good happening?

522
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,110
Hui Yeong is at the top of the class again.

523
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,560
Really?

524
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,450
Congrats, Hui Yeong.

525
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:08,430
Thank you, sir.

526
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:11,580
If it wasn't for question 15, wouldn't Class 1,
Jo Sang Hoon be first?

527
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,130
Probably.

528
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:16,950
Teacher, is it really true that
all answers are correct for question 15?

529
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:19,720
That's what I heard.

530
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,690
Oh, thank goodness.

531
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:25,660
It must've driven Sang Hoon mad.
He was right with problem 15 in the first place.

532
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:30,670
I got it wrong, but thanks to Hui Yeong,
I got it right. Thank you Hui Yeong.

533
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:35,370
Alright, alright, alright, be quiet.

534
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:39,910
There is something that needs to be done
before the morning assembly.

535
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:41,960
The seat has been empty,
we need to elect a class vice president.

536
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,940
What?

537
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,320
What?

538
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,120
Why?

539
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,420
Mr. Oh, no need to worry.
I can handle on my own.

540
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:52,280
Yeah, I can help him too.

541
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:57,040
I appreciate it guys,
I feel reassured because you have my back.

542
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,680
But still, let's pick one.

543
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:03,270
Seeing that Hui Yeong has so much to deal with hurts my heart.

544
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,830
Then what about Gi Tae or Soo Bin—

545
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:13,400
Since we don't have that much time.
First, volunteers and recommendations.

546
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:18,410
Also, it has to be someone who has no role right now.

547
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:19,920
Come on, quickly, quickly.

548
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,670
Alright, volunteers or recommendations.

549
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,860
- Kwon Da Huin.
- Me.

550
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,100
- Yoon So Ye.
- Alright, alright.

551
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:28,400
So Ye, Da Huin.

552
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,500
Alright, volunteers?

553
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,160
Volunteers and recommendations.

554
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:37,270
Me?
No way. I can't do it.

555
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:39,970
Mr. Oh, me!

556
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:44,180
I won't do it.

557
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,650
Just do it, anyone.

558
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:50,990
Alright, alright Pil Sang.
Who else?

559
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:53,480
- Does he have a hidden desire for power?
- No one else?

560
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,150
Alright, alright.
Anyone else who wants Pil Sang as our vice president?

561
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,800
That is not a good idea.

562
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,700
I am against it. Yoon Pil Sang, put your hand down.

563
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:07,810
Unfortunately, everyone is against it, Pil Sang.

564
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:11,810
Alright, who else?

565
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:17,040
Joon Woo, what is it?

566
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,920
I have a recommendation for the vice president.

567
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,330
Not volunteering?

568
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:25,740
Choi Joon Woo, you better not recommend me.

569
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:26,770
Okay then who?

570
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:29,230
I'm sorry but I have no interest at all.

571
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:33,060
Then, I'll just do it.

572
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:38,060
Joon Woo?

573
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:40,480
You will?

574
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,780
You recommend yourself?

575
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,020
I agree.

576
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:50,170
- Me too, I agree.
- Me too.

577
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:53,300
I never would've expected this.

578
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,440
Mr. Oh, he's way better than Yoon Pil Sang.

579
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,130
I approve.

580
00:42:57,130 --> 00:42:58,910
Really, you approve?

581
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,830
He is better than Pil Sang.

582
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:05,300
Alright, Choi Joon Woo for class vice president?

583
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,010
Alright, Choi Joon Woo for class vice president?

584
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:09,280
It has been decided!

585
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,710
Wow, congratulations!

586
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,600
My Joon Woo is class vice president?

587
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,880
Oh yes, and also Joon Woo wanted to do it himself,

588
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,390
so he volunteered for it.

589
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:37,300
Joon Woo is doing well in school,
so don't worry too much, Mother.

590
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:40,300
Yes, Mr. Oh, thank you.

591
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:43,010
Thank you very much.

592
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:50,440
Joon Woo became the class vice president.

593
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:52,950
The class vice president.

594
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,150
Rock, paper, scissors. Rock, paper, scissors.
Rock, paper, scissors.

595
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,050
Choi Joon Woo wins!

596
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:59,450
Choi Joon Woo wins.
Alright, Choi Joon Woo, you pick.

597
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:01,840
I pick Yoo Soo Bin.

598
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:05,890
Alright, Yoo Soo Bin, come on out.

599
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:06,570
I pick Ro mi.

600
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:09,090
Ro Mi, alright, Hwang Ro Mi get behind Hui Yeong.

601
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:10,210
Alright one more.

602
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:11,690
Ready!

603
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,650
Rock, paper, scissors!
Hui Yeong wins!

604
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:15,420
You can attack anyone whether the person is a boy or girl.

605
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,470
Once you're hit, you're out.

606
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:18,390
Yes!

607
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:21,670
First, Team Gi Tae, alright ready!

608
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:23,480
Fighting!

609
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:29,040
Take it.

610
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,110
Hey, what are you two doing?

611
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:45,050
Give it to someone else.

612
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,430
Let's go! Here, Ro Mi.

613
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:57,940
Kwon Da Huin!

614
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:12,050
Hit her, hit her.

615
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:14,080
Run!

616
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:49,690
Choi Joon Woo...

617
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:55,470
Yoo Soo Bin is like a pea. A very small pea.

618
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,570
Choi Joon Woo, you're out!

619
00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:16,920
I can't believe what Choi Joon Woo did.

620
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:20,950
Why does he have to overreact like that to protect you?

621
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:24,250
He probably just wanted to catch the ball.

622
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:30,210
He's the class vice president now.
He's trying to find a new concept for himself.

623
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:37,260
Then again, I really can't believe what this girl does.

624
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:41,300
She attacked you pretending to attack me.

625
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:45,390
Ah, it hurts so much.

626
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:49,670
- Sorry Da Huin.
- Get rid of the halibut.

627
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:51,540
What do you mean halibut?

628
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:54,390
Oh Je was pretty cool back there.

629
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:59,100
I guess.
It's no surprise, as usual.

630
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:07,600
What are you saying?
You're so annoying.

631
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,570
I love you, Da Huin.

632
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,890
Over there, watch out!

633
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,950
Hey!

634
00:47:56,690 --> 00:48:00,390
Do you have a parasite in your body or what?

635
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:03,060
Move over.
We're going to be late.

636
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:05,130
Stop messing around.

637
00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:18,280
Men's changing room

638
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:36,450
I took care of the issue with the math test.

639
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:38,330
How?

640
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:43,740
You reckless fool, you're going
to humiliate your father like this?

641
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:47,270
Why do I have to kiss up for something you do?

642
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:48,960
Why should I?

643
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,810
I apologize.

644
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,510
It's going to end up as being a problematic question.

645
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:59,930
Mr. Cho's son, Cho Sang Hoon ended up
answering it very well.

646
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:05,370
What about you?
I poured in all my hard earned money to tutor you.

647
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:07,840
You're not going to get your head together?

648
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:12,760
Honey, wait, please don't do this.

649
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,450
Hui Yeong worked so hard this time.
Honey, please don't do this.

650
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:16,530
That was him trying his best?

651
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:18,410
- Please, honey, please.
- Are you not going to move?

652
00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:20,130
Move!

653
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:22,480
Mom, go upstairs.

654
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,120
No, please don't.
Hit me instead.

655
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,650
That's right.

656
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:28,260
You are responsible too.

657
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:31,280
I'll teach you both a lesson.

658
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:01,810
Choi Joon Woo.

659
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:06,720
Do you want me to clear your name?

660
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:12,220
About stealing that watch.
I can clear that, yeah?

661
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:19,190
What to do?
You lost that timing.

662
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:23,350
I said I can clear your name.
Do you not want me to?

663
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:28,480
You seem mad at Hui Yeong over that math test.
Take care of it yourselves.

664
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,640
Don't think about using me.

665
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,660
Choi Joon Woo!

666
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,050
Ma Hui Yeong!

667
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:58,630
You cowardly punk.
You used your mom to tempt the math teacher?

668
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:02,800
I could've been first in the class if
I got it right but you fabricated the answer.

669
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,170
What did I fabricate?

670
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:07,240
The teacher admitted himself
that the question itself is wrong.

671
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:10,980
You did worse than me in other categories
which is why you're not first. Why are you blaming me?

672
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:13,280
You're unbelievable.

673
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:18,120
Your family made such a big deal and the teacher
eventually gave way. Did you think I wouldn't know?

674
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:24,180
Did you see it?
Do you have evidence?

675
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:26,900
I said do you have evidence, you punk?

676
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:29,400
What fault would you have?

677
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:33,250
You're just your mom and dad's pet.

678
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:36,170
It's better for me to ask them myself.

679
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:39,360
You just wait, Ma Hui Yeong.

680
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:43,800
I'll fix all this and become first again.

681
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:51,900
Oh, you do have something to be guilty of.
Not having wheels that turn as fast as mine.

682
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:56,200
That punk.

683
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:14,790
What fault would you have?

684
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:18,320
You're just your mom and dad's pet.

685
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:53,020
Of course, I did it.

686
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:55,490
You must be so proud.

687
00:52:57,050 --> 00:53:01,040
Who wants to come over
to Soo Bin's house today and hang out?

688
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,330
Soo Bin, you should come too.

689
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:04,470
I'll bring you along.

690
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:05,880
Let's go eat tteokbokki.

691
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,510
Tteokbokki!

692
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:10,240
Let's eat tteokbokki.

693
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:16,250
Here, I brought your fried squid.

694
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:18,040
Enjoy your food.

695
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:18,950
Thank you.

696
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:21,780
Welcome.
This way, please.

697
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:24,400
Hello, I'm Oh Je's friend.

698
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,520
Our Oh Je's seat partner, Choi Joon Woo?

699
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:33,270
You transferred here and you draw well?

700
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:36,830
It's nice to meet you. I'm Oh Je's dad.

701
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:39,160
You're even better looking than what I've heard.

702
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:42,560
You're almost as handsome as my Oh Je.

703
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:47,940
Hey, Oh Je!

704
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,900
- Joon Woo is here.
- Oh, yes.

705
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:52,160
Oh,

706
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,950
Joon Woo.

707
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:56,910
The baby?

708
00:53:56,910 --> 00:54:00,000
He's my brother, Oh Dong.
He's cute, right?

709
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,660
One second.
I'll get you some tteokbokki and fries.

710
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:04,940
Later, I came here because—

711
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,380
Hey, Oh Je, we have a big problem.

712
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:11,200
Delivery orders are pouring in.

713
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:15,300
Welcome. Welcome.

714
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,240
What should I do?

715
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:20,860
Mom won't be back for a while.

716
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:22,740
Oh Dong, don't cry, don't cry.

717
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:24,880
Should I do the delivery?

718
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,970
That would be great, but there are a lot of orders.

719
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:33,230
Rather than that...

720
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,430
Is that his baby?

721
00:54:40,430 --> 00:54:42,480
He looks so young.

722
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,590
The baby looks exactly like his dad.

723
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:49,240
How handsome.

724
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,260
He's not mine.

725
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:05,760
Hey, you're looking pretty good.

726
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:08,690
Thank you, get on.

727
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:11,210
Oh Je, I have something to ask.

728
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:14,660
Tell me when we get there.
Let's get some tteokbokki.

729
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:18,000
Yoo Soo Bin.

730
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,180
Where is she?

731
00:55:21,010 --> 00:55:24,540
Do you know where she lives?

732
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:29,200
So that's how everything got so twisted.

733
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:33,410
No, these are all excuses.

734
00:55:34,850 --> 00:55:37,990
I didn't know what to do because it is my first time.

735
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:42,980
However, what I said was real.

736
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:47,510
Real.

737
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:02,130
It was real.

738
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:13,890
Real.

739
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:25,620
Da Huin said that if you go right now,
Soo Bin will be at home.

740
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:29,090
What is it that you have to give her in person?

741
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:33,630
Choi Joon Woo!
Why do you walk so fast?

742
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:36,110
We see each other often.

743
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:36,920
Yeah, I guess we do.

744
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:39,270
What are you doing here?

745
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:42,050
I'm here to meet Yoo Soo Bin.
See you at school.

746
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:44,820
I'm on my way to Soo Bin too.

747
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:48,830
Why Soo Bin?
You could just send a text.

748
00:56:48,830 --> 00:56:52,910
Hey, Ro Mi, I have something important to say to Yoo Soo Bin,

749
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:55,880
so can I talk with her first?

750
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,260
What?

751
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:07,090
I wanted to tell you something since I ran into you.

752
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:12,380
Fine, I'll receive your confession.

753
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:14,650
Today is day one.

754
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:17,730
You like me right?

755
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:21,860
I've been thinking about it for
a long time but I'll just accept your feelings.

756
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:24,820
Let's date.

757
00:57:27,890 --> 00:57:33,210
Ro Mi, I think there is something you're misunderstanding.

758
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:36,730
I don't like you.

759
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:41,800
What are you doing? Hard to get?
What do you mean you don't like me? You always look at me.

760
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,700
You thought I didn't know how you feel?

761
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:47,960
I like Yoo Soo Bin. I do.

762
00:57:49,890 --> 00:57:55,890
You probably thought I was looking at you because
I was looking at Soo Bin.

763
00:57:56,660 --> 00:58:01,510
I'm sorry for making you misunderstand,
but I thought you should know the truth.

764
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:06,990
How could you like her and not me?
She's Ma Hui Yeong's girlfriend.

765
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:11,030
Yoo Soo Bin is not Ma Hui Yeong's girlfriend.
I confirmed it.

766
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,800
Bye.

767
00:58:18,690 --> 00:58:22,480
I'm not sure if they'll make you take another level test.

768
00:58:24,850 --> 00:58:26,660
Yoo Soo Bin.

769
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:39,060
Hello, I am Choi Joon Woo.

770
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:41,590
I'm in the same class as Soo Bin.

771
00:58:43,110 --> 00:58:46,900
- I know, so what?
- I—

772
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:51,600
Cha Joon Woo, um, I have to go somewhere quickly.
I'll see you at school.

773
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:53,600
Wait.

774
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:03,020
May I briefly talk with Soo Bin?

775
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:23,200
♬ For many of my days ♬

776
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:27,000
♬ I wish you would stay ♬

777
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:29,400
♬ Even if the day is not special ♬

778
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:31,940
Hey, Soo Bin, do you want to watch a movie?

779
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:36,920
♬ You, who soothed my feelings and told me it's all right ♬

780
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:37,950
Another making of a couple?

781
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:40,030
Congrats Soo Bin!

782
00:59:40,030 --> 00:59:42,390
You can do it. You can do it.

783
00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:45,120
Welcome to the English open class!

784
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:46,550
Here we go!

785
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:49,080
Does anyone have another opinion?

786
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:52,360
I am against that opinion.

787
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:55,190
Go back to how it was and I'll cover it up.

788
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:59,660
I'll persuade Sang Hoon one last time.
Please have mercy.

789
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:04,160
Sang Hoon, let it slide just this once.

790
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:09,100
We can't be 18 again after it passes.

791
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:13,420
♬ You, who soothed my feelings ♬

792
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:17,470
♬ and told me it's all right, ♬

793
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:21,490
♬ I really need you ♬
