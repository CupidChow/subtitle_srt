1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,520
What? You bastard.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,130
Trash?

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,450
Yeah,
because you're blaming me for what you did.

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,520
Tell me truthfully what happened.

5
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,020
Sorry. My words were a bit harsh, weren't they?

6
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,780
I'm shocked because it's the first time I've ever been accused of doing something like this.

7
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,350
It's really nothing.

8
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,550
Episode 2:
The moment you want to run away

9
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,280
Why isn't Choi Joon Woo coming after saying he would?

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,510
I have to get off of work.

11
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,290
Joon Woo.

12
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,440
You can be honest with me.

13
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,470
The truth is, I already knew.

14
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,050
- Hey, where did the teacher's watch go? It was just here.
- He must've worn it out.

15
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,030
- He wasn't wearing it though.
- Did you see it on him?

16
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,910
- You should have told him.
- I was just trying to prank Song Joon Yeong.

17
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,310
I was going to hide it.

18
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,530
It's that kid isn't it.

19
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,990
It was that delivery guy.
The punk took it.

20
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:37,170
- No way.
- What do you mean, no way? I saw him before pretending to clean up and he was fooling with it.

21
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,240
This jerk--

22
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,450
Sang Hoon, I'll go instead.

23
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,720
Let go.

24
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,100
I'll go and see. He's from my class.

25
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,530
Hey Joon Woo, hold on.

26
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,130
I thought of it then.

27
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:56,500
Let's not worsen a situation which already happened.

28
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,170
Instead, let's find a way to help you.

29
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,270
Hey idiot. Do you really think he would just leave it there?

30
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:07,200
He would've hidden it already in his pockets or pants.

31
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,640
He's not a person who would do that.

32
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,820
What do you mean not? You said he was forcibly transferred to our school because he stole at his last school.

33
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,510
The rumors have already spread.

34
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,700
No wonder he looked a little off.

35
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,090
But...

36
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,270
It seems that Jo Sang Hoon in class 1 told everything to the teachers.

37
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,580
Even the fact that I knew everything.

38
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,610
Jo Sang Hoon.

39
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,360
Sorry, Joon Woo. I didn't think things would go this far.

40
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,700
But...

41
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,850
- Instead, you suspect me—
- Suspect?

42
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,080
It's not suspicion.

43
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,170
I saw everything.

44
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,570
What are you saying?

45
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:58,300
I thought you would have a reason.

46
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,150
You must have a reason even for how you're acting right now, too.

47
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,590
Hey! Choi Joon Woo!

48
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,820
Is that you Joon Woo? You must submit a written apology, but you're not coming. Why aren't you even answering my calls?

49
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,570
Come quickly.

50
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,490
Come quickly! Hurry!

51
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,000
Are you going to tell the sub homeroom teacher

52
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,620
what you're thinking?

53
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,950
Who knows?

54
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,550
Lee Gi Tae

55
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,130
You will be connected to the voicemail...

56
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,230
What are you doing? Not picking up.

57
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,600
Are you okay?

58
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,670
It must hurt.

59
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,570
You didn't go to the academy?

60
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,250
How could I go when you are like this?

61
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,690
Letter of Apology

62
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,770
No matter how much I think about it, I don't have anything to reflect on.

63
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:44,590
Omg. Hey you—

64
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,680
I didn't expect this.

65
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,020
You have talent! You expressed the ladybug well, but still,

66
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,220
let's rewrite this so we can submit something.

67
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,820
I'll get in trouble if you submit like this.

68
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,760
But I really don't have anything to write.

69
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,010
And your transfer will be on hold.

70
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,640
Hey, Joon Woo,

71
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,310
As you know, I'm a substitute homeroom teacher.

72
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:14,720
Big cases like this happening while I'm here and a transfer student transferring again,

73
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,140
the students are becoming distracted and following instructions less and less.

74
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,810
If this continues, how would this make me look?

75
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,930
Please just think of it simply.

76
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,560
A transfer student is just moving again because of his situation.

77
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,990
No, no, the reality of things isn't processed like that.

78
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:34,440
Ok, Joon Woo, first, with the reflection—

79
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,930
A reflection is not a drawing but

80
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,980
with writing...Wait, why did this come out?

81
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,190
So let's quickly...

82
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,440
Joon Woo.

83
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,470
Choi Joon Woo!

84
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,530
Hey! Choi Joon Woo.

85
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:59,860
Please, let's just write a reflection.

86
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,770
Hey! Hurry up and come here, Joon Woo!

87
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,770
Oh, it's so hot and it hurts so much...

88
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,970
Yes, good thinking. Here.

89
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,900
That's right. Come here.

90
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:26,620
Yeah.

91
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,200
After all, Oh Han Gyeol is just a temporary replacement.

92
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,030
Hey! Choi Joon Woo!

93
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,990
Hey, Jo Sang Hoon. Do you know what happens when you just trust your smarts and don't put in any effort?

94
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,430
You get dumber, punk.

95
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:42,620
Even if you become dumber, you're still better than Hui Yeong in math.

96
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,230
Don't be like that. How can you be so obvious about your bias?

97
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:50,520
There's no way he'd get it wrong. He got it wrong because he knew it was a misdeed.

98
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,720
It's not fair.

99
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,930
Hui Yeong.

100
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,100
Are you okay?

101
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:08,870
But hey, wasn't Ma Hui Yeong a little 'cringey' earlier?

102
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,760
"I just hope that even if it's just us that we don't have prejudice toward Joon Woo."

103
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,440
"We should believe him and become his strength."

104
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,020
Hey, if you keep going you'll get in trouble with Soo Bin.

105
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,430
Why would I?

106
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:24,960
I told you Hui Yeong is not my boyfriend. We were just pre-K school classmates.

107
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:32,120
But I do agree with what he said before.

108
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,970
Maybe we should've found a way to help out Choi Joon Woo.

109
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,670
I've thought about that too.

110
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,540
Why am I so pretty?

111
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,230
What the.

112
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:50,230
- Wow. Yoo Soo Bin, daebak.
- What?

113
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,320
You look so pretty Soo Bin.

114
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,830
What time is it right now?

115
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,370
Yoo Soo Bin, do you want to keep being like this?

116
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:08,680
Do you know how much the tutor my friend introduced me to costs?

117
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,270
If you don't go today that tutor goes out the door.

118
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:15,360
Yoo Soo Bin. Hey!

119
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,440
My mom, seriously.

120
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,500
Is there something going on?

121
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,030
You get tutoring? Math?

122
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:24,190
Who?
How much?

123
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:28,200
I really don't want to but my mom...

124
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,170
I should get going. See you tomorrow!

125
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:36,750
- Bye Soo Bin!
- Go well! Stop front-end colliding with your mom! (fighting)

126
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:42,230
Doing well in school seems so tiring, right?

127
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,920
My mom totally gave up on me.

128
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,170
She's just thankful that I attend school.

129
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,940
I'm going to get going too.

130
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,220
But don't you get tutored today Romi?

131
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,500
Going to a spa with my mom.

132
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,670
Bye.

133
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:02,230
Please Mom, I really don't want to get tutored.

134
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:05,290
- I'll just work really hard by myself.
- Is that what working hard looks like?

135
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:08,040
So when are you going to stop being second tier in math?

136
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,760
But Mom.

137
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,200
If you keep being like this, I'm going to find Hui Yeong's mom

138
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,360
- so you can get in his math academy.
- No, don't do that. I'll just go.

139
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,040
Be there in ten minutes, you dare be even a minute late.

140
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,830
How can I get there in ten minutes?

141
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,170
Why can't you be there in ten minutes?

142
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:27,540
The officetel is right by the school. Are you not at school right now?

143
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,250
No, you're right I'm at school.

144
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,430
Bye.

145
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,820
Seriously...I really hate this.

146
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:42,270
There's not a student that tutor has taught that hasn't gotten into Seoul National University.

147
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:46,070
Career is very important for her.

148
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,940
I'm in late! I won't be there in ten minutes. Ah...

149
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,370
You!

150
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,820
Yeah.

151
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,490
Hey! Where are you going right now?

152
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,940
- Part-time job.
- Is it far?

153
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,400
Oh your already there.

154
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,390
Turn it around.

155
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,120
I have something really important so I'll just borrow this.

156
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,180
You can't, my house is far away.

157
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,810
I promise to return it. Sorry!

158
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:32,320
I have to go home later and it's far away!

159
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,020
Sorry!

160
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,490
It's really far though.

161
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:44,770
Your mother said that Seoul National University was your goal.

162
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:49,050
Right, that's my mother's ideal scenario.

163
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:53,720
I'll just be thankful to be accepted with the major I want.

164
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,360
So you should work harder and make Seoul National University your goal like your mother--.

165
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,040
But I know, Teacher, that it won't happen even if I try.

166
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,080
I'm not that great intellectually.

167
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:11,070
I also don't want to be stressed out by making unrealistic goals for myself.

168
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:17,710
Still, I've already discussed this with your mother.

169
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,860
Teacher,

170
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:24,410
I've heard from all your previous students that you were a wonderful teacher

171
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,130
who helped them all get into Seoul National University.

172
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:30,010
I don't want you to needlessly stain your

173
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:34,850
perfect record just because of me.

174
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:42,800
I will try to convince my mom to forget about it tonight.

175
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,950
Thank you for taking the time to meet with me.

176
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:49,030
Yes, Soo Bin, you did well.

177
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,960
Did he get off work already?

178
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,450
Oh, you scared me.

179
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:45,800
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to see what you were looking at.

180
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,260
This.

181
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:17,460
Thank you for earlier. I was actually just playing with my friends and skipped study hall.

182
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,800
But my mom called urgently, so I had to go.

183
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,540
Thanks, for returning it.

184
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,880
Goodbye.

185
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,590
Hey, did you really think I'd just keep it?

186
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:33,720
If I couldn't meet you today, I was going to return it at school tomorrow.

187
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,630
I'm not coming tomorrow.

188
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,830
Didn't you say you would come until tomorrow?

189
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,950
I'm just not coming.

190
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,020
Is this what you call doing research?

191
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,060
I worked hard on it.

192
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:23,570
References are not only titles of books and the names of authors.

193
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,900
Here, I also wrote publishers.

194
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:32,260
You must specify where the quote comes from in the texts.

195
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,890
You've never done this before?

196
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,490
Anyway,

197
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,550
redo it by tomorrow.

198
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,820
I said I won't go starting tomorrow.

199
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:51,500
That's your business. Whether you come or not, shouldn't you take full responsibility of your part?

200
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,200
I took responsibility for my actions and came here to return your bike.

201
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:01,210
You weren't planning on hanging us out to dry
like an irresponsible person, were you?

202
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:05,060
You heard that I'm the queen of evaluation, right?

203
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:10,940
If I took you into our team,
you should have the courtesy to— Whoa!

204
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,320
Here, the eyes.

205
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:30,820
Is something in your eye?
Let me see.

206
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:37,420
I'll look at your eye for you.

207
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,110
No, not me.

208
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,650
Here.

209
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,500
He should've told me sooner.

210
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,790
H-Hey, I have something I want to ask you.

211
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,520
Please, a One Day pack.

212
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,860
I'll go first.

213
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,850
Thanks for the bike.

214
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:30,260
What is it...
that you're curious about?

215
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,970
Um...

216
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,150
Did you really...

217
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,900
steal the teacher's watch?

218
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,230
Never mind, I don't think so.

219
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,260
I'll go now.

220
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,910
Why?

221
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:58,380
Why do you think I didn't?

222
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,990
I thought you had a situation come up.

223
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,350
That there must be a reason for you being like this now, too.

224
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:18,050
Hui Yeong is studying right now.

225
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,360
Father, did you come?

226
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,600
What have you been doing, huh?

227
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,220
You look awkward standing like this.

228
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:36,800
You still can't sit and wait patiently?

229
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,160
- No. I was looking for my workbook—
- Where's your report card?

230
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:44,480
- It comes out tomorrow.
- Hui Yeong said he did really well.

231
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,390
You know him, right?
The son of Department Head Jo?

232
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:50,640
Jo Sang Hoon, in class 1.

233
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,780
Yes, Jo Sang Hoon.
The smart one.

234
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,570
You, be careful of guys like him.

235
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:02,080
The commoners who have only brains and nothing else.
They are the scariest.

236
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,210
That's me, too.
I had nothing but my brain to reply on

237
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,790
in order to climb to the top.

238
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,820
Not more, not less.

239
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:14,050
Just do as much as your brother did, okay?

240
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,390
Yes, sir.

241
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,000
What's this?

242
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,660
Open up.
Open this door!

243
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,460
Open it. Hey!

244
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,120
Do you know how hard I worked
to get you that teacher?

245
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,620
Why are you doing what you want to do?

246
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,290
I feel uncomfortable in those one-on-one meetings.

247
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:08,900
Are you seriously...

248
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,750
Are you at a time when
you can decide to be comfortable or uncomfortable?

249
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,690
Just look at your grades.

250
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:18,090
What's wrong with my grades?
Twenty-eighth in the whole school isn't that bad.

251
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:23,090
Parents in other households would praise their kids
if they took home the same results.

252
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:27,020
Are you the same as other households?
If you look at the ones in Seoul University,

253
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,700
do they act the way you do?

254
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:36,670
Soo Bin, do you know how hard it is for a woman
to succeed in this society?

255
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:39,920
Do you think you can start at the same level as men?
Never.

256
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:46,100
That's why, your family, parents, wealth,
education and looks are your assets.

257
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,280
You have it all. What don't you have?
What are you lacking?

258
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,030
All you need to do is study now!
Just suffer for two years until you end up at Seoul University!

259
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:56,690
You can do whatever you want by then.
I won't interfere.

260
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:59,580
But what, what am I expecting you to do right now?

261
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,130
All I'm telling you to do is study.
Why can't you do that?

262
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:06,430
Did I tell you to make money?
You can't compete against men in this society!

263
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:11,200
It's one hundred times harder, one hundred!

264
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,000
Do you have something to say?

265
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,780
I'll do well.

266
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,860
Go study.

267
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,830
- When is Dad com—
- When is Dad what? What about him?

268
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:28,740
You call him every day, so how would I know?
He'll probably be back when school's over.

269
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,970
Do you think I won't make you study if your dad's home?
Don't be ridiculous.

270
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,200
Don't shower too long, you'll get tired.
I'm going to check in on you at one.

271
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,140
Okay.

272
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,290
Here.

273
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,110
So what?

274
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,660
Thanks. For returning it.

275
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,300
Goodbye.

276
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,800
What an annoyance.

277
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:29,470
Bothersome.

278
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,820
She has nice handwriting.
Why did you think it wasn't me?

279
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,360
There were two reasons.

280
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:18,660
First, the way you act didn't seem like the way a thief would.

281
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:25,000
Overall, it seemed like you would
consider stealing something to be too much work.

282
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,120
Are you about to laugh?

283
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,980
What was your name again?

284
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,420
Do I have to go tomorrow?

285
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,620
I don't want to go.

286
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,810
I really don't want to go.

287
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:37,710
I really, really don't want to go.

288
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:08,650
Hurry up!
Today is Sunday so my mom is not there!

289
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:11,910
Joon Woo, wait for me!

290
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:12,860
Choi Joon Woo.

291
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,710
You're here early.

292
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:18,430
I had something to do.

293
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:21,720
For reference search and to turn in the practical evaluation.

294
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,880
You said you're leaving tomorrow, so what's the point?

295
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,600
I might not leave tomorrow.

296
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,590
Then when are you leaving?

297
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,260
Who knows?

298
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,790
This bastard is playing with me.

299
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,500
I see.

300
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,590
Ma Hui Yeong.

301
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,890
What?

302
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,750
Don't worry.

303
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,490
About what?

304
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:53,030
I won't tell anyone.

305
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:05,450
Joon Woo!
You're early today.

306
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:06,570
Hello, Hui Yeong.

307
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:10,090
- I'm in charge of bringing in the kids today, so take care of the kids inside.
- Okay.

308
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:11,830
Joon Woo, you don't have anything to say to me?

309
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:14,890
This little punk, after you ran away yesterday!

310
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:17,370
You go first.
You follow me.

311
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:19,350
- Over there.
- What?

312
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,330
- The assistant principal.
- What?

313
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,110
Hey, J—

314
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:26,120
Go.

315
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,780
- Here. The payment went through.
- Thank you.

316
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:45,990
Yeah?

317
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,360
School.

318
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:52,680
Right now?

319
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,560
No, I got it. I'll be there right away.

320
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,230
Gi Tae.

321
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:02,690
- So Ye!
- What are you doing?

322
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,780
I was getting this bound,

323
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:08,330
but something came up so I have to leave first.

324
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,860
- Sorry.
- What thing?

325
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,390
Hui Yeong?

326
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,830
Letter of Apology

327
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:48,370
Excuse me.
This first, then study.

328
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:07,170
And in this period, a great person appears.

329
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:09,820
Let's do this next time.

330
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:13,200
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

331
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,100
I'm so hungry.

332
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,060
Eat this.

333
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:29,880
She's fasting since she gained 500 grams.

334
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:34,890
Kwon Da Huin, why do you live like that?
Is it that important to look pretty in front of others?

335
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:38,100
Not others.
Just Oh Je.

336
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,860
Oh Je's ideal type is a super skinny girl.

337
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,980
Jung Oh Je, you—

338
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,760
Don't do it, don't say anything.

339
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,790
Soo Bin, what's up?

340
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:58,300
Oh, it's nothing.

341
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:05,160
- He's so handsome!
- She's acting like that again.

342
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,090
The transfer student isn't coming.

343
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,930
Choi Jin Woo?

344
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,310
What if he really got arrested?

345
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,450
He said he would transfer out, so he must have left.

346
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:19,540
Wow, that kid's impressive.

347
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,470
He's the type to do what he says.

348
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:25,660
Even if you go, shouldn't you
take responsibility for your part?

349
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:31,090
Ma Hui Yeong.

350
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,680
Ma Huii Yeong!

351
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,920
What is it?

352
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,450
Did the transfer kid really leave?
He's not coming back?

353
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,640
Joon Woo?

354
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:46,040
Who knows?

355
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:51,810
If he was going to leave, he should've said something.

356
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:13,590
Choi Joon Woo, that loser.

357
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:17,380
After all that talk, he's really not coming.

358
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,380
You came.

359
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,940
The references...

360
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,970
The Bare Tree

361
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:32,700
I did the parts we used, but for some, no matter how hard I searched, I couldn't find the part which was cited.

362
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:42,140
Wow! Choi Joon Woo, that bastard!

363
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:45,920
Get out.

364
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,140
Wow! So the transfer student really was a thief.

365
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,520
Wow! Overflowing respect.

366
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,910
The transfer student is bold.

367
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:02,020
Wow! Bastard, you are killer.

368
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:05,820
Hey, hey, where is my watch?
Oh, it's here.

369
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:09,840
Joon Woo, weren't you going to transfer?

370
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:13,160
I thought you already transferred.

371
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,410
Gi Tae, what's the problem?

372
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:19,310
Oh, I thought Joon Woo transferred,

373
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:23,500
so I was going to switch lockers
because it was uncomfortable.

374
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,040
But then...

375
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,150
Whoa! How much does that cost?

376
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:32,580
Why do it in front of everyone?

377
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:35,090
I didn't know it would be here.

378
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:41,080
How did you know I wasn't going to come in today?

379
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:47,650
- Huh?
- I only told Yoo Soo Bin about it.

380
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:50,580
I didn't tell anyone.

381
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:53,520
But you guys knew I wouldn't be coming in today.

382
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:58,120
Because you didn't come this morning...

383
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:06,740
Gi Tae, you were mistaken.
Joon Woo is leaving tomorrow.

384
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:10,200
I must have been confused.

385
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,900
Hey, dismissed.

386
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,090
Seriously.

387
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:42,250
I don't even know what to do since you are leaving.

388
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:48,920
Anyway, Teacher Oh before
this blows up you should take care of this.

389
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,590
Make sure there's no talk about this.

390
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:56,340
- We will take care of it.
- Hui Yeong.

391
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:01,820
I just talked with the teacher from the academy
and he says he will pretend nothing happened.

392
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:06,850
- Really?
- Yes. He just told me to bring the watch.

393
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:14,570
Hui Yeong! You are a very good negotiator.
You should become one.

394
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:16,990
Right.

395
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:20,370
Joon Woo, be assured since it's been settled.

396
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:24,910
As expected of our Hui Yeong.
You are our school's pride.

397
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,680
Is it settled?

398
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:34,890
We haven't caught who put it in my locker.

399
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:37,410
Look, you were forgiven.

400
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:40,170
I don't need to be forgiven.

401
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:44,290
I haven't done anything that needs to be forgiven.

402
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,000
What!

403
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,450
Ma Hui Yeong.

404
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:11,090
- Did you have to go this far?
- Huh?

405
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:16,580
I am going to leave this school
so you just had to let me go, but why?

406
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:20,570
What are you talking about?
You are being too much.

407
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,860
I think I made an effort to help you.

408
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:32,030
But then kids like you, you're all like that.

409
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:41,760
Today we'll be learning about our country's coasts.

410
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,340
In terms of our coasts, the three sides all respectively
have distinctive characteristics.

411
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:50,700
First, the East Coast.
It's comparatively simple.

412
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:55,380
In the case of the west and the southern coasts, how are they? They are really complex. Very complex!

413
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:59,060
Why?
Because the mountain ranges head toward the ocean...

414
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:16,840
There is a variety of land forms located here...

415
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,680
Teacher, I have a question.

416
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:22,140
- Yeah, Hui Yeong?
- About the last assignment...

417
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:26,720
The one last time, about volcanoes?

418
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,130
In regards to basaltic lava, because it has low viscosity

419
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:35,930
and high fluidity, it leads to flatter volcanic slopes.

420
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:38,800
Let's look at the extended exercises below.

421
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:52,700
Wow. Good show!

422
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,550
- Go!
- Run faster!

423
00:36:54,550 --> 00:37:00,510
- Where is Jo Sang Hoon?
- Sang Hoon? There. Sang Hoon!

424
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:07,760
- Jo Sang Hoon!
- What are you doing here?

425
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,810
Did you really see it?

426
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,210
- What?
- Me stealing the watch in the academy.

427
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:13,820
- What?
- Did you see?

428
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:23,190
Now this time we will learn about Ulleungdo and Dokdo.

429
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:25,660
Hey! Hey! The transfer student.

430
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,880
Have been ejected into—
Kids, what are you doing?

431
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,010
Hey! Isn't that Jo Sang Hoon wearing white?

432
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:34,270
Isn't that the transfer student?

433
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:37,680
- Transfer student.
- Hey! Won't you sit down!

434
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:44,390
Hey! Doesn't Jo Sang Hoon run really fast?

435
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:48,890
He was the representative since middle school.

436
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:51,380
Do we accept that?

437
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,690
Hey! Hey! Hey!

438
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:57,070
Jo Sang Hoon!
You need to pass the baton!

439
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:24,140
Stop chasing me! It's tiring!

440
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:29,450
Did you see me stealing?

441
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:34,480
How fast can you run?

442
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:39,230
- Hey, come in.
- I think they are fighting. What are they saying?

443
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:42,990
- Hey!
- Teacher, I think they are fighting and we have to stop them.

444
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:46,190
You can't hear.
So sit down. It's dangerous.

445
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:50,480
Sit down. Pil Sang, Go Dong.

446
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:54,120
Did you see?

447
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:59,690
- Did Hui Yeong say so?
- Yeah.

448
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,730
Jeez, Ma Hui Yeong.

449
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:08,630
Hey! Choi Joon Woo! Don't lose!

450
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:11,890
What's with them?
Hey! What's with you!

451
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:16,510
Oh my! The PE teacher.

452
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:19,160
Now, we will go back to class.

453
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,800
- Where did we leave off?
- I'm sorry, Teacher.

454
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,210
Alright, Hui Yeong.
Now, let's get back to the discussion.

455
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:30,780
The Siberian high is air in the wintertime that...

456
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:34,090
Go back! You punk!

457
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,830
Gosh, I'm messy!

458
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:19,290
Ma Hui Young, what's up with that transfer student?

459
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:21,140
Is he quicksilver?

460
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:23,300
What did Choi Joon Woo say?

461
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:29,320
I heard you told him I saw him do it.

462
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:32,250
Yes.

463
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:35,410
That's funny.

464
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:41,430
Why are you here? I don't want to play with you now.
My shoes are wet thanks to you.

465
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,680
This bastard. I told you.

466
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:55,750
What did you say?

467
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:09,500
That I also saw it.

468
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:14,190
Satisfied, Transfer Student?

469
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:27,070
I did well, didn't I?

470
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,790
Are you going?

471
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:41,000
No matter what?

472
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,120
Yes.

473
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:47,850
Earlier you were running around the track like crazy.
What was that about?

474
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:49,850
When you're leaving anyway?

475
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:57,060
I was curious
Why they did that.

476
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:02,250
Pretending to have seen when they didn't,
acting like they didn't do it when they did.

477
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:05,420
It was only just a curiosity?

478
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:21,370
Curious. Bullshit.

479
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:23,800
Hey. You're pissed off too.

480
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:27,270
You got stepped on, and you reacted!

481
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,830
If you do this, you're just a runner!
Do you understand?

482
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:36,780
Yes, go away!
Go then! You're not cool at all!

483
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:43,650
Hey Choi Joon Woo!
You're just a runner!

484
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:57,260
I'm in front of the school gate.
Come out.

485
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,540
Soo Bin!

486
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:03,610
- Why are you here?
- Let's go.

487
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:05,290
- Where are we going.
- We are going.

488
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:07,740
Don't tell me.
Private lessons?

489
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:10,120
Again another?

490
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,270
Why to Hui Yeong's house?

491
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:20,540
Soo Bin, take it.

492
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:23,030
Oh, what's all of this?

493
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:29,440
- What are you doing so suddenly?
- Hurry and come.

494
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:35,000
Who is it?

495
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,440
Hello. I've come to see the madam.

496
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,330
If you don't come, you will have no allowance.

497
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:46,920
Come in.
Hurry and enter.

498
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,890
Sorry to keep you waiting.

499
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:56,910
Why do you always bring so many things?

500
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:59,350
- Come, come.
- Yes, yes.

501
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:04,490
- Have a seat.
- Yes.

502
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,940
I was on the phone with my oldest son.
He's in the US.

503
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:14,590
I understand. I'm sorry for coming
suddenly without contacting you in advance.

504
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:17,170
Not at all. I totally understand.

505
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:21,560
Right now you're very worried.
Midterm exams are just around the corner.

506
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:25,860
But Soo Bin is very pretty.

507
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:30,670
That's big trouble. Girls that are so pretty.
They prevent boys from studying.

508
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:35,120
Thank you.

509
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:41,410
So, you want her to join Teacher Son Jae Yeong's class?

510
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:45,370
Yes.
No matter how hard I looked,

511
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:48,180
there are no math teachers like Teacher Son Jae Yeong.

512
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,160
That's true.

513
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:53,860
I talked to him and he said he needed your permission.

514
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:56,100
It's too much!

515
00:44:56,100 --> 00:45:00,360
What's this about getting my permission.
If you have the ability, then do it.

516
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:03,520
You know you have to take a level test.

517
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,430
Of course.

518
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:07,200
I...

519
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:10,830
- Nevertheless...
- Nevertheless...

520
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:16,530
We all know that nothing can be done
without your permission.

521
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:18,290
I'll count on you, Madame.

522
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:20,500
So, I will speak to him.

523
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,220
I'm thankful.

524
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,410
I'm home.

525
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:27,210
You came, Son?
Soo Bin and her mom are here.

526
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:29,310
- Hello.
- Hi, Hui Yeong.

527
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:32,370
It's nice to have such a handsome son.

528
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:34,390
Your son is so perfect.

529
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:38,250
What perfect?
I don't know about that.

530
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:41,120
He is so handsome.

531
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,450
As much as this time...

532
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:06,060
Crazy bitch.
She thinks she some sort of queen.

533
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:09,900
It's all due to her husband and her son.
She's a loser.

534
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:13,660
When I met her 20 years ago,
she didn't dare talk to me. What the hell.

535
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:16,640
She graduated from an unknown university.

536
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:26,470
I'm sorry for not telling you in advance.

537
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:29,430
Hey. This humiliation is just for a moment.

538
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,470
It can't be helped.

539
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:36,370
We have to take extraordinary measures.
Your rank as it is...

540
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:38,790
I'm sorry, Mom.

541
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:40,990
Huh?

542
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:46,560
Because I couldn't be first in the class like Hui Yeong,
you've had to humble yourself.

543
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:00,690
Ma Hui Yeong.

544
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,410
You did well.

545
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:18,820
Although you will never see Son Jae Yeong again,
you should still tread lightly.

546
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:26,370
You said that before.

547
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:31,390
It is as you said, "kids like you."

548
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:38,820
What kind of kids are the "kids like you"
that you talk about?

549
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:40,380
That?

550
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:43,390
That is...

551
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,520
By the way, where are you transferring to?

552
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,920
Onyang. My mom works there.

553
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:57,460
Kids like you?

554
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:03,630
What I meant by kids like you...
Nothing much.

555
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:07,400
Although you breathe and are living, well...

556
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:11,960
Even if you keep living on like this,
I wonder what hope there could possibly be.

557
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:16,980
Whatever...
People who you can treat however you want?

558
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:25,520
You just keep living on since you were thrown
out into the world without any kind of blessings.

559
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,250
You're still breathing,

560
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:30,890
so you don't have the courage to disappear.

561
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:37,260
They are pitiful.
Kids like you.

562
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:49,450
You?

563
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:54,070
You're not pitiful?

564
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,630
Why?
I'm different from you.

565
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:07,260
Get going.

566
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:14,430
You said you were curious about this, too, didn't you?

567
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:18,670
You were leaving anyway,
so I could have left you alone, so why?

568
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:21,130
Why did I have to go that far?

569
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,370
Because you offend me.

570
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:33,050
Because you kept making issues of things when all you had
to do was just go along with it quietly and disappear.

571
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:36,030
For me.

572
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:40,600
Your question was answered, right?

573
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,360
All of it?

574
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:25,290
- Yes, Mom.
- Did you pack?

575
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:29,920
For now, pack a little bit.
I'll go to Seoul on Sunday and do it instead.

576
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:35,790
Earlier today I went to your school, and it was nice.

577
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:41,160
Forget it all.
Come here and let's just study hard, Joon Woo.

578
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:46,970
You'll do well in a good university.
When I see your dad later, I'll brag about you.

579
00:50:49,690 --> 00:50:51,400
Dad?

580
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,800
Where is he living?
Can you contact him?

581
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:01,040
Of course, I'm still in touch.

582
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:06,870
I told you. Because of his company,
I heard that he's living in Pohang or somewhere.

583
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:10,020
He's very worried about you but he can't contact you.

584
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:15,500
Mom, I'm hanging up. I'm on my way home.

585
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,730
Joon Woo. Joon—

586
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:44,410
Mom, you think I don't know where he lives, right?

587
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:02,260
I know where this person lives.

588
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:10,590
I think I have more courage since I'm about to leave,

589
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:12,560
to see that person just once before leaving.

590
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:20,770
The person who made me come
into the world without any good luck.

591
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:24,260
Choi Myeong Joon.

592
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:28,440
Who is there?

593
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,800
♬ It won't do ♬

594
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:38,420
Excuse me, but...

595
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:41,260
We haven't finished our jjajangmyeon yet.

596
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:43,450
Tell him I'll put the dishes out in half an hour.

597
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:45,800
We will put them out in half an hour.
(Delivery person comes back to collect crockery in Korea)

598
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:03,950
Can I do something for you?

599
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,300
You...

600
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:22,610
You don't know me?

601
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:25,090
What?

602
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:30,290
I think you found the wrong house.

603
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:33,160
Dad!

604
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,090
Did you have fun?

605
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:38,730
By chance, do you know Choi Myeong Joon?

606
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:40,290
No, I don't know him.

607
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:43,250
Alright.

608
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:51,590
By chance, do you know Choi Myeong Joon?

609
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:55,080
Choi Myeong Joon? No.

610
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:06,470
I thought I finally found you.

611
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:16,990
I always thought how our first
meeting would be and what should I say.

612
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,020
But...

613
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,460
Yes?

614
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:23,330
I wanted to know if you had returned home.

615
00:56:23,330 --> 00:56:26,040
Yes I did.

616
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,130
I'm packing my stuff now.

617
00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:33,940
Joon Woo, I'm sorry for earlier.
Mom just wanted to...

618
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:35,890
What for?

619
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,980
I will be good when I come.

620
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:42,930
No, no. Even when you come,
don't try so hard to do things well.

621
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:46,600
As long you are with me, I'm fine.

622
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:51,400
Women here are in a hurry to see my handsome son.

623
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,020
You know Hae Yeong, right?

624
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:56,700
Today she made kimchi for your arrival.

625
00:56:56,700 --> 00:57:00,800
- And Seon Mi, you know. Seon Mi—
- Sorry, Mom.

626
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:03,400
Huh?

627
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:07,540
To bring problems again.

628
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:15,040
Now, I want to be a better person.

629
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,790
What is this?
It's not your fault.

630
00:57:19,790 --> 00:57:22,810
It's all because of these jerk people.

631
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:27,470
Because you do not live with your mother,
they think you are a pushover.

632
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:34,220
Who can I blame?
It's all because of me.

633
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:38,300
I should be right there next to you.

634
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:41,320
Because of the money, I'm always like this.

635
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:45,320
Mom, are you crying again?

636
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:49,920
No, why would I?
If I'm crying, it would mean I have failed.

637
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:57,570
And you, don't ever get down thinking
that you're running away from there, okay?

638
00:57:57,570 --> 00:58:02,300
Mom is here, so that's why you are coming to live with me.

639
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:07,070
Let's live here happily, Joon Woo.

640
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:13,950
Mom... Mom is really happy right now.
You know it, right? Because I can live with my son.

641
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:18,030
I will be able to prepare your breakfast every day.

642
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:22,090
I will also be able to take care of your school uniform.

643
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:27,200
- I'm really happy.
- Yes.

644
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,000
Oh, have a good night.

645
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:12,760
Hey, if you do this, you're just a runner.
Do you understand?

646
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:16,420
Yes, go away!
Go then! You're not cool at all!

647
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:19,250
Fine! You runner!

648
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:21,270
I'm running away.

649
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:25,460
Why do I have to continue to run away from things?

650
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:28,890
Why do I have to keep running away?

651
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:32,270
Is it because somehow I do not care about my life?

652
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:36,190
I have pity for kids like you.

653
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:39,430
Like me?

654
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:53,180
I'm sorry, Joon Woo.

655
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:57,410
Because of me, because of me...

656
00:59:57,410 --> 00:59:59,600
My son, I'm really sorry.

657
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:03,820
I'm sorry.

658
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:29,500
Don't cry, Mom.
If you cry, I see everything.

659
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:41,240
I'm not crying. I'm in bed right now.

660
01:00:45,490 --> 01:00:48,170
Mom is young and immature.

661
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:54,460
But she did not abandon me and flee,
although she was young.

662
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:58,610
She didn't run away.

663
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:24,120
Everyone, I have good news for you.

664
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:30,580
Regarding the simulated exam,
our Hui Yeong is the first student in the ranking

665
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:34,270
for each subject.

666
01:01:38,310 --> 01:01:39,350
Hui Yeong, you rock!

667
01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:40,680
Ma Hui Yeong!

668
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,600
- Ma Hui Yeong.
- How can he be so capable?

669
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,670
Right?

670
01:01:44,670 --> 01:01:47,620
- Ma Hui Yeong!
- Hui Yeong?

671
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:49,940
You can say a few words to everyone.

672
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,890
- Thank you, Teacher.
- Ah, don't mention it.

673
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:58,420
Thank you, everyone.

674
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:02,130
I think I did great today because I'm lucky,
but I will continue to study harder.

675
01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:04,840
Let's all do our best next time.

676
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:07,200
Fine, applause!

677
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:10,270
So cool!

678
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:21,870
♬ Please don't say a word,
'cause they all left and said now ♬

679
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:27,210
♬ Like a journey coming to an end ♬

680
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:33,570
♬ You say let it run like the river
while them without a care ♬

681
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:44,090
♬ Just like the days
we were young and fumbling ♬

682
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:47,350
♬ Everything fades away ♬

683
01:02:47,350 --> 01:02:50,500
♬ Let it go by with a flow ♬

684
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:57,290
♬ I really wish I could stay, but you know me. ♬

685
01:02:57,290 --> 01:03:00,640
♬ All the moments we shared ♬

686
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:04,330
Moment at Eighteen
~ Preview ~

687
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:06,040
Ma Hui Yeong, don't mess with me.

688
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:11,260
In pairs, you guys will spend 3 minutes free talking
but the learning leader will pick the pairs randomly.

689
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:14,730
It's good that you didn't run away.

690
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:18,530
If any problems arise just feel free to tell me.

691
01:03:18,530 --> 01:03:20,770
- Yes.
- "Yes", that conventional answer.

692
01:03:20,770 --> 01:03:23,540
If her grades, her English,
and her exams are ruined because of you,

693
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:28,050
I don't think it's something someone like you could deal with.
Not for your but for Soo Bin's sake.

694
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:31,540
Why are you even thinking of me?
Because I'm weaker? Because I look pitiful?

695
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:34,400
Okay. I guess Joon Woo isn't who I thought he was.

696
01:03:39,930 --> 01:03:44,840
♬ Everything fades away. Just go with the flow. ♬
