1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,620
Why am I doing this to you?

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,700
Whether I'm doing this out of sympathy?

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,530
I know it's not, so I—

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,260
I'm doing it because I like you.
What are you going

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,410
to do?

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,670
Hey, Choi Joon Woo!

7
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,120
Episode 6
The timing between action and reaction

8
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,190
Are you okay?

9
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,180
You're alright?

10
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,410
I'm okay, but

11
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,400
Beom Bi, this punk, got hurt.

12
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,050
Beom Bi?

13
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:07,510
No way.
The name of this bike?

14
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,610
I got surprised.
His name was Beom Bi.

15
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:20,090
Hi Beom Bi, I'm Soo Bin.

16
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,410
Don't bother.

17
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,210
Why?
I want to say hi to Beom Bi...

18
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,620
No, no, no. Not that.

19
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,860
You said it's your friend.

20
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:33,130
You heard it wrong.
It's a misunderstanding. Misunderstanding.

21
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,610
It's like that, Yoo Soo Bin?

22
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:40,090
It isn’t Beom Bi.

23
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:49,160
Why did I do that?
You're crazy Yoo Soo Bin.

24
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,830
I'll have to give some sort of answer.

25
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,910
What should I say to her?
Think, Choi Joon Woo.

26
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,610
Think. Think.

27
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,590
- Hey.
- Hey.

28
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,720
That's right Choi Joon Woo. Reaction!

29
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,100
You go first.

30
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,550
No way. What?

31
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,670
Did I get rejected?

32
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,450
What I told you earlier,

33
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,990
it was a joke.
Today, I...

34
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:23,680
I... today my feelings are... just messed up...

35
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,350
What are you saying, Yoo Soo Bin?

36
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,820
I was also offended by what you said earlier so

37
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,450
I wanted to see how you would react.

38
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,400
I'm leaving.

39
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,430
Really.

40
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,150
Are you really going to leave your home?

41
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,420
It seemed like that's what you were saying earlier,
with your mom.

42
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,430
Don't worry about it.

43
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,100
Hey—

44
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:17,190
Yoo Soo Bin, Soo Bin.

45
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:26,360
Choi Joon Woo, what are you doing?
Are you crazy?

46
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,840
Hello.

47
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,730
Right. Dating is all about timing.

48
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:44,260
If you miss that timing, you end up opening hell's gates.

49
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,300
Timing.

50
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,290
Park Yeong Bae.

51
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,330
Did something happen again?

52
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,400
No.

53
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:59,260
Hey Park Yeong Bae, be careful of that little kid.

54
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:04,620
She looks really innocent on the outside
but she doesn't seem like that when you get to know her.

55
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,560
That girl.
The one that rode with you on the bike.

56
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,470
The one with the really handsome boyfriend. Hey!

57
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,170
Soo Bin.

58
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,700
Soo Bin.

59
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,760
Don't beat yourself up.

60
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:34,090
How did you know I was doing that?

61
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,960
You guys don't think I—

62
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,590
You're just here regretting your choices
after getting in a fight with your mom, aren't you?

63
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,490
Mom.

64
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,360
I forgot.

65
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,990
No way.

66
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,700
You didn't get your hair grabbed
and get hit by your mom, right?

67
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:55,000
Isn't it that?
Short term memory loss.

68
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,860
Hey. Call your mom quickly.

69
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,090
You should start begging before you miss the golden time.

70
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:04,490
If you don't, the pocket money
will stop and the punishment will only increase. Really.

71
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,280
I'm not going to go home today.

72
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,590
Until my mom apologizes to me
and gets on her knees, I'm never going back.

73
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,920
Anyone want to let me sleepover?

74
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,370
We're remodeling our kitchen so it's a mess at my house.

75
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,200
What to do?

76
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,190
Kwon Da Huin.

77
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,160
Moon Chan Yeol?

78
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,120
Would Ro Mi be doing well on the level test?

79
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,160
Right. It was supposed to be today.

80
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,800
I'll ask her.

81
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,280
Teacher, I'll do whatever I can to bring Soo Bin back.

82
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,140
Please forget that she said that she'd stop coming.

83
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:09,960
But Mother, it seems like Soo Bin
doesn't want to listen to my lectures.

84
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,560
How about accepting Soo Bin's wishes?

85
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,010
No. What would she know, Teacher?

86
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,930
She's acting like she doesn't want to.
She's just giving me a hard time.

87
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,700
Hello, Ajumma.

88
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,300
I'm Soo Bin's friend Ro Mi.

89
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,260
I submitted my test to you, Teacher.

90
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,390
Okay.

91
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,830
Yoo Soo Bin that dumb girl.

92
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:53,100
Because Soo Bin stopped coming to the class,
I got the opportunity.

93
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,640
I'm grateful.

94
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,620
Soo Bin didn't stop going to the class.

95
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,360
- I heard it like that.
- No, you heard it wrong.

96
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,430
My driver is here.
I'll be going then, Ajumma.

97
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,860
Alright, bye.

98
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,260
Did you work hard just to give it way to that brat?

99
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:12,580
That idiot. Really.

100
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:16,360
Really dumb girl. Really.

101
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,530
You loser!

102
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,690
I'm doing this because I like you.
What are you going to do about it?

103
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,260
Yoo Soo Bin, are you going to have it all?

104
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,910
What?

105
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,270
Welcome.

106
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:56,520
Choi Joon Woo.
Do you work part-time here?

107
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,590
Yes.

108
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:01,490
That’s kind of romantic.

109
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:04,980
- How are you studying for your midterms?
- Welcome.

110
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,820
You didn't make any progress with your prior school, right?
Do you want me to help you with your notes?

111
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,260
Do you want me to help you with your notes?

112
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:11,930
I don't usually show these things to anyone,
but I'll show them especially to you.

113
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,900
Hey ... Moon Chan Yeol.
I'm a little busy right now.

114
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,000
Moon Chan Yeol?

115
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:28,790
Sorry. Jeong Da Huin?
No, Kwon Da Huin?

116
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,260
Here.

117
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:40,000
That'll be 13,600 won.
Here you go.

118
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,200
You're just trying to joke around with me, right?

119
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,690
Yoon So Hye?

120
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,960
Ro Mi. Hwang Ro Mi.
Say it back to me. Hwang. Ro. Mi.

121
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,030
How much does this cost?

122
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:55,440
I think I'll have to put a label on that.
Just a moment.

123
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,030
Sorry.

124
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,500
That'll be 7000 won.

125
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,260
Choi Joon Woo didn't even know my name?

126
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,770
He said he liked me.
How does he not know my name?

127
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:20,570
Then again, I guess men are like that.

128
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:23,740
Names aren't important to them.

129
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,230
Still, he's unique.

130
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,700
Ro Mi, did you do well on the level test?

131
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,700
Why did you come so late?!
I waited so long for you.

132
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,860
Hey.

133
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,430
You left this.

134
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,340
Thanks.

135
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,090
Ro Mi's friend?

136
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:42,100
I'm Ro Mi's father.

137
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,930
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

138
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,730
What are we doing not leaving already?

139
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:51,000
See you again.

140
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,700
Your classmate?
Wow he's really kind, to even be doing part-time work.

141
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,790
Why do you show people that you know me?
Just stay still.

142
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:07,540
Does he think I'm a driver too?

143
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,350
I made a mistake.
What do I do?

144
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,400
It's fine.

145
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:18,530
Yes, Yes.
I'll bring it to you immediately.

146
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:23,540
Yeong Bae. I'm going to the academy for a delivery.
Please look after here.

147
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,630
- I'll go.
- Will you?

148
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:31,610
- Yes.
- Here. Thank you.

149
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,210
Oh!

150
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,910
Whoa.

151
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,020
Joon Woo. Did Ma Hui Yeong's mother tell you
to make a delivery?

152
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,690
Yes.

153
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:15,600
Hey, isn't this so cool?
I ran a ton of part-time jobs and barely managed to buy it.

154
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:21,320
- What? You have something to say to me?
- About Teacher Son Jae Yeong's watch.

155
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,290
Oh no, no comment. I don't want to get involved in that.

156
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:29,280
I know.
That you won't tell anybody.

157
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:40,610
Ma Hui Yeong stealing that teacher's watch.
Although you saw it.

158
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,760
You're probably just using it to annoy Ma Hui Yeong.

159
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,180
Just until the right time to blow it up.

160
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,760
Choi Joon Woo, you, you're pretty smart up there.

161
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:56,130
That day. What was the situation then?
Right before Ma Hui Yeong stole the watch.

162
00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:01,000
That day? That day.

163
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,610
That day I got praised by Teacher Son Jae Yeong,
for being good at math.

164
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:10,190
Ma Hui Yeong probably got riled up because
of that and stole Teacher Son Jae Yeong's watch.

165
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:15,420
He's done that a couple of times before too.
He gets riled up and causes issues.

166
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:20,300
Whenever that happened, his mother defended him fiercely.

167
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,120
I wish I had a mom like her too.

168
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:39,090
Ma Hui Yeong. I guess I have to reveal
what kind of person you really are.

169
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:44,010
What went wrong, I should correct it quickly.

170
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,700
Yoo Soo Bin, are you crazy?
You're just going to do whatever you want?

171
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,100
You told me to get out.
I'm going to listen to you this time.

172
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,190
Really? Live there forever then.

173
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:59,000
Okay, I'll do that. I'm going to live my life.
I'm only eighteen.

174
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,460
Yoo Soo Bin.
Aren't you going at this a little too strong?

175
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:07,120
Now, I feel like I can do that.
Mom, I hope you too can take care of your life. Bye.

176
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,540
I don't know. My fingers aren't listening to me.
I must be crazy.

177
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,350
I feel relieved.

178
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:20,540
Aren't you going to send it? Faker!

179
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,110
Scaredy cat.

180
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:26,620
When you can't even speak harsh words to your Mom why did you leave the house? You can never win over your mom.

181
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:30,190
You can never beat your mom.

182
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,480
This came out.

183
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:40,600
Last time you told me that it was a sign
that I could win and that I should put hope in it.

184
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,650
Did I do that?

185
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,890
What is this? I thought you guys said
you guys couldn't sleepover tonight.

186
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:55,690
- I was saying we can't at my house.
- I got permission too.

187
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:59,050
Ah really!
The house is small enough as it is!

188
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:04,280
Ah, I don't know, don't know, don't know! So excited!

189
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:12,240
- Be quiet! A pajama party? There are exams soon. This is a problem. Exams are right around the corner.
- You’re right.

190
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,450
Seriously. Oh, you guys!

191
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:19,330
Hey. Give me mine, mine.

192
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:24,110
It's night and my grandmother is here.
So let's have fun quietly. Quietly.

193
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:29,590
What if your grandma comes upstairs?
Play some music.

194
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:32,540
Let's just listen to songs. Really.

195
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,200
It's coming up, it's coming up!

196
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,100
Stand up guys!

197
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:42,120
Hey!

198
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,770
Stop it. Calm down.

199
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,750
Damn. Madam Kwon.

200
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:01,430
So Ye. Are you still angry?

201
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,210
I'm in front of your house.
I'll wait until you come out.

202
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:30,670
Go! Go as you wish!
Go and live how you want!

203
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:33,240
You don't think I can't go if you tell me to leave?

204
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,900
Thank you!
For letting me live how I want!

205
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:46,500
You perhaps, didn't leave the house right?

206
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,780
Did I send it uselessly?

207
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,430
What are you doing?

208
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,010
- Oh Je.
- Yes.

209
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:01,460
- Hurry up and go home.
- Okay.

210
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,050
Why?

211
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,840
I'm going to Moon Chan Yeol's place for delivery.
If you're not sleeping,

212
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:17,350
I was going to drop off some tteokbeokki at your place.
My family's tteokbeokki is killer.

213
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,670
Why a delivery?

214
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,850
The girls are there right now.
Yoo Soo Bin's group.

215
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:27,170
Kwon Da Huin's summons.

216
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:33,140
What's this, Yoo Soo Bin?
Did you really run away from home?

217
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,090
Tteokbeokki, next time.

218
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,080
Is Yoo Soo Bin not going home tonight?

219
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:55,400
Yoo Soo Bin is...
No, no, she'll probably go home.

220
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,650
The night road must be dangerous.

221
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,230
Maybe she'll just sleep there?

222
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:21,970
To go get her, or not to go.

223
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:36,530
This is normally to go.
Yes. This is to go, right. To go.

224
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,690
Where is Chan Yeol's house?

225
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:54,810
Yes, Choi Joon Woo. Yes.
This time's reaction, properly. Properly. Yes.

226
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:04,460
Go. I'm going to sleep with the girls at Chan Yeol's house.

227
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,160
Chan Yeol's house?

228
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:18,080
Soo Bin's at Chan Yeol's house.
Yoo Soo Bin.

229
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,100
I haven’t finished everything for today.

230
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:55,830
I'm in front of Chan Yeol's house.
I'll wait. Until morning at least.

231
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:02,630
Here, here, here.
Yes, yes, yes.

232
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:08,610
My daughter whom I love the most in the whole wide world,
I'm afraid if you don't go to a good college

233
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:13,020
that people would look down on you.

234
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,770
- So Ye. You're going?
- Yes.

235
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:47,320
My mom's come to pick me up.
I'm leaving. Sorry.

236
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,420
Ah, am I overdoing it?

237
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,470
I think she'll go home.

238
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,740
What if she asks why I came?

239
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,890
Let's go, Yoo Soo Bin.

240
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,350
- Yoo Soo Bin.
- Oh my gosh! Hui Yeong!

241
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,660
Were you surprised?

242
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:04,940
Sorry.
I was going to message you now, but you came out.

243
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,380
- Why?
- To take you home.

244
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,790
Mom told you to take me home, right?

245
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:10,930
No.

246
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:13,270
No. I heard that your mom came to school earlier.

247
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:16,850
I figured Yoo Soo Bin would do a rebellious act.

248
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,700
- Let's go.
- No, it's okay. I can go by myself.

249
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,940
It's dangerous, and it's dark over there.
Let's go.

250
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,610
It's really okay though.

251
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:42,320
You slowpoke.

252
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:51,350
You must also be stressed out with midterms coming up.

253
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,930
I'm curious about something.

254
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:57,900
About what?

255
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,810
Is there something between you and Choi Joon Woo?

256
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,070
Why?

257
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:10,730
Just... how last time you all went
to the counseling room together.

258
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,780
The counselor was wondering
how Joon Woo was doing in school.

259
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,810
And they asked if there's another
reason why Choi Joon Woo hit me.

260
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:29,730
Do you think I'm hiding something?

261
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,260
It's not that.

262
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,930
Did I upset you?

263
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:43,490
Eh, I think you're a little butthurt.

264
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:45,610
No, I'm not.

265
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,370
You don't know how bad I am, right?

266
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:54,550
Why are you getting butthurt over this,
Ma Hui Yeong kiddo?

267
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,310
I'm really not butthurt.

268
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,850
Really?

269
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,360
I liked it when I was child Ma Hui Yeong.

270
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:11,600
I told you everything, got scolded
by you and you hit my back.

271
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,600
Really?
Then you want me to hit your back now?

272
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,800
- It's okay.
- I mean, it's not hard to hit you. Like this!

273
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,290
No thanks.

274
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:27,430
It's late, let's hurry.

275
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,900
Should we run? It's late.

276
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,170
You probably won't be able to catch up.

277
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,730
Yoo Soo Bin, wait for me!

278
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,130
Mom, I'm home.

279
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,960
Instead, I'll do well on the midterms.

280
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,830
M-Math, I'll get first rank.
First rank.

281
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:13,020
Believe me just once.

282
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,630
Soo Bin, do you think right now

283
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:22,680
is the time to slowly look at the situation,

284
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,130
go through trial and error,

285
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:28,750
and repent?

286
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,900
Now's not the time for that.

287
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,030
You're in Grade 11. Grade 11.

288
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:37,460
For you, every time, every instance

289
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:42,030
is exam time, and if you do one thing wrong,

290
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:45,020
one road, a thousand roads will collapse.

291
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:54,570
Mom, why do you think like that?

292
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:58,000
Don't think like that, just once.

293
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,300
I'll do well. Okay?
I can work hard. Watch.

294
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:06,830
Ah, when you came to my school earlier, my arm.

295
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:09,100
It became like Ma Dong Seok Ajusshi.
(famous actor)

296
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,720
The actor Ma Dong Seok.
The Household Diety, you saw the movie, right?

297
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,590
- Wow, it became like this big.
- Did I hit your arm? I hit your shoulder.

298
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:20,770
- No, it was right here.
- Hey, Ma Dong Seok’s arm is...

299
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:23,690
Ahhh, it hurts. What am I going to do?

300
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,990
Ah, it hurts so much.
Won't it break?

301
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:29,790
I'll study! I'll go and study!

302
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,860
Good night!

303
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,210
Where were you?

304
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,070
I went out to get some air because it was stuffy.

305
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:52,890
You're like that because you don't focus and study.

306
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:56,550
You're frustrating, itching here and there.

307
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,220
I'll go up.

308
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:06,250
Your homeroom teacher can't come out
to school anymore because he was admitted, right?

309
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,520
How do you know that?

310
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:14,410
The substitute teacher became the homeroom teacher.

311
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:36,330
Again, Mom.

312
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:41,060
It's exam time. Sit down.

313
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:53,150
Yoo Soo Bin, you might not be able to see her again,

314
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:55,670
if you go out again like today.

315
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:07,100
I love you.

316
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:32,690
You didn't leave your house, right?

317
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:36,540
This kid, he only sent this one message.
What is he trying to do?

318
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:40,570
I mean, if you're worried, you should ask more!

319
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:45,100
But then, why would you worry about me?

320
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,570
He was probably just bored.

321
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:52,790
Yoo Soo Bin, why would you say that?

322
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:59,220
Ah, today is just full of embarrassment.

323
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:20,670
And, I'm not Ma Hui Yeong's girlfriend.

324
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,360
Lie, again.

325
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:32,880
You're a liar, Yoo Soo Bin.

326
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:46,740
I was joking earlier.

327
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:52,310
I... today my feelings are... just messed up.

328
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:55,800
I was also offended by what you said earlier so

329
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,170
I wanted to see how you would react.

330
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,790
Real lie?

331
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,840
Hey Joon Woo!

332
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,570
- Hi Jeong Oh Je!
- Oh Je!

333
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:44,030
- Hi.
- Hi.

334
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:46,760
- Did you eat?
- Of course.

335
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,740
I made tuna salad. Do you like tuna?

336
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,270
Oh, hey.

337
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,570
Hi, Choi Joon Woo.

338
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:00,140
Oh, hi.

339
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:05,960
Why didn't you respond last night?

340
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,190
Oh, well...

341
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:10,260
Well, I was going to respond, but...

342
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:14,630
Hey, Yoo Soo Bin!

343
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:17,910
Hi. Oh, it's nothing.

344
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:20,230
Oh, Beom Bi is all better now!

345
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:22,840
Beom... What's Beom Bi?

346
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,490
Oh, well...

347
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:30,170
- Choi Joon Woo's bike.
- Tha— That's a secret.

348
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:35,570
A relationship where you share your bike's name?

349
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:39,370
- What is this?
- It's not like that.

350
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,820
Let's go.

351
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,560
Let's go.

352
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,480
Look at him.

353
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,720
Every time he sees me, his face gets red.

354
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,870
He is cute.

355
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:09,600
It's not your way, huh?
It's her way?

356
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,960
Ro Mi, did you do well on the level test yesterday?

357
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,890
Of course!

358
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:16,470
Your mom came to the tutoring center yesterday.

359
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:21,500
- She seemed really upset because of you.
- Yeah.

360
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,480
Yoon So Ye, when did you go yesterday?

361
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:29,990
Sorry, my mom told me to go so... Sorry.

362
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,560
You backstabbers.

363
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:35,560
You made me and Kwon Da Huin suffer.
We couldn't study at all.

364
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,710
Did you go home too?

365
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:39,310
Yeah.

366
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,240
Bring this to the classroom,
and get the printouts from the teachers' office.

367
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,960
Okay!

368
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:01,160
The seats. Let's change them back.

369
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:06,120
If I said that, then it should be enough.

370
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,660
Alright.

371
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:17,850
Good morning everyone!
Shall we sta...

372
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,830
Why is the seating...

373
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:25,690
Teacher, we'll just sit where we are.
Everyone likes it that way.

374
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:27,240
Everyone?

375
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:31,180
Did you guys vote?

376
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:35,390
It's not that.
Everyone said this is better for exam prep.

377
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:38,870
Yeah, this is better.

378
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:41,340
- I think so too.
- That's right.

379
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,880
Only they like it.

380
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,480
One-hundred percent?
There isn't anyone opposed?

381
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,530
I don't like it.

382
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,760
Me either.

383
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:04,900
Me either. It's a little...

384
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:11,710
Okay then, let's try this.

385
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:18,910
What is this?

386
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,900
It's Class 3 again, huh? Class 3.

387
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:38,270
Those who agree with
the Class President are sitting in the front,

388
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:41,590
The rest of you sit wherever you want.

389
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,330
Okay!

390
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:45,330
Who wants to sit here?

391
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,550
Who wants to sit here?

392
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:50,270
Kwon Da Huin and Oh Je.

393
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:53,250
Yoo Soo Bin! Yoon So Hye!
Who wants to sit here?

394
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,810
Choi Joon Woo.

395
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:04,410
Ro Mi, your seat.

396
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,690
Eun Ji, sit here.

397
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:17,200
Alright, but Ro Mi, I don't really like sitting in the front.

398
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,710
Hey, hey. Let's do it!

399
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,380
Pil Sang!

400
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:27,300
Pil Sang has changed!
In the front row!

401
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,790
Welcome.

402
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,520
Okay everyone's satisfied, right?

403
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:41,660
Teacher. I think the classroom environment
is going to be too distracting.

404
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,290
Why, this is good.

405
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:47,350
Pil Sang sat in the front row to do better in school.

406
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:50,360
- It's good, right?
- Yes. It's good!

407
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:54,810
See, someone else thinks differently.
You should relax too.

408
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:56,720
Relax.

409
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,490
That Oh Han Gyeol.

410
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:03,210
New Teacher's trying to stand out by doing that.

411
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:09,460
It makes me mad.
Why did our homeroom teacher have to get hurt?

412
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:12,130
He should've drunk accordingly.

413
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:15,960
But Oh Han Gyeol is our homeroom teacher now.
We need to listen to him.

414
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,190
Oh Han Gyeol totally has the power now.

415
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:21,290
He has the students in the palm of his hand.

416
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:22,120
Look closely.

417
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,800
I don’t know.

418
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,190
I had to work crazy jobs to buy them from a reseller.

419
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:26,910
Super cool, aren't they?

420
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:29,650
Don't touch.
Hey, this isn't for touching.

421
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:32,080
Look with your eyes. So cool, huh?

422
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,870
Oh Ma Hui Yeong.

423
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:38,710
Is the midterm prep going well?

424
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,070
Ignoring me.

425
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:47,350
Just you wait, Ma Hui Yeong!

426
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:50,710
I'll take that first place of yours.

427
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:55,950
That punk Sang Hoon. That clown.

428
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,440
Don't pay any attention to him.

429
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,170
Look. As you can see, the lengths of the two diagonals

430
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:08,880
are 5 and 8. What does that mean? This has to be 5.

431
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,950
And this has to be 8.

432
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:13,850
The angle with the diagonal is 60 degrees.

433
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:20,100
Then find the area of quadrilateral A, B, C, and D.
Now, let's see.

434
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:24,090
Look at them. All lovey-dovey.

435
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,770
A, B, C, D...

436
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,990
The area is...

437
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,470
Choi Joon Woo is dying of happiness.

438
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:38,120
Kids were saying he stared at Ro Mi all the time.
I can see that it was true.

439
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,650
Of course, all men are the same.
Everyone except my Oh Je.

440
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:44,370
Twenty times the square root of 3, so...

441
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:48,000
Isn't this the first time Ro Mi's smiled like that
and looked so happy?

442
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,230
It's weird.

443
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:54,330
I know.
Ro Mi, that ice queen, is smiling from ear to ear.

444
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:58,120
Study, study.
The test is right around the corner!

445
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:11,270
Choi Joon Woo, do you like her that much?

446
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:15,850
Soo Bin, why would you say that?

447
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:18,100
Why, why, why?

448
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:25,110
Yoon Pil Sang, stop joking around.

449
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,860
Okay.

450
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:30,960
Did you fall asleep?

451
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,750
- Does it hurt?
- Are you are okay?

452
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:53,160
I have a feeling we’re in charge of more and more areas.

453
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,670
Gi Tae decided who cleans which areas.

454
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,800
It might be because of me.

455
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,670
Maybe. Let’s just accept it.

456
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:12,600
The math teacher must be really scared of Hui Yeoung.

457
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:18,170
Sang Hoon is the math teacher’s favorite.

458
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:21,890
They have to meet behind Hui Yeong’s
back because he’s so jealous.

459
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,040
Come on, you’re good at this.

460
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,140
Give me this. I'll go inside.

461
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:36,750
Hui Yeong, I'll do it.

462
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:39,260
Go study.

463
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,060
Thanks.

464
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,120
Good work.

465
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,260
Where is Ma Hui Yeong Sunbae?

466
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:06,070
Hui Yeong? Why?

467
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,700
Hui Yeong, the math teacher
is calling for you at the math office.

468
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,100
Sang Hoon, amazing.
If I teach you one thing, you understand ten more.

469
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,920
This is why I like you.

470
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,320
Teach, your favorite is Ma Hui Yeong, though.

471
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,320
You're the best student.
Do you really not know how I feel?

472
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,970
So just switch to STEM (science, tech, math).

473
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:34,460
Go to STEM and get first place, a math genius like you.

474
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,750
You, that'll be so much easier for you!

475
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,190
Teach,

476
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:41,010
I definitely won't let Ma Hui Yeong be first place here.

477
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:43,490
- You're joking, right?
- No, I'm serious.

478
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:48,320
You have no idea how much fun
it is to trample bit by bit on Hui Yeong.

479
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,930
I'm saying this because I really cherish you.

480
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,870
Oh, Hui Yeong.

481
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,120
You called me.

482
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,250
I did?

483
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:01,760
No, I didn't. I would have messaged you
if I wanted to call you.

484
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:07,890
I had something to ask him while solving this but
I got stuck. You already finished it, right?

485
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:09,920
Of course, you're first place, Ma Hui Yeong.

486
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,250
I'm hella jealous.

487
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,880
Speak nicely.

488
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:17,250
I'm sorry to disturb you.

489
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:19,190
Hey. You're the best student.
Do you really not know how I feel?

490
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:22,530
Teach, I definitely won't let Ma Hui Yeong
be first place here.

491
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:27,680
You have no idea how much fun
it is to trample bit by bit on Hui Yeong?

492
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,260
Just wait, Ma Hui Yeong.

493
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:32,320
I'll make it so I steal your first place.

494
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:55,090
Your heart feels like it's going to burst, right?

495
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:58,950
Jealousy. Feeling uneasy.

496
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:01,020
You had this kind of illness.

497
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:07,400
An illness where you have to get rid of the
most treasured possession of the person who makes you mad.

498
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,800
What is this, Choi Joon Woo?

499
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,140
Stop joking around.

500
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:18,610
Joking?
Was stealing that teacher's watch also a joke?

501
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,840
And blaming me for it.

502
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:25,500
And doing things to make me get kicked out of this school.
Were they jokes, too?

503
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,610
This punk is making up things that didn't even happen.

504
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:30,270
Do you know why you're doing these things?

505
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:35,450
To you, only you are precious.

506
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:38,120
Nothing else matters,

507
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:44,270
because you can't stand the things that
don't matter being in your way.

508
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:56,000
Choi Joon Woo, you have a great imagination.

509
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,700
So? So what are you going to do?

510
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:03,430
Spread rumors about me and my flaws through
the things you're imagining, and then what?

511
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:06,020
Are you going to embarrass me?

512
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:09,850
No. I'm going to make you feel sorry

513
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:15,550
about the things you thought didn't matter,
to make you sorry about thinking that.

514
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,120
You don't even matter.

515
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,100
Oh Hui—

516
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,910
I called him.

517
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,110
You have to put that away, too.

518
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:32,630
Just like you put that teacher's watch into my locker.

519
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:57,980
I hate this.

520
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:01,280
Exam season is here!

521
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,100
My condition isn't even good.

522
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,230
Me either.

523
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:08,620
Yoo Soo Bin.
You made me fail the level test didn't you?

524
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:09,540
What?

525
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:12,130
Heol, you failed the test?

526
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:15,650
You saw me telling the teacher
that I won't be going to the tutoring center.

527
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:17,430
Then your mom?

528
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:20,140
Your mom didn't know you quit the class.

529
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:21,510
Ro Mi!

530
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:23,260
Fight?

531
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:27,250
Aren't you being too harsh?

532
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:29,160
Then why did I fail?

533
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,960
Why did I fail something you passed?!

534
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,220
Maybe you didn't do well!

535
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,940
What?!

536
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:35,970
Stop. Why are you fighting?

537
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:38,030
Move.

538
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:39,410
Oh my gosh.

539
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:40,320
Unbelievable.

540
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,540
Why did I fail?

541
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,810
I'm so dizzy.

542
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:50,010
Oh my gosh, she's making a show.

543
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:54,700
- Hey! Soo Bin.
- Hey!

544
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,680
Oh my...

545
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:15,900
Soo Bin! Soo Bin!

546
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,210
I understand you.

547
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:26,190
You know Ro Mi is that kind of girl.

548
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:30,930
I knew she'd be like that.
She's the one who didn't do well on the level exam.

549
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:36,680
Why am I being like this?

550
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:39,570
You held it in so well, why are you being like this?

551
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,790
It's not the first day she's acting like this.

552
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:44,080
I regret it.

553
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:48,250
Regret what?
That you left the tutoring center?

554
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:49,180
No.

555
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:52,390
That you fought with your mom?

556
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:55,330
I don't know. My heart is heavy.

557
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:57,940
My heart is heavy.

558
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:04,160
Cheer up.

559
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:12,490
Ma Hui Yeong

560
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:21,520
The most important person to Lee Gi Tae is Ma Hui Yeong.

561
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:32,620
2-3 Homeroom Teacher

562
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:40,470
Hello Ma'am, this is Oh Han Gyeol.
Sorry to keep calling you.

563
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:44,500
Is it still hard to get in contact with Teacher Kim?

564
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,420
Is he very sick?

565
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:50,540
It's nothing but I wanted to ask about the kids in the classroom...

566
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:52,860
H-Hello?

567
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:56,940
Yes, yes, I will call again.

568
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:28,890
It's definitely exam season since Ma Hui Yeong is here early.

569
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,310
This environment is so suffocating.

570
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:20,470
Hi.

571
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:45,570
The notes I cleaned up.

572
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,860
You already got this far?

573
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:53,900
Give it to me after you're done using it.

574
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:57,510
I have mine too. I cleaned this one up
while I was doing mine

575
00:48:57,510 --> 00:48:58,870
to give it to you.

576
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:00,870
Really?

577
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:03,740
So Ye.

578
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:06,480
Let's do well on this exam.

579
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:08,640
Thanks Gi Tae.

580
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,090
Wait.

581
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:25,060
What are you watching?

582
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:26,800
Oh my gosh.

583
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,710
I can't focus because of you.

584
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:32,520
I'm sorry.

585
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:06,340
Hello.

586
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:08,590
Mom!

587
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:10,440
Joon Woo!

588
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,540
Mom, why...

589
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,090
And what's this?

590
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:22,390
You have exams starting tomorrow.
I want you to study hard for the exams.

591
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:25,020
Your mother wants to work instead of you,

592
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:29,680
so she has pestered the boss for three hours.

593
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:36,790
Hey. You need to get your grades up in this exam.

594
00:50:36,790 --> 00:50:39,950
You need to get high scores to show
to the people who belittled you.

595
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:43,030
Of course.

596
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:44,110
What about your work at the restaurant?

597
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:47,650
Well, I just got some days off.

598
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:50,530
Joon Woo, go and study.

599
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:54,590
No. Should we go and register you for an academy?

600
00:50:54,590 --> 00:51:00,740
Right!
There are academies that do preparations for midterm exams.

601
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:04,450
Let's go.
First, let's go to an academy.

602
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:08,900
Mother! It's your shift though.

603
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:12,280
Then first, you go study. Okay?

604
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,120
Go. Go. Go.

605
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:16,370
Go.

606
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:18,750
Go on.

607
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:24,500
What should I do first?

608
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:25,740
Should we try again?

609
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:28,480
The one we did earlier. Again.

610
00:51:35,850 --> 00:51:37,440
Mom is just...

611
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:54,560
Yoo Soo Bin.

612
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,450
Fighting!

613
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,910
Have some ginseng.

614
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:15,910
You promised this time that you
would get first place in math.

615
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:18,100
She's so focused.

616
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:38,000
Math.

617
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,400
First place.

618
00:52:57,190 --> 00:53:00,710
Confirm your markings for the last time.

619
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:06,000
The last person collects the sheets.

620
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:26,060
Hui Yeoung, what are you doing?

621
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:28,030
Teacher, just a minute.

622
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:30,640
I told you to wait!

623
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,170
I need to get your answer sheets.

624
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:34,500
Wait.

625
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,620
Hui Yeong, what are you doing?

626
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:38,740
Please wait, Sir.

627
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:41,720
I said to wait!

628
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:49,500
Father.

629
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:52,690
I told you I will kill you if you miss
being the first place in the whole school.

630
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:54,550
Hui Yeong!

631
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:58,280
Can you even sleep?

632
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:02,840
You sleep all the sleep you can get and
you think you can keep being the first place?

633
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:07,010
Hui Yeong has been working hard until now.

634
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:08,820
He's just resting for a while.

635
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:11,310
Pathetic people.

636
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:15,700
Since I work like a dog to have you live comfortably,

637
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:18,410
you just sleep comfortably.

638
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:20,080
Right outside the doors,

639
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:24,950
there are tons of people out
there who are trying to get what is mine.

640
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:27,640
Aren't you going to get it together?

641
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:31,130
Just you dare miss being first in the whole school.

642
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:34,890
I will kick you out of this house naked.

643
00:54:54,270 --> 00:54:55,850
Hui Yeong!
No. Don't scratch.

644
00:54:55,850 --> 00:54:57,520
Don't scratch.

645
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,570
Don't scratch.

646
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:30,110
I need to do well in math.
I promised Mom.

647
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:33,960
And I need to prove my skills.

648
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:37,850
What's wrong with you, Yoo Soo Bin?

649
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:41,120
Get it together.

650
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:44,030
Soo Bin, are you sick?

651
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:51,200
Teacher, can I go to the clinic for a bit?

652
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,590
Clinic? Let's go.

653
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:00,120
Soo Bin! What to do?

654
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:03,560
Quiet! It's an exam.
Take your seats.

655
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:04,530
Are you alright?

656
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:06,590
Teacher, I'll carry her.

657
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:20,820
Here.

658
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:31,660
Solve the problems.

659
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:43,580
Quiet! Focus on the exam.

660
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,740
My exam...

661
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:50,220
Teacher, what about Soo Bin's exam?
She probably hasn't finished answering everything.

662
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:53,240
I know. There's still 20 minutes left.

663
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:56,740
Can she perhaps take it in the clinic?

664
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:58,310
I heard that's allowed.

665
00:56:58,310 --> 00:57:01,220
We can do that.
I will go get the papers so go ahead.

666
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:03,040
Okay.

667
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:08,190
Don't worry.
You will be fine after you take some medication.

668
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:10,200
You can continue with the exam.

669
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:13,100
It's warm... Choi Joon Hoo's back.

670
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:16,750
I thought it wouldn't be, but it's warm.

671
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,740
- Teach.
- What's wrong?

672
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:31,600
Your stomach is hurting?

673
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,540
Let’s see.

674
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:37,350
Wait.

675
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,610
It seems like it's acute gastric cramps.

676
00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:43,700
Wait a bit.

677
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,460
Joon Woo, hurry and solve this.

678
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:51,650
I'm fine though.

679
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:54,380
Are you not a student?

680
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:34,780
Did you solve it all?

681
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:39,430
Joon Woo's and Soo Bin's.

682
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:43,610
I will give this to the math teacher so just stay here.

683
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:10,990
Are you alright?

684
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:14,780
Yeah. Thank you.

685
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:19,010
You even missed some of the exam time.
What to do? I'm sorry.

686
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:23,880
You don't have to be.
I didn't know how to do the problems at the back.

687
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:33,220
You can go now. I can manage by myself.

688
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:35,610
I will once the nurse comes back.

689
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:39,070
Are you uncomfortable?

690
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:43,560
Then I will go.

691
00:59:57,930 --> 01:00:00,120
You... your hand.

692
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:06,290
Did it happen before?
I didn't know.

693
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:11,540
You should have that treated by the nurse.
That might get worse.

694
01:00:12,970 --> 01:00:15,190
It's okay though.

695
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:17,430
Get it treated.

696
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:22,360
Should I?

697
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:45,810
That... the thing I said before.

698
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:47,820
What did I say?

699
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:54,140
Beom Bi... when your bike broke...

700
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:58,330
The thing I said before it broke.

701
01:00:58,330 --> 01:01:00,190
Just... forget—

702
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:02,320
I also...

703
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:03,760
Huh?

704
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,190
I was going to tell you this last time.

705
01:01:06,190 --> 01:01:11,900
That's why... I know what you are about to say.

706
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:19,340
Why?

707
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:21,200
I want to drink water.

708
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,020
- I will get it for you.
- No.

709
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:24,820
It's okay.

710
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:35,890
Just... pressured... don't be.

711
01:01:35,890 --> 01:01:41,490
You can... just forget everything.

712
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:43,660
I like you.

713
01:01:55,790 --> 01:01:59,050
I like you. I do too.

714
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:13,750
I like you.

715
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:22,180
♬ Like a precious memory of a very long time ago ♬

716
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:26,320
♬ It is still here. ♬

717
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:29,810
♬ Although I was one step too far away, I know ♬

718
01:02:29,810 --> 01:02:32,510
Moment at Eighteen
~ Preview ~

719
01:02:32,510 --> 01:02:35,570
Sir, the kid that carried Soo Bin on his back,
I think I saw him before.

720
01:02:35,570 --> 01:02:36,680
That kid who was forced to transfer--

721
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:37,600
Just, just transferred.

722
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,600
Why did he help you?
Why are you always tangled up with him?

723
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,440
Don't have him beside you.

724
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,320
The correct answer is number two.

725
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:46,090
It's just one question so don't be so bothered about it.

726
01:02:46,090 --> 01:02:47,690
What do you know?

727
01:02:47,690 --> 01:02:51,050
I have thought about it.
I will just accept your feelings.

728
01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:52,990
Let's date.

729
01:02:52,990 --> 01:02:55,650
Scissors, rock, paper.

730
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:57,760
Yoo Soo Bin, you're just like a bean.

731
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,620
A really small one.

732
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:01,620
Yoo Soo Bin.

733
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:05,140
♬ The day on which a small door opened ♬

734
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:10,600
Hello, I am Choi Joon Woo.

735
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:14,630
♬ was all about my feeling of happiness ♬
