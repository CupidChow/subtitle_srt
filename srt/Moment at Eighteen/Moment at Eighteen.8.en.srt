1
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,100
Hello, I am Choi Joon Woo.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,160
I'm in the same class as Soo Bin.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,500
I know. And?

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,990
- I...
- Cha Joon Woo, um,

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,680
I have to go somewhere quickly.
I'll see you at school. Let's go, Mom.

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,080
Wait.

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,830
May I briefly talk with Soo Bin?

8
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,720
What about?

9
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,990
I have something I have to speak to her about.

10
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:47,500
Oh, about the research material?
I already got them from Chan Yeol this morning.

11
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,590
You did?

12
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,080
That... You know, literature performance assessment?
We're in the same group.

13
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,350
He must have come by to give it to me.

14
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,520
Why come all this way for that?

15
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,950
That's...

16
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:18,190
I was in the area, and Soo Bin was nearby so I came.

17
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,550
Then you're done, right?

18
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,090
Yes.

19
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,650
- Let's go.
- Yeah, w-we should go.

20
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,070
Let's go.

21
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,220
Good bye.

22
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,100
I guess your plan failed.
I don't know what it's about, but...

23
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,820
Why did he come?

24
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,390
- Ro Mi hasn't left yet.
- Wait for me.

25
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,490
Are they dating?

26
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:17,460
Why does she like someone like that?
What if her parents find out?

27
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,400
They're not dating.

28
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,190
What do you mean?
You can tell just by looking.

29
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:25,770
If I was her mother, I'd go insane, dating a kid like that.

30
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,050
Why are you in the same group?
It'll bring your average down.

31
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,520
The teacher did it.

32
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,100
Why of all people?

33
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,920
If it was Hui Yeong's mom,
she would have gone to the school.

34
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,540
What were you going to talk to Soo Bin about?

35
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,370
No way, a confession?

36
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,690
In front of her mom?

37
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,780
If you really did, that would have been amazing.

38
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,550
She would have fainted foaming at the mouth.

39
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,170
I'll be going.

40
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,460
How dare you like someone
when you can't even confidently confess?

41
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,690
You don't even have the courage.

42
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,570
Epiosde 8
The Moment of First Love

43
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,210
It makes you sigh, too, right?

44
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,600
Oh, I'm so scared.
Why are kids so smart?

45
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,170
What do I do about Soo Bin?

46
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,100
We have several consultants working with each student.

47
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,780
And we prepare for any changes that might happen.

48
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,510
Also this is...

49
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,000
I have something I have to speak to her about.

50
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,600
Oh, about the research material?

51
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,090
I see.

52
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:13,960
Confession, follow-up action, timing, that wasn't the issue.

53
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,790
Am I just not good enough?

54
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,830
Why is liking her so complicated?

55
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,970
An open class?

56
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,810
Oh, I believe we already had one
at the beginning of the semester.

57
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,490
I am asking specially for junior class 3.

58
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:42,080
Your English class.

59
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,380
She has no faith in me, huh?

60
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,860
No...

61
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,070
This is the chance to...

62
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,670
Welc—

63
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,550
Come here!

64
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,450
What brings you here?

65
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,960
Wow. What's going on?

66
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,530
Wow, amazing!

67
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:22,170
What's all this? Teach Oh!

68
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:25,820
- You're working hard.
- Yes. You can't step on it.

69
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:29,680
Oh, some things are worth learning.

70
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,500
Now.

71
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,160
Okay.

72
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,160
I can do it, Han Gyeol.

73
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,300
Oh, this is my chance to show the mothers.

74
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,390
Now, I can do it!

75
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,140
I can...

76
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:12,430
Don't depend on these things.
You can do it.

77
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,230
I can do it. I can do it!

78
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,960
Now... I can...

79
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:58,100
I can... I'm sure I can... do it.

80
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,930
I can do it.

81
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,870
Hello.

82
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,960
You came?

83
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:26,070
Wait! Wait for me!

84
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,630
You're mothers of grade 2, class 3, right?

85
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:34,160
Oh, I'm the mother of Choi Joon Woo
who transferred this semester. Nice to meet you.

86
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,340
Hello. We met before.

87
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,910
Yes. Hello.

88
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:07,080
Hello. I'm Oh Jae's father.

89
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,960
I see.

90
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,200
Are you nervous?

91
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,740
Chocolate and...

92
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,540
Ro Mi.

93
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,190
Joon Woo. Joon Woo.

94
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,290
I didn't think she knew about this.

95
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:42,110
Your mom is really young and pretty.

96
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,560
Oh, what about your mom?

97
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,180
My mom can't come because of Oh Dong, and dad is...

98
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,400
Father!

99
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,930
Da Huin!

100
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,110
It's a good thing your mom isn't here.

101
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,920
Oh, she should have the meeting of families (before marriage).

102
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,400
Please wake up, Kwon Da Huin.

103
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,070
Ro Mi, is your mom coming?

104
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,950
She went to a conference in Stockholm.

105
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,170
Good morning everyone.

106
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,330
Hello, mothers and father.

107
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,690
Oh, Pil Sang, your...

108
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,380
Coming to our grade 2, class 3's open class,

109
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,840
I welcome you! Welcome!

110
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,030
I guess Oh Han Gyeol is super nervous.

111
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:38,130
Totally manic.

112
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:41,250
Here we go!

113
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,420
Ah, Teach, just be yourself. It's weird.

114
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,540
- I agree.
- I think so, right?

115
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:54,460
Oh, now then we'll begin the class.

116
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:58,970
The bell rang, you have to get back to class.

117
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:02,230
So, therefore,

118
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,590
the answer is number 2.

119
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:12,410
But you see, the answer could be number 2,

120
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,660
but depending on how you interpret it,
it could be number 4.

121
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:21,090
The mistake can be made because of
a wording used in this instance, but--

122
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,370
Teach...

123
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,640
Just apologize,

124
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,340
that you're embarrassed toward me.

125
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,000
If you interpret this text, it's asking
whether the people who lead this society

126
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,890
are those who rank high in their grades.

127
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:48,510
The answer is it's important that
we cultivate diversified groups of people to—

128
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:52,830
No, no, no.
The point of this article is clear.

129
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:57,510
It's the top 1% of the population that leads society,

130
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:03,490
and we need to make an effort to be a part of that 1%.

131
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,370
Hui Yeong, let's speak Korean.

132
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,490
Why? I like the high-level lesson.

133
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:13,950
Even we can understand what's going on.

134
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:16,440
Yes. Yes.

135
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,620
History was always written by the top 1%.

136
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:30,680
If we don't become a part of the ruling class,
we will end up leading sad little life.

137
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,130
As I expected, the teacher's level doesn't match the students'.

138
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:39,750
That's why streaming classes (Grouping students by ability)
are so important. They start at different levels.

139
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:45,610
Well done Hui Yeong.
Your English is excellent.

140
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:49,570
Your pronunciation is absolutely perfect.

141
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:53,390
But, this class is not a stage for you

142
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:59,180
to show off how great you are. Right?

143
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:03,260
I think we had enough to hear your English speaking.

144
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:08,110
Since we have parents as our guests here,

145
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:15,640
it's better that everyone participate equally in class.

146
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,590
Do you understand?

147
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:24,020
Oh Han Gyeol can speak English!
That's an unexpected twist.

148
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:31,240
Oh, so any other questio—
Oh, I keep speaking in English.

149
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,610
Now, anyone with another opinion?

150
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,140
How about Joon Woo?

151
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,830
Oh, yes.

152
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:53,640
As you all know, the vice president
position of our class was unfilled.

153
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:58,510
But Choi Joon Woo has been chosen
as the vice president of our class.

154
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:03,550
Now, let's cheer him on with applause.

155
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:08,410
- Congratulations, Joon Woo.
- Congratulations, Son! He's my son.

156
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,300
Forced transfer student.

157
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,670
I...

158
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,740
oppose that opinion.

159
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:26,160
Who runs the world?

160
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:40,400
Of course, the top 1% does lead our society,

161
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:47,850
but that doesn't mean the other 99% are losers.

162
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:54,340
To be honest, that standard was stipulated
by the establishment

163
00:13:54,340 --> 00:14:01,310
at school, through grades, in society, through wealth,
position. Those types of things.

164
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:06,680
So the talent that forms society cannot be
decided upon through those simple figures,

165
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:12,060
and in education also, it should be equal
and varied so that everyone can find their talents

166
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:16,900
and help so that those people can aid society.

167
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,600
Wow, wow. That's a great thought.

168
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:31,070
Then now, using Joon Woo's opinion as the basis. How about we write an English composition with an opposing opinion?

169
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,900
No.

170
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:37,050
We like it a lot.

171
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,350
Choi Joon Woo, you're amazing.
How do you know it so well?

172
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:45,920
Like it was calculated.

173
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:51,840
I know, right?
Like it was calculated.

174
00:14:51,840 --> 00:15:00,760
Joon Woo, I'm going to ask you tomorrow at the open class,
so just say what's written here.

175
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:10,200
I oppose Hui Yeong's opinion.
What's he going to say?

176
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:15,460
I don't know, but he'll probably say something
that's the opposite of what's written here.

177
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:22,900
- What if he doesn't?
- He will. Trust me.

178
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:29,740
Hey, Joon Woo, let's be honest.

179
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:35,570
When the mothers come tomorrow,
won't there be a lot of unnecessary talk about you?

180
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:42,050
You have to show them something of top
quality as a vice president!

181
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:45,590
But faking it like this, my conscience...

182
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:52,150
Look here, kid, sometimes you need these types of skills.

183
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:01,750
Just memorize this, no matter what, okay?

184
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,440
Oh, Mom, my best friend, Oh Jae.

185
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:29,660
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you. I'm Lee Yeon Woo, his mother.

186
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,900
- That's because of his father.
- Soo Bin, you speak a bit of English, right?

187
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,770
Oh, they're almost pros.

188
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:41,100
Oh Jae because you're the fifth child (Oh is homonym for five)?

189
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,000
Not because of that, but...

190
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,320
Oh, Joon Woo, Oh Jae.
You made a lot of effort.

191
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,820
You worked hard.

192
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,350
Can I have a minute with Joon Woo?

193
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:54,820
- Ro Mi.
- Move.

194
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:59,870
Ro Mi?
I'm Pil Sang's mom.

195
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:05,290
- I heard you're his girlfriend.
- Yes?
- And your father is the head of a hospital?

196
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:10,550
Our levels are on par. We have a huge leasing business.

197
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:16,380
Once Pil Sang graduates high school, we're thinking
about letting him get married. You're ready for it, right?

198
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:22,640
- Ready?
- Oh, right. You know Pil Sang is the third generation only son, right?

199
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,710
Hey, Pil Sang!

200
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:30,480
That fiery temper is just like mine.

201
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,050
Joon Woo. You did well.
You did.

202
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:42,420
You did well. So, so great.

203
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:46,530
Well... thanks to you.
Thank you.

204
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:50,170
Well, well, not in the least bit—
yes and no, right?

205
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:54,990
Well, that's how it begins, no?
The path of an in-crowd?

206
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,740
No, that's overdoing it.

207
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:00,350
I'll be going.

208
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:09,610
Oh, you know the person who works with you at the store?

209
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:12,900
Oh, you mean the late-shift ahjussi who came with me last time?

210
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:17,270
- Um, yeah. He's well, right?
- Yeah well, he's well.

211
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,130
That's good then.

212
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,720
- Why?
- It's nothing.

213
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,600
I'll get going.

214
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,280
We met before, right?

215
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,270
- The bar!
- That pathetic—

216
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:52,780
- Oh, you live around here?
- No, I work here part-time.

217
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:59,600
I see. Oh, Joon Woo!
You know him, right? I'm his homeroom teacher.

218
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:05,400
- Who?
- Joon Woo.
- Oh, Park Yeong Bae?

219
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:11,570
But I'm a little late for my evening shift.
I'll see you next time.

220
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:14,790
Why do I keep thinking about her?

221
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,840
She's cute.

222
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,560
Joon Woo! You know him, right?
I'm his homeroom teacher.

223
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:29,720
Park Yeong Bae's homeroom teacher?
That pathetic guy was a teacher?

224
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,400
Oh, totally not my style.

225
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:34,460
Wow, I thought there was a flood (sweating).

226
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:38,180
- Because your grandma was watching?
- You know I'm the perfect granddaughter.

227
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:42,330
I couldn't speak once in class today
and my grandma was so disappointed.

228
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:44,470
You should've worked harder.

229
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:46,440
And he put down Ma Hui Yeong like that.

230
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,220
Oh Je!

231
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,390
Let's talk.

232
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,230
After lunch.

233
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,320
No. Right now.

234
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:12,130
Go ahead and eat first.

235
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,560
What? Did Soo Bin borrow money from Choi Joon Woo?

236
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,860
- Right?
- Sorry, sorry.

237
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,070
I'm not the only one feeling it.

238
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,420
Choi Joon Woo!

239
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,150
Soo Bin. Where are you going?

240
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:45,480
Choi Joon Woo wanted to meet with me.

241
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,550
The others are over there. Go eat with them.

242
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,290
Sorry.

243
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:15,360
About what?

244
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,080
That day.

245
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:22,220
No, I'm sorry for that day.

246
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:25,250
You even came to my house.

247
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,200
No, not that day.

248
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,930
That day.

249
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,650
When I couldn't get back to you.

250
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:39,900
The day I confessed to you.

251
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:46,730
I wanted to contact you afterward, but my phone...

252
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:51,000
So I went to your house, too.

253
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,600
Just...

254
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,060
It was my first time, so I didn't know how to act.

255
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,670
First...

256
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,010
What was your first time?

257
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,040
Saying...

258
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,760
to someone...

259
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,740
Saying I liked someone...

260
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:26,570
Sit. Sit, sit, sit. Face the front.

261
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:29,250
I'll just sit here. Just look straight ahead.

262
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:39,000
Joon Woo! Joon Woo!

263
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:44,560
What does he keep looking at?

264
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,940
The stray must have come back.
There's a cat that follows Joon Woo around.

265
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,920
Really? I should ask him about it.

266
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,420
Do you like cats?

267
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,660
Of course, I raise two at home.

268
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,500
Would you like to see?

269
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,970
This one is Blackie,

270
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:03,430
- and this is...
- I'm sorry, but I should catch up.

271
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,560
- Oh. Right.
- Alright.

272
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,000
Wait for me!

273
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,830
Have the mothers gone down?

274
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:12,630
Not yet. They're walking slowly.

275
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:17,530
I'll leave first for now.

276
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,900
Soo Bin.

277
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,280
Later.

278
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,890
Tell me later.

279
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,240
I lost five years of my life.

280
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,350
Do you want to watch a movie?

281
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,530
This Saturday.

282
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:43,190
If there's something you want to watch, tell me.
I'll buy the tickets.

283
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,760
Damn.

284
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:54,790
Anyway, contact me.

285
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:06,220
What about Ro Mi?
I thought you were going out with her.

286
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:09,130
I hate two-timing guys the most.

287
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,410
I'm not a two-timer,

288
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:17,700
and I'm not dating her.

289
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,570
I have no interest in Hwang Ro Mi. At all.

290
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:25,330
There is only one person

291
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,220
whom I really like.

292
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,770
Contact me.

293
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:45,160
Only one person.

294
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,460
Hey.

295
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,530
What? What is it?

296
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,530
The parents left.

297
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,680
I should have recorded it.
I keep getting confused.

298
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,240
No, Soo Bin. This is real.

299
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,440
Real. True life.

300
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,780
Ro Mi.

301
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,490
Did something good happen?

302
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:22,440
Huh? No, not really.

303
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,090
I had a lot of lunch.

304
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:26,830
What did you talk about with Choi Joon Woo?

305
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:33,970
- Ro Mi, there's something I have to tell you.
- Soo Bin.

306
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:36,700
I have a problem. Can I tell you about it?

307
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,070
Later, after school.

308
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,520
Yeah.

309
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,960
There's no know-how.
As much effort as I put into it. That's all.

310
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:51,800
You know the saying, the child's grade
and level are the mother's life grade.

311
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,000
Right. Gi Tae needs to succeed for me to succeed.

312
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,130
I've been running around all the time while working.
I don't know what I'm doing!

313
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:01,170
Seriously, I don't know what it means to work to live.

314
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:05,800
How can someone who came out of Seoul University say that?

315
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,010
High-class people like Soo Bin's mom

316
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:11,370
need to give back to society with all their capabilities.

317
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,350
That is how our nation can develop.

318
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,540
What do you mean by high class?

319
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:19,000
Please take good care of this working mom with many flaws.

320
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,230
- I'm sucking up.
- Oh my.

321
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:23,000
What? Seriously.

322
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:29,490
But, you are so young.

323
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:32,570
I'm sorry, but what year did you graduate?

324
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:35,570
I didn't graduate from university.

325
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,200
I'm thirty-seven.

326
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,770
Things happened and I had Joon Woo a little early.

327
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,760
You played around.

328
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,420
Right?

329
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:51,330
That's why your son is such a free-spirit.

330
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:56,100
You know, we should have something
like a parental rights test.

331
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:00,340
Just because you give birth to a child
doesn't make you a parent.

332
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:04,400
Why? Do I seem undeserving to be a mother?

333
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,120
- in which areas?
- Oh, Soo Bin's dad is coming back soon, right?

334
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,070
He's a visiting professor, no?

335
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:11,800
- Excuse me.
- We think he'll be back by summer vacation.

336
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:16,340
You and your husband have amazing resumes.
How lucky!

337
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:19,520
What's the point of that?
Our kid has to study well,

338
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,250
like Hui Yeong.

339
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,940
That's true. There's a saying like this, too.

340
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:30,540
People can only rely on their children after the age of 40.

341
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,840
It's all on the kids.

342
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,670
Yeah, you'll have to pick at me to feel satisfied, you raccoon.

343
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:40,440
Your own luck has to follow.

344
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,800
You're so right.

345
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,050
It's true.

346
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:48,460
Hello. Hello.

347
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,660
Aren't you Department Head Jo's son?

348
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:55,510
Yes. I came because I had something to tell you.

349
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:59,420
Hold on. You think the math teacher we just barely...

350
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,940
You think we persuaded him to mark all the answers correct?

351
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,350
Yes.

352
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:09,090
So return everything to normal.
Then I'll let it slide.

353
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:11,810
Let it... Let what slide?

354
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,120
Sang Hoon. Department Head Jo...

355
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,290
Your father is working well at our company
due to my husband. You know that, right?

356
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:25,690
- So as his child—
- I don't know about things like that.

357
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:28,440
Just put everything back to its normal state.

358
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,060
Original state.

359
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,140
I don't know what you're talking about.

360
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,870
Forget it. Go.

361
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:36,630
I know everything.

362
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:39,300
Hui Yeong stole the watch from Teacher Son.

363
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,390
He then put it on Choi Joon Woo.

364
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:45,650
There's also more stuff you've covered for him in the past.

365
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:48,640
I have the evidence saved as well.

366
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:55,100
Are you threatening me right now?

367
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,330
It's a negotiation.

368
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:04,140
Since you're viewing it as a threat,
you must feel a little unsettled.

369
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,240
What is this rude kid saying right now?

370
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,830
That's why.

371
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,300
I'll ask you to turn things back to normal.

372
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:23,250
- What?
- My mom told me Jo Sang Hoon is talking to your mom right now.

373
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:27,010
I think it's about math test question number 15.

374
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:37,130
Madame, welcome home.

375
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,820
That preposterous bastard.

376
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:11,720
It's me.
Don't hang up. It's about Hui Yeong.

377
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:17,170
They're all so well-off. Childish poops!

378
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:24,290
Okay. From now on, I'm also going to be a passionate mom.

379
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:28,770
What can I not do if it's for Joon Woo?

380
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:33,190
What did you want to talk about?

381
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,830
I like Choi Joon Woo.

382
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:40,930
I don't know why I like him.

383
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:45,670
He's not overwhelmingly smart or from a rich family.

384
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:48,030
Funny, isn't it?

385
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,350
The truth is, my family has a lot of tension these days.

386
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:57,990
My parents are arguing, and my dad's hospital isn't doing well.

387
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:01,040
My grades are dropping, too.

388
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:08,700
I always get annoyed.
But when I see Choi Joon Woo, I feel, how should I put it...

389
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:15,250
I feel better. Is that the right expression? Anyway,

390
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:27,920
it's like, when I'm in a bad mood walking home in the rain,
I find a pretty umbrella.

391
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:36,090
When I walk home with the umbrella,
I feel a lot better. It's like that.

392
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:43,730
Choi Joon Woo doesn't seem to like me back, though.

393
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:48,590
He seems to like someone else.
Do you know who?

394
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,250
The person Choi Joon Woo likes.

395
00:31:54,410 --> 00:32:01,270
I'm not sure. Should we order something else?
Maybe we'll feel better if we have something sweet.

396
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:04,380
Do you have concerns, too?

397
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,820
What are they

398
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,130
What was good here?

399
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:18,250
The brownies here are the best.

400
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,770
Hey! How long were you there?

401
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:30,890
Sorry. It wasn't on purpose.
I just wanted to take a nap.

402
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:35,920
But, what can we do?
I heard everything.

403
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:40,440
- Whoa.
- No way.

404
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:47,770
- No wonder. I felt something was up.
- That's why you ate that brownie like it was s**t.

405
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:52,940
What should I do? If Ro Mi finds out later,
she's going to be hurt. What should I do, guys?

406
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:56,260
Yoo Soo Bin. You should get hit first.

407
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,940
You had this phenomenal story
and you didn't even tell us. You traitor.

408
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:05,290
You have no sense of loyalty, you traitor.
Take that!

409
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:08,650
Hey, hey, hey, she'll get hurt.
Stop it. Grandma...

410
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:13,320
- Fine.
- Hit me. Hit me so I come to my senses. Hurry! Go crazy.

411
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:17,210
- Yoo Soo Bin. She's fallen deep.
- Yeah.

412
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:20,340
Hey, it's useless.

413
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,780
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

414
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:25,460
Goodbye.

415
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:39,500
Soo Bin, do you want to watch a movie?

416
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:50,370
Movie. Movie.

417
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:58,240
- How can you do this?
- Shh.

418
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,730
She seems like a pseudo cult leader.

419
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:08,280
What does it say?

420
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,280
- Check it.
- It's probably my mom. What do the cards say?

421
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:16,500
I said, check it. It's probably him.

422
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:21,300
I said it's my mom.

423
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:25,230
Did you pick the movie?
- Whoa.

424
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,950
Choi Joon Woo?

425
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:31,780
D-Did you pick the movie?

426
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:34,720
Whoa. I can't believe this.
Are you for real?

427
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,180
Wow! Is he naturally talented?

428
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,170
Hey!

429
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:48,360
Not yet.

430
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,170
You can take your time.

431
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:01,520
He said to take your time!

432
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:09,720
Unbelievable.
Hey, this is my first time seeing him act so considerately.

433
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,120
Are you working? Good luck.

434
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:23,830
- Another couple? Congratulations, Soo Bin.
- No, not yet, not yet.

435
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:27,000
What about Ro Mi?

436
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,310
What are the results?

437
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:34,620
Oh, um, I'm actually not too sure about what this card means.

438
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:40,990
- But, it's good.
- It is! The guys are dancing happily. And isn't that a firecracker?

439
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:47,750
- Yeah. This is good, right?
- Yeah, it is. Congratulations, Soo Bin!

440
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:51,420
- Congratulations.
- Ooh, congratulations.

441
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:06,320
- Sang Hoon.
- Dad. Forget about it? Did Ma Hui Yeong's dad tell you to say that?

442
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,810
Be quiet. Sit down.

443
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:14,220
It's because I'm in an awkward position.
If you change your thinking a little, it's not a big deal.

444
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:17,030
Why? Did he say he'd get you fired?

445
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:24,870
I might have to quit my job because of this,
so just hold it in this one time. Okay? Just once.

446
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:29,920
No. I can't do that.
Whether you get fired or not is not my business.

447
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,620
Sang Hoon!

448
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:38,080
- You can leave it. I'll clean up.
- Thank you.

449
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,830
Sang Hoon!

450
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:43,120
Sang Hoon!

451
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:51,970
So, in a word,
Teach, you are practically fired now.

452
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:55,180
It's not being fired. You are the top ace.

453
00:36:55,180 --> 00:37:00,040
I'm going to make another class.

454
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:06,130
I'm going to gather some honors students,
including you, from other schools.

455
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:10,420
Ma Hui Yeong's mom is really fast.
She reacted much faster than you.

456
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:13,710
Sang Hoon, that's not true.

457
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:19,950
I understand. I'll stop. Instead, don't put my name
in when you gather materials for a press release.

458
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:25,390
Just don't put my name on the list of students
accepted at Seoul National University. I am going to sue.

459
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:43,090
Hui Yeong. Sang Hoon is not going to apply
to Seoul National University.

460
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:45,880
- He said he applied.
- He really said it.

461
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:51,240
Hui Yeong, just play fair.
Let's see what you can do with your own skills.

462
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,870
- Doesn't she like you?
- What is there to like?

463
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:07,550
- Who said that? Who said she likes me?
- Then this is what she gave to you.

464
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:11,260
Hey. Keep it a secret.

465
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:14,570
I will just eat it.

466
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:24,210
President, please forgive him just this once.
I'll try to convince Sang Hoon again.

467
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:29,540
When the child thought he was going to convince her,
how did he dare to seek her out?

468
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:34,220
I heard he threatened her with fire in his eyes.
How dare he!

469
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:37,890
I'm sorry, Madame,
and I'm sorry, President.

470
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:44,100
Even so, the layoff order is...
my first daughter is studying abroad as you know.

471
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:47,780
Right now, she is the most important.

472
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:56,470
Please save me, President.
Please save me.

473
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:11,030
Oh, Sang Hoon. Apologize to Hui Yeong.

474
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:14,270
Dad, are you crazy? If I had gotten that right,
I would have been first in the whole school.

475
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:18,330
Sang Hoon, I'm satisfied with how well you're doing right now.

476
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:21,900
That's not the issue. It's about my pride!

477
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,710
Being that way to elders was wrong of you.

478
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:28,570
Is that what that Ma Hui Yeong bastard's mom said?
Does she even know how her son is?

479
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:31,960
- Sang Hoon, let's let this go. It's not a big deal.
- What do you mean it's not a big deal?

480
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:36,050
Don't you have any pride?
I'm going to expose everything.

481
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:41,200
For me, just bear it once more.

482
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,030
That's ridiculous bullshit, repeatedly.
Every day...

483
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:47,190
I am lacking.

484
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:52,510
- Dad, what are you lacking in?
- I'm sorry.

485
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:08,120
Oh, so you as the vice president of the class,

486
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,760
need to deliver three things to the classmates.

487
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:15,000
The goal is to raise academic performance by

488
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,920
encouraging class study activities
and studying all the subjects together.

489
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,790
Basically, let's get along with each other and study hard.

490
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:29,170
And organize a preparation committee for our field trip.

491
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:33,970
And when we get back from our field trip,
collect everyone's travel journals.

492
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,700
What?

493
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:41,910
Since you suddenly started explaining
how to run the class,

494
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:44,780
I think there's a lag in here.

495
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:47,250
Then take this and read it.

496
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,790
The vice-president shouldn't be like this, right?

497
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:56,710
What's wrong, right arm?

498
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,440
"Right arm" is a bit...

499
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,780
Anyway, what you need to tell the students
are these three things. Got it?

500
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:16,520
Hey, Sang Hoon!
Congratulations!

501
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:20,360
Sang Hoon's father will be transferred
to Singapore as branch manager.

502
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,960
- Sang Hoon, are you going too?
- Yes, ma'am.

503
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,690
It's like lightning roasting beans.

504
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,230
When is his last day coming to school?

505
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:29,880
That's a pity, Sang Hoon.

506
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,150
I will miss you, Teach.

507
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:40,590
Isn't he leaving because he couldn't make first place?

508
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:43,190
So what if he's leaving?
It doesn't matter if it turns out well.

509
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:47,830
- I'm jealous.
- If you're jealous, ask your parents to send you abroad. You have money.

510
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:50,640
I don't like leaving home, you know.

511
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,960
Hey, let's go eat lunch.

512
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:03,180
Go out.

513
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,320
Jo Sang Hoon.

514
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:26,420
Just pass by. I'm in a bad mood.

515
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:31,150
It's an about-face.
I thought you'd never give up.

516
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:34,380
How dare you say that, forced transfer student.

517
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:39,440
You are giving up though.

518
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,090
Where did you throw away that persistent
spirit to provoke and confront Ma Hui Yeong?

519
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:46,320
Shut up.

520
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,310
You don't even know anything.

521
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,470
I'm still here,

522
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,960
a forced transfer student.

523
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:01,450
That time, I also thought about running away.

524
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:04,560
But after toughing it out, I saw the way.

525
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:10,180
If I had run away that time,
I would've regretted it for a long time.

526
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:18,320
I don't feel any regrets, you know.

527
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,020
Go.

528
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,750
How about a round before you go?

529
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:25,500
With a pathetic transfer student, as a memory.

530
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:33,500
Starting on three. Okay?

531
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,420
No. When that passes by.

532
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:40,440
Where's it going? Hey!

533
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,970
Where are you going?
S-Singapore, damn it...

534
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:47,980
How many rounds?
One round? Two rounds?

535
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:54,670
♬ Everywhere I go you are always there with me ♬

536
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:59,680
♬ And I was always scared to face the truth ♬

537
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:04,200
♬ Now I’m still waiting right here for you to hold you ♬

538
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,590
- Jo Sang Hoon.
- What are you doing here?
- Did you really see him?

539
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:09,980
- What?
- Me stealing the watch at the academy?

540
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,390
- What?
- Did you see?

541
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:13,960
Damn it.

542
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,870
♬ we were young and fumbling ♬

543
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:20,920
♬ Everything fades away, let it go

544
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,460
That time, did you feel like it was unfair?

545
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:30,030
♬ Really wish I could stay, but you know me ♬

546
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:33,270
♬ All the moments we shared ♬

547
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:36,800
What is that?
Are they running again?

548
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:43,870
♬ Never quite understood it when you told me ♬

549
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:50,360
♬ Just close your eyes and I be right by your side ♬

550
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:58,140
♬ Cuz memories don’t say goodbye ♬

551
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:14,560
Oh, Hui Yeong.

552
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,000
The nurse was leaving earlier.

553
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:29,960
Now, shall I do it for you?

554
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:34,490
Hui Yeong, Hui Yeong. Hui Yeong, wait.

555
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,950
What? Are you scared?

556
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:51,800
Don't worry.
Whatever you take me for, I was an army medic.

557
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,090
Now.

558
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:56,160
- Ow.
- You startled me!

559
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,460
I didn't even touch it yet.

560
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,430
It hurts, it hurts.

561
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:04,720
Done.

562
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:12,370
There you go.

563
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:15,420
There you go, it's done.

564
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:20,230
Hui Yeong.

565
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:23,040
Are you tired?

566
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:30,630
If something is stressing you out
and you confide in me at least,

567
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:33,410
wouldn't that make the burden lighter?

568
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:41,430
Even if I didn't graduate in Seoul,
I'm pretty good in life counseling.

569
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:48,800
What do you know?
You didn't even graduate from Seoul University.

570
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,430
You didn't even graduate in Seoul,
so what do you know?

571
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:07,950
There's nothing tiring me out. Thank you.

572
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,130
All right.

573
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:21,870
Hui Yeong. Are you tired?

574
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:53,360
Sorry. Were you surprised?

575
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,640
No.

576
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:58,530
The class leader in learning has to be the strongest,
to always carry these around.

577
00:47:58,530 --> 00:48:00,390
I'm strong. Give it to me.

578
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:01,900
I'll take this just until there.

579
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:06,710
Did you decide on a movie?

580
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:08,670
I have to reserve the tickets now.

581
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:16,010
I tried to think about it, but...

582
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:19,960
Hey.

583
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:31,040
But why are we hiding?

584
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:41,420
Anyway, think about the movie and let me know.

585
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:44,230
I'll take this to our classroom.

586
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:46,060
But...

587
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:54,980
Does it make sense to give up love
because of Hwang Ro Mi?

588
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:58,650
- Love is a little extreme.
- Let's call Ro Mi. We have to negotiate and settle this.

589
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:01,070
No, don't do that. Ro Mi's not really good nowadays.

590
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:03,150
Her home situation isn't that good,
to make matters worse.

591
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:07,120
- Isn't that false? She's always bluffing.
- That's true.

592
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:11,540
Honestly, you're always so nosy,
so we brought her along.

593
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:14,780
She used to not have any friends,
acting like she was all that.

594
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:17,420
Come on, don't be like that.
After all this time, why talk behind her back?

595
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:24,030
Anyway, I want to keep this secret from Ro Mi for now.
Help me do that.

596
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:28,480
I think it's good to do what Soo Bin says.

597
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:34,720
Fine. We'll help you. In return, go see the movie.

598
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,710
That's right. Are you guys having some sort of affair?
Did Choi Joon Woo and Ro Mi go out?

599
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:45,320
We'll give you cover. If you go once,
you can't go back to being eighteen. What is this?

600
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,820
Soo Bin, go.

601
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:51,410
- Go.
- At least watch a movie.
- At least watch a movie.

602
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:54,080
- At least watch a movie.
- There's nothing wrong with a movie.

603
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:57,860
You're only watching a movie.

604
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:02,010
Buying just one cola...
And some popcorn.

605
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:04,170
I'm so jealous.

606
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:07,090
- You're jealous?
- What is this?

607
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:08,660
I said it's fine.

608
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:13,410
Take it and eat.
You must be starving after your shift.

609
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:16,850
Oh, I should have packed some chicken.

610
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:19,150
Hey.

611
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,230
- Bye.
- Bye.

612
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:28,520
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

613
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:35,860
Hey, Choi Joon Woo.
What is this?

614
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:39,830
- You're dating Soo Bin?
- Huh?

615
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:43,480
"Soo Bin said to keep this secret,
but I'm telling only you.

616
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:48,130
"Choi Joon Woo and Yoo Soo Bin:
our class's second couple. Exclamation point."

617
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,630
You...

618
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:58,370
That's... it's not at that stage yet.

619
00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:01,510
Kwon Da Huin has a loose mouth.

620
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:04,950
Hey, am I really your best friend?
How do I not know about such important news?

621
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:07,370
- I was going to tell you, but—
- Going to?

622
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:09,870
This was a little hard to tell you.

623
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:12,810
This... hard?

624
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:16,750
Oh! So that time, Moon Chan Yeol...

625
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:22,570
I didn't know what was going on, so I was getting really dizzy. But now I put all the pieces together.

626
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:27,300
- Choi Joon Woo, you're amazing. Leaving your best friend in the dark, secret dating.
- It's not so.

627
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:31,050
- You're really the best. So that's why your last name is Choi?
- No, no, it's not like that.

628
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:36,080
- What do you mean, no? You know I'm right.
- You're having a big misunderstanding right now.

629
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:40,200
I'm not misunderstanding anything right now, though.
I even have the whole story. Should I show you? I can scroll.

630
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,770
No, no. For now, I'll tell you tomorrow.
Go home.

631
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:47,700
- Tomorrow?
- Bye.

632
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:08,340
They say Soo Bin and Choi Joon Woo
are watching a movie tomorrow.

633
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:11,220
They confessed to each other.

634
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:17,780
Hmm, should I have bought some clothes?

635
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:21,860
What to wear?

636
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:25,340
- Soo Bin!
- Yeah! Yeah, yeah!

637
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:28,210
- Hurry up and eat!
- Yeah, yeah, just a minute!

638
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:30,910
Come out!

639
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:37,930
- Hurry and come out!
- I'm coming, I'm coming.

640
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:45,340
Ugh, what a waste.

641
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:56,410
What to wear?

642
00:52:57,530 --> 00:53:01,010
Let's see...
Why do I feel like all my clothes are the same?

643
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:05,390
What do you think is good?

644
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:10,140
I don't know. I also don't know.

645
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,910
This isn't it, either.

646
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:16,640
♬ The things you like ♬

647
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,820
I have to sleep, I have to sleep.

648
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:25,630
Yoo Soo Bin. Hurry and sleep.
You'll have honey skin if you sleep.

649
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:29,970
Honey skin, honey skin.

650
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:35,100
♬ Just in case ♬

651
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:39,500
♬ I kept looking at my phone ♬

♬ Let's just think of the times we loved ♬

654

♬ This night is passing by quickly ♬

655
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:58,380
♬ And I'm okay with that ♬

656
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:03,440
♬ Drawing your face in my head ♬

657
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,580
♬ I want to hear your voice ♬

658
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:12,360
♬ I'm crying all of a sudden ♬

659
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:16,850
♬ And my tears are dripping ♬

660
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:21,610
♬ If I knew this is what it feels ♬

661
00:54:21,610 --> 00:54:27,860
♬ To miss someone ♬

662
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:39,440
♬ I wouldn't have let you go ♬

663
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:44,000
Oh, this is bad, this is bad.
I have to sleep, sleep.

664
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:48,770
♬ I wouldn't have let you go ♬

665
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:13,860
Oh no! Swollen like the moon.

666
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:28,430
Oh, I came out an hour too early.
I'm so silly.

667
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:31,630
Why did I come out so early?

668
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:07,970
Still, ten minutes left.
Choi Joon Woo's still not here, right?

669
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,100
You're here?

670
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:38,040
Yeah. Sorry.
I'm a little late, right?

671
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:42,000
You're not late though.
There's still ten minutes left.

672
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,420
- Want to go in?
- Oh, I'll hold this.

673
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:48,070
Thanks.

674
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:52,350
It's not fresh at all. And there's no ice.

675
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:57,970
Maybe that's because I bought it too long ago?

676
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,180
You came early, didn't you?

677
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:07,300
- I'll buy another one.
- No, I don't like it too cold. I like this.

678
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:10,440
- Let's go.
- Okay.

679
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:01,620
This situation always comes out in dramas.

680
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:23,590
But this is kind of a lot.

681
00:59:48,070 --> 00:59:57,050
♬ The day on which a small door opened
and the world changed ♬

682
00:59:57,050 --> 01:00:02,860
♬ was all about my feeling of happiness ♬

683

Moment at Eighteen
~ Preview ~

684
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:07,840
He must really hate me right now.

685
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:11,030
Because I don't want to steal it.
Because I can't steal it.

686
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:12,910
I understand it.
What must he have been going through?

687
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:14,870
- Lee Yeon Woo...
- Yoon Song Hee?

688
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:16,250
But this won't be possible, right?

689
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:18,920
Mother, this is a very serious issue.

690
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,110
You want another one?

691
01:00:20,110 --> 01:00:22,620
Don't tell Joon Woo that I know.

692
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:24,150
It hurts my pride.

693
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:27,500
You can tell me anytime what I did wrong.

694
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:29,710
I'll fix it.

695
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:33,700
The school trip is back!

696
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:35,880
How about those who want to have a fun school trip

697
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:38,350
prepare for it? Instead of those who think it's a waste of time?

698
01:00:38,350 --> 01:00:40,950
Can't you do the school trip event with us?

699
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:42,120
If you listen to my wish.

700
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:46,340
You really liked me a lot...

701
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:48,930
Soo Bin.
