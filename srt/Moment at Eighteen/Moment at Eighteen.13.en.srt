1
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,310
What are you doing?

2
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,510
The girl you were dating is Soo Bin?

3
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,570
I...

4
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:50,190
Mom...
I was going to tell you after exams.

5
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,030
Soo Bin.

6
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,800
What's this?

7
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,890
What's this?

8
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,930
What are you two doing?
Let go of her!

9
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,700
What is this!

10
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,120
What are you doing right now!

11
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,830
What? What is this?!

12
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,340
Mom...

13
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,150
Go home.

14
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,360
I'll be downstairs.

15
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,600
Go home. Go.

16
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,220
Go home, I said!

17
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,250
Sit down.

18
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:40,310
Can I ask you something?

19
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,960
Yes.

20
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,920
By chance,

21
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,730
do you sleep here with Soo Bin?

22
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,200
You have to tell me honestly

23
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,800
in order for us to handle it quickly.

24
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:23,420
Nothing like that ever happened.

25
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,640
Okay. Thank you.

26
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,800
At least, thanks for not hesitating.

27
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,590
You know what I'm going to say, right?

28
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,460
Don't date Soo Bin.

29
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:42,660
Don't speak to her from now on.
Pretend not to know her.

30
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,100
Because nothing happened between you two.
Right?

31
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,710
Nothing happened between the two of you. Huh?

32
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:56,250
My Soo Bin is not someone that someone like you can date.

33
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,740
Joon Woo, your mom is a very good person.

34
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,520
I think you will be, too.

35
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,300
That should be true, right, Joon Woo?

36
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,940
Yes.

37
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,200
Joon Woo, I beg of you.

38
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,560
Mom.

39
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,030
Mom.

40
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,290
He said he wouldn't date you.

41
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,400
He promised.

42
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,540
This is as far as it goes.

43
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,710
Come down.

44
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:43,480
Soo Bin, are you okay?

45
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:50,340
Tell your mom sorry. I'm fine.

46
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,710
You don't have to give it up if you don't want to.

47
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:04,150
You may keep it. But in return, I'll leave the house.

48
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:08,190
I'll quit my job. Just quit everything.

49
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,470
You know how I follow through once
I set my mind to it, right?

50
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:13,000
I don't need these things.

51
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,030
Go study.

52
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,890
Mom.

53
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,370
Yeah?

54
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:32,820
Is my dating Choi Joon Woo this wrong?

55
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,610
Yeah.

56
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,410
Why?

57
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,600
You're my everything. You...

58
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,410
You are, more than me...

59
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:59,220
You're my everything that's more
precious to me than myself.

60
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,660
You're my last pride.

61
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,630
Someone like that dating someone like him...

62
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,880
Hanging out with someone like him makes no sense,
my daughter.

63
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,620
Understand?

64
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:20,880
If I had dated someone else,
would you have been okay?

65
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,530
Take it if you don't want to give it up.

66
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,890
Do what you want.

67
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,570
Do what you want.
If you don't need me around, do what you want.

68
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,540
I'll go study.

69
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,720
Mom...

70
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,760
Yeah.

71
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,860
That kind of threa—

72
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,520
Never mind.

73
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:05,120
That I am afraid something might
happen to you or might disappear

74
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,180
is not the reason I'm doing as you say.

75
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:12,790
I'm so sick and tired of your threats like this
is what I wanted to say,

76
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:17,790
but if I do,
I'm afraid you might dislike Joon Woo even more.

77
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,970
Yeah, Mom.

78
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,280
Joon Woo! Did something happen?

79
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,710
Why does your face look bad?

80
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,790
There's nothing.

81
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,160
Maybe the light is dim?

82
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,690
It's because you've been studying hard
for the exams, isn't it?

83
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,580
Oh no, my son. I couldn't take care of you.

84
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,210
Were you doing the dishes?

85
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:16,710
Yeah. I'm fine.

86
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,860
Are you getting a lot of customers?

87
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,640
Yeah, of course. Maybe because of the remodeling,
we have a lot of people coming in.

88
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,440
We even had a group come in earlier.

89
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,300
Twenty people! It's totally cool, isn't it?

90
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,990
Okay, Joon Woo, don't work too hard and sleep now.

91
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,410
- Okay.
- Okay.

92
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:36,420
Sleep well.
Fighting!

93
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:58,550
Nothing like that ever happened.

94
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,450
Thank you.

95
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:03,580
Thanks for not hesitating.

96
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,630
Soo Bin, sleep well.

97
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,080
Don't think about anything and sleep well.

98
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,420
See you at school tomorrow.

99
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:37,100
Soo Bin, say hello.

100
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,660
She'll accompany you starting today.

101
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,710
Mom...

102
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:44,440
Wait for her by the school entrance
when her classes end and then come home together.

103
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,420
Yes.

104
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,890
If she doesn't come within the time I told you,
let me know right away.

105
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,890
I'll tell the teachers, too.

106
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:53,750
Yes.

107
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:57,730
You don't have to go to the academy starting today.
I'm going to look for a live-in tutor.

108
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:01,250
Study well for the exams for now and go.

109
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,890
Please take good care of her.

110
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,910
Yes.

111
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,900
Mom.

112
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,090
Mom, who is that?

113
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,760
Because you're afraid I might see Choi Joon Woo?

114
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,170
You're too much, aren't you?

115
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:16,810
I'll just handle—

116
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:20,490
Just handle, just handle, just handle.

117
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,550
Just handle?

118
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,950
This is what happened after trusting your
"I'll just handle."

119
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,880
I don't trust you anymore. Go.

120
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:35,730
Day five of Da Huin's Ordeal.
I'm on my way to school right now.

121
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:38,530
I'm so hungry that I feel like I've hit my mental limit,

122
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:42,350
but still, I think I look pretty because I've thinned out.

123
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,760
Stop it already.

124
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,100
- Hi.
- What's this?

125
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:50,470
She's making videos and uploading them.
Calls it Kwon Da Huin overcoming her ordeal or whatnot.

126
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,260
Really?
Oh, what's that?

127
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,150
Yoo Soo Bin!

128
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,920
Yoo Soo Bin, what's this?
Are you debuting as an idol?

129
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,860
I knew it would happen.

130
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,720
- Know what?
- Can't you tell?

131
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,410
She got caught by her mom.

132
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:37,670
I'll bet my looks on Choi Joon Woo transferring within a week.

133
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,750
The psychic ghost is back.

134
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,550
Let's go.

135
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,500
I guess she found out after all.
Soo Bin's mother.

136
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,100
You should have listened to my advice.

137
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,360
I'm sure it was because she was worried
about Soo Bin getting hurt.

138
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,440
So what are you going to do now?

139
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,460
What should I do?

140
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,090
I'll have to continue to like her, Soo Bin.

141
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,750
I couldn't call you because I didn't have a phone.

142
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,230
Mom confiscated it.

143
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:17,540
You must have been upset by my mother.

144
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:26,740
It hurt a lot, right?

145
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,520
I was too thoughtless.
I shouldn't have had you over at my place.

146
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,910
No. I told you I wanted to go there first,

147
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,460
that I was curious about how you lived.

148
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,610
Still.

149
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:51,880
You did that to console me because
I was messed up over my dad.

150
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,040
I wanted to console you but it became a wound.

151
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,630
I'm sorry.

152
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,150
Don't apologize.

153
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,430
Then it'll really become a wound.

154
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,450
Soo Bin.

155
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,920
Let's endure it.
Even if it's hard.

156
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,030
You should work harder in school

157
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:27,900
and study more enthusiastically because of it.

158
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,140
I'm going to.
I'd like you to, too.

159
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:38,890
My Joon Dal has grown up.

160
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,600
I'm here for you.

161
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:56,620
I can't be a great help to you yet,

162
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:03,600
but still, I'm here for you.
Always by your side.

163
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:12,700
Since I'm only going to like you, even if it's hard.

164
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,050
Ma'am, that's a bit—

165
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:29,420
No, Teacher.
I'm pleading with you.

166
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:34,370
Please stop Soo Bin from hanging out with Choi Joon Woo.

167
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,950
Teacher, I had a very important meeting this morning,

168
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:40,880
so I was going to tell you over the phone
but then couldn't help but come here in person.

169
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,090
Ma'am, Joon Woo and Soo Bin are in the same class.

170
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,920
Ma'am, Joon Woo and Soo Bin are in the same class.

171
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,750
They've been good friends up til now,
so how do I stop them from hanging out together?

172
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:53,320
Did you know they were dating, by chance?

173
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Seriously, how as a teacher, as a homeroom teacher,
could you just let them be?

174
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:03,340
Then what else would I—

175
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,550
What if her grades go down?

176
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,840
What if she can't get into a good college?

177
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,170
What if something goes wrong by dating someone like him?
Do you not care about that?

178
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:17,530
Ma'am, Joon Woo is not like that.
He's a nice and sincere person.

179
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:21,060
I see! This is how you encouraged them to date!

180
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:25,130
I mean, how could someone so
irresponsible be a homeroom teacher?!

181
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,920
How can we send out kids
to school knowing something like this?!

182
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,420
Exactly, why, why?

183
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:37,680
Why exactly are all the mothers going overboard like this?

184
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:43,000
Teacher, I got too worked up.
I'm sorry if I was rude.

185
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:46,230
No! Not to me.

186
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,960
To Joon Woo and Soo Bin.
To the kids.

187
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,290
The kids are the mothers' children, not possessions.

188
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:56,800
Study, go to a good college, win no matter what.

189
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,190
You can be friends with that one but not that one.

190
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:03,850
Dating?
That's never allowed.

191
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:06,790
Strangling the kids so
they can't even breathe and interfering,

192
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:10,820
censoring and cutting out even their feelings!

193
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:18,440
This place is not a prison.

194
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,400
I'm not a prison guard...
so how long

195
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,800
do I need to crush and keep good and beautiful kids
unconditionally under surveillance for you, huh?!

196
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:33,830
You're very upset.
I'm sorry.

197
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,090
I'm sorry, too.

198
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,110
Hello, Ahjumma.

199
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:53,530
Soo Bin's in the lab.
You want me to go get her?

200
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:56,090
No, it's okay.

201
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,420
Good bye!

202
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,790
Hello.

203
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,260
Let go.

204
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,650
Don't make it worse.

205
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,480
You have something to say?

206
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,720
I won't meet up with Soo Bin outside of school.

207
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:42,790
I won't speak to her in school either.

208
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:50,940
In return, please let her go around freely.

209
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,960
I ask you for this favor.

210
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:01,150
Would there be a reason
why I should listen to your favor?

211
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,330
After I see how she behaves.

212
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:31,340
I'm going to focus on my studies.

213
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:37,120
I think that's the only thing I can do for her right now.

214
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:43,080
I don't know why I'm so lacking.

215
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,970
- Is she lacking?
- Why would she be? Not her.

216
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:54,290
Then you're not lacking either.
The one who's not lacking at all says she likes you.

217
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,150
Right?

218
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,160
Yoo Soo Bin.

219
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:09,450
- Your mom is Sherlock Holmes.
- It hurts.

220
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:12,380
I can't even put it into words. Just...

221
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,120
it hurts so much.

222
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:21,180
First, do well on the exams.
Then she'll probably change a little bit, too.

223
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:25,990
Uh-uh. Even if Choi Joon Woo became top of his class,
I don't think there will be hope.

224
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:29,270
Her mom really cares about bloodline and things.

225
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:34,130
Bloodline, my butt. Is she a dog?
Seriously, you'd be perfect if you didn't open your mouth.

226
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:38,310
- Yeah? Even when you don't open your mouth,
you're not that great.
- Whatever.

227
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:44,140
Chan Yeol, are you sick?
You've had no energy all morning.

228
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,370
- Guys.
- Huh?

229
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,210
I like Teach Han Gyeol.

230
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,740
- Who?
- Oh Han Gyeol.

231
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:58,530
You couldn't pick someone better?
There are so many guys to like out there! Why him?

232
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:02,930
What? He's cool!

233
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,980
What's wrong with him?
He's the coolest man!

234
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:12,240
I can't be in love?!
You, you, and you!

235
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,350
You're all in love!

236
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:17,490
Hey, I didn't say anything.

237
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,360
It's okay.

238
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,660
Don't cry.
You're crying?

239
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,840
Don't cry.

240
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,560
Hey!

241
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:42,450
So let's start the class.

242
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:44,840
Wait, today's...

243
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,560
Page 106.

244
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:07,510
Everyone, let's go outside.

245
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:10,520
Hey!

246
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,740
Wow, it's nice.

247
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:23,200
The sky is killer.
You guys haven't looked up at the sky these days, right?

248
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,110
- I don't think so.
- Right?

249
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:30,860
If you looked down from up there,
how we live probably looks really ridiculous.

250
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:35,900
Bothering each other to get what one wants,

251
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:40,280
hurting those who are the most precious to them.

252
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,250
Let's not do that, huh?

253
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:15,550
Joon Woo, can we talk for a bit?

254
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,440
Relax and say it.

255
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,640
It's late I know, but I wanted to apologize.

256
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:35,120
I'm angry about it, but I don't think
you meant to do it on purpose.

257
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:41,260
I shouldn't have done that, but at the time, I guess it was
really important that I made a good impression on Hui Yeong.

258
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,630
Like a fool...

259
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:49,250
But since that day, not even a day
went by where I didn't feel guilty, Joon Woo.

260
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:52,380
I'm really sorry and... really...

261
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,220
I don't know why I did that.

262
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:03,520
I regret it a lot.
I'm sorry, Joon Woo.

263
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:12,590
To be honest, I resented you guys a lot

264
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:16,550
because I had a really hard time.

265
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:26,890
I'll accept your apology for what you did wrong.

266
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:38,990
You know we're starting the mentor-mentee program, right?

267
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:43,830
Whoever is interested, submit your request by the end of today.

268
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:06,110
Do this, being a mentee.
I'm not being a mentor because of you.

269
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:08,830
They're giving out points for volunteering and I need some.

270
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:11,600
Uh, yeah. Then, I know...

271
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,240
If you don't do any of the homework I give you,
I'm quitting on the spot.

272
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,400
Okay. No, no.
Yes, Ma'am.

273
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,810
Work hard.

274
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:27,600
Right. If you manage to be in the top 200 in the class,
I'll watch a movie with you.

275
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:34,430
Uh, uh, Ro Mi.
What if I'm in the top 100?

276
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:38,500
One hundred?
Don't worry. That will never happen.

277
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:44,370
I mean, but still,
if even in your imagination I'm in the top 100?

278
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:50,460
I could date you.

279
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:55,330
- Hey, what happened?!
- D-D-Date?

280
00:27:55,330 --> 00:28:01,220
This... is low in calories.
It's vegetables in whole grain bread.

281
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:05,470
He's the one who broke up with me.

282
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:09,410
He made me some sandwiches.
Is he carrying fire in one hand and water in the other?

283
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:14,470
- Da Huin.
- That's it for today.

284
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,440
Yoon So Ye.

285
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,960
- By the way...
- Hi.

286
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,150
Can I ask you something?
You know the performance your class is going to.

287
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:35,120
Can you get me some tickets?
Please! I'm begging you.

288
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,860
What is it, Jo Sang Hoon?
What's up?

289
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,540
- What?
- Why are you asking So Ye?

290
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:43,750
Since she's part of the dance class!

291
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:48,600
Anyway, are you done with Ma Hui Yeong?
Because you think something's going to happen to him?

292
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,510
- Wow, where did all that loyal friendship go?
- It's not like that.

293
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:57,970
What do you mean? Maybe he's looking for a new informant?
You want me to do it?

294
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:02,730
Do some self-reflecting, Lee Gi Tae.
Watch whom you hang out with.

295
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:05,950
Hey! Who are you to say that to him?

296
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:11,040
He'll repent for whatever he did wrong!
Worry about yourself!

297
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,980
Cool!

298
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:27,120
Then you're not lacking either.

299
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:34,460
Someone who's not lacking at all says she likes you.

300
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:43,050
You're kind of good at drawing.
The ladybug is cute.

301
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:50,020
You did that well, too.
Not running away.

302
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:54,440
Very... good!

303
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,220
Yoo Soo Bin, fighting.

304
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:06,350
I don't think so. I'm sure she was already happy.
Because you were born.

305
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,650
♬ The day on which a small door opened ♬

306

♬ A trivial yesterday became a great today ♬

318
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:35,140
♬ Stay with me ♬

319
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:43,450
♬ My love, you. ♬

320
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,370
This...

321
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:58,160
It was you wasn't it?

322
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,390
It's really not me.
Why would I post a message on the chat line?

323
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:03,330
What reason do I have to kill mysel—

324
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:06,340
Right. I knew it was you.
I figured it out.

325
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:09,310
Teacher, tell me something honestly.

326
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:15,500
If you don't speak honestly, I'm not letting you leave.

327
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,510
There's a problem, isn't there?

328
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:22,640
The OMR card.
(Optical Mark Reader scans an answer card)

329
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,600
It was rigged. There are exactly two questions.

330
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,040
Hui Yeong's admission is a huge deal.

331
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,800
I learned about it by accident.
He made a mistake.

332
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:36,210
I also shouldn't have done that.
I really knew that,

333
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:38,990
but my family situation was very difficult then.

334
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:42,230
I made a deal with Hui Yeong's father.

335
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:47,150
No.
No matter how needy you were, how could you?

336
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:53,280
That's why I went into hiding.
I can't sleep well. I can't eat.

337
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:57,210
The vice-principal.
Does he know?

338
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:00,980
No one knows.
I am the only one. Hui Yeong doesn't know.

339
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:05,970
Hui Yeong probably thinks he got it right
thanks to marking the card wrong, too.

340
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:10,780
There's no other alternative.
Please step forward and explain it.

341
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,100
Then Hui Yeong's family and I will both die.

342
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,330
If you do this, then something bad
will happen to Hui Yeong instead!

343
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:20,210
You need to speak up about what happened!
He's a kid with a bright future!

344
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,500
Please set it right.

345
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:29,470
Something done among the adults,
the adults should reveal it and pay for their wrongdoing.

346
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:34,520
Then give me a little time.

347
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,200
My Ji Min

348
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:46,090
Yes, Ji Min. Hello?

349
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,980
Teacher, I have something to tell you.

350
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:55,610
Are you okay?
Are you sick? Is something wrong?

351
00:34:55,610 --> 00:35:00,080
I... need some time.

352
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:05,200
- What, what kind of time?
- Whether I can continue to date you...

353
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,900
If I'm worthy of it, I'm not sure...

354
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:12,650
What do you mean... worthy?

355
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:16,720
I think I'm lacking in many ways.

356
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:22,070
- I'm sorry.
- Ji Min, Ji Min. Hel—

357
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:44,040
Your drawings aren't bad.
First, what you have to prepare depends on your grades.

358
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:48,580
With your grades, I think preparing something
in the basic design category would be good.

359
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:53,890
For the schools that look at basic design categories, your skills test grade account for 60-100% even of your total grade.

360
00:35:53,890 --> 00:36:00,980
So if you take good care of your grades and prepare for
your skills test, you have a lot of schools you could go to.

361
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:10,380
By chance,
would it be okay if there's a blemish on my records?

362
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,730
Like a forced transfer...

363
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:18,780
It could affect it, but each school
has their own grading system.

364
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:22,910
If you're looking at the higher-level schools,
your grades would have to be better,

365
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:30,070
but if not, you could look into schools
that only look at your skill, so that's a possibility.

366
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:34,650
Oh, I see.
Then about what about tuition?

367
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:41,410
Well, do you want me to give you
an idea of academy costs?

368
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:44,650
Yes.

369
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,800
- Give it to me, I'll do it.
- Just study over there instead of using up your energy.

370
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,760
It's good for concentrating anyway.

371
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,690
It's because of Noona Ji Min, right?

372
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,660
Do you know too?

373
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:37,890
She talked about you.
That you're so nice but that she doesn't feel ready yet.

374
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:43,990
Wha... what? Ready for what?
Is she going fishing? Hiking?

375
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:48,000
Just try waiting, even though it must be hard.

376
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,020
Like you and Soo Bin?
Even though it must be hard?

377
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:03,690
Seriously, liking someone is difficult. Right?

378
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:09,480
Whether you're 18, 28, or 38.

379
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:14,590
Teach... you're 28?

380
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:20,880
Whether you're 48 or 58...

381
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,280
or 68 or 78...

382
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:32,570
88... or 98... 108.

383
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:37,040
Hey, Joon Woo.
Eat a lot. Here.

384
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,750
Hey, I have some expectations for your exams.

385
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:43,720
You seem to be studying hard.
Sense of coming up on your grades?

386
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:48,350
You've decided to put your all into it?

387
00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:00,470
If I get good grades this time,
I thought Soo Bin's mom might get a better impression of me.

388
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:06,310
So I'm studying hard... but I still am thinking this:

389
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:12,060
even if my grades come up,
even if I come in the top of the class,

390
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:17,690
would her mother care at all?

391
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:22,230
What good is all this?

392
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:30,890
The effort I'm putting in right now, is it my best?
Those types of thoughts.

393
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:37,020
Oh, don't lose heart.
Who cares if Soo Bin's mom doesn't think as highly of you?

394
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:42,500
It's for yourself only, how you look to yourself,
that you're doing this well.

395
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:47,470
You're doing this much,
you're making your best effort in life.

396
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:51,660
Then after that?

397
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:58,250
Then, after that...
then I suppose the next story will unfold itself?

398
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:02,930
Hey, Joon Woo, think about when you first transferred.

399
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:06,510
You didn't run away then, so you met Soo Bin,

400
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:10,590
and you also met the world's best teacher like me.

401
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:13,680
You have to answer.

402
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,710
Yes.

403
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:21,400
Joon Woo, don't worry about the future and just do it.

404
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,960
Now.
Without regret. Huh?

405
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:31,880
Yes.

406
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:36,500
Seriously, if you were an adult,
we'd be having some soju. But for now,

407
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:40,090
let's have some water at least.

408
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:43,920
- One shot!
- With the water?

409
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,770
School Bulletin Board

410
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,290
You have new mail.

411
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,920
Do you think you got this far on your own merit?

412
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,690
Your last exam, 100 in math.
You must know you got two wrong, too?

413
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:12,620
Wasn't it strange that you got a perfect score?

414
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,660
That's because your homeroom teacher
manipulated your OMR card.

415
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,490
Why did you pretend not to know?
Maybe you just liked getting a perfect score?

416
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:18,620
I'll give you one last chance to reveal the truth.

417
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,640
Tell everyone the truth about manipulating
the grade and be punished for it.

418
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,790
If not, your and your parents' lives will be ruined.

419
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:43,330
Grades

420
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,430
Hi.

421
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,480
Good morning.

422
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,190
Good morning.

423
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:06,340
Why is Teacher Kim not picking up again?
Making me nervous.

424
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:14,050
Teacher, you definitely promised me.

425
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:16,990
That you'll reveal it yourself.

426
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:22,270
Teach—, I mean,
Sunbae, I have faith in you.

427
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:38,490
Cheer up, Pea

428
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,460
Punk, you don't want to go see a movie with me, huh?

429
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,840
Hey, how can you be so brutal?
That's the only thing I'm living for.

430
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,570
Solve it.

431
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:55,390
Cheer up, Pea.

432
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,420
Exam Plan Schedule

433
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:32,190
Mom.

434
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:35,500
You're up?
I was trying to be quiet.

435
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,870
Mom, when did you come?
I went to bed late.

436
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:40,320
Early morning.
To make you breakfast.

437
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,100
Your exams start today.

438
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:45,280
I wanted to come last night,

439
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,340
but there were a lot of people at the eatery till late.

440
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:49,390
I eat well on my own.

441
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:52,740
But you look this gaunt?

442
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,230
I'm glad.

443
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:58,300
I have to go soon,
so I thought I'd only get to see you sleeping.

444
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:01,510
- Again?
- I have to hurry to open the shop.

445
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:02,860
But Auntie is there.

446
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:07,210
Well, she doesn't feel well these days.

447
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:10,940
You don't seem okay either.
Are you sick?

448
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:16,210
No! I'm totally fine.

449
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:18,080
Let's eat.

450
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,820
- Eat a lot.
- Okay.

451
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:27,840
Then first, fish that's good for your brain.

452
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:34,600
You're doing well with Soo Bin, right?

453
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,640
I wonder if her mom's busy.
She's not calling me at all.

454
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,000
We were going to be like sisters.

455
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,670
She doesn't know yet about you two dating, right?

456
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:49,870
Once the exams are over, tell her.

457
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:53,850
She might seem a little,

458
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:58,140
a tiny bit rough, but she's a very cool person
once you get to know her.

459
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:03,890
She seems so different from me,
but we get along completely.

460
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:05,650
Oh, I might miss the bus!

461
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:11,560
Oh, Joon Woo, do well on the exams.
I'll send you good wishes while working.

462
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,320
Thank you.

463
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:16,350
Oh, my Son, I love you.

464
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:18,490
I'll be going.

465
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:22,610
Right, tell Soo Bin I said hi.

466
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:26,550
Do well on the exams. If you get confused,
concentrate on the numbers no matter what.

467
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:29,390
- Okay?
- Okay, Mom.

468
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,550
Mom.

469
00:47:35,610 --> 00:47:37,830
Nothing's wrong, right?

470
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:39,340
Uh-uh.

471
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:43,350
Okay.
Travel back safely.

472
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:46,410
Fighting!

473
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:48,200
Fighting.

474
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:06,030
I-Pass

475
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:33,140
♬ It was today that it happened. ♬

476
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:41,880
♬ I kept babbling nonsense. ♬

477
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:45,290
♬ While you just smile ♬

478
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:49,530
♬ stay with me and take my hand. ♬

479
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:56,660
♬ I whose thoughts are filled with you ♬

480
00:48:56,660 --> 00:49:01,800
♬ am waiting only for tomorrow again. ♬

481
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:06,250
♬ For many of my days ♬

482
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:10,440
♬ I wish you would stay ♬

483
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:16,140
♬ Even if the day is not significant ♬

484
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:29,580
She was using it.
Smells nice.

485
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:33,790
It suits her well.

486
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:17,230
Ro Mi, Ro Mi, I got more than 50.

487
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:20,820
- It's 51!
- Really?

488
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:23,420
M-Master, let me have you as my master forever.

489
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:26,760
Get lost.
I did totally bad on my exams!

490
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:30,780
It's your fault!
It's all your fault!

491
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,930
Okay.

492
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:38,300
You got all of them right?

493
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:41,280
Wow.

494
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,790
You only got four wrong?

495
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:48,230
I know. It's strange.

496
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:51,300
What's with you?
How did you do so well, Choi Joon Woo?

497
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:53,570
Foul!

498
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,430
I got so many wrong answers.

499
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,280
Da Huin, are you okay?

500
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,200
I'm okay.

501
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,380
You want me to do it?

502
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:05,780
I did it.

503
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:07,200
Did you do well?

504
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,810
A bit. You?

505
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:13,140
Me, too.

506
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:22,190
Hui Yeong, you got a hundred this time, too, right?

507
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:23,250
Okay.

508
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:24,610
Hui Yeong, you got all of it right again?

509
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:27,120
You're gonna be top of the class again!

510
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,290
So lucky.

511
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:43,090
("/" means wrong)

512
00:51:52,030 --> 00:51:54,590
Oh, Son!
You did well, right?

513
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:57,090
You're top of the class this time, too, right?

514
00:51:57,090 --> 00:51:58,390
Oh, you worked so hard, Son.

515
00:51:58,390 --> 00:52:01,690
What do I do, Mom?
I don't think I can be top of the class.

516
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:03,870
Huh? Oh, wow.

517
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:07,400
Huh? Oh, wow! My son can even joke now?
It's not at all funny.

518
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:11,290
I'm being serious.
I got five wrong in math.

519
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:13,070
What? Five?

520
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:17,560
So that's why I'm saying this, but take care of this, too.

521
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:20,320
Take care of what?

522
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:24,550
You and dad manipulated my grades last year, too,
I heard.

523
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,990
Help me this time, too.

524
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:33,750
Who said that?
Hui Yeong? Who?

525
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:38,150
Help me.
I have faith in you and Dad.

526
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:41,650
Hello?
Hello, Hui Yeong.

527
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,490
Why isn't he picking up?

528
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:51,020
Hello? Honey,

529
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:54,830
the thing is, Hui Yeong...

530
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:56,730
What do I do?

531
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:03,170
Really?
You got a 100?

532
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:05,010
Oh, what I do?

533
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:07,050
Really?
You got a 100?

534
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:08,820
Then Soo Bin, what is your midterm score?

535
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:10,660
If you add the two up, are you at the top-tier?

536
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:16,130
I have to see when the scores come out,
but I think it might be a possibility.

537
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:19,350
What do I do, Soo Bin!
You did so well.

538
00:53:19,350 --> 00:53:20,490
Thank you, my daughter.

539
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:24,870
See?
You can do it when you're determined!

540
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:27,540
Yoo Soo Bin, what do you want to eat?
I'll buy you everything.

541
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:30,350
No, no.
Let's go buy you some clothes.

542
00:53:30,350 --> 00:53:32,930
You said you wanted clothes.
Let's go to the department store. Today, I'll...

543
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:35,610
Oh, right.
I have a meeting today.

544
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:37,390
What should we do?
What do I do?

545
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:39,890
It's okay, Mom.
I'll go home and relax.

546
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:41,170
You want to relax? Okay, then.

547
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:43,920
Then I'll call you as soon as I get done and come home.

548
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,830
Let's get something good to eat. Okay? Oh,

549
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:50,700
Soo Bin... I love you so much!
We'll just keep going like this, okay?

550
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:54,630
We'll get into Seoul University, right?
Let's make sure we go! Come on!

551
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:56,640
Oh, what's going on?

552
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,610
She suddenly fainted.

553
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:05,300
Jeong Oh Je, it's urgent!
Da Huin fainted!

554
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:06,520
I think it's malnutrition!

555
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:07,840
What?

556
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,910
Come on, hurry.

557
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:11,510
Da Huin!

558
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:13,050
She fell asleep.

559
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:15,180
We'll be outside.

560
00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:20,380
Go home.
I'll take her home.

561
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:22,680
Will you?

562
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:25,510
Hey, let's wait till she wakes up.

563
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:29,680
Moon Chan Yeol, don't be slow.

564
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:33,630
Let's go then. Let's go.

565
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:45,020
Leave, Jeong Oh Je.
I don't want to see you.

566
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:47,010
You're not sleeping?

567
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:49,440
Leave, I said. Hurry.

568
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,600
I said to leave.

569
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:55,150
Then... I'll call the kids back.

570
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,930
It's not because I don't like you.

571
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:10,070
Again?
Don't say stuff like that. I'm sick of it.

572
00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:15,250
To be honest... there's someone I like.

573
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:17,530
Never mind, I said.
I don't want to hear it.

574
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:19,780
It's not a girl.

575
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:28,550
These kinds of feelings are unfamiliar for me, too,

576
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:32,830
but I can't help it.

577
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:37,620
I've been thinking about why I'm like this, too...

578
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,790
I'm sorry, Da Huin.

579
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:55,810
It's Hui Yeong, isn't it?

580
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,680
Go.

581
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:09,900
- I'll take you home.
- I said to leave.

582
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,200
Let's go, Da Huin. Huh?
Let's go home. Huh?

583
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:16,990
Are you okay?

584
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:19,900
- No, I can walk.
- No.

585
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:25,200
Hey, Jeong Oh Je, what's this?

586
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,880
What?

587
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:38,590
Da Huin! Da Huin!

588
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:42,100
- Da Huin!
- You!

589
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:58,150
- What do we do?
- It's okay, Da Huin.

590
00:56:58,150 --> 00:57:02,490
No. No.
She posted it in the chatroom.

591
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:05,480
I... I'm sorry.

592
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:07,580
It's okay, Da Huin.

593
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:20,500
Jeong Oh Je

594
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:31,570
Yeah, Oh Je, you...

595
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:33,620
Yeah.

596
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:38,720
Is... Da Huin okay?

597
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:42,360
She's okay.

598
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:45,120
That's a relief.

599
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,570
Let's talk later.

600
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:51,700
- Get her home safely.
- Yeah

601
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:52,730
- I'll hang up.
- Bye.

602
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:14,430
010-0770-2939

603
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,550
Yes, hello?

604
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:20,700
Is this Joon Woo?

605
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:34,790
Yes.
Then... I'll send you the address.

606
00:58:34,790 --> 00:58:36,830
Let's meet there.

607
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:47,700
Soo Bin, get home safely.
I'm leaving.

608
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:49,480
Where are you going?

609
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:50,930
To our cafe.

610
00:58:50,930 --> 00:58:52,780
Wh-Why are you going there?

611
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:55,000
I'll tell you later.

612
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:07,130
Soo Bin.

613
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,010
Look straight ahead.

614
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:15,510
Use this.

615
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:17,230
I'm oka--

616
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:20,700
Ma Hui Yeong

617
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:30,580
The call cannot be completed.

618
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:44,400
Ma Hui Yeong

619
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:51,950
What is it?

620
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:03,800
Hello. I'm Choi Joon Woo.

621
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:07,360
I know. You came by last time.

622
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:17,930
Sit down.
What do you want to drink?

623
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:38,530
That time, did you think I didn't recognize you?

624
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:43,840
Wasn't that what happened?

625
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:49,130
How could I not recognize you?
It's so obvious.

626
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:56,820
So you thought to write to me?
To ask me to recognize you?

627
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:04,640
It's how I was feeling, but a friend gave me the courage,

628
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:07,030
so I won't regret it.

629
01:02:08,870 --> 01:02:10,930
Your girlfriend?

630
01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:13,880
Yes.

631
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:20,580
I always used to run away from reality,
but thanks to her, I changed.

632
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:23,630
She's a friend who gives me courage.

633
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:28,190
She's a good friend.

634
01:02:28,190 --> 01:02:31,760
Right.
You shouldn't run away.

635
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:33,790
It's not good.

636
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:40,800
But Joon Woo.
I ran away, like a coward.

637
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:46,920
No. You came like this.

638
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:54,070
I came because I have a favor to ask.

639
01:02:57,450 --> 01:03:00,430
I would like it if you wouldn't show up
like that from now on.

640
01:03:10,010 --> 01:03:13,710
It was lucky that I was the one who got the letter.

641
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:20,300
You know that it's all in the past.
And you're all grown up, and I have a family.

642
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:23,860
You, in your own way, me, in my own way,

643
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:27,600
I think we each have different paths we have to take.

644
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,970
Do you understand what I'm saying?

645
01:03:32,860 --> 01:03:35,010
I'm sorry, Joon Woo.

646
01:04:08,410 --> 01:04:11,620
Driver, please drive a little faster.

Joon Woo, are you okay?

Moment at Eighteen
~ Preview ~

660
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:12,730
Mom still thinks of her first love from a
long time ago as the most beautiful moment in her life,

661
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:14,190
when she was 18.

662
01:06:14,190 --> 01:06:17,330
The only thing I can do for you right now is just this letter,

663
01:06:17,330 --> 01:06:20,180
but you have me, so let's bear with it.

664
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:21,990
I miss you, and I like you.

665
01:06:21,990 --> 01:06:23,400
You can just take care of it again.

666
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:24,840
This punk!

667
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:26,990
It was me after all.
The informant.

668
01:06:26,990 --> 01:06:29,600
Drawing? Art?
Art University.

669
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:33,480
Soo Bin.
I have a goal now.

670
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:36,170
Wow!
Office of Education came for Ma Hui Yeong.

671
01:06:36,170 --> 01:06:38,800
I acknowledge everything.
I'll cooperate with the investigation.

672
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,900
Happy Birthday.

673
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:45,490
Let's go.
I'll take you home.

674
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:51,490
♬ will be left here ♬
