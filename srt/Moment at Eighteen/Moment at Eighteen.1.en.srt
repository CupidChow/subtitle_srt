1
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,640
Sir, please head to this address.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,500
The navigation has started.

3
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,090
Today the sky is clear unlike yesterday.

4
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,410
We've had spring rains for a few days.

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,550
I'm going. Like this.

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,640
It makes us wonder if summer is on its way.

7
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,770
Just like that, I'm being taken somewhere else again.

8
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,080
Time, which I've never waited for

9
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,670
but dared to flow by me.

10
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,200
Those moments.

11
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,220
You are close to your destination.

12
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,350
Sir, it's over here!

13
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,310
Anyway, this moment.

14
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,440
Anyway, eighteen.

15
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,300
Episode 1
The Child With No Name, Choi Joon Woo

16
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,590
In 300 meters, turn left.

17
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,600
Go straight.

18
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:08,690
In 100 meters, turn right.

19
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:12,570
Where are we with the schedule?

20
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,470
I can't believe publishing still isn't done yet.

21
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,520
That crazy...

22
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,950
David, wait.

23
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,390
He's fine, right?

24
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:35,080
Don't we have to get off and ask to find out?

25
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,980
He seems fine.

26
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,500
He didn't even fall.

27
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,860
Let's go.

28
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,230
Even if he didn't fall...

29
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,080
David, sorry.

30
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,500
We need it done ASAP to meet the mobile deadline.

31
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,640
Kitty cat.

32
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,000
Where's your mom?

33
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:04,290
It's dangerous here.
Play somewhere else.

34
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,040
Bye.

35
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,950
Syeonjeong Magnet School for High Achievers

36
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,360
Yoo Soo Bin!

37
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,350
Hi!

38
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,310
Your hair grew so long!

39
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,620
Hey, you bought the bag!

40
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,980
Awesome.

41
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,570
My mom bought it on a business trip.

42
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,750
I was going to buy this too.
What if it's a knockoff?

43
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,010
There are knockoffs?
What if this really is fake?

44
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,960
I've been walking from home this whole time.
My legs hurt so much.

45
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,160
Hm, really?
I hope you succeed in losing weight.

46
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,900
I'm so tired.

47
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,060
My legs hurt.

48
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,360
Hold on a second, I'll be right back.

49
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,880
Excuse me!

50
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,930
Checkered Shirt.

51
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,110
Are you okay?

52
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,610
Sorry?

53
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:25,530
Because the car that almost hit you before was my mom's.

54
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,630
Try doing this.

55
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,850
You seem fine.

56
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,360
Still, we never know, so you
should tell the school if you feel pain.

57
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:55,210
I'm Yoo Soo Bin, Grade 11, Class 3.

58
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,920
Soo Bin, what happened?
Can you just tell him your name like that?

59
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,460
Earlier, he almost got hit by my mom's car.

60
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,590
If he got hurt, we should take responsibility.

61
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,640
Still. You don't even know who he is.

62
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,650
Hey, but doesn't he seem a little cute?

63
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:22,040
Not at all.
Kwon Da Huin, stop looking back.

64
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,360
- What?
- Stop.

65
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,720
Hey, Yoo Soo Bin!

66
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,990
Ugh, my hair got totally messed up!

67
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,190
Just look at it.

68
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:36,910
- It's okay, it's fine.
- No, it's not.

69
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:39,250
- What is it? Lunch?
- No, it's not for you.

70
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,270
Yoo Soo Bin.

71
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,830
Look what he's wearing.
Hey, you guys!

72
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,230
Yes.

73
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,540
- Hello.
- Hello.

74
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,990
Good morning.

75
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,480
Hello.

76
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,210
Hello.

77
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,640
Oh, hello.

78
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,680
- Excuse me—
- Let's see...

79
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,060
Hello.

80
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,970
See...

81
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,600
Excuse me.

82
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,830
I'm a transfer student.

83
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,490
Oh. Are you from...

84
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,230
Yes, from Byeongmun High.

85
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,060
I see.

86
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,540
Teacher Oh.

87
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,690
Mr. Oh!

88
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:52,640
Mr. Oh Han Gyeol hasn't arrived yet.

89
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,350
I'm sorry I'm late.

90
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:01,400
Go to him, okay?

91
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:05,070
Hello?

92
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,820
Yes, hello.

93
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:13,360
The homeroom teacher is currently
preparing for the orientation.

94
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,550
Yes, I understand.

95
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,350
Oh, right.
You can leave it here and go.

96
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,940
Yes, well, is there more to say?

97
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,570
Yes, of course, I see.

98
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,120
Yes. Have a good day.

99
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,130
Choi Joon Woo

100
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:53,370
Okay, so, you transferred because...

101
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,410
- I was forced to.
- Shh!

102
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,330
You don't say stuff like that out loud.

103
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:03,970
Well, things can happen in life.

104
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:07,380
Maybe we can start by changing your clothes?

105
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,660
Where can he buy the school uniform?

106
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,530
At a store that sells uniforms, probably.

107
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:12,940
Right?

108
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:17,110
Thank you. So, there's a uniform store
at an intersection in the front.

109
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,660
Get the uniforms first, and...

110
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,780
A collaboration between a luxury brand and sneakers.
On Black and Compass. 70% off. Expect an early sell-out!

111
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,440
Wait, why is this coming already?

112
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:31,600
You, uh, can first, um...

113
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,810
Okay, that kid is our class president, so follow him.
Let's follow him.

114
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:39,310
Let's follow him.

115
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,520
Come on, go with him.

116
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,580
He's a transfer student.

117
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,060
Go ahead.

118
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,870
Let's go quickly.

119
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,410
Yes, Mother.
Yes, I met your son.

120
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:55,890
He is so mature.
Yes, he will do well here.

121
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:58,000
Yes, yes.

122
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,670
Notification of Arrival. On-black + Compass
Payment Completed. Deposit confirmed.

123
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,040
I will send the product you ordered
as soon as possible.

124
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,700
Mr. Oh is cute, right?
He is our assistant teacher.

125
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,650
Our usual homeroom teacher is in the hospital.

126
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:17,810
I'm Ma Hui Yeong.
It's nice to meet you.

127
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,840
- I'm—
- Choi Joon Woo? I heard you were coming yesterday.

128
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,460
You didn't buy a uniform yet, right?

129
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,640
- Hui Yeong?
- Yeah, Gi Tae.

130
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,900
Let's go.

131
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:42,200
Lee Tae Ho

132
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,790
These pants will be better.

133
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,010
I'm okay with whatever.

134
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,550
You should not be satisfied with whatever.

135
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,800
Wear it and come out.

136
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,710
Thank you, Teacher.
It seems new.

137
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:11,210
I chose the best because you asked.

138
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,910
- You need to pay for this, you know, right?
- I know that.

139
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,250
I also have the summer one.

140
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,000
Thank you.

141
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,190
Here is today's program.

142
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:33,400
Introduce school and submit the
evaluation sheet to the transfer student.

143
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,170
Classes start at 9 am,

144
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,760
but we need to be there at 8:10 am for extra classes.

145
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,050
And for midterm exams,
I don't know if it's the same as your old school.

146
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,620
Lockers are there.

147
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,780
Lee Gi Tae is the student leader.
He will tell you which one to use.

148
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,700
8:30-8:55 Complete English review

149
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,980
Let's go.

150
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:16,140
You may not know it, but the teachers are good here.

151
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,400
They have great qualifications too.

152
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,290
They are better than instructors at academies.

153
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,510
Everyone has a speciality or does private tutoring.

154
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:28,710
But I think being in a school like this
is a better strategy for going to university.

155
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:31,290
After school night classes

156
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,260
are not necessary, but everyone does it
during the exam period.

157
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,110
For each subject,
there are different performance evaluations.

158
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:40,190
For practical evaluations...

159
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,620
It must be confusing to hear all of this at once.

160
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,610
First, get familiar with the notices in our group chat.

161
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,560
You'll get a rough idea.

162
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,890
If you don't know something, ask me.

163
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:53,600
Wait here.

164
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,570
- My gosh.
- Hey!

165
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,190
This is for you.

166
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:00,080
What?
Something happened?

167
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,930
The wheel of fate is turning.
Creak, creak.

168
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:06,500
Didn't you say the waterwheel was spinning last time?

169
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,900
Let's go.
There are lots of people at NW.

170
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,850
- What direction is NW? North, east, south or west?
- North, dummy.

171
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:15,780
- Okay, north.
- Hey, hey, hey, the bulletproof car.

172
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,770
Hey, where is the bulletproof car?

173
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,400
Idiot, you should know where it is!

174
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,820
Sit down, hurry up.

175
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,060
Get it together!

176
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:32,330
Yoo Pil Sang, sit down.

177
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,160
It's time for our morning reunion.

178
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,960
Yoo Pil Sang?

179
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,260
Yes, what?
What?

180
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,020
Jerk!

181
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,660
Mr. Ho suddenly had something come up.

182
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,300
Every day...

183
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,720
First, I will introduce the new transfer student.

184
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,470
Joon Woo.

185
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,020
We already saw him, right?

186
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,230
Hey.

187
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,120
He is...

188
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,700
Joon Woo, introduce yourself.

189
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,650
I am Choi Joon Woo.

190
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,690
That's it?
Is that on purpose?

191
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:36,020
Hey, I want to ask something.

192
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,890
Pil Sang, don't.

193
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,930
Can you introduce yourself a little bit more?

194
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,080
He comes from Byeongmun School.

195
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,650
Byeongmun?
Where is that?

196
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:53,690
Doesn't seem like a good school.

197
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:57,900
He moved suddenly because of his parents' work.

198
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,080
That's why he transferred to our school.

199
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,130
Let's hear the details in time from him and—

200
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,660
It was not because of my parents' work.

201
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,090
- Really?
- So, for what reason?

202
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:13,290
A personal matter?

203
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,670
I was transferred because—

204
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:22,410
He is new so we have to all help him.

205
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,420
His seat will be...

206
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,130
Sorry, sorry.

207
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,570
Jeong Oh Je is here.

208
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,970
Oh Je, can you move to another seat?

209
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,960
Next to Pil Sang.

210
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,830
Joon Woo is a new transfer student.

211
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,540
What is this?

212
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,190
Will I mistreat the new student or something like that?

213
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,370
But you will.

214
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,160
You jerk.

215
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:56,580
Well, alright.

216
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,440
Thank you.

217
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,060
Joon Woo.

218
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,760
My god, you stink.

219
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,450
Welcome.

220
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,930
I have other things to tell you.

221
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:18,830
There are a lot of groups which haven't done
their performance evaluation assignments yet.

222
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:21,860
And, Pil Sang, stay quiet.

223
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,490
Everyone, sorry, sorry, sorry.

224
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:27,240
- What is this?
- I can't believe it!
- You are the assistant teacher so you think you can do this?

225
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,300
What did I do?
I just came in.

226
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,990
- Done?
- Not yet.

227
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,370
I introduced the transfer student and give him a seat.

228
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,290
Oh, I see.
Great job.

229
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,150
Where is he?

230
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,890
Oh, you are here.

231
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:50,690
So, yes. Midterm exams arrive in three weeks.
What do we have to do?

232
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,920
I'm Lee Gi Tae.

233
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,380
- Let's get along.
- Mr Oh, she thinks that you caught a cold.

234
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,740
Me, how did you know?

235
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,210
Let's start.
Be quiet.

236
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:11,260
If this door does not open, just...

237
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,940
Joon Woo, did you get a good spot?

238
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,580
- You did not have to do that.
- Really?

239
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,630
You said I was transferred because of my parents' work.

240
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,380
Oh.

241
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:39,450
I said that because you seemed awkward about it.

242
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,440
But you can't lie because of awkwardness.

243
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,710
Who cares about that?

244
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:53,590
Our class president is always that considerate.

245
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:55,520
Checkered Shirt!

246
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,710
We ended up in the same class.

247
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,550
No way.

248
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:05,240
Again?
You were on bike this morning and...

249
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,640
At the school gate.

250
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,030
Oh, you remembered.
At the school gate.

251
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,110
Do you know each other?

252
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,150
Sort of happened that way.

253
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,930
Yoo Soo Bin, our class leader in learning.

254
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:23,290
And Ma Hui Yeong's girlfriend?

255
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:27,200
What girlfriend?
We are just friends.

256
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,130
Right, Ma Hui Yeong, kiddo!

257
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:32,750
Yeah. My classmate.
Elementary school, middle school.

258
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:37,080
By the way, Joon Woo, you should participate
in the performance evaluations.

259
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,080
Right.

260
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,500
Ro Mi, do you have a lot of people in your group?

261
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,830
We finished it already.
We are going to submit it today.

262
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,850
Really?

263
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:50,590
What can we do?
Our group has too many kids.

264
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:53,730
So, some other group...

265
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:58,070
He can come into ours. We have a vacancy.
Somebody went to study abroad.

266
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,740
Yoo Soo Bin...

267
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:04,260
I'll tell you what you should do later.

268
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,820
Joo Woo, you're lucky.

269
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,550
To be in the same group as Soo Bin's.

270
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:21,340
Soo Bin is the queen of performance evaluation.

271
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,900
She's thorough.

272
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,670
You've boarded the bus.
Have a great ride.

273
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,530
That girl.

274
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:33,780
You didn't have to put the transfer student in your group.

275
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,600
What could I do?
We don't have much time left.

276
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,500
The Learning Leader should take care of it.

277
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,460
Even so.
You must get good grades in literature this term.

278
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,930
Soo Bin! How can you do that?

279
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:48,200
Didn't you even get permission from So Ye and me,
the group members?

280
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,840
Why now?
For both the last class and this class, who did all the work?

281
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:58,810
Furthermore, who still hasn't turned in her share
of the assignment?

282
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,820
I did it this time too.

283
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,050
Well, I was going to send it tonight.

284
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,730
Is that so?
Good job, Miss Kwon Da Huin

285
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:08,520
Even so, let's live helping each other nicely.

286
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:14,900
Why were you disciplined at your prior school?

287
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:19,320
Excuse me, Vice-Principal.
The reason is written here on the first page.

288
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,670
I'm asking to confirm it.

289
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,440
Yes, I understand.

290
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:29,070
The reason for the mandatory transfer
was multiple incidents of theft and assault, right?

291
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,810
That is...

292
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:35,040
Tae Ho.
There will be no further incidents of this nature.

293
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,990
Our school is fundamentally different
from the one you previously attended.

294
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:41,860
This school has a long tradition and is elite.

295
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:45,100
If you begin to commit such disgraceful acts again,

296
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:50,030
in the worse case, as far as even dropping out...

297
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:55,940
- Excuse me... Can we just do that now?
- Huh?

298
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,290
Can I drop out?

299
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:04,750
Are you impulsive by nature?

300
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:09,150
Why did you provoke the Vice-principal?
You will only have a hard time at school.

301
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:12,960
If you listen to his all-hell-is-breaking out lecture man-to-man,

302
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,760
it'll make you really want to drop out.

303
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,520
Excuse me, Tae Ho.

304
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,060
It's Joon Woo.
The uniform is second-hand.

305
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,230
So, Joon Woo...

306
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,590
That you were forced to come here,

307
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:31,760
no one knows about that except
the teachers back there and me.

308
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,760
So don't say anything uselessly
unnecessary and pollute the atmosphere.

309
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,370
Just...

310
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,060
Let's make a fresh start.

311
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:45,320
Forget the past completely, okay?

312
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,700
Let's do it! Let's!
Come on!

313
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:55,020
The transferred student comes from another planet?

314
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,230
There is no information

315
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,720
about him online.

316
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:02,910
- Stop it, Da Huin.
- What?

317
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:05,560
I need to find out.

318
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,300
Because of Yoo Soo Bin, he is with us.

319
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,300
You are into him, right?

320
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,370
He is your style.

321
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,490
What are you talking about?
That's not it.

322
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:20,580
Well, I admit he is good-looking.

323
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,800
He's not my style.

324
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:26,240
- That's right. Da Huin's style is Jeong Oh Je.
- Oh Je.

325
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,970
My gosh!

326
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,100
Hey!

327
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,170
The transfer student was no joke!

328
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,140
What did you find?

329
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,330
Forced transferred student Choi Joon Woo

330
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:36,720
Assault and theft?

331
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,130
- Does that mean he stole?
- Oh, you see!

332
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:44,720
What are we going to do about it, Soo Bin?
So Ye, what should we do now?

333
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,280
What should I do?
Choi Joon Woo is not a gangster or a thug.

334
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,570
Who knows?
There are many good-looking crazy persons now.

335
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:53,820
Kwon Da Huin.
Don't go overboard.

336
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:57,550
Isn't this the transfer student?

337
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,710
He is?

338
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,120
You're right. It is the bike incident guy.

339
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,030
Lighthouse Music Institute
Twenty four 7

340
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,500
Welcome!

341
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,080
Hello, I heard you were hiring.

342
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,700
Ah, are you a student?

343
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,710
As you can see,
I'm in my second year of high school.

344
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:41,130
Not a middle school student?

345
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,360
No, I'm not.

346
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,340
It's a joke.

347
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:50,020
What are you good at?

348
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,320
Do you have to be good at something?

349
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,100
Of course! You won't get hired
if you aren't good at something.

350
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,420
I knew he was gonna do this! HEY!

351
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,810
HEY! That shoplifter!

352
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,030
Take it. Damn.

353
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,890
What's the matter?

354
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:34,700
Take it.

355
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:52,100
You are good at something!
Running! Good job!

356
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,670
Huh?

357
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,320
Put them back in the right place.
Hurry, hurry.

358
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,320
Hurry, hurry!

359
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,860
Sure.

360
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:27,670
Excuse me, does this mean I got hired?

361
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:32,100
I'll see after you put all those away, hurry! Hurry.

362
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:35,460
Yes, boss.

363
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,900
Why is that ajumma always
making those kinds of orders?

364
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:41,320
Okay, I understand.
Yes.

365
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:51,050
Park Yeong Bae.
There's an outside errand.

366
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,860
Park Yeong Bae

367
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:01,000
Starting now for the next 20 minutes,
I will explain exponential functions.

368
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:03,520
Why should we do something so basic?
It's an essential concept.

369
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,800
According to the principle,
we replace the parameters one at a tine.

370
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,830
As all of you know, even though
some of you don't have to do this.

371
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:13,440
Now, first, let's look at when
both A and B are greater than 1.

372
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,760
This is X.

373
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,340
I said not to do that.

374
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:24,550
First, let's see how far you've solved it.
I'll take the time to check your work individually.

375
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:28,080
Check why you got it wrong.

376
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,510
You keep making mistakes, Hui Yeong.

377
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,220
Right?

378
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,130
Weird.
I feel like you'd do well.

379
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:46,800
Hui Yeong, you must never go wrong when you make a radius.

380
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:53,000
I'm starving. Ma Hui Yeong,
isn't your mother ordering a night snack tonight?

381
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,330
It will come.

382
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,400
- I said, check your answers!
- Okay.

383
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:01,810
Take your time. In this example,
what are you looking for?

384
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,510
Hui Yeong, you got this wrong?

385
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:07,920
You shouldn't have gotten this one wrong.
Wait a min, teacher.

386
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,190
If you keep doing this, I might be first place.

387
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,710
You too! If you keep doing this,

388
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:12,910
I'll rip your ears off.

389
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:16,350
You're distracting, go away.

390
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,070
Here, let's see.

391
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:23,480
How far did we get?

392
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,380
Leave it alone.

393
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,840
Yes, sir.

394
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:35,150
Okay, from here, you're supposed to...

395
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:39,260
Why did you get this answer?

396
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,210
Jo Sang Hoon, are you solving this right now?

397
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:47,630
Yeah, yeah.

398
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,970
Yup. Yup, that's right.

399
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:52,850
That's right.

400
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,750
That's how you solved it?

401
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:08,620
My gosh, it's faster like that.

402
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:13,080
This is right too, but I think that's a better way to solve it.

403
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,040
What's so hard about this that you're struggling with it?

404
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,560
Isn't that right, Hui Yeong?

405
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:23,520
Jo Sang Hoon, not everyone is a genius like you.

406
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,400
Yes, sir.

407
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,660
If he quit smoking, he would be perfect.

408
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,220
Anyway, never drop this.
Stop making mistakes.

409
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,860
Yes, sir.

410
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,970
It's a mistake.

411
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:48,420
Let's all take a break, get some fresh air.

412
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,360
Jo Sang Hoon.

413
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,790
Yeongmul English
Haerun Math

414
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,830
I'm delivering to the first class.

415
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:32,780
Ah! Hui Yeong's mom.
There, the room at the very end.

416
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,380
Yes, sir.

417
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:41,280
Kid. Can you throw away the recyclable trash in the classroom? Could you do that too?

418
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,930
- Oh, yes.
- Thank you.

419
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,580
Joon Woo.

420
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,970
What's up?

421
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:44,790
Huh?
I'm here to deliver.

422
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:49,760
The teacher asked me to trash these.

423
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,770
Why did he ask you to do this?
Here, give it.

424
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,870
It's okay.

425
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:55,090
Give it.

426
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:57,030
Ma Hui Yeong!

427
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,830
What are you doing?

428
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,790
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

429
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,580
Thank you.

430
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:09,290
The timing was perfect.
I'm hungry, let's go.

431
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,430
Joon Woo, wait.

432
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:55,310
I think I accidentally trashed something.

433
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:01,400
Are you looking for something?

434
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,540
No, it's nothing.

435
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,920
Thanks.
Good work.

436
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:27,980
Are you looking for something?

437
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:30,040
No, it's nothing.

438
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,360
Thanks.

439
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,980
Wel...

440
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:41,840
Huh?
Are you the new worker, Park Yeong Bae?

441
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,640
Hello.
I work the late shift.

442
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,190
I'm early for studying.

443
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:47,630
Hello.

444
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:55,510
Aigoo, please.
Stop this flattery.

445
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:59,980
It's doesn't matter.
My Hui Yeong did all the setting up.

446
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:03,010
Yes!

447
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:06,800
Yeah, just buy me food next time.

448
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:12,080
You're here?
Your mom's on the phone.

449
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,900
Yeah, yes.

450
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:22,260
Stop spoiling me with compliments, Soo Bin's mom.

451
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:27,190
Oh, did you?

452
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:48,200
- You got this wrong?
- Jo Sang Hoon, not everyone is a genius like you.

453
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,280
It's a mistake.

454
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:53,620
Yes, Madame.

455
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:57,270
If you take an interest, I'll be so grateful!

456
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:03,130
Yes, rest well.

457
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:07,220
She leaves a sour taste in my mouth.

458
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,450
Hui Yeong's mom?
What now?

459
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:12,150
What do you mean, what now?
It's because of you.

460
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:15,230
I'm trying to put you in Hui Yeong's class.
What of it?

461
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:17,680
Mom.
You're sounding like a mother.

462
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:21,330
Hey! You know that no one in that class
can take the level test.

463
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:23,570
She's going to try so get ready starting today.

464
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:27,240
Mom, I don't want to.

465
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:31,370
What do I lack that you have
to ask Hui Yeong's mom to let me go there?

466
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:35,700
You.
You don't know what you lack?

467
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:40,620
Hui Yeong is the school's first place, you're 28th.
Do you think you are on the same level?

468
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,560
I'm studying too!
I'm going to raise my grades.

469
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:45,520
Haven't you been saying that for a while?

470
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,840
I don't know.
I'm not going to attend that place.

471
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,670
- Not attending, my ass.
- I'm not attending.

472
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:50,850
I'm not attending. I'm not attending.
I'm not attending.

473
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:53,620
Hey!
Then, at least get a tutor!

474
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,150
Every day you say you'll do it.
Are you a genius?

475
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:01,120
Every day she does as she pleases.

476
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:14,040
I'm sending my share of the performance evaluation.
Now I'm not the harm girl.

477
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,340
I acknowledge that.

478
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:23,050
What are you going to tell the transfer student to do?
You can't let him harm our project.

479
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,630
Ah.

480
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:28,280
What should I make, Choi Joon Woo do?

481
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,150
It's Yoo Soo Bin.
For our group performance evaluation

482
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:41,200
Heol! Violent assault?

483
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:47,410
Let's forget it.
This time, cubed radish...

484
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:57,530
He didn't seem like the type to do that.

485
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:07,190
Are you okay?

486
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:09,540
I'm sorry.

487
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:17,080
Are you okay?

488
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,150
Try doing this.

489
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,910
Mom.

490
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:22,070
Mom.

491
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,460
Son, did you go to school well?

492
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:58,510
How's the school?
You're the best looking, right?

493
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,110
Eat well, and study hard!

494
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:04,690
I have to go down to work at the restaurant
before seeing your face.

495
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:06,660
Sorry.

496
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,040
Enjoy your food!

497
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,000
Thank you.

498
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,060
Mom, you went back and forth in that short time?

499
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:25,420
Stop rushing, you're going to fall down again.

500
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,210
I thought you would run out of side dishes.

501
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:30,390
I couldn't go when you moved either.
I'm sorry, son.

502
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:32,380
Excuse me.
Give me one more bottle of soju.

503
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,910
Ah, okay!

504
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:37,090
I'm working right now.
My baby, Joon Woo.

505
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:39,500
Mom loves you!

506
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:43,780
Me too.

507
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:13,110
Hey transfer student,
should I give you some information about our class?

508
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,710
You see her?
The prettiest one.

509
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:19,610
She's mine.

510
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:27,530
Don't even look at her.
I'll scold you.

511
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:37,920
And her.
Ma Hui Yeong likes her.

512
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:41,260
You can try with the rest of the girls if you want.

513
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:44,990
It might be hard though.

514
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,650
Bravo!

515
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:57,580
Good job, Hui Yeong.

516
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:00,460
- Next play, Let it go! Let it go!
- Quiet!

517
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,940
What are you here for?

518
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:06,880
Teacher, please give me a moment.

519
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:17,500
Teacher!
I brought Choi Joon Woo.

520
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,550
You know me right?

521
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:30,510
What is the most popular sonata from Beethoven?

522
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,920
It's "Moonlight Sonata"
(Piano Sonata No. 14. Op. 27, No. 2).

523
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:37,300
This sonata is composed of three movements.

524
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:43,140
The first of these three movements,
played by Hui Yeong, is the most popular.

525
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,960
Come on, let's take a look.

526
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,290
Teacher.

527
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:47,610
Yes, Hui Yeong, what?

528
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:49,930
Can I go to the office for a short while?

529
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:15,160
Are you going to keep denying it?

530
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,900
You stole it.
My watch.

531
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,780
I didn't steal it.

532
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,190
Excuse me.

533
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:27,330
Vice Principal, Choi Joon Woo.

534
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,670
Hello.

535
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:32,900
They're saying he stole his watch.

536
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,610
What?

537
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:38,920
As soon as he transferred.

538
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:43,490
Teacher.

539
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:46,390
Hui Yeong.
This guy stole my watch

540
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:48,960
when he came to deliver yesterday.

541
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,460
Uh, by chance, is that watch expensive?

542
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:56,560
It's a $2,500 watch.

543
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,010
Twenty... Twenty five-hundred dollars?

544
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:01,270
Why did you do it, Joon Woo?

545
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,050
I didn't do it.

546
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:05,620
Right?
Teacher, he says he didn't do it.

547
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:08,190
If it wasn't you, who else would steal it?

548
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:11,470
Other than my students,
you were the only one in my office.

549
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:13,600
Hui Yeong, you know me.

550
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:18,750
Even though I wore that watch every day,
I've never lost it before.

551
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:20,830
I see.

552
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:24,800
Uh, Teacher, is there a chance you lost it somewhere else?

553
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:28,350
There's no way Joon Woo would do that.

554
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,270
Joon Woo, wait.

555
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:35,090
I think I accidentally threw something away.

556
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:43,020
How would you know that?
He transferred yesterday. It was forced at that.

557
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:47,650
Teacher, we don't have proof yet.

558
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:50,740
You should check your house, under the bed.

559
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,560
Check your bathroom cabinet again or—

560
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:57,400
I was trying to settle, but this won't do.

561
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,720
I'm going to report it to the police.

562
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,130
- No, Teacher.
- Please, stay calm.

563
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:04,090
Teacher, let's talk.

564
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:06,060
No, I have an online class to do.

565
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,790
I'll be going now.

566
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:10,910
- Please wait, Teacher.
- Just a second.

567
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:13,240
- Mr. Oh, what are you waiting for?
- Oh, yes.

568
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:24,180
Excuse me, Teacher.
Can you...

569
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,470
Do something to stop him.

570
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,100
Let me go.
What are you doing?

571
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:35,250
What are you doing?
Come here.

572
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:46,290
Excuse me, Teacher.
Please reconsider!

573
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:50,960
I have already thought a lot about this situation.

574
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:55,520
Sit here.

575
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:06,820
Ro Mi, Ro Mi, eat this yogurt.

576
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:09,330
Ro Mi, I see you don't like yogurt.

577
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:15,290
Are you sure?
Is it certain that it is Choi Joon Woo who stole it?

578
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:16,970
However...

579
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:19,970
I'm not sure.
I wish it wasn't him.

580
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:22,400
But looking at the situation, it seems to be the case.

581
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:26,140
He doesn't seem like he'd do that.

582
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:30,050
How do you know him?

583
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:37,360
Soo Bin, we're wrecked, huh.

584
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:40,820
It's not good if there are rumors like this going around.

585
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:43,820
We already have so many troublemakers.

586
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:47,080
It already spread everywhere.

587
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:51,510
That's not great.
Have you guys lost anything?

588
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:53,480
Lost anything?

589
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,890
My earrings!

590
00:44:56,890 --> 00:45:00,000
It was my birthday gift.

591
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,650
You mean this?

592
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:06,590
Kwon Da Huin.

593
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:09,810
Well, I'm just saying let's be careful.

594
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:10,930
Eat up, eat.

595
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:15,000
Hui Yeong, your class seems to have problems.

596
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,860
I heard that Song Jae made a scene.

597
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:22,410
Jo Sang Hoon, we're eating.

598
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:30,590
Do you have something to say?

599
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,620
Hui Yeong, here.

600
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:37,290
Thanks.

601
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:42,180
Sim Bok, in this day and age, you're delivering bread?
Does your mom know or not?

602
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,350
She knows.

603
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:45,830
What about your dad?

604
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:48,100
I asked him.

605
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,120
I'll get up first.

606
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:54,250
Sim Bok, you can eat here.

607
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:56,740
Thanks.

608
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:58,930
I'll get going too.

609
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:04,450
You can sit here.

610
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:07,450
Well, so I'll leave it to you.

611
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:09,520
Salute.

612
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,710
- Yes.
- Yes.

613
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:12,230
Yes.

614
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:14,880
Goodbye.

615
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,670
Teach, how'd it go?

616
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:23,720
They can't do anything to Joon Woo
since they don't have evidence.

617
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:26,120
I heard there's no CCTV in your classroom
at your after school class.

618
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,850
No, there isn't.
Such a relief though.

619
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:31,810
Relief, my ass.
The school principal's horns are showing.

620
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:38,270
He said, "Send him to another school."
He just came yesterday, how can we send him again?

621
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,650
Vice-principal asked me.
I have to go, so talk with Joon Woo.

622
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:49,320
Alright.

623
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:02,610
You didn't eat lunch, right?

624
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:06,160
Eat it.

625
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,250
Thanks.

626
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:20,400
There is no proof.
Everything will be fine because the school is doing its best.

627
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,600
And Teacher is not someone who is mean.

628
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:33,320
Do you think I stole it too?

629
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:38,370
Of course not.

630
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:16,600
Do you think I stole it too?

631
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,600
Of course not.

632
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,910
You're scratching, again!

633
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:25,070
Mom.

634
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:27,480
What are we going to do, Son?

635
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:34,070
You can't scratch, even if it's itchy.
You have to endure it or your atopy is going to get worse.

636
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:38,980
You seem in a good mood, Mom.

637
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:41,650
Your hyung is again the top student in his specialty.

638
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:47,070
How can he be so studious?
He blows away all those great western students.

639
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:48,950
Dad will be so happy about it.

640
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:50,380
Not only will he be happy about it,

641
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:54,620
for someone who never smiles,
his lips will be up by his ears.

642
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:55,750
You're happy too, right?

643
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:57,100
Of course, I am!

644
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,480
How great would it be if every day was like today?

645
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:03,360
I'm happy because you're happy.

646
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:07,830
You should do well too so that
I can continue being happy.

647
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:12,050
Sorry.
I should be bothering my son.

648
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:15,640
Study hard.

649
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:19,400
Just do as much as your brother, Hui Yeong.

650
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:24,790
I love you.

651
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:27,860
Wash up and continue.

652
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:43,100
♬ Is easy ♬

653
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,350
Joon Woo,

654
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:48,330
can you bring your mother tomorrow?

655
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:04,990
Good evening, Yeong Bae.
You can go now.

656
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:06,480
Yes, sir.

657
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:22,020
"I am Park Yeong Bae's father."

658
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:25,320
"Our Yeong Bae isn't like that."
I just need to do it like that, right?

659
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,830
Yes.

660
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,990
It's hard to work and go to school at the same time, huh.

661
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:33,170
Taking the GED would be better instead.

662
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:36,750
Me too, my parents passed away early
so I went through a lot.

663
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:38,910
Ajusshi.

664
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:42,470
I'm not Park Yeong Bae.

665
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:47,850
Oh right! That Park Yeong Bae vest!
When will I figure that out?

666
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:51,190
Lee. Tae. Ho.
I am Lee Tae Ho's father.

667
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:52,760
This isn't my name either.

668
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,030
Huh? Then?

669
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:57,850
Joon Woo! Where were you?
I was looking all over for you.

670
00:50:57,850 --> 00:50:59,390
Your mother's here.

671
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:01,780
- What?
- Your mother.

672
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,430
Mom.

673
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,190
Your father is here too.

674
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:12,720
Uh, the thing is...

675
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,790
Hello, Honey.

676
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:26,890
So, as I said,

677
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:31,130
with the Ministry of Education coming to review our school

678
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:34,070
this is a crucial moment for us.

679
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:37,930
Plus, I think

680
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:39,850
our... Tae Ho...

681
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:43,380
It's Joon Woo.
Choi Joon Woo.

682
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:47,270
Your son seems to be someone vulnerable.

683
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:52,000
I'm afraid he'll become a target for other students in our school.

684
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,940
It's possible for him to become a victim.

685
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:58,210
- I don't—
- I will transfer him.

686
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:06,000
I will work in the countryside,

687
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,150
I will bring him with me.

688
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:12,720
I see. Good thinking.

689
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:18,240
In my opinion, it's great that vulnerable
and emotional kids like him

690
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:22,520
always stay with their mothers.

691
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:27,100
- Do you also agree, Ajussi?
- Yes.

692
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:29,080
It's like that.

693
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:34,100
Excuse me, wait. Mother.

694
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:35,670
There's no need to go this far.

695
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:39,380
I don't think the vice-principal
really wanted him to be transferred elsewhere.

696
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:42,980
Do you avoid poop because you're scared of it?

697
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:44,650
What?

698
00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:47,000
You avoid it because it's dirty.

699
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,500
- My Joon Woo isn't one to steal.
- Of course not.

700
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,080
What's wrong with this school?

701
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:57,460
Isn't this school a place that accepts students in need?

702
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:03,500
The previous school was the same. These schools,
which do not trust or accept students like that, are really rubbi—

703
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:07,170
I mean, these kind of schools are really...

704
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:10,720
It's really annoying.

705
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:15,890
We'll leave.

706
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:19,860
I didn't suspect Joon Woo.

707
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:24,360
I need to look for a home near my job.

708
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:27,080
I'll take Joon Woo, the day after tomorrow.

709
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:31,480
Until then, please take care of him.

710
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:34,440
Mother...

711
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:38,710
Joon Woo, I'll be going first because I have work.

712
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:42,220
Don't you dare let this make you feel insecure in any way.

713
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:48,890
I'll call you.

714
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:51,020
Go.

715
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:56,910
Let's go, Honey.

716
00:53:56,910 --> 00:53:58,320
Yes, Honey.

717
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:01,140
Mother. Mother.

718
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:03,510
Please rethink...

719
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:05,550
Be careful!

720
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:09,260
Goodbye.

721
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:18,910
Your mother has a strong presence.

722
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:21,570
You don't resemble her.

723
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:30,220
The transfer student is going to transfer again.

724
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:33,700
What is this?
Is it his pastime?

725
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:37,290
He's lucky he's not going to go to
juvenile detention after stealing an expensive watch.

726
00:54:37,290 --> 00:54:41,440
But, did he really steal it?
Who goes there again?

727
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:44,920
Hui Yeong and Jo Sang, anyone else?

728
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:53,220
Where did we leave off last time?

729
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:59,180
Teach, about Joo Woo,

730
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:02,260
I don't think it's right to just send him away like this.

731
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:04,790
Yes, well, It's not confirmed yet.

732
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:10,680
Even if the school can't do anything,
we should be on Joon Woo's side.

733
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:12,230
He's our friend.

734
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:13,930
He's right.

735
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:17,780
I'd like us to be the source of strength
for Joon Woo and have faith in him.

736
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:23,660
Joon Woo, don't just leave like this.

737
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:26,120
I'll go talk to the principal again.

738
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:28,460
I'm not going right now.

739
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:36,230
Joon Woo is going the day after tomorrow.

740
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:39,310
There is still time, so why don't we study?

741
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:43,310
If we have a midterm exam coming,
what progress have we made?

742
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:47,730
So what!

743
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,230
Where did we leave off last time?

744
00:55:51,230 --> 00:55:53,400
At page 93.

745
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:05,680
Here is our group presentation.
Can you search some references, please?

746
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:09,410
I marked these references here.

747
00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:13,730
You are part of our group, so you should do this, at least.

748
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:15,680
- I'm going to—
- When and if you leave our school,

749
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:19,070
your name is on this presentation.

750
00:56:19,070 --> 00:56:21,850
For references search, you can go to the library.

751
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:26,630
You know where it is, right?

752
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:37,800
You didn't remove the name tag?

753
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,870
It's hard to do so.

754
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:45,650
What?
What is it?

755
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:50,580
Please, go ahead.

756
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:52,680
Will it be fine?

757
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,910
And if it isn't?

758
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:57,590
Let's go.

759
00:58:03,990 --> 00:58:05,870
Here.

760
00:58:05,870 --> 00:58:09,750
Already finished?
You could have done it tomorrow.

761
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:12,460
Tomorrow, I won't be there.

762
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:15,660
Didn't you say you're coming till tomorrow?

763
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:18,650
It's just, I'm thinking not to come.

764
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:23,570
You do what you want, right?

765
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:25,980
Lee Tae Ho

766
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:29,700
I will return this uniform now.

767
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,990
So...

768
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:45,470
- Wait for me.
- Don't follow me.

769
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:50,910
Wait for me.

770
00:58:59,090 --> 00:59:00,220
Sorry.

771
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:02,240
You have to be ready for Seoul University, right?
Sorry.

772
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:09,730
Where are you?

773
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:12,590
There.

774
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:15,130
Group 4: Yoo Soo Bin, Kwon Da Huin,
Yoon So Ye and Choi Joon Woo

775
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:21,570
You are taking so long.

776
00:59:21,570 --> 00:59:23,420
I'm coming.

777
00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:28,960
- Where are you?
- Wait! I'm on 4.

778
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:36,770
Choi Joon Woo apology

779
01:00:19,370 --> 01:00:21,850
You have skills for drawing.

780
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,870
The ladybug is cute.

781
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:40,210
Can you stand there one second?

782
01:00:40,210 --> 01:00:41,890
Why?

783
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:56,990
Don't move.

784
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:02,850
I won't bite.

785
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:09,630
Transfer student, are you a ghost?

786
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:13,320
You are colorless.

787
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:17,720
Don't you feel wronged,
living while not having a sense of presence?

788
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,320
Done.

789
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:24,970
Good. Look, okay?

790
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,550
Thank you.

791
01:01:38,550 --> 01:01:41,040
Wait, I'm not finished.

792
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:54,220
What is your name?

793
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:56,390
Choi Joon Woo.

794
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:03,990
You can smile.

795
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:10,370
Goodbye, Transfer student.
All the best.

796
01:02:10,370 --> 01:02:14,100
Keep living like that, without a sense of presence.

797
01:02:24,590 --> 01:02:27,570
Choi Joon Woo

798
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:45,030
Do I need to have a sense of presence and stuff like that?

799
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:48,900
In all my life, I have never cared about that.

800
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:53,440
What am I supposed to do all of a sudden?

801
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:10,990
Really?

802
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:13,880
Joon Woo really stole it?

803
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:16,090
Yes, it seems like it.

804
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:19,550
Hey, no way.

805
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:25,130
I did not want to believe he stole it
but Sang Hoon said he saw him.

806
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:28,150
Jo Sang Hoon from the class next door?

807
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:29,710
Yes.

808
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:41,460
Joon Woo, are you leaving?

809
01:03:42,790 --> 01:03:46,190
I explained everything to the teacher.
Let's wait and see.

810
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:49,330
I have a tutoring session.
See you tomorrow.

811
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,770
Do you have something to say to me?

812
01:04:06,450 --> 01:04:08,530
What is it about?

813
01:04:11,070 --> 01:04:14,390
Joon Woo, I'm going to be late.
Let's talk tomorrow.

814
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:16,400
Sorry.

815
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,670
Ma Hui Yeong.

816
01:04:18,670 --> 01:04:20,300
What?

817
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:26,290
Joon Woo, you see—

818
01:04:26,290 --> 01:04:28,290
Why are you lying?

819
01:04:28,290 --> 01:04:29,970
What?

820
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:33,610
What are your talking about?

821
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:36,630
It was you.

822
01:04:38,410 --> 01:04:39,900
You stole it.

823
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:41,650
Stole what?

824
01:04:42,730 --> 01:04:44,700
Mr. Oh's watch?

825
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:52,230
Joon Woo, don't be like that.
I will help you, I said.

826
01:04:52,230 --> 01:04:53,700
So calm down—

827
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:57,220
That day, when you followed me,

828
01:04:57,220 --> 01:05:01,250
you found and took the watch in the trash.

829
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:04,530
Do you think I did not know?

830
01:05:06,450 --> 01:05:08,530
What are you saying?

831
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:12,830
- Hui Yeong!
- This punk!

832
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:19,850
What will you do?
What will you do if it really was me?

833
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:25,370
I want to hear the truth.

834
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:29,580
Why you're trying to blame me for what you did.

835
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:34,940
What will you do?
What will you do if it really was me, you trash!

836
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:45,260
Trash?
Isn't that you?

837
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:50,250
What?
This punk.

838
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:53,610
Trash?

839
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:18,610
Moment at Eighteen
~ Preview ~

840
01:06:18,610 --> 01:06:21,940
Joon Woo, be honest with me. I already know it.

841
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:24,740
It's true.
That delivery boy...

842
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:26,000
Did you really have to do this?

843
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,520
You're pissed off too.
You got stepped on, so you're reacting!

844
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:29,930
Fine!
Run away then!

845
01:06:29,930 --> 01:06:30,950
Shouldn't you do what you have to do

846
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:33,430
before leaving?

847
01:06:33,430 --> 01:06:35,980
Dad, where are you living?

848
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:39,950
I'm not running away. Why do I have

849
01:06:39,950 --> 01:06:41,130
to run away?

850
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:43,990
Fine to get treated however by whomever.

851
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:47,360
I have pity... for people like you.

852
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:49,480
I'm sorry, Mom.
