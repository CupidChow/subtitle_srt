1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,530
Keep drinking.
I'll bring the phone.

2
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,350
I think it's the housekeeper.

3
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:02,000
Joon Woo!

4
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,570
Mom.

5
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,950
Come here.

6
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,710
So, you two...

7
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:33,790
So that's why you asked about my first love last time.

8
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,500
Are you two...?

9
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:43,500
Yes, we are.
Hello. I'm Yoo Soo Bin.

10
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,060
Of course, I know you. Soo Bin.

11
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:54,620
I was going to tell you but it
hasn't been long since we started dating.

12
00:01:54,620 --> 00:02:00,770
Yes, and there were a couple of incidents.

13
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:08,040
Congrats, guys! Congrats, Joon Woo!

14
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:13,790
You two are really dating? Right?

15
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,870
Congratulations!
Congratulations so much!

16
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:29,330
Let me see you, Soo Bin.
You're my Joon Woo's first love.

17
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:37,120
Thank you for being Joon Woo's first love.

18
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,670
Oh, why am I starting to tear up?

19
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:54,860
The fact that this amazing friend
became Joon Woo's girlfriend. I'm so happy

20
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,220
Thank you.

21
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:04,900
But Mom, what happened?

22
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,200
Why are they the same?

23
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:30,770
I was planning on not taking the job
at first and Soo Bin's mom also was against it.

24
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:38,200
But when you think about it, a job is just a job.

25
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,270
While my diner is being remodeled,
I didn't want to just mess around,

26
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,780
but I still should've thought about my son.

27
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,270
I was too careless, right?

28
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:59,510
And with Soo Bin being your girlfriend now,
what should we do? It's not good, is it?

29
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:05,370
I'm fine.
I was just worried you might've had a hard time.

30
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:10,330
It's not tiring at all.

31
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:17,180
I usually like to cook, clean, and drive. It's right up my alley.

32
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,870
I have to go.
I have to pick up Soo Bin's mom.

33
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,890
- Soo Bin's mom doesn't know you two are dating, right?
- No, she doesn't.

34
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:35,030
Tell her.
I wish you could date freely.

35
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,930
And I feel bad that I'm the only one who knows.

36
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:43,140
I will... but not right away.

37
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:48,510
Right?
You need some time to prepare?

38
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:53,660
- But still, don't take too long. Okay?
- Yes.

39
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:58,330
- I'm leaving now. Have a great time at your job, Joon Woo.
- And you drive safely, Mom.

40
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:01,010
Okay!

41
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,080
Go.

42
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,310
Joon Woo! Sincerely, congratulations!
My son's first love!

43
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:16,380
First love!

44
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,490
Go.

45
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,490
Mom.

46
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,950
Episode 12
Being more than an adult at the age of eighteen

47
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:51,030
It looks like I couldn't come with you
because my mom showed up. She just left.

48
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:54,020
Are your hiccups completely gone?

49
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,540
Yeah, completely gone.

50
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,040
That's right.

51
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,100
Soo Bin.

52
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:13,290
I felt bothered, so I was on my way
to come find you at your job, but you're right here.

53
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:21,020
I'm sorry. I really didn't know.

54
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:27,970
Why are you sorry?
My mom was just working.

55
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,680
Is it awkward for you?

56
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:42,360
- I'm really fine.
- If you're fine, then I'm fine.

57
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:51,300
I'm happy my mom likes you,
even though I already figured she would.

58
00:06:54,920 --> 00:07:01,100
But your mom is really, really great.
She's like a young woman.

59
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:08,900
Right?
Also, my mom said it would be good to tell your mom.

60
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,780
She said that she feels bad being the only one to know.

61
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,730
I guess that's true.

62
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,610
Thanks for seeing me off.

63
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:39,290
- Take care.
- I'll take care thinking about you.

64
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,350
- I'm going now.
- Okay.

65
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,280
Go.

66
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,690
Yes.

67
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:59,300
- Bye.
- Go safely.

68
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:49,530
Why are you so late?
What were you doing?

69
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,550
I went to the library because of performance evaluation.

70
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:58,330
You should've called, then I could have sent the car.
Are you tired?

71
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,750
- Yes.
- Yeah. Look now.

72
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,730
There's some strange post.

73
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:16,480
2nd-grade 3rd class Ma Hui Yeong
is suspected of manipulating grades.

74
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,330
What are they talking about?

75
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:40,860
Ma Hui Yeong, is this real?

76
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,530
No way. Why would first place
in the whole school manipulate anything?

77
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,830
Couldn't he have become first place
because of the manipulation?

78
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,720
Could this be real?

79
00:09:56,090 --> 00:10:00,020
It seems to be too factual to be a rumor.

80
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,780
Oh!

81
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,980
Romi...

82
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:17,390
Gi Tae, is this true?

83
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:23,050
Nothing's been confirmed yet.
Let's just study for now.

84
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,670
I was just curious.

85
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,910
- Yes, yes.
- We're figuring it out right now.

86
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,960
- We don't know the source.
- Say we're looking into it.

87
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:42,580
We're looking into it right now, Mother, yes.
Don't worry too much.

88
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,350
Hello, Mother. Yes.

89
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,710
Yes, we're looking into it now.

90
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,550
Teacher Oh!
Have you seen this?

91
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:56,190
Yes, I just did. I was in the classroom.

92
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:59,850
Teacher Ha, what are you doing?
Hurry and delete it now.

93
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:03,230
Wait, excuse me.
I don't think we should just delete it.

94
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,370
Anything that’s false can be deleted by the moderator.

95
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,920
Yes, I know but I think it’ll only make it more suspicious.

96
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,980
For now, we should release an official
announcement and then decide if we should delete—

97
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:19,450
The kids are fast.
It's already spread everywhere.

98
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,690
This is no joke.

99
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,250
Even the alumni know.

100
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:29,270
It'll die soon.
This happened last year, too.

101
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:35,180
My grandma said that if someone farts then there's also poop. What did Hui Yeong say?

102
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:39,520
Oh, right.
You guys aren't on good terms, right?

103
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:43,350
What about Gi Tae?
Oh, right. You too.

104
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:49,290
What about Oh Je?
Oh, right. You too.

105
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:54,600
Why are you all like this?
Kwon Da Huin, go home.

106
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,800
We're all feeling down because of you.

107
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,210
My house is busy right now
because my relatives are here.

108
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,480
I just want to stay here.

109
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,730
No, is my house some kind of a nursing home?

110
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:14,220
Hui Yeong

111
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,930
Stop looking at it.
There's no point.

112
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,850
Nothing happened, right?
Without me knowing?

113
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:39,950
No. Nothing happened.
Don't be concerned.

114
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:43,040
Just study.

115
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,220
You shouldn't be concerned about it either.

116
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:53,120
- Stop drinking.
- I didn't. I had juice.

117
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,730
Study.

118
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,110
Oh! Miss Yeon Woo. You waited a long time.
Did you bring what I asked you?

119
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:08,120
Have you seen the bulletin?
The moms are going crazy.

120
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,580
Leave them be.
When Hui Yeong gets number one again,

121
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:15,010
it'll be filled with compliments.

122
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:17,540
Oh! You got your cast off.

123
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,340
I did.
That's why I was late.

124
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,430
Wow, then you won't need me anymore.

125
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:26,670
Why not? We still have time left.

126
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:29,160
Yes, but you're recovered now.

127
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,250
It's still uncomfortable.
Help me a little longer.

128
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,930
So, I think my son has a girlfr—

129
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,930
- Omo! What to do!
- Did a mouse come out? Where?

130
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:44,690
It’s not a mouse.
How can he already be dating?

131
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:48,520
He'll be a senior next year.
You're in trouble.

132
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,770
What will you do? Oh dear.

133
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:55,260
Yeah, it is a problem.

134
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:20,260
- Did you finish your part-time job?
- Yeah.

135
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,670
- Finished prep?
- Yeah.

136
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:27,760
You worked hard.
See you tomorrow.

137
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,270
Okay.

138
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,920
But,

139
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,750
you're acting like you don't know.
Even though you must have seen it.

140
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,160
Do I have to act like I know?

141
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:55,110
Honestly, I can't be nice to you.

142
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,450
I know.

143
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:12,660
He acts tough, but he's more fragile than others.

144
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:18,130
You really are a teacher. Even after you got
that annoyed about Hui Yeong's mother,

145
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:23,510
you're worrying about him.
Do you know you've been worrying about him this whole time?

146
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:28,560
Was I?
Sorry. It must've been boring for you.

147
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,070
- A little.
- A little?

148
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:39,610
My mom also wanted me to always be first.

149
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:43,080
Why can't you get a perfect score?
Raise your head. Raise your head!

150
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,300
Did I not say you have to get a perfect score and be

151
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:50,130
first place to survive in this world?
Oh Han Gyeol!

152
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:54,130
She was such a scary and hysterical mom to me,

153
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:58,460
but she seemed so unhappy.

154
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:05,790
So I worked hard to make her happy,
but in the end, I didn't do so well.

155
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:13,630
Later, even attending school became so difficult so
I dropped out in eighth grade.

156
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:18,760
In the end, I couldn't go to the college
she wanted me to go to.

157
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:26,050
As I grew up, I hated her so much.

158
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:31,360
But she passed away when
I was in university due to complications.

159
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,460
After that, I felt very regretful.

160
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:46,070
The mom who pressured me so hard
didn't have a good outcome.

161
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:49,260
The Han Gyeol from that time
didn't have a good outcome, either.

162
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:59,160
Sorry. Whoa, I'm making it awkward.

163
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,850
Teach. Your mom will be really proud

164
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:07,260
because you became such an amazing teacher.

165
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,250
- You think so?
- Of course.

166
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:15,770
"Aigoo, my Han Gyeol is doing so well,"
is probably what she'd say.

167
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:19,160
I... I really hope so.

168
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,770
It was probably his old homeroom teacher.

169
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,430
We gave so much to him, what more did he want?

170
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:31,330
No, the person who posted that
could've been Teacher Oh Han Gyeol.

171
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:34,890
- We should just switch the homeroom teacher.
- How can we do that again?

172
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:39,020
You put up such a fuss and you want to do it again?

173
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:44,060
- What does that mean?
- What did you do at school for such a post to go online?

174
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:48,680
Did something happen with the previous teacher?
Then the reason why he was injured...

175
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,320
- What do you mean, something?
- And what about Teacher Oh Han Gyeol also?

176
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,830
- What did you two do?
- Don't you know it was all for you?

177
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:00,620
If you had done well on your own,
why would I have had to suck up to others?

178
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,020
Dear.

179
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:07,150
Hui Yeong, let's go upstairs.

180
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,330
There's someone else I'm suspicious of.

181
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:15,100
- Who?
- The one that you like. Maeng Soo.

182
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:20,660
Ma Hui Yeong's mentality is probably in shreds.

183
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:32,940
It would be nice if my mom told your mom.

184
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:36,190
She feels sorry that only she knows.

185
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:53,680
Hey. That... no.

186
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:58,550
You know the son of the mom who works for me?
He has a girlfriend.

187
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:03,270
Can you believe it?
He's really not a bright one.

188
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:09,670
His mom is suffering like that,
but he can pretty much kiss university goodbye.

189
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:16,610
Hey, Yoo Soo Bin.
You have to study really hard.

190
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:19,060
You have to do well on your finals.

191
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:24,480
You can't forget about how Hui Yeong's mom
took you out of the math prep class

192
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,370
because you're not at their level. Okay?

193
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,930
What? You have something to say?

194
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:36,600
I... I'm just thirsty.

195
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,830
Drink water.

196
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:42,120
If that thing on the board about the raccoon is true,

197
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,570
that would be great so she'll go down.

198
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,890
Soo Bin.

199
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:11,580
Let's go.

200
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,790
Hi, Hui Yeong!

201
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:30,410
The icon of exams.
Oh! It's the final exams. Finals.

202
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:33,710
You are being suspicious of me, right?

203
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:37,750
It's not me.
Why would I upload such thing on the message board?

204
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,540
You made it so that my dad gets promoted
and that I don't have to transfer.

205
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:44,890
You even included me in your royal tutoring
which I couldn't get in even if I died.

206
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:49,080
Why would I do such a thing to
a friend that I am so grateful to?

207
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,590
Jo Sang Hoon.

208
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:55,220
What's this Lee Gi Tae?
I thought you were fired as the butler of Ma Hui Yeong?

209
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:59,550
Hey Lee Gi Tae.
Just go on your way.

210
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:04,480
Wow.

211
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:09,670
What's this?
Is this a broken friendship of some sort?

212
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:12,520
This has turned in a fun way.

213
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,880
Hui Yeong, I'll be your best friend now.

214
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,750
Why? I will be good.
I'll be good, Hui Yeong.

215
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:34,200
Don't worry. I ran into Hui Yeong after
my work yesterday and he said he doesn't mind.

216
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,540
Let's go.

217
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,010
- Are you following Choi Joon Woo?
- This worked for Choi Joon Woo.

218
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:47,300
Hey, that...
You must have given up on Ro Mi. What is that?

219
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,230
Jerk! I'm being sincere.

220
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:53,120
She sure would be so happy if you gave that.

221
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,890
Your drawing looks so light for being sincere.

222
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:02,690
Yoo Pil Sang, give it to me.

223
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,980
Give it.

224
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:10,590
Hey, first you get the line.

225
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:15,540
Like this. You see the line is done.

226
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:20,220
Oh my world.
Choi Joon Woo, you draw well.

227
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:24,700
Now, you need to save the highlight.

228
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:29,270
- What is Ro Mi's highlight?
- Her face is small and her eyes are pretty.

229
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:33,240
- Ohhh! Choi Joon Woo.
- And?

230
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:37,100
She has a lot of eye fat.

231
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,180
And she has bangs like mine.

232
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,700
Okay.

233
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:50,670
Da Huin, let's go and eat.
You will faint at this rate.

234
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:54,270
Kwon Da Huin, are you like this because of a mere man?

235
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:57,240
You should date someone better to get revenge!

236
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,110
Yeah, I am pathetic!
Do you even know about love?

237
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:04,460
You only know how to lie so
what do you know about love?

238
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,760
Who are you!

239
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,270
Who the hell are you!

240
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:10,720
Hey! Jeong Oh Je!

241
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,960
- What are you?
- Ro Mi.

242
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,050
Who are you that Kwon Da Huin is starving herself!
Who are you to make her like that!

243
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:22,590
Hey Hwang Ro Mi!
Why are you hitting Oh Je?

244
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:25,580
You should just talk to me, so why hit Oh Je?

245
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:30,860
You saw that, right? Take responsibility.
If you received much love you you should at least do this.

246
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:35,820
Just because it's not your feelings that's why you
just do whatever you want? That's sh*t manners.

247
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,440
Da Huin...

248
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:49,890
Kwon Da Huin still has energy.
She won't die.

249
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:56,660
- Teacher, I wish you would be honest.
- About what?

250
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:00,800
- About what my parents did wrong.
- Huh?

251
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,460
About the petition to change homeroom teachers,
I'm sorry about that.

252
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:11,320
Don't be. The mother did it with the hopes
that you would study better.

253
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,090
And it was dismissed right away.

254
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:19,610
You're a bit off since such that type
of post was uploaded on the message board, right?

255
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:24,270
Do you also suspect me?

256
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:31,750
No.
I believe in you.

257
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:38,150
But Hui Yeong, if and only if...

258
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:42,830
even if something unexpected were to happen.

259
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:48,050
It won't be because it's your fault.

260
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,900
I didn't do anything wrong.

261
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:57,030
I know. I know that.

262
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:05,910
- Have you eaten? Should we eat together?
- No, I will get going.

263
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,270
The teacher went to a meeting so
I will relay the announcements.

264
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:27,410
There's nothing special. Just that the
updated performance evaluation has been posted.

265
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:32,000
President, the thing about the grades isn't true, right?

266
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,690
Did it come up again?

267
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,180
What do you think about it?

268
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:48,630
Just... I'm curious.

269
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,570
Let's get ready for class.

270
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:40,080
Well. In this situation,
it's important to keep it quiet from the start, Teachers.

271
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,550
This can't get big.

272
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,530
Should we give an official explanation?

273
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:47,430
No. Nothing of that sort happened
so why would we need to explain?

274
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:52,690
Teacher Han Gyeol, you should control the children
so that the class atmosphere won't shatter.

275
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:55,540
And the same goes for all the other teachers
with your respective classes.

276
00:26:55,540 --> 00:27:01,430
You should make sure they keep quiet.
You need to make that certain.

277
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:08,560
Da Huin's breakup recovery project starts now.

278
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,350
Hello, everyone.
My name is Kwon Da HuIn.

279
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:15,810
I just broke up with my boyfriend a few days ago.

280
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,500
What about Da Huin?
Is she okay?

281
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:38,760
Everyone is worried about her. It's hard.

282
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:43,880
Let's cheer up.
This. Ginseng.

283
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,530
I drink that when I study.
I brought it for you to drink.

284
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:49,450
Thank you.

285
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:03,840
This is a bit packed.

286
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:09,860
But we still need to. We need to have our grades up even though we are dating so that I would have something to say to my mom.

287
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:13,090
I will really do well in this exam.

288
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:22,560
Don't be too stressed.
If you set out to hard to do well, there will be side effects.

289
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:29,580
No. I need to do well.
I also made a promise to your mom too.

290
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:33,050
That I would be honest to my mom.

291
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:37,000
Let's do that.

292
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:41,970
What's this?

293
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:46,930
We are hiding, and I can't even tell her we are dating.

294
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:50,840
It's not like it's the Joseon dynasty.

295
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,560
Because we are eighteen.

296
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:58,530
What's with being eighteen?
Is it a sin?

297
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:01,390
Is it a sin to like each other?

298
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:04,020
It could be?

299
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,530
Why?

300
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:15,170
Because on the brightest moment,
we discovered what is the brightest.

301
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,780
That could be a sin.

302
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:26,820
You... honestly you came from the future, right?

303
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:31,330
You are about 1029 years old,

304
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:36,370
and you thought that this moment
was the brightest so you came here, right?

305
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:41,240
- This is trouble.
- Why? Why?

306
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:48,290
You... how did you know?

307
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:50,510
About my identity.

308
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,890
Sit down.

309
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,770
Sit down.

310
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:02,890
What should we do about this?

311
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:12,100
Instead, should we just... go ahead?

312
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,660
Just tell her we are dating.

313
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:20,120
Not run away and not lie.

314
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:24,680
"We are dating. We are dating."
Just...

315
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:28,310
No. I don't like to go forward recklessly.

316
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,010
I also don't like shrinking in fear.

317
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:37,580
We are always hiding in the woods in my neighborhood.

318
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:43,850
I am not shrinking in fear.
It's fun, hiding.

319
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:53,410
But still... I'm sorry and it makes me sad.

320
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:08,300
It's good, but it's strange.

321
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,980
What is?

322
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,810
Sigh.

323
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,680
Me too.

324
00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:01,270
It's my dad. My dad. Dad.
This is great. You should greet him.

325
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:08,810
- Right now?
- My dad is different from my mom so he would understand.

326
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,590
- Wait.
- Okay.

327
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,250
He hung up.

328
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:20,400
I will call him again.

329
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:26,950
Yes, Soo Bin. I...

330
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,780
I told you to not contact Soo Bin, didn't I?

331
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,620
Seriously, your controlling ways.

332
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:37,570
I don't have much time.
What is it you want to talk about? Hurry.

333
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:41,890
Here.
The divorce papers.

334
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,490
No. Is that all?

335
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:50,810
- Hey, Yoon Song Hee.
- Let go of me.

336
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:56,280
- We don't love each other.
- What? What did you say?

337
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,780
We don't love each other.

338
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,240
Oh my.

339
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:04,950
Are you 18?
Do you still believe in love?

340
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:09,030
Then what?
Keep living uncomfortably like this?

341
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:11,840
I'm not.
You're probably the one that's uncomfortable.

342
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,120
Shouldn’t you pay for it
with at least that much discomfort?

343
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,060
Hey, Song Hee.

344
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:19,940
Even if we keep this up, you'll just be consumed.

345
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:23,330
In that case, I'm happy to see you consumed too.

346
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:25,200
Mr. Yoo Jong Soo.

347
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:28,970
Try living well under a rock.

348
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:32,390
And also, if you sue,
you know that you're at a disadvantage right?

349
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:34,610
Because you're the one who is at fault.

350
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:40,360
Let's maintain our dignity, Soo Bin's dad.

351
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,170
I'm leaving now.

352
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:53,380
- Your meeting ended quickly.
- Yes.

353
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,920
They came together?

354
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,650
Should I run them over?

355
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,960
What are you doing?

356
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,310
What are you doing??

357
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:42,810
Oh my gosh, why are you being like this?!

358
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:49,570
Are you really crazy?!

359
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:16,160
Wow, my daughter.
You seem to be studying hard.

360
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,270
I promised it to you, Mom.

361
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:20,960
- Cookie?
- Yes.

362
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,670
My driver gave it to me for you to eat.

363
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:30,420
Your arm's all healed now.
Do you still need a driver?

364
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,320
I wanted to pretend like it's still hurt
and spend more time with her,

365
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,930
but she's done now.

366
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:38,730
She's going back to her old job.

367
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:43,530
It looks like you've gotten closer to your driver.

368
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:45,020
Yes.

369
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,390
I feel at ease when I'm around her.

370
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:49,140
We decided to be friends.

371
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,390
Is that so?

372
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:52,230
Yes.

373
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,950
- Keep studying.
- Yes.

374
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:09,140
I think our moms have gotten closer.

375
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,830
This is good news for us, right?

376
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,670
Right.

377
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,930
Now, Mr. Choi Joon Woo,
you just need to do well on your finals.

378
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:28,450
Fighting.

379
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:30,950
Okay. Don't worry about it.

380
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:35,430
♬ This night is passing by quickly ♬

381
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:38,660
♬ And I'm okay with that ♬

382
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:43,670
♬ Drawing your face in my mind ♬

383
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:48,070
Final Exam Schedule
♬ And hearing your voice ♬

384
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:51,480
This is good.
This is good. This is good.

385
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:09,620
This person cannot come to the phone—

386
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:12,710
That's weird, Ms. Ji Min.

387
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:17,470
She hasn't been picking up her phone all day.
Does she have exams today?

388
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:22,760
Hui Yeong. ls everything all right?

389
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:27,200
If you have anything you need to discuss,
call me anytime.

390
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:32,550
Thank you.

391
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:36,020
What a dry person.

392
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,940
He could've at least used emoticons.

393
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,730
Hyung.

394
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:58,520
What should I do?

395
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,970
I'm scared.

396
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,310
Yes.

397
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,970
I'm on my way home from my part-time job.

398
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,140
What about you, Mom?

399
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,230
Did you arrive well?

400
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:15,220
You must have had a lot to work on.

401
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,520
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

402
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:22,820
Mom, are you crying again?

403
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,600
You aren't , right?

404
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,960
Don't worry.

405
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,110
I will do well on my own.

406
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,190
Yes.

407
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:20,700
Do you still sleep with your lights on?

408
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,760
Well...

409
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:28,960
Try practicing sleeping with your lights off.
You can fix it.

410
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,990
Then...

411
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:38,070
Imagine I'm next to you.
Together.

412
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:41,920
- Together...
- Yes,

413
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,990
That I'm next to you, watching over you.

414
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:59,000
Did you turn your lights off?

415
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,260
Yes.

416
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:02,960
Are you able to fall asleep?

417
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,790
It's hard.

418
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:07,550
Even though I'm watching over you?

419
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:10,630
That's making it harder.

420
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,430
Why?

421
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:14,990
When I imagine you're next to me,

422
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:17,070
it make me feel excited.

423
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:22,330
Don't worry.
I'll help you fall asleep.

424
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:26,870
Now, close your eyes.

425
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:29,080
You are feeling sleepy.

426
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:32,560
It's fine, you're fine.

427
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:35,660
You're relaxed.

428
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,750
You're relaxed.

429
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:48,980
♬ The day on which a small door opened ♬

430
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:54,260
♬ and the world changed ♬

431
00:40:54,260 --> 00:41:00,180
♬ was all about my feeling of happiness ♬

432
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:03,740
♬ It is blindingly bright. ♬

433
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:09,130
♬ I who am extending my insignificant hand ♬

434
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:20,520
♬ cautiously express hello with feeling ♬

435
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,580
You're doing well.

436
00:41:55,930 --> 00:42:00,530
Correct. Wow!
I'm proud!

437
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:05,100
I'm so gratified!

438
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:15,170
Sorry.
It's because I'm so happy you're doing well.

439
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:24,700
Are we reenacting the story of
Princess Pyeong Gang and On Dal, the fool?

440
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:31,510
What are you talking about? We're just studying
together and I'm proud you're doing well.

441
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:34,200
So that's the origin of you feeling fulfilled?

442
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:38,770
That is your nickname.

443
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:42,330
Joon Dal.
Not On Dal. Joon Dal.

444
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:47,310
I am the bean and you are Joon Dal.

445
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:50,700
Joon Dal. Joon Dal.
Adorable.

446
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:56,200
Joon Dal. Joon Dal. Joon Dal.

447
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:02,310
Joon Dal.

448
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:27,230
I love you.

449
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,080
Okay.

450
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:34,900
That's not fair.

451
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:39,700
I got a call suddenly during cleaning time.

452
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:44,350
You should've told me after then,
so I could prepare myself.

453
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:47,920
I was worried you wouldn't be able
to study while preparing yourself.

454
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,710
Instead, we got to study hard for two hours.

455
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:56,300
That was to be expected of Princess Pyeong Gang.

456
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:00,090
I'll talk with my dad first and then I'll text you later.
You can come in then.

457
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:04,080
- Alright?
- Yes.

458
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:10,110
Let's do this.

459
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:21,670
Hello. I'm Choi Joon Woo.

460
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:25,280
Hello. I'm Choi Joon Woo.

461
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,240
- Soo Bin, have you been doing well?
- Yes.

462
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:37,690
- Studying has been hard, right?
- It's hard, it's even harder because of Mom.

463
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:42,820
Gosh. Soo Bin

464
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:47,920
I have something to tell you today.

465
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,280
Like what?

466
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:59,940
I want to get a divorce from your mom.

467
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:02,930
Oh...

468
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:10,000
I thought it'd be best to tell you honestly.

469
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:19,260
You were starting to notice too, right?
That your mom and I weren't getting along?

470
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:24,090
Oh my...

471
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:29,420
I have no right to look at you.

472
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:40,470
But I don't want to pretend to be close anymore.

473
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:44,110
That's why I want a divorce from your mom.

474
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:50,140
However, your mom is against it
because she says you'll be shocked.

475
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:58,600
Soo Bin. From what I can tell,
you're not a young girl anymore.

476
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:03,340
You're 18 now.
I think you're at a point where you can understand.

477
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:06,240
You're going to be an adult soon.

478
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:11,190
Right, Soo Bin?

479
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:14,160
What?

480
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:18,730
I'm right, right? You understand?

481
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:26,160
It must be so easy for adults.

482
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:29,850
What?

483
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:34,850
To us... sometimes you ask,

484
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:38,060
"What does a young kid like you know?"

485
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:42,710
and tell us just to study. But other times you say,

486
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:48,110
"You're all grown up now and it's time for you to understand."

487
00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:53,230
By their own whim. At their own will.

488
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,510
No, Soo Bin, that's because...

489
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:25,530
You have always been more mature and deep,
unlike the other kids. So—

490
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:33,220
It's not like that, Dad.
I was just pretending to be mature,

491
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:38,570
because if I did that, you and Mom would be comfortable

492
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:42,430
because you would've been less sorry.

493
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:46,600
But...

494
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:49,490
truthfully ...

495
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:54,640
I didn't want to be like that.

496
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:15,440
- You're here?
- Let's go.

497
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:20,360
My dad said he didn't have time today
so you can just meet him later.

498
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:24,300
Okay. Did you have a good talk?

499
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,600
Yes.

500
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,130
You have work today, right?

501
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:39,440
Yes, but should we skip today and go have fun?

502
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:44,200
No. You need to go to your part-time job.

503
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:47,700
Just for today.
Let's just have fun today.

504
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,110
♬ For many of my days ♬

505
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:15,020
♬ I wish you would stay ♬

506
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:20,270
♬ Even if the day is not significant ♬

507
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:24,680
♬ You, who soothed my feelings  ♬

508
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:28,850
♬ and told me it's all rignt, ♬

509
00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:34,710
♬ I really need you ♬

510
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:05,800
- Joon Woo.
- Yes?

511
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:12,010
What do you regret the most in your life?

512
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:19,120
I'm not sure.
There are so many things.

513
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:25,410
Just one.
The one that bothers you the most in your mind.

514
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:37,160
That I couldn't reveal myself?

515
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:47,740
Before, when I was considering moving schools again

516
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:52,750
I went to my dad's house.

517
00:50:55,510 --> 00:51:00,680
I already knew where he was living but
I wasn't able to go looking for him.

518
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:13,320
Since I'm running away, I thought I might as well do it

519
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:17,580
But my dad didn't...

520
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:19,660
You...

521
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:26,380
- You don't know me?
- What?

522
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:29,400
He couldn't seem to recognize me.

523
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:35,360
That's what I regret.

524
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:43,240
Going to see him?

525
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:50,000
At that moment...

526
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:56,850
that I couldn't tell him, "I am Choi Joon Woo."

527
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:05,640
It felt like I was being erased at that moment.

528
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:18,680
I kept regretting it, but it felt strange to go back.

529
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:23,340
Let's go back and tell him,

530
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,680
so you don't have any regrets, okay?

531
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,820
Would you like that?

532
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:41,560
If you regret it.

533
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:48,400
Okay.

534
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:54,030
Can you take a look at it first?

535
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,610
You even drew a picture?

536
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,590
Yes, a little one.

537
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:03,510
You did well.

538
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,930
Let's go.

539
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:04,660
Now for all your regrets to disappear.

540
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:21,100
Are you feeling better now?

541
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:22,590
What?

542
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:26,590
Because I got rid of my regret.

543
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:33,200
You have something you regret,
so you were getting vicarious satisfaction through me.

544
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:36,150
You knew...?

545
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:41,420
Something bad happened when you met your dad, right?

546
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:49,540
Did you do this to make me feel better?

547
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:53,530
I was going to do this someday anyway.

548
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:55,750
Little by little.

549
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:04,970
To make you feel better as well.

550
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:14,750
Aren't you hungry?

551
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:23,750
I'm having a hard time without you around.

552
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:26,020
It's true.

553
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:28,240
You probably want to see your son.

554
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:33,020
There's nothing I can do.
And we've been living like this every day.

555
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:39,610
I miss Joon Woo and I miss you, too.

556
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:43,550
If you miss me, come visit.
I'll buy you a delicious meal.

557
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:48,200
Okay, good luck.

558
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:12,010
It's a railroad.

559
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,790
Pretty, right?

560
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:21,990
It's like a different world.

561
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:29,090
It is a different world.
The world I live in.

562
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:31,030
I came here before.

563
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:32,250
What?

564
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:36,260
Last time, when I didn't trust you.

565
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:43,680
I've always wanted to come up.

566
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,350
It's nice.

567
00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:46,930
Is that your room?

568
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,150
I'm curious.

569
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:55,390
My room... next time.

570
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:57,640
It's so messy.

571
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:03,960
Sit down here.

572
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:27,620
Thanks.

573
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:30,010
- I'll enjoy this food.
- I'll enjoy this food.

574
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:35,000
Right now, the thing I regret the most...

575
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:40,780
In the past...
when my parents said they were getting a divorce...

576
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:43,570
and I stopped them from doing it.

577
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:54,490
Don't go, Mom.

578
00:57:54,490 --> 00:57:57,880
Don't go. Don't go. Mom...

579
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,310
I told you we were getting a divorce.

580
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:02,820
No. I can't understand.

581
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:04,760
Mom, don't go. Okay?

582
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:10,710
Even if we divorce,
your dad and I will always be friends and

583
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:15,410
you, Soo Bin, are the daughter we love most in the world.

584
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:19,450
I don't want to! I don't! Mom, I'll do well.

585
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:22,130
I'll work hard and go to a good college.

586
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:24,860
I made an agreement with Dad
and he said he'd do better, too.

587
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:27,750
Mom, don't go.

588
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:31,550
Please don't go.
Don't go.

589
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:33,940
Live with us.

590
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:38,920
Don't divorce.

591
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,860
Sorry.

592
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:46,250
I'm sorry.
I won't get a divorce.

593
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:48,770
Don't cry.

594
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:51,500
I'm sorry.

595
00:58:52,370 --> 00:58:56,840
Back then, I thought I was doing the right thing.

596
00:58:58,350 --> 00:59:03,160
I didn't even know that they were living
together against their will because of me.

597
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:08,870
Pretending to get along.
Leaving them to act.

598
00:59:10,730 --> 00:59:13,080
Later on, I found out...

599
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:16,770
that it was my fault.

600
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,340
What should I do now?

601
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,470
I can't turn it back.

602
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:30,400
Because of me...

603
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:42,210
It's not your fault.

604
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:46,960
You didn't know.
At that time,

605
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,980
you thought that was the best you could do.

606
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,770
Why I didn't know then?

607
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:03,650
I feel bad for Mom,

608
01:00:05,650 --> 01:00:08,140
and Dad isn't any better off.

609
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:08,850
What are you doing?

610
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:26,930
The girl you were dating is Soo Bin?

611
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:29,990
I...

612
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:35,510
Mom... I was going to tell you after finals.

613
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:37,480
Soo Bin.

614
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:41,260
What's this?

615
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:43,280
What's this?

616
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:47,350
What are you two doing?
Let go of her!

617
01:01:47,350 --> 01:01:52,460
What is this!
What are you doing right now!

618
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:55,200
What? What is this?!

619
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:08,810
♬ Everything fades away ♬

620
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:11,990

01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:15,470

Moment at Eighteen
~ Preview ~

624
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:22,460
Can I ask you something?

625
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:25,900
Nothing like that ever happened.

626
01:02:27,850 --> 01:02:29,980
I will not meet Soo Bin outside.

627
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:33,390
I will not talk to Soo Bin at school.

628
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:36,750
However, please let Soo Bin travel freely.

629
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:37,650
I ask this of you.

630
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:39,490
This place isn't a prison.

631
01:02:39,490 --> 01:02:41,110
I'm not a prison guard.

632
01:02:41,110 --> 01:02:43,630
Making the kids feel suffocated
and being involved in everything they do.

633
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:46,200
Checking up on their feelings
and making them feel the way you want them to!

634
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:49,020
Soo Bin. Let's try to endure this,

635
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:50,440
[Cheer up, tiny pea.]
even though it'll be hard.

636
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:53,070
We can work harder at school.

637
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:56,180
That's what I'll do.
I hope you also do the same.

638
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:57,210
I'm here for you.

639
01:02:57,210 --> 01:02:59,640
I don't think I can be first in the school.

640
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:02,260
So, please help me

641
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:03,480
I'll only trust you, Mom and Dad.

Driver, please go a little bit faster.

Hello. I'm Choi Joon Woo.
