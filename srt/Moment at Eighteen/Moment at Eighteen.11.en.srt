1
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,950
You don't have luggage?

2
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,590
So Ye, sit here.

3
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,680
Soo Bin, did you get my text?

4
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,980
Your mom called you, right?

5
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,350
Orientation for our new tutoring class is tomorrow.

6
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,900
Come to my house by 5:00.

7
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,900
Let's talk later.

8
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,450
Tutoring class.

9
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,490
Now, now.

10
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,660
My beloved people of Class 2-3.

11
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,050
We don't love you!

12
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:38,330
I love you more.
Are you already asleep, Pil Sang?

13
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:41,040
Now, President, Vice president,

14
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,270
did you make sure everyone's present?

15
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,330
Yes.

16
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:47,550
Now, now. Driver, we're all ready.

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,390
We ask for a safe drive.

18
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,720
- Okay.
- Thank you.

19
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,580
Let's go!

20
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,330
- Do that for me, too.
- Huh?

21
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,960
That's yours.

22
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:23,480
Episode 11:
Feelings I Got to Know Because of You

23
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,200
These kids, they played too hard.

24
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,870
Teacher Oh, please come see me
as soon as you arrive back at school.

25
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,390
I have something I need to discuss with you.

26
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,000
What I didn't send you last time...

27
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,350
I should have checked with you but I couldn't.

28
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,360
Because

29
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,730
even if that text was real,
I was afraid I'd continue to like you.

30
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:37,190
So I was embarrassed for you
to find out about those feelings.

31
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,500
- So was everyone happy?
- Yes.

32
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,270
Oh, so I was the only one?

33
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,760
You worked hard!
Go straight home now, okay?

34
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,130
Now, dismissed!

35
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,630
I'll get going first.

36
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,190
Soo Bin, congratulations.

37
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:11,140
The rumors have spread.
About you and Joon Woo.

38
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,370
Have beautiful love.

39
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,700
- I'm leaving.
- Are you going, Ro Mi?

40
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:24,370
Stop it now.

41
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,500
Take one each. Take it.

42
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,540
My partner.

43
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,130
Partner, don't you think we've become a little close?

44
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,990
One, two.

45
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,880
Promise me you'll read the tarot for me.

46
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,760
Oh Je, you want to go with?

47
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,520
I have to go work for my dad.

48
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,670
I'll get going.

49
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,280
Good bye!

50
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,240
Good bye!

51
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,690
Hey, are you sick?
Your face is totally red!

52
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,530
You're right.

53
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,840
Maybe because I forgot the sunscreen?

54
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,580
- You got sunburned.
- Let's go to the jjimjilbang (dry sauna). I'm sore.

55
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,820
Sure! Let's go.

56
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,840
Let's go to the sauna!

57
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,900
- Let's go.
- Let's all go.

58
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,850
I just want to go home. I'm tired.

59
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,710
What's with you? Let's just go.

60
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,360
Let's go!

61
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,160
Let's go! To get rid of travel fatigue!

62
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,160
We made a date to meet.

63
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,970
Want to go to the sauna with—

64
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,500
I want to spend time alone today.

65
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,140
It's okay, right?

66
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,530
It's fine.

67
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,560
Come on! Hurry up!

68
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,500
Kids are all gone.
Shall we go?

69
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,460
♬ The day on which a small door opened ♬

70
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:12,640
♬ and the world changed ♬

71
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:18,420
♬ was all about my feeling of happiness ♬

72
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,170
♬ It is blindingly bright. ♬

73
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:27,520
♬ I who am extending my insignificant hand ♬

74
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,370
♬ cautiously express hello with feeling ♬

75
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,720
They do come after all.
Moments like this.

76
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,980
Huh?

77
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,390
A moment where we're alone together.

78
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,740
We had a lot of moments like this.

79
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,950
We did, but I think this is the first time.

80
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,860
Really, totally.

81
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,390
A moment where it's just the two of us.

82
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,490
Soo Bin.

83
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,340
From now on, please take good care of me.

84
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,150
- Please take good care of me as well.
- Okay.

85
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,010
- Isn't it really good?
- Yes, who picked this place?

86
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,760
Oh?

87
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,600
Oh Je! What about deliveries?

88
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,700
I thought you went to the sauna.

89
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,430
We were on our way,
but I met my friends from junior high. Say hi.

90
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,780
Hello!

91
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,160
Are you Da Huin's first love?

92
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,100
- What do you like about her?
- How long have you been dating?

93
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,240
Take a picture with us.

94
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,020
Let's take photos.

95
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,810
One, two, three.

96
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,930
Just one more.

97
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,890
Thank you.

98
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,890
Kwon Da Huin.

99
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:06,000
Why are you saying my last name, too, all of a sudden?
Because I suddenly brought my friends?

100
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,210
I mean, they wanted to meet you, so...

101
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,300
Just, I'm a little taken aback.

102
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,350
My classmates have raised a fuss because
the photos got spread around already.

103
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:16,660
Are you upset by any chance that people know we're dating?

104
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,700
It's not that—

105
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,720
Why? You don't feel comfortable telling your friends about me being your girlfriend?

106
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,780
Because I'm not pretty?

107
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,090
That's not the issue.

108
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,270
Also, you are pretty.
You're very pretty, but—

109
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,950
What?
So I was the only one making a big deal out of this?

110
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,800
I'm not saying that!

111
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,690
Are you angry?

112
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,580
You know how I'm a very shy person.

113
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,350
I see. I didn't realize.
Sorry for going overboard.

114
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:46,420
I'll quickly eat with my friends and leave.
Be nice until we go.

115
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,330
Da Huin.

116
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,960
If that's not what he means, then what?

117
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,830
Jeong Oh Je...

118
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:11,210
The signatures of the parents
who want the homeroom teacher of Class 2-3 to be changed.

119
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:16,150
They are of the opinion that someone who is more experienced in college testing would be better to lead the class.

120
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,330
They have come to a consensus.

121
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:21,090
Well, it's not 100%, but the majority of parents—

122
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:23,760
I don't think this is the majority.

123
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,470
Anyway, over half of parents—

124
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,600
Two, four, five—

125
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,600
Wait, wait. Teacher.
The number isn't what's important.

126
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,250
It may not be the majority,

127
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:38,560
but the fact that the parents
of high ranking students feel this way—

128
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,590
This was started by Hui Yeong's mother.

129
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:47,260
Because I opposed having the advanced English class?

130
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,850
Or because I didn't obey her?

131
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,270
Teacher Oh, that's why.

132
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,390
I know how you feel, but be more flexible

133
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:59,110
How can you let things come to this?

134
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,640
I don't know about that.

135
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,720
I won't change my stance.

136
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,300
It's a big problem...

137
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,800
Wow, it really makes me mad.

138
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,800
After coming back from a fun school trip.

139
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:26,000
Teacher Oh Han Gyeol

140
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,870
The call cannot be completed.

141
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:34,800
Reject?
She rejected my call?

142
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,590
What? Seriously!

143
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,370
Seriously!

144
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,580
Do you think I'll even blink an eye if you do this?

145
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,380
Then I'll convince the other moms...

146
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:48,010
Convince... I can't.

147
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:52,730
What is this? A relapse from the trauma
of feeling timid all over again? Seriously.

148
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,180
Deun
(First syllable of "being confident")

149
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,860
Mister.

150
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,330
I'm sad, too, so let's do it together.

151
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,360
Together!

152
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,660
That much?

153
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,510
I don't have that much money.

154
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:18,500
Don't cry, Mom.
I'll figure it out somehow.

155
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,610
Make sure to take your medicine okay?

156
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,290
My mom went on a business trip
so she's coming back tomorrow.

157
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,750
You won't run into her.

158
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,720
Still, the neighbors...

159
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,880
Hello.

160
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,870
Let's go.

161
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,640
I'll watch you go in.

162
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,320
Bye.

163
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,010
- By the way, tomorrow—
- Tomorrow..

164
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,510
Think about what you want to do tomorrow.

165
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:53,790
♬ I'm with you today ♬

166
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:58,410
♬ We're walking the roads we've walked together ♬

167
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:03,090
♬ With the things you like ♬

168
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:06,710
You thought I left, didn't you.

169
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,860
I'm really going to go now.

170
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,770
I'm leaving!

171
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,590
♬ I don’t know what I do ♬

172
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,330
I'm meeting her again tomorrow.

173
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:25,160
The day after tomorrow.
And the day after that.

174
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,610
I'll like you tomorrow too.

175
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:31,520
The day after tomorrow, and the day after that.
I can like her every day.

176
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:36,430
♬ Let's just think of the times we loved ♬

177
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,820
You're late.

178
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,190
Mom.

179
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,300
Why are you so shocked?
Did you commit a crime?

180
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,710
School ended a while ago.
Why are you coming in now?

181
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:47,780
I'm only being lenient since you came back
from the school trip today.

182
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,550
I thought you were supposed to come back tomorrow.

183
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,790
I was going to but I finished early.

184
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,390
Why?
Do you not like that I finished early?

185
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,390
No, I'm glad.

186
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,830
I'm going to go rest now.

187
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,110
Did you like it that much?

188
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:08,470
The air must have been so great that your face is all lit up.

189
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:13,120
You're lucky Yoo Soo Bin.
I wish I could go on a trip, too.

190
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,760
So lucky!

191
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,970
Atelier Cologne

192
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:26,520
♬ This night is passing by quickly ♬

193
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,490
♬ And I'm okay with that ♬

194
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:34,910
♬ Drawing your face in my mind ♬

195
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,990
Are you looking at perfume?

196
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:40,450
Yes.
I want to give it as a gift.

197
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,370
- To your girlfriend?
- Yes.

198
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:48,960
♬ Without even knowing ♬

199
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:57,250
♬ I want to draw your pretty face ♬

200
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:02,150
The one in your hand is neutral and popular with couples.

201
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,520
I'll give you a test sample.

202
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,270
Give it a try.

203
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:14,440
If you spray it like this you'll be able to smell the natural scent.

204
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:21,520
♬ Without even knowing ♬

205
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,980
♬ I would have never ♬

206
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:35,770
♬ I would have never ♬

207
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,850
That's what I'm saying.
I lost. I lost.

208
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,550
I lost out to your total devotion to Soo Bin.

209
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:49,390
But just one thing,
I wish the other moms wouldn't know about it.

210
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:53,880
They keep complaining that I'm only taking care of Soo Bin.

211
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,270
Of course, of course.

212
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:59,140
Pay me back, yeah.
You better pay me back!

213
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,400
What?
Okay, Okay.

214
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,140
But aren't you pushing yourself too much?

215
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,420
There's so many things I want to do.

216
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,130
Then let's tell each other things we want to do one by one.

217
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,760
What could there be?

218
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,630
What?

219
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,890
- Are you hurt somewhere?
- My stomach.

220
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,740
My stomach kind of hurts.

221
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:35,100
Again? Your stomach probably hurts
because you thought of studying.

222
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,840
Did you hear that you have to go
to Hui Yeong's house tomorrow afternoon?

223
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,560
Yeah, yeah.

224
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:47,410
Yoo Soo Bin, you know that I have no liver
or gall bladder here (have no pride left), right?

225
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:52,350
Because of that racoon wo— (sly person)
No, because I gave everything to Hui Yeong's mom.

226
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:55,550
Soo Bin, let's do well this time.

227
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,380
Okay?

228
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,730
Hello?

229
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,190
Soo Bin?

230
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,990
Joon Woo! Did you get back safely?

231
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,690
Yes, Mom.

232
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,190
How was the trip? Fun?

233
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:19,380
Yes, it was fun.

234
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,820
Something good happened to you didn't it?

235
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,050
It's written all over your face.

236
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:26,960
"I'm very very happy right now."

237
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,000
No it's not.

238
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,880
- I see it went well with her.
- Her?

239
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,040
I knew when you asked me about my first love last time.

240
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,970
Who is it?
Is she in your class?

241
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:41,150
Things went well on the school trip, didn't it?

242
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:44,290
- What happened? Tell me what happened!
- Whatever.

243
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:45,020
I don't know.

244
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,280
- Come on, please just once!
- Whatever.

245
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:48,890
I don't know.

246
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:52,050
No, you can't go in.
Tell me!

247
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,350
Let's talk inside.

248
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,230
I'm leaving! Work hard!

249
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,130
Teacher, I—

250
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,970
Am done...

251
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:24,610
You must be tired, Teacher.

252
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:28,670
Is that why you cried at that time?

253
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,900
Yes.

254
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,700
You should just go berserk!
Go against her!

255
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,050
But I tend to become

256
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,150
extremely timid at crucial moments.

257
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,620
Don't be like that.

258
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,790
I heard from Joon Woo
that you're the best teacher in the world.

259
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,760
Even if the moms act like that,
the kids will take your side.

260
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,720
Trust the kids, trust yourself,

261
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,330
and be confident.

262
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:58,900
Then do I look like an okay teacher do you?

263
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,560
Not only okay.

264
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,220
If I had met a teacher like you when I was in school,

265
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,600
I wouldn't have turned out like this.

266
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,830
Then can't you meet one now?

267
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,510
Huh?

268
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:17,060
Let's date.

269
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:20,890
Let's go out.

270
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:24,500
I mean, I...

271
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,790
How many times did we even meet?

272
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,670
Who cares about how many?

273
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:33,190
Since I saw you, I had feelings.

274
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,150
Was it not like that for you?

275
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:38,150
I think I'm right.

276
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:42,640
You said you're extremely timid,
but at times like this, you're—

277
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,980
Not at moments like this, as a man.

278
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:50,120
Then... let's go out,

279
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,100
from this moment on.

280
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,770
Okay?

281
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,230
Okay.

282
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,500
Really?

283
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,210
Really?
You're being serious? You're not lying?

284
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,660
We're dating now, right?

285
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,720
Let's go out.

286
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:30,840
When he told us to go straight home...

287
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:35,090
I have orientation tomorrow for the tutoring class.

288
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:39,580
Yeah?
Then we won't be able to see each other much.

289
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,220
Right...

290
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,030
Should we meet up early?

291
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,560
Will that be okay?

292
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,500
I like it, but...

293
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,620
About an hour earlier?
8:00?

294
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:54,180
Earlier than that is fine, too.

295
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,250
Oh, is it too tiring for you?

296
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,990
Then... 7:30?

297
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,470
Will that be okay?

298
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,000
Of course.

299
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,430
It should be fine.

300
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:12,080
Then not 7:30.

301
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,830
How about a little earlier?

302
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,530
Earlier?
By how much?

303
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,560
7...

304
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,190
24?

305
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,590
Okay.

306
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,330
Wow, that's a change.
You're going to the library this early?

307
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:12,290
- Yeah.
- I guess you're nervous about your first orientation.

308
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,600
Yeah. Are you working today, too?
It's Saturday.

309
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,580
I know. I'll get it done as soon as possible so
I can go to Hui Yeong's.

310
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,510
- You're coming, too?
- Of course!

311
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,520
This chance didn't come easy!

312
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,060
I'll get going.

313
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,330
Bye! Study hard.

314
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,270
Yes.

315
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,890
Sorry, Mom.

316
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,950
Oh, it's the same!

317
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:08,620
Yeah.

318
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,640
Oh, this is the same, too.

319
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:13,520
Then...

320
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,380
What should we do first?

321
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,100
Well...

322
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:26,100
There aren't any movies to watch,
and the amusement park isn't open yet.

323
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,750
Then...

324
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:34,430
let's count to three and say
what you want to do the most out of these.

325
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,300
Okay.

326
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,770
One, two, three.

327
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:39,700
- One!
- Just be.

328
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,490
What was number one?

329
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,180
Then, we can do it together!

330
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,150
You're right.

331
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,000
Let's go.

332
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,280
- Hello.
- Oh!

333
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,270
Yeon Woo, you're done working for me now.

334
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:06,580
I saw your schedule, and you had work today, too.

335
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,930
You have to go far, it seemed.

336
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:10,740
No, I can just take a cab.

337
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,780
Then here.

338
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:22,200
You paid me too much for the time I worked.

339
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,650
I don't want to accept that.

340
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:28,340
Just accept it.
You made me kimchi

341
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:31,290
and packed lunchboxes.
You worked more than what I paid. Just take it.

342
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:35,420
I don't want any freebies.
Just take it.

343
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,830
Unni, how can you only think about yourself?

344
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:44,190
I don't want freebies either.
Besides the fact that you hired me,

345
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:47,030
I just did things that I wanted to.

346
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:52,260
Since you never get to eat
and you don't have time to do housework...

347
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,840
I felt bad, so I helped out a little.

348
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:59,970
Unni, how could you just calculate
my affections so coldly with money?

349
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:02,250
You have so many things to feel bad about.

350
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,350
And why am I your unni?

351
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:07,360
It's Unni, of course.
Are you Oppa?

352
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,800
This is all we have to do? Just be?

353
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,790
It's boring, right?

354
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,830
No, I like it.

355
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,640
The background keeps changing, too.

356
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,710
How is the seat?

357
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:42,430
I like it. I can see everything.

358
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,230
I rode these buses a lot when I was younger.
I had to go see my mom.

359
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,530
But...

360
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,390
when I got to sit here on those lucky days,

361
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:58,100
I felt very happy.

362
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:03,300
Something like the bus was going just for me.

363
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,960
At that moment.

364
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,340
That's really true.

365
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:43,010
I wanted to introduce you to Jeong Woo first.

366
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:49,660
If he knew I met you, he would have been amazed.

367
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:02,130
Hi, I'm Yoo Soo Bin.

368
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,780
As you can see, Joon Woo is doing very well.

369
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:08,800
He's a class vice president.
Now he's totally sociable.

370
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,000
And has a pretty girlfriend, too.

371
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,220
So don't worry about him and be well.

372
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,830
I'll take good care of him.

373
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,460
Take good care?

374
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,820
I took care of you a lot since the beginning.

375
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:41,910
I helped you with performance assessment
and told you off for trying to run away.

376
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:45,690
You know.
My overflowing charity-work mind.

377
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:51,820
I see.
That was because of your charity-work-like mind.

378
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,720
I thought it was because you were interested in me.

379
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,320
Not at all.

380
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,680
No, you looked like you were interested in me.

381
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:06,340
What about you? You came back after making
excuses with the performance assessment.

382
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:09,660
That was because I wanted to be responsible for my part.

383
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:24,580
♬ Certain days and nights are recalled ♬

384
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,990
Jeong Woo.

385
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:29,390
Don't be sorry for me anymore.

386
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:32,450
♬ The feelings too like understanding everything ♬

387
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:36,620
I'm doing well.
I'm happy.

388
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:41,500
♬ I can spend my time laughing ♬

389
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:53,900
Your mother married her first love?

390
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,790
So that really can happen.

391
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,700
It's like a fairytale.

392
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:02,090
But it didn't work out, so it wasn't a happy ending.

393
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:06,320
She had me on top of that, so she suffered a lot.

394
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:14,590
I don't think so.
I think she was already happy.

395
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,960
Because you were born.

396
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,300
By the way,

397
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,310
I'm curious about something.

398
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,600
What about?

399
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,460
When did it begin?

400
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:40,720
At which moment did you start liking me?

401
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:48,090
Wow, you've just brazenly decided that I like you.

402
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,590
Maybe I'm wrong?

403
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,530
I feel that way.

404
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,080
When we were practicing our English presentation?

405
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,000
When I thought you were transferring again

406
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,220
but came back?

407
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,560
For me, it was that day.

408
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,520
I feel shy telling you all of a sudden.

409
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:31,890
When was it?

410
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:34,170
Which...

411
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,730
I think for me it was since that day, too.

412
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:59,120
Why?

413
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,320
You can't concentrate?

414
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,910
Not that.

415
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:09,220
Don't be too lax. I heard Jo Sang Hoon from Class 1
is staying and not transferring.

416
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:14,030
Oh, your dad isn't the type to let those kinds of things go.
I don't know what he's up to.

417
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,610
Eat it before studying.

418
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:18,310
Mom.

419
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,960
- Soo Bin.
- Yeah?

420
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,610
I think it would be best to take her out of the tutoring class.

421
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:27,600
Why?
She asked you to?

422
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,670
She feels guilty because she feels like
she's getting special treatment again?

423
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:35,120
Oh, that girl!
Why is she so inflexible when she's so young?

424
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,780
Her mother begged me for this.

425
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,520
It's not that.

426
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,420
I think it will be more comfortable with just the guys.

427
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,760
Son.

428
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:50,390
You don't like Soo Bin much anymore, I guess.

429
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:55,180
Then you'll concentrate 100% on your studies now, right?

430
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,300
Oh, good thinking, Son!

431
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:01,230
Because of Soo Bin, I thought you were more stable

432
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:04,270
so I didn't like it but I was watching it and seeing.

433
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:07,520
But I don't need to do that anymore, right?

434
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:11,190
What do you mean?

435
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:14,650
Why all of a sudden—
Hello?

436
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:17,680
That raccoon...

437
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,990
Raccoon?

438
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:21,050
What happened?

439
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,790
Turn the car around.

440
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,740
- Huh?
- Make a quick U-turn. Hurry.

441
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,560
Okay.

442
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,790
Madam!

443
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:46,220
Madam!

444
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,500
Soo Bin's mom?
What brings you here?

445
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:51,390
Madam why are you being like this?
Why are you taking Soo Bin out?

446
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:53,270
I thought about it over and over, and I think

447
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:56,870
Soo Bin's scores are a little lacking to be in the same class

448
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:59,660
She's not in the top tier of only one class, Math.

449
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,290
You said you would overlook everything else specially.

450
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:06,550
Soo Bin's mom, special requests and special privileges,

451
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:11,880
I don't like those types of things.
You know how transparent I am.

452
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,370
I have plans, so...

453
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:14,200
No wait, wait.

454
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,750
Why are you like this?

455
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,220
Hello.

456
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,180
Yes.

457
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:25,240
Madam.
There's another reason right Madam?

458
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,960
That habit of calling me Madam.

459
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,600
It's been annoying me all this time.

460
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,840
Well, I get that you want to make a good impression,
but as a fellow mom,

461
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,300
don't you think calling me Madam is a bit irritating?

462
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,540
Have some dignity, Soo Bin's Mom.

463
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:42,660
Why would you not when you're an intelligent person
from a prestigious school?

464
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,040
Excuse me.

465
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:49,620
Don't you think you should apologize?

466
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,850
You knocked her bag down.

467
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:56,880
You two...
Since when were you friends?

468
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,500
It's been a while.

469
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,320
So you came here together?

470
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,750
That's an amazing friendship.

471
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:06,960
No, I—

472
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,050
Anyway, I hope you apologize later.

473
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,360
Let's go, Soo Bin's Mom.

474
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,460
What is with those two?

475
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,440
It's a gift.

476
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,290
To commemorate us dating.

477
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:46,680
What is this?

478
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,210
It smells nice.

479
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:55,840
Choi Joon Woo, you know how to do stuff like this too?

480
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,130
Of course.

481
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:02,260
I didn't even know that I could do stuff like this.

482
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:09,490
Thanks for accepting my heart.

483
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:21,260
This is exactly how you looked.
The first time I met you at the entrance of the school.

484
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:30,140
You too. Just like this.

485
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,280
I apologize for uselessly butting in.

486
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:48,920
Thank you.

487
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:52,190
For what?
I didn't do anything.

488
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:55,420
You didn't do anything in particular, but I feel thankful.

489
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,910
Don't know why...

490
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:10,000
So you're saying now that

491
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,500
I spearheaded the petition?

492
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:21,160
Ma'am, if you did that because there's something
that you feel guilty about,

493
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,420
just tell me honestly.

494
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:26,630
Guilty?
A-About what?

495
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:29,800
I mean, are you saying that I did a grade manipu-...

496
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:34,150
-lation or something?

497
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:39,690
Teacher Oh,
you know this counts as a very serious defamation,

498
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:40,830
right?

499
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:43,190
About manipulating gra—

500
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:47,780
I have never said anything about manipulating grades, Ma'am.

501
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:53,570
I'm saying for example. "For example."

502
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:56,270
That question 15 matter last time, too.

503
00:36:56,270 --> 00:37:00,780
You would agree that there's something
that doesn't feel quite clean.

504
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:05,510
So please, even if for Hui Yeong's sake—

505
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:10,070
Teacher Oh, are you asking to go toe-to-toe with us?

506
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:13,350
So have you been digging around here and there?

507
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:16,530
I'm not saying to do anything.

508
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:20,740
I just want to right a wrong, if there is one.

509
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:27,880
So you think he figured out something?

510
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,270
I think so, but then not.

511
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:36,650
That Teacher Oh, unlike how he looks, he's a real trickster.

512
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:38,730
I just don't know.

513
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,890
What do I do, Honey?

514
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:44,110
What do you mean?
Just do what we always do.

515
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:48,640
Make sure Hui Yeong doesn't find out.
He's mentally weak as it is.

516
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:55,160
Suppress it.
The kids will be home.

517
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,270
Suddenly?

518
00:37:56,270 --> 00:38:00,380
I don't know.
Maybe something was unsatisfactory or something.

519
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:05,480
Sit down here.

520
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:10,260
Did you offend Hui Yeong or something?

521
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,810
Huh?

522
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:20,340
You should have been nice to him. Why ruin a perfect meal?
(ruin something that was perfectly executed)

523
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,270
Raccoon-like woman.

524
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:27,070
That's how she expresses the sense
of inferiority that she had about me.

525
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:32,410
Exactly why do I have to hear
something like that because of you?

526
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:36,480
Mom, you knew I wasn't good enough for that group.

527
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:43,000
I think bad things keep happening because
we're trying to fit into something that doesn't fit.

528
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,020
Just leave it to me.

529
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:50,550
I'm not as smart as you,

530
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:55,430
but still, I'm trying my best.

531
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,960
Sly talker.

532
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:03,120
Are you boxing?

533
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,060
Fighting.

534
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,180
Hello.

535
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,620
Welcome.

536
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,520
Hi Sim Bok.

537
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,880
Only today's class will be here.

538
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,350
The rest will be at the office suite.

539
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:17,820
Just know that.

540
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:20,620
Yes. Thank you.

541
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,650
You're here?

542
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:26,010
- What about Gi Tae?
- He said he can't come. I think he's sick.

543
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:27,590
Really?

544
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,930
You are...

545
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:33,790
Hello, Ahjumma.

546
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,900
Oh, Sang Hoon, welcome.

547
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,020
Hello, President.

548
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:40,690
Honey.

549
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:43,230
Wow, the house is really nice.

550
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:45,220
Is this real?

551
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,230
Honey, but still!

552
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:53,820
This is pushing it!

553
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:57,050
Do you agree with your mom?

554
00:39:57,050 --> 00:40:01,830
Do you know what it means to be the best?

555
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:04,760
Competing fiercely like a savage beast

556
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:10,690
and surviving without getting bit,
only one can end up at the top.

557
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:14,180
He's smart.
Compete against him.

558
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:18,400
Honey, then Hui Yeong will, like last time—

559
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,830
If he can't even win against this, he'll get bit and die.

560
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:23,900
Like Hyung?

561
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:29,810
What do you mean?
He's going great!

562
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:31,140
If you were only like him...

563
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:34,140
Don't worry, Dad.

564
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:38,870
I'll win. I will survive.

565
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,810
Hui Yeong, thanks.
Thanks to you, I get to come to a place like this.

566
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:53,740
Thank you.

567
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,430
Can I ask for a favor?

568
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:57,230
Of course. Anything.

569
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:01,220
Don't act in front of me.

570
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:05,650
Be yourself.
Greedy and cunning.

571
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,160
What do you mean?

572
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,080
I'm always like this.

573
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:15,290
I want to use the restroom. Where is it?

574
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:21,660
Hui Yeong. Don't mess with me.

575
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,870
You'll get hurt.

576
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:32,450
Oh, Gi Tae.
Are you really sick?

577
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:37,200
I'll upload today's lesson online.

578
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,160
Thanks.

579
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:48,980
I don't think so.

580
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,130
I'm sure she was already happy.

581
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:54,010
Because you were born.

582
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:31,460
Oh!

583
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:36,060
Did you wait very long?

584
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,690
No.
Let's go.

585
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:39,430
What about Beom Bi

586
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:42,820
I told it to stay home so we can walk together.

587
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,890
It must be sad.

588
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:47,670
A love triangle?

589
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:50,280
Let's go.

590
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:10,080
What? Keep at it!

591
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,240
It was a nice thing to see.

592
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,440
Chan Yeol!

593
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,340
Then I will... like this.

594
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,620
Hi.

595
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:25,020
Wow, her steel-like mental strength.

596
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,190
- Hi.
- Hi.

597
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:30,880
Yoo Soo Bin, I heard you were cut out
of Hui Yeong's tutoring class.

598
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:32,510
I didn't get cut out.

599
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:36,310
You did. I heard he said he didn't
want to do it with you anymore.

600
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:38,130
Lee Gi Tae's mom said so.

601
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:42,090
You undercover Hwang Ro Mi. You went into the moms'
chatroom with your mom's phone, didn't you?

602
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:46,510
As expected, I'm sure your level doesn't match his anymore

603
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:48,580
since this happened.

604
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:53,020
That little...
Hey, Hwang Ro Mi! Hey!

605
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:55,780
Mental st—

606
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:00,100
She's just her usual self.

607
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,080
Let's go. Come on!

608
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:06,230
Come! Seriously.

609
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:16,760
Why didn't you tell me you couldn't be
in the tutoring class anymore?

610
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,920
It's not important, that's why.

611
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:21,790
I'm happy I don't have to do it.

612
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:26,040
Choi Joon Woo, I can see

613
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:29,620
that you're worried it was because we're dating.

614
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,390
I can still see it.

615
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:44,790
I can still see.

616
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:54,670
Just get your books out already.

617
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:09,480
Hui Yeong.

618
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,400
Talk then come.

619
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,580
The class, Jo Sang Hoon came in, too,
and there were just too many people.

620
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:24,280
Jo Sang Hoon, too?

621
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,160
Wow, I'm glad I'm not doing it.

622
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,050
It would have been too hard even
if I did since the level doesn't match.

623
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:34,210
I asked for you to be removed.

624
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:38,300
I didn't have the confidence to keep seeing you in tutoring class.

625
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:41,610
But, it's still uncomfortable.

626
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,600
Yes, Ji Min.

627
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,660
Did you sleep well?

628
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:55,480
Did you dream about me?

629
00:45:56,930 --> 00:45:59,360
Really?
Oh, I was just joking.

630
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:02,490
Really? Wow, thank you.

631
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:04,680
For meeting me in your dream, too.

632
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:09,250
Then study well today, too.
I'll call when I get a chance.

633
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:12,310
Yes. Yes.

634
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:14,670
Teacher.

635
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:18,010
You have a girlfriend, right?

636
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:21,170
Yeah. You saw?

637
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:23,040
What do you think?

638
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:27,020
You look so great together.

639
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:31,360
She's pretty, and she seems like a nice person.

640
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:36,790
Right? I lived as a good person,
so a day like this has come.

641
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:39,630
Well... Oh!

642
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:44,080
Chan Yeol, can you do a tarot reading later of my love life? Okay?

643
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,780
Yes.

644
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:12,990
Da Huin.

645
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:27,180
Me too.

646
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,710
Everyone, if you need a handout, come get one.

647
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:49,130
That class, I'm thinking about not doing it.

648
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:51,450
Why?

649
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:58,230
To be honest, I can't afford it,
but I was doing it because of you.

650
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:00,080
It feels a bit, you know.

651
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,690
Hey, we're friends, so we're doing it together, obviously.

652
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:06,850
Still. I don't think this is right.

653
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,520
I'll just do what I can afford, Hui Yeong.

654
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:19,340
Then you don't want to see me anymore?

655
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:23,680
It's not like that. I'm more
comfortable doing it on my own steam.

656
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:27,340
Fine. Do what you're comfortable.

657
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:30,300
But there won't be sharing of exam materials from now on.

658
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:33,050
I'll close out your study group membership, too.

659
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:42,620
Hurry up and tell me.
I don't want to get a sunburn.

660
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:47,080
You didn't eat again, right?
You look gaunt.

661
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:51,400
I'm not accepting your apology.
I have too many pent up feelings.

662
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,760
I don't want to hear you say sorry from now on either.

663
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,900
I'll get going.

664
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,030
Da Huin, we—

665
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,910
Like before, can't we just be friends?

666
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:13,930
To be honest, with you, just...

667
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:18,390
I'd rather we be friends.

668
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:21,110
Not a girlfriend.

669
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:27,650
I tried,

670
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:34,790
but it's too hard

671
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:37,660
as a boyfriend.

672
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:45,130
You're so nice to me, but since
I can't do the same for you, I feel sorry,

673
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:48,190
and I don't know what I should be doing.

674
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:50,460
There's no other reason.

675
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:53,070
Like liking someone else or that I don't like you,
it's nothing like that.

676
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:57,380
Hey, stop talking.

677
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:02,090
Talking so much...

678
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:07,680
You barely smiled and said one word
when I said ten words to you.

679
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:11,960
Are you being generous?

680
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,420
Since you have to break up with me?

681
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:19,390
Making me pitiful...

682
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:22,420
Da Huin...

683
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:50,520
Today after school

684
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,330
I have two hours free.

685
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,700
Okay, it's okay for me, too.

686
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:02,640
Should we go get drinks?

687
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:05,660
Something sweet?

688
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,470
After school, at that place?

689
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,800
What changed for you?

690
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,270
After going out with me?

691
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:46,820
The world has just—

692
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:51,850
Nothing grandiose like the world has changed.

693
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:03,170
I keep looking at the mirror.

694
00:52:06,610 --> 00:52:08,380
Me too.

695
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:10,140
Why?

696
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:14,750
You're cute even without looking at the mirror.

697
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:16,520
I know.

698
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:20,370
Just kidding.

699
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:31,330
These days, when I look in the mirror,
I look so excited.

700
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:34,430
It wasn't like that before.

701
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:42,120
So whether it's the mirror or the glass,
I used to not look at it.

702
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:46,120
It's not like that now, so it amazes me.

703
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:50,770
You know, right?

704
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:53,040
What?

705
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:57,510
You're like... these days...

706
00:52:58,890 --> 00:53:00,210
pretty.

707
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:01,610
What did you say?

708
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:03,270
You've become...

709
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:06,020
What did you say?
I can't hear you.

710
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:08,430
You're becoming prettier.

711
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:13,900
I always was, wasn't I?

712
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:19,010
You always have been,

713
00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:25,170
but these days, you seem more...
day after day becoming prettier, and...

714
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:29,370
even more...
I want to see you.

715
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:35,510
Also, I keep wondering about you.

716
00:53:36,890 --> 00:53:38,660
About what?

717
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:41,970
It's nothing big.

718
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:49,010
How does Yoo Soo Bin sneeze?

719
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:52,820
Does she sleep curled up?

720
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:57,060
Does she sleep in a running position or with her arms up?

721
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,230
Also...

722
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:04,130
I thought about those things, too.

723
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:11,350
Can Choi Joon Woo really not sleep with the lights off?

724
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:15,700
These days you have your mom, so you probably do.

725
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:23,540
Also, does he know that his left eye
gets smaller when he smiles?

726
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:26,660
Me?
Not true.

727
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:28,570
It's true.

728
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:30,900
Smile properly again.

729
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:35,490
You're purposely making your right one smaller.

730
00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:36,330
- No, I'm not.
- On purpose.

731
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:37,080
I'm not. I'm not.

732
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:39,700
Hey, you smile like that?

733
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:43,690
Open it up properly. What is this?

734
00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:57,440
Also, when I'm with you, everything feels relaxed,

735
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,980
like all the worries of the world disappear.

736
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:05,440
It's nice.

737
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:09,160
On days like this, if you wash your hair
and put your head by the open window,

738
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:11,760
it feels refreshing.

739
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:17,290
The cold wind blows over the hair
like someone is blowing on it.

740
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:24,110
Like someone is stroking your hair?

741
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:27,480
Right.

742
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:32,550
But not in wintertime.

743
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,270
Your hair will freeze.

744
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:39,590
You know, it sticks up.

745
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:44,650
You become taller, but...

746
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:47,290
But that's not your height.

747
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:50,500
I know.

748
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:59,350
Now, you need to go to your part-time job.

749
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:01,290
I still have 30 minutes.

750
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:03,550
You want me to walk you there?

751
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:11,160
Then let me stop by the house first for a second.

752
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,090
Why suddenly?

753
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:42,780
It stopped, right?

754
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:46,820
Let's go.

755
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:55,250
I left my phone at the house.
My mom said she would call me later.

756
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:58,050
You're forgetful.
Go ahead.

757
00:56:58,050 --> 00:56:59,960
I'll be back.

758
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:06,460
Are you okay?

759
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:08,920
Yeah, it'll stop.

760
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:18,490
Come in and have some water.

761
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,040
No, it'll stop.

762
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:26,890
It's fine. Mom's at the office.
I just talked to her.

763
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:28,880
Come in and have some water.

764
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:51,240
Come in.
Have some water.

765
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,720
Just bring me some water.

766
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:57,680
No one's here. It's okay.

767
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:02,330
Okay.

768
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:09,710
Drink.

769
00:58:09,710 --> 00:58:11,580
Thanks.

770
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,060
What are you doing?

771
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:23,370
If you do that, it stops.

772
00:58:23,370 --> 00:58:25,710
I see. It's gone?

773
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,330
Keep drinking.
I'll bring the phone.

774
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,880
I think it's the housekeeper.

775
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:30,290
Joon Woo!

776
00:59:31,990 --> 00:59:34,060
Mom!

777
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,840
♬ For many of my days ♬

778
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:47,570
♬ I wish you would stay ♬

779
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:52,770
♬ Even if the day is not significant ♬

780
00:59:52,770 --> 00:59:57,450
♬ You, who soothed my feelings and ♬

781
00:59:57,450 --> 01:00:00,270
Moment at Eighteen
~ Preview ~

782
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:04,110
But mom, what happened?

783
01:00:04,110 --> 01:00:05,880
You feel a bit...?

784
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,650
If you're okay, then I am okay.

785
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:10,100
Something weird was posted.

786
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:11,930
President, the grade manipulation isn't true, right?

787
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:12,990
What do you think?

788
01:00:12,990 --> 01:00:16,590
I believe you.
Even if something unexpected happens,

789
01:00:16,590 --> 01:00:19,770
it won't be because you did something wrong.

790
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:22,180
I'm right, right?
You understand everything?

791
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:26,620
I'm not.
I just pretended to be mature.

792
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:31,140
I have to do that in order for you
and mom to feel comfortable.

793
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:33,390
Something bad happened with your dad, right?

794
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:36,120
What do you regret the most?

795
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,730
For not being able to admit that it was me.

796
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:39,540
Let's go there and tell them.

797
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:42,380
Hoping all your regrets disappear.

798
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:45,020
It's not your fault. You didn't know.

799
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:47,990
At that time,
you thought that was the best you could do.

800
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:49,220
♬ For many ♬

801
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:51,460
What are you doing?

802
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:55,030
♬ I wish you would stay ♬

803
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:59,130
♬ Even if the day is not significant ♬
