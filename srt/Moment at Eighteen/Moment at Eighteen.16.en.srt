1
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:13,610
Joon Woo.
Hui Yeong is leaving today.

2
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,000
He said he wanted to leave when no one's around.

3
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:26,390
Teacher, thank you for everything up to now.

4
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,840
And...

5
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,250
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:43,680
For daring to say to you what I did, acting rudely,

7
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:52,760
for my parents' disrespectful actions,
my egotistical actions.

8
00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:00,430
I apologize for all of that, and...

9
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,160
about things involving Joon Woo, too.

10
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:16,580
Hui Yeong, you held up well in this painful process.

11
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,690
There will be difficult times ahead but don't blame anyone.

12
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:31,020
And all you have to do is live with a firm
belief of your own volition.

13
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,320
Yes.

14
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:44,270
But I'm feeling a bit sad. Hui Yeong.

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,220
Be well, and don't lose contact.

16
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,070
I will do that.

17
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,950
Soo Bin.

18
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,340
You're going to be all right?

19
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,000
I will be.

20
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:49,140
Bye.

21
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:07,120
You said that me dropping out was running away.

22
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:11,660
So I thought a lot about it.

23
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,460
This is the only path I can see right now.

24
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:26,750
Studying hard and attending school
with kids who have been going to school with sincerity

25
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,780
makes me feel too guilty.

26
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:41,910
The things I did to you, I'll pay for them all

27
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,750
and live while repenting.

28
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,590
Joon Woo.

29
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,050
Thank you for forgiving me.

30
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,850
Bye.

The present separation will never last forever.

Min Jok Art College Design & Art Contest

57
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,380
Joon Woo!

58
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,230
Soo Bin.

59
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,950
Why did you come?
I can go alone.

60
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:41,390
I... wanted to come sooner, but...

61
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:46,350
I had to go to the academy first, so...

62
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,880
Okay. You're sweating.

63
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,050
No, I've been sweating.
On an important day like today...

64
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:59,950
You can't even run well.
What if you fell?

65
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:04,760
Today... today...

66
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,310
Today, I'll do well.
Don't worry.

67
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,130
It'll turn out well.

68
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:13,260
- Fighting!
- Yeah.

69
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:18,130
- Soo Bin, I should go in.
- Okay, good luck.

70
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,580
- Get back safe.
- Okay. Do well!

71
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,010
Thanks.

72
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,400

You can take a seat according to the order of your registration.

00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,490

Let's do well. Choi Joon Woo.

82
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,270
Soo Bin.

83
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,920
What's the matter?

84
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,350
I have to repeat the course.

85
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:51,910
- Again?
- What do you mean again?

86
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:57,870
- Well, this is...
- It's not only me that has to.

87
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:02,930
- Everyone does?
- Yeah. I worked hard. I wonder why.

88
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,910
- It's okay. Do you want to go eat something?
- Okay.

89
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:13,430
There's a rumor the food here is good.

90
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,720
Let's go out to eat.

91
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,400
Should we?
We should, right?

92
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:00,040
Shelter Psychiatric Convalescent Hospital

93
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:07,820
Hyung, have you been well?

94
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:15,120
Mom and Dad have been busy, so I came.
They're doing well.

95
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,760
And I dropped out of school.

96
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,910
I wanted time to think...

97
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:30,580
how I should live.

98
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:51,600
You know what?

99
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,930
Since we were little, you were my role model.

100
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:05,740
You were smart and you were good in school.

101
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:10,620
Good in sports and good-looking.

102
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,420
Mom and Dad liked you the best.

103
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,690
And they were the proudest of you.

104
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:27,280
They always told me to do just as much as you.

105
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:31,270
Just as much as you...

106
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,970
But I'm not going to make that effort anymore.

107
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:44,280
I'm just going to do as much as it suits me.

108
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,850
As much as I can do.

109
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:54,120
I'm going to find out for myself...

110
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,230
what I have to do.

111
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:04,030
Someone told me.

112
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:40,880
I wonder if Joon Woo's doing well.

113
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:51,020
- Soo Bin.
- Mom!
- Come.

114
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,720
It's been a long time since we've been on a date.

115
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,460
Sorry. I've been so busy.

116
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:01,020
It's okay. I think how you work is cool.

117
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:06,950
Soo Bin, I thought about it,

118
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:15,350
and from now on, I'll make an effort to trust you more.

119
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:22,330
But, right now, I can't cheer your relationship on.

120
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:29,830
- I know.
- But sorry for reacting so emotionally to it before.

121
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:37,530
Mom.
Can I make a request?

122
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,790
What is it?

123
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:46,740
I would like you to... not mind Dad and

124
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:50,670
just live well courageously.

125
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:54,600
Until now, you've made your best effort.

126
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,640
So don't think about what others think.

127
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:03,560
If it's because of me, I'm really fine.

128
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,010
As you've done until now,

129
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:12,980
I'd like you to live resolutely, cooly.

130
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:17,810
Not as Yoo Soo Bin's mom or Yoo Joong Soo's wife

131
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:23,750
but as a cool career woman, Yoon Song Hee,
just as you are.

132
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,110
Huh?

133
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:34,910
Soo Bin, would we be able to order more
after finishing all this?

134
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:38,650
More than this?

135
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:57,330
- Yeah, Mom.
- Oh, Joon Woo, did you do well?

136
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:01,600
I tried my best, but I'm not sure.
Other kids are good.

137
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,910
But I'm sure you did the best.
Good job, my son.

138
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:10,750
But where are you?
Why is there an echo?

139
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:16,840
Oh, I came to a big market.
I ran out of ingredients.

140
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,880
I see. Mom,

141
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,370
- should I come by today?
- Huh?

142
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,480
Why are you so shocked?

143
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:32,070
You have to get home and get some rest.
Why would you come here?

144
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:35,540
I got it. Eat well.

145
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:40,350
Okay. You, too. Bye.

146
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,590
- But there's Aunt Hye Yeong.
- She's not feeling well these days.

147
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:48,330
You don't look well either.
Are you sick?

148
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:53,240
No, I'm totally well.

149
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,550
Soo Bin.

150
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:35,270
I'm with my mom.
Should we text?

151
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,930
Soo Bin, I did well.

152
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:42,780
You worked hard.
Are you going home?

153
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:46,450
No. To my mom.
To surprise her.

154
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,850
Oh, she'll be happy.
Get back safe.

155
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:53,690
I had a date with my mom.

156
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:11,840
Yeah, Mom.
Did you get home okay?

157
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,590
Yeah.
I just closed up, and now I'm cleaning up.

158
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:22,270
How is business?
It's going well?

159
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:25,800
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

160
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,260
Okay.

161
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,630
Aunt Hye Yeong

162
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:54,490
The phone has been turned off,
so the call cannot be connected.

163
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:09,670
Aunt, it's me, Joon Woo.

164
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,970
Have you been well?
By chance,

165
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:23,280
did something happen to Mom's eatery?

166
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,980
Tell me.

167
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,970
Yes.

168
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,690
Joon Woo, are you sleeping?
Did you get back okay?

169
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:17,470
Yeah, I did.

170
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:20,360
Can I call you?

171
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:51,460
Joon Woo,
your mom was happy you surprised her, right?

172
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,660
Yeah.

173
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:03,140
But it feels like you're worried about something.

174
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,680
I'm not.

175
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:11,650
No, I could tell through your texts.

176
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:18,930
No. Maybe it's because I was a little nervous today.

177
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:24,010
I see.
You must be tired today.

178
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:27,680
Yeah. Today, I am a little.

179
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:33,280
Then I'll sing you a lullaby so you can get good sleep.

180
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:36,600
Yeah.

181
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,170
Oh, Joon Woo's mom!
Hurry up and get in!

182
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,640
- Sorry for being late!
- Why are you late?

183
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,070
Sorry.

184
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:35,830
- Don't be late tomorrow.
- Okay. Thank you.

185
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:41,170
Oh, I'm so sleepy.

186
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:33,660
- Yeah, Joon Woo.
- Mom, what are you doing?

187
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:38,050
What do you mean?
I have a lot of customers right now. I'm busy.

188
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,750
You're not.

189
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:28,190
Mom.
Tell me the truth.

190
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:32,680
What situation you're in, how bad it is.

191
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,400
Don't worry. I'll figure it out myself.

192
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,140
How is this figuring out yourself?

193
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:46,950
Mom. I'm not a kid anymore.
You have to discuss with me if something's going on.

194
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:50,490
We're the only family we've got.

195
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,650
I'm your guardian, too.

196
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:56,700
Why do you keep trying to shoulder
the burden by yourself?

197
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:04,100
Not knowing the situation until now,
it already makes me feel guilty and taken aback.

198
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,620
Joon Woo, don't be like that.

199
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:16,860
I only hid things from you out of necessity.
You did nothing wrong.

200
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,670
Mom.

201
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:26,390
Tell me everything. I want to know.

202
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:37,580
To be honest, Aunt Hye Yeong took the remodeling money,

203
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:40,200
but I can't get in touch.

204
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:46,180
It's a fairly large amount that I overextended myself to give.

205
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:53,510
Right now, rather than making money
while sustaining the eatery,

206
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:57,390
working part-time is better.
That's why I did it.

207
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:02,740
I'll take care of it.
Don't worry, Joon Woo.

208
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:05,470
I'm going to open up the shop again,

209
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:12,800
so you just concentrate on your entrance exams. Okay?

210
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,740
Mom...

211
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,650
Sorry.

212
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,880
Monthly spending...

213
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:50,220
Electricity, food cost...

214
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:54,400
transportation and academy tuition, too.

215
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,230
Total is...

216
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,900
- Joon Woo, what are you doing?
- I'm at the academy.

217
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:32,300
- You're doing well, right?
- Yeah, I'm doing well.

218
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,470
Good bye.

219
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:17,220
Should we run away quick?

220
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:23,820
I was busy yesterday, so I couldn't call.

221
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:32,710
Joon Woo, do you remember getting rained on here?

222
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,490
Why did you do that then?

223
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:43,210
Did you think you could block it?

224
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:45,830
I don't know.

225
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:53,550
That time, it was a feeling I had for the very first time.

226
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:56,100
What kind?

227
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:03,170
By getting completely soaked in the rain with you,

228
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:07,820
it felt like all my upset feelings were getting washed away.

229
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:14,780
Joon Woo, what are you doing over the summer break?

230
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:19,570
Not sure.

231
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:26,260
Finally, the summer vacation

232
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:30,100
- is back!
- It's back!

233
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:35,530
Wow, you guys were nowhere near
excited when I suggested the school trip.

234
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:37,860
- You're that happy now that you don't have to see me?
- Yes!

235
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:41,540
- Yoo Pil Sang.
- Not true. I'm sad.

236
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:44,100
How will I spend the summer without you?

237
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:48,260
Hey, Pil Sang, stop putting it on a show and check
for your homework for each subject online .

238
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:52,300
Everyone, have a healthy and full summer break.

239
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,810
And don't call me too often because you miss me!

240
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:59,460
- Teach, can I follow your Insta?
Follow me back, too!

241
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,540
I was already following you.

242
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:05,330
Oh.

243
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:10,650
Oh Han Gyeol,
you did well at being a homeroom teacher for the first time.

244
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:13,660
You did well.

245
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,800
Now then that's it.
Have a good break. Good bye!

246
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,030
Good bye!

247
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,920
Why is he being like that?
He's so nerdy.

248
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,910
Guys, how about going out to celebrate our break?

249
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,500
When are you going to keep your promise. Please?

250
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,020
I have to ask my mom.

251
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:45,180
- Come along if you want.
- Oh, then I should. I should.

252
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:48,100
Jeong Oh Je, Choi Joon Woo, you guys come, too!

253
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,870
Pack up your bags.

254
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:58,700
You're so excited.

255
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:03,550
Teach!

256
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:10,090
Excuse me, Ji Min, we're at school.
Please calm down. Be calm.

257
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:16,040
- I...
- No, it-it's okay if it's a no this time.

258
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:21,000
Today, should we go shopping?
Or to eat some meat?

259
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:25,810
I got accepted, Teach!
I got accepted!

260
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:29,320
Really? Rea—

261
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:35,140
Ji Min, first, let's leave here.

262
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:38,990
Wow, Gi Tae, you're working hard
on your in-school volunteer work!

263
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:41,460
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

264
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:45,100
- Throw away your own trash.
- Just what I have now.

265
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:48,340
Anyway, did you see Hui Yeong leave?

266
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:54,760
I didn't.
He'll probably call when he's sorted out his feelings.

267
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:58,890
Ah, pick up the trash properly!

268
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:01,870
Sung Hoon, leave.

269
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,980
Work hard.

270
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:18,330
Well done!

271
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:20,150
Yoo Pil Sang, you're not bad at bowling.

272
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:23,760
Of course, I'm good at everything aside from studying.
I'm good to you, too.

273
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,290
Never mind. Okay, Yoo Pil Sang,
I'll watch the movie with you this Saturday.

274
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:28,560
Oh, really?

275
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:33,600
But, with you, you, and you, you, all together.
Otherwise, I won't.

276
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,570
Guys, please help me.
I'll-I'll pay for the movie.

277
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:41,000
Hey!
You think we don't have the money, Yoo Pil Sang?!

278
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,550
Thanks!

279
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:45,180
Hey, let's go!

280
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,890
Let's do one more round before we go.

281
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:04,740
Wow, it feels like a dream.
Ji Min got accepted.

282
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:11,280
She said she's going to the bathroom.
What's taking so long?

283
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:17,230
What is this, Ji Min?

284
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:20,260
Teach, thanks for waiting for me.

285
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:25,820
And thanks for always being my strength.

286
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:29,430
Today, I'm formally proposing to you.

287
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:32,550
Let's date, Teach.

288
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:45,930
Joon Woo, are you worried about something?

289
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,680
- Oh Je.
- Yeah.

290
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:54,290
To be honest, I'm thinking about whether
I should go down to be with my mom or not.

291
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:57,250
Did something happen to her?

292
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:02,080
I think I should be with her.

293
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:07,200
Honestly...
she's going through a rough time.

294
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:10,690
But she only has me,

295
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:16,180
so I'm going to think about ways to lessen her burden.

296
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:22,220
- Still...
- When I saw her,

297
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:25,210
I had a sudden thought.

298
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:32,170
All this time,
I thought I was lonely because I was alone.

299
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:41,500
But honestly, isn't my mom who's the loneliest right now?

300
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:51,860
I now have Soo Bin and you, too.

301
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:55,120
And I have Teach Han Gyeol.

302
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,520
You're worried about Soo Bin?

303
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,200
Mom, I'm going to the academy.

304
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,840
- Let's work hard since it's the break.
- I got it.

305
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:33,460
Yes?

306
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:39,290
Okay.

307
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:51,740
Hello, thank you making the time.

308
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:56,700
What is it?

309
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,880
I heard your grades went up a lot.

310
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,210
I've also settled on a career path.

311
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:09,450
I'm going to go to an art college.
I'm attending an art academy, too.

312
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:14,160
- Art? I see. It must be hard.
- I'm fine.

313
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,710
What is it you wanted to say?

314
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:21,880
If you're asking me if you can date Soo Bin then

315
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,980
it's a little hard to answer. Please understand.

316
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,700
It's not about that.

317
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:34,490
But... I do have a request, so I called.

318
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:36,940
What kind of request?

319
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:43,520
With Soo Bin...
I want to see her for just one day.

320
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,910
You should have seen her without telling me.

321
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:51,000
So that she can feel at ease,

322
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,690
please tell her directly that you'll allow it.

323
00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:01,630
I... think I'm going to go down and...

324
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:05,930
be with my mom.

325
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:13,210
So I think we have to be apart for a bit.

326
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:18,840
Why suddenly? What happened?

327
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:23,590
Something came up... but

328
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,750
I want to tell Soo Bin myself.

329
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:36,490
So until then, please keep it a secret.
I ask you.

330
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:44,420
Okay. Yeah, I got it.

331
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:47,050
Thank you.

332
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:50,740
Joon Woo.

333
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:57,990
Thank you for comforting my Soo Bin before.

334
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:02,780
Also, I was too emotional about how I dealt with it.

335
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,310
I'm sorry about that.

336
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:09,570
It's okay.

337
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:17,620
- I'll leave first then.
- Okay.

338
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,060
- Hello?
- Where are you?

339
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:40,080
I'm at the academy.
Are you on your way home?

340
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:45,820
- Yeah.
- What's wrong?

341
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:50,540
Just...
I feel like we haven't been able to see each other much.

342
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:55,630
And since we're on vacation, we don't go to school.

343
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,900
Hurry up and go home.

344
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:02,480
Joon Woo, it's tiring, right?

345
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,990
Still, until the day we can get permission
from my mom and date comfortably,

346
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:09,320
let's bear with it a little longer.

347
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:14,360
To be honest, it's okay for me anyway.

348
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,090
Should we meet up now?

349
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:23,680
No. Until that day.
Hurry up and go home.

350
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,800
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

351
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,890
- I'm home.
- You worked hard?

352
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:43,540
- Were you out?
- Huh? Nearby.

353
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:48,200
Hey. You...

354
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:53,230
Since it's your break, meet up if you want.

355
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:56,270
Who?

356
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,820
Choi Joon Woo.

357
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,720
Why suddenly?

358
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:05,960
Well, you said to trust you.

359
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,380
And your grades went up,
and you said he's working hard, too.

360
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:13,910
Not to date but just see each
other for a day and get some air.

361
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:20,920
Thank you, Mom. It's nice to be able to comfortably
go out even for a day with your permission.

362
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,510
You're not overly happy or anything?

363
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:26,590
I'm happy. Thank you.

364
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:32,540
- Joon Woo, the thing you asked me for earlier.
- Thank you.

365
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:36,410
- It's someone who does private classes near there, so give them a call.
- Yes.

366
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:40,030
It would be great if you got a prize this time.

367
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:44,780
I don't think I will. Everyone was so good.

368
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:49,410
Joon Woo. Choi Joon Woo.

369
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:54,380
Right now,
I'll make a proposal you could never refuse.

370
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:59,110
Joon Woo, do you want to go on a date with me today?
All day?

371
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:02,980
- Mom gave me permission.
- Okay.

372
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:06,720
Oh, you're at the academy right now, right?
Concentrate. Concentrate.

373
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,170
I'll call you later.

374
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:15,260
Okay.
Thanks. I'll call you.

375
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,990
You're good.
As expected.

376
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,390
He's quitting.

377
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:02,950
Joon Woo!

378
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:09,030
Joon Woo,
I hear you're very talented.

379
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:13,840
See?
I have a good eye for people.

380
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:17,070
But why?

381
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:20,560
I heard you're quitting the academy.

382
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:27,360
Yes.

383
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:34,780
I was already thinking that I should tell you first.

384
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:40,820
I... think I have to be with my mom.

385
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:44,830
What do you mean?

386
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,970
Are you saying you're going to transfer?

387
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:55,220
Something difficult happened to my mom,

388
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,760
so I think I have to help her
as much as possible while being with her.

389
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:09,650
You know, Joon Woo, don't take this the wrong way.

390
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:12,120
Do you want me to help you a bit?

391
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:21,790
Teach...

392
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:28,390
thank you for caring to that extent.

393
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:40,200
But... you've finally adjusted,

394
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:44,730
and you've picked your career path
and are going to a good academy.

395
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:48,050
I think everything's fallen into place.

396
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:52,430
That's why I'm leaving.

397
00:43:55,120 --> 00:44:00,110
Now, no matter where I am, I have the confidence.

398
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,790
Hey, doing this makes you a runner!

399
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:11,000
Go and run away! It doesn't make you cool at all!

400
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:17,790
Choi Joon Woo!
You're a runner!

401
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,910
Okay, Joon Woo.

402
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,620
Go.

403
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:40,220
Go and take care of your mom.

404
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,430
I think you can do that now.

405
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:52,850
Without you here, I'll feel a little empty,

406
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,540
but still, I think you can do that now.

407
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:56,290
Yoo Soo Bin, you look pretty.

408
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:00,090
I look okay?

409
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,330
You look really pretty.

410
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,750
I'll be back.

411
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:15,550
Yoo Soo Bin. Also...

412
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:23,030
I thought about what you said. A lot.

413
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:32,560
Thank you so much, my daughter...

414
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:37,100
For giving me courage.

415
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:42,540
Soo Bin, I'll try and do that.

416
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,060
Okay?

417
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:55,040
I love you, Mom.

418
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,340
I love you so much.

419
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:59,810
I was sorry.

420
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:11,110
- Hi.
- Hi.

421
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:27,720
One, two, three.

422
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:30,900
One more time?
One, two, three.

423
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:07,430
Yoo Pil Sang.

424
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,300
- You want to try to date?
- What?

425
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:16,510
I'm only saying it one more time.

426
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:18,850
Let's date.

427
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,180
Sit down!

428
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:29,350
Sit down!

429
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:31,440
What are you doing?

430
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:39,950
It's nice.

431
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,920
Soo Bin.

432
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,550
Yeah?

433
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:07,080
I have something to tell you.

434
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,880
I know.

435
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:15,860
I kept getting a strange feeling,

436
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:19,220
so I called your mom.

437
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:25,540
After you went to see your mom,
something kept bothering me.

438
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:31,920
That you...
keep insisting on going down there,

439
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,150
even though she tried to stop you.

440
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,750
I'm sorry for telling you so late.

441
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:46,980
Guess what I told her.

442
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:57,550
Hello, this is Yoo Soo Bin.

443
00:50:57,550 --> 00:51:00,610
Yes, I have been well.

444
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:06,890
Perhaps, is there something going on with Joon Woo?

445
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:12,340
Joon Woo doesn't seem that well so
I called because I was worried.

446
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:16,910
It's okay, please tell me.

447
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:19,580
No matter how I stop him,

448
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:23,840
Joon Woo, perhaps it really bothers him,

449
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:26,520
so he keeps saying he wants to come down
and live with me.

450
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:30,250
That's why I just agreed with him.

451
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:32,700
You must be upset.

452
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:35,680
Right?
What should we do?

453
00:51:36,370 --> 00:51:39,720
I'm really fine though.

454
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:44,710
I'm sure Joon Woo also thought about it a lot.

455
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:51,000
No matter where Joon Woo is,
it is important that he feels at peace.

456
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,990
If he studies hard and continues to work hard on arts

457
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:57,480
then it will be fine.

458
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:02,130
I can just keep in touch with him.

459
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:04,460
So don't worry.

460
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:14,860
You went through a lot.

461
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,770
But, Joon Woo...

462
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:26,480
even though I told her that...

463
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:32,010
I... still...

464
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:48,220
Soo Bin, the truth is that you are the one
I am worried most about.

465
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:01,980
But just because I am going to go to my mom,

466
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:06,350
it doesn't mean it's over for us.

467
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:16,900
Each of us, wherever we are, let's be patient.

468
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:30,080
From now on,
we should not put on a sad or depressed face.

469
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,870
Promise?

470
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:38,890
Promise.

471
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:46,400
You're so nice.
Our Soo Bin.

472
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,360
My Joon Woo is so nice.

473
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,940
Congratulations. At the Min Jok Arts College's art contest, Choi Joon Woo received the silver award. Please check the website for the date and place of the ceremony and show.

474
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:12,560
Joon Woo, you won silver.

475
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:15,000
You are a silver awardee?

476
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,820
Hey, congrats!

477
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:21,410
This is so great!

478
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:26,900
Soo Bin.

479
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:29,000
Congrats.

480
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,510
Congrats, Joon Woo.

481
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:36,860
Thank you Soo Bin.

482
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:39,000
Thank you.

483
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:43,660
We're here.

484
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:46,890
Should we go for another round?

485
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:49,800
It's our seventh round.

486
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,590
You should go home now.

487
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,230
Take care.

488
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:10,070
Soo Bin.

489
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,820
I have a favor.

490
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:23,350
What?

491
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,770
When I leave...

492
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:32,410
I would like for you not to come.

493
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:38,390
Why?

494
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:45,080
I don't want to show you me leaving.

495
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,420
I will come to see you again.

496
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:12,420
After becoming way more cool.

497
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:44,850
♬ Certain days and nights are recalled ♬

498
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:47,190
My mom will be there when you arrive.

499
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:48,180
I leave it in your care.
♬ Certain days and nights are recalled ♬

500
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:53,180
I leave it in your care.
♬ Certain days and nights are recalled ♬

501
00:56:55,130 --> 00:57:04,740
♬ Now the feelings too, like understanding everything ♬

502
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:08,460
♬ I can spend my time laughing ♬

503
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:13,650
Joon Woo is leaving today, right?

504
00:57:13,650 --> 00:57:15,220
Yeah.

505
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:18,730
Go and say goodbye or something.

506
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:21,380
I have to do this.
The academy's closed today.

507
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:24,780
♬ I always am happy ♬

508
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:26,460
Okay.

509
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:34,700
♬ The time which is recalled like a picture ♬

510
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:38,620
♬ will be stored away ♬

511
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:45,600
♬  so that they will not fade away ♬

512
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:54,640
♬ Still remaining in the fading memory ♬

513
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:55,440
♬ Still remaining in the fading memory ♬

514
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,030
It's like a different world.

515
00:57:57,030 --> 00:58:00,790
- It's like a different world.
- It is a different world, the world I live in.

516
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:07,210
Happy Birthday to you!
Happy Birthday to you!

517
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:10,320
- Blow.
- I hope you succeed!

♬ you are always there with me ♬

547
01:02:59,890 --> 01:03:04,340
♬ And I was always scared to face the truth ♬

548
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:06,550
♬ Now I’m still ♬

549
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:08,950
♬ Waiting right here for you ♬

550
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:11,600
♬ to hold you in my arms again ♬

551

♬ Just like the days, ♬

552

♬ we were young ♬

553
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:23,390
We may be in front of a farewell

554
01:03:23,390 --> 01:03:26,140
but this farewell will not be forever,

555
01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:30,860
because all the moments we have shared are still radiant,

556
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:35,320
and the brilliant moments
of being eighteen are beautiful enough.

557
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:38,580
♬ Everything fades away ♬

♬ Are not going anywhere ♬

562
01:03:55,270 --> 01:03:58,390
The child with no name, Choi Joon Woo

563
01:03:58,390 --> 01:03:59,820
The Moment I want to run away

564
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:01,290
On a sad day it always rains

565
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:02,580
Happiness and sadness is just an instant

566
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:04,010
Once that long and sad day and night passes by

567
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:05,660
The timing of action and reaction

568
01:04:05,660 --> 01:04:07,060
Romeo and Juliet

569
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:08,840
The moment of first love

570
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:09,830
I'm sorry...

571
01:04:09,830 --> 01:04:11,560
The night that will never come back

572
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,090
The feelings that I knew through you

573
01:04:13,090 --> 01:04:14,430
Eighteen who is more adult-like than adults.

574
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:15,730
I will still like you.

575
01:04:15,730 --> 01:04:17,520
Happy Birthday to You

576
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,020
A way to embrace your wound

577
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:20,690
Hoping that this goodbye isn't forever

578
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:24,160
Moment at Eighteen

584

♬ Never quite understood it ♬

585
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:51,780
