1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,110
Choi Joon Woo.
You little punk.

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,190
I thought you were the Vice-principal!

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,770
The back door was hard to open.

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,990
Didn't he transfer to another school?

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,310
You little punk.

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,090
You were going to be like this and you...

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,900
Why did you pretend you were leaving?
Come here. I'm glad you're back.

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,880
I'm glad you're back.

9
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,300
This punk... Come over here.

10
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,430
Okay everyone, let's give a big hand to Choi Joon Woo,
who has returned!

11
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,940
Welcome back, Joon Woo.

12
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,680
You said you were leaving.
Was it a lie?

13
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,580
Since it's a rotten move to run away.

14
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:50,300
Joon Woo, you can go sit in that empty seat.

15
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,010
- Here you go, Hui Yeong.
- Thank you.

16
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,850
Episode 3:
It always rains on a sad day

17
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,530
Choi Joon Woo

18
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,050
Mom, I really don't want to go.

19
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:39,550
Then you should've gotten top grades in the first place.

20
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:43,060
Consider yourself lucky to be taking Mr. Son's level test.

21
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:47,670
It's because of your kissing up that day.
You even bought Hui Yeong's mom flowers.

22
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,200
What's wrong with me kissing up?
I could do even worse than that,

23
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,300
as long as my daughter can go to Seoul University.

24
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,510
You better pass the level test, seriously.

25
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,630
You can do it.

26
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,780
You can do it.
You're my daughter, right?

27
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,360
"I'll make it to Seoul University."
Say it.

28
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,990
Yoo Soo Bin, you can do it!
Yoo Soo Bin!

29
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,710
Was it that bad?

30
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,920
Running away.

31
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,830
- Is it funny?
- Then is it not?

32
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,600
When you're staying at a place that doesn't suit you at all?

33
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,730
I'm glad you found it funny.

34
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:20,180
Everyone said I was not funny.
I guess I've improved.

35
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,560
Ma Hui Yeong, don't mess with me.

36
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,000
What?

37
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:30,860
As long as you leave me alone, I won't do anything.
Because I can't be bothered.

38
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,580
"Don't mess with me"?

39
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,960
You punk.

40
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,830
What are you guys doing?

41
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,690
Soo Bin.

42
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,780
- What about the literature—
- Choi Joon Woo. You did good research for the references

43
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,500
for the performance assessment.

44
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,290
We did well, thanks to you.

45
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,270
You just submitted the literature assignment?
I was going to proofread it for you, though.

46
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,650
I even found some papers for reference.

47
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,660
Oh, really? You should've told me.
That's too bad.

48
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,250
Thanks.

49
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,390
Tell me when you submit it next time.
I'll proofread it for you.

50
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,610
- Let's go.
- You can go first. I need to go to Class 5.

51
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,440
Why are you so surprised?

52
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,050
By the way, you did a good job on that as well,
not running away.

53
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:51,060
Choi Joon Woo

54
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,980
Very good.

55
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,960
- Did you look into it?
- Yep.

56
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,520
It seems that Choi Joon Woo's transfer was conditional,
when he came here,

57
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,480
to leave if he got into another incident.

58
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,360
Really?

59
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,270
Then he'll be done if we get him into one more incident.
Choi Joon Woo.

60
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,690
- How?
- You have to come up with that.

61
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,030
As quickly as possible.

62
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,850
Hui Yeong.

63
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:24,460
Why are you trying to chase him out?
I don't think there would be any issues even if we let him be.

64
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,060
Because he's bothersome.
Repeatedly.

65
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,900
You can't lie just because it feels awkward.

66
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,040
Aren't you the trash?

67
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,090
He's irritating.

68
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:59,170
The call cannot be connected, so after the beep..

69
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,130
Sin Jeong Woo, why aren't you answering?

70
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:07,540
Is something going on?
Are you still with those people—

71
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,600
Hey, hey, wait.

72
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,610
Hey, it's not broken.
We saved money.

73
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,490
- Thank you.
- Okay.

74
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,600
- Joon Woo.
- Yes?

75
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,620
Is there... anything going on?

76
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:27,040
Like any issues, et cetera?

77
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,300
- No.
- Okay. Good.

78
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,030
You know, that is...

79
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,650
I know you haven't opened up.

80
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:40,270
But still, if any problems come up,

81
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,950
don't try to resolve it by yourself,

82
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,090
and tell me everything, okay?

83
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:51,800
No matter what,
I have a more varied life experience than you.

84
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,170
Yes.

85
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:56,660
"Yes." That conventional answer.

86
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,130
- The bell went off.
- I know, punk.

87
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,890
Oh, how could I help?

88
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,760
I can't even help myself.

89
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,240
Starting now, triple points for the first responses in 10 minutes.

90
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,630
I don't have money.
Stop it.

91
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:24,930
Like in Siberia, it gets affected in wintertime.

92
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,760
- And during the summer...
- I did it.

93
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,910
I stole that money.

94
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,560
Is that right?

95
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,880
- Yes.
- See? I told you. My kid didn't do it.

96
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,140
As you said,

97
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,100
I'll transfer.

98
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,860
Joon Woo.

99
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:55,960
Joon Woo, why would you?
Why?

100
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,790
You didn't do it.

101
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,390
I'm sorry, Mom.

102
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,020
- Understand, Eun Mi?
- Yes.

103
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:09,070
So that's how that is caused.

104
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:14,280
If you look at the bottom of page 68,
you can see a list of air masses that affect our country.

105
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,790
The Siberian air mass affects us in wintertime.

106
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,960
The North Pacific air mass affects us in midsummer.

107
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,340
So when the North Pacific air mass meets the Okhotsk High,
they form "The Rainy Season Front" (A non-moving boundary between two differing air masses.)

108
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,540
Hey, watch out to get enough quality sleep.

109
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,210
Hey, what are you doing?

110
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,290
- Hey, hey!
- Get out.

111
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:36,500
Wow, what a mess.

112
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,740
Now, now. Come on, Kids.
Let's start class.

113
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,980
Pil Sang, Chan Yeol, let go of that hair.

114
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,050
Yeah, Gyeon Ha, try and stop them.

115
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,780
Da Huin, you have to go to school.

116
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,570
You're sleepy because you keep starving yourself.
Kwon Da Huin.

117
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,170
Soo Bin, wake her up.

118
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,820
Come on, kids.
Let's start the class, please.

119
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,360
Hey.

120
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,860
Pil Sang, Teacher is here.

121
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,760
Sorry, Teacher.
I was distracted with my reading.

122
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,860
Yeah, fine.

123
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,900
Fine.

124
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,500
Now.

125
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,450
Gi Tae, can you switch seats with Joon Woo?

126
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:32,250
What? Wh-Why?

127
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,170
Until the next semester.

128
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,050
But still, we have memories and promises together.

129
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:40,660
- No, I'm sure not.
- Hui Yeong told us to sit like this.

130
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,930
Gi Tae is indeed Ma Hui Yeong's lackey.

131
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,010
Is that what he told you to do?

132
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,820
- Yes.
- I see.

133
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,560
Teach, I'll arrange it well next time we switch seats.

134
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,350
I see.

135
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,690
Please take good care as the head of the class
so everyone gets mixed in together well.

136
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,680
- Yes.
- Yes.

137
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:17,360
Were we up to page 40?
Now, 40...

138
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,820
But,

139
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:26,470
let's change it till then.
I think that would be better.

140
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,440
Come on, let's do that, Gi Tae.

141
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,090
I'm the teacher.
Please respect.

142
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,970
I feel sorry for him.

143
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,800
Totally cramps his style.

144
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,910
Respect.

145
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,030
- Yes, Teacher.
- Okay.

146
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:46,300
Joon Woo, move over to Gi Tae's seat.

147
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,980
- Gi Tae.
- Yes?

148
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,410
Thank you.

149
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,620
It's respect for the teacher.

150
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,200
Now, then.

151
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,770
Something's caught in my throat.
Just a minute.

152
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,430
I think he's totally bothered, right?

153
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:25,350
Wow, it's totally messing me up.

154
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:35,490
What's the matter with me?
Why am I so pitiful?

155
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:38,600
I'm the teacher.
I'm an adult.

156
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,280
Sorry.

157
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,960
Now, let's begin.

158
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,710
Teach, about our English performance assessment,

159
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:58,620
you didn't tell us about the listening test range.

160
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,900
Oh, that is...

161
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,800
Vice Principal!
Vice Principal! Shh!

162
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,090
But it's true!
Performance assessment.

163
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:16,690
Wasn't the listening test in place of the performance assessment? It was like that in our first year.

164
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:19,120
The listening test isn't the only thing
on the performance assessment.

165
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,920
We should be original and do free talking.

166
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,640
Come on! No!

167
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,230
No.

168
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,650
No way.

169
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:31,630
- What's the topic for free talking?
- Oh, that's good point.

170
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:34,560
The topic for that is

171
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,430
Oh, my dream.

172
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:40,500
No way!

173
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,700
No good!

174
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:50,930
Now, now, the format will be to team up
in groups of two and for three minutes do free talking.

175
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:54,930
The head of learning can make the rules
and pair up everyone randomly.

176
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:57,000
You agreed, okay?

177
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,940
M-Me?

178
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,530
No way.

179
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,440
Come on. You be quiet.

180
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,200
Let's do it together.

181
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,200
Anyway, let's do it.

182
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,370
Oh Han Gyeol. Let's be calm.

183
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:17,530
Be confident and at ease.

184
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,860
Dignity.

185
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,630
He's smiling.

186
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,700
Seriously, I'm totally losing it.

187
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,360
I told you! We have to send him off to get married.

188
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,730
Just accept it.
It doesn't count that much toward the grades.

189
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,730
Lesson nine!

190
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,670
Teacher, we're the only class that didn't
submit the education fund spending plan, right?

191
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,280
Just a second.
I'll quickly draw it up and—

192
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,680
No, the head of class submitted it this morning.

193
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:05,480
- Hui Yeong did?
- You're so lucky.

194
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,440
Hui Yeong does everything even though
he's busy with things of his own to do.

195
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,690
He's the top student in his grade and brings up
the class average and takes good care of his classmates.

196
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:17,240
You're very lucky this year even though
you're the assistant teacher, Teacher Oh.

197
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,140
I see that.

198
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,820
Hui Yeong.
What is it?

199
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:35,630
Teach.
Please reconsider free talking.

200
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:39,390
It doesn't matter to me, but it won't be easy
for the kids to prepare it in four days.

201
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:42,660
On top of that, it's midterm exams soon.

202
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,740
But still, this is a test, too.

203
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,860
Accomplishing the task at hand within the time given.

204
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,020
- That's assessment.
- Right.

205
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:54,860
Yes, but wouldn't it be risky to pair up people randomly?

206
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,210
It affects the academic records.

207
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,230
Hui Yeong, well, you...

208
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,790
You'll do well no matter with whom you're paired.

209
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:06,970
It's nice to help others who are lacking in their English skills.

210
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,600
Okay?

211
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,050
I understand.

212
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:15,810
Also, Hui Yeong.

213
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,000
Just a second.

214
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,160
That is...

215
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,090
Come here for a second.

216
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,690
Things like the education fund spending plan,

217
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,830
it's something I should do as the teacher.

218
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:35,660
I would have liked it if you had discussed it
with me before submitting it.

219
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,580
The student department head mentioned it to me.

220
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:43,380
Since you're the assistant teacher,
I thought it was okay for me to do it.

221
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:49,530
But still, I'm the teacher right now.

222
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,330
I'll be careful.

223
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:59,190
Teacher Oh, just make it easy for yourself.

224
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:04,310
If you take on a lot of things, once their teacher comes back,
it'll only create more things for you to have to hand over.

225
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:07,280
- I guess that's true.
- Right?

226
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,580
But, when is their teacher coming back?

227
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,590
I'm not sure.

228
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,950
Yes, Teacher. How are you?

229
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:32,230
I'm doing well, thanks to you.

230
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:35,600
It's like a hotel here.

231
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,960
Everything's good here.

232
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,000
About that investment I asked you about before.

233
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,960
I was wondering if it was going well.

234
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,260
You don't need to worry.

235
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:50,430
Oh, great. I'll do everything I can.

236
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,690
Eat up.

237
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:12,470
It's hard enough to study for the exam.
What's up with free talking?

238
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,940
Exactly.

239
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:17,810
It's always the teachers lacking in skills that are more driven.

240
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:21,220
He's not bad, don't you think?

241
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,920
Fine.

242
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:42,270
Oh, that transfer student.
Will he be okay here?

243
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,450
Didn't he steal the academy teacher's watch?

244
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:48,490
- He says he didn't.
- We don't know that.

245
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:50,000
How can we believe someone
who was forced to move schools?

246
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,600
I know.
The watch was found there.

247
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,390
But why do you take his side?

248
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,870
- I'm not.
- You are.

249
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,410
I'm not. What are you saying?

250
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,700
Da Huin. Oh Jae.

251
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:06,230
Oh! It's Oh Jae. Oh Jae!

252
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,030
Oh Jae!

253
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,540
Here.

254
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,570
There are no seats after coming back
from playing basketball.

255
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:31,330
That punk.
When we saved him a seat...

256
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,490
Why is he sitting there?

257
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,800
- So what?
- What do you mean by 'so what'?

258
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,330
True.

259
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,850
You like basketball?

260
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:46,930
Yeah, I do.
On top of that, I'm good at it.

261
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:00,300
If you look carefully, our class is a corporation.

262
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,610
Hui Yeong is the president.
The people next to him are his followers.

263
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:07,690
If he finishes eating and leaves,
they'll probably all get up to follow him.

264
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,720
It's funny, right?

265
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:13,410
Boys are... Seriously...

266
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:17,130
Even if you get just two together,
they're busy figuring out their ranks.

267
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,130
- What about you?
- Huh?

268
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,900
What are you like?

269
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,390
What do you think I'm like?

270
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,190
What are they doing?
Sizing each other up?

271
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,270
Well, just...

272
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,860
Just?

273
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,760
Just... a nice basketball player?

274
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,100
Correct.

275
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,140
What's a nice basketball player?
I've never heard that before.

276
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,120
Joon Woo!

277
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:02,990
You were no joke at your last school.
Not just this, but you must have been good at a lot of things.

278
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:06,390
What are you saying, Jo Sang Hoon, while we're eating? Go.

279
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,150
Sorry, bro.

280
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,030
Eat a lot.

281
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,440
What did Jo Sang Hoon say?

282
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,170
He said to eat the peas, too.

283
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,540
Well, that's a nice thing to say.

284
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,690
You're done eating?

285
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,930
Take your time eating.
Slowly.

286
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,670
Go ahead first.

287
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,010
You're scared, right?

288
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:25,530
That incident, that I will tell on you to the transfer student.

289
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,320
What incident?

290
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,620
Look at you pretending not to know.

291
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:34,730
Right.
You have to. It's more fun that way.

292
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,120
Jo Sang Hoon.

293
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,590
- Do you know something?
- What?

294
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,470
What?

295
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:42,510
You laughing like this,...

296
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,790
is really irritating.

297
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:47,640
I don't know what you're trying to say,

298
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,840
but do whatever you want.

299
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,230
Whether it's telling on me or whatever.

300
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:02,880
Okay, to be fair, let's do rock paper scissors
between the female and male representatives.

301
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,320
Losing team writes down the names
and the winning team picks, okay?

302
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,330
There are more guys.

303
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,750
It can't be helped.
The rest can pair up with themselves.

304
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,350
It's nerve-wracking.

305
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,960
Okay, start.

306
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,640
♬ Anything I don't want to hear,
everything you have to say ♬

307
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,110
♬ But when you start giving instructions,
I just gotta walk away ♬

308
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:33,890
♬ It just goes in one ear and out the other ♬

309
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:40,160
♬ It reminds me just a little too much
of my sweet mother. ♬

310
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,490
♬ I never could listen to what she had to say ♬

311
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:45,270
I had to run for cover.

312
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:50,910
♬ It just goes in one ear and out the other ♬

313
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,560
♬ You like talking about your feelings ♬

314
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,360
♬ I guess you always will ♬

315
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:05,800
♬ But I don't really wanna feel like I'm on Dr. Phil ♬

316
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:11,560
♬ You say it'll make us closer; it's driving us apart ♬

317
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:22,410
Lee Gi Tae?
You're so lucky, he's really good at English.

318
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,610
Next, Da Huin.

319
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:25,810
You're not going to pray?

320
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:30,060
I prayed before the PE exam and I got paired up with Pil Sang.

321
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,010
Please, as long as it's not Yoon Pil Sang.

322
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:34,810
Hey, hey, hey, I don't want you either.

323
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:37,920
- So, what?
- Same to you.

324
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,100
Is it Yoon Pil Sang again?

325
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,670
Oh, Jeong Oh Jae?

326
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:50,460
It's me?
Let's do well, Da Huin.

327
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,020
Okay.

328
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:55,440
Next, Ro Mi.

329
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:04,540
Why? Who is it?

330
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,420
- Who is it?
- Yoon Pil Sang!

331
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,830
Yes!

332
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:15,420
Ro Mi! Ro Mi!

333
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,730
She must hate it!

334
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,880
Oh, Chan Yeol.

335
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,040
It's Chan Yeol.

336
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,320
Sit, sit.
You do it first.

337
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,940
Okay, then I'll go first.

338
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:37,060
This has a unique shape.

339
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,650
It's a present.

340
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,800
Forget it.

341
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,550
Take it. I have a lot.

342
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,330
Who is in charge of recyling in your class?

343
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,090
What are you doing here?

344
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,480
I'm on duty here.

345
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,250
You're not preparing for English?
Free talking?

346
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,150
I should.

347
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,180
Who picked me?

348
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,950
Nobody picked me?

349
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,130
Choi Joon Woo.

350
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,170
When are you free?

351
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:49,830
Now is a little...

352
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:52,720
Wow, I picked you, and you're playing hard to get?

353
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,610
I'm not playing hard to get after you picked me.

354
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:00,030
I have to go to my part-time job now.

355
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,410
That...

356
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,530
I'm still too new to tell you about my personal situation.

357
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:12,940
I'm not free right now either.

358
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,670
I have to go somewhere.

359
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:18,920
Oh.

360
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,770
Okay then.

361
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:22,710
I'll text you later.

362
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,570
Choi Joon Woo.
What's your dream?

363
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:33,060
Dream?

364
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,520
I don't know.

365
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,650
Huh? What?
How are—

366
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,440
Okay.

367
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,970
Then for now, just think of anything
because we have to take the test. Okay?

368
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:01,680
Bye.

369
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:06,410
There are a few missing.

370
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:08,030
Are you done?
I'll hand it in.

371
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:10,260
Please hand it in if you're done writing.

372
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,780
Wait.

373
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:17,960
Why is it taking so long to write down names?

374
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:44,130
Choi Joon Woo's kind of cute.

375
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,830
He even knows to put a code on it.

376
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,800
For references, I checked all the quotes.

377
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:55,050
Hey, Ma Hui Yeong!

378
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:59,020
How can you just leave like that?
We're partners.

379
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,680
Yeah, let's do well.

380
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:07,740
What should we do?
Let's go to the cafeteria and talk about it over a latte.

381
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,940
What should I do?
I have to go right now.

382
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:12,860
I'll make the script by tomorrow.
Your part too.

383
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:17,260
You'll just have to memorize it.
Let's match everything up on test day. Bye.

384
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,660
How can you just leave like that?

385
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:24,540
Do you know my dream?
You don't know anything about me.

386
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,810
Don't worry.
I'll make sure we get a 100.

387
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:30,110
Just prepare for the midterms well.

388
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:35,330
Hey, Ma Hui Yeong! Hey!

389
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,430
Thank you!

390
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,670
Hello.

391
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,820
Park Yeong Bae, why are you coming now?

392
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,790
She's been waiting for you since earlier.

393
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,000
- Mom.
- You're arriving late.

394
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,690
That's what I'm saying.
He's always five minutes late.

395
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:00,430
Choi Joon Woo, you can't be like that
when you're working for someone.

396
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:04,000
You should come 15 minutes early,
and get in the right mindset,

397
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,790
and prepare yourself for work.

398
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:11,550
Mom. Did something happen?
Why all of a sudden?

399
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,570
I had something to do, and I had time left.

400
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,250
Then why didn't you go home instead?

401
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:21,380
You're working here, so why would I?
I have to go back soon.

402
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,310
Let's go eat.

403
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,350
I have to work.

404
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,570
She already got permission from the boss.

405
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:30,910
Of course, it needed some of my input as well.

406
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:32,620
It's good.

407
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,130
It's good?

408
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:37,170
Eat some.

409
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:45,730
You're not...
Because of the watch incident,

410
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:48,590
you're not losing self-confidence at school, are you?

411
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:50,150
Don't worry, I'm not.

412
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:55,040
Right, since the truth will come out someday.

413
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:59,870
Right. You're not keeping in touch
with the kids from the last school, are you?

414
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:02,510
Jeong Woo. Sin Jeong Woo.

415
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:04,880
- Jeong Woo hasn't called?
- No.

416
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:12,170
But then again, he has to have
a conscience after making you transfer.

417
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:14,770
He's not a bad kid.
You know that.

418
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:19,540
I know.
I liked him a lot, too.

419
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:29,400
When I think about that day,

420
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:36,150
it's so unfair and upsetting.

421
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:39,900
Mom.

422
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,970
Okay, I'm not crying.

423
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:46,780
Anyway, you really...

424
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:49,400
Just study hard from now on, too.

425
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,040
Don't get involved in things. Got it?

426
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,090
Okay.

427
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:57,800
- Promise.
- Promise.

428
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,860
Don't cry.

429
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:09,430
Mom. You came because you were worried about me, right?
Not because you had something to do?

430
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:11,930
No.

431
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,500
- You're lying.
- I am not.

432
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:21,950
Let's eat.

433
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,970
Why is this so hard?

434
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:54,530
Let's do your best, Soo Bin.

435
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:58,470
Go, Mom.
You'll be late for the bus.

436
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:00,820
Let's walk a little more first.

437
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:05,130
I told you to move your hair off your forehead.

438
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,380
- Just a little bit.
- I'll do it.

439
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,380
No, it's better if you can see it.

440
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,340
I'll do it.

441
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:19,560
Hello.

442
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,960
Is she in your class?
Hi, I'm Joon Woo's mom.

443
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,010
Oh. Hello.

444
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,390
Hell...o.

445
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:28,090
Hello.

446
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:36,450
Then we're busy, so...
See you again.

447
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:38,370
Bye.

448
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:45,240
Who is that?
He's cute.

449
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,120
He's a new transfer student in our class.

450
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,360
Mom.

451
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,050
So embarrassing.

452
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:54,310
I think that was a real bag.

453
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:57,100
That's a fake.

454
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,200
She must be embarrassed, right?

455
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,070
But still, people carry them around.

456
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:06,230
They said the real one costs over 10 million won.
Are they rich?

457
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,180
I don't know.

458
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,470
But is that really his mom?
She's so young.

459
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:10,970
I don't know.
Let's go.

460
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:12,820
Isn't he too handsome?

461
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,860
I-I don't know.

462
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:17,010
Class is on a whole another level.

463
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:19,040
I should be careful.

464
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:30,400
No, I really can't speak English.

465
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,780
You're basically a pro at this level.

466
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,820
I think I met a good partner.

467
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:41,290
Where are you?

468
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,050
I'm waiting for Hui Yeong.

469
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,690
What do I do?

470
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:58,580
Oh Jae thinks he met a good partner.

471
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:00,110
Be quiet.

472
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,860
She's acting like she's going to marry him.

473
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,380
I'm here.

474
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,100
Soo Bin, where were you?

475
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:13,210
Your mom came by the school, right?

476
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:15,860
She wanted to look for an academy.

477
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:18,460
Your mom is...

478
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:23,060
Your free talking for English,
what are you going to do? Choi Joon Woo?

479
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,730
That's right.

480
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,910
So annoying.

481
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:29,630
How am I supposed to do it with Pil Sang?

482
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:32,710
Choi Joon Woo won't be easy either.

483
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,070
- Work hard.
- Bye.

484
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,350
Choi Joon Woo,

485
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:52,490
can you send me five sentences in English?
Anything will do.

486
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:57,980
Why?

487
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,650
Why?

488
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,350
For the level test.
To see how good your English is.

489
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,910
Does that sound too obnoxious?

490
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,930
I wanted to know what your English style was like.

491
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:21,850
As a reference.

492
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:32,840
Park Yeong Bae, I'm going home.

493
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,750
Work hard.

494
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:39,750
Wait.
You speak a little English, don't you?

495
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:40,890
Of course.

496
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:43,830
Then could you help me with an English composition?

497
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,820
Yeah. Dad did?

498
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,610
Wait!

499
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,000
What's with him?

500
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,670
Choi Joon Woo.

501
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,720
Choi Joon Woo.

502
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:07,030
Choi Joon Woo.

503
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,870
Ah, how do I do this English paper?

504
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:15,250
Choi Joon Woo.

505
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:38,270
Ma Hui Yeong?

506
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,180
Choi Joon Woo?

507
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,320
Welc—

508
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,880
Is it going well?
The free talking preparation?

509
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:58,990
Sort of.

510
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:01,900
Sort of won't do.

511
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,210
Yoo Soo Bin's English is at the top level.

512
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:08,370
If her grades, her English,
and her exams are ruined because of you,

513
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:10,860
how are you going to be responsible for that?

514
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,000
I'll have to make it so that I don't ruin it.

515
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:21,780
Don't worry. I'll deal with it myself.

516
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:32,130
I don't think it's something someone like you could deal with.

517
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:38,020
I can help you.

518
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:43,710
Not for your but for Soo Bin's sake.
Since she's my girlfriend.

519
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:53,650
You're not scratching it these days?

520
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:54,840
Huh?

521
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:58,170
You scratch when you're nervous.
Over here.

522
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:04,160
I think you must be feeling very nervous.
Over various matters.

523
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,420
Welcome!

524
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,640
Hui Yeong.

525
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:43,820
I was out seeing Byeongmun High School kids.

526
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,570
I took good care of it.

527
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:49,410
Good? How?

528
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:58,360
- Look.
- Sheesh.

529
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,850
Are you joking?

530
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:03,360
Give us more.
Let's finish it off cleanly.

531
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,360
Fine, I'll give you more.

532
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,770
Where are you going?

533
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:10,470
Give us more!

534
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:12,890
They'll do well on their own.

535
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:15,950
They promised to get Choi Joon Woo expelled.

536
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,880
You worked hard.

537
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:23,020
How did you do with the midterms?
Did you do well?

538
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,530
Me?

539
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:30,460
There should be one more study coach group.
My mom is looking into some teachers.

540
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,940
I'll let you in the group.
Just come.

541
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,260
Really?

542
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,400
I really needed it.
Thanks, Hui Yeong.

543
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,270
I'll work hard.

544
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:40,310
I'll see you tomorrow.

545
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:42,960
Get home safely!

546
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:06,540
I'm home.

547
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,070
Mom.

548
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,100
She's sleeping.
Don't wake her up.

549
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:52,900
Mom, are you okay?

550
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,500
- Are you going home?
- Yes.

551
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,390
Wait a minute.

552
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,610
Did something happen?

553
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:20,790
No.

554
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,000
- Work hard.
- Okay. Bye.

555
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:28,710
Twenty Four 7

556
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,680
I can help you.

557
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,700
Not for your but for Soo Bin's sake.
Since she's my girlfriend.

558
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:50,660
What girlfriend?
We're just friends.

559
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:53,000
Right?
Ma Hui Yeong, kiddo?

560
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,780
Who's right?

561
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:13,250
Choi Joon Woo, have you been well?

562
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,480
Let's meet up.

563
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:34,090
Are you ignoring me?
Fine.

564
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,420
Choi Joon Woo

565
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,350
Seriously.

566
00:42:57,350 --> 00:43:00,110
Choi Joon Woo, that rock head.

567
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:33,130
Home?

568
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,730
Yeah.

569
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:44,430
What are you doing?

570
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:51,450
I guess you're feeling down seeing that
you're asking what I'm doing, Ma Hui Yeong kiddo.

571
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:56,350
No, just because.
I just thought of you.

572
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:04,180
By the way, what did Teacher Son Jae Yeong
say about my level test?

573
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:07,090
He hasn't said anything yet.

574
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:10,000
I guess I failed.

575
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,770
What do I do?
My mom won't let this slide.

576
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,040
What's wrong with you, Choi Joon Woo?

577
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,840
If English sentences are hard,
just tell me what your dream is then.

578
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,880
In Korean.

579
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,490
Oh.

580
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:44,720
My dream?
To sleep with the lights off.

581
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:48,140
Sleep with the lights off?

582
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:51,550
Sleep?

583
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:56,900
Ah! What's that?

584
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:00,550
Named Best High School for learning.

585
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:03,300
How can they get out of the game Son Heung Min?
(soccer player)

586
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,850
The referee had to be corrupt.

587
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:07,610
Tackle!

588
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:13,610
I tried. That's right.

589
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:14,950
Does he play soccer?

590
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:16,080
I don't know that.

591
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,120
- He looks like he can't.
- Who knows?

592
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:18,790
Who can know?

593
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:23,150
Yoo Soo Bin's at the top level in English.
Because of you, if her grades and English are ruined,

594
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:26,060
and if she messed up her exam,
how will you take responsibility?

595
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,800
- How did you do?
- What?

596
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,750
No, don't ever do that.

597
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:33,390
To Teacher Son Jae Yeong,
you don't need to put in a good word for me.

598
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:38,030
If I don't do well on the test, nothing can be done.
That's my limit.

599
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:41,910
Don't worry, Yoon Soo Bin.
You won't fail. You're good at it.

600
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:45,180
Hey, Transfer Student.
You never answer when I call.

601
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:46,190
What position do you play?

602
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:49,630
Is the English free talking preparation going well?
With Choi Joon Woo?

603
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:54,270
I don't know. It's daunting.

604
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:00,220
Choi Joon Woo? Hey!

605
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:01,950
I'll go first.

606
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:03,600
Hey, transfer student! What position do you play?
Be the goalkeeper, jerk!

607
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:06,590
Be the goalkeeper, you jerk!

608
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,200
Let's run. Hey, punk!

609
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:18,340
Yoo Soo Bin.

610
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:23,530
What's that?

611
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:26,610
Your dream is what?
Sleeping with the lights off?

612
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:29,910
- Are you joking?
- Your English partner.

613
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:32,640
If you want to switch, go ahead.

614
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:36,780
I'm bad in English, and I don't really have a dream either.

615
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:42,510
Don't ruin your exams because of me,
and change partners.

616
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:46,360
You're so thick-faced.

617
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:51,320
You didn't even answer my text
and then later sent a strange text.

618
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:54,390
And now what?

619
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:55,890
Strange?

620
00:47:55,890 --> 00:47:58,480
At the performance assessments, too.

621
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,760
I was being considerate of you, so...

622
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,380
You can't be so difficult like this.

623
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:07,910
Why are you being considerate of me?

624
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:12,410
Because I look pathetic like a loser?

625
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:18,390
You must feel a sense of duty or something,
wanting to help when you see kids like me.

626
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:27,170
I'm thankful for that, but it's okay.

627
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,560
You don't have to be that considerate.

628
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:36,890
Why did you draw the peas?

629
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:38,740
Together... You weren't asking for help?

630
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:42,870
Weren't you asking for me to help?

631
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:45,650
Because you wanted to do well, too?

632
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:55,010
I usually draw stuff like that.

633
00:48:55,010 --> 00:48:57,020
Like a habit.

634
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:02,500
I should switch partners.

635
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:08,140
What are you doing, Choi Joon Woo?

636
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:13,070
Poet Kim So Wol gave importance to the structure of poems.

637
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:15,050
If you look closely at this...

638
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:16,380
Peas?

639
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:17,730
You want to eat peas?

640
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:20,100
The top and bottom have symmetry...

641
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:21,620
No.

642
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:30,390
If you lay the poem on its side, it'll look like a mountain.

643
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:34,390
That's how he wanted it to be.

644
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,390
On the next verse...

645
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:43,490
So, look at...

646
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:10,690
Here.

647
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:13,000
I wrote my dream.

648
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:17,990
I'll try to memorize it if you write it down for me in English.

649
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:29,960
Are... are you okay?

650
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:34,890
What's up with him?

651
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:38,800
Stop.

652
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,090
Why can't I see?

653
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:43,290
Where are you going?

654
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,120
To the restroom.

655
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:04,860
My dream is to fall asleep in a dark room with the lights off.

656
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:09,660
Since I was little, I had to sleep by myself a lot,
so I slept with the lights on.

657
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:12,050
If you turned the lights off, zombies

658
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:14,960
ghosts, or monsters,

659
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,380
I felt like they would come to harm me.

660
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:21,860
But even now, I still sleep with the lights on,

661
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:24,530
not because I'm scared of ghosts but...

662
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:34,050
Oh, head of study, please sit down.

663
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:44,230
Do you want to practice English?
At the cafeteria after school?

664
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:46,330
Is the EF (English free talking) prep going well?

665
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:48,020
- Yes!
- No!

666
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:49,890
Can't I change partners?

667
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:51,460
No, you can't.

668
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:54,270
Why? I'm good at English.

669
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:57,740
Not crazy about school.
How about the park after school?

670
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:02,000
Anyway, prepare the EF well,

671
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,800
and see you tomorrow! Fighting!

672
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:08,150
Bye.

673
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:11,790
Fighting.

674
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:13,950
Fine, I give in, rockhead.

675
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:17,060
Okay.

676
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,770
Yes, Teacher.

677
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:31,090
Yoo Soo Bin, are her level test results out yet?

678
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:33,470
Hey! Wait!

679
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:35,850
I'll leave first!

680
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,590
Yes.

681
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:53,400
What's up with my heart?

682
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,450
It's annoying, that's why.

683
00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:58,680
How am I going to teach that rockhead?

684
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,570
Hello?

685
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:38,820
Sorry, something urgent came up.

686
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,510
Jeong Woo.

687
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:58,670
Oh! Choi Joon Woo! It's been a while!

688
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:03,380
You're loyal just as we thought. You ignored our texts,
yet run here when your best friend texts you.

689
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:05,110
Are you okay, Jeong Woo?

690
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:07,970
Yeah. I'm fine.

691
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:12,000
Are you disappointed that he's okay
after running here in a hurry?

692
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,310
Since you're here, let's get some exercise.

693
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:18,170
Are you nervous?

694
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:21,090
Choi Joon Woo!
Aren't you going to fight?

695
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:23,130
Even if I do this?

696
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:25,010
Even if I do this?

697
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:25,870
You told me you wouldn't do this.

698
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:27,270
When did I say that?

699
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:28,250
Are you mad, jerk?

700
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:29,880
You are a loser.

701
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,030
- Ow!
- What, punk?

702
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:33,060
Your friend is dying!

703
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:37,260
Hey, come here I said. Did you forget about
your friend after transferring to a good school?

704
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:39,130
You want to just save yourself?

705
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:40,570
I told you not to do that.

706
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:42,890
- Ouch!
- This punk.

707
00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:49,240
Just study from now on
and don't get mixed up with things.

708
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,480
I said come here, you punk!

709
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,750
Come fight!
Don't leave!

710
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:56,060
Your friend is going to die today!

711
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:58,390
I said not to do that, you punk!

712
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:05,530
Choi Joon Woo.

713
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:07,180
Joon Woo!

714
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:09,380
You are a jerk!

715
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:15,400
This punk, showing off.

716
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,640
Huh?!

717
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:21,350
Hey, Choi Joon Woo!

718
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:23,360
The cops are here.

719
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,400
Leave!

720
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:29,880
You're dead if we catch you!

721
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,960
Hurry up! Sin Jeong Woo!

722
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:40,160
My mom's not home today!

723
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:43,330
Joon Woo!
Wait for me!

724
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,900
Why do you live like this?
Do you think I got expelled so you could live like this?

725
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:07,550
You felt at ease, right?

726
00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:09,960
Since you left like that,

727
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:12,470
after making me feel so guilty?

728
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:14,670
I told you to go somewhere and start fresh, too.

729
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:16,840
Ridiculous.

730
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:22,890
How can I?
It's always the same no matter where I go.

731
00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:26,730
For punks like us, anywhere we go is hell.

732
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,400
Jeong Woo, why do you think like that?

733
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,980
You weren't like this before.

734
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:38,380
Choi Joon Woo

735
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:44,120
Do you think things like that will make things change?

736
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:46,250
Never.

737
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:49,870
Since our lives were ruined the day we were born.

738
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:54,280
I'm going now.

739
00:56:56,970 --> 00:56:58,370
Jeong Woo.

740
00:56:58,370 --> 00:57:01,350
Hey.
♬ Everywhere I go ♬

741
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:04,990
♬ you are always there with me ♬

742
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:08,640
♬ And I was always scared to face the truth ♬

743
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,130
Mom. When are you coming?
♬ Now I’m still ♬

744
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:12,860
Today too?
♬ Waiting right here for you ♬

745
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:15,690
Mom, what time are you coming?

746
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:20,330
Choi Joon Woo! Joon Woo!
♬ Just like the days, ♬

747
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:27,310
♬ we were young and fumbling ♬

748
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:29,250
I thought you'd be scared.
♬ Everything fades away ♬

749
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:33,690
Hey, Sin Jeong Woo.
♬ Let it go by with a flow ♬

750
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:38,260
♬ Really wish I could stay, but you know me ♬

751
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:41,420
You're not scared anymore, right?
Since I'm here?

752
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:45,220
Yeah. It was my dream to sleep with the lights off.

753
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:47,360
Sleep.
♬ Are not going anywhere ♬

754
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:53,400
You scaredy cat.
♬ Never quite understood it ♬

755
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:10,380
♬ All the moments we shared ♬

756
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:14,160
♬ are not going anywhere♬

757
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:18,550
Right. Choi Joon Woo is like that.

758
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:22,770
Irresponsible and a flake of a punk.

759
00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:26,690
♬ and I be right by your side♬

760
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:29,040
Let's get it together, Yoo Soo Bin.

761
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:34,160
♬ Cuz memories don't say goodbye♬

762
00:58:36,370 --> 00:58:38,090
Soo Bin!

763
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:42,890
My daughter. Yoo Soo Bin!
Come here.

764
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:46,660
You got accepted into Teacher Son Jae Yeong's class.

765
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:48,380
Come here.
Let's celebrate.

766
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:51,300
We're here!

767
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:52,410
Hello.

768
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:55,400
Soo Bin, congratulations.
You worked hard.

769
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,940
Yes, congratulations.

770
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:02,530
Well, I worked hard, but Hui Yeong did, too.

771
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:07,560
I hope you'll work hard, even if it's to save Hui Yeong's face.

772
00:59:08,790 --> 00:59:11,970
She will. That's great.

773
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:15,070
Are you okay?

774
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,400
Just stay still.

775
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,900
Stay still.

776
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:20,590
Here, here.

777
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:22,580
Yes, yes, yes.

778
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:25,650
Just move your foot.

779
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:26,850
Yes.

780
00:59:26,850 --> 00:59:28,500
This side.

781
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,410
Yes, yes.

782
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,940
Soo Bin. Soo Bin!

783
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:40,380
Soo Bin's mom, are you okay?

784
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:42,350
I'm fine.

785
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:47,020
I'm so happy.

786
00:59:56,310 --> 01:00:00,630
Hey! How can you just come in?
Sit out there for a bit.

787
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:06,480
Are you her servant?
Did I get into the class because of her?

788
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,870
Of course.

789
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:11,900
You couldn't have made it without Hui Yeong.

790
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:15,000
I tested fine. It's not because of him.

791
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,550
Don't be ridiculous.

792
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:20,840
How can you get in with your math skills?
You're not at the top level.

793
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:26,030
Mom. Seriously.
I'm embarrassed.

794
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:28,630
Who cares if you can brag about Seoul University at work?

795
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:34,540
Being like this to that ahjumma, it's really humiliating.

796
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:39,040
Who are we talking about here?
Who made me like this?

797
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:43,190
Who made the great me into a servant like this?

798
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:45,230
Don't nag and come out.

799
01:00:45,230 --> 01:00:47,420
I don't want to.

800
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:53,770
Come out. They're forming groups for other subjects.
You have to make a good impression.

801
01:00:53,770 --> 01:00:54,690
- I don't want to.
- Come here.

802
01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:55,760
I don't want to!

803
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,720
Come out. Come out.

804
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:00,190
Be safe!

805
01:01:01,850 --> 01:01:02,730
What to do?

806
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:07,400
She has bad menstrual cramps and is out of medicine.

807
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:10,220
Oh, I see. She's very sensitive.

808
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:46,880
Oh, there.

809
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:49,220
Yes, yes.

810
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,810
It's raining, too.

811
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,390
You...

812
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:15,050
Why are you...

813
01:03:22,830 --> 01:03:24,840
You don't have an umbrella?

814
01:03:25,650 --> 01:03:28,180
That's why I'm like this.

815
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:34,000
I don't have one either.

816
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:48,260
So... what?
You have something to say?

817
01:03:52,230 --> 01:03:54,030
But where did you get so...

818
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:56,190
I do have something to say.

819
01:03:58,070 --> 01:03:59,710
What?

820
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:08,680
You don't even have anything to say.

821
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:13,510
You left so suddenly after promising to meet up.

822
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:17,650
I wanted to tell you not to get rained on.

823
01:04:17,650 --> 01:04:19,150
Huh?

824
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:23,470
What I wanted to say.

825
01:04:23,470 --> 01:04:28,080
Getting rained on is not good for you.

826
01:04:56,190 --> 01:04:59,840
♬ The day the small door opens ♬

827
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:05,030
♬ And the world is different ♬

828
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:08,720
♬ That type of happiness is my all ♬

829
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:14,560
♬ It's stunningly brilliant ♬

830
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:19,830
♬ It makes the hand I lent sad ♬

831
01:05:19,830 --> 01:05:23,740
♬ I carefully say goodbye ♬

832
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:30,780
♬ And send you my thoughts ♬

833
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:34,920
♬ I was colored dark ♬

834
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:42,470
♬ And because of that so were you ♬

835
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:47,840
♬ The heart that is fading and hurt ♬

836
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:54,090
♬ Love in a color ♬

837
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:56,940
♬ Is blended in ♬

838
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:01,450
Moment at Eighteen
~ Preview~

839
01:06:01,450 --> 01:06:03,020
It was in my pocket.

840
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:05,380
Why don't you ask why I'm walking around like this?

841
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:09,560
Why don't you ask why I look like this?

842
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:10,640
What's that mask?

843
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:12,610
You're not some idol. Come here.

844
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:13,440
What's the matter with your face?

845
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,990
I wanted to meet with Joon Woo's last homeroom teacher.

846
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:17,990
This is really your dream?

847
01:06:17,990 --> 01:06:20,020
What about you?
Fifty times?

848
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:21,320
Ten more then.

849
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:24,680
Why are you always so-so with me?

850
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:27,130
You being my girlfriend, too.

851
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:28,310
Sin Jeong Woo!

852
01:06:28,310 --> 01:06:30,280
Stop, Jeong Woo, Jeong Woo!

853
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:34,540
Jeong Woo, our lives aren't ruined.
