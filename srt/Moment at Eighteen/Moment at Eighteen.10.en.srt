1
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,060
And you believed that?

2
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,200
More than me?

3
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,160
I see.

4
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:42,080
I did it all because of you.
I will explain everything.

5
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,830
Choi Joon Woo.

6
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,460
Why did you do it?

7
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,650
You must have known it would come to light anyway.

8
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,610
Didn't you consider what Soo Bin would think of you?

9
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,730
Why do you think she was influenced by a mere text?

10
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,500
It's because she doesn't trust you.

11
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,370
Because the fact that you're a troublemaker
and problematic is always in her head.

12
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,860
Know your place, Choi Joon Woo.

13
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,230
She's not someone you can freely like.

14
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:20,220
Aren't you feeling sorry toward Soo Bin?

15
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,480
You caused a wound to someone you like.

16
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:34,000
Soo Bin seems to be one of the few people
you show your true feelings to so why do that to her?

17
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,350
Shut up.
Shut up, Choi Joon Woo.

18
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,430
What do you know?

19
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,020
What do you know?!

20
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,980
Dummy.
You should have trusted him.

21
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,820
Oh Je, do you know where Choi Joon Woo's house is?

22
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,820
Why I came...
What if he asks why I came?

23
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,300
- Choi Joon—
- Joon Woo! What are you doing up there?

24
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,060
Oh, Mom.

25
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,290
Give them to me.
Why did you buy so much?

26
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,600
I have to make some side dishes for tomorrow.

27
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,800
Doesn't the eatery you work for make their own?

28
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,600
Oh, I'm learning to make some dishes there these days.

29
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,430
It's homework from the chef.

30
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:37,580
I should study hard while the eatery is under construction.

31
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,150
Joon Woo.

32
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:45,050
Did something happen?
What's wrong?

33
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,480
It's nothing.

34
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,300
You're lying.
Your face shows it.

35
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,930
"Not in a good mood. Don't bother me."

36
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,420
Not true.

37
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,650
Let's go.

38
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:18,340
Are you at Chan Yeol's? Do you know what time it is?
Hurry up and come home.

39
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:46,160
Choi Joon Woo, sorry.
For not trusting you.

40
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,690
I'm the problem.
For not making you trust in me.

41
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,590
No. I should have verified it with you.

42
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,600
But I wasn't able to because...

43
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:31,500
No matter how much I think about it,
I don't think I deserve you.

44
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,850
♬ Please don’t say a word ♬

45
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:55,950
♬ Cuz they all have been said now ♬

46
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:59,530
♬ Like a journey coming to an end ♬

47

That Night Which Will Never Return

48
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:02,610

♬ Are not going ♬

60
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,130

00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:24,720
♬ we were young and fumbling ♬

74
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,210
♬ Everything fades away ♬

75
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,920
I think I need a little time.

76
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,660
You understand, right?

77
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,520
Don't take too long.

78
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,600
I'm sorry.

79
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:44,350
♬ Just close your eyes and I'll be right by your side ♬

80
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,180
That the energy of a moving object remains constant

81
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:52,390
is the law of conservation of mechanical energy.

82
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,990
- You like roller coaster rides, don't you?
- Yes.

83
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,390
The roller coaster demonstrates this law the best

84
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,290
in the transition from potential energy to kinetic energy.

85
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:07,330
The roller coasters move without
an engine by following the height.

86
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,590
That's best way to demonstrate this
is the energy in changing position.

87
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,670
- What's the matter with them?
- That's what I'm saying.

88
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,290
The rollercoaster goes from a high place

89
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,600
and then while moving down to a lower place like this,

90
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,390
potential energy is reduced and kinetic energy is increased.

91
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:25,320
Now, let'ss look at this. The 10-kilogram object that's
stationary on the ground, in a vertical direction...

92
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,440
Soo Bin.

93
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,660
Why aren't you getting mad at me?

94
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:40,270
You know that I lied.

95
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:43,490
Nothing changes by being mad now.

96
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,390
Right now,

97
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,660
I'm just trying to understand

98
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,540
my longtime friend

99
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,120
by putting myself in Ma Hui Yeong kiddo's position.

100
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,490
There must have been a reason for it.

101
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,460
That's the kind of thought I'm having.

102
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,150
Soo Bin.

103
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,900
Hui Yeong.

104
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:23,570
Just once, I'd like you to think about it really hard

105
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:31,460
about what feelings you have for me.
Your true feelings.

106
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:41,210
Whether you did it because you really like me...
or for some other reason.

107
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:53,030
I thought I was going to suffocate to death.
What's up with you two?

108
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:57,060
I know. What's up with you guys?

109
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,990
Just, we decided to be friends.

110
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,560
Really?

111
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,030
That's understandable.

112
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,970
It's not easy to break through your mom's close surveillance.

113
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:12,750
It might be better for now in
order to protect Choi Joon Woo's feelings.

114
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,460
So Ye, did you not make up with Gi Tae?

115
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,330
Hey, how can you forgive that?

116
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,570
When he chooses friendship over love?

117
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:26,340
What kind of love, what kind of friendship is that?

118
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:30,870
He was just loyal to his task.
The task of being a butler to Ma Hui Yeong.

119
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:38,180
What's up with you guys?

120
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,120
You're blatantly excluding me?

121
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,050
Did you just realize that?

122
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,340
Oh... we looked for you but we didn't see you.

123
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,690
You think it's over, right?
Between you and Choi Joon Woo.

124
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,640
So it's true.

125
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:57,830
Wow, she needs to disappear or something.

126
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,150
It's so yummy.

127
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,890
Ma Hui Yeong did?

128
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,090
Yeah.

129
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:10,130
- Flabbergasted, right?
- Like a grade-schooler.

130
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:16,220
Well, it is a ridiculous grade-schooler type of act, but

131
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,980
don't you think it's sort of understandable?

132
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:26,060
If you lose your mind for a moment—

133
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,740
Hey, Jeong Oh Je.

134
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,380
Well, I'm just saying it is possible to do that.

135
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,120
Talk to Soo Bin soon and make up quickly.

136
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,870
Why make it so complicated and analyze and argue and—

137
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:42,470
Yoo Pil Sang! Seriously, Yoo Pil Sang.

138
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,240
Hey, I told you to stop, didn't I?

139
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,380
Pil Sang, Joon Woo has antennas right here.

140
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,010
Let's stop, huh?

141
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,040
Pil Sang.

142
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:59,260
Please don't do this to me and go to Ro Mi.

143
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,270
- Go and confess.
- Are you nuts?

144
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,470
Do I have a death wish?

145
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:07,060
Do you want to just die or date Ro Mi?

146
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,500
Have some courage, even if it kills you.

147
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,310
Ro Mi.

148
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,510
I like you.

149
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,310
I know. Don't.

150
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,960
- I want to date you.
- No thanks.

151
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,510
Don't say no unconditionally.

152
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:30,170
Think about it for a few days,
about how I might be as your boyfriend.

153
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:31,870
I'm asking you.

154
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,330
Tell me your answer by the school trip.

155
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,040
Wow, to me, Pil Sang is becoming almost cool.

156
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,300
Choi Joon Woo, you did something good.

157
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:56,270
"Have some courage, even if it kills you."

158
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,870
Like a scene from a drama.

159
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,740
What're you saying?

160
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,240
I'm really...

161
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,840
Who am I to give advice...

162
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,360
when I can't even do it?

163
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:20,760
So because you're curious about these petty things,

164
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,600
you've been repeatedly contacting the old homeroom teacher?

165
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,580
What are you trying to dig up?

166
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:39,280
The call cannot be completed.
Please check the number and try again.

167
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,240
Teach, someone is here to see you.

168
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,860
Let them in.

169
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,230
Oh, my...

170
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:07,580
I was going to return it to you right away,
but I had an interview.

171
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:11,310
Oh, you must be busy,
but you came all the way here to the school.

172
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,900
- I'm not busy.
- I see.

173
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,690
I guess you did well in the interview. You seem happy.

174
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,820
I failed.

175
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,870
I'm sorry.

176
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,930
Then. Goodbye.

177
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,660
- Wait, Ji Min!
- Yes?

178
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,430
Last time—

179
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:36,540
Last time when I got you a cab, and now for bringing
your bag today, you want to buy me a drink or a meal.

180
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,980
No, thank you.

181
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,580
- Then—
- Then asking about buying me a cup of tea,

182
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,960
no thank you.

183
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,340
I'm a little busy. Work hard.

184
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:51,320
It's not about that. It's not about a meal, drink or tea.

185
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,590
"To be honest, I'm kind of attracted to you,
so I want to date you."

186
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:02,280
If it's something like that, then it's really a no, thank you.

187
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,650
It's not that either.

188
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,790
The thing is, you seemed to be
having a hard time, too, last time.

189
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,470
I wanted to tell you to hang in there.

190
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:15,350
Everything will turn out well, that's why.
Thanks for the bag.

191
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,560
Get back safely.

192
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:22,450
Today is not the only day, after all.

193
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:25,320
Oh, dragonfly!

194
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,200
Good morn...

195
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:35,400
Now, there's some good news.

196
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:40,480
The idea that our VP Choi Joon Woo came up with

197
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,020
has been chosen as the main event
of the school trip for the entire grade two class!

198
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,390
Give a big hand!

199
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,590
- But why is he so excited?
- I know.

200
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:02,070
Since we're doing it anyway, let's prepare for it well

201
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:06,540
so that we can come in first at games
and in the entire grade. The prize is an air purifier.

202
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,330
Let's do it!

203
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:12,490
I guess he really wants the air purifier.

204
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:16,210
Yeah.

205
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,270
I knew it would be like this.

206
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,310
Dad's clothes are missing.

207
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:47,380
Why would I keep old dirty clothes?
I threw them all away.

208
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,020
But still, I need it.

209
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,090
Then buy something.

210
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:56,070
How can I buy a part of your memory?

211
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:59,460
Seriously... I'll go home and check.

212
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,400
Please be that diligent about studying.

213
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,940
Hello?

214
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,720
She hung up, this girl.

215
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,440
- Cosplay for the school trip?
- Yes.

216
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,800
- That idea was suggested by our Joon—
- Seriously, I wonder who came up with that idea.

217
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,140
I'm sure it was by someone who's not into studying.

218
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,780
Why did you make a bento box?
I could have just bought something to eat.

219
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,570
You always buy your food.

220
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:28,040
Now, since your hands aren't feeling good ...

221
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,200
Thank you.

222
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,050
You must have been very popular
with the boys when you were young.

223
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,100
No way!

224
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,670
I dated just once.

225
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:41,390
With my son's dad. First love.

226
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:45,540
Oh, really?
Then you never dated anyone else after you split up?

227
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:49,590
Well, there were a few, but they weren't so great.

228
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:52,070
There was no one as good as Joon Woo's dad.

229
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,710
I see.

230
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:57,390
- I'll enjoy it.
- Yes.

231
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,570
What is your son going to do for the school trip cosplay?

232
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:05,100
He has his dad's clothes.

233
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,120
I kept some as a memory.

234
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,050
To commemorate?

235
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:14,460
Your dad wore it on our first date.

236
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,800
He was so cool that day.

237
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,110
Still, they must have been in love, no?

238
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:26,570
Back then. In that moment...

239
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,720
Mom, can I come in?

240
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,460
Oh, wait a minute.

241
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,920
What is it, son?

242
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,880
What?

243
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,060
Is this the time to be thinking about that kind of stuff?

244
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:02,540
Soo Bin's in charge of that, right?
So you're trying to help her?

245
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:08,150
No. I'm the president, so I should help the kids out, that's why.

246
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:11,420
Go upstairs and study.
I'll get something ready for you.

247
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,220
What if dad finds out?

248
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,800
Yeah, Representative Park.
It's me, Park Geum Ja.

249
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,510
Get a suit prepared for our Hui Yeong.

250
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,430
Oh, good. Retro style.

251
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:42,280
Are you going on a honeymoon, Yoon Da Huin?

252
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:46,340
- Oh, you're pretty.
- Ro Mi, today you are pretty.

253
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,200
Wow, what is this now?

254
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,790
What's up with everyone?

255
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:56,670
Hey, good morning, everyone.

256
00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:00,390
- Is everyone here? VP and President, please take attendance.
- Okay.

257
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,300
Isn't that Jo Sang Hoon?

258
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,060
Didn't he go to Singapore?

259
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,620
Hi guys.

260
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,780
Sang Hoon, how are you here?

261
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:33,510
Hello, Teacher. I wanted to go on the trip, too,
so I quickly came over from Singapore on a duck boat.

262
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,840
What happened?

263
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,880
I'll tell you later.

264
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,450
Guys!

265
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:43,170
Jo Sang Hoon!
Hey! Jo Sang Hoon!

266
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:48,990
Then first, let's get on the bus.
Don't get on the wrong bus!

267
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,530
This, this is...

268
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:55,120
Go away.

269
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:03,880
Pil Sang, don't pick and just sit. Accept it.

270
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,430
Come on.

271
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,760
Joon Woo.

272
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,820
Sit here.

273
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,640
That, that fox.

274
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,080
I'll sit in the back.

275
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:32,550
Looky here.
You've lost all your fears, huh?

276
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:35,130
- Go past me.
- Hurry up!

277
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,660
Please.

278
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,800
I wonder when we'll start going.

279
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:48,420
What? So Jo Sang Hoon didn't transfer then?

280
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,720
- His transfer papers weren't even submitted.
- Really?

281
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,950
It's true. You're right.

282
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:05,050
How exciting, how exciting, so exciting!
Let's go!

283
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,030
The bus is getting close.

284
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,990
Yeah!

285
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,160
Let's go!

286
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,480
Let's go!

287
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,240
Sorry.

288
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,450
I didn't eat breakfast.

289
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,210
Oh, I have something to eat.

290
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,730
Really? Let's eat.

291
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,450
It's so cute!

292
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,520
How were they made?

293
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,650
What is this? What is it?
What, what?

294
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,770
Joon Woo, what is it? Me too.

295
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:44,090
Yeah, here. Ro Mi, take one.

296
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,270
Oh, me too. Huh?

297
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:49,030
Why are they the same?

298
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,160
It's the same.

299
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,820
Huh?

300
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,140
Take this.

301
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:58,940
What is it?

302
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,600
My part-time driver brought it for you.

303
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,380
Thank you.

304
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,010
Hey, this one looks good.

305
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:10,760
Eat this with your friends.
I made it yesterday.

306
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,470
It's been a while since the last time you made this.

307
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:14,300
Thank you.

308
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:29,620
VP and the President, take care of them.

309
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,600
- Go this way.
- I don't want to.

310
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,440
So this is where we're staying.

311
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,430
You came.

312
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:12,180
Don't go overboard.
I didn't come because of what you said.

313
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:15,130
Ridiculous punk.

314
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,120
Wow, it's so nice!

315
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:30,770
Wow.

316
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:33,240
It's not all that.

317
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,700
When will you wear all that?

318
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,320
I can wear them all.

319
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,640
Just make up.

320
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,220
He was walking on eggshells around you.

321
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,480
You should, if anything.

322
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,140
I didn't fight with him.

323
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,540
I didn't either.

324
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:58,840
Class 3, please come to the auditorium.

325
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,570
Begin!

326
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:06,050
Five people!

327
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:07,580
Five people! Five people!

328
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,670
Oh!

329
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:13,260
♬ For many of my days ♬

330
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,580
♬ I wish you would stay ♬

331
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,800
We lived!

332
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:21,910
♬ Even if the day is not significant ♬

333
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:26,360
♬ You, who soothed my feelings ♬

334
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:30,680
♬ and told me it's all rignt, ♬

335
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,520
♬ I really need you ♬

336
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,560
Begin!

337
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:41,230
♬ As much as the day's ending will not be sad ♬

338
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:48,650
♬ Today I will say you are appreciated ♬

339
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,890
Two people!

340
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:06,090
Two people, two people!

341
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,950
If you're by yourself, get out.

342
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:30,470
If you're by yourself, get out!

343
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:32,860
Yes.

344
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,960
What is this?

345
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,940
Hi.

346
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,350
Da Huin.

347
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:51,440
You were here.
I looked for you everywhere.

348
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,110
Jeong Oh Je. Give this to me.

349
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,340
It's totally my style.

350
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,400
How do you go around flirting with every single boy here?

351
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,620
What?

352
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,690
Da Huin.

353
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:12,860
Did you just hit me?

354
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,280
No, I was just—

355
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,090
Hey, Hwang Ro Mi!

356
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:19,390
This wench!

357
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:26,120
What's the matter?

358
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,390
Ro Mi!

359
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:36,100
Don't!

360
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,890
Wait, hold up!

361
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:42,250
Hit me instead! Ow!

362
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,920
Stop!

363
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,570
Get lost!

364
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:08,160
Guys, let's go have dinner.

365
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,150
I don't want to.

366
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:11,000
I don't want to.

367
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,750
Da Huin, open the door.

368
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,750
It's Oh Je.

369
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:28,530
Don't open it.

370
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,230
Da Huin.

371
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,740
Da Huin. I know you're in there.

372
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:40,690
What if he gets caught for being at the girls' dorm?

373
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,240
Da Huin.

374
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,160
Excuse me.

375
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,810
So Ye.

376
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:18,100
Soo Bin, should we go have dinner?

377
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,010
I'll carry it now.

378
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:25,570
You don't have to come tomorrow.
I'm going on a business trip to Japan.

379
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,320
Okay, travel safely.

380
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,740
Soo Bin's mom.

381
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:36,810
Why are you here?

382
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:39,280
I know Soo Bin went on a school trip.

383
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,610
What kind of woman is always the same no matter when?

384
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:45,390
Just cold and stiff. Seriously.

385
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:48,690
The keys!

386
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,220
Hello!

387
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,970
Hi!

388
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,410
I don't want a divorce. I won't.
How many times do I have to tell you?

389
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:11,220
You know how important this time is for Soo Bin.
Are you nuts?

390
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,120
Soo Bin will understand.

391
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,330
If I'm to go to the US next year,
I have to sort out our papers.

392
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:20,060
Why? Because you have to marry that wench?

393
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:23,450
Song Hui, let's stop criticizing now.

394
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:27,520
Pretending we're happy parents in front of Soo Bin,
acting like we're a loving couple in front of others.

395
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,920
I don't like doing that either.

396
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,500
Do you think I want to put on a show?

397
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,590
But a divorce isn't possible.

398
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:37,720
Until Soo Bin gets into college, I can't.

399
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,550
Stop using her as an excuse.

400
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:43,750
- Just beg me not to break up, if anything.
- What?

401
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:49,480
Pretending you're the best, like you're cool,

402
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,080
I'm sick and tired of it, really.

403
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,310
Beg for what? You think I still like you?

404
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:58,020
Now that you're living comfortably after the money
I earned to give us a good life?

405
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,350
You're the one who needs to... Seriously!

406
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:03,340
You're the one who should be more honest!

407
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:07,690
It's much nicer to live with a woman
who's less smart and less great.

408
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:11,170
So that's why you're leaving.
Be honest and say that. Please.

409
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:14,010
You know, so why ask? Huh?

410
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:18,200
Decide by next week.
If not, I'll sue you.

411
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,690
Why did you come?

412
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:59,010
Go in, Soo Bin's mom.

413
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,950
I'll do it.

414
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:07,850
Gwon Da Huin.
You're mistaken.

415
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:09,670
I have no interest in Ro Mi.

416
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:11,650
Then why did you look at her?

417
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:13,590
I didn't.

418
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:17,360
That hat earlier, she just took it from me.

419
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,620
She's always doing whatever she wants.

420
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:24,600
I'm being honest. I'm not interested in any other girl.

421
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,950
I'm the closest with you.

422
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:28,000
Really?

423
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,450
Then do you like me the best?

424
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:34,250
- Huh?
- I'm asking if you like me.

425
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,090
Oh, Teach! Teach.

426
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:44,970
We nearly got in trouble.

427
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,770
Da Huin.

428
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:55,830
Cute. I love you, Oh Je.

429
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:00,330
I know how lacking I am.

430
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:03,960
Following around Ma Hui Yeong
and watching my every move with him.

431
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,560
Mistaking that I could be just like him.

432
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:09,710
Gi Tae.

433
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:12,190
I am lacking,

434
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:18,130
really lacking, so I have no right to like you, but I do.

435
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,160
I really like you.

436
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,250
I really like you, So Ye.

437
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:27,410
But since you're being this cold to me,

438
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:30,780
it's so hard for me, So Ye.

439
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:36,390
Stand up. I said stand up.

440
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,600
I won't do it, So Ye.

441
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,360
According to each class,

442
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,920
sort out the items properly!

443
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,560
Class one!

444
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,400
That's right.

445
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,420
Ma Hui Yeong.

446
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:58,400
You're disappointed that I came back, right?

447
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,430
Whatever.

448
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:04,170
That can't be.
You must be really scared.

449
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,580
What?

450
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:11,060
I'm kidding.

451
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,100
Seriously, I'm so thankful to your father.

452
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:17,450
He promoted my dad and let me continue to stay on here.

453
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:21,750
He's an angel.
How can I pay him back?

454
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,470
Let's do well, friend.
Take good care of me.

455
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,330
Let's go.

456
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:41,960
Are you happy? Satisfied?

457
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:49,120
Would you be if you were me?

458
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,260
It's hard for Soo Bin...

459
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,590
Hui Yeong.

460
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,880
I'll help you.

461
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,460
You should have called me.

462
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,260
It's fine.

463
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,640
Come on!

464
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:45,250
Oh!

465
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,940
We have a summer home in Santa Monica.

466
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,430
Santa Monica? As expected.

467
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:53,100
It reminds me of having a barbecue party in the garden there.

468
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:57,420
You only ran your mouth there at the
Santa Monica summer home, too, didn't you?

469
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:00,060
Without lifting a finger?

470
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:04,720
Hwang Ro Mi, it turned out you're a total liar!

471
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,030
What? Your dad is the director of Jae Yeong Hospital?

472
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:11,620
Hey, come here.

473
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:16,060
Your father is the driver of that hospital's head!
How dare you pretend?

474
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:19,080
All of our team's moms nearly got fooled!

475
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:22,810
I knew it. You always made excuses
whenever there was a meeting with the parents.

476
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:25,450
You lied about your mom being a professor, too, didn't you?

477
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:27,990
Pil Sang, it's your chance.
Come on, go over there!

478
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:31,940
It's because it might embarrass Ro Mi.

479
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,970
What are you doing in our class?
Talk about it later.

480
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:39,010
- Let go. It's ridiculous when her dad's not even a doctor.
- Hey!

481
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,950
- He is a doctor.
- What?

482
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:46,400
My mom got treated by her father when she was sick last time.

483
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,130
How dare you make a scene after hearing crappy rumors?

484
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:52,300
Kwon Da Huin, did I ask you to help?

485
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:55,070
Fine, my dad's not a hospital director.

486
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:58,800
I lied a little. So what?

487
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,130
That I'm pretty and good in school, too,
just like her hospital director father,

488
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:05,610
saying that they're dying from envy, who said that?

489
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:06,420
Wasn't it you?

490
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,740
So who told you to lie?

491
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:12,090
Who told you to get fooled? It's the mistake
of the wench who got fooled.

492
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,410
Hwang Ro Mi!

493
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:17,350
Don't come.

494
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:32,810
You're up.
Have some porridge.

495
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,760
If you leave it, I'll eat it later.

496
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,300
- Okay.
- Thank you.

497
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,750
Then I'll leave.

498
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,390
Okay.

499
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,190
Yeon Woo.

500
00:38:56,190 --> 00:39:01,550
That is... you working for me, let's end it after today.

501
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:03,410
But your hand isn't even all healed yet.

502
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:06,580
I'll come for a few days more after
you return from your business trip.

503
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,800
I'll just take a cab.

504
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,630
I'm a little embarrassed to see you now.

505
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,160
What do you mean?

506
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,450
Let's just do that.

507
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,280
Now, next.

508
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:29,780
We'll start the truth hearing!

509
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:33,430
Then... drum roll.

510
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:40,190
Gi Tae Lee!

511
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,480
Take a seat.

512
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,400
Just throw your questions out, okay?

513
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,510
Then...

514
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:52,710
before dinner, you were absent for a moment.

515
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,660
Where did you go?

516
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:57,280
I went to speak to So Ye.

517
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:03,600
What did you talk about with So Ye?

518
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,490
I made a lot of mistakes, so...

519
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,060
What are you doing after coming all the way here?
Let's play together.

520
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,330
I'm okay. Call me when you need me.

521
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:24,350
I'll help you.

522
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,340
Should I do that then?

523
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:33,550
I need you now.

524
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:37,020
Without you, it's so not fun. That's why.

525
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,230
Just put this away. Let's go.

526
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,060
Let's go. Let's go.

527
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:44,200
Let's go and do a truth hearing, huh?

528
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:48,510
My most embarrassing moment in life was

529
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:58,180
in grade school during class, peeing my pants.

530
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,580
Fifth grade.

531
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,830
Do you have someone you love right now?

532
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:14,620
Wait, that doesn't count.
The answer's already known. Doesn't count.

533
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:20,330
Next. Hurry.

534
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:26,640
By chance, do you like someone you shouldn't?

535
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:38,680
Just, let's go to the next person.

536
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,670
Why? We have to hear it.

537
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:43,180
Never mind. Never mind. Next.

538
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:48,070
Now, Hwang Ro Mi!

539
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,230
Oh, Hwang Ro Mi.

540
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,020
No, I'll do it.

541
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:52,120
You go in!

542
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,610
This kid...

543
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:55,240
Fine, you—

544
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,570
I'll do it.

545
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:58,600
You do it.

546
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,370
Pil Sang, take a seat.

547
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:03,350
You go in.

548
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:09,980
You guys all saw earlier, right?
That I'm a huge liar.

549
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:15,570
I'm not worthy of playing this game, so I refuse it.

550
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:18,230
- Da Huin.
- I'll pick the next person.

551
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:21,090
- Yoo Soo Bin.
- You're next!

552
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:23,010
Yoo Soo Bin!

553
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:30,780
Do you still like Choi Joon Woo?

554
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:38,220
Straight forward! So fun!

555
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:40,360
Do you like him?

556
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,660
Please hurry up and tell us!

557
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:51,920
Then, there are no exceptions, so...

558
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:58,310
Five, four, three, two, one!

559
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:26,670
I ate so much today.

560
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,830
You're really a sociopath.

561
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:35,510
After getting humiliated?

562
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:38,970
Moon Chan Yeol, I can hear you.

563
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:41,160
I won't protect you next time.

564
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,330
Yeah right. Don't protect me.

565
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,830
- Why I—
- Hey, hey!

566
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:47,150
Don't, don't, don't!

567
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:49,150
Let's workout your legs.

568
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:51,720
She makes me so mad!

569
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:39,350
♬ I'm with you today ♬

570
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:44,040
♬ We're walking the roads we've walked together ♬

571
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:48,940
♬ With the things you like ♬

572
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:51,540
♬ I've tried decorating ♬

573
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,290
Soo Bin, sleep well.

574
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:57,320
♬ Dear my love ♬

575
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:03,030
♬ Let's just think of the times we loved ♬

576
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:07,610
♬ This night is passing by quickly ♬

577
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:11,310
♬ And I'm okay with that ♬

578
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:16,240
♬ Drawing your face in my head ♬

579
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,120
Pil Sang, don't do that.

580
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,330
Don't do that!

581
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:21,790
Who is it? Come in.

582
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:22,740
Come in dammit!

583
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:25,350
- Let's sleep.
- It's not me!

584
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:44,620
You can't sleep?

585
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:48,360
Why didn't you sleep?

586
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:51,480
Maybe it's because I left home.

587
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:58,560
Me too. I'm going crazy.

588
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,920
Ro Mi, are you crying?

589
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:14,620
Cry as much as you want.

590
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,980
I take back calling you a sociopath.

591
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:20,520
It's fun.

592
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:24,520
Eun Seo Jin or Eun Sae Jin or whatever their name is.

593
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,820
♬ For many of my days ♬

594
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:46,700
♬ I wish you would stay ♬

595
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:51,900
♬ Even if the day is not significant ♬

596
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:56,270
♬ You, who soothed my feelings ♬

597
00:46:56,270 --> 00:47:00,490
♬ and told me it's all rignt, ♬

598
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:06,130
♬ I really need you ♬

599
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:16,460
Now I will introduce our next performer,
the outsider from Year 2 Class 3,

600
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:20,040
Yoo Pil Sang. Applause!

601
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:33,600
Hello, I am Cheonbong's #1 most desired man, Yoo Pil Sang.

602
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,910
Today I will do a voice imitation act.

603
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:39,170
I'll try to do the principal.

604
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:40,460
Dong, let's go.

605
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:42,640
Yeah.

606
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,790
Are you nervous?

607
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:46,060
No, it's not that.

608
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,150
I feel like I have diarrhea.

609
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:51,620
What do we do?
You're up next.

610
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:54,650
Let's hold it in for a few more minutes.
You can do it.

611
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:55,990
You can do it. You can do it.

612
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:58,320
I can do it. I can do it. I—

613
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:59,730
I can't do it. I can't!

614
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:01,910
Hey, I don't think I can.
I really don't think I can.

615
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:04,190
It'll come out in the middle of me singing.

616
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:06,880
You sing a little right? You sing well?
You do? I hope you do.

617
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,360
I hope... you do well.

618
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:13,820
Go Dong?
Go Dong! Go Dong! Go Dong!

619
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:21,360
Now, for the next act we will have Go Dong take the stage!

620
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:24,800
Please give a round of applause!

621
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:31,580
Come on out! Hurry!

622
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:33,350
- Go Dong!
- Come out!

623
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:35,070
Is Go Dong not ready?

624
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:39,300
Hey, now Go Dong is coming...

625
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,360
Isn't that Choi Joon Woo?

626
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,490
It's not Go Dong.

627
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:43,360
Go Dong?

628
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,010
- It's Choi Joon Woo.
- Why?

629
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:46,590
Huh? It's Choi Joon Woo.

630
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:51,360
Then, instead of Go Dong,
we shall bring in Choi Joon Woo.

631
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,870
Now, a round of applause!

632
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:02,240
Why am I nervous?

633
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:06,220
Dance for us!

634
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:24,570
♬ From far away, from far away,
you are coming from far away ♬

635
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:38,040
♬ What should I say about this shaking heart? ♬

636
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:49,650
♬ You stole my heart from the beginning ♬

637
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:56,840
♬ You infected me with an incurable disease ♬

638
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:03,410
♬ You turned me into a flowerpot. Me. ♬

639
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:10,260
♬ I'm going to be the flowerpot on your small window sill ♬

640
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:17,130
♬ I can neither say anything nor hope for anything ♬

641
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:23,990
♬ If sometime I receive your smile and touch ♬

642
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:33,490
♬ Falling asleep I would see your face endlessly ♬

643
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:43,060
Excuse me. Checkered shirt.

644
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:44,390
Are you okay?

645
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:49,270
Don't you feel wronged, living
while not having a sense of presence?

646
00:50:57,850 --> 00:51:00,690
I like you too.

♬I'll be the flowerpt on your small windowsill ♬

648
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:14,370
♬ I can neither say anything nor hope for anything ♬

649
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:21,070
♬ If sometime I receive your smile and touch ♬

650
00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:30,640
♬ Falling asleep I would see your face endlessly ♬

Dancing in the Retro Night

652
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:53,590
Pil Sang, follow me.

653
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:13,690
If you haven't decided yet, you can tell me later.

654
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:16,350
No. I want to tell you now.

655
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:18,880
Yoo Pil Sang.

656
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,010
You are not my style.
Totally, you are not.

657
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:24,160
So wake up from your dream.

658
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,820
How can I...
What can I do to make you like me?

659
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:30,270
I'll try my best. I'll do everything.

660
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:31,820
Don't try.

661
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:35,360
Ten years, 20 years, 100 years...
Even if we met in our next life,

662
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:38,770
you will never be my boyfriend.

663
00:53:38,770 --> 00:53:41,400
Look for someone else.

664
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:03,110
- Gi Tae, let's stop.
- What?

665
00:54:09,970 --> 00:54:12,410
Let's break up.

666
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:14,540
What do you mean?

667
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:18,480
You won't change.

668
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,620
And I'll hate that.

669
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:30,020
Hui Yeong. Just once...
I'd like you to think about it really hard,

670
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:33,860
about what feelings you have for me.
Your true feelings.

671
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:39,010
Whether you did it because you really
like me or for some other reason.

672
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:41,650
It doesn't matter what feeling this is

673
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:47,090
The important thing is that
I can't have anything taken away from me

675

Joon Woo.

676
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:35,760
I'm sorry for not trusting you.

677
00:55:39,090 --> 00:55:42,360
Sorry for making you not trust me.

678

♬ Everywhere I go you are always there ♬

679
00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:55,930
Stay by my side.

680
00:55:55,930 --> 00:56:01,010
♬ And I was always scared to face the truth ♬

681
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:02,660
♬ Now I’m still ♬

682
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:05,160
♬ Waiting right here for you ♬

683
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:07,630
♬ to hold you in my arms again ♬

684

♬ Just like the days, ♬

685

♬ we were young and fumbling ♬

♬ Everything fades away ♬

687
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:24,490
♬ Let it go by with a flow ♬

688
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:28,000
♬ Really wish I could stay, ♬

689
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,560
♬ but you know me ♬

690
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:34,580
♬ All the moments we shared ♬

691
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:36,250
♬ Are not going anywhere ♬

Moment at Eighteen
~ Preview ~

693
00:56:38,850 --> 00:56:41,100
Everyone was happy right? Dismissed!

694
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:41,830
Shall we go?

695
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:43,720
I miss you every day.

696
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:46,420
I keep getting more curious about you

697
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:48,920
Don't worry about Joon Woo.
He's doing well.

698
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,720
I'll take care of him instead.

699
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:55,230
I'm doing well. I'm happy.

700
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:58,030
What changed after you started dating me?

701
00:56:58,030 --> 00:56:59,380
I keep looking in the mirror.

702
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:01,560
The me in there looks excited.

703
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:02,790
Pat, pat.

704
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:05,330
Soo Bin, I think it's a good idea
to take her out of the tutoring class.

705
00:57:05,330 --> 00:57:07,170
- Ma'am.
- Soo Bin's mother, what are you doing?

706
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:08,740
Is there something you did to make Hui Young mad?

707
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:13,130
I asked for you to be taken out because
I wasn't confident seeing you there

708
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:14,040
You're here?

709
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,490
♬ Everything fades away ♬

710
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:16,590
And you?

711
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:17,840
Hello, Ahjumma.

712
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,270
Even though we are friends,
I don't think this is right.

713
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:24,620
Come in and get some water from my house.
My mom is at work right now.

714
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:28,270
Hey, it's my mom. Come here.
♬ Are not going anywhere ♬

00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:34,590
