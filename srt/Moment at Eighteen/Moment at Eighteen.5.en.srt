1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,640
Because I find you intolerable.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,850
You were just making a big thing out
of nothing instead of disappearing quietly.

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,480
How dare you?

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,810
To me?

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,280
You should eat something.
Hey, what are you doing?

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,110
Hey, Joon Woo.

7
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,260
Stop him!

8
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,010
Joon Woo, stop.

9
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,980
Joon Woo, what's wrong?
Joon Woo!

10
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,730
Choi Joon Woo! Stop!

11
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:52,100
[Episode 5:
After that Long and Sad Day]

12
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,630
He really said that to you earlier?

13
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,080
But then, why did you hit Hui Yeong?

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,220
You said Gi Tae was the one who paid them.
Why did you hit Hui Yeong?

15
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,930
Because the one controlling Gi Tae is Ma Hui Yeong.

16
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,860
Hui Yeong?

17
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,240
Come on.
Why would Hui Yeong do that?

18
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,850
Hui Yeong.
Are you really okay?

19
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,900
You don't need to go to the hospital?

20
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,640
I'm okay.

21
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:36,070
But before, why did Joon Woo hit you?

22
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,810
Did something happen between you and him?

23
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:43,140
No. Joon Woo is probably mentally unstable right now.

24
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,180
I heard they were best friends since they were little kids.

25
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,010
I guess his emotions suddenly exploded.

26
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,200
It can happen.

27
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,880
You know those guys who came earlier
to pay their respects?

28
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,000
Did they say something?

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,830
Really? What did they say?

30
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,590
Oh, my math teacher called me.

31
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,220
Just a second.

32
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,520
Why isn't he picking up?

33
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,060
The person you have dialed is not available.

34
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,470
- You got a call.
- What?

35
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,520
It's my tutor. It's nothing serious.

36
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,490
Urgent. Tutoring apartment in 30 minutes.

37
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,990
So Ye, my tutor suddenly wants to start early today.

38
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,500
I think I have to leave first.

39
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,330
- Suddenly?
- I have to go. Sorry to leave first.

40
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,070
Practice well. I'll text you later.

41
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,070
Joon Woo, hang in there. Okay?

42
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,830
Let's talk again.

43
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,730
Okay.

44
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,490
Alright, go back in.

45
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:32,140
Joon Woo, I'll see you at school.

46
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,640
- Joon Woo must be going through a rough time.
- Yeah.

47
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,290
He's probably staying there until
his friend's family arrives.

48
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,710
Thank you all, guys.

49
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,750
Hui Yeong, are you okay?

50
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,100
Yes.

51
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:59,130
Joon Woo needs to pull himself together.
It's worrying.

52
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,000
Right?

53
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,530
Let's go.

54
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,510
It's weird.
Why is my heart acting like this?

55
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,970
It's prickly.

56
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:33,100
Jeong Woo, what should I do?

57
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,320
What...

58
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,290
should I do?

59
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:03,780
Gi Tae, did you give the guys money?
Are you crazy?

60
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,850
I couldn't help it.
If I hadn't paid them, they wouldn't have done it.

61
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,270
You told me to chase out Choi Joon Woo any way I could.

62
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,030
Choi Joon Woo's friend died.

63
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:18,440
If something goes wrong,
we could be blamed through a misunderstanding.

64
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,600
What are you talking about?
No... Why?

65
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,030
I don't know!

66
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,200
There must have been a traffic accident
on the way to work after he quit school.

67
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,930
What are you going to do when
they find out you gave them money?

68
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,560
Hui Yeong, you're the one who said that

69
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,340
if there was a problem you would
be responsible for everything.

70
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,730
It depends on what kind of problem.
Did I...

71
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,430
Did I tell you to pay them?

72
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,170
Ah, what...

73
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,470
What should I do?

74
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:58,450
- Then what am I supposed to do then?
- I don't know. To me...

75
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,620
So Ye.

76
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,470
What are you doing here?

77
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,110
So Ye.

78
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,260
Yoon So Ye!

79
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,990
Are you guys dating?
Does she know about us?

80
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,290
So Ye.

81
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:54,060
Did you follow me?

82
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,470
Why?

83
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:01,170
The rumors were true, Lee Gi Tae.

84
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,620
Ma Hui Yeong's minion.

85
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,730
So Ye, it's not like that.

86
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,640
How could you even do this?

87
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,660
I'm disappointed, Lee Gi Tae.

88
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,990
What's wrong with Yoon So Ye?
She's not answering my calls.

89
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,000
Yesterday, too, she kept on zoning out.

90
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,640
Seriously, what's her problem?

91
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,580
I'm here.

92
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:47,470
Was it okay? Are you okay?

93
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,760
What about Oh Je?

94
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,730
What about my Oh Je?

95
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,730
He's at the restaurant.

96
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:06,340
How is Choi Joon Woo doing?

97
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:14,930
Not well.
He was a close friend from the time they were little kids.

98
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,570
Hold on.

99
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,890
Soo Bin, today is Teacher Son Je Yeong's class.

100
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,700
Today, go with Hui Yeong.

101
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,330
Since the midterm exam is right around the corner,
I asked Hui Yeong precisely how he studied.

102
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:34,700
Hey, you're so lucky.
You are attending the academy together with Hui Yeong.

103
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,870
Yeah.

104
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,340
Did you find out?

105
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,970
Your score on Son Je Yeong's math level test.

106
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,910
Whether you passed or didn't.

107
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:50,770
There you go again. Hwang Ro Mi,
how can you be saying that in this situation?

108
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:58,100
- Are you curious?
- Yeah.

109
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,170
Pack your bag.

110
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:06,160
Stop attending? Why?

111
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,960
I was uncomfortable because you kept me
dangling saying you couldn't tell me my score on the level test

112
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,120
and studying alone is more comfortable.

113
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,940
To be saying that suddenly...

114
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,430
I'm sorry.

115
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,200
I came with a friend who wants to meet you.

116
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,820
Ro Mi.

117
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,370
Hello, I'm Soo Bin's friend Hwang Ro Mi.

118
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,100
I'm a close friend of Hui Yeong's.

119
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,060
Oh, I see.

120
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,330
Let me take the level test too.

121
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,970
Huh, what?

122
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,980
I'm trying to get you into Hui Yeong's math class.

123
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,710
Not everyone can take the level test for that class, you know?

124
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,450
- What is this?
- Hurry up.

125
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,320
You want to get into Teacher Son Je Yeong's class?

126
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,640
Yes! I asked the teacher

127
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,340
and he said he needs your permission.

128
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,780
No, you did well, Yoo Soo Bin.

129
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,680
Yoo Soo Bin, where are you going?
Did you come to find Hui Yeong?

130
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,830
Hui Yeong!

131
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,780
Soo Bin.

132
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,270
- Why are you so surprised?
- I'm not surprised.

133
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:38,170
- Let's go.
- I—

134
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,070
I'm not going to class anymore.

135
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,400
Why?

136
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,760
It's just a little icky.

137
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,610
For the time being, it's a secret from my mom.

138
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,090
Soo Bin.

139
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,990
I'm sorry.
I know you made an effort for me.

140
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,110
I hope you understand.

141
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,500
And...

142
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,320
never mind.

143
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,660
What?

144
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,650
What is it?

145
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,520
Earlier, when Choi Joon Woo was hitting you,

146
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,940
why did you just take it?

147
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,270
I...

148
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:27,000
felt like you were taking the hit on purpose.

149
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:33,020
Who gets hit on purpose?
I just couldn't dodge it.

150
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:38,890
But... why did you...

151
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,960
Huh?

152
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,630
It's nothing. You must have been shocked today, too,
so go home and rest.

153
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:50,760
I'll speak with teacher Son Jae Young well,
so make sure to come for the next class.

154
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,550
Got it?

155
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,830
Look at this, look at this!

156
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,700
Hello.

157
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:28,630
When I think about it,
it doesn't seem like you're dating Park Yeong Bae.

158
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:31,720
Do you have a crush on Park Yeong Bae?

159
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,220
Who's Park Yeong Bae?

160
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,360
Park Yeong Bae!
You know, the kid that works here.

161
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,320
Here, he's known as Park Yeong Bae.

162
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,520
Oh, Choi Joon Woo.

163
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,960
Kid, give up on him.

164
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,160
I have my eyes on Park Yeong Bae.

165
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,670
Give up, my foot.

166
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,060
It's not like that, Ahjumma!

167
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,180
A... ahju...

168
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,400
Hey! I was born in '98!

169
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:06,480
You should have a conscience
if your boyfriend is that good looking.

170
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:11,020
- Please give me some Sprite over here!
- Okay, give me one moment.

171
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,930
- Please give us two sets of the jeonbokja.
- Two jeonbokja (black bean abalone).

172
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:16,340
Dad, two sets of the jeonbokja.

173
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,400
Yes, sir!

174
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,200
Here.

175
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,500
Bye, noonas! You need to come back next time,
I'll be looking forward to it!

176
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,000
Goodbye.

177
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,500
Jeong Oh Je.

178
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,300
Kwon Da Huin.

179
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,330
Are you really going to be like this?
You keep ignoring me.

180
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,700
You don't call or pick up.

181
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:43,370
What boyfriend is like this?

182
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:46,720
I was busy today.

183
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,370
- I'm sorry.
- My son!

184
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,190
Yes!

185
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:52,080
- Here's the set!
- Father!

186
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,460
Nice to meet you!

187
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,820
Who...?

188
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,580
I'm Oh Je's girlfriend, Kwon Da Huin.

189
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:04,400
- Please take care of me.
- Girlfriend?

190
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,970
Our Oh Je had a girlfriend?

191
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:10,130
Of course! Today is our third day.

192
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,230
Should I serve this?

193
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:14,470
Oh yeah.

194
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,120
Jeong Oh Je.

195
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,160
Hope you enjoy.

196
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,760
You little punk,

197
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,270
you got a girlfriend and didn't tell your dad?

198
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,290
When you had such a pretty girlfriend?

199
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:34,290
- No.
- No, what?

200
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,900
- No, really.
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

201
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,580
Welcome!
Oh, you can sit over there!

202
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,400
Yeah, Joon Woo.
On your way home?

203
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,950
- Yes.
- Who is it?

204
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:57,930
You're Kwon Hyeok, right?
Why did you say that to Joon Woo?

205
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:01,000
That our class' kids gave you money.

206
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,170
I thought Choi Joon Woo would misunderstand.

207
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:09,110
Sin Jeong Woo didn't become like that because of us.

208
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:17,830
That he dropped out because we bullied him, that's true.

209
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,580
But it was because he got into
an accident on the way home from work.

210
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,890
And I'm in here because I caused some trouble already as it is.

211
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:27,120
If I take that blame for that too, it's the end of me!

212
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,370
Is it true that our kids gave you money?

213
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,690
I didn't even take the money.

214
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:38,620
Gi Tae, that kid, when we told him to give us some money,
he got scared and gave it to us.

215
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,140
Okay.

216
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:46,190
But the parts that you were to blame for,
I want you to testify to.

217
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,530
Please do that at least.

218
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:54,750
Can you say that, the way you saw it?

219
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,500
Yes.

220
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,130
Okay.

221
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,560
Thanks, Kwon Hyeok.

222
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,400
Okay.

223
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,910
Yeah, I got Kwon Hyeok's promise.

224
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,650
I also told the school.

225
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:21,300
We should all meet tomorrow to hear
the full story and talk about it.

226
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:26,620
I also feel like Gi Tae could've had his own
reasons that we don't know yet.

227
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,090
Don't be so upset, kiddo.

228
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,570
Okay.

229
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,950
Thank you.

230
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,660
You're thankful, right?
I told you, it'll work out!

231
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:41,420
The world is not as unjust as you think.

232
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,860
Let's change it together.

233
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,790
I'll see you tomorrow.

234
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,690
Okay, bye.

235
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:58,080
You said that. If there were a problem you
would be responsible for everything.

236
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:02,340
It depends on what kind of problem!
Did I... Did I tell you to pay them?

237
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:12,800
So Ye, please pick up your phone.

238
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,860
You surprised me!

239
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,730
I can't believe this.

240
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:35,700
Is that what they said?
That I told them to get you kicked out?

241
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,730
Not you.

242
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:41,000
It's Ma Hui Yeong's doing.

243
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:46,370
That's why Ma Hui Yeong probably tried to find you quickly.

244
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,130
It's true I gave them money.

245
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:52,720
Truthfully, my younger brother is a troublemaker.

246
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,890
He got into an argument with them while gaming

247
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,230
and got into a fight.

248
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:02,910
- I went to take care of that.
- Lee Gi Tae,

249
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,820
you know too, right?

250
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,540
From here, Ma Hui Yeong will escape

251
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,380
and you'll take all the blame.

252
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,290
Just tell the truth tomorrow, that Ma Hui Yeong ordered you.

253
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:22,500
I said Hui Yeong has nothing to do with this!
This is just, I...

254
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:38,710
Because of you guys, my friend died.

255
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:45,320
Just because you're protecting Ma Hui Yeong,
do you think he'll have your back?

256
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,920
The reason why you're so loyal to Hui Yeong,

257
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,100
isn't it so you'll go to a good college?

258
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:05,190
Lee Gi Tae, make a good decision.
Don't regret it later.

259
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,000
Joon Woo,

260
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,780
I'm sorry.

261
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:29,610
I'm sorry, Joon Woo.

262
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,590
I'm sorry, Joon Woo.

263
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:34,420
I'll kneel on my knees in front of you.

264
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,460
I, really, just once, can't you forgive me?

265
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,940
Huh?

266
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:43,500
Just once, can you overlook this?
I'm really sorry.

267
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,800
Once, please understand and forgive me.

268
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:51,940
Your life is already hopeless, but mine's not.

269
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,590
I've done well til now.

270
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:01,780
I did my best.

271
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:06,090
My mom and dad, they're living with all their hopes on me.

272
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:10,080
I'm the only one in my family that can go to college, Joon Woo.

273
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,140
Gi Tae,

274
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,950
there is no such thing as a hopeless life.

275
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,900
I'm only eighteen.

276
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,770
I, you,

277
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,400
and Jeong Woo.

278
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:06,000
I believe you have a conscience.

279
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:39,940
Don't worry.
I won't tell the others that you're dating Gi Tae.

280
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,960
I heard everything.

281
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,200
- What you and Gi Tae were talking about.
- What?

282
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,110
I won't tell the others either.

283
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:53,650
However, make sure that there's no problem with Gi Tae.

284
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,140
What problem?

285
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:58,150
If something happens to Gi Tae,

286
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:02,060
I won't just standby and watch.

287
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,800
My son, you're home?

288
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,000
My son, what happened to your face?

289
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,070
Who did this?

290
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,190
Are you okay?
Let's go to the hospital.

291
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:37,020
- We should get a diagnosis.
- Mom.

292
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,690
- Dad isn't home yet, right?
- No, Dad is going to be late.

293
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:45,130
And thank goodness for that. What is this?

294
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,900
- Let's go to the hospital first!
- Mom.

295
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,890
Help me.

296
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:03,040
Lee Gi Tae

297
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:44,600
Choi Joon Woo, you home?
Are you okay?

298
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:50,020
There's no way he's okay.

299
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,730
Mom.

300
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:13,140
I was so worried that I'm going to stay with you today.

301
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:24,440
Why's the house like this?
You should clean!

302
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,710
Look at this desk!

303
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:45,100
Choi Joon Woo! I bought two.

304
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,590
Mine came out like this.

305
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,500
It's good! It's good, right?

306
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,850
Joon Woo.

307
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,530
Joon Woo!

308
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:12,770
Mom, I'm going to go buy some water.

309
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,200
Joon Woo, we have water.

310
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,480
Ah, that kid.

311
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:33,970
- Choi Joon Woo is coming to school today, right?
- Probably?

312
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:37,010
Oh, he called our Oh Je yesterday,
asking about Gi Tae's house.

313
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,820
Da Huin,

314
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,980
good... good morning.

315
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,970
Why did Choi Joon Woo ask about Gi Tae's house?

316
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,770
Wow, the transfer student.

317
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:50,400
The transfer student made a mess
beyond what you guys could imagine.

318
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:54,660
How could he think of terrorizing Ma Hui Yeong?
I guess he gave up on his school life.

319
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,450
He must have lost his nerve.
(Literally, his liver came out of his abdomen)

320
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,560
Yoo Pil Sang, where'd you hear that?

321
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,050
I mean, just now, I was dragged by the gym teacher,

322
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:06,040
I eavesdropped like this, and the Vice Principal
was scolding Choi Joon Woo!

323
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,330
How could you hit Hui Yeong,

324
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:13,140
a friend who went to see you to comfort you.

325
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,910
Pil Sang,

326
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:17,140
- you're too noisy.
- She says you're too noisy.

327
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,710
Oh Je, is that what happened?

328
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:21,660
Is that why Hui Yeong didn't come?
Did he pass out?

329
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,190
No, it's not that bad.

330
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:25,120
What? You already knew about it.

331
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:28,800
- Gi Tae, they're calling you to the counseling room.
- Heol.

332
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,800
Why are they asking for Lee Gi Tae?

333
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,680
I got a feeling. A feeling.

334
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:38,180
Lee Gi Tae, Ma Hui Yeong, Choi Joon Woo,
in this triangle there must be a hidden big incident.

335
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:42,720
Hidden, what's there to be hidden?
It's just because Lee Gi Tae is the closest to Hui Yeong.

336
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,020
The closest is Soo Bin.

337
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,540
Pil Sang, go back to your seat.

338
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,210
Class President, this, this...
Did Choi Joon Woo really terrorize you?

339
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,370
What's this? It's not that serious.

340
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:52,830
- Hey, hey Pil Sang.
- What?

341
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:55,630
You totally restrained yourself.

342
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:59,740
Hey, Hui Yeong, is it true?

343
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:02,470
Is Choi Joon Woo a gangster?
Why would he punch me without a reason?

344
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,520
Let's be quiet and study.

345
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,750
Choi Joon Woo is a gangster.

346
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:17,720
Can't even call a gangster a gangster in this trashy world.

347
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,710
There, there, there's too much pride in that body.

348
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:22,280
Especially for someone who can't fight.

349
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,810
What in the world?

350
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:44,430
- Hui Yeong, are you okay?
- Yes.

351
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:47,710
I was so surprised this morning
after getting the call from your mother.

352
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,140
I'm okay, Vice-Principal.

353
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,390
Okay. Well, go in for now.

354
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:06,280
Since Teacher Oh Han Gyeol
is no longer the teacher of Grade 11, Class 3,

355
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:09,560
this meeting will be held among us only.

356
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:14,560
But I'm the one who submitted a report on this case and

357
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:19,440
visited the hospitalized students
as their substitute homeroom teacher.

358
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:21,730
Okay, good job.

359
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:27,140
But, the prior Class 3 teacher is going to return soon.

360
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,730
Don't you think it's polite to step aside? Then...

361
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:33,570
But even so I... Vice Principal!

362
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,440
Vice Principal?

363
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:01,000
It's getting long.
What is this?

364
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,740
Why is it taking so long?

365
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:23,960
Can you repeat what Yoon Geon Hyeok said to Choi Joon Woo?

366
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:30,480
Detective, apparently student Lee Gi Tae, gave them money.

367
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,110
Can you ask if it's true?

368
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:37,250
They said that Lee Gi Tae gave you guys money, is it true?

369
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,750
Student Yoon Geon Hyeok?

370
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:44,020
I never received money.

371
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:51,390
Is it true that you tried to get
Choi Joon Woo expelled from school

372
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:56,280
by getting him involved in a fight?

373
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:05,650
It's not true.

374
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:25,750
I apologize.

375
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:29,360
Exactly why...

376
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,630
My mom got everything sorted out.

377
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:51,620
Thanks.
Thanks, Hui Yeong.

378
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:54,100
Did you think I was really going to abandon you?

379
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:58,380
I was just really pissed off before.
You know me, right?

380
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,800
Of course, I do.

381
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,500
You're my most trusted friend.

382
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:19,610
I told you, it'll all work out!

383
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:23,290
The world is not as unfair as you think.

384
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:25,940
Let's make it right, together.

385
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:28,510
I'll see you tomorrow.

386
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:33,160
What is this?
Such an unexpectant voice.

387
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:07,680
Oh Han Gyeol, you stupid fool. Less than a kid, you idiot.

388
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:12,380
Are you, are you a teacher?
An adult?

389
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,290
You worthless...

390
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:16,940
What kind of teacher are you?

391
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:22,330
Joon Woo,

392
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:28,020
your best friend passed away,
so you must be very sad and angry.

393
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:32,960
Your actions that day were out
of stress you could not handle,

394
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,810
an act to protect yourself.

395
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:40,630
In such a situation, it is hard to control yourself

396
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:44,750
which can lead to an impulsive display
of violence and aggression.

397
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:47,130
It's something that can happen to anyone.

398
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:50,490
I've had a similar situation happen,

399
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:54,310
so I don't think that act of violence was you.

400
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:57,870
During adolescence...

401
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,290
Everything was handled well.

402
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,580
That's a relief.

403
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:24,090
It's good that it was all taken care
of without your dad knowing.

404
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:27,050
There must never be something like this again.
Do you understand?

405
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:29,820
- Do you understand?
- Yes,

406
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,890
Yes. I'm sorry, Mom.

407
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:44,650
How Could He Have Gone from an Ordinary Employee to a CEO?

408
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,790
Hui Yeong.

409
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,080
Teacher.

410
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,330
I heard the results of the meeting,

411
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:07,840
- that Joon Woo had a misunderstanding about you and Gi Tae.
- Yes.

412
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,990
It's a misunderstanding, right?

413
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:12,750
Of course.

414
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:16,330
Right, right. There's no way you'd lie!

415
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:19,020
Hui Yeong,

416
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:22,540
Teach is sorry.

417
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:28,630
Thinking about it, I think I was only trying
to take care of things from Joon Woo's side.

418
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:32,690
Must have been because Joon Woo's situation is unfortunate,

419
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:34,800
even though you are equally my student.

420
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,360
For doubting you for a second, I'll apologize.

421
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,750
It's okay, Joon Woo's the weaker side.

422
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,600
I understand defending the weaker side.

423
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,190
Thank you.

424
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,900
Weaker side.

425
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,890
Did you eat?

426
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:04,700
I really hope I should be sorry toward you.

427
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,860
Really.

428
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:13,680
Teacher, you must be relieved. How great is it?

429
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,360
Whether you're the homeroom teacher or just an assistant,
taking charge of a class is such a hassle.

430
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:23,740
That's not what I mean.

431
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:27,170
Teacher!

432
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:38,120
How could you tell me this right now?

433
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,460
Hey!

434
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,440
- No. No.
- Resignation Letter

435
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,280
T-T-Teacher Oh!
Give me one second.

436
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,600
Hold on. No. Just a second.

437
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,540
Teach— Teacher Oh!

438
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,890
Teacher Oh.

439
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,520
What did she say?

440
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,770
As a means of self-defense,
Joon Woo acted violently out of anger.

441
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:02,670
The teacher said that?

442
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:06,280
Well, that's what the people say.

443
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:09,120
I don't know, she said so many difficult things.

444
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:13,860
What about Choi Joon Woo?
Didn't he get mad and throw stuff around?

445
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,780
"Just do whatever you want."
That's what he apparently said.

446
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:22,060
If he completely gave up.

447
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:26,060
What is he going to do now?
He totally got on the wrong side of the teachers.

448
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:31,000
Our Oh Je said Choi Joon Woo's a good kid.

449
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,260
If he completely gave up.

450
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:37,330
- Where are you going?
- Where are you going?

451
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,320
If you're going to ask if I'm okay, don't.
I'm not okay.

452
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:05,060
I'm not here to ask you that.

453
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:14,530
You have something with Hui Yeong, right?
That's why, at the funeral,

454
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:17,500
you hit Hui Yeong like that.

455
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:21,430
I guess I was like that in front of Ma Hui Yeong?

456
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,900
And Ma Hui Yeong's girlfriend.

457
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:30,830
How could you say it like that?

458
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:34,360
I... even if I can't be a big help,

459
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,360
I wanted to help you if something unfair happened.

460
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,970
Why would you help me?

461
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:42,390
Out of pity?

462
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:46,770
Because of my forced transfer?
Getting sucked into a bad situation?

463
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,540
And my one and only friend that died?

464
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:54,430
- What pity?
- No need.

465
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:58,190
Even if I don't get pity from people
like you who grew up graciously,

466
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:01,240
I lived a good life.

467
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:09,040
The anger that I've suppressed so well til now,
why am I releasing it on her?

468
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:14,020
Truthfully,

469
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:17,750
I just wanted to come to you.

470
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,930
I don't know the reason why.

471
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:25,460
If I made you angrier, I'm sorry.

472
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,770
Wow, my, dynamite news!

473
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:58,120
Oh Han Gyeol quit.

474
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,680
What? Really? Really?

475
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,090
Why? Seriously?

476
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:06,500
Yeah. They say he quit.

477
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,820
All of a sudden?

478
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,590
Pil Sang, let's sit down.

479
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:11,410
Class President.

480
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:14,890
- Did Teacher Han Gyeol really quit?
- Yeah,

481
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:18,190
I'm not sure of the details, but
I think something came up for him.

482
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:21,700
Our homeroom teacher was
admitted to the hospital again, due to his illness.

483
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:25,120
Until another teacher comes,
I think we need to be by ourselves.

484
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,690
- Next week is midterms, right?
- I knew something didn’t feel right.

485
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:30,820
I’ll post which chapters will be
on the exam on our online community.

486
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:34,920
Also, I'll upload a summary
of each subject so you can use it.

487
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,530
- Wow. Thanks!
- You're the best!

488
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:40,170
Thanks!

489
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:41,700
I love you!

490
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,160
I don’t need it.

491
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,360
I hope everyone's grades go up this time.

492
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,400
The summary is to only be shared within our class.

493
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:52,270
Of course.
Even if we share it out of friendship, it works against us.

494
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:54,970
That’s right.

495
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:56,270
Teacher Oh!

496
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:58,840
Teach, what's going on?

497
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,670
F-Finish up.

498
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,950
Oh, I'm finished now.
You can greet them.

499
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:04,720
Ah, Teach, what is it?

500
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,700
Teach, are you really quitting?
That's unfair!

501
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:10,210
Teach, can't you stay at least until
the homeroom teacher comes back?

502
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:13,420
- Stay till then at least, please!
- That's right!

503
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:16,290
Please stay!

504
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:19,680
Hey, if you guys are like this, how would Teach feel?

505
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,310
Let's let him go peacefully.
Thank you for your work til now, Teach.

506
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:25,600
Please leave us with some good words.

507
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,250
Oh yeah, um.

508
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:31,470
Uh, what I want to say is...

509
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:36,770
Joon Woo?
You're leaving?

510
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:41,190
I don't think we need to hear it.
You're not our teacher anymore.

511
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:44,440
Joon Woo.

512
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,290
You,

513
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:49,360
why don't you listen first, huh?

514
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:55,700
It's not the last time.

515
00:41:55,700 --> 00:42:00,040
I mean, I, I was planning to just quit,

516
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,360
but I changed my mind.

517
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:06,900
Since I've gotten close to you guys, and also, um...

518
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,590
Also...

519
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:12,410
it's hard to find a job these days! Huh?

520
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:15,590
This is the most secure job.

521
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:19,920
- That’s his true self.
- I can’t believe we fell for it.

522
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,460
And also one more thing,

523
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:26,560
from this moment on,

524
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:32,240
Grade 11, Class 3's official homeroom teacher is

525
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:36,930
Oh Han Gyeol. Please take care of me!

526
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,370
Teach.

527
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:41,870
Really, really?
Did you become our real homeroom teacher?

528
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:45,130
Was I a fake before then?

529
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:11,580
Yes, Teach!

530
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,550
Wait, Teacher Oh!
Teacher Oh Han Gyeol!

531
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:16,150
Wait, wait a minute!

532
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:19,750
I said, wait—

533
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:23,250
Take your hands off me is what you said,

534
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:26,520
so I'm taking my hands off, taking everything off.

535
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,330
Wait, wait.

536
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:31,570
At least until we get a temp to fill in.

537
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:36,250
Class 3's homeroom teacher
got admitted to the hospital again,

538
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:38,370
so what can we do?

539
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,300
Okay, I'm sorry. I'll apologize.

540
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,370
I'm also sorry. I apologize.

541
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:45,740
Teacher Oh!

542
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:50,360
Until we get a homeroom teacher, be a substitute, okay?

543
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,210
No, I won't be a substitute.

544
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:55,640
Teacher Oh!

545
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:59,980
Homeroom teacher!
I want to be that.

546
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,210
You're being loud.

547
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:12,760
Hui Yeong, Gi Tae.

548
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:20,400
From now, since I'm the homeroom teacher,
I wanted to make things clear.

549
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,440
I will keep watching you.

550
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,450
You know what that means, right?

551
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:37,130
Yes.

552
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:43,530
Okay. Let's get along, Hui Yeong.

553
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:00,520
Joon Woo.

554
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,360
Are you going to your part-time job?

555
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:06,940
You're working hard.
There's not much time till the exams either.

556
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:12,510
Gi Tae, are you satisfied now

557
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:15,120
that your life isn't ruined?

558
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:19,300
- What does that mean?
- What's that, out of the blue, Punk?

559
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,150
Let's go.

560
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:33,550
Oh, Joon Woo!

561
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:53,030
We sent off Jeong Woo well.

562
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:59,280
Sin Jeong Woo, that punk, he was thankful for you guys.

563
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:03,560
That you guys ate with him and all.

564
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:11,790
For kids like us, eating is really important.

565
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:16,300
He and I both, we just grew up.

566
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:22,020
We just lived like specks of dust flying around aimlessly.

567
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:28,050
I'll go in now.

568
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:30,060
Lim Kwon Hyeok

569
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,540
Take care.

570
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:53,930
Joon Woo, did you meet well with Kwon Hyeok?

571
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:55,730
Yes.

572
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:58,300
It was a good decision to see him, right?

573
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,620
You didn't believe me, didn't you?

574
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:09,810
Last time, when I called you all excited.

575
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:13,390
Ah, so embarrassing.

576
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:16,160
Why? That's your charm.

577
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,400
Being bright.

578
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,960
Heol! You, after that point, I have a goal now.

579
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:26,390
A teacher that Choi Joon Woo will believe!

580
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:29,740
I believe in you, Teach.

581
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:31,450
Believe, my ass.

582
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:33,080
You have it written here,

583
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,530
Oh Han Gyeol, credibility, zero percent.

584
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:38,480
Don't touch my hair, please. Style.

585
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,460
Style.

586
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:45,860
It's written here too! Credibility, zero percent.
Telling the teacher to do this or that.

587
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,090
Thank you, for coming with me.

588
00:47:56,190 --> 00:48:00,870
Joon Woo. From now on, forget everything,

589
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:04,610
and let's do our best together again.

590
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:08,730
Let's put aside depression, self-blame, things like that

591
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,360
Okay.

592
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:16,060
When I said I was quitting earlier,
your heart dropped, right?

593
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,190
No.

594
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:21,860
You had tears in your eyes.

595
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:25,160
Did you not?

596
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:45,090
I washed it. Thanks.

597
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:49,410
Actually, I just wanted to come see you.

598
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:13,820
It's not, it's not.

599
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:16,420
Are you finished?

600
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,790
Why are you helping me?
Out of pity?

601
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:19,470
Yoo Soo Bin.

602
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,860
I'm sorry.

603
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:39,100
I'll help you.

604
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:41,160
- No, it's okay.
- No, give it.

605
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:55,410
Guys, this is supplemental reading for social studies.

606
00:50:55,410 --> 00:51:00,570
Take the notes on your own, and pass these back.

607
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:15,370
There's not that much time till the exams.

608
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:20,440
To make exam preparations more efficient,
we'll change our seats. Everyone, look at the group message.

609
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:28,470
What, my, what's this?

610
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:31,510
All the trashy kids that can't study are in the back.

611
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:32,980
It's not like that.

612
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:35,830
It looks like that because we grouped it by study groups.

613
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:36,830
That's that.

614
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:40,640
People who were in the same class as me
in Grade 10 will know how helpful this is.

615
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:46,160
That's right.
That time, everyone's grades went up a lot.

616
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,130
Let's move.

617
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:52,230
Class President, must we do this?

618
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:57,070
Our class voted early this semester
to follow my decisions regarding seating arrangements.

619
00:51:57,070 --> 00:51:58,580
I hope you'll follow it.

620
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:01,590
Yes, understood.

621
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:04,590
Did everyone agree to changing seats?

622
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:08,530
Soo Bin, Me, Chan Yeol,

623
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:13,070
all the kids I know were against it,
but the majority still agreed.

624
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:17,720
If we do seats like that, well,
they look over each other's studying

625
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:20,510
so all the smart kids were for it.

626
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:29,710
Okay, let's settle down now.

627
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:40,350
- What happened to the seating?
- It's midterms.

628
00:52:40,350 --> 00:52:42,220
We switched seats.

629
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:46,840
Ahh, without discussing it with the teacher?
I'm the teacher.

630
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:49,480
We just did it freely among ourselves.

631
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,730
We did it like this last year too.

632
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:54,660
Ah, I see.

633
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,440
Oh, we said we have English Supplementary class, right?

634
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,890
In 20 minutes, we'll start it here.

635
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:06,490
Teach, we can't participate in a supplementary class.
We have a study group.

636
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:10,130
You're not going to go to class because you need to study?

637
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:12,160
It's not a core class.

638
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,680
Oh, not a core class.

639
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:20,450
Okay, then, those who are not going
to take the supplementary class.

640
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:26,070
- Are you part of Hui Yeong's study?
- No.

641
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:29,230
- 'We have our own way to go.'
- Me too.

642
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:30,720
Put your hand down.

643
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:35,490
Teacher! We'll take your class.

644
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:37,430
- Me too!
- Me too!

645
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:39,950
Me too!

646
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:42,170
Ah, okay.

647
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:51,640
Joon...

648
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:56,100
Joon Woo seems not to have
any interest in studying, don't you think?

649
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:04,570
Teacher, I cannot yield to you on this.

650
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:07,080
Our grades depend on this.

651
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:10,540
Yield?

652
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:14,750
Do you go to school so that you can make concessions to me?

653
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:17,430
I didn't mean it like that.

654
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:24,100
Then does it mean you made a concession to accept
a pitiful person like me as your homeroom teacher?

655
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:29,750
If I lash back at you like this, it would
be like admitting that my ego has hit rock bottom.

656
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:39,410
The seats, let's put them back the way they were.

657
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:44,460
And make it so that your study group
doesn't clash with my class.

658
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:03,100
God, Buddha, and Maternal Grandma,

659
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:06,650
I think I need to have a religion.

660
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:11,220
Teach Oh, how about you raise an opposing leader?

661
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:32,740
Thank you.

662
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:35,190
Here you go.

663
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:41,690
Joon Woo.

664
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:46,270
I'm also going to join the study.

665
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:54,800
What should we do?
Only kids who are above average are in this study.

666
00:55:54,800 --> 00:56:00,150
Oh, if you need help studying,
I'll help you one-on-one later.

667
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:02,920
Joon Woo, you're so lucky.

668
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:09,600
Above average.
Do I not look like that?

669
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,970
Based on what?

670
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:17,380
Ah, if you were offended, sorry.

671
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:19,770
Then let's do it together.

672
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:23,360
Since it's your first time, the front seat will be good.

673
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,780
Ah, no good.

674
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:30,330
I need to go to my part-time job.

675
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:33,760
Sorry for disrupting you.

676
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:38,340
Bye, Joon Woo.

677
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:40,690
But...

678
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:45,310
Why do you do things like this?

679
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:46,320
What?

680
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,750
Aren't you busy enough studying by yourself

681
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:50,950
to keep the first position?

682
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:55,160
Oh, that...

683
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:59,360
Hui Yeong is like that. He helps us and

684
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:05,830
"let's all do well together," that kind of mindset?

685
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:07,670
Oh, really?

686
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:11,320
Oh...

687
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:15,730
you live hard.

688
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:41,120
As you can see, gerunds and present participles

689
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:45,420
can be distinguished by a verb plus “ing”—

690
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:49,720
- Hello.
- Yes?

691
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,600
Excuse me. Can I see Soo Bin?

692
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:52,710
Hello.

693
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:54,870
Hello. Hello.

694
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:57,180
- Soo Bin?
- Yes, what's the issue?

695
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:58,790
It's something urgent.

696
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:00,640
Continue with the lesson.

697
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:15,360
You, did you stop going to Teacher Son Jae Yeong's class?

698
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:18,950
Are you crazy?

699
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:21,650
Follow me.

700
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:36,970
Hey Yoo Soo Bin, are you out of your mind?
Crazy? Huh?

701
00:58:36,970 --> 00:58:41,870
Don’t you know how much I kissed up to Hui Yeong’s mom?
Didn’t you see me acting like a servant around her?

702
00:58:41,870 --> 00:58:47,020
But without discussing with me, you just stopped
going to the class? Why, why, why, why, why?

703
00:58:47,070 --> 00:58:49,830
Even so, how could you barge into my class like this?
It's embarrassing.

704
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:51,960
Embarrassed? Embarrassed??

705
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:54,620
Who should be the one saying that?
You're embarrassed by me? I'm embarrassed by you.

706
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:57,170
I'm so embarrassed by you, I can't go out to my reunion.

707
00:58:57,170 --> 00:59:00,250
My friends’ children all attend science, private,
and foreign language high schools.

708
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:03,220
At least they come in first place at regular high schools.

709
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:05,780
They'll have no trouble getting into Seoul University.
But what about you?

710
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:07,750
Do you have anything to be proud of?

711
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:11,370
I'm giving blood, sweat,
and tears to get you into Seoul University.

712
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:14,320
Why are you doing this?

713
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:17,740
Did you get married to go to your college reunion?

714
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:20,790
Did you have me so you can brag about me?

715
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:22,930
Then, if you are doing that, abandon me now

716
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:26,150
and adopt someone who is good at studying.
Why are you bothering me?

717
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:28,190
What? What did you say?

718
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:31,100
Are you done?
Keep talking, keep talking.

719
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,680
Keep going, you brat.

720
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:34,860
I can't go to Seoul University.

721
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:37,420
Even if you bring someone better than Son Jae Yeong,

722
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:39,910
I can't go. Even if I die, I can't go.

723
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:42,680
I think even getting into a college in Seoul is amazing enough.

724
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,430
I'm doing fine like this right now.

725
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:48,820
If you’re such a smart mom and graduated
from Seoul University, why can’t you see that?

726
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:50,780
Go, do whatever you want.

727
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:52,520
Go! Go! Go and live as you want!

728
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,230
Get out of the house, brat!

729
00:59:54,230 --> 00:59:57,440
I don't need a daughter like you!
Don't need a daughter like you, go!

730
00:59:58,390 --> 01:00:00,920
Do you think I can't leave if you tell me to leave?

731
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:03,680
Thank you, for letting me live how I want!

732
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,070
Hey hey! Come back! Hey.

733
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:07,990
Hey, hey, Yoo Soo Bin, aren't you coming back here?

734
01:00:07,990 --> 01:00:10,990
Hey Yoo Soo Bin, come back here! Hey!!

735
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:57,900
So what is the function of a present participle, Moon Chan Yeol?

736
01:00:57,900 --> 01:00:59,600
Yes.

737
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:02,170
You really know nothing...

738
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:07,450
Oh, Soo Bin.
Are you okay?

739
01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:09,610
Yes. I'm sorry.

740
01:01:09,610 --> 01:01:13,570
Teacher, can I leave early?

741
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:16,920
Oh, okay. Do that.

742
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:25,830
Okay, see you tomorrow.

743
01:01:25,830 --> 01:01:28,890
Soo Bin, I'll call you

744
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:06,500
Just go. I'm not in the mood to argue with you.

745
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:18,690
High School

746
01:02:19,890 --> 01:02:21,880
Go.

747
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:25,260
I am going.

748
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:31,460
Are you okay?

749
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:40,760
Isn't, "Are you okay?" my line?

750
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:44,900
Ah, you're right.

751
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:50,380
Can't I also use it?

752
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:54,880
I'm worried.

753
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:59,470
I saw your mom come in earlier.

754
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,560
I wasn't trying to see on purpose.

755
01:03:07,130 --> 01:03:09,830
If you saw, then you know.

756
01:03:09,830 --> 01:03:12,530
I also was not raised that graciously.

757
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:16,120
You're not the only one who grew up having a hard time.

758
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:19,760
You're right.

759
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,990
Uhh.

760
01:03:35,690 --> 01:03:37,800
About yesterday, I'm sorr—

761
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:40,390
Can you leave now?

762
01:03:40,390 --> 01:03:42,180
Huh?

763
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:46,180
I want to be alone.

764
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:14,050
But...

765
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:17,290
How can you not know how to apologize?

766
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,230
That's why I was about to apologize just now.

767
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:26,630
And, I'm not Ma Hui Yeong's girlfriend.

768
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:35,250
Why am I like this to you?

769
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:38,210
Out of pity?

770
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:44,810
I know it's not, so now I'm—

771
01:04:44,850 --> 01:04:46,590
It's because I like you!

772
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:50,730
What are... you going to do?

773
01:05:10,830 --> 01:05:11,580
Choi Joon Woo!

774
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:15,320
♬ The day the small door opens ♬

775
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:20,630
♬ And the world is different ♬

776
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:24,360
♬ That type of happiness is my all ♬

777
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:30,020
♬ It's stunningly brilliant ♬

778
01:05:30,020 --> 01:05:31,750
♬ It makes the hand I lent sad ♬

779
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:34,690
Moment at Eighteen
~ Preview ~

780
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:38,590
Do you really?

781
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:43,180
Yoo Soo Bin. Soo Bin.

782
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:46,390
I'm not going home today.

783
01:05:46,390 --> 01:05:48,930
-The night streets are dangerous.
- Soo Bin is at Chan Yeol's house.

784
01:05:48,990 --> 01:05:52,220
I had something to ask regarding the class students.

785
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:54,340
That day, what was the situation then?

786
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:55,910
That punk has done this a few times before.

787
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:59,010
I'm never going to let Ma Hui Yeong be first here.

788
01:05:59,010 --> 01:06:02,290
You had this type of illness: Jealousy, Anxiety.

789
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:03,550
Do you want to humiliate me?

790
01:06:03,550 --> 01:06:07,460
I’ll make you feel sorry for those you looked down on.

791
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:10,860
Soo Bin.

792
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:12,520
Teach, I'll take her.

793
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:17,970
♬ The day the small door opens ♬

794
01:06:18,010 --> 01:06:21,280
♬ And the world is different ♬
