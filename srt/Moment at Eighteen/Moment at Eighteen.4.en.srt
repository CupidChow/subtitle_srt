1
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,200
It was in my pocket.

2
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,960
It's clean. It's just wrinkled.

3
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,490
That's totally unexpected.
Carrying this around.

4
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:40,530
The more you live alone, you have to carry around
things like this, my mom told me.

5
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,600
If you carry it around like this, it makes you look worse.
You should keep it well pressed.

6
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:52,650
No. Usually, I keep it well pressed,
but my mom took the iron with her.

7
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,550
She's working outside of Seoul.

8
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:04,470
No wonder. Every day your school uniform
and everything you wear is wrinkled.

9
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,870
It was because you don't have an iron.

10
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:12,850
It's not that bad.
I was told I looked okay.

11
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,200
Who did?

12
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,630
The kids. Kids.
Girls.

13
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:28,490
Heol. Wow.
While pretending not to hear what was being said

14
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:32,740
and pretending to be disinterested,
you have been totally enjoying what the girls said.

15
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:37,930
N-No. That's not so.
I didn't intend to listen,

16
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:42,740
but I was passing by and their voices are all so loud.

17
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,130
So that's what ...

18
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:01,080
- Why aren't you asking?
- Huh?

19
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:07,880
Either what happened or why am I walking around like this?

20
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,960
Why aren't you asking?

21
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,050
Why I'm in this state?

22
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,670
You must have been in a fight again.
Somewhere.

23
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:31,190
Again?
I'm not the type of guy who gets into fights.

24
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:36,270
If it's not a fight, was it an exercise or playing a game?

25
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:43,900
A type of a... single-round?

26
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:49,670
- You don't mean getting hit?
- What do you think I am?

27
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:54,450
I can't tell you the details right now.

28
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,770
Aren't you answering the phone?

29
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,490
Oh, right!

30
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,130
- Yes?
- Hey, where are you?

31
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,380
Hey, how could you forget to go to your part-time job?

32
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,140
I had an emergency.

33
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,550
Hey! Why am I going, too?

34
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:55,680
- It's too far to walk. And it might rain again. Hold on tight.
- Okay.

35
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,420
Why didn't you finish the paper you wrote?

36
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,920
What comes after "not because I'm afraid of ghosts"?

37
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,500
Hey, you aren't going to answer?

44
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,960
- Hello.
- What's up with you two?

45
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,470
Hey, Park Young Bae?
Where were you slacking off and...

46
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,710
What's the matter with your face?
Who did this to you?

47
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,410
- Did you do it?
- Pardon?

48
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,260
No.
That... While riding the bicycle.

49
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,620
- Together?
- No.

50
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,640
You two... are dating, right?

51
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,050
- No.
- No.

52
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,560
- Soo Bin.
- Oh, Hui Yeong.

53
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,020
Where did you go?
Your mom was really worried.

54
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,970
You went to my house?

55
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:39,110
- To go to the academy together. Congratulations on being accepted.
- Oh. Yeah.

56
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:44,390
- We're going right away?
- Of course, we have to get started right away.

57
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:50,520
- Joon Woo, you fought again?
- Right? Right?

58
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,030
If you're going through something difficult,
tell me anytime.

59
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,220
Why?

60
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:03,720
Since we're in the same class.
Wouldn't it be better to help each other solve things?

61
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,310
Not sure. I don't want to.

62
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:18,300
- Whatever you're comfortable with. See you tomorrow. Let's go, Soo Bin.
- Yeah, let's go.

63
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:29,330
Choi Joon Woo, make sure you send me
the last part of your paper!

64
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,500
Park Young Bae, those kids are dating, right?

65
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,790
No.

66
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:45,930
What do you mean no?
That little girl is so lucky!

67
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,640
Hey, hurry up and change your clothes.
Got it?

68
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:03,590
Yeah. I didn't get rained on that much.

69
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:08,420
Just... well, I wandered around here and there.

70
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,050
Yeah, Mom.

71
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,750
I brought clothes.
Change into them.

72
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,530
Why is my mom making you do things like this?

73
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:37,340
I asked her to give them to me since
she was worried that you might have gotten rained on.

74
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:41,810
- Not sure where you can change.
- No, never mind. It's okay.

75
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:46,410
Change.
What if you get a cold?

76
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,540
This. Here.

77
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,600
It's all dry, right?
I don't need to change.

78
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:07,800
But Hui Yeong, don't do this next time.
It's a little burdensome.

79
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:12,790
What burden?
I did it because I wanted to.

80
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:20,930
We're going to be late.
Let's go, Ma Hui Yeong kiddo. Come on.

81
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:26,430
Choi Joon Woo

82
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:53,920
Why aren't you sending me the ending?

83
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:04,960
Also, the thing you wrote for me this morning,
send it to me as an English composition.

84
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,940
I won't say anything even if it's bad for now.
That's the only way it'll help you study.

85
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,200
It'll help you study?

86
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,660
I see.
You're at the top level in English, huh?

87
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:30,000
Now, this is how the law of sines can be demonstrated
to be valid whether it is a right, acute, or obtuse angle.

88
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:38,140
So the formula for the value of the sine of an angle is equal to the length of the side opposite the angle divided by the hypotenuse.

89
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:43,770
Now, let's apply this right away.
Who can we have solve this problem?

90
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,870
How about Hui Yeong?

91
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:56,000
- Yes.
- Why are you distracted? What's the matter today?

92
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,870
Teach, it seems that Ma Hui Yeong can't concentrate
due to his girlfriend making her appearance here today.

93
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:06,350
Aigoo, it's big trouble.

94
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,100
That shouldn't be happening.
What should we do?

95
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:16,270
Teach!
Instead, I, who don't have an iota of a girlfriend

96
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:20,420
- will solve it.
- Okay. Go ahead and solve it.

97
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,370
Also, why do you think you don't have a girlfriend?

98
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:27,370
Hey, Hwang Ro Mi, Yoo Soo Bin comes to our academy.

99
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:32,140
I'm home.

100
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:48,930
I'm here.

101
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,510
Okay.

102
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:58,280
It went well?
You got a good lesson?

103
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,310
It was okay.

104
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:04,230
Mom, is anything the matter here?
Does it hurt?

105
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,950
I got hurt while running after you.

106
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:17,710
I'm sorry. I just...
Because of the way you were with Hui Yeong's mom,

107
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,090
I got a little upset.

108
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:28,170
Soo Bin, I know, too, that I bother you incessantly.

109
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:34,680
I know, too, that I shouldn't do that.
I try not to, but it's not working out well.

110
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:41,440
The only child I have,
my girl whom I love the most in the world.

111
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:48,380
What if you get mistreated by going to a less reputable school?

112
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:53,710
What if she doesn't meet a good husband?
What if she can't live in Gangnam?

113
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:59,300
What if she lives a hard life?
That's how I think.

114
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,650
Mom.
Sleep comfortably.

115
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:10,360
This is why your shoulder always gets numb.

116
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:17,370
I'll study hard.
Don't worry so much.

117
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:31,400
That was worth me getting hurt.

118
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,900
Composed. Please revise.

119
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,500
The last part, I'm still thinking about.

120
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:22,500
Wow. Oh, this is very serious.
What are we going to do with him?

121
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:29,260
But still, he put in a lot of effort.

122
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:42,140
It's not too bad comparatively.
I revised a few things.

123
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:47,510
This is a "few things"?
Oh, it's so embarrassing.

124
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:53,620
Memorize all this, and let's go over it tomorrow.
You can't sleep until you do.

125
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:10,870
I thought as much. That's why your uniform
and everything you wear is always so wrinkled.

126
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:13,810
It was because you didn't have an iron?

127
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,530
How to iron without an iron

128
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,340
It was in my pocket.

129
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,120
What's your dream?

130
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:27,980
Some people say... Ghost...

131
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:35,330
- Yeah, Mom!
- Good morning, Son!

132
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,520
- Oh, you're washing?
- My eyes are stinging. Hurry.

133
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,160
- Yeah, Joon Woo. Make sure you eat breakfast and--
- Yeah, breakfast. Uh-huh.

134
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,780
- And make sure you dress tidy, and the handkerchief--
- Yeah, the handkerchief? Okay.

135
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:49,510
- Mom, my eyes are stinging, hurry.
- Okay, my baby. I love you.

136
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:53,910
- Okay, bye. Okay.
- Okay!

137
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,540
Jeong Woo, are you okay?

138
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:26,090
The call cannot be completed, so you will be...

139
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,620
Hello.

140
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:47,740
Joon Woo.
Choi Joon Woo, come here.

141
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:51,280
Choi... Hey!

142
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:10,750
You didn't know the requirements, did you?
What's with your mask?

143
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:17,900
Wow, you're a good actor.
It's not like you're an idol or something. Come here.

144
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,920
Stand still. Take it off.

145
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,010
What's the matter with your face?

146
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:26,930
- Hi, Teacher Oh! Good morning.
- Yeah, good morning.

147
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:31,540
- It's hot, and he caught a cold, so...
- I see.

148
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:34,210
Work hard.

149
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,390
Hey, what's wrong with you? Did you fight?
Where, when, and whom with?

150
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,090
No. While riding the bike.

151
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:48,510
You got hurt this specifically while riding a bike?
I see.

152
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,800
You don't want to talk, huh?

153
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:58,770
Fine. Fine. No report came through to the school, so I don't think it was something big. There's nothing special going on?

154
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,970
No. I'm sorry.

155
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:06,710
Fine. Cover this up well and cough a lot.
Yeah, okay. Hey, Hui Yeong and Gi Tae.

156
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,830
Hello.

157
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:13,210
How could you catch a cold like this?
Seriously.

158
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:29,580
I think the kids got scared when the cops showed up.

159
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,340
Next time they'll make sure to finish it off.

160
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:39,290
Nothing will happen because of those kids, right?

161
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:44,190
- I don't think so. Not much.
- What if something does?

162
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:55,000
Don't worry. You've got me.

163
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,080
Byeongmun High School

164
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,570
For lunch today, too, am I on duty?

165
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:11,970
- Yes, you are.
- It'll be for two meals then.

166
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,600
Oh, Oh Jae, when are we going to practice our English?

167
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,010
- Oh, later on?
- Why? Can't we do it now?

168
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:20,110
Later.

169
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,600
Hi.

170
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,960
Yeah. Hi.

171
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,740
Oh. The teachers will notice it more that way.

172
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:42,920
- It must hurt.
- Not at all.

173
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,920
Oh, have you practiced English a lot?

174
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,180
A little.

175
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:04,210
A little probably won't do.

176
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:18,900
I washed it. Thank you.

177
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,130
Oh. If you...
do that, it'll get wrinkled.

178
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:29,570
I ironed it well for you.

179
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:56,890
You said you didn't have an iron,
but it looks well pressed.

180
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:10,260
Ro Mi, I scribbled down a few things for our EF, and—

181
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,020
Yoon Pil Sang.

182
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,750
Get lost.

183
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:16,050
Okay. Right.

184
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,930
- Hi, hi.
- Hi!

185
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:29,310
- Hi.
- What are you doing?

186
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,090
Smells.

187
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,990
Joon Woo, did you get into something?

188
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:44,370
Fight?

189
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,950
Oh, Choi Joon Woo,
I guess you got into a fight yesterday.

190
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:53,630
Who was it?
Our area has been quiet these days...

191
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:56,650
Right, Pil Sang?
Pil Sang.

192
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:59,500
Hey, Choi Joon Woo must have gotten beat up somewhere.

193
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,240
- Right? That's why he's wearing a mask, right?
- Yeah.

194
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,520
As expected, that FT (forced transfer) kid.

195
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,580
I don't think so.
I heard that he fell off his bike.

196
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,990
- What.
- No, no. I doubt it.

197
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,860
Yoo Soo Bin.

198
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,430
Yes, Ro Mi?

199
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,200
- I heard you're taking Teacher Son's class.
- Really?

200
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,400
Oh, did you pass the level test?
I knew you could do it.

201
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,500
I heard it's not easy to even take the level test.
How did you take it?

202
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,380
- What happened is...
- I recommended her.

203
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,620
Because I thought she was qualified.

204
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:36,200
Did you even take the level test?

205
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,910
Yes. Ro Mi, can you come talk to me for a second--

206
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:42,360
Hwi Yeong, let's talk.

207
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,720
Later. I need to do this now.

208
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,000
Later.

209
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,300
No, let's talk right now.

210
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,110
Hey, Hwang Ro Mi.

211
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:59,770
- That rude brat.
- Stop it.

212
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:01,760
When someone is talking you need to respond.

213
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,080
- Ro Mi.
- Now, now.

214
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,960
Let's get started. Take your seats.

215
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:14,030
Why does the mood seem so dark?

216
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:18,280
Pil Sang, why does your face look the darkest?

217
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,860
I-It wasn't me.

218
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:34,490
Ro Mi.

219
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,800
Why didn't you tell us that day?
When you came from somewhere when we were at the cafe.

220
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,070
You were coming back from taking the level test, right?

221
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:44,350
It felt awkward telling you then.

222
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:47,830
Did you feel awkward because you felt guilty?

223
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,460
In a way, yes.
Since Hwi Yeong recommended me.

224
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:56,310
Also, I could've failed the test,
so I didn't feel the need to tell you.

225
00:24:56,310 --> 00:25:00,200
But you passed, thanks to Hwi Yeong's favor.

226
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,180
I did pass.

227
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:08,930
I think that I passed because of my own skills.
When I got home, I went over the problems.

228
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:11,600
And I did pretty well on the test.

229
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,540
So annoying.
This type of special treatment and opportunities.

230
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,700
- Ro Mi, It's not like that.
- Stop.

231
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,410
I don't want to talk to you.

232
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,240
Hwang Ro Mi.

233
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,430
Did you two fight?

234
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,750
I'm not you.

235
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:40,870
Yes, we fought.

236
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,960
Did you win?

237
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,070
Then you did win.

238
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:52,270
Losing is winning.

239
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,690
The mask really doesn't suit you.

240
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:07,700
Yes, yes.

241
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,290
If possible,

242
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:12,630
I want to meet Joon Woo's previous homeroom teacher.

243
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,540
Yes.

244
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,100
Hello?

245
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:19,400
Yes, then please call me—

246
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,710
What was that?

247
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:27,160
Teacher, some student told me to give this to you.

248
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,720
Oh, yes. Thank you.

249
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:35,250
From Sin Jeong Woo

250
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:38,630
Sin Jeong Woo from Byungmoon High?

251
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:43,090
Excuse me, Teacher, did you just receive this?

252
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,200
Hey, Sin Jeong Woo!

253
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,080
Hey, Jeong—
Jeong Woo!

254
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,560
Okay. Today we'll be learning about city systems.

255
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,080
Okay. Especially in our country, Seoul—

256
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,260
Oh, gas! Gas!

257
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,140
Pil Sang, open the windows, please.

258
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,970
Stop farting!

259
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,200
Jeong Woo, hold on! Hey, Sin Jeong Woo!

260
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,100
What is Teacher Oh doing out there?

261
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,300
- Why? What is it?
- Hey, Sin Jeong...

262
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,780
Sin Jeong Woo!

263
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,580
Hey, Sin Jeong Woo!
Come here! Wait up!

264
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,300
- Wait a sec. Hey, Sin Jeong Woo!

265
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,450
- Jeong Woo?
- Sin Jeong...

266
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:25,280
Joon Woo, where are you going during class?

267
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,500
What will I do with him?

268
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:31,580
Jeong Woo! Oh, cramp.

269
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,900
Oh, Joon Woo!
Joon Woo, Jeong Woo!

270
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,860
Joon Woo!

271
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:44,550
Hey!

272
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,730
Please, just once.

273
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,240
Thank you.

274
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,900
Can you lend me some money for the bus fare?

275
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:18,290
Don't you have to go to school?

276
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:20,260
I do.

277
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,300
I'm in trouble now.

278
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,050
You'll get expelled if you get caught again.

279
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:35,940
What am I supposed to do?
This is a first for me.

280
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,880
Aren't you even angry?

281
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,840
He put all of the blame on you.

282
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,590
Jeong Woo.

283
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:53,080
Let's start over.
Somewhere else. Okay?

284
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,480
I dropped out of school.

285
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:08,620
For now, I'm just going to work,
without having to think about anything.

286
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,620
Joon Woo.

287
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:22,280
I'm sorry about what happened back then.

288
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:29,290
You were falsely accused because
of me and even forced to transfer.

289
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:33,030
Sorry.

290
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,600
I'm fine.

291
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,280
I'm doing well here, and that's enough for me.

292
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,580
Joon Woo.

293
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,440
What?

294
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:52,530
What is it?

295
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,860
Is your new school okay?

296
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,170
Don't worry.

297
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,740
Be careful of the kids at your school.

298
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:01,200
You never know.

299
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,490
I'm not scared at all.

300
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:06,090
You're one to talk.
If anyone bothers you again,

301
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:07,750
You better call this hyung at any time.

302
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,400
What do you mean, Hyung?

303
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,680
I'll go see you during summer break.

304
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,120
- You'll let me sleepover, right?
- Hurry back to school, punk.

305
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:30,530
Jeong Woo.

306
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:37,620
Our lives aren't ruined.

307
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,900
No, who cares if we were born with a twisted life?

308
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:45,260
We can undo it, don't you think?

309
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,320
I'll see you again.

310
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,060
Bye.

311
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,730
- Did you meet Sin Jeong Woo?
- Yes.

312
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:28,650
He left me a letter.

313
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:32,510
That the reason you were forced to transfer
was that you took the blame for him.

314
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:36,730
Oh, my. This kid...

315
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,070
What is it?

316
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:41,300
Yes, yes, Teacher.
We ended up having to talk a bit longer.

317
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:45,700
He caught a cold without me allowing it!

318
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,940
More, more.

319
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:56,220
High ranking officials.were at the center.

320
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,740
While monopolizing the government
and power for generations

321
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,920
and establishing elite wealthy families,
they lived a life of luxury.

322
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:08,790
However, gradually over time, passing
the civil service examination came to be valued,

323
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:11,400
and following the day of the announcement,
all the results...

324
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:19,200
Okay, bye.

325
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,580
See you later at the academy, Soo Bin.

326
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,290
I'll see you later.

327
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:27,030
Okay.

328
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,800
Ro Mi, you're not going to practice EF?

329
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,600
I'm not.

330
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,720
Ro Mi, I scribbled a little more for our EF, and—

331
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,600
Just memorize perfectly what I gave you.

332
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,520
Ro Mi, your temper.

333
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,250
Put on full bridal make up why don't you?

334
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:45,590
Are you that happy being partners with Oh Jae?

335
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,810
Yeah. Oh Jae, see you later.

336
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:16,180
Are you happy now?

337
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:22,630
But what did you talk about with Teacher Oh Han Gyeol,

338
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,800
while not attending class?

339
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:28,930
It's not that we talked.

340
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:30,820
A single round again?

341
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,590
No.

342
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:37,360
A type of a...
shield of Teacher Han Gyeol?

343
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,280
Cover?

344
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:45,670
Let's just practice English.

345
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:48,290
Let's do it over there then.

346
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:55,530
What is it?

347
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:57,750
The English composition you gave me.

348
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,350
Read it then.

349
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:04,750
I'm shy about it.

350
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:13,000
What's your dream?

351
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:17,810
- So-me people says dream is something great.
- Hey.

352
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:20,860
Wait, wait.

353
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:24,600
Some.
It's some. S-O-M-E.

354
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:28,320
Right.
It's some. I knew this.

355
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,380
You knew but...

356
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:35,120
Somewhat... nervous?

357
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,040
Okay. Try it again.

358
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,620
Some people says dream is something great.

359
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,600
But my dream is fall asleep

360
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,380
in a dark room. Yes.

361
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:51,140
When I was a kid and with the lights turned off...

362
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:55,350
Would come to haunt me in a dark room.

363
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:58,030
But here, slept with.

364
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:01,510
You have to memorize this well.
Slept with. You can't say sleep.

365
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:04,720
Just memorize them together.

366
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,370
If you want the meaning to come across properly,
you can't omit "with."

367
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:12,180
I know that much.

368
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:15,540
Oh yeah?
Then what was up with so-me?

369
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,590
So-me people?

370
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,190
It's nice weather.

371
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:29,090
But... is your dream really this?

372
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,390
Then what about yours?

373
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:38,590
Escape from mom?

374
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:43,740
Let's go over this.
What's important right now is yours.

375
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,900
I'll say it for you once.

376
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,780
I hope your dream comes true.

377
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:51,350
My dream is to escape.

378
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:53,850
Escape?

379
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:56,120
Oh, you put some emotion into it, too. I see.

380
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:59,830
You're kind of good at this now.

381
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:02,090
I see hope.

382
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:07,560
- Academy?
- Yeah.

383
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,210
Go then.

384
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,760
You have to practice a lot today, okay?

385
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,600
Especially the parts I marked.

386
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,050
Yes, yes.

387
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,030
Hurry up and go.

388
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,530
Wait.

389
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,140
Here. Every time you read this,

390
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:39,120
color this in.

391
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,400
Grapes?

392
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,800
1, 2, 3....

393
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,870
50 times?

394
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:55,200
You know that 50 times is still not enough, right?

395
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,780
I'm adding ten more.

396
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,760
It's enough.

397
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,250
- Go.
- Okay.

398
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:11,740
Okay. Work hard!
Stay up all night!

399
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:24,960
- Oh, what is it?
- Soo Bin, is it true?

400
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,610
Huh?

401
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:28,810
Your EF partner is the kid that was forced to transfer?

402
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:33,160
What's the matter with Teacher Oh Han Gyeol?
Is an exam a joke?

403
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,210
How can he pair you up with a kid like that?

404
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:39,100
Teacher Oh Han Gyeol didn't pair me up
but we picked it randomly.

405
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,510
Randomly?

406
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,520
I came up with the idea, Mom.

407
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,360
How can you pick randomly for a test? Hey!

408
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,510
Soo Bin!

409
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,320
Hello.

410
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:56,950
Joon Woo.

411
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,870
Joon Woo. Joon Woo.

412
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:00,990
Joon Woo.

413
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,180
Joon...

414
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,860
I knew this would happen.

415
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,800
You pretended to wash this morning to hide this, didn't you?

416
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,810
Let's see. My God!

417
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:24,280
Mom. How did you find out?

418
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,600
Park Young Bae, don't you know all the mothers
of this world are psychic?

419
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,580
They have instincts like no other!

420
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:33,780
You can't lie to her.

421
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:36,740
What do I do with you?

422
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:39,820
Oh, what is this?

423
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:45,100
I'm fine. It's nothing.

424
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:48,430
You're serious, right?
Nothing is going on, right?

425
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:51,550
I'm being serious.
It's been sorted out.

426
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:56,880
What I had to go through to save you from that place.

427
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:03,000
Trust me, Mom.

428
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:07,450
You said I'm the only one in this world you can trust.

429
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,820
Nothing will happen.

430
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,220
Trust me, okay?

431
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,890
Okay.

432
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:18,590
Go. You're going to be late for work again.

433
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:26,400
I left side-dishes at home.
Make sure to eat breakfast, okay?

434
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,760
Okay. I'll get you a taxi.

435
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,960
I can take the bus.

436
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,530
Don't you ever fight.

437
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:34,760
Don't get hit either, got it?

438
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,970
You promised me, okay?

439
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:39,550
I got it. Don't worry.

440
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,760
I'll get going.

441
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:52,760
The soup is in the freezer.
Heat it up in the microwave!

442
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,870
Okay. Oh, be careful.

443
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,680
- Bye.
- Okay! Okay!

444
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,650
- Be careful!
- Okay!

445
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,620
Soo Bin, let's go together.

446
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,080
Okay.

447
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:19,490
Do you have something on your mind?

448
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:25,740
Hui Yeong, I think I'm going
to quit Teacher Son Jae Young's class.

449
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:32,180
Don't worry too much about what Ro Mi said.

450
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:36,970
It's not that I'm worried, but
I just dislike feeling uncomfortable like this.

451
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:40,970
What's so uncomfortable? You're my friend,
so I recommended you to Teacher Son Jae Young,

452
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:43,000
and you prepared the level test on your own and got in.

453
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,890
A-Also, Hui Yeong...

454
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:52,250
Yeah? It's okay.
Tell me.

455
00:40:54,090 --> 00:41:01,730
I'd like it if you didn't talk to your friends
like I'm your girlfriend.

456
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:04,750
I know you do that for my sake,

457
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:08,700
but still, it feels a little bit...

458
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:13,990
Yoo Soo Bin.

459
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:16,060
Yeah?

460
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:20,690
Why do you always feel like that with me?

461
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:24,900
You were like that even when I brought
you clothes when you got rained on,

462
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,860
and being my girlfriend feels like that, too.

463
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:33,370
You're always saying, "It feels a little bit..."

464
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:36,090
Hui Yeong...

465
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:38,870
You weren't like that before.

466
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:43,100
We were good, close friends.

467
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:52,340
Ma Hui Young kiddo...

468
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:55,050
He's making me feel bad...

469
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:31,410
I know you're doing that for my sake,

470
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:33,910
but still, it feels a little bit...

471
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:38,510
She knows but ignores it.

472
00:42:56,380 --> 00:43:00,500
You're late.
Academy was over with much earlier.

473
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,560
I went to exercise.

474
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:09,730
Son.
Your study isn't being affected because of Soo Bin, right?

475
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:11,850
Mom.

476
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,260
I'm going up.

477
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,500
I believe in you.

478
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,880
It's good.

479
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,790
I can see why people ask for Teacher Son.

480
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:29,680
- Really?
- Yeah.

481
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:34,460
I'll recheck the level test,
and if I didn't get in because of my skills, I'll quit the class.

482
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:37,780
If you do, can I take the test for that class?

483
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,840
Yeah, of course.

484
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,780
But let's not have things like
this make it awkward between us.

485
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,480
We're friends, aren't we?

486
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,450
Mom, Teacher Son Jae Young's math—

487
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:49,970
Why? Did he say something?

488
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:52,280
Just...

489
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:55,820
Nothing. It's nothing.

490
00:43:55,820 --> 00:44:02,080
A-Also, the English free talking for school,
I would like for you to not say anything.

491
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,750
I've decided not to.

492
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:07,000
What if I say something and you become disliked?

493
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,480
But just don't get close to that forced transfer student, okay?

494
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,280
You wouldn't, but you have to be careful of kids like that.

495
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:18,630
By the way, what about this?

496
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:21,300
I still sleep with lights on.

497
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:24,990
Not because I'm scared of ghosts but...
What's after that?

498
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:27,510
I can't finish the composition unless you tell me.

499
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:31,530
I see. That...

500
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:36,300
Because it might be too dark when
your parents come home at night. Right?

501
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,310
Then?

502
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:46,020
Not because I'm scared of ghosts
but because I'm scared of zombies.

503
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:46,890
Oh, zombies...

504
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:49,750
What?
That's all the same.

505
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:52,010
I'm kidding.

506
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:57,120
It's just... a habit?

507
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:03,010
Maybe because it's become a habit,
I can't fall asleep when the lights are off.

508
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:08,560
Choi Joon Woo...

509
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,010
You're my precious...

510
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:18,030
Practice sleeping with the lights off starting tonight.

511
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:20,400
You're not a baby after all.
Be honest.

512
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,100
It's because you're scared, right? If you turn
the light off at night, you think the ghosts will come out.

513
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,180
- You're wrong.
- Oh, I don't think that's true.

514
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:27,850
Oh, I don't think that's true.

515
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,490
Sleep with the lights off starting tonight.

516
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:33,020
Do you know how much electricity costs
if you keep doing that?

517
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:35,920
You don't have a thrifty mentality. Got it?

518
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:48,230
So he slept like this since he was little, huh?

519
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:54,460
It must have been uncomfortable.

520
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:16,860
Not because I'm afraid of ghosts but...

521
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:22,270
because it's lessened when the lights are on...

522
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:25,420
The feeling of loneliness.

523
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:51,480
- You came?
- I did.

524
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,860
It's cute, huh?
His name is Bap-pul. (rice kernel)

525
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,490
His name is Bap-pul. (rice kernel)

526
00:46:55,490 --> 00:46:57,700
Hey. What kind of name is that?

527
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:00,660
It's cute.

528
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,700
Cute!

529
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:29,790
I got bombarded with texts all night!

530
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:34,550
A large number of parents are still making complaints.

531
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:38,670
Forget about the English free talking test.

532
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:40,340
Pardon?

533
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,680
I can't do that.

534
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:49,570
How can I stop the test just because of the parents' protests?
As a teacher, I have some dignity.

535
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:53,990
Teacher Oh, are you saying you
won't follow through with my request?

536
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:55,170
No.

537
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:58,120
Right? Now...

538
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,130
I'm going to the educational office for a meeting.

539
00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:16,560
Teacher Oh, are you okay?
Teacher!

540
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,510
Has the Vice Principal left?

541
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:22,240
Yes. He went to a meeting at the educational office.

542
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:29,100
What should I do?

543
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:33,480
Do what? Be impudent!

544
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:55,680
Now, the time for everyone to be happy.
English free talking will

545
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,890
now begin!

546
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:05,890
I prepared this myself.

547
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:07,080
Have you memorized everything?

548
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,890
The first couple will be...

549
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:19,560
Kwon Da Huin, Jeong Oh Jae!

550
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,720
Come out, come on.

551
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,160
Ready? Action.

552
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,550
Da Huin, what is your dream in life?

553
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:31,190
My dream is to become a makeup artist one day.

554
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:32,750
Wow, that's cool.

555
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:35,750
What made you want to be a makeup artist?

556
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:37,690
I always liked to wear makeup.

557
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:41,530
I'm happy when I see how pretty I am after my work is done.

558
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:43,460
Do you become more confident?

559
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:44,310
Yes.

560
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:49,310
And that's why I started to think
that I want to do this for other people, too.

561
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:53,560
I want them to be happy when
they look at themselves in the mirror.

562
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:57,220
So, your dream is to make other people happy.

563
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:00,030
I think you will be a great makeup artist

564
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:03,730
because you're beautiful inside and out.

565
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:06,390
- I hope you achieve your dream.
- Eww!

566
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:09,990
Points will be taken off, Oh Jae!

567
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:13,530
Now, give a round of applause for their hard work.

568
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:16,810
She was that good in English?

569
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:18,820
The power of love.

570
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:26,480
Teacher, I have one more dream.

571
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,160
Huh?

572
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:29,890
Da Huin, we're done.

573
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:38,110
My other dream is...
I want to be your girlfriend.

574
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:40,090
What? What?

575
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:45,370
Very romantic!

576
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:48,600
Date each other! Date each other!

577
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,190
Date each other!

578
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:52,380
Date each other! Date each other!

579
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:53,250
Okay.

580
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:56,120
Date each other!

581
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,950
Hey, be quiet!

582
00:50:57,950 --> 00:51:00,300
Quiet down!

583
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:07,280
You actually listened to me this time?

584
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,830
I'm not Hui Yeong.

585
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:12,150
Tea... cher.

586
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:15,270
What are you... Oh, that scared me.

587
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:23,120
Teacher Oh, come speak with me for a second.

588
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,770
I'm in the middle of class.

589
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:29,720
Please work independently.
Please, Hui Yeong.

590
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:30,530
Yes.

591
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:32,450
Teacher?

592
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:37,260
Then do some work independently.

593
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,560
What's going on?

594
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:40,860
Let's be quiet.

595
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:43,920
Teacher Oh, is what I say meaningless?

596
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,170
No. The kids prepared very hard and...

597
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:49,730
as I told you earlier—

598
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:51,840
Come to the office.

599
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:54,760
Yes.

600
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:03,160
Only Kwon Da Huin made out like a bandit.

601
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:06,150
The biggest beneficiary of the English Free talk.

602
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:09,190
Right? Oh, I'm so happy.

603
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:12,150
Hey, I think Teacher Oh is feeling down.

604
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:14,400
Hui Yeong is going to close out the class, too.

605
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,540
But who keeps pressuring the Vice Principal?

606
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:19,440
It's not my mom.

607
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,560
I have somebody that comes to mind.

608
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,980
Me?

609
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:28,200
Whoa, I have never said it was you.

610
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,530
Guilty all on your own?

611
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:31,930
- Moon Chan Yeol, you—
- Hold up!

612
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:34,910
You were going to hit me with that?

613
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:38,260
Hit me. Hit me!

614
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:41,570
No, stop! Hey!

615
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:44,960
Stop! I'm upset, too!

616
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:47,370
Upset about what?
You didn't have to do it!

617
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:50,890
Because you didn't get to partner up with Choi Joon Woo?

618
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:56,990
That's right! I worked so hard to teach that rock head!
It was all in vain!

619
00:52:56,990 --> 00:53:01,650
Exactly, so isn't it better that we didn't get to do it?

620
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:05,790
I don't know.
Anyway, you guys quit fighting. Seriously.

621
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:08,270
It's so noisy!

622
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,090
She says to stop fighting.

623
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:18,950
What is this sad feeling?

624
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:22,570
It's because of the time I invested...

625
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:26,590
Anyway, stop teaching Class 3.

626
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:31,510
It's the wish of the parents and me and the homeroom teacher.

627
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,460
I'm sorry.

628
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:56,000
This keeps rolling over here by itself.

629
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,110
I see that.

630
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:00,070
Why? Did something happen?

631
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:02,040
It's the kids from your last school, right?
These punks, why I should just...

632
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,950
- Come on, lead me to them.
- No.

633
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:08,490
I just had a question.

634
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:10,250
What is it?

635
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:19,600
What?

636
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:22,270
What's your dream?

637
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:23,450
What are you doing?

638
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:26,470
I was curious about what your dream is.

639
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,670
If it's a secret, then...

640
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:35,870
My dream is...

641
00:54:35,870 --> 00:54:38,890
Oh, I don't understand English too well.

642
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:42,820
Right? My dream is...

643
00:54:42,830 --> 00:54:46,110
Oh, unboxing limited edition...

644
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:53,650
No, no. Not pathetically waiting for unpaid
wages or off-season and just spending everything!

645
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:57,540
I'm a shopaholic by nature.

646
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:00,870
I don't think that's it.

647
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:02,190
Right? It's not, right?

648
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:04,720
What was it?
What's my dream again?

649
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:08,520
Now that I think about it, I'm not sure.

650
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,290
Why?

651
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:17,140
You're similar to me.
Missing a dream.

652
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:19,020
Whoa. Not true.

653
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:22,820
I... I drank a lot from being upset with you kids,

654
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:26,080
so my memory has been lessened, that's why.

655
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:29,090
- That's not it.
- You've become really talkative.

656
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:30,640
Teacher!

657
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:34,340
What are you doing?
We practice so much for EF!

658
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,970
Soo Bin, I'm sorry. I...

659
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:40,690
I want to do it here then.

660
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:43,570
It was difficult for me to train this kid.

661
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:44,840
It feels unfair to not do it.

662
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,850
You trained him?

663
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:50,610
Then wait a minute. Let me see...

664
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:57,590
I will make a special test for you.

665
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:59,780
What's your dream?

666
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:05,360
Some people says dream is something great.

667
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,150
My dream is...

668
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:08,830
You forgot. Points off.

669
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:12,010
No, no. Wait.

670
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,350
Oh, please.

671
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:17,560
But my dream is

672
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:22,300
- to fall asleep with the lights turned off.
- Soo Bin is smiling.

673
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:25,810
Is that your real dream?

674
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:28,570
Yes. When I was a kid

675
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:31,360
and I had to sleep alone,

676
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:34,700
I always slept with the lights on

677
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:39,020
because I was afraid that monster,

678
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:45,600
ghosts and zombies would
come to haunt me in a dark room.

679
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:47,780
Everyone is like that when they're little.

680
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:49,350
Do you still feel that way?

681
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:50,770
Yes.

682
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:56,790
I'm, I'm still sleep with the lights on.

683
00:56:56,790 --> 00:57:02,140
not because I'm scared of ghosts.

684
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:04,490
I hope your dream comes true.

685
00:57:04,490 --> 00:57:08,210
My dream is to escape.

686
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:09,290
Escape?

687
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:14,100
I want to escape from my mom
by going to college as soon as possible.

688
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:18,230
Does your mom pressure you a lot?

689
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:20,840
My mom only cares about results.

690
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:24,680
So, I've always disappointed her.

691
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:27,350
That must be hard on you.

692
00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:33,900
So, I want to show her that
she doesn't always have a right answer.

693
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:42,220
My dream is to live by my own standard,
not my mother's or society.

694
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:45,730
I know you will make it work.

695
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:50,460
I'm rooting for you.

696
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:52,100
You!

697
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:55,080
Choi Joon Woo! You, you worked hard!

698
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:57,180
You worked so hard.

699
00:57:57,180 --> 00:58:02,000
Now, now then, this is unofficial,

700
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,670
but you two... both get 100.

701
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:09,210
A hundred!

702
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:13,150
To celebrate that, should we go get some pizza?

703
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:14,360
- Good.
- Call!

704
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,700
Call. Let's go.

705
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:19,110
Oh... I have to go to my part-time job.

706
00:58:19,110 --> 00:58:22,420
Come on.
You have a little time still.

707
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:28,150
- Call!
- Okay then, let's go.

708
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:31,940
Aigoo, you worked hard, you worked hard.

709
00:58:31,950 --> 00:58:35,160
Ah, let's see.

710
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,080
Hello?

711
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:41,750
Yes.

712
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:44,780
What?

713
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:49,060
Emergency Medical Center

714
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,330
I thought you'd be scared.

715
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:18,500
Hey, Sin Jeong Woo.

716
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:25,830
Joon Woo. I'm sorry.

717
00:59:25,830 --> 00:59:30,200
Jeong Woo. Our lives aren't ruined.

718
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:32,580
No, who cares if we were born a twisted life?

719
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:35,680
We can undo it, don't you think?

720
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:57,520
Jeong Woo.

721
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:12,140
Joon Woo.

722
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:16,100
I came with the kids.

723
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:19,600
Are you okay?

724
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:25,520
Okay, let's go outside. Let's go.

725
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:41,300
I guess he has no family.

726
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:44,150
He has a father, but we can't get in contact with him,

727
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:47,200
and his grandma is in a
nursing home because she has dementia.

728
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,610
I see.

729
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:53,770
Oh... I'm pretty sure Joon Woo didn't eat anything.

730
01:00:55,530 --> 01:00:58,770
Should we go buy something to eat?

731
01:00:58,770 --> 01:00:59,920
Should we do that?

732
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,420
I'll go.

733
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:12,430
- Do it quietly and come out.
- I think they are the students that attacked.

734
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,550
Who are they?

735
01:02:07,050 --> 01:02:09,520
Let's go now.

736
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:18,430
That bastard didn't come.

737
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:22,090
Do you know Lee Gi Tae?
He's in your class.

738
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:27,000
That bastard paid us.
To make you get expelled.

739
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:33,090
We were going to stop after one payment.

740
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:36,040
Lim Geon Hyeok, I said let's go.

741
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:47,410
♬ Please don’t say a word ♬

742

743

♬ Like a journey coming to an end ♬

744
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:59,880
Because you offend me. 
♬ Let it run like the river ♬

745
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:05,970
Because you kept making issues of things when all you had
to do was just go along with it quietly and disappear.

746
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:09,120
For me.
♬ we were young ♬

01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:56,630

Moment at Eighteen
~ Preview ~

769
01:04:32,970 --> 01:04:34,840
Did you give money to those guys?
Are you crazy?

770
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,570
Do you think he's going to be loyal to you?

771
01:04:36,570 --> 01:04:38,430
My friend died because of you guys.

772
01:04:38,430 --> 01:04:39,830
I'll even get on my knees.

773
01:04:39,830 --> 01:04:41,910
You're already a goner, but I'm not, Joon Woo.

774
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:44,560
When Choi Joon Woo was beating you,
why did you just take it?

775
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:46,220
I guess I was like that in front of Ma Hui Yeong?

776
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:47,910
If you feel wronged, I wanted to help.

777
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:50,960
Why would you help me?
Is it pity?

778
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,730
Could you please tell me exactly what you saw?

779
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:54,570
Thank you, Geon Hyeok.

780
01:04:54,570 --> 01:04:56,350
Mom, help me.

781
01:04:56,350 --> 01:04:57,180
Embarrassed?
You’re embarrassed?!

782
01:04:57,180 --> 01:04:59,840
Did you give birth to me because you
wanted to brag and show off?

783
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:01,430
I can't go to Seoul University.

784
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:02,160
Are you okay?

785
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:05,000
Why am I doing this to you?
You're asking if it's out of pity?

786
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,850
♬ Oh you know me ♬

787
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:12,630
♬ All the moments we shared
are not going anywhere ♬
