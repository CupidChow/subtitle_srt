1
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,560
What is it?

2
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,180
I have to go to the restroom for a sec.

3
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,170
I agonized over it for a while
and because I was worried about you...

4
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,240
It's something Choi Joon Woo sent me before.

5
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:08,090
Yoo Soo Bin is the person most precious to you, right?

6
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,700
I'll take her from you.

7
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,160
Soo Bin.

8
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,530
Is something wrong?

9
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,640
Mom is telling me to come home.

10
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,300
Mom? Let's go.

11
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:31,080
You... should finish the movie.
I'll leave first.

12
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,150
What's the point of seeing it alone?
When you're not here?

13
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,670
Let's hurry up and go.

14
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:44,690
Sorry.

15
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,600
Let's hurry up and go.

16
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,130
♬ Please don’t say a word ♬

17
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:02,170
♬ Cuz they all have been said now ♬

18
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,710
♬ Like a journey coming to an end ♬

19
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,680
Go ahead. I'll go on my own.

20
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,980
♬ You say ♬

21
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,100
♬ Let it run like the river ♬

22
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,680
I can't ask you.

23
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,960
Whether the text you sent to Hui Yeong is real.

24
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,800
Even if it is, I'm afraid I'll still like you.

Soo Bin, wait. Wait a moment.

37
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:03,630
I think she has a fever.

38
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:07,630
What are you doing, Yoo Soo Bin?
Why are you waiting?

39
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:13,980
Just go. Go. 
♬ And I was always scared to face the truth ♬

40
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,640
♬ Now I’m still ♬

00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,220
♬ Really wish ♬

47
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:44,360
She said you could have indigestion,
so I bought digestive medicine, too.

48
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,710
♬ All the moments we shared ♬

49
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:53,660
Maybe, did your mom find out that we were meeting up?

50
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:58,050
No. She just said to come home.

51
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:03,510
♬ Just close your eyes I’m by your side ♬

52
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,530
Go in. I'll leave.

53
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,380
Get well soon.

54
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,380
Oh, Hui Yeong.

55
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,870
- Hello.
- Right.

56
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:26,250
What to do?
Soo Bin went to meet up with some friends.

57
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,820
Mom.

58
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:35,370
Oh, you two planned to eat together?

59
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,410
That student carried Soo Bin here.

60
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,740
Oh, that's the kid who was forced to transfer, right?

61
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,020
I was worried about you.

62
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:03,240
That. Is it real?

63
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:13,670
Joon Woo seems to resent me.

64
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,580
He believes I am to blame for everything
that has happened to him so far.

65
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,190
It's all a misunderstanding though.

66
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,130
- Really?
- Huh?

67
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,690
Ma Hui Yeong, what have you done?

68
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,600
Hui Yeong, do me a favor.

69
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:47,140
I only want the two of us to know about this.

70
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,970
Perhaps, do Lee Gi Tae and others know already?

71
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:59,970
Don't tell Choi Joon Woo that I know about it either.

72
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,070
Because he might be embarrassed?

73
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,620
No.

74
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,030
It hurts my pride.

75
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,680
I'll go in.

76
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:51,010
I didn't get to give her the present.

77
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,150
Because I don't want him to take her from me.

78
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,770
Because I can't have her taken away.

79
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,380
What are you doing?

80
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,780
Alone?

81
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,010
Will you be okay?

82
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,950
Hey, why are you being so rough?

83
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,120
Ease up!

84
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,950
Is something wrong?

85
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,890
Go home.

86
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:55,020
What about you?
What do you do when you don't like yourself?

87
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,610
When you're angry at yourself?

88
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,140
Why are you angry?

89
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,690
Because I feel stupid.

90
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,810
No. Never mind.

91
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:19,710
Soo Bin, are you okay?

92
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,030
What's wrong with you now?

93
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,490
Oh Je.

94
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,300
Aren't you hot?

95
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,660
What brings you by?

96
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,980
Still, how could you just come home?

97
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,560
What could I do

98
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,480
when her mom told her to come home?

99
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,450
Are you sure?

100
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,340
Huh?

101
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:16,280
Aigoo, Choi Joon Woo, really...

102
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:21,440
Hey, what's the use in getting all
dressed up and doing your hair?

103
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,100
Did you get to see the movie at least?

104
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,550
- We came out in the middle...
- Huh?

105
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,430
I don't know.

106
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:38,100
To be honest, it's the first time I've liked someone.

107
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,750
First love?

108
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:47,530
Then it really is first love.

109
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:51,240
Ah, we should leave a record of this.

110
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,910
Right. First love...

111
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,760
It's nice, isn't it Choi Joon Woo?

112
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,280
It feels like you're

113
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,270
flying over those clouds, doesn't it?

114
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,090
Well... the nice feeling is still about this much.

115
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:21,240
The rest of it is this much which

116
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,730
feels heavy and it bothers me.

117
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:30,560
Unsettled and numb.

118
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,720
You just feel bad about yourself.

119
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,740
Just breathing makes me feel like
I'm making a mistake toward her.

120
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,910
Even though I want to do well,

121
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,900
it feels like I keep making mistakes.

122
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:54,250
But at least you can like someone.

123
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,790
Be strong, punk.

124
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:02,340
What's the issue when you both like each other?

125
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:15,090
Yes, Teacher, I'm in the lobby right now.

126
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:18,540
Yes, yes.
Building B, #1901. I'll be right up.

127
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,210
Yes.

128
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,230
Soo Bin's mom...

129
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,010
You live here?

130
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:29,490
Yeah. Yangjaedong apartment hasn't been vacated yet.

131
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:32,410
Move. Soo Bin is going to get tutored here.

132
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,600
Really? S-Starting when?
D-Did she come with you?

133
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,380
She didn't, fortunately.

134
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,000
Wait, Soo Bin's mom.

135
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,950
Song Hee, are you okay?

136
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:51,820
- Are you okay?
- Let go. Go away.

137
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,680
Are you okay, I said.

138
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,180
Let go!

139
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,900
Song Hee, are you okay?

140
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,500
Are you okay? Huh?

141
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,780
Don't worry about it!

142
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:20,300
Hey, are you okay?
Hey are you hurt?

143
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:28,180
Seriously, so embarrassing...

144
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,480
What do I do?

145
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,260
Is she really sick?

146
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:53,210
Mom.
You're hurt? Why?

147
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,800
I fell when I went to see your tutor.

148
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,820
How? Why are you looking for another tutor?

149
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,870
It's not like the tutor pushed me.

150
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:28,650
She's not answering. I'm worried.

151
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:44,170
Why does it hurt so much when
I don't think I have a cold?

152
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,830
Did I do something wrong?

153
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,850
We went to the movies. We met.

154
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,860
Did I buy too much popcorn?

155
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,900
The cola was all warm,
and I couldn't find our seats well either.

156
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,120
Ah, when you came home,
you looked too pathetic, Choi Joon Woo.

157
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,830
Mom, are you sleeping?

158
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,530
You didn't eat, so I warmed up some milk.

159
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,760
Leave it.

160
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,650
Mom.

161
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:56,170
Something happened, didn't it?

162
00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:00,170
What do you mean?
My arm hurts too much, that's all.

163
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,070
Mom.

164
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,920
Do you have a fever?

165
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,060
Are you sick?

166
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,220
No.

167
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,390
Just, I'm not in the best condition.

168
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,810
I took medicine.

169
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:28,000
Go and sleep.

170
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,780
In a few minutes.

171
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,490
Don't get sick.

172
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,410
If you do, it makes you sad.

173
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,930
If you're sad...

174
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,350
you can't study well either.

175
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,900
Okay.

176
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,910
Don't be sick either.

177
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,540
Lover! Lover!
Did you have a good first date?

178
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,440
You even ignored our texts!

179
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,830
How honey-drippingly sweet like a macaroon was it?

180
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,310
You met up yesterday, too, right?
That's why you were distracted, right?

181
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:38,490
So I read it.

182
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,240
No, I didn't feel well.

183
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,460
We just watched a movie and
went home on Saturday, too. Something came up.

184
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,150
Huh?

185
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,330
Why? Your mom found out?

186
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:52,130
That's why you're like this, right?

187
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:55,400
Wow. Is a storm coming?

188
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,870
It's not like that.

189
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,720
Oh, Oh Je.

190
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,680
Oh. Hi.

191
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,640
Sorry I didn't call you.
I was at my grandma's farm.

192
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,490
Really? I see.

193
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,920
Me too...

194
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,400
Hi.

195
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,590
Hi.

196
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,250
You two look good together.

197
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:27,500
Oh, Hui Yeong, let me in, too.

198
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,850
You said they prep you for everything
including the interview with SNU.

199
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,450
What is Hwang Ro Mi up to now so passionately?

200
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,130
Let's go.

201
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,110
Da Huin.

202
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:54,010
Sorry. You know, the others were around.
That's why.

203
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,500
Are you mad?

204
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:58,950
Huh?

205
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,870
Don't be upset. Huh?

206
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:07,700
What is this?
You brought this from your grandma's farm?

207
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,060
It's really cute.

208
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:15,460
I can't be angry at you.

209
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,620
Sorry.

210
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,120
So don't be upset, huh?

211
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:21,920
Huh?

212
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,420
Fine.

213
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,200
What do I do?
You have to be at the top of your class to join.

214
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,720
I'll come in first place in the next exam.
That'll do it, no?

215
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,090
Huh?

216
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,390
Ro Mi.

217
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,930
Then I'll introduce you to another tutoring class.

218
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:37,130
You know Park Si An in class 2?

219
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,790
- He's preparing for SNU, too, and—
- No.

220
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:43,500
I want to be in your group!
That's the only sure way to get into SNU!

221
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,670
Hwang Ro Mi.

222
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,400
Ro Mi!

223
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:02,350
My mom wants to know when you're going to pay
the consulting fee. You applied, too, I heard.

224
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:06,060
Yeah. My mom must have forgotten.
I'll tell her to send the payment.

225
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:09,600
By the way, I saw Yoo Soo Bin at the movie theater.

226
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,600
She was there with Choi Joon Woo
to watch a movie on Saturday.

227
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:18,300
Mom

228
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,220
Yeah, Mom.

229
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,040
Yeah.

230
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,140
Oh no!

231
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,600
Hey, are you going to head this?

232
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,110
No.

233
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,300
Do you want the rest?

234
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,420
Thanks.

235
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:09,820
Guys, this is the application for science camp.
Hand it in by today if you're interested in participating.

236
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:31,290
Yes, ma'am. You wanted to see me?

237
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:37,220
Our Hui Yeong's English performance score.

238
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:41,280
Why is it not perfect?

239
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:46,200
Oh, yes. That is because he's great at presentation,

240
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,090
but a little lacking in collaborative skills.

241
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:54,690
But he's superior to others so don't worry too much.

242
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:58,750
So this is when you use this word.
I am flabbergasted.

243
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,560
He's never gotten anything but a perfect score.

244
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,180
Ma'am, just because Hui Yeong continually got

245
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:09,770
a perfect score up until now,

246
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:13,670
it doesn't mean all our grading has to follow that precedent.

247
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:16,870
Why are you talking about precedent here right now?

248
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:19,140
Teacher, our Hui Yeong

249
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:24,720
isn't someone whom you can grade down however you wish.

250
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,000
Haven't you heard from other teachers?

251
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,390
I didn't grade down... however I wished.

252
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:34,260
Ma'am, I, as a teacher, grade the kids

253
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,910
after careful consideration.

254
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:41,300
What you said just now is a little... bothersome.

255
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:49,560
Okay. I see what you're saying.

256
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,300
Oh, I just got it now.

257
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:56,900
I've been so busy lately so I wasn't able to take care of you.
- Pardon?

258
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,790
Pardon?

259
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,840
I'll discuss it with my husband.

260
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,520
Thank you for your time today.

261
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:09,080
Excuse me, what do you mean?

262
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:13,630
Oh, Teacher Oh, you're a real trickster,
unlike how you look.

263
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,500
Fine, fine.

264
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,260
I'll take good care of you.

265
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,550
What does she get?

266
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:32,750
Excuse me, ma'am!

267
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:36,110
I don't understand at all what you mean. Ma'am?

268
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:48,130
I definitely told you I liked Choi Joon Woo, didn't I?
How could you go see a movie with him?

269
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,200
He asked me to.

270
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,610
Even if he did.

271
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,680
What's the reason I can't go see a movie with him?

272
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,470
We can go as classmates, can't we?

273
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:02,200
Why does that classmate have to be Choi Joon Woo?

274
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,780
Ro Mi, I wasn't going to say this.

275
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,860
But you said Choi Joon Woo told you
he just wanted to be friends with you.

276
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,790
He told you that much?

277
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:17,080
Anyway, even if he likes you instead of me,

278
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,270
how could you after giving me advice?

279
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:21,350
You knew about that, too?

280
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,460
Fine.

281
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,770
I'll be honest.
I like him, too.

282
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,610
I liked him.

283
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:37,430
Just because you liked him, it doesn't mean I can't.

284
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:41,600
You can't do anything about how you feel.

285
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:47,900
So... when I met you at the cafe,
I was going to tell you everything.

286
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:52,570
But you were so serious that I missed the opportunity.

287
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:55,510
Yeah, I'm sorry about missing the opportunity,

288
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:00,800
but why am I standing here explaining myself?

289
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,370
Never mind. Let's not do this anymore.

290
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:06,840
You liked him? That's past tense.

291
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:11,380
That you don't anymore.

292
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:14,860
You don't like him now, right?

293
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:23,340
Ro Mi, I understand how you feel,

294
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:28,580
but please stop whining at me. It's tiring for me, too.

295
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:32,170
You said it! That you don't like him!

296
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,380
When did I? I said I don't know.

297
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:43,940
Choi Joon Woo, you're late.

298
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:55,690
What do we do about our Pil Sang?

299
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,080
Let's go in.

300
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:33,070
The settlement system is made up of

301
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:36,980
cities and villages as people's living spaces.

302
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:41,210
The settlement system consists of the city
and village which form an organic relationship

303
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:44,040
and on a regular basis interact with each other

304
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,320
based on that settlement space.

305
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,690
Its center is where goods and services
are provided to the surrounding areas.

306
00:25:54,570 --> 00:26:00,520
Yoon So Ye, are you okay?
Are you sick?

307
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:21,270
You definitely said that you didn't like him.

308
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:39,810
I think it's true that Ro Mi likes Joon Woo.

309
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,610
Choi Joon Woo, you punk.

310
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:44,400
Yoo Pil Sang! Leave through the back.

311
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,740
It looks like it'll rain.

312
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:06,980
These punks.

313
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,530
- Gosh, that punk.
- He floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee.

314
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,930
- Walk naturally.
- Hey, hey, hey.

315
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:20,710
Is there something that you're mad at me about?
You keep avoiding me.

316
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,590
Gi Tae, you...

317
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:32,450
You should stop hanging out with Hui Yeong.
You're not his butler.

318
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:35,160
What do you mean, butler?

319
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,770
That's a little harsh.

320
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:41,130
You're being a butler,
tending to his needs at his beck and call.

321
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:44,600
You're always helping him and keeping things in his favor.

322
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,900
And that time, with Choi Joon Woo.

323
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,320
Do you think I do it because I want to?
I have no choice.

324
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:55,070
I know. I also know that if you hang
around Hui Yeong you might be able to go to college,

325
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:58,200
but I don't like you doing that.

326
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,780
- I don't like seeing my boyfriend act like that!
- So what should I do?

327
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,540
You know how my family's doing.

328
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:08,400
How else can I receive such expensive
tutoring in my subjects right now?

329
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,840
How could I get into the prep class
if I don't do what Hui Yeong asks?

330
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,440
I like being with Hui Yeong.

331
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:26,860
I'm sorry, So Ye. I wasn't going to say it like...
I said it wrong.

332
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:29,130
Then make a choice.

333
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:33,880
Are you my boyfriend, or Ma Hui Yeong's butler?

334
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:53,220
Why are you coming so late?

335
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,750
Sorry.

336
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:20,490
Go. I said, go.

337
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:23,420
- Don't go.
- No. Don't even look back.

338
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,690
Don't go.

339
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:27,880
You can keep trying.

340
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:31,930
Starting now, it's going to be tough.

341
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,750
Today, you're going to be drawing your friends.

342
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,420
Draw the person in front of you.
Everyone has a partner, right?

343
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,340
- Yes.
- Yes.

344
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:43,210
First outline the major features

345
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:47,680
and next, the details of the eyes, nose, and lips.

346
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,760
Okay. That's a little too far.

347
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:55,790
If you keep looking,

348
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:59,200
you'll be able to see where in their face
goes in and where it comes out.

349
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,670
Look at your friends face carefully and draw it.

350
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:16,220
♬ This night is passing by quickly ♬

351
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:19,820
♬ And I'm okay with that ♬

352
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,780
Hey turn your head for a second.

353
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:34,670
♬ I'm crying all of a sudden ♬

354
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:39,300
♬ And my tears are dripping ♬

355
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:43,920
♬ If I knew this is what it feels ♬

356
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:48,900
♬ To miss someone ♬

357
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,390
- Hello.
- Hello.

358
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:12,180
- By any chance, are you Yi Young?
- You're Yoon So Hee?

359
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:16,320
Oh, yes.

360
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:26,140
I have to drive a lot because of my work.

361
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,990
But I hurt my arm like this, so...

362
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:31,200
It must have hurt.

363
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,260
It looks swollen still.

364
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:36,520
Our housekeeper has gone on vacation, too,

365
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,180
so I was thinking it would be good to have someone
help take care of the house as well, but...

366
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:46,110
I see. The restaurant which I'm a partner
in is also being remodeled.

367
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:50,090
So I was looking for a part-time job
thinking it's useless to not do anything.

368
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:53,650
But the timeframe is perfect, so I was happy.

369
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:58,030
But still, this can't be, right?

370
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,780
Right.

371
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:06,180
I have to go to a meeting, so I'll leave first.

372
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:09,340
Yes. I'll leave after I finish this.

373
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,860
Okay.

374
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,180
Thank you.

375
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,800
Good-bye.

376
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,470
Have they taken out the interest on my loan yet?

377
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:32,330
Why aren't they picking up?

378
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:15,670
Do you want me to get your car out, too?

379
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:18,950
Yeah. I'm on my way to the meeting with the blockchain group.

380
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:22,890
Why is the UI so lacking on the design draft?

381
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:27,570
Who is going to hire us at this rate?

382
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:33,360
Anyway, we're not going to talk about the specifics
at the meeting today, so send me a new design.

383
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:01,520
You drive well.

384
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,770
It's exactly ten minutes to.

385
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:09,490
Thank you.

386
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:12,330
- I'll park it and go.
- Okay.

387
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:15,060
- Thank you.
- Yes.

388
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:24,070
You won't even let me pay you.

389
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:26,560
Oh, no. We're both mothers.

390
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,480
Thank you.

391
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,700
Yes. Then have a great day.

392
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,110
Yes.

393
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,780
Call me.

394
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:00,190
The wind is even hot.

395
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,270
Come on! It's sticky!

396
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,750
Wait for me.

397
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:06,800
I had stuff to do, head of study.

398
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,610
But you still got done quick.

399
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:10,420
Where's So Ye and Ro Mi?

400
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,850
So Ye's in dance class.

401
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:15,600
Ro Mi is... I guess she's doing stuff by herself.

402
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,240
But still, you should have taken care of her.

403
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,130
No, she's irritating.

404
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:23,130
So hot.

405
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:24,980
Soo Bin.

406
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,840
We're a little busy at the moment.

407
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:31,090
I'm busy, too, but let's talk.

408
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:36,460
We will go ahead.

409
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,610
Fighting.

410
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:47,030
I was curious about what I did wrong.

411
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:51,570
I'm sure I did something wrong
to make you act like this.

412
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:55,260
Was it because I left when I saw your mother coming?

413
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,740
I thought about it a lot.

414
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:05,180
And that seems to be the most probable as to what I did wrong.

415
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:07,250
It's not like that.

416
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:10,450
When I met your mother in front of your house before,

417
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:15,210
she seemed displeased with me.

418
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:19,530
So that's why I didn't stay around to say hello.

419
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:26,440
I think that might have bothered you.

420
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:32,530
Next time, no matter what your mothers says,
I'll say hello confidently.

421
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:35,410
- And—
- It's nothing like that.

422
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:41,990
Just, it became burdensome to be dating someone.

423
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:48,840
While watching a movie, suddenly?

424
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:57,280
While watching a movie, suddenly.

425
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:02,460
Why? Why suddenly?

426
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,400
Could it be true?

427
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,510
Did he really use me?

428
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:16,820
The movie was a mistake, making you feel burdened.

429
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:22,170
But still, if you think of something, let me know at any time.

430
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:25,180
What I did wrong.

431
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,880
I'll correct it.

432
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:38,200
This.

433
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:42,910
I was going to give it to you that day.

434
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,350
Mom.

435
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:24,920
- Oh.
- When did you get here?

436
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,470
Just a little while ago.

437
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:30,380
I'm going to stay with you for now.
They're remodeling the eatery.

438
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,060
Really?

439
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,400
You're happy, right? Right?

440
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,590
Of course, I am.
This hasn't happened a lot in the past.

441
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,900
But what is all this?

442
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,400
Oh, I was organizing our old things.

443
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,570
We have to throw out what we don't need!

444
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:50,650
It's too disorganized.

445
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:54,800
Yeah. But you'll end up not being able to
throw anything away saying you're attached to them.

446
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:59,520
It's not true.
I'm really going to throw things out this time. Really.

447
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:06,480
What? It was here!

448
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,590
Oh! Oh my god!

449
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,910
How is it?

450
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:14,940
It's pretty.

451
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:19,090
I wore it for my first date when I was 18.

452
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:23,080
- With Dad?
- Yes.

453
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:29,240
It's the same but I've changed.

454
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:37,740
It's a 30% sale, but still expensive.

455
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,310
Are you Teacher Oh Han Gyeol?

456
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:43,520
Yes.

457
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,410
What is this?

458
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:49,430
Excuse me. What is this?

459
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:51,330
Hello?

460
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:58,970
What is it?

461
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,700
What is this? What?

462
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:20,640
Teacher Oh, this way.

463
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,620
Yes.

464
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,120
- Sit down.
-Yes.

465
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:35,420
Ma'am, I am very flustered.

466
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,990
Do you see me sweating?

467
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:43,810
Let's pretend this didn't happen.

468
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:49,660
Teacher Oh, you're quite hard to figure out.

469
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:53,080
Are you innocent or pretending to be?

470
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,490
No, I am not innocent.

471
00:40:55,490 --> 00:41:01,200
But, this is unrelated to being innocent.

472
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,320
Ma'am, doing this will not benefit Hui Yeong at all.

473
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:10,400
Hui Yeong is doing fine on his own.
So if you trust and wait for him—

474
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,160
Teacher Oh.
Why are you so fastidious?

475
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,080
I really can't understand.

476
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,650
Can't we just pass over this smoothly?

477
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:28,930
By any chance, did you do the same to Teacher Kim,

478
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:31,900
his previous homeroom teacher?

479
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:38,240
If he did, then this is a very serious situation

480
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,200
So what?
Because you're curious about these petty things

481
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,880
you've been repeatedly contacting
the old homeroom teacher?

482
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,720
What are you trying to dig up?

483
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,840
Did Teacher Kim agree to this?

484
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,620
I have a favor, Teacher Oh.

485
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:59,430
Until my Hui Yeong gets accepted
into Seoul University, please!

486
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:02,860
Stay quiet, please?

487
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:06,020
Because of your simple way of thinking,

488
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:10,550
I can't even fathom what will happen to my Hui Yeong.

489
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:13,250
I beg of you. Please?

490
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:17,800
You understand what I am saying, right?

491
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:22,080
How offensive.

492
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:28,970
What does she see me as?

493
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,020
I would like to order.

494
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,680
This is such a disgusting world.

495
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:48,310
How could I fail again?

496
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:09,120
See? It's not bad.

497
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:12,310
Since we're drinking together, you feel less lonely
(Korean: hangyul).

498
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:17,380
Oh! Hangyul and my name Han Gyeol.

499
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:21,840
That's the name my mom gave me.

500
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:25,130
She wanted me to act consistently,

501
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:32,860
so she named me like that.

502
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:36,270
Mom

503
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:41,110
My mom's only suffering in the countryside.

504
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,810
I'm sorry, Mom. I failed again

505
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:01,080
Don't cry.

506
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,200
I'm a bad child.

507
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,160
No, I'm worse.

508
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,850
No, you're not.

509
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:13,490
Mom, how could you have such a bad son?

510
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,300
- Are you okay, sir?
- I'm fine.

511
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,230
I called a taxi. Hold on a moment.

512
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:23,390
I will take you home.

513
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:26,300
No, it's fine. Stay here for a bit.

514
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,350
Why isn't it coming?

515
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:35,100
It's here. The taxi is here. It's here.

516
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,500
I will take you home.

517
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,800
- Here. Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah.

518
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:40,870
I'm really fine.

519
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:43,070
No, no.

520
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:46,380
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

521
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:48,520
I'm fine, I'm fine.

522
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,660
- You go first.
- Hurry up and get in.

523
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:54,610
Where was your house?

524
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:57,430
Deulae Apartments on Cheonbongsan Street.

525
00:44:57,430 --> 00:45:00,180
Deulae Apartments. Please take care of him well, sir!

526
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,110
Goodbye.

527
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:05,580
Goodbye.

528
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:08,810
Soo Bin's mom.

529
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:12,560
This is seriously annoying.

530
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:16,680
Why am I getting annoyed?
It's not like I didn't know.

531
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:19,860
I don't even have the right to be pissed.

532
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:25,560
Mom. Can't you just rest?
How did you drive with your arm like that?

533
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,350
I found a part-timer. A driver.

534
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:30,990
She'll also do household chores.

535
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:33,360
What?

536
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,450
It turned out well.

537
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,340
Hold on.

538
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,480
What is this? Am I a kid?

539
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,990
This is also a good memory.

540
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:52,660
There's a kid in my class who can draw this well.

541
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:54,790
Then he should go to art school.

542
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,450
Is there something you're worried about?

543
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,340
No.

544
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:06,080
- Mom.
- Yeah.

545
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,170
Was your first love Dad?

546
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:12,720
Yes, when I was 18.

547
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:19,440
I guess first loves end that insignificantly.

548
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:25,030
Look at you! How is it insignificant?
First loves are amazing.

549
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:28,260
That is, um, when you're walking down the street

550
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:33,510
and someone splashes a bucket of water on you.

551
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:40,010
That's how the feelings of first love attack you.

552
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:42,830
You completely forget who you were before.

553
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:45,850
You got splashed by the water. Hey.

554
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:49,380
The forced transfer kid in your class.
The good-looking one.

555
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,890
Is he still in the same team as you?
The performance assessment?

556
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:53,670
♬ It is blindingly bright. ♬

557
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:55,010
No.

558
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:59,350
We finished.

559
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:00,470
It's good that it ended.

560
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:04,310
♬ I carefully say goodbye ♬

561
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,030
♬ with feeling ♬

562
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:11,060
What's that?

563
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:12,670
Peas.

564
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:16,550
Since from then on, you're not
the same person you were before,

565
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:19,500
the person you were when you didn't know them.

566
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:24,260
I want to return to that time.

567
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:30,530
I met your father too quickly and broke up with him, but

568
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:32,420
I don't regret it.

569
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:35,170
That's what first love is.

570
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,490
What am I saying in front of you?

571
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:45,160
We're done! Joon Woo, wash your hands and go to bed.

572
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,860
We did it really fast

573
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:56,390
Looking back, I don't remember it either,
the me before I met Soo Bin.

574
00:47:57,590 --> 00:48:00,580
Excuse me! Checkered Shirt.

575
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,730
Are you okay?

576
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:12,110
Since I wasn't myself starting from back then.

577
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:20,230
Where did I put it? Ugh.

578
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:23,090
My insides feel sick.

579
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,460
I'm handsome.

580
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:28,900
Hold on a second. Where is my bag?

581
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:31,590
My bag. Where's my bag.

582
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:35,580
My bag...

583
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:49,190
It'd be nice if I could drive you
but I'd feel sorry for the driver.

584
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:51,860
It's fine. This is better.

585
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:55,150
Then you didn't like me driving you?

586
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:57,420
Come on, that's not what I meant.

587
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:59,610
I'll go. Mom, fighting!

588
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:01,270
Yes.

589
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:03,290
So funny.

590
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:10,160
Study hard. Keep your head on straight.

591
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:19,840
Hello.

592
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,280
Were you hiding there?

593
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:25,610
Yes, I felt I should.

594
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:30,160
I brought some young radish kimchi.
If you keep it in a kimchi fridge, it'll be good.

595
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,640
- A kimchi fridge?
- Yep!

596
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,640
You didn't have to.

597
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:02,630
You two are still like this?

598
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,620
Next period is math, right?

599
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,500
I guess it's still going on.

600
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,330
What is this?

601
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:23,700
- What's this?
- Whoa!

602
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,320
Who did this?

603
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:29,030
- What's with this? The wire...
- Hey.

604
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:30,830
You'll get hurt.

605
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:33,640
Yeah.

606
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:48,420
- What's that?
- What?

607
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,150
What do you want?

608
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:53,010
I'm sorry. It slipped.

609
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:56,340
The one who hid my math book,
made it so I couldn't open my bag,

610
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:58,730
and the one that placed a bug on my meal tray,
they were all you, right?

611
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:01,580
Me? No.

612
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:03,310
Because of Hwang Ro Mi?

613
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,100
It's not.

614
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:08,970
Then you should make an effort so that
Ro Mi will like you instead of being like this to me.

615
00:51:08,970 --> 00:51:13,900
How? Ro Mi only has her eyes fixed
on you so what do you want me to do?

616
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:20,110
Choi Joon Woo, I truly hate you.

617
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:21,460
Go! You go and transfer!

618
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:24,570
Go right now! Go!

619
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:29,170
You're laughing.
This jerk is laughing!

620
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:31,050
You're laughing!

621
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:33,250
That jerk is laughing! Jerk!

622
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:34,900
You dare laugh!

623
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:38,590
Now, I have good news that I will deliver to everyone.

624
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:45,090
The school trip that we have all been waiting for is finally here.

625
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:52,720
- Kids, aren't you happy about it?
- Math.

626
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:56,730
Not math but a school trip.
Trip, so we are going for two nights and three days.

627
00:51:56,730 --> 00:51:59,320
- I like it!
- Such a hassle.

628
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:02,460
- Can we not go?
- Not going isn't an option.

629
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:05,280
This is also a continuation of class.

630
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:09,950
The class president and vice president
should plan out the schedule. Okay?

631
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:11,560
Yes.

632
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:18,390
You all probably know this from the freshman field trip, right?
I think there's no need to waste time.

633
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:23,970
Every class will have a talent show and those who love to dance should prepare for it. Pil Sang put your hand down.

634
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:26,370
It's a long-awaited school trip though.

635
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:30,390
I think it would be nice to prepare for it like a memorable event.

636
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,110
Joon Woo, the final exam and
performance assessments are coming up.

637
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:39,820
And the mock exams too.
Let's not waste our energy on nonsense.

638
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:49,510
Then, how about those who want
to have a fun school trip plan for it?

639
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:53,320
Well,not someone who finds it a waste of time.

640
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,130
That sounds good.

641
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,510
I agree!

642
00:52:56,510 --> 00:52:58,290
Me too!

643
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:02,940
Well, that's okay.

644
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:07,350
Then those who agree with Joon Woo
will remain and the rest can go.

645
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:09,090
How about that?

646
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:23,500
Soo Bin, thank you for staying.

647
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,950
Ro Mi, aren't you going to the study group?

648
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:33,180
Yeah, I want to stay.

649
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:35,120
Me too!

650
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:40,690
It's the one and only school trip so let's join. Okay.

651
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:43,950
Don't go.

652
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:46,410
It's time for our study group.

653
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:57,110
Lee Gi Tae.

654
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,690
Don't go.

655
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,790
Right, don't go.

656
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:11,770
Gi Tae, let's do it together.
You are the assistant leader for student life.

657
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:22,500
I'm sorry.

658
00:54:47,590 --> 00:54:49,500
Should we all gather up?

659
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:54,470
To be unique, how about we wear hanbok?

660
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:55,960
Traditional clothes.

661
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:59,760
Won't the principal love that concept?

662
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,760
Are we doing a 60th feast or what?

663
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:07,690
I think it would be nice if we could all wear something together.

664
00:55:07,690 --> 00:55:09,580
That sounds nice.

665
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:11,850
I think it sounds okay.

666
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:19,690
How about this?

667
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,580
Finding old clothes at home and wearing them.

668
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:27,090
I wore this when I was 18 during my first date.

669
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:31,400
Clothes with memories that our parents wore.

670
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:35,890
That sounds good.
What should I wear?

671
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:38,390
Retro cosplay?

672
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:41,500
Right?

673
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:45,090
Oh Je wear something cool.

674
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:46,350
Yeah.

675
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:48,430
What's retro?

676
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:49,830
It's English.

677
00:55:49,830 --> 00:55:50,900
You prepare for it.

678
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:53,520
Our assistant's idea is good.

679
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,290
Good.

680
00:55:56,610 --> 00:56:01,550
It would be really pretty if we all wear it together.

681
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:03,560
It would be really pretty.

682
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:04,870
So pretty.

683
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:07,690
- It would be pretty.
- Thanks.

684
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:17,490
Last time she already got off work so she should still be here.

685
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:35,090
Hello.

686
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:43,350
Teach.

687
00:56:43,350 --> 00:56:46,020
Hey, Joon Woo, you are already working.

688
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:49,310
The noona who worked the shift
before mine told me she had things to do.

689
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:55,050
Is that so?

690
00:56:56,620 --> 00:57:00,810
Do you have something you want to tell me?

691
00:57:00,810 --> 00:57:03,770
Yeah.

692
00:57:03,770 --> 00:57:06,430
I heard you did well with the meeting
with the other kids. Retro...

693
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:09,850
That... cosplay.

694
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,270
Well, you didn't have to come for that.

695
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:18,190
I am so proud so I want to give you a hug.

696
00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:19,930
That's why I came.

697
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:22,540
Here.

698
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:24,870
Right.

699
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:38,080
Hui Young, are you done with the study group?

700
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:42,250
I studied a bit after it ended. Why are you here?

701
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:45,720
Just... it's cool.

702
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:53,040
But the school trip event, can't we do it together?

703
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:56,550
I think it's quite a topic among the classes.

704
00:57:56,550 --> 00:58:00,330
If you win they will give the class another air purifier.

705
00:58:00,330 --> 00:58:03,220
And they will give gift certificates to each person.

706
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:08,800
I think it will be good for the whole class to join
since we were the ones who came up with the idea.

707
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:12,030
You are our class president.

708
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:18,680
Okay.

709
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:21,990
Do whatever you like.

710
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:26,260
If you grant my wish.

711
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,540
We always came here when we were in elementary school.

712
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:34,450
After tutoring, behind our moms' backs.

713
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:39,430
We did.
And we got totally scolded when we got caught.

714
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:42,480
But this game is still here.

715
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:43,530
Right.

716
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:46,430
- Should we give it a try?
- Yeah.

717
00:58:46,430 --> 00:58:48,050
Here we go.

718
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:51,080
Here.

719
00:59:05,870 --> 00:59:08,930
Ma Hui Young what are you doing?
You are going to get scolded when you get caught.

720
00:59:08,930 --> 00:59:10,890
Just go.

721
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:20,930
What now? I told you to go.

722
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:23,230
I don't want to.

723
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:29,130
My dad said that I should just sit beside my friend who is sad.

724
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:30,760
without saying a word.

725
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:34,110
That is carrying their burden with them.

726
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:39,270
Soo Bin.

727
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,630
I'm happy.

728
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:54,630
Just, it's become burdensome to date someone.

729
00:59:55,450 --> 00:59:59,590
While watching a movie, all of a sudden.

730
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:18,730
This thought suddenly came to me.

731
01:00:18,730 --> 01:00:24,330
You... really liked me a lot.

732
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:31,150
That's why, even the message that Choi Joon Woo sent,

733
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:33,890
you showed it to me.

734
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,530
Even though you know I would be distraught.

735
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:48,540
Could it possibly be momentary jealousy?

736
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:55,860
I'm sorry.

737
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:59,170
I just...

738
01:00:59,170 --> 01:01:03,560
I'm sorry too since I made you say that.

739
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:07,390
We are longtime friends, though.
Very close ones.

740
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:20,640
Hey. The playground has changed so much.

741
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:24,290
When we were young it was just a sandlot.

742
01:01:24,290 --> 01:01:26,840
The world has become so nice. Right?

743
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:33,040
I'm off.

744
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:38,260
You. We are doing the school trip
event together since I granted your wish.

745
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:40,950
I'm going. See you later.

746
01:01:57,030 --> 01:01:59,530
So unbelievable.

747
01:01:59,530 --> 01:02:03,770
What is this?
I barely walked you home.

748
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:06,510
Next time. I will give you a chance.

749
01:02:06,510 --> 01:02:10,180
Never mind. There are no more chances.

750
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:11,940
Go on.

751
01:02:13,810 --> 01:02:15,700
Soo Bin.

752
01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:19,100
That...

753
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,620
That...

754
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:25,190
Huh?

755
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:33,790
The truth is, that message, you see...

756
01:02:33,790 --> 01:02:35,580
Soo Bin.

757
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:44,460
No matter how I think about it, I think that isn't right.

758
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:47,990
Being pressured all of a sudden in the middle of a movie.

759
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,770
What's with you, Choi Joon Woo? At this time?

760
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:56,850
I think there certainly is a misunderstanding.

761
01:02:57,670 --> 01:03:02,330
Because... your eyes tell me otherwise.

762
01:03:05,890 --> 01:03:07,720
What is it?

763
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:15,100
Later.

764
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:22,490
Soo Bin.

765
01:03:22,490 --> 01:03:24,900
Soo Bin says she doesn't want to say it.

766
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:29,180
Ma Hui Young, butt out.

767
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,780
Soo Bin.

768
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:40,500
You should go in, Soo Bin.
I will send him away.

769
01:03:56,690 --> 01:03:59,030
And you believed that?

770
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:03,000
More than me?

771
01:04:09,990 --> 01:04:11,960
I see.

772
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:26,100
I did it all because of you.
I will explain everything.

773
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:57,680
♬ I sometimes think of it ♬

774
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:04,070
♬ Some of those days and nights ♬

775
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:12,640
♬ I think I may be able to reach it now ♬

776
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,190
♬ I smile ♬

777
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:17,360
Moment of Eighteen
~ Preview ~

778
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:20,600
Oh Je, do you know where Choi Joon Woo's house is?

779
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:23,660
Aren't you even sorry towards Soo Bin?

780
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:25,170
You just hurt her.

781
01:05:25,170 --> 01:05:27,060
I think I would need time.

782
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:30,020
Just don't take so long. I'm sorry.

783
01:05:30,020 --> 01:05:33,100
Hui Young, I wish you would give it some thought

784
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:35,050
what your feelings toward me are.

785
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:38,380
You must be busy but you came all the way to the school.

786
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:40,560
That... Ms. Ji Min.

787
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:42,410
Since we are doing this,

788
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:43,290
let's go for first place!

789
01:05:43,290 --> 01:05:45,230
Two people.

790
01:05:45,230 --> 01:05:49,130
The next stage is Go Dong... Is that Joon Woo?

791
01:05:49,130 --> 01:05:52,930
♬ I work hard ♬

792
01:05:52,930 --> 01:05:56,680
♬ So you won't go ♬

793
01:05:58,530 --> 01:06:05,170
♬ The memories that became distant ♬
