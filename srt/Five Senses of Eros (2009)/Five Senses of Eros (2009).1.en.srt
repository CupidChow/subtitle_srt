1
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,520
Five Senses of Eros

2
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,520
Why there?

3
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,490
Why can't it be
a romantic place?

4
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:55,490
It's Friday night and
the traffic is bumper to bumper.

5
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,430
It had to be downtown
during rush hour?

6
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:04,120
So we could come up
with excuses...

7
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,760
...for standing somebody up
at the last minute?

8
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,650
Hello?

9
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,290
It's freezing.

10
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,220
Why don't we pick
a place to go?

11
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,160
"We"?

12
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,560
May I have
your attention, please?

13
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:56,990
A KTX bound for Busan
at 7130...

14
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,390
Hello?
Yes, boss.

15
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:11,090
I'm at the train station
to go to Busan.

16
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,630
I'll take care of it.

17
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,120
Yes. Okay.

18
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,750
The opening ceremony footage
should be finished by today.

19
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,780
I'll have KIM deal with it.

20
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,820
We're moving to the reception
after the opening ceremony.

21
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,390
We might have issues
with security.

22
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:56,620
It's too far to walk,
and too close to use vehicles.

23
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,060
Beautiful legs.

24
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,090
A buddy of mine got
married recently.

25
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,260
He met his wife on a place
coming back...

26
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,920
...from a business trip
in Tokyo.

27
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,860
For those traveling alone...

28
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,660
...a seat number is like
a lottery number.

29
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,920
As soon as somebody
sits next to you...

30
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,460
...you'll know what you won.

31
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,220
A formal suit
of good quality.

32
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,390
The balance of black and brown.

33
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:48,320
Her job must involve dealing
with upscale customers.

34
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,820
Shades on her head in winter...

35
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:58,050
She doesn't care
about what others think.

36
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,060
Or she cares too much
about how she looks.

37
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:09,020
What arouses men the most?

38
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,390
For some, it's long legs
in sexy stockings.

39
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,460
Or a firm ass in a tight skirt.

40
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,750
For others,
it's long fingers holding a pen.

41
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,960
Or unpainted fingernails.

42
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:28,360
Or the movement of eyes
reading something.

43
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,950
Shouldn't you know
your SSN by heart?

44
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,290
What?

45
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:54,960
It's a business
registration number.

46
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,220
For tax purposes...

47
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,950
On a business trip?

48
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,320
Yes. To Busan.

49
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:12,120
What am I doing?

50
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,560
I tell my friends
a conversation with girls...

51
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,090
...should always end
with a question.

52
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,690
You know what?

53
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,350
Thanks for earlier.

54
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,920
Where are you going?

55
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,390
There you go.

56
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,990
To Cheonan.

57
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,390
Oh, I see.

58
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:40,630
That's all I have to say?
"Oh, I see"?

59
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,920
Two coffees, please.

60
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,160
I got this for you.

61
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,350
Sorry.
I don't drink coffee.

62
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,360
Okay.

63
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,860
Just one.

64
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:24,190
We're arriving
in Cheonan shortly.

65
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,120
Already?

66
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,960
Speed and romance
never go together.

67
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,820
Now it's time to check
my lottery ticket.

68
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,950
Be a man and go after her.

69
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,730
Only the brave win
the beauty.

70
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:58,920
No, I'm a highly
educated man.

71
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,720
Think of the opportunity cost.

72
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,990
If I'm late for the meeting,
I'm screwed.

73
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:11,120
Be reasonable.

74
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,020
It was the reason that led
Era of Romanticism.

75
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,120
Excuse me?

76
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,400
Excuse me?

77
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,920
Forget it.
What shall I do now?

78
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:31,360
I thought you were
going to Busan.

79
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,690
When are you doing it?

80
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:40,350
I mean going back
to Seoul.

81
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:41,920
Hold on.

82
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,260
Hello?

83
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,780
Freudian Slip.

84
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,120
This is a perfect example.

85
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,260
"When are you doing it?"
I'm helpless.

86
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,490
How embarrassing.

87
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:01,780
I told you about that
at the meeting. No.

88
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,420
Hold on a second.

89
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,530
What I meant to say is...

90
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,050
Here's what.

91
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:19,530
Give me a call
when you know what to say.

92
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,990
Are you there?

93
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,920
Hungry?
It's almost done.

94
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,920
I hope you like it.

95
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,090
Okay.

96
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,990
It looks good.

97
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:01,990
A marriage. It's a social consent
for a couple to have sex.

98
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,660
You're here.

99
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,660
Yeah.

100
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,560
You said you were busy.

101
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,650
I've come for her food.

102
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,990
I tried this wine in Italy
after the film festival.

103
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,360
Brunello di Montalcino.
It's really good.

104
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,450
Brunello?

105
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,550
Do you like wine?

106
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,750
No, I only drink Soju.

107
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,520
- Tell me.
- What?

108
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,490
When will I have a nephew?

109
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,760
Shut up and eat.

110
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,590
It'll ruin her body.

111
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,580
You're unbelievable.

112
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,690
When will I have
a sister-in-law?

113
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,130
So you can slave her?

114
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:54,060
Sure.
Why not?

115
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,620
Are you seeing anybody?

116
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,290
No. I'm not...

117
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:08,030
It tastes weird.

118
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,990
Good for me.

119
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,720
It's kind of flat.

120
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,590
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

121
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,190
I mean...

122
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,430
There's no taste to it.

123
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:30,790
Do you think
it's the ingredients?

124
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:02,890
Hello?

125
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,030
Hello?

126
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:04,990
Yes?

127
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,690
Hold on a second.

128
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:21,190
What I mean to say is...

129
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,790
Here's what.

130
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:28,160
Call me when you know
what to say.

131
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,430
Okay.

132
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,990
What a ﬂop.

133
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,020
Should I back down?

134
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,990
Or what?
What else can I do?

135
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:47,960
Oh, the brave don't
win the beauty.

136
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,760
They just miss the train.

137
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:59,260
No, give up.
Don't go after her.

138
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:04,320
Damn my body!
It's moving on its own.

139
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,720
Don't talk to her.
Don't!

140
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,830
Excuse me?

141
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,950
Forget it.
What shall I do now?

142
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:21,290
If I wanna call you...

143
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,090
...when I know what to say.

144
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,720
I need your number.

145
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,290
Wow, it worked.

146
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,430
A curator?

147
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,190
I don't know
if you remember me.

148
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:04,620
We met on a train.
And you gave me your number.

149
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,960
Sorry I didn't...

150
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,530
Why is he out there?
It's cold.

151
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:12,520
Let me tell him.

152
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,320
In front of
Galleria Dept. Store?

153
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:21,260
Which one?
It has two buildings.

154
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,690
All right. Okay.

155
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,060
Hello?

156
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,750
Hello?

157
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:37,190
It's freezing.
Why don't we pick a place to go?

158
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,330
"Well begun is half done."
Such a romantic saying.

159
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,130
Do you like wine?

160
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,560
Do I like wine?
I love it.

161
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,260
Which one do you like?

162
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:01,260
Pick one.
Something not too dry.

163
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,960
The only wine
that I know is...

164
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,320
Do you have Brunello
from Italy?

165
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:14,020
We do have it,
but it's a bit pricey.

166
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,090
Recommend me
something else quickly.

167
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,390
Can I recommend
something else?

168
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,520
Sure.

169
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,720
Try Rene Barbier.
It's good.

170
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,790
And on sale.

171
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,590
Damn it.
You had to say that?

172
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,060
Brunello, please.

173
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:46,360
Filled the glass too much
and drank it too quickly.

174
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:49,990
Bull made sure
I kept my pinky lifted...

175
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,860
...when I held the glass.

176
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:56,220
What did you go to
Busan for?

177
00:14:56,590 --> 00:15:02,690
An IOC meeting will be held
there next month.

178
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:07,090
What's important here is...

179
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,630
...how to make my job
sound more interesting...

180
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,320
...instead of boring her
with what I really do.

181
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:20,990
Who I am is less important
than how she views me.

182
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:24,830
My ego might feel betrayed...

183
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,890
...as its existence is
completely denied...

184
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:30,550
...by the untruthful master.

185
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,390
What a philosophical night.

186
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:37,560
What show are you
working on?

187
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,260
A photographer named
Blare Kitchener.

188
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,350
I don't think
you know him.

189
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,060
A chance!
Oh, he focuses on human relationships...

190
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,430
...in pure and innocent state...

191
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:54,360
...without any images
covering them?

192
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,520
No?

193
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,490
Am I wrong?

194
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,490
No, you're not.

195
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:16,320
But I could tell
you just memorized it.

196
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,890
Frankly... I know nothing
about a modern art.

197
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,190
I know you got that
from our website.

198
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,350
I wrote it.

199
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:36,660
God, I got caught
red-handed.

200
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,450
He does models
in ads or magazines...

201
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,860
...without any accessories
worn on them.

202
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,450
Just their faces.

203
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:52,290
So people can see them
for what they are.

204
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:56,360
To save the human nature...

205
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:59,260
That's right. You're good.

206
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:06,820
Should we try it?

207
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,220
What?

208
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:26,560
My favorite season
is summer.

209
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,660
Ding-dong-dang-

210
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:32,220
It's my turn.

211
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,850
My favorite color is red.

212
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:40,330
Your tie is red.

213
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,720
So is your muffler.

214
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:48,850
I don't really like red.

215
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,720
But a red tie for a suit is
often an easy choice.

216
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:00,960
I prefer Korean food
to pastas.

217
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:08,480
I prefer dramas
to action flicks.

218
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:18,830
I would choose work
over love.

219
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:26,520
I like her lips.
Neither too fat nor thin.

220
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:30,320
I...

221
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:35,620
I fell in love at hello
on a train.

222
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,590
Ditto.

223
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:01,390
I like steamed crabs.

224
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:09,230
I don't like them.

225
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:14,020
My mom always
made a crab stew.

226
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,520
I like it that way.

227
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,620
Either way, it's crabs.

228
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,350
I Still don't like it.

229
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:31,590
Al right.
Let's go somewhere else.

230
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,350
Come on.

231
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:40,850
- Did you like the wine?
- Absolutely.

232
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,520
Hey. Me?

233
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,390
I'm on a date.

234
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,990
My colleague is in Amsterdam
on business.

235
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,360
A computer file she had
had been broken.

236
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,650
It won't take long.

237
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:22,560
Amsterdam...
What a lovely town.

238
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,060
If she were in New York...

239
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:29,580
...she might not have
asked her for help.

240
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:50,120
I'm out of wine.
ls cognac ok?

241
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:53,290
It doesn't matter.

242
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,190
A good view, isn't it?

243
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,660
My friend and I rented it
for a studio.

244
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,390
After she got married,
I kept it for myself.

245
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,790
Give me 30 minutes.

246
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,620
Don't mind me.
Go ahead.

247
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,160
I'm sorry.

248
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:31,260
She puts her hair in a bun
and starts working.

249
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:40,550
He looks out the window,
drinking cognac.

250
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,550
Watching the city
lit with colorful lights...

251
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:51,890
...he sees her reflection
in the window.

252
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,990
What would be happening
in other parts of the city?

253
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:07,820
Meeting somebody...
Falling in love...

254
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:11,620
Feeling comfortable...
Falling asleep...

255
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,120
Falling asleep...

256
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:20,690
Cognac is quite strong.

257
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,060
As gently as possible.

258
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,360
Not too much tongue.

259
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,020
Those rules mean nothing
at this moment.

260
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:59,420
What will this kiss lead to?

261
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:02,230
No answer is needed.

262
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:09,090
I just kiss. Therefore I am.

263
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,990
Two people being one...

264
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,890
If it's her that I like...

265
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,950
...not sex itself,
...it can be called love.

266
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:45,960
I like her love handle.

267
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:52,730
That! have my hands on it
is a sign of love.

268
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:59,560
We're exploring each other
through the five senses.

269
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:04,020
A human relationship
in its pure state...

270
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,760
...without any images
covering it.

271
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,930
What a philosophical night.

272
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:12,890
I can'! believe
what I did.

273
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:34,660
A stranger is asleep
in my bed.

274
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:40,360
Was I too aggressive?

275
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:46,180
Look at this chiseled face.

276
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,750
So handsome.

277
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:55,350
And cute.

278
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,690
A goatee grew overnight.

279
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:10,060
His beautiful voice
comes from here?

280
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:16,080
He's sleeping
as if nothing happened.

281
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,560
Can he be thinking
what I'm thinking?

282
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:41,560
Me, I'm Here

283
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,750
"ye-um?

284
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,490
I'm home, Hye-lim.

285
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:08,820
Is she in the room?

286
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,220
Hye-lim?

287
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,450
All the lights are on.

288
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,560
Did she go out?

289
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:20,290
Hye-lim?

290
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,860
I missed you!

291
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,790
How are you, babe?

292
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,620
Let me dry your hair.
Turn around.

293
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:43,990
Like this.

294
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:54,290
We shouldn't.

295
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,620
Okay.

296
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:02,390
Put it down a bit.

297
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:08,620
- Stop it.
- You're so adorable.

298
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,930
Okay, okay.

299
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:21,560
When do you find me sexy?

300
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:28,050
When you're in your birthday suit.

301
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,760
When are you happy?

302
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:46,220
When you hold me
in your birthday suit.

303
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,620
I wanna do it.

304
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:24,820
I wanna do it all the way.

305
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:22,290
No.

306
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:53,950
Hye-lim, look at me.

307
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:03,150
The doctor said we shouldn't.

308
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:07,090
You know that.

309
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:22,690
For over 4 days?

310
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:30,160
How much do I get
for the surgery?

311
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,820
I'll call you back
when the document is ready.

312
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:45,320
Okay. bye.

313
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,050
"ye-um?

314
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,290
Hey-lim?

315
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,760
Are you here?

316
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:00,860
Hye-lim?

317
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,450
Hye-lim?

318
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,720
There you are.

319
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:58,220
Why'd you stop looking
for me?

320
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,620
You won't look for me
anymore?

321
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,060
Hye-lim?

322
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,250
Hye-lim?

323
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,820
Where is she? Hye-lim?

324
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:18,690
There you are.

325
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,790
You'll be okay.
Don't be scared.

326
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,190
Wanna take your PJs?

327
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:59,260
I won't need them.

328
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,750
It feels as if we were going
on a trip.

329
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:20,850
I'll take this.

330
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,990
What about the lipstick?

331
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:31,580
I won't be able to shower,
and I don't wanna stink.

332
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,280
Throw in your cologne, too.

333
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,630
So I can smell it
when I miss you.

334
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:52,360
I'll be right by you.
Don't worry.

335
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,950
Let's go.

336
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,790
Hye-lim?

337
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:48,720
Won-sik, how are you?

338
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:53,390
No.

339
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:57,830
It's okay.
I should've called you.

340
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:03,760
Sure, I'm fine.

341
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:11,450
No. I had her cremated.

342
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:22,620
Okay, I'll stay in touch.

343
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,780
Okay. bye.

344
00:50:56,890 --> 00:50:58,120
What's wrong?

345
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:34,630
Damn it!

346
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:35,490
I'm sorry.

347
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,150
- Cut it.
- Cut!

348
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:42,420
Let's redo it.

349
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,060
You strangled me!

350
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:55,530
I'm sorry.

351
00:51:55,830 --> 00:52:00,160
Are you okay?
Mi-jin was too nervous.

352
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:01,760
Let's redo the scene.

353
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,520
I'm so sorry.

354
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:06,560
I'll do better.

355
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,030
Let's redo it.

356
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:17,760
Why'd you get up?

357
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,060
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

358
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,660
I'm sorry.

359
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:36,430
You're my sister.
How could you do this to me?

360
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,690
How-Z?

361
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:42,060
You killed me
and stole my husband!

362
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:47,730
Please, forgive me.

363
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:51,280
I was blinded by lust.

364
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,790
Don't kill me.
Please!

365
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:05,380
Don't kill me.

366
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,120
Cut.

367
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,460
Look real.

368
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:22,820
Real...

369
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:33,460
I was blinded by lust.

370
00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:36,290
Don't kill me.
Please!

371
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:43,120
Cut.

372
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:53,780
We're redoing it.

373
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:57,820
Why?
I thought it was good.

374
00:53:58,230 --> 00:53:59,560
That's...

375
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:02,920
What the hell is this?

376
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:06,050
Nobody messed up
this time!

377
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:10,690
Mi-jin's cry was off.

378
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,350
And the guy moved.

379
00:54:14,930 --> 00:54:18,120
The corpse isn't
supposed to...

380
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,030
Calm down.
We're almost done.

381
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:24,690
He's an internationally
recognized director.

382
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:26,690
He must have reasons.

383
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:30,220
Reasons my ass!

384
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:35,350
Teach her how to act!

385
00:54:35,590 --> 00:54:36,890
Take 31.

386
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:44,090
Forgive me.
I was blinded by lust.

387
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:47,120
Don't kill me.
Please!

388
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:52,730
Cut.

389
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:55,320
My gown!

390
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:20,560
Let's do it again.

391
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:24,080
We're doing another take!

392
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:37,290
I need a break.

393
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,490
I'm sorry.

394
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:42,390
"I'm sorry."
That's all you have to say.

395
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:48,580
Get the room tone.

396
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,650
We're getting the room tone.

397
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,190
Stay still.

398
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:13,120
I'm sorry.
Mi-jin is just nervous.

399
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:16,090
Go easy on her.

400
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:22,250
How long have you been
in this business?

401
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:26,130
About 15 years.

402
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:35,060
It's about time
you should be ripe.

403
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:36,320
What?

404
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:41,360
You don't know
how to deal with a director.

405
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,480
What are you saying?

406
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:49,560
Didn't you see the way
he looks at her?

407
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,550
It's so obvious.

408
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:57,490
He keeps finding fault with her
to get her attention.

409
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:02,990
You fix that,
and everything's good.

410
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,760
It's the balance
of Yin and Yang.

411
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,950
Don't I miss
an unripe guy tonight.

412
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,120
Get out.
I'm getting changed.

413
00:57:33,330 --> 00:57:35,830
To kill or not to kill...

414
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:36,560
Cut.

415
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,690
- To kill or not to kill...
- Cut.

416
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:40,590
To kill or not to kill...

417
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:41,290
Cut.
- To kill...
- Cut.

418
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,200
- Not to kill...
- Cut.

419
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,200
That's the question...

420
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,060
Cut.

421
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:47,390
- That is...
- Action!

422
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,620
Not to kill...

423
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:49,930
Cut.

424
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:51,530
That's the question.

425
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:53,060
To kill or not to kill...

426
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:54,190
Cut.

427
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:59,090
To kill or not to kill,
that is the question.

428
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,190
Cut.

429
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,690
To kill or not to kill...

430
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:06,350
Come on, it stinks!

431
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:08,180
Take 127.

432
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:11,230
Action!

433
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:15,990
To kill or not to kill,
that's is the question.

434
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:17,030
Cut.

435
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:23,830
I know it' hard.

436
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:25,260
No.

437
00:58:25,530 --> 00:58:26,960
Enough for today.

438
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,930
Let me try again.

439
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:32,630
We have other scenes
to shoot.

440
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:34,290
AD?

441
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:37,430
Let's take a break.

442
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:38,590
BONG?

443
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,330
Let's take a break.

444
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:49,320
BONG?
I got this for you.

445
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:52,020
- No thanks.
- It's good for you.

446
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,230
Can you give my niece
your autograph?

447
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:57,690
My autograph?

448
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:00,130
Your name?

449
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:04,120
- It's JUNG Se-eun.
- He's not in a good mood.

450
00:59:10,230 --> 00:59:11,630
Thanks.

451
00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:14,420
BONG?

452
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:18,450
Do you drink?

453
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:21,750
Why don't we go out tonight?

454
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:24,430
Your birthday was
the day before, right?

455
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:29,690
I got this but never had
a chance to give you. Here.

456
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:33,150
You shouldn't have...

457
00:59:35,890 --> 00:59:37,590
It's a scarf.

458
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:39,760
Let me put it on you.

459
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:43,320
A mirror!

460
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:02,790
What do you think?

461
01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:06,290
I like the color
and design.

462
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:10,620
Kuty 33 is a popular brand?

463
01:00:10,930 --> 01:00:14,420
It's top of the line.

464
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:18,950
Wear it until we crank up.

465
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:23,650
- AD?
- Yes?

466
01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:26,160
Let's call it a day.
Wrap it up.

467
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:29,990
We're done for the night!

468
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:46,720
Being polite won't
get you anywhere.

469
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:49,450
It's okay. Sit down.

470
01:00:49,690 --> 01:00:51,960
How long have you
been acting?

471
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:56,460
About 5 years since college.

472
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,480
I've seen so many girls
come and go.

473
01:01:02,690 --> 01:01:06,090
They had nothing
but looks.

474
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,520
What?

475
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:11,560
They were after glamour...

476
01:01:11,690 --> 01:01:14,590
...but didn't want any pain
that came with it..

477
01:01:15,230 --> 01:01:17,830
Mi-jin has looks
and a good body.

478
01:01:17,830 --> 01:01:20,120
You liked her
when we cast her.

479
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:22,660
You should know better.

480
01:01:22,790 --> 01:01:25,030
Looks don't do tricks
in this business.

481
01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:28,090
Teach her.
Give her your energy.

482
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:30,260
We'd appreciate it.

483
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:34,890
I'll do anything.
I can't quit now.

484
01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:36,450
Please!

485
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,290
Thank you.

486
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:41,890
God...
What are you thankful for?

487
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:43,590
I didn't say yes.

488
01:01:43,730 --> 01:01:47,250
Hwa-ran,
Please, teach her.

489
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:50,090
Please, teach me.

490
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:56,520
Okay, fine.
Step 1.

491
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:07,320
Feel for yourself
how attractive you are.

492
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:13,930
Be confident that
you're sexy and charming.

493
01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:19,120
Rid yourself
of a loser attitude.

494
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:22,820
The past is gone.
What counts is today.

495
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:26,890
You're gonna turn
into a sexy icon.

496
01:02:27,830 --> 01:02:29,450
Let your hair loose.

497
01:02:29,590 --> 01:02:31,860
Be revealing enough.

498
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:36,290
It will spark men's
secret desire.

499
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:39,920
Eye contact matters
the most.

500
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:43,820
Look your prey
straight in the eyes.

501
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:48,720
Now you're reborn.

502
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:59,850
Cast a killing glance.

503
01:03:00,530 --> 01:03:02,960
No, make it sexier.

504
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:06,220
Be confident.

505
01:03:07,690 --> 01:03:08,660
That's it.

506
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,290
Cheers.

507
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,750
Let me make...

508
01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:16,550
Bottom's up.

509
01:03:25,030 --> 01:03:26,690
Mi-jin?

510
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:30,190
I thought you'd be
bored with me.

511
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:32,990
Mi-jin, sit beside him.

512
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:39,920
Come on, let's drink.
Bottom's up!

513
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:51,320
I know you had a long day.

514
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:53,430
- No.
- Oh,

515
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:56,950
I forgot I had a meeting.

516
01:03:57,130 --> 01:04:01,190
You can sing and talk.
Have some fun.

517
01:04:01,330 --> 01:04:04,120
Don't mind the bill.
It's on me.

518
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:48,590
Mi-jin?

519
01:04:48,830 --> 01:04:52,230
Yes?
What do you want?

520
01:04:52,500 --> 01:05:00,560
We did that take 33 times
because of your cry.

521
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:04,320
Try it for me.

522
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:13,720
I guess we'll be shooting
all day tomorrow.

523
01:05:20,030 --> 01:05:22,430
Give it some emotion
this time.

524
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:30,260
It's not about screaming.

525
01:05:33,830 --> 01:05:35,890
No, make it sadder.

526
01:05:37,890 --> 01:05:39,920
Think of yourself
as an alien.

527
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:54,760
He's obsessed with
a ghost cry.

528
01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:59,730
After 30 shots,
that's all they did.

529
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:09,450
He must be either gay
or impotent.

530
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:52,630
Give me your energy.
Please...

531
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:48,220
I killed them both
and became human.

532
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:54,760
Cut!

533
01:07:54,930 --> 01:07:56,220
Okay!

534
01:08:01,830 --> 01:08:04,130
Mi-jin, that was good.

535
01:08:04,130 --> 01:08:07,620
Let's do another take.
I can do better.

536
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:13,890
I'm sorry
we're cranking up today.

537
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:17,620
Let's do it again.

538
01:08:17,730 --> 01:08:19,130
Let's do it again.

539
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:25,520
I killed them both
and became human.

540
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:29,890
Cut! Okay.

541
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,650
We're done.

542
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:57,920
Dinner is at 6.
Good job, guys!

543
01:09:07,830 --> 01:09:09,230
BONG?

544
01:09:09,230 --> 01:09:10,660
Mi-jin.

545
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:14,090
I got little something
for you.

546
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:15,490
You shouldn't have...

547
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:19,030
You've come a long way.

548
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:25,260
I guess our practice
at Karaoke paid off.

549
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:28,420
I was so embarrassed then.

550
01:09:28,690 --> 01:09:30,590
Quite an experience
for me though.

551
01:09:32,530 --> 01:09:33,890
BONG...

552
01:09:33,890 --> 01:09:35,290
Please.

553
01:09:42,230 --> 01:09:44,220
You're warm.

554
01:09:48,730 --> 01:09:52,630
Mi-jin, I love you.

555
01:09:55,330 --> 01:09:56,450
BONG...

556
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:02,320
The movie isn't done yet.

557
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,520
It needs editing.

558
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:23,880
Mi-jin...

559
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:42,660
How do you feel about
your new life?

560
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,460
It's so refreshing.

561
01:11:45,690 --> 01:11:49,020
Let's have a party
of our own.

562
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:51,820
Sure. Why not?

563
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:59,520
Why'd you choose me?

564
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:05,260
You were so helpless
like myself long ago.

565
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:09,920
When were you chosen?

566
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:12,230
100 years ago.

567
01:12:18,430 --> 01:12:20,550
I couldn't be more
confident now.

568
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:23,850
Who will do the editing?

569
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:29,590
An assistant director.
He's good.

570
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:31,750
Here, cheers.

571
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,390
Cheers.

572
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:45,090
Didn't it hurt?
I was in so much pain the first time.

573
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:48,920
Not really.
I was drunk.

574
01:12:51,030 --> 01:12:53,430
Your blood was so fresh.

575
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,950
BONG'S blood was
a bit salty.

576
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:04,360
You'll get used to it.

577
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:10,160
How old are you?

578
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:16,220
120. Age is just a number.

579
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:21,390
It's delicious.

580
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:25,130
That part is good
for your skin.

581
01:13:25,730 --> 01:13:29,390
What if I get hooked
and crave it?

582
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:34,480
Control yourself. But you must
eat it once every 2 years.

583
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:38,690
Cause there are many men
who need to go.

584
01:14:53,860 --> 01:14:55,950
Jane... Jane...

585
01:14:57,930 --> 01:14:59,360
Don't talk.

586
01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:09,850
In the End is My Beginning

587
01:15:40,230 --> 01:15:41,350
Remember me?

588
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:44,620
My daughter tutored you
in high school.

589
01:15:44,930 --> 01:15:47,660
I even cooked for you.

590
01:15:47,790 --> 01:15:50,090
How dare you show up here!

591
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:51,390
Stop it.

592
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:54,030
You're nothing but a whore.

593
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:56,250
Get out of here!

594
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:38,320
Honey?

595
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:42,960
Get up.
Breakfast is ready.

596
01:16:44,230 --> 01:16:47,090
Let me sleep some more.

597
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:49,430
Come on.
Let's eat together.

598
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:51,860
You know we can't.

599
01:16:51,860 --> 01:16:53,450
Why not?

600
01:16:56,030 --> 01:16:57,890
I'm dead. Remember?

601
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:47,220
It's a plant.

602
01:18:48,530 --> 01:18:50,990
"Water it and
what you need will grow."

603
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:07,580
What are you doing here?

604
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:10,050
How'd you get in?

605
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:12,560
I've been here for a while.

606
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:17,190
Get out of here.
Now!

607
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:21,860
No point kicking me out.
Cause I'll be back.

608
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:26,850
What's going on here?

609
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:30,390
Did you call her?

610
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:35,860
Get out.

611
01:20:35,860 --> 01:20:37,560
- No.
- Now.

612
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:38,330
Please.
Get out.

613
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:42,330
Let me stay here.
I'll do anything.

614
01:20:42,330 --> 01:20:43,590
Shut up and leave.

615
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:45,090
I'm begging you.
Let me stay.

616
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:46,100
- Please...
- Get out!

617
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:47,620
Let me stay.

618
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:06,330
Let me stay...

619
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:07,890
Please.

620
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:10,320
Why don't you?

621
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,660
No way.

622
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:13,300
Give her a break.

623
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:14,230
I said no!

624
01:21:14,230 --> 01:21:16,350
Let me stay.

625
01:21:17,930 --> 01:21:19,420
Please.

626
01:21:19,730 --> 01:21:21,160
Let her or I'll leave.

627
01:21:59,730 --> 01:22:00,990
Hi.

628
01:23:21,690 --> 01:23:23,790
You can't get over him?

629
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,430
Searching for his memories...

630
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:31,030
It's not that.

631
01:23:31,030 --> 01:23:32,550
Save it.

632
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:36,420
That's what you're here for,
isn't it?

633
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:39,390
I won't touch his things
if it bothers you.

634
01:23:39,690 --> 01:23:41,250
You sure?

635
01:23:45,530 --> 01:23:47,960
Change into that.

636
01:23:49,830 --> 01:23:53,060
It'll bring back
vivid memories of him.

637
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:12,850
You're killing me.

638
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:16,990
Make it tighter.

639
01:24:20,030 --> 01:24:21,260
Am I pretty?

640
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:38,690
You're still so pretty.

641
01:24:42,330 --> 01:24:43,830
What'd you do
after high school?

642
01:24:43,830 --> 01:24:46,590
A lot of things.

643
01:24:47,660 --> 01:24:51,530
I delivered. I cleaned.

644
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:53,820
I gave manicures.

645
01:24:54,530 --> 01:24:59,430
Then I acted in a few plays.

646
01:25:04,530 --> 01:25:06,290
I did magic, too.

647
01:25:08,690 --> 01:25:11,820
You know what you're best at.

648
01:25:12,730 --> 01:25:14,320
Like what?

649
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:17,620
Recognize this?

650
01:25:18,330 --> 01:25:20,890
You could've been a porn star.

651
01:25:21,630 --> 01:25:23,530
You were a slut
back in school days.

652
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:26,460
I wasn't.
You know that.

653
01:25:26,660 --> 01:25:28,590
I thought I did.

654
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:43,950
Eat it.

655
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:51,630
Eat it all.

656
01:25:52,030 --> 01:25:56,360
So you can cherish
such a precious memory.

657
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:26,560
It's some sight to see.

658
01:27:24,690 --> 01:27:25,630
Are you OK?

659
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:27,560
I'm fine.

660
01:27:28,830 --> 01:27:29,890
Come in.

661
01:27:31,130 --> 01:27:32,360
Hi.

662
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:37,230
She's just a maid.
Don't mind her.

663
01:27:37,230 --> 01:27:38,520
Draw the tub for us.

664
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:39,860
Let's go.

665
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:41,420
Let's go!

666
01:27:51,630 --> 01:27:52,890
Stop it.

667
01:27:54,630 --> 01:27:59,250
Hey! Come up here.

668
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:01,690
What this is for?

669
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:03,150
You... favor?

670
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:11,490
Tie me.

671
01:28:12,860 --> 01:28:14,160
You are for real?

672
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:16,260
Tie me up.

673
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:27,820
What are you doing?

674
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:30,330
Tie me like he tied you.

675
01:28:33,030 --> 01:28:34,430
Tighter.

676
01:28:35,630 --> 01:28:39,390
Come on. Tighter.

677
01:28:39,690 --> 01:28:41,190
Oh, come on.
Are you sure you want...

678
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:43,860
Tighter! Tighter!
Come on!

679
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:46,230
You can do better!

680
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:50,950
Tie me tighter.

681
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:53,030
Make it tighter.

682
01:28:53,030 --> 01:28:53,930
Tighter.

683
01:28:54,060 --> 01:28:56,090
- I'm get going...
- Where are you going?

684
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:59,220
Get back here!

685
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:31,130
It's no fun.

686
01:29:32,730 --> 01:29:35,520
Oh God...

687
01:29:35,660 --> 01:29:38,150
What's wrong with me?

688
01:31:17,230 --> 01:31:18,630
What's that?

689
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:30,990
In case I couldn't stand
this punishment.

690
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:48,390
Jung-ha...

691
01:32:25,590 --> 01:32:27,320
It feels weird.

692
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:29,760
What?

693
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:36,190
A wife and a lover celebrating
his birthday together.

694
01:32:37,860 --> 01:32:40,490
What a lucky bastard.

695
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,460
Leave now.

696
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,060
What?

697
01:32:48,060 --> 01:32:49,460
Leave.

698
01:32:50,030 --> 01:32:52,460
Stop saying that.

699
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:57,020
I'd rather kill myself.

700
01:33:00,030 --> 01:33:01,960
I mean it.

701
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:10,690
It started raining that day
unexpectedly.

702
01:33:12,890 --> 01:33:15,190
All my dad did was magic.

703
01:33:16,660 --> 01:33:19,860
So I didn't expect him
to pick me up.

704
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:24,720
You stole me an umbrella
from a store.

705
01:33:25,830 --> 01:33:28,020
Right then, a raindrop...

706
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:33,430
It fell on your forehead
like a God's voice.

707
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:38,050
And it exploded
over your eyebrows.

708
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:41,080
So did my heart.

709
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:44,290
If I could get near you...

710
01:33:44,790 --> 01:33:47,460
...I would've done worse

711
01:33:47,460 --> 01:33:49,760
-than seducing him.
- That's enough.

712
01:33:51,730 --> 01:33:53,790
He might hear you.

713
01:33:54,660 --> 01:33:56,590
Don't make him upset
on his birthday.

714
01:33:56,690 --> 01:33:58,890
When we first kissed...

715
01:34:00,660 --> 01:34:03,130
Stop it.
I don't remember.

716
01:34:04,030 --> 01:34:05,720
My tongue...

717
01:34:08,230 --> 01:34:11,090
When it got into your mouth...

718
01:34:15,030 --> 01:34:17,890
You told me
you heard a bell ringing.

719
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:23,960
Was it the same
when you kissed Jane?

720
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,480
Yes.

721
01:34:32,790 --> 01:34:35,490
You truly loved him.

722
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:21,350
Tie me up.

723
01:38:20,230 --> 01:38:21,920
Stop.

724
01:38:28,460 --> 01:38:30,620
I said stop.

725
01:38:35,030 --> 01:38:36,930
Am I not better than him?

726
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:43,160
You don't arouse me.

727
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:38,550
Stop it, will you?

728
01:39:39,230 --> 01:39:41,160
Can't you see?

729
01:39:42,690 --> 01:39:46,250
I'm you, Jung-ha.

730
01:40:44,890 --> 01:40:46,190
Awake?

731
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:49,650
You can leave now.

732
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:52,660
Thanks.

733
01:40:54,260 --> 01:40:56,120
I have to ask you.

734
01:40:56,760 --> 01:40:57,890
Yes?

735
01:40:59,530 --> 01:41:01,190
Did you know?

736
01:41:03,330 --> 01:41:05,450
Naru didn't...

737
01:41:05,590 --> 01:41:06,920
I know.

738
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:49,660
Be good.

739
01:44:50,060 --> 01:44:51,360
Hi.

740
01:45:07,260 --> 01:45:11,460
Hey!
You're 30 minutes late.

741
01:45:11,590 --> 01:45:14,750
Why the hell are you late?

742
01:45:20,100 --> 01:45:20,960
God...

743
01:45:23,330 --> 01:45:24,420
Did it hurt?

744
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:25,980
You're buying.

745
01:45:30,130 --> 01:45:31,390
Excuse me?

746
01:45:46,230 --> 01:45:47,590
You haven't changed.

747
01:45:50,760 --> 01:45:51,950
You either.

748
01:45:55,630 --> 01:45:58,890
We'll have fun today.

749
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:02,720
Just like we did.

750
01:46:04,030 --> 01:46:05,430
Just today?

751
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:33,660
Can't a girl eat?

752
01:46:34,100 --> 01:46:39,220
I've never seen a girl
eating like a pig.

753
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:49,090
The beautiful eat a lot.

754
01:46:50,790 --> 01:46:52,890
Here, eat some.

755
01:47:03,530 --> 01:47:04,930
You won't get it?

756
01:47:10,030 --> 01:47:14,430
Wanna see something funny?

757
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:27,890
What about Su-jung?

758
01:47:29,160 --> 01:47:30,920
Going together?

759
01:47:31,330 --> 01:47:35,280
We will.
If she decides to.

760
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:40,860
Is that why
we're doing this?

761
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:49,360
I just wanted to know
how she feels about me.

762
01:47:51,460 --> 01:47:52,930
What about you?

763
01:47:54,200 --> 01:47:57,090
I wanted to make sure, too.

764
01:47:58,790 --> 01:48:00,450
Make sure what?

765
01:48:01,730 --> 01:48:08,090
What Ji-woon means to me.

766
01:48:10,690 --> 01:48:12,290
I know you like him.

767
01:48:12,300 --> 01:48:14,850
What about him?

768
01:48:15,430 --> 01:48:20,520
He will find out today.

769
01:48:23,590 --> 01:48:26,750
I wonder how it will end.

770
01:48:43,630 --> 01:48:45,920
You've done that before.

771
01:48:46,060 --> 01:48:48,990
I know.
I'll do more today.

772
01:48:49,160 --> 01:48:51,290
What else are you gonna
show me?

773
01:48:51,630 --> 01:48:54,090
Show you?
I don't think so.

774
01:48:58,930 --> 01:49:00,760
I'm sleeping with him today.

775
01:49:04,630 --> 01:49:07,530
You suck in bed.

776
01:49:09,060 --> 01:49:10,050
He's way better.

777
01:51:04,830 --> 01:51:06,660
You're crazy.

778
01:51:09,930 --> 01:51:12,450
You think so?

779
01:51:14,230 --> 01:51:19,680
You don't think you are?

780
01:51:20,030 --> 01:51:27,830
How long have you been
with an art teacher?

781
01:51:28,130 --> 01:51:30,820
Beats me.
I can't remember.

782
01:51:33,960 --> 01:51:36,330
I just can't understand you.

783
01:51:45,200 --> 01:51:46,130
What?

784
01:51:46,260 --> 01:51:48,590
Can you understand
what we're doing then?

785
01:51:56,930 --> 01:51:58,420
Who is it?

786
01:51:59,830 --> 01:52:01,520
It's Yoon-jung.

787
01:52:10,660 --> 01:52:12,820
She's sounding you out.

788
01:52:13,960 --> 01:52:16,860
I don't know.
I don't know.

789
01:52:17,530 --> 01:52:21,120
This is pathetic.
Why'd you suggest this?

790
01:52:26,230 --> 01:52:29,630
You're a fool.
If this will break you up,

791
01:52:29,630 --> 01:52:32,190
you're not meant to be together.

792
01:52:33,130 --> 01:52:34,790
So naive.

793
01:52:56,500 --> 01:52:57,620
What'd he say?

794
01:53:02,430 --> 01:53:04,260
"Do as you please."

795
01:53:08,460 --> 01:53:10,830
He doesn't mean it.

796
01:53:11,160 --> 01:53:16,180
He's just pretending to be cool.

797
01:53:17,030 --> 01:53:18,460
Like you?

798
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:24,750
I know how I feel
about Su-jung.

799
01:53:26,460 --> 01:53:28,520
What about her?

800
01:53:46,060 --> 01:53:51,150
Tell me.
ls Se-eun ok with this?

801
01:53:58,760 --> 01:54:02,090
How'd you guys HOOK UP?

802
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:26,390
Sang-min.

803
01:54:27,100 --> 01:54:28,720
Do you wanna...

804
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:36,920
...kiss me?

805
01:54:42,300 --> 01:54:45,850
What are you trying to pull?

806
01:54:57,630 --> 01:55:00,190
See you tomorrow at school.

807
01:55:17,960 --> 01:55:19,820
I can't believe he did that.

808
01:55:22,630 --> 01:55:25,390
He hasn't called you?

809
01:55:47,960 --> 01:55:50,930
By the way,
where are we going?

810
01:55:51,730 --> 01:55:53,850
We have a thing to do.

811
01:55:55,430 --> 01:55:56,830
We do?

812
01:55:58,360 --> 01:55:59,660
What?

813
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:41,190
You Okay?

814
01:56:41,330 --> 01:56:43,730
Huh? Yes.

815
01:56:48,860 --> 01:56:52,160
I like it better with Ji-woon.

816
01:56:52,430 --> 01:56:55,220
Of course.
He's your boyfriend.

817
01:56:57,360 --> 01:56:58,420
I'm leaving.

818
01:56:58,660 --> 01:57:00,390
Okay.
Should I walk you?

819
01:57:00,530 --> 01:57:02,020
No, it's okay.

820
01:57:02,460 --> 01:57:06,260
Yoon-jung,
we should take a picture.

821
01:57:06,260 --> 01:57:08,390
Oh, right.

822
01:57:18,060 --> 01:57:20,120
Wait, wait.

823
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:23,460
What?

824
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:27,650
Tell me honestly.

825
01:57:27,890 --> 01:57:29,020
What?

826
01:57:32,060 --> 01:57:34,960
Is this your revenge
against Sang-min?

827
01:57:35,500 --> 01:57:36,980
You don't wanna do it?

828
01:57:38,200 --> 01:57:42,920
No, I wanna do it.

829
01:58:23,590 --> 01:58:25,920
You like being with me?

830
01:58:34,590 --> 01:58:36,190
You're no different.

831
01:58:50,830 --> 01:58:52,420
"Do as you please"?

832
01:59:17,300 --> 01:59:18,560
That's me?

833
01:59:18,930 --> 01:59:19,990
Let me see.

834
01:59:22,690 --> 01:59:23,630
It's you.

835
01:59:23,630 --> 01:59:25,920
Let me draw you.
Don't look.

836
01:59:28,930 --> 01:59:31,290
- What is this?
- Wait.

837
01:59:34,690 --> 01:59:36,390
You're making it worse.

838
01:59:36,500 --> 01:59:38,320
Fix mine then.

839
01:59:38,730 --> 01:59:41,020
- Long legs...
- Make them longer.

840
01:59:41,130 --> 01:59:42,650
Like this...

841
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,430
- Why?
- Draw it again.

842
01:59:45,430 --> 01:59:46,220
Stop it.

843
02:00:02,330 --> 02:00:03,820
You're so good.

844
02:00:06,060 --> 02:00:08,320
Don't let it go to your head.

845
02:00:08,460 --> 02:00:10,720
I won't let you win
this time.

846
02:00:11,360 --> 02:00:14,020
Wait.
Let me gather my Ki.

847
02:00:16,630 --> 02:00:17,650
Let's go.

848
02:00:20,830 --> 02:00:22,120
Thanks.

849
02:00:22,360 --> 02:00:24,190
No way.
You're going down.

850
02:00:52,760 --> 02:00:55,250
I wish I could be cool
about this.

851
02:01:23,160 --> 02:01:27,150
I don't think
I can see you again.

852
02:04:44,660 --> 02:04:46,090
Ji-woon.

853
02:04:46,760 --> 02:04:49,160
Let's not do it again.

854
02:04:55,360 --> 02:04:59,500
Yesterday, I couldn't...

855
02:04:59,500 --> 02:05:03,650
You're not supposed
to tell me.

856
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:06,390
Right.

857
02:05:12,630 --> 02:05:13,680
I love you.

858
02:05:16,030 --> 02:05:17,520
Ditto.

859
02:05:21,160 --> 02:05:24,180
You! "Do as you please"?
What was that?

860
02:05:25,260 --> 02:05:28,490
Get back here!
Ji-woon!

861
02:05:28,830 --> 02:05:31,850
I love you, Yoon-jung!
