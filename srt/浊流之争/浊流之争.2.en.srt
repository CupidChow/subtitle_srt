1
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:46,124
The Murky Stream

2
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:50,796
TWO. THE WIND THAT STIRS IN MAPO

3
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,730
Choi Jeongyeop.

4
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,357
He is not suitable.

5
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,109
What are you going to do now?

6
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,610
I need to find someone greedier

7
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,946
and more powerful.

8
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:18,243
Do you truly mean to build
a new foundation on this land?

9
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,286
Now is the time.

10
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:24,457
I cannot let my brothers and my children
live as subjects of Mongol.

11
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,709
I would rather die than see that happen.

12
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,171
Will I be able to live

13
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,840
with my child and my wife?

14
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,679
Of course.

15
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:42,767
For their sake,
we must take over the Gyeonggang River.

16
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,607
GYEONGWON
JUNG CHUN

17
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,288
JUNG CHUN

18
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:58,125
JUNG CHUN
