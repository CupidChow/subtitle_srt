1
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:49,443
The Murky Stream

2
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:54,114
EIGHT. TO LIVE OR TO DIE

3
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,412
Open it.

4
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:08,754
You bastard.

5
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,548
You attack in plain sight?

6
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:15,886
I only did it to grant the wish of a man
who was asking for death himself.

7
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:21,183
I would like you to tell me
why I'm still being kept here.

8
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:25,228
You're still holding your head up high
which tells me you don't understand.

9
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:28,023
This is much more serious
than you can imagine.

10
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,360
Have I not already explained?

11
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,904
He was the first to attack with his knife.

12
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:34,988
Not me.

13
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,205
So what?

14
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,666
You have my life to use at your disposal.

15
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,877
Keep me alive if you want to.

16
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,463
If I'm not useful, get rid of me.

17
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:54,675
You know that I am here
to follow your orders, My Lord.

18
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,802
How nice.

19
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,138
You are a very well-mannered person.

20
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,183
Then swear to me.

21
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:07,604
Will you turn into the beast I wield
without restraint?

22
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,981
Bark if I tell you to bark?

23
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:12,317
Bite when I command you to kill?

24
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,946
I'm willing to do whatever you ask of me.

25
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:24,246
Are you now?

26
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,373
Yes, I am.

27
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:32,087
I'm willing to throw myself in a fire
if that's what you require of me.

28
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,637
Wang Hae was set free.
Who ordered his release?

29
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:24,931
Is there a reason for your concern?

30
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:26,933
That criminal wasn't even questioned yet.

31
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,227
So why was he released?

32
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,564
I made my decision
after reviewing the case thoroughly.

33
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:33,857
And that is that.

34
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,027
Malbok was the one who started the fight
from what I've heard.

35
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,239
Wang Hae was defending himself
against the man who tried to kill him.

36
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:43,283
How can we charge him for doing that?

37
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:46,870
If anyone is guilty,
it should be the boy who started it.

38
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,664
They say he went out of his way
to find and kill that boy.

39
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,541
Is that not so?

40
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,418
Those are the words of mere bandits.

41
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,463
How could you believe
everything they say, huh?

42
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,756
We don't know.

43
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,300
That is why we must conduct
an investigation.

44
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,517
You know what I think?

45
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:13,480
-I think you're suspicious.
-What's that supposed to mean?

46
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,106
Why are you making such a fuss?

47
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,818
This case is clearly important to you.

48
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:22,322
Look here, Officer Jung.

49
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,407
I heard an interesting rumor.

50
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:30,247
On your first day, you had a meeting
with a scum of a man they call Jang,

51
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,499
by your choosing.

52
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,295
How can we guarantee a fair investigation,

53
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:41,591
when we have a dishonest officer like you
in charge, right?

54
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:45,512
Absolute nonsense. Hilarious!

55
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,515
Don't you agree, Captain Park?

56
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,393
Yes.

57
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,939
Keep laughing.

58
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,775
Laugh all you want.

59
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:13,832
Jungbok.

60
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:16,710
Jungbok.

61
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,715
You really must eat something now.

62
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:27,971
All right.

63
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,439
Is Jungbok okay?

64
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,025
He doesn't feel like eating.

65
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,908
Hey, Boss. Did you hear what happened?

66
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,869
The Police Bureau decided to release
that Wang Hae bastard.

67
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:54,372
Poor Malbok.
We need to take revenge for him.

68
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:57,751
You idiots still haven't learned
your damn lesson.

69
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:03,298
Tell me. How many thumbs or forefingers
came to Malbok's funeral?

70
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:05,592
Not a single one!

71
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,843
Why?

72
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:11,848
In times of misfortune,
all bandits just walk away.

73
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,517
Why do you think
everyone's tiptoeing around

74
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,519
as if they're scared to make noise?

75
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:20,148
Getting on Wang Hae's bad side
means they'll disappear without a trace.

76
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,025
And you want to take revenge?

77
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,612
Just look at the state of the world
that we live in.

78
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,491
Boss, no.

79
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,868
That man murdered our brother...

80
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,746
and you want us to bow to him? Really?

81
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,041
What the hell do you take me for, bastard?

82
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,838
Where did Siyul go?

83
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,757
He was over at the dock.

84
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,134
He's sitting at the riverbank now.

85
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:51,388
All day long,
he's been staring out at the water.

86
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,350
He won't answer anyone who calls.

87
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,149
Our little Malbok was so kind.

88
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:07,320
I hope he went to a good place
even though he was a bandit.

89
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,448
Don't be so stupid!

90
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:14,411
Why would you even say some...
something like that?

91
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,373
It's not like
he has any other place to go.

92
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,961
Be quiet and eat your damn meal!

93
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,423
It's bad luck to talk about the dead
when you're eating.

94
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,927
Why do you raise your voice
while we're eating dinner?

95
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,095
I'm trying to eat.

96
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,392
Keep eating.

97
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,271
Eat. You too, Gaechun.

98
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,153
Eat up.

99
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,203
You seem familiar.

100
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,331
I think it's the look in your eyes.

101
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:07,130
<i>I swear... I will kill you.</i>

102
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,448
Hello, My Lord.

103
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:40,830
You may enter.

104
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,341
Don't worry. I assure you
you can trust this man.

105
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:52,926
Introduce yourself.

106
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:55,637
I am Choi Jeongyeop.

107
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,723
Assistant Officer Jung Chun
of the Police Bureau.

108
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,562
So all of these pieces here,

109
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,981
this is the map?

110
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:11,611
The map will be completed soon,
and we will finally see the full picture.

111
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,864
This is truly amazing.

112
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:20,161
Major and minor roads crossing each other.

113
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,998
It shows the locations of provinces,
townships,

114
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,918
beacons, and even all the fortresses.

115
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,881
I've never seen a map
so detailed and elaborate.

116
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:35,385
It's unbelievable.

117
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:41,641
And really, I owe it all to this man here.

118
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,437
My Lord.

119
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,607
I had told my daughter,

120
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:53,486
that it could be a while
before our nation stands upright again.

121
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,865
Is that still what you think?

122
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:58,575
I'm no longer certain.

123
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,452
Now I am placing my hope in you.

124
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,330
Hope, you say?

125
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:10,003
My only wish... is that you and I
can use this map for a good cause.

126
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:14,841
If that is your wish, I'm glad to hear it.

127
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,179
We share the same ideas.

128
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:32,734
A map?

129
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:36,779
I saw a few painters working on it.
I'm sure that's what it was.

130
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,656
I saw it with my very own eyes.

131
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,754
This map showed all eight provinces
of Joseon?

132
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,256
You swear it?

133
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,550
I would never dare to lie to you.

134
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:01,596
I know that is what I saw.
I swear on my life.

135
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,231
You must do... exactly as I tell you to.

136
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:12,815
Yes.

137
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:22,200
Oh... It was a map?
Are you sure about that?

138
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,285
Multiple painters are staying there.

139
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:28,873
Everyone else is locked out.
No one can even approach the building.

140
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:33,628
I see! I had expected him to do this
for a while now.

141
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:38,383
It's been said that he who owns the roads
can also command the country.

142
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,845
And now maps are seen
as treasonous and forbidden.

143
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,974
This is an act of rebellion as I see it.

144
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,058
What could it be...

145
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,811
if not for treason?

146
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,898
My! It is!

147
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:56,109
However, My Lord,

148
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,362
it's only a suspicion.

149
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,572
But it's true that a lot of people

150
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:05,410
still trust and follow
the Senior Guardian General.

151
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,954
Don't you think
that's actually better for us?

152
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,792
The commoners trust and follow him
as if he were king.

153
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,253
If that's not a traitor, then what is?

154
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:19,674
The Senior Guardian General
was an outstanding government official

155
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:20,967
and officer,

156
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,971
yet I never respected the General
at any point along his career.

157
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:28,850
Ultimately, human nature
is like a starving demon.

158
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:33,229
It's all disgusting and rotten.
It's total hypocrisy.

159
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,315
And do not forget.

160
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:39,861
His death is the only way
for you to survive.

161
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:46,034
By working tirelessly,
I'll bring to you evidence you require

162
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,910
to prove he's guilty of treason.

163
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,437
Officer.

164
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,901
Who's there?

165
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,830
It's late out. Why are you here?

166
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:35,666
I came all this way...

167
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:40,004
because I need to ask you
to do me a favor.

168
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,631
What kind of favor?

169
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,113
JUNG CHUN

170
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:06,239
What?

171
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,451
How did you get your hands on this?

172
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:14,122
Siyul was never able to leave Mapo,
you see...

173
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,667
all because of that letter.

174
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,461
Just tell me what's happening.

175
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:25,591
I am worried that right now,

176
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:28,469
Siyul is heading
straight into the belly of the beast.

177
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:34,142
Only you can put a stop to him, My Lord.

178
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,521
Siyul needs to leave Mapo
for his own good.

179
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,358
So convince him to go.

180
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,748
You have my condolences.

181
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,335
I heard you cherished the boy
like he was a brother.

182
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,420
Are you going to be okay?

183
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,346
You seem determined not to say anything.

184
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,896
A man named Mudeok, he gave this to me.

185
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,780
Siyul, why didn't you tell me?

186
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:15,284
I had never expected that
my letter would put you in this situation.

187
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,913
Are you really planning on
going through with this?

188
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:23,876
Chun.

189
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:33,928
I think you'd better go.

190
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:37,348
I don't wish to talk to anyone right now.

191
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,851
You can hold it against me if you want.

192
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:43,938
But I don't want you to get hurt.

193
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:47,692
Truly.

194
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,236
You needn't worry.

195
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,697
How could I fault you for that?

196
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,494
You do what you have to do.

197
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,249
And I'll do what I have to.

198
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,960
That's all there is.

199
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,305
Please be careful.

200
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,799
Where the hell have you been?

201
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,525
How are you?

202
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,110
You okay?

203
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:25,665
This letter...

204
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,125
Thank you.

205
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,878
You can bring it with you...

206
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,550
Go wherever you want.

207
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,887
You treat bandits as if we're snakes.

208
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:44,392
These days, I've been getting
really sick of seeing you.

209
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,186
If you want me to leave, I will.

210
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:49,397
But first...

211
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,943
I will give back
what I owe you before I do.

212
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:57,655
How thick in the head
could you possibly be, kid?

213
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,825
Pursuing revenge is a bad idea.

214
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,411
Wang Hae's not someone
you should mess with.

215
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:07,164
Whatever you say,
it won't make a difference to me.

216
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,460
I swear...

217
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,340
I will make him pay no matter what.

218
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,093
And then what?

219
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,804
Have you considered
the consequences at all?

220
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,849
After you cause a scene
and leave us all here?

221
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,976
Do you think we can survive on our own?

222
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,646
I'm beggin' you not to do anything
for our sakes and just go!

223
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:32,523
Sorry, but I can't.

224
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,775
You idiot!

225
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,861
So we'll be stuck
eating filthy rice again,

226
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,404
and it'll all be thanks to you?

227
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,489
Do you think I can't just kill you myself?

228
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,285
If I take this letter over
to the Police Bureau,

229
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:47,455
they wouldn't hesitate
to slice your tongue off with an axe!

230
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:49,415
I know.

231
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:52,710
Take my letter...

232
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,006
and do whatever you want with it.

233
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,176
And I will do what I have to do.

234
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,559
You fucking bastard.

235
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,937
I don't even need this, asshole!

236
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:17,485
What's wrong with kids these days?

237
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:20,738
Whatever.

238
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,024
Yes.

239
00:21:58,943 --> 00:21:59,944
You did it.

240
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,198
You did it.

241
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,538
This is...

242
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,582
Extraordinary.

243
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,921
You've taught me to be patient.

244
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:20,506
To wait...

245
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:24,009
Until I know that
the fruit has been ripened.

246
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:25,594
Absolutely.

247
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:30,850
If you pick the fruit when it's not ripe,
you cannot enjoy the sweet flavor.

248
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:32,810
The time is upon us.

249
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:36,981
I think the fruit... is sweetest now.

250
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:40,067
Then the map is what you need to acquire.

251
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:44,530
If you have to cut his throat for it,
I don't care in the least.

252
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,242
No, that is exactly how it must be done.

253
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:52,246
Once you find where he's hiding,
I want you to tear him apart limb by limb

254
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:55,207
until nothing at all is left.

255
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,292
Do you understand?

256
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,002
Of course, My Lord.

257
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:03,173
Now, you are the Police Bureau's General.

258
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,060
Officer Lee.

259
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,645
Bring them in.

260
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,319
It begins tonight.

261
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:26,989
Is that fear I sense?

262
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,199
No, sir.

263
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:31,952
I will follow your commands.

264
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:27,549
What is the matter?

265
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:56,036
We may be in danger.

266
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,955
- What?
- This is my fault.

267
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:01,083
I should have seen this coming
and prepared us for it.

268
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,795
I was overjoyed by the map's completion,
and I let my guard down.

269
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:08,507
My Lord, please go now
while you're still able.

270
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,097
Secure the map quickly.

271
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:16,598
Now!

272
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:19,393
- Hurry!
- Yes!

273
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:00,976
Listen to me carefully.

274
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,311
Yes.

275
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,021
I'm entrusting the map to you.

276
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,231
What?

277
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:09,568
Can you deliver this to Lord Jo Yusu,
the Magistrate in Ganghwa?

278
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:11,987
My Lord!

279
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:14,615
I know you understand
how important this map is.

280
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:17,034
It could be the salvation of Joseon.

281
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:21,622
If it ends up in the hands
of the wrong people,

282
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,207
our whole nation could be at risk.

283
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,834
Joseon and its people
could face extinction.

284
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,380
The very future of Joseon...

285
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,426
rests with this map.

286
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:47,523
I will do my best.

287
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:51,068
I appreciate it.

288
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,708
I will try to buy you some time.

289
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,293
Use the door up there.

290
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:11,338
Wait.

291
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,094
I need you to swear.

292
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,474
You mustn't leave a single trace
of the map behind, or let anyone take it.

293
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,728
No matter who might try and do so.

294
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:29,106
I need you to swear.

295
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:33,819
I give you my word.

296
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:36,363
Now go, quickly.

297
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:47,791
Take these.

298
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:52,296
- Go, go, go!
- Stack them up, and block the entrance.

299
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:04,284
You dare to break in here?

300
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:05,869
Sheath your swords.

301
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,000
Nice to make your acquaintance.

302
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,044
I am Wang Hae.

303
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,796
I've been told a man from the north

304
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,965
has taken over the docks
and is sowing chaos.

305
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,385
That man has to be you.

306
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,637
I am honored that you would recognize me.

307
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:25,847
Tell me.

308
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:28,308
Where is it that
you've hidden the map, My Lord?

309
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,018
What?

310
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:32,479
Now depending on my decision,

311
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:36,024
there's a good chance that you won't
make it outta here in one piece.

312
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,193
You dare threaten me?

313
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,404
I suggest you leave while you can.

314
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:02,092
Where is the map?

315
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:04,970
Speak.

316
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:09,016
If you don't answer me,
you will die like all your other friends.

317
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:13,603
Don't kill me!

318
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,690
- It's the--
- Do not speak.

319
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:24,990
Your swordsmanship
lives up to your reputation.

320
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,034
You are welcome to try me.

321
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,163
Give him what he asks for.

322
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,079
What are you doing?

323
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:56,873
You can't even handle an old man?

324
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:41,603
We must not kill him.

325
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:45,523
Don't ruin the job
with your personal emotions.

326
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,345
How did it go?

327
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:18,014
I'll take care of it.
No need to worry anymore, sir.

328
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:19,599
General.

329
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:52,465
Well, is it here?

330
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:56,386
We searched thoroughly.

331
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,388
It's nowhere to be found.

332
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:12,569
My Lord.

333
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:14,696
They are barbarians.

334
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,489
As wild as animals.

335
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:18,366
I can't let this happen to you.

336
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,370
I don't want your life
to end up in these people's hands.

337
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,707
- So, where is the map hidden?
- My Lord.

338
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,544
He bit his tongue off
and is unable to speak.

339
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:35,967
Shit.

340
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,104
You are the most frustrating

341
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:50,398
and pitiful excuse for a man.

342
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:55,195
See you in the next life.

343
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,755
My last gift to you.

344
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,966
Don't resent me for what I've done.

345
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:19,219
My Lord.

346
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,763
Choi Jeongyeop is not here.

347
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,473
I don't see him anywhere.

348
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:27,477
I know who Choi Jeongyeop is.
Isn't he the owner of Choi's guild?

349
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,561
Yes.

350
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:31,981
I noticed him here earlier,
but he has disappeared.

351
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,401
I know this man.

352
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,404
And I can tell you exactly where he lives.

353
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:40,573
Go!

354
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:44,369
Without the map, all of you are dead too.

355
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,454
You must find it at all costs.

356
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:55,714
Father.

357
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:58,216
Stay quiet.

358
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,968
We must leave quickly now.

359
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,928
-What?
-Go to Daegwang Temple.

360
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,930
Remain there
with your brother for a while.

361
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,640
Monk Jingwan will help you.

362
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:07,016
It's the middle of the night.

363
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,768
There's no time to explain.

364
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:11,020
Where are the documents that I gave you?

365
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:14,107
They're in the flower-patterned closet.

366
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,567
Get them right now.

367
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:20,029
Wake up Seomseom and come to my quarters.

368
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:21,322
You must hurry.

369
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,981
Sir, what-- What is going on?

370
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,608
I need to get to Ganghwa Island.

371
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:58,610
You mean right now?

372
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,528
What's the fastest way to get there?

373
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:04,032
The fastest way there is by boat,
but it's too dark.

374
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:07,160
Finding someone to take you
at this hour will not be easy.

375
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:12,081
Father.

376
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:17,253
Here. These are
the farm deeds you requested.

377
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:18,588
Did you pack your things?

378
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:22,091
Yes. I packed only the essentials for now.

379
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:26,471
Head straight down to the dock.

380
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,056
The price doesn't matter.

381
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,391
Just find the fastest boat
and wait for me there.

382
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,353
Yes, leave it to me.

383
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,897
Be quick. There is no time to waste.

384
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:40,276
I'll head to the dock and wait for you.

385
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:42,737
Chief Kang.

386
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:25,154
You go on first and take this.

387
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:29,742
There are silver ingots
and a promissory note

388
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,786
for 2000 nyang issued by the guild.

389
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,831
They're as good as currency.
Use them when you need to.

390
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:37,166
What about you?

391
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,168
What is it that
you're going to do, Father?

392
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:42,130
Eun. You must be strong of heart
and mind from here on.

393
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:46,759
My Lord! My Lord!
I think some people jumped over the wall.

394
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:49,012
Who is it? What aren't you telling me?

395
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,806
-You have to go right now. Get up.
-What?

396
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,934
Just do what I tell you to do.
Every second matters.

397
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:10,158
I will meet you at Daegwang Temple soon.

398
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,452
Seomseom, take good care of Eun.

399
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,953
Yes, My Lord.

400
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:17,040
You need to leave now. We're out of time.

401
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:19,000
Please...

402
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:21,878
promise you'll be there.

403
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,671
I need you to go now.

404
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,313
You, go inside.

405
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,523
Scatter and find him.

406
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:52,760
The room is empty.

407
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:54,470
Search the house.

408
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:59,267
The candle is still burning.
He probably hasn't escaped yet.

409
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,770
Choi Jeongyeop. He must have the map.

410
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:26,419
<i>I know you understand</i>
<i>how important this map is.</i>

411
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,796
If it ends up in the hands
of the wrong people,

412
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,506
our whole nation could be at risk.

413
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,885
Joseon and its people
could face extinction.

414
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:38,973
The very future of Joseon
rests with this map.

415
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,086
Tell me where your father is.

416
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,758
<i>It's time for you to die.</i>

417
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,802
You'll meet your father in the next life.

418
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:30,900
Are you all right?

419
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,652
Assistant Officer.

420
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,363
Are you that eager
to meet a painful death?

421
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:39,075
Step aside, we can let you walk away.

422
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:40,243
Shut your mouth.

423
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:44,413
Let's find out
if you're more than just hollow threats.

424
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:49,335
Why is every Joseon person
so foolish?

425
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:52,004
Slay him.

426
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:01,764
Hurry and go.

427
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:04,892
If you get stuck,
look for the forefinger in Mapo.

428
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:06,185
He'll be able to help.

429
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:07,812
My lady.

430
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:10,273
- Catch that wench!
- Run!

431
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,599
Kill him first!

432
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:04,697
Make sure to watch carefully
when you get to the afterlife.

433
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,533
You'll see who ends up taking control...

434
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:09,827
of this rotten country!

435
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:24,258
General. There's smoke
coming from the storage room.

436
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:37,355
My lady.

437
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:47,656
Father?

438
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,159
This way.

439
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:56,415
Choi Jeongyeop is inside.

440
00:47:56,499 --> 00:47:57,792
Break the door!

441
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:28,989
That is not a map.
