00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:19,394
9 YEARS AGO
GYEONGWONJIN, HAMGYEONG PROVINCE

2
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:23,357
The barbarians!

3
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,918
1583
THE NITANGGAE REBELLION

4
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,003
The Jurchens are invading.

5
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:47,464
Close the gate now! Deploy our forces!

6
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:27,546
Do not fear!

7
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,299
Stay strong! Guard your posts!

8
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,462
Siyul.

9
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,436
Mama. Mom.

10
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,480
You need to keep quiet.

11
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,043
Stay back! Stay back!

12
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,511
You damn wretches.

13
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,771
Filthy little worms!

14
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:01,533
Fuck!

15
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:02,951
No! Mom!

16
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,453
You maggots!

17
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,446
Mom?

18
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,420
Mom.

19
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,258
Mom.

20
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:49,140
Chun! This child is still alive.

21
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,228
I can hear him breathing. He's breathing.

22
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:43,486
The Murky Stream

23
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:48,074
THREE. A STRONG NEW MAN

24
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,077
Find them!

25
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,247
Find them!

26
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:40,627
Hey! Do you realize
who you just beat up back there?

27
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,920
Who?

28
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:45,006
He was the second son of Jo Daein,
the Uiju county magistrate.

29
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,051
Was that funny?

30
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,928
Does having such a title,

31
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,681
allow you to harass women
like he does?

32
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:54,933
Goodbye to the real world.

33
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,518
Now!

34
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:03,650
Easy there, huh.

35
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,881
Watch your back.

36
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:28,383
You're too slow.

37
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,806
-Watch your own back.
-Hey.

38
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,100
Let's go!

39
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,351
Let's go! Come on!

40
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,521
Get them!

41
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,692
Do you think they're already here?

42
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,861
Get behind if you're scared.

43
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,449
Now!

44
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,867
Let's see who cracks first.

45
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:02,167
You want a government job.
But you are always fighting like this.

46
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,461
You know how blunt Siyul can be.

47
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,713
I told you to help him steer clear
of trouble.

48
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,593
What if
the two of you end up getting arrested?

49
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,845
Forget passing the state exam, then.

50
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,889
Let alone the military exam!

51
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,976
Just how thoughtless can you be?

52
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,148
Siyul, you're next.

53
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:28,193
-What?
-Come here.

54
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,824
Ow!

55
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,161
Your chance.

56
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,537
I deeply regret

57
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:40,663
what I--

58
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,833
-Please!
-Quit your whining and stand right here.

59
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,168
Right now!

60
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,214
-Sorry! Sorry! Mother!
-Look at you! Be a man!

61
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,508
When are you gonna grow up?

62
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,010
- When are you gonna grow up?
- Is anyone at home?

63
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:02,310
What kind of trouble are you in now?

64
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:06,523
Huh?

65
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,236
Good evening. We are from Nokmyeongso.

66
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,154
What does that mean?

67
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,740
We evaluate
the applicants' qualifications.

68
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:18,201
Does a Jang Siyul reside here?

69
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,164
Are you Jang Siyul, then?

70
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:24,958
Yes.

71
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,588
Is your grandmother Oksan Hwang Clan,

72
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,799
name Jaun?

73
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,634
Is that correct?

74
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,555
Yes. That's correct.

75
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:44,519
What's wrong?
Is there a problem here?

76
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,105
She remarried, according to the records.

77
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,401
Due to that, you are not qualified
to take the exam.

78
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,696
Wait. What do you mean by that?

79
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,824
Choosing to remarry is considered
inappropriate behavior.

80
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:03,079
As a result, her descendants,
any children or grandchildren,

81
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,249
are barred from taking the state exam.

82
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,086
I'm surprised
your mother never explained this to you.

83
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,381
I lost her when I was a child.

84
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,384
I was too young.

85
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,809
Here. Take it.

86
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:29,522
JANG SIYUL

87
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:36,196
You're stopping him from taking the exam
just because his grandmother remarried?

88
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,781
It's unfortunate. We're only messengers.

89
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:39,866
DENIED QUALIFICATION

90
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,784
If you think the decision is unfair,

91
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,162
you can appeal the government
to reconsider.

92
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,538
Well, then.

93
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,708
Wait, sir! Sir!

94
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:53,046
You could get a recommendation
from the district magistrate.

95
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,672
Then, we will reconsider.

96
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,510
Magistrate! Magistrate sir!

97
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,389
Your subject is requesting
an audience, sir!

98
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:06,517
How can you just stay inside?

99
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:10,188
I just want a chance to take the exam.
Is that really so much to ask?

100
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,148
How many must we tell you, no?

101
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,816
You leave me no choice!

102
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,237
I'll see what the problem is.

103
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,989
How dare you!
Have you no manners?

104
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,909
Magistrate!
Are you listening in there, sir?

105
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:26,120
As a child, war came for us.

106
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,501
We faced an attack from the barbarians!

107
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:35,380
You officials were the first
to abandon their posts.

108
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,298
People kept screaming at them for help.

109
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:42,011
And one by one, they were cut down
with the sword.

110
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,765
That's what happened to my poor mother!

111
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:49,352
You officials, the barbarians,

112
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,896
how can you say one is any better
than the other?

113
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,190
- Come here.
- Magistrate!

114
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,651
It seems this savage...

115
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,029
doesn't know how to be grateful.

116
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,574
-Tear his tongue out.
-Punish this ingrate.

117
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,083
You would hit an unarmed man?
What kind of officials are you?

118
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:17,755
I wanted to be an official to...

119
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,675
protect the weak and--

120
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,765
I couldn't save my mother's life.

121
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,184
I wanted to be an official...

122
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,855
so I can protect my family!

123
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,487
If the country abandons the people,

124
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,698
then who are we supposed to believe in!

125
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:56,127
Everything's the same. Nothing changed.

126
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,584
<i>Should I call him a tiger</i>
<i>caught in a trap,</i>

127
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,962
or a dhole running wild?

128
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:44,258
It seems he caused quite the commotion.

129
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,344
<i>He injured a number of soldiers.</i>

130
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,138
-And then...
-What?

131
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,598
It happened.

132
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:55,394
-He got himself in real trouble.
-He killed someone, didn't he?

133
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:58,356
No! Too obvious. Use this.

134
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,316
-That boy...
-Yeah.

135
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,569
set fire to the official buildings there.

136
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:12,120
And every single one of them
set aflame instantly.

137
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:13,621
- Fire!
<i>- If he's caught,</i>

138
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,414
<i>-he'll be decapitated anywhere.</i>
-Fire!

139
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,961
While everyone was busy
putting the fire out,

140
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,421
someone dragged Jang Siyul out of there.

141
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,632
<i>A masked man, or so they say.</i>

142
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,343
<i>And the man who took him...</i>

143
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,221
His brother, though not his blood,

144
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,224
Jung Chun, they say,

145
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,561
at least according to the rumors,
you know?

146
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,189
It's upside down.

147
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:45,653
So this Jung Chun,

148
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,156
<i>is it the same as that one?</i>

149
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,532
Ah!

150
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,660
It's just a rumor.
There's no way to know for sure.

151
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,120
-Shit!
-Come here.

152
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,081
It's suspicious, though, isn't it?

153
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:59,208
Look here.

154
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,170
The name of the sender written here,

155
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,965
the newly appointed assistant officer.

156
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,593
And where is he from?

157
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,387
Hamgyeong.

158
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:31,991
You...

159
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,409
You need to turn around.

160
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,161
Siyul...

161
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,705
The state test will be soon, brother.

162
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:39,957
If you don't make it,

163
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,169
I can never face Mother again.

164
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,255
Go now.

165
00:16:56,807 --> 00:17:00,019
You need to run far from here.

166
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,191
You need to survive, understand?

167
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,985
One day, the world will change.

168
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,445
Keep going.

169
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,323
Until that day.

170
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,753
Today is Mother's <i>Jesa.</i>

171
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:12,508
She was brave even when she was dragged
to the government office and tortured.

172
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,093
But then last winter,

173
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,929
she got sick and passed away.

174
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,224
And it was all my fault.

175
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,479
I shouldn't have gone as wild as I did.

176
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,023
Siyul,

177
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,152
we are not just friends.

178
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,448
We're brothers.

179
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,908
Don't forget to hold Mother's <i>Jesa.</i>

180
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:46,751
I plan on leaving for the border soon.

181
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,127
Why the border?

182
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:51,130
There is a war going on right now.

183
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,132
If I distinguish myself,

184
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,469
I heard my charges could get cleared.

185
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,720
You can't.

186
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,139
You could die in a battle.

187
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,891
You're an official.

188
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,435
And I'm a criminal.

189
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:07,188
Staying here
would expose you to more danger.

190
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,440
I had a wish...

191
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:14,445
to see you again before I died,
and here we are.

192
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:18,866
I got my wish.

193
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:31,462
Siyul.

194
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,426
Please...

195
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:42,181
be a good official.

196
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,101
Please.

197
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,226
Where are you off to?

198
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,317
Come work for me.

199
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,862
I'm Park Mudeok.

200
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,573
If you let me, I can change your life.

201
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,202
You should mind your own business.

202
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,332
You'd be wise to take my hand, eh?

203
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,504
Jang Siyul!

204
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,763
Jang Siyul, right?

205
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,061
Jang Siyul!

206
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,522
You're Jang Siyul, aren't you?

207
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,567
They wouldn't let you take the state exam,

208
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,820
so you charged into the office,
and you burned it all down.

209
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,991
I don't know anyone around here
who would think to pull that shit.

210
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:28,245
That's great. Good job.

211
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,539
How did you know?

212
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,249
What's it matter how?

213
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,836
What matters is that the two of us
are together now.

214
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,379
What do you want from me, then?

215
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:41,842
The Mapo territory can be ours

216
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,095
with your brute strength

217
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,765
and your courage.

218
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,725
The way I look at it,

219
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,229
you were always meant to be a bandit.

220
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,482
I'm not interested in being a bandit.

221
00:21:58,234 --> 00:21:59,652
Nor am I cut out for it.

222
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,570
I get to decide that.

223
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,823
Just report me to the officials, then.

224
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:05,699
What?

225
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:08,118
I only carried on because I didn't die.

226
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,247
I'm going now.

227
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,584
Go ahead.
Report me if that's what you want.

228
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,628
I don't care what you do.

229
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,591
Really?

230
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,805
All right, fine.

231
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:36,313
Wait. What about Jung Chun?

232
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:39,567
He helped you escape

233
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,777
when you set the government office
on fire.

234
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,238
On top of getting you out of there,

235
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,907
he now holds
an assistant officer position.

236
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:51,620
Now, what if I were to go
and report that to the officials, huh?

237
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,167
I don't know what you're talking about.

238
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:59,378
You don't know him, you say?

239
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,048
I saw something in your bundle.

240
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:04,633
Huh?

241
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,386
Was it a letter?

242
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:22,151
Is it still in there, you idiot?

243
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,574
If you don't give it back,

244
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,702
I really will kill you.

245
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,204
Go ahead.

246
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,541
Just do it.

247
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,503
Where would that letter end up if I die?

248
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:43,213
The police will wanna see it.

249
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:44,798
Huh?

250
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:52,681
Wow! Look at those damn eyes.

251
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,516
What did I tell ya?

252
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,604
You were always meant to be a bandit.

253
00:23:58,687 --> 00:23:59,688
Huh?

254
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,194
You're wrong.

255
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:10,032
-That's not who I am.
-Hey.

256
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,909
If you listen to me,

257
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:14,620
you'll live.

258
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:17,206
And your friend will live, too.

259
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:20,751
What? You don't like it?

260
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,047
All right, then.

261
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,132
Never mind.

262
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,476
What do you want me to do for you?

263
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:39,937
You see,

264
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:44,316
I don't like to offer my hand
to someone who already turned me down.

265
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,901
Got it?

266
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:50,030
But for you? For you, I'll let it slide.

267
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:58,580
Grab it.

268
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:02,459
What are you waiting for?

269
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:06,463
Grab my foot.

270
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:28,861
Remember this, okay?

271
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:31,989
This right here.

272
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,284
This is where we stand.

273
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,495
You hear me?

274
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,414
My friend.

275
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,751
If anything happens to him,

276
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,466
I really will kill you.

277
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,135
Oh, shit.

278
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,137
You're scaring me, kid.

279
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,687
Hey.

280
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:08,400
I don't make it a habit of saying this
to other men.

281
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,739
You're mine from here on out.

282
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,910
Got it?

283
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:28,462
Captain Park?

284
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,298
- Captain Park?
- Yes?

285
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,804
The barn is short a few horses.

286
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:38,806
Horses?

287
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:41,558
I bring this issue up
because it says there are 20 in here.

288
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:43,310
In the barn, there were only three.

289
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:46,063
Well, I... I wasn't the one
who kept the ledger.

290
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,606
I wouldn't know about that.

291
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:50,734
Captain, you have to know
what the status of the horses are.

292
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:53,654
Officer Jung, I am highly disappointed.

293
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:56,281
There may be mistakes
due to heavy workloads.

294
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:59,326
I swear to the heavens,
I have no reason for remorse.

295
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:15,425
The armory looks empty as well.

296
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,261
Is this everything?

297
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:20,139
Why are you picking everything apart?

298
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:23,517
What's wrong?
You've not enjoyed your stay?

299
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,352
I'm not picking on anything.

300
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:28,939
It's just that it's a far cry
from the logbooks you've been submitting.

301
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:51,169
Why are all the swords and spears rusted
like this?

302
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:54,047
Rust can always be cleaned.

303
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:57,384
-I think you can lighten up a little.
-Can you bring the hwapo here?

304
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:00,220
It's been a while since we cleaned it.

305
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:02,180
I don't know if it'll fire at this point.

306
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,198
The armory is empty.

307
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:22,618
Neither the rations nor the horses
match the ledger.

308
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:26,496
At this point, if war breaks out,
we'll be absolutely helpless here.

309
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,915
Insolent!

310
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,880
That kind of arrogance
can get us in trouble here.

311
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:39,134
We are not the ones to take measures.

312
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,219
That authority is the General's,

313
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:43,639
far greater than where our powers lie.

314
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,474
Then I'll take it to the General

315
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,101
so I can seek real measures.

316
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,148
Sure, go right ahead.

317
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,900
He's not there, though.

318
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:00,072
Don't you remember?

319
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:04,368
We're throwing you a welcome party today.

320
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:06,453
Guests are coming from Hanseong City.

321
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,455
I already told you to be ready for it.

322
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:13,168
For goodness' sake!
How did you place first in the exam?

323
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:42,072
Consider me nothing more
than a mere woodpecker.

324
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,116
I just peck, your Grace, if you allow me.

325
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:48,078
I wish you nothing but the best, General.

326
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,372
I knew it.

327
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,583
You're the only one in our bureau
who works hard,

328
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,419
and the only reveler as well.

329
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,629
You sincerely honor me, General.

330
00:29:57,713 --> 00:30:01,008
Now we have a newly appointed officer.

331
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:03,802
And as per tradition,
we shall drink from the bottle.

332
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,303
So let us celebrate.

333
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,723
All right.

334
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:09,975
Here!

335
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,561
To unending loyalty

336
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,938
and endless alcohol.

337
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:17,357
To us, the military!

338
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:27,284
Here, here, here,
here, here, here!

339
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,661
Now that this old man's danced his dance,

340
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:32,414
it's only right that the young man dances.

341
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:39,004
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Come on! Show us your moves!

342
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,213
Here.

343
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:42,049
Oh!

344
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,468
Would you look at that?

345
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,350
What a pretty official!

346
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,811
What exactly is the meaning of this?

347
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:59,608
You dare?

348
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:03,653
Our young official here
isn't excited enough!

349
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:06,281
He needs to dance!

350
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,833
Here we go!

351
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,883
Look at this.

352
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:27,761
What kind of military official
can't hold his liquor?

353
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:33,058
Goodness!
I worry about the future of this country.

354
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,436
We agree about that.

355
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,981
They say a fish rots from the head, but...

356
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:43,443
I struggle to find a spot in this city
that doesn't smell.

357
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:46,905
You can stop your lofty speech now.
Head on inside.

358
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,450
I experienced war as a young boy.

359
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,704
The soldiers were no different then.

360
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:58,458
Passing the time by drinking,
and they were always the first to run.

361
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:05,340
Who is it that protects the commoners
if the officials care only for pleasure?

362
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:13,265
What an arrogant assistant officer
we have here.

363
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:17,769
Looking after the people isn't what we do.

364
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:20,021
We're only here to protect His Majesty.

365
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:21,648
Protecting the citizenry?

366
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,860
That's the king's authority,
so that's his purview.

367
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,237
Are you the king now?

368
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:29,573
Do you want his position?

369
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,661
This kid.

370
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,001
You should watch your mouth, all right?

371
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:44,588
Getting outed as a traitor
doesn't take a lot.

372
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:54,806
Wow.

373
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,183
Eat up.

374
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:57,893
-Thank you so much
-Let me try that.

375
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,563
Yeah.

376
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:08,028
You look like you're a decent man.
Why are you with these good-for-nothings?

377
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:17,329
Your life must have been nice and cushy.

378
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,497
How else could you be so good with those?

379
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:22,125
I know.
You use chopsticks like a nobleman.

380
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:23,460
Very classy.

381
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:26,129
Ah! I need to learn how to do that.

382
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:36,097
Oh! Just...

383
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:40,143
By the way, we all know that there's
a pecking order in this class.

384
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:42,062
Am I not next after you?

385
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,731
Isn't it wrong that the new boy
gets to sit here?

386
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:45,982
It's wrong.

387
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:48,193
Well, then fight for it.

388
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,486
Huh? What?

389
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:53,031
I mean, if you win, you're the boss,
and if you lose you're the underling.

390
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,199
That's right.

391
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:57,244
He's about to get his teeth knocked out.

392
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:59,537
Let's see it.
Brother, you should fight him.

393
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,915
Uh, no, no, no.
All of you need to be quiet.

394
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,251
We can't fight. We're--

395
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,711
Look at him.

396
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:10,006
-He's a flincher.
-Look at this stuck-up jackass.

397
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:14,177
My name's Walwal, by the way.

398
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:19,557
I'm the youngest. Malbok.

399
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:22,269
Call me Jungbok.
I read the room and talk fast.

400
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,271
I'm Gaechun.

401
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:33,071
Open up. Ah!

402
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:35,615
Oh? Well...

403
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,703
How old are you? It's just...

404
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,623
Wait. What do you want to know that for?

405
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:47,085
Uh, I mean, I think you look older.

406
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:50,547
I wouldn't say I'm much older.

407
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:54,301
Besides,
seniority isn't set by age here.

408
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,303
It's set by the fist.

409
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:58,597
Still, that's a bit...

410
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:00,932
By the way, what's your name?

411
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:10,150
It's Siyul. Jang Siyul.

412
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,110
-Oh!
-Siyul.

413
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,904
Your name, even that's classy.

414
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,906
So classy.

415
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,160
-And he burned down a building.
-Huh?

416
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:22,037
Arson of a government office.

417
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,788
Really?

418
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:26,082
-Everything was burned to the ground.
-Wow.

419
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:29,753
I never would have expected that.

420
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:30,962
Now, that is a man.

421
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,299
I didn't realize
what a brave person you are.

422
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:37,886
I hope that you can forgive me, brother.

423
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,221
That is a man.

424
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:42,766
That's a real man!

425
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,559
Brother,

426
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:48,104
-I have to respect that.
-Me too.

427
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:49,564
See that, huh?

428
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:52,359
You are meant to be a bandit.

429
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,446
I'll be the forefinger again.

430
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:02,911
I'll lie on silk bedding
and piss in a golden chamber pot, huh?

431
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,163
-Gold chamber pot? Oh, yeah?
-Hey, hey.

432
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:07,123
When you're walking around town, huh,

433
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:09,167
you spot a tile-roof house,
claim that shit.

434
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,794
How about the one over there?

435
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,087
I know.

436
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,797
What about Gyeongbokgung Palace?

437
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,548
That'd be a nice place to buy.

438
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:18,134
If the King puts it on the market,
I'll snatch it.

439
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,681
Here. Eat a lot.

440
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,308
Keep your eyes fierce,

441
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:29,145
'cause tomorrow,
I'll be the forefinger again.

442
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,773
Don't we have wine? Go and get it.

443
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,441
Wait. What does that mean?

444
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:35,568
We're drinking tonight!

445
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:43,702
Five majigi of rice paddy,
and three majigi of farmland in Anseong.

446
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:47,038
This much will suffice as collateral.

447
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:49,582
We can lend up to 200 nyang.

448
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:52,210
You have until the second day
of next year.

449
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:55,004
We need to receive the full amount
plus additional interest.

450
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,090
Do you understand?

451
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,467
Yes, I understand.

452
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,178
I'll need your signature up front.

453
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,813
The money we lent.
How much was it all together?

454
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:14,774
Uh...

455
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:17,235
Sampo Market
and the Gyeonggang River combined

456
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:20,697
is around 270,000 nyang.

457
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,199
Don't forget
the promissory notes.

458
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,703
There are about 500,000 nyang.

459
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,538
Including guilds in other regions,

460
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:31,040
and if we factor in
all the small merchants,

461
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,710
the math is sound to me.

462
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,670
And then, we have to pay the government.

463
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:38,840
That's a little more than five hal.

464
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:41,301
If we could spend half of that,

465
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,386
we could build a few more bridges here.

466
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:45,889
Tomorrow is a busy day.

467
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,016
We're sending Seokchon their items.

468
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,185
We must load before the sunrise.

469
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,897
Do try to get some sleep, young lady.

470
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:04,324
Getting some fresh air?

471
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,702
How do you think Eun
is taking to the trade?

472
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,037
From what I can see,

473
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,498
I'd say your daughter was born for this.

474
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,708
Are you saying she is talented?

475
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:16,878
She inherited your blood
right down to her bones.

476
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:18,671
I see.

477
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:21,925
She and I were cut from the same cloth,
is that it?

478
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,968
I didn't mean to say that.

479
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,555
It's fine.

480
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,933
Who could know her any better than I?

481
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:33,102
I approve of her.

482
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:35,980
Make sure the dawn duty is on schedule.

483
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:37,732
I'll ensure it is done.

484
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:55,667
My lady!

485
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:59,003
My lady!

486
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:02,465
My lady, you must come. There's a problem.

487
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:13,893
What happened?

488
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:16,437
Another guild paid the rush charge,
my lady.

489
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,064
So, the order was moved around.

490
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:20,233
We need those laborers.

491
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:23,152
It's their scheme.
This is how the bandits cheat us.

492
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:28,491
As of now, the bandits are blocking
our loading crew.

493
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:32,036
-I will speak to them, then.
-My lady, there would be no point.

494
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:35,707
-Surely they'll listen to reason.
-Bandits are not capable of diplomacy.

495
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:39,419
For the boat to leave on time,
we must load now.

496
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,671
If we don't move at once,

497
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:44,549
we will lose our items and our integrity.

498
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:50,680
I recommend paying the charge.
It will resolve all of this.

499
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:57,103
Do you know how many laborers we have?

500
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,479
Why do you ask?

501
00:39:58,563 --> 00:39:59,731
We don't have time now.

502
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:03,443
We will load the boat with our laborers.

503
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:06,529
My lady, it would be unwise
to provoke the bandits.

504
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:08,740
This problem is bigger than money.

505
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,533
You must know that, too.

506
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,706
Summon all the laborers we can.

507
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,793
Prepare some torches as well.

508
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,008
I will try, my lady.

509
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:32,513
All right. Everyone, gather around.

510
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:34,015
Yes.

511
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:42,023
From here on, we will do this ourselves.
We will load the items directly.

512
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:44,067
Now, then.

513
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:48,905
What are they doing?

514
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,991
-Hey, Walwal.
-Huh?

515
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,535
Do we have money for the torch charge?

516
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:56,829
- They didn't.
- Oh!

517
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:59,791
So they think they can just pull one
over on us.

518
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,420
Here.

519
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:13,346
Hey! Put those torches down now!

520
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,308
What do you think you're doing?

521
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:21,688
Who the fuck thinks they can work my port
without paying the damn torch charge?

522
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:27,402
The torches we're using are ours,
and we brought our own oil.

523
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,737
So tell me,
why do I have to pay you for that?

524
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:32,115
What are you blabbering about,
little girl?

525
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:36,077
Maybe I'm getting old because
I don't understand a word you're saying.

526
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,038
Mudeok, we're in a rush.

527
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:40,873
Let it slide this once.

528
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:43,001
Chief Kang, you already know.

529
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,839
If you pay a lot,
that means you're very busy.

530
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,967
But if you don't,
you're only a little busy.

531
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:54,595
You've been around here long enough.
What's gotten into you?

532
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:00,226
Oh.

533
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:05,356
Don't tell me it's because
your new leader is this young lady.

534
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:08,234
So you wanna learn to trade?

535
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:14,741
I suggest you start by learning the rules
if you want to last around here.

536
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,161
Don't you agree?

537
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:24,667
She's scary? Look at that glare.

538
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,256
I am not interested
in playing along with bandits.

539
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,425
Oh, my.

540
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:40,600
All of you, grab your cargo and follow me.

541
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:43,853
- Right now!
- Don't move a muscle.

542
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:46,147
Do you want to get your legs broken?

543
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,441
If I see you move an inch, hmm,

544
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,777
I'll break your legs
right there on the spot.

545
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,445
-Okay?
-I welcome you to try.

546
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,823
But you'll face the consequences.

547
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,663
Don't stand there.

548
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:04,207
Go move the cargo.

549
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,714
Hurry. Do as Lady Eun says.

550
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:17,845
This might just be treasonous, bitch.

551
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:20,014
Hey, what should we do, brother?

552
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,603
Hey, come here.

553
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:30,525
Get over here.

554
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:45,081
Hmm.

555
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:47,667
I have a job for you.

556
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:51,963
You go and take the bitch's torch away.

557
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:00,888
Must we?

558
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:06,435
I thought I taught you to shut up
and do whatever I say.

559
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:10,982
Yet with each passing day,
you're just getting more arrogant.

560
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:14,610
Hey, did you forget I own you now?

561
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:16,821
I can make it so both you and your friend

562
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,781
lose your heads, yeah?

563
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:23,786
If you don't want that,
bring me that torch right away.

564
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:27,915
Just hold it.

565
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:29,959
Yeah. That's it.

566
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:37,216
How dare you! Halt!

567
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,635
Hey, you! Get back, will you?

568
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:41,429
Stay out of the way!

569
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:46,225
- Relax! Take it easy.
- Stop! Listen!

570
00:44:56,819 --> 00:45:00,489
I'm here... to take your torch.

571
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:03,826
If the guild keeps pressing ahead,

572
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,371
then the laborers here
cannot make a living.

573
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,956
They'll still make a living.

574
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:12,501
It's just that you won't be able
to rip anyone off.

575
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:17,340
It's no use complaining to me, my lady.

576
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,091
The torch.

577
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:26,682
What the hell is this shit?

578
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:30,311
Hey! Are you trying to court her?

579
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:33,439
Why aren't you restoring order?

580
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,436
Wow!

581
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,314
He's a bandit now, through and through.

582
00:46:20,653 --> 00:46:21,862
Listen up!

583
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:25,783
Our country's peace depends
on the bandit standing tall.

584
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:28,619
Put out that fire.

585
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,543
That's right.

586
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:36,711
Grab them all.

587
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:39,630
Put down the torches!

588
00:46:42,008 --> 00:46:43,968
Put out the fire, all of you.

589
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:46,429
Is this the justice you wanted?

590
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:50,516
I thought you were a hard worker.

591
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:53,811
But it turns out you're nothing
but a bloodsucking leech.

592
00:46:57,732 --> 00:46:58,733
Fine then.

593
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:04,030
Enjoy this life.
