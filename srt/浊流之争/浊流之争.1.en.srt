THE LARGE WATERWAY ACROSS HANYANG
WAS CALLED GYEONGGANG RIVER

4
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:14,598
THE MOST THRIVING AND BUSTLING DOCK

00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,433
[bandit 1] Hey, over here!

WITH THE CONSTANT INFLUX
OF BOATS AND MERCHANTS,

00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,981
MAPO DEVELOPED INTO A LARGE MARKETPLACE

10
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:24,107
[bandit 1] Hurry up.

11
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:26,818
Yeah, right here. Just drop it, okay.

12
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:28,654
Come on, get another load.

13
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,739
THE DOCK WAS OVERFLOWING
WITH MERCHANTS AND LABORERS,

[bandit 2] No, I'm here first. [laughs]

-[bandit 3] Hey...
-[bandit 1] Get going!

21

PEOPLE HAD TO PAY A TAX TO BANDITS
TO BE ALLOWED TO WORK.

-[bandit 4] Pay your selection tax.
-[bandit 5] Take your pass.

23

Without the pass, you can't work!

You put it over there.

34

[bandit 1] Hey, stop fighting.

44
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,794
You'll get your turn. Okay.

-Yeah.

47
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:12,924
I want more.

48

What now? What?

49
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,763
We only earn two doe of rice,

50
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,724
you take half of it back as tax.

51
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:24,102
The other half...
don't we at least deserve that?

52
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,521
Who are you to whine about anything?

53
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:28,231
-Huh?
-I need enough to eat.

54
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,276
How do you expect me to live on this?

55
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,237
Give me a full doe of rice.
As you promised.

56
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,449
You have all these complaints.

57
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:38,992
Go hit the drum and call.

Hey!

61
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,252
Anyone else thinks
this rice here isn't enough, huh?

62
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:55,384
If you can't work, don't work. [exhales]

63
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:59,930
Hey, go there. Take all his wages
and make sure he never comes back.

64

Listen carefully.

65

you're dead.

-Huh?

You son of a bitch.

69
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:14,986
-You better back away. This isn't yours!
-Why aren't you restoring order?

-Die!

Get away!

I'll cut you open.

77

Huh?

-[sighs] What's this?
-[worker] Try me!

79
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,544
Don't come any closer.

80
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,546
Don't! Stay away!

Are there any more complaints?

Or are we done here?

learn how to keep your big mouth shut!

105
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:39,988
Next.

106
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,075
Hurry up now.

[indistinct chatter]

110
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,550
[bandit 1] He's here.

Now...

116
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,190
Yoon goes first, let's see the taxes.

117
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,274
Yes, boss.

[Yoon sighs softly]

119
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,115
Hmm.

120
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,576
Mapo remains as peaceful as ever,
it seems.

-[all chuckling]
-That's good.

122
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:33,416
And tomorrow
we can all expect a sunny day.

123
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,918
[all] Yes, boss.

Two pil of cotton, boss.

126

Look at you, Bang,
you've settled in quick.

127
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,513
-[Bang] It's all thanks to you.
-[inhales deeply]

128
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,024
This is silk, boss.

129
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,360
Dongmak, you little shit!

130
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,697
Got a handle on it now, huh?

131
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,241
[all laughing]

132
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,201
[bandit leader] Yes.

133
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,203
[laughs]

134
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,584
[grunts]

135
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,595
What is this?

136
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:30,932
Sorry to say, boss, Mudeok is quite short.

137
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,851
He only has half the tax here.

138
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,020
Uh, not quite. Uh...

139
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,439
[stammers] Why do you have to say that?

140
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,399
It was that Officer Park prick,

141
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,569
he took a whole mal of rice...
and messed up our...

142
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,238
Shut up and pay your taxes
or else you're a traitor.

143
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,157
[gasps] There's no reason to go there.

144
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,826
I was already gonna
get it all later. [chuckles]

145
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,536
-So it's...
-You can delay death,

146
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,121
but can't avoid taxes.

147
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,708
Oh, hey, don't tell me you're also
gonna weigh in on this.

148
00:06:56,791 --> 00:07:00,712
You better offer up your clothes...
to make up for the missing tax.

149
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,922
That's the rule, no?

150
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:06,259
Are you suggesting I loosen the sash
and walk around naked like this?

151
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,136
[laughs]

152
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,472
I must say, my dear younger brother,

153
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,308
your wit truly has no equal. [laughs]

154
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:16,895
[all laughing]

155
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,150
Feeling shy?

156
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,694
Should I untie it for you, then?

157
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:25,779
[all laughing]

158
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,036
[â™ª Ominous music playing]

159
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,497
Listen, kid...

160
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,876
you better cut it out.

161
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,588
It wouldn't be a good idea
to get on my nerves.

162
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,465
[clicks tongue]

163
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,843
[chuckling] Let's be careful
with our words now. [laughs]

164
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:49,928
You can stop.

165
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:54,182
You can stop trying to act tough in front
of the boys before you regret it.

166
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,477
You're an old man
who can't fight for shit.

167
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,188
Son of a bitch!
Watch your mouth or I'll...

168
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,399
[â™ª ominous music continues]

169
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,570
You got a death wish?

170
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,993
Look here, huh?

171
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:18,081
You all know I've been a bandit so long
that my bones have hardened to steel.

172
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,458
-[scoffs]
-Respect your elders.

173
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:21,710
[laughs]

174
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,962
-Boss.
-What is it?

175
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,296
At times like this,

176
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:29,509
it's custom to settle things
with a proper fight to restore order.

177
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,971
Our new recruits are all watching.
I hate to set a bad example.

178
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,264
Think of their discipline.

Mudeok.

181
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,813
Ah. [stammers] Yes? [sniffles]

182
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,690
What do you make of this challenge?

183
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,818
Are you willing to fight him?

184
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,487
Oh, wait, Boss,
[stammers] I wouldn't even think

185
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,948
of fighting a baby still wet
from the mother's womb.

186
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:55,035
-That wouldn't be fair. [laughs]
-Sounds like you're scared.

187
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,328
What's wrong?

188
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,457
You said you had bones of steel.

192
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,770
Come on, you piece of shit.

193
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,939
-[bandit] How is this gonna turn out?
-Let's go.

194
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,941
Let's take this outside, huh?

195
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,736
Brother, is this really what you want?

196
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,863
You're a pathetic son of a bitch.

197
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,198
You're dead now!

198
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,366
You don't even know
how fucking dead you are.

199
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,993
Okay!

200
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:38,870
[both grunting]

201
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:40,914
Now what are we waiting for?

202
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,540
Let's take this outside, asshole!

-Kids are adults.

229

[grunting] They don't listen...

230
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,143
until they've had a beating.

231
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,938
[bandits shouting] Hit him!

-[Bang grunting]
-Stop!

238
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,952
Brother, come out here and fight.

-[whimpering]
-[Bang laughing]

240

Have it your way.

-[whimpers, screams]
-[yells]

243
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,671
Are you out of your mind, Mudeok?

244
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:54,923
What's wrong with you?

245
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,507
Why don't you shut your mouth?

246
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:57,592
[clicks tongue]

247
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,637
Did you forget already, huh?

248
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,764
If Deokgae stopped
the fight a minute later,

249
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,725
you'd be up there in heaven
right now with your ancestors.

250
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:09,229
Who was it that restored order
to Maponaru, damn it?

251
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,648
It was all thanks Deokgae and me,
the two of us.

252
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,568
Now those scavengers and insects
are trying to steal my spot.

253
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:17,195
You just watch.

254
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,698
I'll wipe the floor with Bang and Yoon.
Then I'll be the forefinger again.

255
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,200
[sighs in exasperation]

256
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,160
Wow, what ambition you got?

257
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:28,248
[sighs] Why would anyone wanna be
the forefinger instead of the thumb?

258
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,124
-You're crazy.
-Hey!

259
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,794
You gotta learn that men like us
will only go so far.

260
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,504
Chief State Councilor at best.

261
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,839
Huh? Going for the crown,
though, is treason.

262
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,468
I always knew your ambitions were small.

263
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,513
-I didn't know they were this...
-[both grunting]

264

Hey, you! With the hat!

266
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,106
[man sighs] Damn it.

267
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:56,276
Come here. Come on over.

[â™ª Ominous music playing]

269
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,074
What was that?

270

[gulps]

271
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:18,965

[scoffs]

273
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,606
You are nothing but a fool.

00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,530
[gulps]

275
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,913
[sighs] That piece of shit. [grunts]

276
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,416
Did you see how scared he was?

277
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,001
Brother, wait.

278
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:58,004
Those people,
they don't look like they're from here.

279
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:02,592
You little shits.

280

[â™ª Playful music playing]

281
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,015
-[sniffles]
-None of you can fight.

282
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,225
None of you have any guts.

283
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,479
Weaklings, all of you.

284
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,356
Just get out of the fucking way!

285
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:21,277
No one's in your way, though.
I mean, you could...

286
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,280
[Mudeok sighs]

287
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,117
Oh, right, Mudeok.

288
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,870
While we're out here,
let's find you something to wear.

289
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,164
If you show up shirtless again,

290
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,249
your wife's gonna beat you
to death tonight.

291
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,376
Who will beat their husband
like that, huh?

292
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,629
I'll throw her out in the streets.

293
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,300
Get out! You refuse to touch your wife

294
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,136
-but you run around naked, huh?
-[Mudeok whimpering]

295
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,472
[wife] Why don't you
take your clothes off for me?

296
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,474
How dare you hit your husband like that?

297
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,600
You'll regret this!

298
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,352
Get back here. You...

299
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,896
Forget the day job,
at least do your night job!

Fine, then! Run!

What brings you all the way
here today, brother Bang?

313

Look at you, lounging around
without a care in the world.

Oh's guild needs 10 men to carry rice.

315

Oh. [stammers] They told me
to put the salt first, though.

316

When the higher-ups
tell you to do something,

317
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,454
you better do it instead
of talking so much. Yeah?

318
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,791

00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,137
Hey, Mudeok, what's going on here?

353
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,764
[sighs] Now what's wrong?

354
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,307
This isn't the correct order.

355
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,017
The salt should be unloaded first.

356
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:43,062
[sighs in exasperation]
I just do whatever I'm told to do.

357
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,940
When it comes to the order,
I have no say in that.

358
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,817
I docked my boat half a day ago.

359
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,070
How can you ignore that
and unload the rice before the salt?

360
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,240
[groans] Look, it's not me
that makes the decision, huh?

361
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,158
-[sighs]
-If you've got a problem,

362
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,369
go find the higher-ups
and ask them what to do.

363
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,453
Good grief.

364
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,414
[grunts]

365
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,500
That bastard, he's still showing
his face around here.

366
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,335
Shit.

367
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,087
Hey! You!

368
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,463
[panting] Damn it.

369
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,507
-Here! [grunts]
-[worker grunts]

370
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:14,802
Hey, what did I tell you, huh?

371
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,596
You can't work here anymore.

372
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:17,888
Please allow me to work.

373
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:20,099
I will never complain
about the wage again.

374
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,191
-[chuckling] Wait, are you crazy?
-[bandit sighs]

375
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,235
Yoon, we have to talk.

376
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:34,488
We docked three days ago,
I was pushed back again.

377
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,282
That's supposed to mean something?

378
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,658
Clouds are forming.

379
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:40,328
And? Stay patient and wait your turn.

380
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,997
If it starts to pour,
I could lose over half the salt.

381
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,416
-[Yoon] Shut up, you idiot.
-[all laughing]

382
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,753
Look here, young man. [sighs]

383
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,796
Mapo has always had certain customs.

384
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,132
We know
it's always been first in, first out.

385
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,092
Hey, look. Listen.

386
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:57,011
[bandit grunting]

387
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,513
It's not like
I'm the one who makes the law.

388
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:02,308
[bandits all laughing]

389
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,935
We are not passing any laws. Right, boys?

390
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,313
[laughter continues]

391
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,315
I want to talk to your boss, then.

392
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:13,194
[Yoon] The esteemed Chief Kang
is gonna head up.

393
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,196
[bandit] One more shot. [laughing]

394
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:27,875
Lord Deokgae.

395
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,421
[scoffs] What do you mean by "lord"?

396
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,382
The real lord will be disappointed.

397
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,050
Hmm.

398
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,970
Would you move up my turn in line?

399
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:42,348
I'm carrying salt,
I'll be in trouble if it rains.

400
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,308
When rain's involved...

401
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,727
everyone's in a hurry.

402
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:47,812
Are they not?

403
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:49,939
[laughs]

404
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,732
[man sighs]

405
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,944
Now that's a despicable tactic.

406
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,117
That covers the rush charge.

407
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:03,119
Can you please hurry?

408
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,788
Yoon, you hear that?

409
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,039
I hear you, Boss.

410
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:09,083
Chief Kang should be rushed ahead.

411
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,169
Got a rush order in for Choi's guild!

412
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:13,337
Much appreciated.

413
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,172
You take care now.

414
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,431
So you shift the order
and they pay a charge.

415
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,225
A rain charge for the rain.

416
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,936
A flood charge if there's a flood.

417
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,939
[scoffs] And the commoners'
blood and sweat,

418
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,316
you make sure to squeeze them dry.

419
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,026
Let's compare, then.

420
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,155
That's nothing.

421
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,574
A drop of piss in the Gyeonggang River.

422
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,325
An inspection charge for inspecting.

423
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,786
A training charge for training.

424
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:49,874
A charge for new assignments
and another charge for leaving.

425
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,126
[chuckles]

426
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:55,671
The amount
that we're squeezed by our lords,

427
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,632
we don't have a drop of sweat left either.

428
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:00,342
[laughs]

429
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,720
Not a drop, huh?

430
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,681
-[both laughing]
-Not a drop left, you say.

431
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,767
-Not a drop.
-[both laughing]

432
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,897
[grunts]

433
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,523
[â™ª Ominous music playing]

434
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,988
[breath trembles]

435
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,491
I could tear you apart right now.

436
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:26,577
I show a bit of mercy
and he walks all over me.

437
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,870
Is that it?

438
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,414
No, I would never. My lord, I wasn't...

439
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:32,875
Then why do you speak when I'm speaking?

440
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,044
Come here.

441
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,799
Closer.

442
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,343
[grunts]

443
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,514
If you do not watch your tongue...

444
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:49,975
-[trembling]
-you could die.

445
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:52,311
Without a doubt, my lord.

446
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,479
[breath trembling]

447
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,567
[bowl thuds]

448
00:21:58,651 --> 00:21:59,652
[sighs]

449
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,532
[rice wine trickling]

450
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:09,537
Drink it.

451
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:13,624
Oh.

452
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,751
All right, yes, thank you.

453
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,420
[gulping]

454
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:22,842
[laughing]

455
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:25,052
[retching]

456
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:31,684
[coughs]

457
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,728
[laughing] What a fool. I was just joking.

458
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:38,566
You were so scared.

459
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:40,234
[continues laughing]

460
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,528
-Hey! Pour me a glass.
-Yes.

461
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:43,863
Of course, my lord. Yes.

462
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,906
[both laughing]

463
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:46,991
[crickets chirping]

464
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:53,163
Good evening, sir. Allow me to enter.

465
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,385
We finished. Everything's been unloaded.

466
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,138
You paid a rush charge, I heard.

467
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:10,806
I had to pay.

468
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,560
[scoffs] On top of everything else,
a rush charge.

469
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,061
Those thieving bastards.

470
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:18,105
-Father.
-[sighs]

471
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,066
The bandits are only petty thieves.

472
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,777
They're just someone else's tools.

473
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:27,573
The real issue is the officials
who sit around milking the rewards

474
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,491
of their corruption from the shadows.

475
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:30,659
[sighs]

476
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:32,786
What's this nonsense?
Have you been drinking?

477
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,872
We know the bandits
are reporting to someone.

478
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,081
[man] Silence, you fool.

479
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:37,666
You should know when to stop.

480
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,627
[sighs] We're only merchants.

481
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:43,923
Words like those will bring us trouble,
so we ought to be careful.

482
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,215
[sighs] That's why...

483
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,676
That's why I need to become an official.

484
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,888
You can't be an official
if you don't even pass the exam.

485
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,641
You've been saying
you'd pass for 10 years now.

486
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:56,268
-[sighs]
-It's time you learned the trade.

487
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:58,395
[inhales sharply]

488
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:01,607
That life isn't for me.

489
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,691
[inhales]

490
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,443
If one is born as a man,

491
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:07,363
it's his duty to rise to office
in order to rule the world.

492
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:09,198
Wouldn't you agree?

493
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:11,492
[sighs]

494
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:15,204
My one and only son, a rainbow chaser.

495
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:16,830
There's more, sir.

496
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:18,916
I checked the storage earlier.

497
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,502
A number of items from Ming
appear to be missing.

498
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:25,381
They're missing from the safe?
Who could have taken them?

499
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,715
Who else could it be?

500
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,302
[sighs wearily]

501
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,679
SABYEOKHEON

502
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:33,222
[trader] These are precious.

503
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,599
So please accept my apologies in advance,

504
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:39,395
as I can't offer this opportunity
to everyone.

505
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,105
[guest 1] How precious could it be?

506
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:44,400
Considering you want two pil of silk,
let's have a look at it.

507
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,026
I'll be the judge.

508
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,284
[all gasping]

509
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:55,619
[trader] As you're aware,

510
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:59,415
in Joseon, it's impossible to find
anything made of gold at the moment

511
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:05,045
since His Majesty had it prohibited
for being far too extravagant.

512
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:09,216
-[guest exhales]
-However...

513
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,845
this object was an offering
from a Ming envoy.

514
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:14,471
It could be yours.

515
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:18,559
-Isn't that exciting?
-[guest 2] Enough.

516
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,686
I will take it off your hands.

517
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:23,480
Yes.

518
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:27,776
Madam...

519
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,904
do you know Yu Rang of Qin?

520
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,074
He once spoke these immortal words.

521
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:39,246
"A meaningful man will lay down his life
for someone who sees who he is."

522
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:43,500
[chuckles]

523
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:45,210
"Whether it's men or things,"

524
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:49,006
"they won't shine until they're met
with someone who sees their value."

525
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:52,009
That said,

526
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,803
who here would like to meet that value?

527
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:05,189
[all exclaiming]

528
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,732
[guest 3] Oh, my goodness!

529
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,193
You look like a celestial maiden.

530
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,819
How beautiful.

531
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,447
They call it wagasa in Japan.

532
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,699
Look how beautiful it is.

533
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:17,034
Imagine you're out boating.

534
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,369
What better to give you shade
from the sun?

535
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,580
-Ten nyang!
-Five nyang more!

536
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,499
-Ten nyang more!
-Ten nyang more!

537
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,751
-[father] Lift it up! High!
-[trader grunts]

538
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,921
Little brat.

539
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:33,383
I told you to get married,
not steal and sell someone's property.

540
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,637
I did not steal, we're family.

541
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:39,807
-[sighs] And it was family property.
-Higher, you brat!

542
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,267
[sighs wearily]

543
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:44,561
I got five pil of silk for it.

544
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:45,646
What?

545
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,857
It was worth two pil.
My profit was more than double.

546
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:52,361
You... You're telling me
you made five pil?

547
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,445
[grunts]

548
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,697
Father... [pants]

549
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:59,118
You know I want to be a merchant.
[breathing heavily]

550
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:00,369
Right?

551
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,829
[panting]

552
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:02,913
Please, Father.

553
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,456
A girl cannot learn the trade.

554
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:08,377
It's hard. Being a merchant
is nothing like dealing with ladies.

555
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,837
You may not realize, Father...

556
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,756
[sighs] ladies can be as difficult
to sell to as men.

557
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,133
Ah, are you still at it?

558
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,803
I'll make my business silk
instead of salt and lumber.

559
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,429
Nice, pretty silk.

560
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:21,014
-[chuckles]
-Raise it.

561
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:23,809
Lift the pot!

562
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:26,854
[grunts]

563
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,316
[crickets chirping]

564
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,068
[â™ª Suspenseful music playing]

565
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,167
[door opens]

566
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:51,211
[announcer] Assistant Officer Lee is here.

567
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:14,943
[grunts]

568
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,286
Start upstream, Ilsam.

569
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:26,747
YONGSANJIN SEOGANGJIN

570
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,875
Ilsam of Seogang, my lord.
I hope everything has been going well.

571
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,211
Dochi of Yongsan. Pleasure, my lord.

572
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:34,922
YONGSANJIN

573
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:36,340
Deokgae of Mapo.

574
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,424
MAPOJIN

575
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:38,842
Here to pay respects.

576
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:43,347
Chadol of Dongho here.

577
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,390
DONGHOJIN

578
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:46,475
[sighs softly]

579
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:50,228
Jakdu of Nodeul. Allow me to bow.

580
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:51,730
NORYANGJIN

581
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:54,816
-[chuckles] Yes, yes.
-Gaebong of Hangang River.

582
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,693
HANGANGJIN

583
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:59,905
-[sighs softly]
-Greetings, Gangseop of Dongjak.

584
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,491
DONGJAKJIN

585
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,993
You're gathered here today
for two reasons.

586
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:08,705
First, I want you to crack down
on nomads entering the capital.

587
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,334
Drive them off
before they dock at the port.

588
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,378
I won't hold any of you accountable...

589
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,254
should someone die.

590
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,215
[all] Yes, my lord.

591
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,092
Inspection charge next.

592
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,010
Our coffers are empty.

593
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,638
The country's struggling financially.

594
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:28,266
However, exams are over
and new officials have been appointed.

595
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,518
We must celebrate.

596
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:33,063
So for the time being,
I'll double the inspection charge.

597
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,856
-[all gasping]
-Understood?

598
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,066
[Gaebong clears throat]

599
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,985
[all] Yes, understood.

600
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:39,987
-And Jakdu.
-Yes?

601
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:43,115
Your mother's 49th day since passing,
isn't it approaching?

602
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:45,242
Indeed, my lord.

603
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:48,161
I'll send saeu-jeot
and two quilted clothes.

604
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:51,581
-Just know that.
-You honor me deeply, my lord.

605
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:54,418
May you live long and prosper. [chuckles]

606
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,045
[chuckles] Right.

607
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:01,758
Stay focused
and tend to your duties. [grunts]

608
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:06,930
It's Dochi, sir.
May I say a word, my lord?

609
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:09,891
Let's hear it, then.

610
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:11,977
[exhales] Regarding Yanghwajin.

611
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,688
Smugglers who hail from outside

612
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:17,190
are starting to appear one by one
in our country.

613
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:19,985
I hear the court has been concerned
about it as well.

614
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:23,822
And the authorities,
they're not cracking down.

615
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,367
These rats roam about
with no consequences.

616
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:29,453
Fools like us... [chuckles]

617
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,329
We can't understand why that is.

618
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:32,414
And?

619
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:36,126
If you allow us, we can neatly
clean this entire mess.

620
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,836
-[scoffs]
-We need to beat a few

621
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:38,962
to set an example.

622
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:41,006
It will not only strengthen
your position...

623
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,090
Enough!

624
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:46,094
I ought to fry those eyes of yours.

625
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:50,891
That would be a fitting reward
for this good deed.

626
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:54,436
What made you think this was a good idea?

627
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,396
To lecture your elders?

628
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,818
No, my lord. I would never dare to...

629
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:03,779
You think you have something to teach me?

630
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,363
And I was so generous.

631
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:07,199
[gasping]

632
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:10,327
Well, then, what were you saying?

633
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,288
What do you wish to do?

634
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,416
-Huh?
-[Dochi's breath trembling]

635
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,335
My lord, I was only...

636
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,461
[exhales]

637
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,505
I beg your forgiveness!

638
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:24,800
You should just do as I say.
Who are you...

639
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:26,676
-to judge...
-My lord!

640
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,304
-[grunting]
-and decide anything?

641
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:32,349
Please spare me.

642
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,101
You just need to do as you're told!

643
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:35,852
I do the thinking!

644
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,105
Got that?

645
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:40,857
[exhales]

646
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:46,029
I'll say it again.

647
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:48,156
With everything in disarray,

648
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,242
I don't need your opinions.

649
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,286
Do as you're told and do it well.

650
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,831
-[Dochi grunting]
-My lord.

651
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,126
We dogs have been nothing but loyal.
[exhales] Show us mercy.

652
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:01,336
Then just carry out your duties.

653
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,967
[all grunting]

654
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,561
[growls] That fucking bastard!

655
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:20,647
-That ugly piece of shit lost his temper.
-I'm tired of this.

656
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,441
One of these days,
I'll stick a knife in his neck!

657
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:25,235
You'll see!

658
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,572
[â™ª Suspenseful music playing]

659
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:13,742
Hey, Jang's guild needs 12 men.

660
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,161
Good to see you, brother.

661
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,163
It's heavy cargo, all right?

662
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:21,124
So make sure to select the ones
with strong legs.

663
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:23,501
Hey, don't worry.
I'll take care of it, brother.

664
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,587
Who do you have here? It's Mudeok.

665
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,422
Mudeok? That's why we're worried!

666
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:29,758
He mouths off too much.

667
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,510
Fresh out of his mother's womb

668
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:34,346
yet he has no idea what respect is.

669
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,264
The selection begins now.

670
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:41,853
Twelve men to carry heavy cargo!

671
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:44,481
[workers clamoring]

672
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:51,029
-[worker] Get out of my way.
-[bandit] Get back in line.

673
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,199
-Count from the front.
-One.

674
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,283
-Two.
-Three.

675
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:56,368
-Four.
-Five.

-Six.
-Seven.

-Eight.
-Nine.

678
00:33:58,662 --> 00:33:59,663
-Ten.
-Eleven.

679
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,164
-Twelve.
-[bandit] Up to there.

680
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:02,290
Everybody else...

681
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,000
[workers clamoring]

682
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,758
Hey! Wait, wait, wait, wait.

683
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,553
What's this geezer doing here?

684
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:17,013
Get rid of him.

685
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:18,098
Hey, young man!

686
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:21,017
Yeah, you, the fresh one. Get over here.

687
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:22,894
[bandit 2] Hey, Beanpole, he means you.

688
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:24,604
Hey, wait!

689
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:27,399
How can you change the order?
It's my turn now.

690
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,693
Just take a look at how heavy
all that cargo is.

691
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,695
You're a mung beansprout.

692
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,280
-Too small and weak.
-Not fair.

693
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:35,282
I've been waiting here since dawn today.

694
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:37,784
Please let me work! Show me some mercy.

695
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,869
Aw, how diligent!

696
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:42,580
I haven't... I haven't eaten in two days.

697
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:46,293
I know I may look weak but I can do
the work of two or three.

698
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:48,628
So, please, please give me a chance.

699
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:50,755
Okay, sure. Hey, move it along.

700
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:52,799
[bandit] Hey, if you have your pass, move.

701
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:55,719
-No!
-Shut up, already!

Come on, what do you think you can do?

-Huh?

[agonized yells]

707
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:11,109
[Mudeok] We're done.

708
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:13,820
When the boss tells you no,
you need to listen.

709
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:16,615
-You like living, right?
-Please.

710
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:18,617
I beg you, let me work today.

711
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,286
-Otherwise my family will starve to death.
-[sighs]

712
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,788
Please, give me the pass.

713
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:27,083
-What are you waiting for?
-Move him out of here.

714
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,253
-Let's go.
-[worker] What are you doing?

715
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:31,671
[bandit] Get him back.

716
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,632
Hey, young man, you know me, don't you?

717
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:36,134
-Hey, hey, hey! Get him out of here.
-You know me.

718
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,345
-Tell them you won't...
-[bandit] Grab him.

719
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:40,347
I beg you, tell them!

720
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,932
Please! Please talk to them!

721
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:45,018
Please, please!

722
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,646
Young man! Young man!

723
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:49,606
-[bandit] Let's go for a swim.

724
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:51,858

[worker yells]

726
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,450
You don't want to work?

727
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,410
Should I give it to someone else?

728
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:08,416
[scoffs] Go on!

00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,290
Come over here.

739
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,386
What the...
You little shit, wait a minute.

[exhales]

741
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,813
When an elder calls you,
you should bow and say,

742
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,983
"Thank you for your generosity."

743
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:28,246
I'm waiting.

744
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,331
Well?

745
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:34,753
-Thank you for your generosity.
-That's right.

746
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,464
Haven't seen you around here.

747
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:47,140
Whoa, look at that body!

748
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:50,518
What are you? Are you a runaway soldier?

749
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:52,479
No, sir, I'm not.

750
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,023
Are you on the run from the law?

751
00:37:57,734 --> 00:37:59,068
Why are you asking me?

752
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:01,905
Well, you're not just some commoner.

753
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:04,908
Not when you've got sword scarring
like that.

754
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,075
Huh?

755
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:09,078
I got hurt while I was working.

756
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:10,955
I can tell you're lying.

757
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,749
Just by looking at the claws,

758
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:15,460
I can tell if it's a docile kitten
or a ferocious tiger.

759
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:23,176
I'd better get going.

760
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,220
To find more work.

761
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,224
Who said I was done talking?

00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:46,741
[â™ª Mysterious music playing]

763
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:54,290
I'm done.

764
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,835
Go on.

765
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,222
See you around!

766
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,936
-Hey, brother.
-Huh?

767
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,272
Who's that, a worker?

768
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,065
Was he causing trouble?

769
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,735
-Hey, Walwal.
-Yeah?

770
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:24,737
Find out where he lives.

771
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:26,948
-That man?
-Yeah.

772
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:31,619
[â™ª Dramatic pipe music playing]

773
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:42,130
-Yoon?
-Yes, boss?

774
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:43,715
What's the delay?

775
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:47,135
I'm guessing there's a lot to unload
because it's an envoy.

776
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:50,263
[indistinct chatter]

777
00:39:55,935 --> 00:40:00,732
Ah, this is quite the turnout.

00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,567
[Mudeok] Move your asses!

779
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,194
Hey, these things are to be offered
to the king.

780
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:06,988
Be careful!

781
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:12,076
Oh, come on! Would you hurry up?

782
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,621
Huh, if I see any of you slacking off,

783
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:18,333
I'm gonna break all of your legs and make
you crawl the rest of the way.

784
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,043
-Out of the way.
-Ow!

Get your priorities straight.

795
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,172
Hurry up and get the luggage out.

796
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,675
-Now!
-The luggage?

797
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:10,927
Is wealth...

798
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:14,889
[exhales] worth more than a man's life?

You bastard.

806
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,913
Keep your eyes down.

807
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,666
You want to be dragged
to the Police Bureau?

808
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,711
I apologize.

809
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,381
-Forgive me, sir.

You fool. [laughs]

812
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:56,139
Don't you ever glare like that.

813
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,141
-Yes, sir.
-Go and fetch it now.

814
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,518
[grunts] It's worth more than you.

815
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:02,645
Yes.

00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,232
[exhales, grunts]

817
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,529
[Bang] The King spoke.

818
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,614
The law's clear.

819
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:17,410
By unloading the minister's luggage,
you are working for the country

820
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,287
which means it's compulsory labor.

821
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:23,416
In other words,
that means there will be no pay.

822
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:26,544
-Keep that in mind.
-[worker] No pay?

823
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:29,964
Why do I hear murmuring while my brother's
out here talking?

824
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:32,675
Shut it! If you want to be selected, stay.

825
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:34,969
The rest of you leave. Scatter!

826
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:36,888
-Get out of here!
-Get moving!

827
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:40,099
[worker] If you're not paying us,
we should get fed.

828
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:43,853
We still get fed for compulsory labor.

829
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:46,606
-[Mudeok] Those bastards.
-[Bang] You there.

830
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:51,360
Come on up here. You're too far to hear.

831
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,572
It's the law. We all need to be fed.

832
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:08,211
What was that about the law?

833
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:12,048
[workers exclaiming]

834
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:15,009
-[Bang] Yeah, you heard him.
-[worker groans]

835
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:16,719
No matter if it's compulsory labor,

836
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:18,971
step right up if you're hungry.

837
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:20,765
-Here's something to eat!
-[groaning]

838
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,350
Huh?

839
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:26,020
-No one?
-[worker cries in agony]

840
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:27,897
Nobody wants to eat?

[worker grunts]

842
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:31,776
That's too bad for you.

[worker grunts in pain]

844
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:39,325
This man might die
if no one steps forward.

845
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:40,952
Well?

846
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,954
[worker 2] He's bleeding pretty bad.

847
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,044
Okay, this is your last chance, huh?

848
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:52,713
Huh?

849
00:43:58,344 --> 00:43:59,345
Hey, you.

850
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:01,931
Huh?

851
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,560
What's that look in your eye?

852
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:10,022
No matter where you go, there's always
one loach that dirties the water.

Wow, you got some muscles on you.

Oh!

You're the man, huh?

But I've changed my mind!

871
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:07,496
Huh?

[Assistant officer]
Look at you all having fun.

873
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,543
[Mudeok] Assistant Officer Lee!

874
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:14,462
[whimpers] What brings you here?

875
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,256
I don't care where you're from
or where you're going.

876
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:20,176
If I ever see you again, you're dead.

877

The lot of you are no better than rogues.

878
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:24,347
He's an innocent man.

879
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,515
You dare beat him in broad daylight?

880
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:29,727
[Mudeok] Hey, hey, all of you.
You're dismissed. Quickly.

881
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,229
Quickly. Take him away.

-Hurry! Scatter!
-[bandit] Come on!

883
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:37,401
Didn't I tell you not to cause any scenes
and just stay quiet?

884
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:40,321
-Did I or did I not, huh?
-[whimpers]

885
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,493
[groans in pain]

886
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:49,455
I'm no longer able to ignore
the amount of complaints I've received.

887
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:52,583
Your misconduct is well known.

888
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:58,297
Hey, hurry! Go fill up a mal with barley

889
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:00,800
and deliver it to his house.
[chuckles nervously]

890
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,468
[bandit] Okay.

891
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:05,263
[bandit 2] Right, fill it up all the way.

892
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:06,764
Keep going. Faster.

893
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:09,642
Do you know which bandit lives longest?

894
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:12,270
The one who can read my mind.

895
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:15,773
[sighs]

896
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:19,568
Oh, shit.

897
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:23,114
I still feel like I'm on pins and needles
every time I see his face.

898
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,825
[shudders]

899
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:29,745
I guess His Majesty is lucky that son of
a bitch is one of his officials.

900
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:31,580
Hey, hey!

901
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:32,790
Mix sand in with that.

902
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,709
Put two handfuls in there, huh?

903
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,585
When he eats, his teeth will fall out.

904
00:46:36,669 --> 00:46:38,587
Spit on it, all of us.

905
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:40,798
Now, where's the sand?

906
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:41,882
[grunts]

907
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,593
[worker sighs]

908
00:46:46,262 --> 00:46:48,639
Which one of you stole my rice, huh?

909
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:50,016
Was it you?

910
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:51,183
[worker 2] Sit down.

911
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:53,978
[sighs] Why do you always think
I did it, huh?

912
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:55,688
Show me your rice bag now!

913
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:58,649
Then what? You can tell whose rice it is?

914
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:01,610
-Shit! Show me, damn it!
-Wait!

915
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:03,279
-Hey!
-You son of a bitch!

916

918
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:12,121
-I told you...
-[others grunting]

919
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:14,665
[worker 2] No, no, no, no!

920

[all grunting]

921
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:19,337
[old worker] Sir, please, I beg you.

922
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:20,921
Let me work today.

923
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:23,716
Otherwise my family will starve to death.

924
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:28,512
Please, I beg of you.

925
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:33,225
I haven't... I haven't eaten in two days.

926
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:37,229
[â™ª Melancholy music playing]

927
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,211
Are you in here, old man?

928
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:06,258
Hello?

929
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:33,160
[sighs]

930
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,372
[â™ª Melancholy music continues playing]

931
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:02,523
[forester 1] Hurry up! A man is dead!

932
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,567
[forester 2] This way! Over here!

933
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,319
[forester 1] Hurry! [shouts indistinctly]

934
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:10,030
[foresters clamoring]

935
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,495
[forester 3] What's happened? He's dead.

936
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:18,289
He's dead!

937
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:21,667
[foresters wailing]

938
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:24,086
[forester 3] How could this happen?

939
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:26,255
[sobbing and wailing]

940
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:28,507
[â™ª Melancholy music playing]

941
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:49,487
[forester] Don't fall.

942
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:52,072
Careful up there!

943
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:54,116
-[forester 4] Get down.
-[grunts]

944

[forester sobbing]

945
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:01,165

[tourist laughing]

951
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,749
What a pleasant day to go boating.
The water was very calm.

952
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:45,543
[tourist 2] It was, wasn't it?

953
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:46,710
[laughter]

954
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:49,129
[tourists exclaiming, laughing]

955
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:51,465
[tourist 3] I spent so much money
on this dress.

956
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:53,717
[grunts]

957
00:50:56,971 --> 00:50:58,264
[â™ª Mysterious music playing]

958
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:26,834
How dare you taint this
with your filthy hands?

959
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,673
We should go.

960
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:54,612
[laughs] Don't you think so?

961
00:51:55,738 --> 00:51:57,197
Sure.

962
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:00,117
[worker grunts]

963
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,411
[sighs] Oh, boy.

964
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:06,790
We've finished unloading.

965
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:08,626
Good. Well done.

966
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:11,045
You can all go home now. Go on.

967
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,797
What? Wait a minute. Where's our pay?

968
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:16,091
Look at them there. You see over there?

969
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:20,304
They're not from just any noble families.

970
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:22,014
That's the Scholar-official's wife

971
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:24,642
and Second State Councilor's
daughter-in-law.

972
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:26,935
How can we go and ask them for the wage?

973
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:29,980
No pay for compulsory labor yesterday.

974
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:33,901
Now we can't get paid
because they're from noble families.

975
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:36,987
How are we to make a living?

976
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:38,656
[grunts] I'll tell you how.

977
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:40,240
Have you lost your mind?

978
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:42,451
Why are you glaring like that?

979
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:43,827
Go, get lost.

980
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:45,162
[groans in pain]

981
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:48,832
[sighs] I can't starve anymore.
Just pay us.

982
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:51,210
Damn you!

983
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:54,254
[groans]

984
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:55,589
What are you, a cow?

985
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:59,093
Did everything I say bounce off
that thick skull of yours?

986
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,970
They didn't pay me either so why
are you whining at me?

987
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:04,181
Go! Get paid, then.

988
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,767
What's going on with all of you?

989
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,770
I keep seeing you idiots talking back
more and more these days.

990
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:12,981
I'll seriously brand you as traitors
if you don't watch your step.

991
00:53:13,774 --> 00:53:14,775
Do you hear me?

992
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:17,569
Answer me.

993
00:53:18,487 --> 00:53:19,905
Answer me!

994
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:21,907
[workers, disconsolately] Yes.

995
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:24,284
[Walwal] Return the passes and go now.

996
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:28,789
You'd better keep your mouth shut.
Leave now. Scatter!

997
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:31,291
Sons of bitches.

998
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,130
Fine.

999
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:39,091
But if I find out you've been lying to me,

1000
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:42,428
I'll kill you myself.

1001
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:45,305
What?

1002
00:53:46,098 --> 00:53:47,266
[stammers] You...

1003
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:49,309
[â™ª affirmative music playing]

1004
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:53,355
Wait, where are you going?

1005
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:06,535
[panting]

1006
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:10,205
[indistinct chatter]

1007
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:20,466
-[grunts]
-[pants]

1008
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,555
That was awfully rude of you.

1009
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:30,809
Are you the lady
I saw earlier at the port?

1010
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:34,021
-You went boating.
-And?

1011
00:54:35,898 --> 00:54:37,274
[panting]

1012
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:39,193
Who paid today for the boat ride?

1013
00:54:39,902 --> 00:54:41,111
Was it one of you?

1014
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,739
I was the one who paid.

1015
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:46,158
[inhales sharply]

1016
00:54:48,035 --> 00:54:49,745
Please pay us.

1017
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:51,872
You owe us our wages.

1018
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:54,249
Wages? What do you mean?

1019
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,878
You got our labor so
someone has to pay for the work,

1020
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,796
no matter how noble your family is.

1021
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,591
No one should work for free.

1022
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:07,429
That's not it, my lady.
We paid for everything up front.

1023
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:11,266
As far as I was told, we paid for
both the boat and the laborers.

1024
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:13,936
You heard her.

1025
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,148
You're blocking the road?

1026
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:22,069
They told me that they weren't paid.

1027
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,821
You really think a Choi's guild noblewoman
would lie

1028
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:26,198
just to save so little?

1029
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:28,575
I'm sorry.

1030
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:31,662
But no one received any pay.

1031
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,997
Let us pass or you'll regret it.

1032
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:41,171
[Bang] Look what we have here.

1033
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:44,132
[chuckles] Now you're really out of line.

1034
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:46,426
[sighs]

1035
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,976
[gasps] My lady!

1036
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:58,689
Tell the lady you're sorry. Go on.

1037
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,068
No apology?

1038
00:56:03,986 --> 00:56:05,862
I haven't eaten in three days.

1039
00:56:05,946 --> 00:56:08,907
Brother, let's knock some sense
into him already.

1040
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:13,412
I don't know what's going on.

1041
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:18,250
All I know is, I wasn't paid for the work.

1042
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:20,836
You haven't learned.

1043
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,590
Nothing a good beating won't fix.

1044
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:34,433
My lady, you should go.

1045
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,393
Leave this fool to me.

1046
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:42,190
-Be on your way.
-All right.

1047
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:44,318
We should go.

1048
00:56:46,028 --> 00:56:47,362
Unless...

1049
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:51,742
you'd like to witness
the death of this dog.

1050
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,002
Don't just stand there.

1051
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,545
Surround him.

1052
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:27,361
[chuckles]

1053
00:57:29,905 --> 00:57:31,698
Now that we ate,

1054
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,910
let's work off a little sweat.

1055
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:39,748
Know that I'm not a kind person.

1056
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:41,708
That just makes it better.

1057
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:43,752
We don't put up with rebels.

1058
00:57:45,212 --> 00:57:48,006
-All this for a doe of rice?
-Look at those eyes.

1059
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:50,592
Oh, my, oh, my.

1060
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:53,011
You bastard.
