Sorry to say, boss, Mudeok is quite short.

Oh, hey, don't tell me you're also
gonna weigh in on this.

148

You better offer up your clothes...
to make up for the missing tax.

That's the rule, no?

150

to get on my nerves.

353
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,764
[sighs] Now what's wrong?

354
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,307
This isn't the correct order.

355
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,017
The salt should be unloaded first.

356
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:43,062
[sighs in exasperation]
I just do whatever I'm told to do.

357
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,940
When it comes to the order,
I have no say in that.

358
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,817
I docked my boat half a day ago.

359
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,070
How can you ignore that
and unload the rice before the salt?

360
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,240
[groans] Look, it's not me
that makes the decision, huh?

361
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,158
-[sighs]
-If you've got a problem,

362
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,369
go find the higher-ups
and ask them what to do.

363
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,453
Good grief.

364
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,414
[grunts]

365
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,500
That bastard, he's still showing
his face around here.

366
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,335
Shit.

367
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,087
Hey! You!

368
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,463
[panting] Damn it.

369
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,507
-Here! [grunts]
-[worker grunts]

370
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:14,802
Hey, what did I tell you, huh?

371
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,596
You can't work here anymore.

372
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:17,888
Please allow me to work.

373
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:20,099
I will never complain
about the wage again.

374
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,191
-[chuckling] Wait, are you crazy?
-[bandit sighs]

375
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,235
Yoon, we have to talk.

376
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:34,488
We docked three days ago,
I was pushed back again.

377
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,282
That's supposed to mean something?

378
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,658
Clouds are forming.

379
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:40,328
And? Stay patient and wait your turn.

380
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,997
If it starts to pour,
I could lose over half the salt.

381
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,416
-[Yoon] Shut up, you idiot.
-[all laughing]

382
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,753
Look here, young man. [sighs]

383
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,796
Mapo has always had certain customs.

384
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,132
We know
it's always been first in, first out.

385
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,092
Hey, look. Listen.

386
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:57,011
[bandit grunting]

387
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,513
It's not like
I'm the one who makes the law.

388
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:02,308
[bandits all laughing]

389
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,935
We are not passing any laws. Right, boys?

390
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,313
[laughter continues]

391
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,315
I want to talk to your boss, then.

392
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:13,194
[Yoon] The esteemed Chief Kang
is gonna head up.

393
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,196
[bandit] One more shot. [laughing]

394
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:27,875
Lord Deokgae.

395
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,421
[scoffs] What do you mean by "lord"?

396
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,382
The real lord will be disappointed.

397
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,050
Hmm.

398
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,970
Would you move up my turn in line?

399
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:42,348
I'm carrying salt,
I'll be in trouble if it rains.

400
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,308
When rain's involved...

401
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,727
everyone's in a hurry.

402
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:47,812
Are they not?

403
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:49,939
[laughs]

404
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,732
[man sighs]

405
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,944
Now that's a despicable tactic.

406
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,117
That covers the rush charge.

407
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:03,119
Can you please hurry?

408
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,788
Yoon, you hear that?

409
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,039
I hear you, Boss.

410
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:09,083
Chief Kang should be rushed ahead.

411
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,169
Got a rush order in for Choi's guild!

412
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:13,337
Much appreciated.

413
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,172
You take care now.

414
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,431
So you shift the order
and they pay a charge.

415
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,225
A rain charge for the rain.

416
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,936
A flood charge if there's a flood.

417
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,939
[scoffs] And the commoners'
blood and sweat,

418
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,316
you make sure to squeeze them dry.

419
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,026
Let's compare, then.

420
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,155
That's nothing.

421
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,574
A drop of piss in the Gyeonggang River.

422
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,325
An inspection charge for inspecting.

423
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,786
A training charge for training.

424
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:49,874
A charge for new assignments
and another charge for leaving.

425
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,126
[chuckles]

426
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:55,671
The amount
that we're squeezed by our lords,

427
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,632
we don't have a drop of sweat left either.

428
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:00,342
[laughs]

429
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,720
Not a drop, huh?

430
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,681
-[both laughing]
-Not a drop left, you say.

431
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,767
-Not a drop.
-[both laughing]

432
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,897
[grunts]

433
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,523
[♪ Ominous music playing]

434
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,988
[breath trembles]

435
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,491
I could tear you apart right now.

436
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:26,577
I show a bit of mercy
and he walks all over me.

437
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,870
Is that it?

438
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,414
No, I would never. My lord, I wasn't...

439
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:32,875
Then why do you speak when I'm speaking?

440
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,044
Come here.

441
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,799
Closer.

442
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,343
[grunts]

443
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,514
If you do not watch your tongue...

444
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:49,975
-[trembling]
-you could die.

445
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:52,311
Without a doubt, my lord.

446
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,479
[breath trembling]

447
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,567
[bowl thuds]

448
00:21:58,651 --> 00:21:59,652
[sighs]

449
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,532
[rice wine trickling]

450
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:09,537
Drink it.

451
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:13,624
Oh.

452
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,751
All right, yes, thank you.

453
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,420
[gulping]

454
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:22,842
[laughing]

455
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:25,052
[retching]

456
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:31,684
[coughs]

457
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,728
[laughing] What a fool. I was just joking.

458
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:38,566
You were so scared.

459
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:40,234
[continues laughing]

460
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,528
-Hey! Pour me a glass.
-Yes.

461
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:43,863
Of course, my lord. Yes.

462
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,906
[both laughing]

463
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:46,991
[crickets chirping]

464
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:53,163
Good evening, sir. Allow me to enter.

465
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,385
We finished. Everything's been unloaded.

466
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,138
You paid a rush charge, I heard.

467
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:10,806
I had to pay.

468
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,560
[scoffs] On top of everything else,
a rush charge.

469
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,061
Those thieving bastards.

470
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:18,105
-Father.
-[sighs]

471
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,066
The bandits are only petty thieves.

472
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,777
They're just someone else's tools.

473
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:27,573
The real issue is the officials
who sit around milking the rewards

474
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,491
of their corruption from the shadows.

475
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:30,659
[sighs]

476
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:32,786
What's this nonsense?
Have you been drinking?

477
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,872
We know the bandits
are reporting to someone.

478
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,081
[man] Silence, you fool.

479
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:37,666
You should know when to stop.

480
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,627
[sighs] We're only merchants.

481
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:43,923
Words like those will bring us trouble,
so we ought to be careful.

482
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,215
[sighs] That's why...

483
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,676
That's why I need to become an official.

484
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,888
You can't be an official
if you don't even pass the exam.

485
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,641
You've been saying
you'd pass for 10 years now.

486
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:56,268
-[sighs]
-It's time you learned the trade.

487
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:58,395
[inhales sharply]

488
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:01,607
That life isn't for me.

489
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,691
[inhales]

490
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,443
If one is born as a man,

491
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:07,363
it's his duty to rise to office
in order to rule the world.

492
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:09,198
Wouldn't you agree?

493
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:11,492
[sighs]

494
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:15,204
My one and only son, a rainbow chaser.

495
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:16,830
There's more, sir.

496
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:18,916
I checked the storage earlier.

497
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,502
A number of items from Ming
appear to be missing.

498
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:25,381
They're missing from the safe?
Who could have taken them?

499
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,715
Who else could it be?

500
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,302
[sighs wearily]

501
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,679
SABYEOKHEON

502
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:33,222
[trader] These are precious.

503
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,599
So please accept my apologies in advance,

504
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:39,395
as I can't offer this opportunity
to everyone.

505
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,105
[guest 1] How precious could it be?

506
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:44,400
Considering you want two pil of silk,
let's have a look at it.

507
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,026
I'll be the judge.

508
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,284
[all gasping]

509
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:55,619
[trader] As you're aware,

510
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:59,415
in Joseon, it's impossible to find
anything made of gold at the moment

511
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:05,045
since His Majesty had it prohibited
for being far too extravagant.

512
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:09,216
-[guest exhales]
-However...

513
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,845
this object was an offering
from a Ming envoy.

514
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:14,471
It could be yours.

515
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:18,559
-Isn't that exciting?
-[guest 2] Enough.

516
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,686
I will take it off your hands.

517
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:23,480
Yes.

518
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:27,776
Madam...

519
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,904
do you know Yu Rang of Qin?

520
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,074
He once spoke these immortal words.

521
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:39,246
"A meaningful man will lay down his life
for someone who sees who he is."

522
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:43,500
[chuckles]

523
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:45,210
"Whether it's men or things,"

524
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:49,006
"they won't shine until they're met
with someone who sees their value."

525
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:52,009
That said,

526
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,803
who here would like to meet that value?

527
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:05,189
[all exclaiming]

528
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,732
[guest 3] Oh, my goodness!

529
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,193
You look like a celestial maiden.

530
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,819
How beautiful.

531
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,447
They call it wagasa in Japan.

532
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,699
Look how beautiful it is.

533
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:17,034
Imagine you're out boating.

534
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,369
What better to give you shade
from the sun?

535
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,580
-Ten nyang!
-Five nyang more!

536
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,499
-Ten nyang more!
-Ten nyang more!

537
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,751
-[father] Lift it up! High!
-[trader grunts]

538
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,921
Little brat.

539
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:33,383
I told you to get married,
not steal and sell someone's property.

540
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,637
I did not steal, we're family.

541
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:39,807
-[sighs] And it was family property.
-Higher, you brat!

542
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,267
[sighs wearily]

543
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:44,561
I got five pil of silk for it.

544
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:45,646
What?

545
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,857
It was worth two pil.
My profit was more than double.

546
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:52,361
You... You're telling me
you made five pil?

547
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,445
[grunts]

548
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,697
Father... [pants]

549
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:59,118
You know I want to be a merchant.
[breathing heavily]

550
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:00,369
Right?

551
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,829
[panting]

552
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:02,913
Please, Father.

553
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,456
A girl cannot learn the trade.

554
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:08,377
It's hard. Being a merchant
is nothing like dealing with ladies.

555
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,837
You may not realize, Father...

556
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,756
[sighs] ladies can be as difficult
to sell to as men.

557
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,133
Ah, are you still at it?

558
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,803
I'll make my business silk
instead of salt and lumber.

559
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,429
Nice, pretty silk.

560
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:21,014
-[chuckles]
-Raise it.

561
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:23,809
Lift the pot!

Ilsam of Seogang, my lord.
I hope everything has been going well.

571
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,211
Dochi of Yongsan. Pleasure, my lord.

Here to pay respects.

DONGJAKJIN

585
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,993
You're gathered here today
for two reasons.

586
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:08,705
First, I want you to crack down
on nomads entering the capital.

587
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,334
Drive them off
before they dock at the port.

588
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,378
I won't hold any of you accountable...

589
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,254
should someone die.

590
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,215
[all] Yes, my lord.

591
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,092
Inspection charge next.

592
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,010
Our coffers are empty.

593
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,638
The country's struggling financially.

594
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:28,266
However, exams are over
and new officials have been appointed.

595
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,518
We must celebrate.

596
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:33,063
So for the time being,
I'll double the inspection charge.

597
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,856
-[all gasping]
-Understood?

598
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,066
[Gaebong clears throat]

599
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,985
[all] Yes, understood.

600
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:39,987
-And Jakdu.
-Yes?

601
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:43,115
Your mother's 49th day since passing,
isn't it approaching?

602
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:45,242
Indeed, my lord.

603
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:48,161
I'll send saeu-jeot
and two quilted clothes.

604
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:51,581
-Just know that.
-You honor me deeply, my lord.

605
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:54,418
May you live long and prosper. [chuckles]

606
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,045
[chuckles] Right.

607
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:01,758
Stay focused
and tend to your duties. [grunts]

608
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:06,930
It's Dochi, sir.
May I say a word, my lord?

609
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:09,891
Let's hear it, then.

610
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:11,977
[exhales] Regarding Yanghwajin.

611
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,688
Smugglers who hail from outside

612
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:17,190
are starting to appear one by one
in our country.

613
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:19,985
I hear the court has been concerned
about it as well.

614
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:23,822
And the authorities,
they're not cracking down.

615
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,367
These rats roam about
with no consequences.

616
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:29,453
Fools like us... [chuckles]

617
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,329
We can't understand why that is.

618
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:32,414
And?

619
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:36,126
If you allow us, we can neatly
clean this entire mess.

620
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,836
-[scoffs]
-We need to beat a few

621
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:38,962
to set an example.

622
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:41,006
It will not only strengthen
your position...

623
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,090
Enough!

624
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:46,094
I ought to fry those eyes of yours.

625
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:50,891
That would be a fitting reward
for this good deed.

626
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:54,436
What made you think this was a good idea?

627
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,396
To lecture your elders?

628
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,818
No, my lord. I would never dare to...

629
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:03,779
You think you have something to teach me?

630
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,363
And I was so generous.

632
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:10,327
Well, then, what were you saying?

633
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,288
What do you wish to do?

634
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,416
-Huh?
-[Dochi's breath trembling]

635
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,335

[exhales]

637
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,505
I beg your forgiveness!

638
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:24,800
You should just do as I say.
Who are you...

-to judge...
-My lord!

640
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,304

-and decide anything?

Please spare me.

642
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,101
You just need to do as you're told!

643
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:35,852
I do the thinking!

644
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,105
Got that?

With everything in disarray,

648
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,242
I don't need your opinions.

649
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,286
Do as you're told and do it well.

-My lord.

We dogs have been nothing but loyal.

00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:01,336

When the boss tells you no,
you need to listen.

-You like living, right?
-Please.

710
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:18,617

Should I give it to someone else?

you should bow and say,

"Thank you for your generosity."

743
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:28,246

Whoa, look at that body!

What are you? Are you a runaway soldier?

00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:52,479
No, sir, I'm not.

750
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,023
Are you on the run from the law?

751
00:37:57,734 --> 00:37:59,068
Why are you asking me?

752
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:01,905
Well, you're not just some commoner.

753
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:04,908
Not when you've got sword scarring
like that.

754
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,075
Huh?

755
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:09,078
I got hurt while I was working.

756
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:10,955
I can tell you're lying.

757
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,749
Just by looking at the claws,

758
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:15,460
I can tell if it's a docile kitten
or a ferocious tiger.

759
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:23,176
I'd better get going.

760
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,220
To find more work.

Who's that, a worker?

Was he causing trouble?

What's the delay?

775
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:47,135
I'm guessing there's a lot to unload
because it's an envoy.

By unloading the minister's luggage,
you are working for the country
