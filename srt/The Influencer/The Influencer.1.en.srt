who has the biggest influence?

23
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:05,131
Out of the 77 influencers,

24
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:07,067

will be the last one standing?

25

[chiming]

29
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,418
[light suspenseful music]

30
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:33,693
[influencer 1] Ooh.

31
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:35,662
[exclaims]

32
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:40,433
Whoa.

33
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:42,368
Ooh.

34
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,638
What does "M85.5" mean?

35
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:48,708
[influencer 1 exclaims, chuckles]

36
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:50,410
Whoa.

37
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:52,245
Hold on, what is this?

38
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,149
I never imagined
it would be this impressive.

39
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:59,519
[upbeat music]

40
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:07,160
Oh, wow.

41
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,130
Oh, wow.

42
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:13,900
[influencer 1] Hello, I'm Changhyun.

43
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,503
I run a YouTube channel
called StreetKaraoke.

44
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:24,210
[upbeat music]

45
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:27,647
[Changhyun] I've been in AfreecaTV BJ
for a pretty long time.

46
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,782
And now, I'm also doing YouTube as well.

47
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,720
Hello. Nice to meet you.
Welcome to Changhyun's StreetKaraoke.

48
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:37,223
Let's see who will become the winner
of the 200-million-won prize?

49
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,193
[Changhyun] I've been in this field
for about nine or ten years.

50
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,229
I'm probably a dinosaur
to the other YouTubers here.

51
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,031
I've been doing this for a long time.

52
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:47,734
So, I hope to survive here
as long as possible.

53
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:49,636
- [door opens]
- [influencer 2] Oh.

54
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,272
[door closes]

55
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,008
Ooh. [puffs]

56
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,745
[upbeat music]

57
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:04,417
Ooh.

58
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:06,486
Who's that?

59
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,390
[Changhyun] Man, you dressed so cool.

60
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:12,959
And I'm just wearing
a stretched out T-shirt.

61
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:15,495
[influencer 2] I'm Sanghyuk.

62
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:19,165
My five-year-old mukbang channel
has 1.23 million followers.

63
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,701
I "slay" at mukbang content,

64
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,203
as Gen-Z would say.

65
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,371
Mmm.

66
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:26,739
[slurps]

67
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:31,844
[slurps] Mmm.

68
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:34,480
[Sanghyuk]
I thought there would be creators here

69
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,216
with channels similar to mine.

70
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,518
Changhyun nim's channel
is bigger than mine.

71
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,486
So I'd be surprised if he wasn't here.

72
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:41,921
Sanghyuk nim.

73
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:43,022
- Hello.
- How are you?

74
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,691
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

75
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,227
[bold music]

76
00:03:58,771 --> 00:03:59,906
[influencer 3] I'm Mejiwoo.

77
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,875
A brand director
and I manage various brands

78
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:06,346
while also operating YouTube channels
and Instagram profiles.

79
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:09,282
Let's see…

80
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:12,852
I have, I think,
around 11 million followers on Instagram.

81
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,420
11.02M FOLLOWERS

82
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:17,123
Even so, I think there are
more people who don't know me

83
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,691
than people who do.

84
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,728
[Mejiwoo] And I'm excited to create
new networks while I'm here.

85
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:25,198
[both chuckle]

86
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,333
- She's avoiding us.
- [Changhyun] Right?

87
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,568
Should we sit together?

88
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:31,070
- [Sanghyuk] You don't…You don't have to.
- I don't? Okay.

89
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:33,940
- [influencer 4] Wow.
- Who the heck is this?

90
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,743
- Looks like the place. Hello, everyone.
- [upbeat music]

91
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:37,910
Woo-hoo.

92
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:39,545
Wow.

93
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,514
[upbeat music continues]

94
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:45,184
Hey, where is-- I must be early, right?

95
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,820
- Yeah.
- [Changhyun] Wow.

96
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,590
- [Changhyun] Wow.
- [influencer 4] Wow.

97
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,325
Oh, my… Wow.

98
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,962
Hi, I'm this era's rising digital clown,

99
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,264
Qrrr-QYOUNG!

100
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,932
[Changhyun chuckles]

101
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:04,537
Where to sit? Hello, nice to meet you all.

102
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:07,240
If you fall for me, there's no way out.

103
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,043
I'm Qrrr-QYOUNG. [whoops]

104
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,412
QYOUNG
BEAUTY AND FASHION YOUTUBER

105
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:16,082
[QYOUNG] I'm not only an influencer,
but also a creator.

106
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,385
Because I make creative content
related to beauty and fashion.

107
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:23,189
So I instill and influence
aesthetic values in people.

108
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:26,125
You know how "Underboob"
was once a huge thing in fashion?

109
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:27,794
Now "Underballs" is a new trend.

110
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,496
"Underballs", yeah. Under-ball.

111
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,765
It's cool. I feel the breeze.

112
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:36,502
[QYOUNG] I'm ready to have some real fun.

113
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:38,171
Let's play, QYOUNG!

114
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,573
Are you going to be okay in that outfit?

115
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,008
- [QYOUNG] Of course.
- Okay.

116
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:45,044
- Want to touch it?
- Oh, no, no, no.

117
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,112
- I'm good, I'm good.
- [QYOUNG] Go ahead.

118
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,380
Oh, sure.

119
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,649
- [QYOUNG] Cool, right?
- [Changhyun] Oh, yeah. It's really cool.

120
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:52,952
I made it myself. I made it myself.

121
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,921
Oh, looks like we have
the same dress code today.

122
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:56,723
- No, I don't think so.
- [QYOUNG] Green. Green, right?

123
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:58,691
- [Sanghyuk] You look awesome.
- Nice to meet you.

124
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:01,194
- [influencer 5] Anybody here?
- [knocking on door]

125
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:04,630
Huh?

126
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,599
Battle Royale?

127
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:10,670
[relaxing music]

128
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,774
What?

129
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:17,210
"1.97M"?

130
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:18,945
Whatever.

131
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:22,014
I'm PaniBottle, a travel YouTuber.

132
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:24,817
[PaniBottle]
Well, my main platform is YouTube.

133
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:28,721
I've recently been on TV shows
here and there as well.

134
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:31,023
I bet there will be a lot of people.

135
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,326
I'm excited to see
what's waiting for all of us.

136
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:36,396
- Hello. Hello.
- [exciting music]

137
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:37,764
- [PaniBottle] Hello.
- Wow.

138
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,865
[PaniBottle] Hello.

139
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:41,934
What? Wait, my favorite guy is here.

140
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,302
I love PaniBottle.

141
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:44,270
PaniBottle nim!

142
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,806
I've been really wanting
to meet him in person.

143
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,108
Who might win? Maybe PaniBottle?

144
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,411
When PaniBottle nim walked in,

145
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:54,247
there was a sense of victory
following him.

146
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:56,616
- [QYOUNG] Who's that?
- [PaniBottle] Hello, how are you?

147
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,019
[exclaims, laughs]

148
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,324
- [QYOUNG] Nice meeting you.
- Is that your everyday outfit?

149
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,593
- Yeah, it is.
- Yeah, I wasn't ready for that.

150
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,429
[chuckles] Interesting start.

151
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,698
Do you know what this is?

152
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,734
[Sanghyuk] Oh, I, uh,
think these are to show

153
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:17,603
our subscribing numbers,
size of our channels, stuffs like that.

154
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:22,175
- Oh, you're right. "M" is for million.
- [QYOUNG] Oh, the number of followers.

155
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:26,479
[PaniBottle] That's when I thought,
"This isn't a fair game from the start."

156
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,347
"If we were to do something
with these numbers,

157
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:31,184
then it wouldn't be
a bad starting point for me."

158
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,719
[Sanghyuk]
The number I have isn't so terrible.

159
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,956
I feel like
we are in a hierarchical society.

160
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,694
This place is cruel.
Our class is divided by numbers.

161
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,096
Here we go.

162
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:45,298
Hello.

163
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:48,234
[QYOUNG] Welcome, Han A-reum-song-e.
Nice to see you.

164
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,169
- Come here.
- [A-reum-song-e] Hey, everyone.

165
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:52,538
- [QYOUNG] Come here. You look great.
- [Changhyun] Is she an elf?

166
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,807
Pose for all of us.
Pose like an elf.

167
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:56,943
[PaniBottle] Dang, that's how to make
your first appearance.

168
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:59,078
- [QYOUNG] Yes, Mama, you're doing great.
- I know.

169
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,613
- Look at those hands.
- [exclaims]

170
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,014
[PaniBottle] What the hands?

171
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:03,616
- [Pure.D] I think maybe this was too much.
- [QYOUNG] They looked real.

172
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:04,517
[Pure.D] What?

173
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,219
- [QYOUNG] You're doing this.
- No, but what are these?

174
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:09,555
- You're totally outshining me. Seriously.
- Look who's talking. Girl, chill.

175
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:11,491
- [QYOUNG] Look who's talking. Girl, chill.
- [Pure.D] Seriously.

176
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:14,927
- I'm already tired.
- [QYOUNG] Oh, girl.

177
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,295
[Pure.D] Somebody else is here.

178
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,733
[traditional Oriental music]

179
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,934
What the heck?

180
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:25,638
Welcome. I've been waiting for you.
I've waited for you.

181
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,340
[Changhyun] Is he a TikToker?

182
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:30,076
[PaniBottle] His name is Needmorecash.
He's a Shorts creator.

183
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:31,210
[QYOUNG] Welcome.

184
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:33,379
[Pure.D] I'm being drained.
I need to stay over here.

185
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:34,814
I knew he was going to show.

186
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,549
Wow, look at his pecks.

187
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:37,583
[Pure.D] This is crazy.

188
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:40,520
- [eagle squawks effect]
- [Pure.D] Wow.

189
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:41,587
[Changhyun] Is he a bot?

190
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:43,256
That's an influencer.

191
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,358
My name is Needmorecash

192
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:47,093
and I'm bringing joy to people

193
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,594
through short-form videos.

194
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:51,464
One of the main
and most popular characters I play

195
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,033
in the videos I make
is a man in a blue suit.

196
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,003
And that's how I am going
to appear in the show.

197
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,405
The problem…

198
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,774
- is the character doesn't talk.
- [comical music]

199
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:04,577
[Needmorecash] Since I have no idea
what we're going to do anyway,

200
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:06,245
I'll just stick to my concept.

201
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,649
- He looks cool.
- Hello.

202
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:10,683
How are you?

203
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,784
[QYOUNG] Would you like champagne?

204
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:13,653
[Pure.D]
Is that what he's going to do all day?

205
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,788
[QYOUNG] I'm curious
how long he'll be able to keep that up.

206
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:16,989
[Changhyun chuckles] Please, right?

207
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,724
He doesn't talk?

208
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,960
[Changhyun] I see.
Oh, yes. Nice to meet you.

209
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:22,528
[PaniBottle]
He doesn't talk but he's wearing a mic?

210
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:23,963
[PaniBottle laughs]

211
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,032
[indistinct chatter and laughter]

212
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:27,867
[influencer 6] What is this?

213
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:29,902
We're starting now?

214
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:33,539
This is kind of scary.

215
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,242
It's not gonna be light and fun?

216
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:37,910
No, what is this?

217
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,345
It's kind of cool though.

218
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:41,581
Mom, I'm on TV.

219
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:43,983
[influencer 6] Hello, Netflix.

220
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,618
My name is Ji-sou Jang.

221
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:48,521
And I'm here
in the program The Influencer.

222
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,157
Subscribe. [laughs]

223
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,526
[Ji-sou] I was Quaddurup,
but now I'm Jang Ji-sou,

224
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,595
a YouTuber with 1.2 million followers.

225
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,296
- [trainer] What was that?
- Apologies, sir.

226
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,365
- [trainer] Attitude problem?
- No, sir!

227
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,635
[Ji-sou] Survival programs cast me

228
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:05,905
because other influencers
are afraid of receiving a lot of hate

229
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:07,306
once the show's air.

230
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,475
But I'm not the kind of person
who worries about that.

231
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:10,643
One of my strengths

232
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,913
is that I know many content creators
and influencers already.

233
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,981
I make a promise.

234
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:17,717
If I don't know any content creator
on The Influencer,

235
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,285
I'll quit YouTube.

236
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:23,255
[influencers cheering]

237
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:24,924
[Ji-sou] I bet some people will say,

238
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,192
"It's Quaddurup."

239
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:27,593
- It's Quaddurup.
- [male influencer] Oh, what?

240
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,861
I bet some will say,

241
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:30,396
- "Hi!"
- Hi!

242
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,497
- Hi, Ji-sou.
- Hello.

243
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,132
[QYOUNG] Hip-hop boy.

244
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,668
I think everyone here knows Ji-sou.

245
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,470
I know lots of people.

246
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:40,640
[Ji-sou] Ji-sou Jang, let's freaking go!

247
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:42,141
[Ji-sou] Cheong-il ssi.

248
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,181
Did you scan this? The NFC?

249
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:50,416
No. What's that?

250
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,884
Tag this code with your phone.

251
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,686
But the video is not available yet.

252
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:55,321
[female influencer]
Oh, it's not available yet?

253
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,356
- [male influencer] Did it work?
- [suspenseful music]

254
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,091
- What?
- What was that?

255
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,760
- Did it work?
- Oh, wow.

256
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,728
- Did you scan your phone here?
- [female influencer] What?

257
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,730
Look how smart he is?
I'm not good at these things.

PARK SEO-A

259
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:09,035
[PaniBottle] Ji-sou has made
survival games all by himself before.

260
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:12,405
He looks for stuff like this
to see if he can figure things out.

261
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:14,940
[Seo-a] What if he wins?
I'm jealous already.

262
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,009

263
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,879

Oh, I literally watched her,

266
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,454
her stretching video earlier this morning.

267
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:32,658
[QYOUNG] Welcome, Shim Eu-ddeum. Wow!

268
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,026

00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:40,099
That ass.

272
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,101
Is she the Korean cosplay champion?

[exclaims]

274
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:45,471
She's the number one cosplayer.

275
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,772
Yeah, I know.

276
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,908

[influencers exclaiming, cheering]

279
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:57,516
I knew he'd come. I knew it.

280
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,651
He had to be here.

281
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,719
Hi!

282
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:00,753
- What?
- [QYOUNG] Welcome!

283
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,188
You're here?

284
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:03,756

a multi-genre content creator.

295
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:22,775
I think I might be in the top three

296
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:25,578
amongst the currently existing
Korean YouTubers

297
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:26,812
for talking a lot.

298
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,081
You should at least be a soldier.

299
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:32,351
A starboard helmsman of the Turtle Ship.
Heave-ho, heave-ho!

be the same as female friends?

Then get in the shower right now!
Take a shower.

00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:40,359

- [male influencer 1] What?
- No way, whoa!

307
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:54,140
No. That's mad.

[all cheering]

309
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,112
I can't believe this.

310
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:02,548
[chuckles] In person.

311
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,716
[male influencer 2]
Hey, that's Jin Yong-jin.

312
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,185
- [female influencer] Hey, Yong-jin san.
- [male influencer 3] Is that Jin Yong-jin?

313
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:07,753
[female influencer] Yong-jin sama!

314
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,555
[male influencer 4] No way,
it's Jin Yong-jin.

315

[Ji-sou] I mean,
Yong-jin hyung is a madman.

318
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,230
I respect him a lot.

319
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,698
He could win, Jin Yong-jin nim.

320
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:21,534
- Jin Yong-jin nim.
- Jin Yong-jin.

321
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,570
I enjoy his channel
because the video quality is great.

322
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:25,938
I didn't expect him here.

323
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,140
[female influencer]
He's incredibly talented in everything.

324
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:29,842
Planning, directing, shooting and editing.

325
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:30,776
LITTLE SUNG-YUP
FITNESS YOUTUBER

326
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,611
It seems like he thinks
from the perspective of a producer

327
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,013
rather than a participant.

328
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,215
Maybe because he plans
and produces gameshows.

329
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:37,950
He might win.

330
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:39,585
Are we competing against a corporation?

331
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,221
[Yong-jin] I'm Jin Yong-jin, a director

332
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,824
and YouTuber with 27 million subscribers.

333
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,393
[Yong-jin] I started my channel
creating mystery videos

334
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,428
called "Answering Unanswered Questions."

335
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,832
Money Game is a survival program
which I also produced.

336
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:57,036
And I'm currently producing a web drama
called The Movie That Doesn't Exist.

337
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:59,972
I'm excited to see who'll be on the show,

338
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:03,909
and if the people and the events
will act and fold as I expected.

like vitamins to people,

Since I originally had a career

00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:25,744
I have the expertise to help people,
uniquely and effectively,

422
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,212
do their own makeup.

423

[Seo-a] I was so happy to see RISABAE.
I watch her live streams every day.

431
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:48,233
[female influencer] She looks
even more like an artist in person.

432
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:52,604
I know that "My little ladies
and gentlemen" can be found everywhere.

433
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:55,607
[RISABAE] So I think
there are probably some of them here too.

434
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,509
I mean, they are literally all over.

435
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,511

What?

444
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:19,531
I was a bit worried

445
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,567
that I went too far with my outfit.

446
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:24,069
Like these arm sleeves, a wig and all.

447
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,772
[Hyun-seo]
I thought I might look like a weirdo.

448
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,774
But someone had green hair,

449
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:31,510
there was a guy wearing pants
on the sides of his underwear.

450
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:33,679
I'm also wearing pants and underwear,

451
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:36,715
but he chose to do it
a little differently.

452
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:40,486
Normally, we only see the pants,
not the underwear.

453
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:42,588
[Hyun-seo] But I could see
his pants and the underwear.

454
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:44,156
I couldn't do that.

455
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,357
It's like he's got a cheat code.

[soft chuckle]
I thought I'd be the most extra.

459
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:55,634
I'd never imagined
he'd show up in that outfit.

460
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:59,238
I guess this is Netflix,
people all over the world watching.

[influencers whooping]

508
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:55,887
Hello, I'm fashion designer
Hwang Jae-keun.

509
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:59,691
Many people recognize me
because my face is easy to remember.

510
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:03,528
Considering that, I guess
I could be called an influencer, right?

511
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,698
He's the designer of all the masks
for King of Mask Singer.

512
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,701
- Is he really?
- I appeared on King of Mask Singer.

513
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,237

[BBULKUP] You are beautiful.

535
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:57,382
Seriously, what is this program?

536
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:01,253
But honestly,
Noona is the number one here.

537
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,654
I'll ask her out.

538
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,356
They said I'm famous in Apgujeong,

539
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,258
- but I told them it's only in that area.
- Noona.

00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,560
- Yes?
- [BBULKUP] You're so damn pretty.

00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:39,925
of the Korean YouTube community

557
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:42,427

558
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:43,662
My name is DaeDo.

559
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:47,432

563
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,542
The cast is crazy, Netflix.

564
00:22:57,609 --> 00:22:59,244
I mean, I was so surprised

565
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:00,779

[Seo-a] I can't believe
I get to see all the big names.

- Yes, she is.
- You look gorgeous!

579
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:28,540
- [female influencer 2] She is beautiful.
- Hello there.

580
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:31,543
Hello, my name is Ki Eun-se.

581
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,413
I'm an actress and an influencer as well.

582

[Eun-se] I like to make YouTube videos
about my everyday lifestyle.

583
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:42,120
And on Instagram,
I mostly showcase and talk about fashion.

This is next level.

00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:06,178
- [female influencer 1] 27 million?

00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:08,580
My name is Sia_jiwoo.

594
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:12,284
I'm a TikTok creator
with 27.5 million followers.

595
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:15,520
[Sia_jiwoo] Many people seem to enjoy
my dancing and fashion,

596
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:16,855
and are inspired by me.

597
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:19,157
I take pride in what I'm doing.

598
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:22,527
And if there's something
I want to achieve on this show,

599
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:24,563
it's promoting myself to the world.

601
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:27,999

- [female influencer] It's Sia!

602
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,367
[Carjinsung] Xia Junsu hyungnim.

603

[female influencer] You're so pretty!

605
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:37,042
Wow. 27 million? Incredible.

606
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:38,810
- She's a TikToker? Right.
- She is.

607
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:40,679
- TikTokers are on another level.
- I know.

608
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:41,746
27.5 million…

609
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,615
It's like
half of the South Korean population.

610
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:45,484
Her fandom's as big as some K-Pop groups.

611
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,118
Seoul, Incheon, and Gyeonggi's population.

612
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:48,954
- [male influencer] Right.
- Sia… Sia_jiwoo.

613

[WETBOY] A TikToker.

614
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:55,327
I think TikTok is a platform
where people are like the hexagon graph.

615
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:57,028
They only spike towards one angle.

TikTokers? They make easy money.

618
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:01,933
Who said that?

619
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,201
I'm angry now.

620
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:05,370
Korea's TikTok user base is small,

621
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:09,708
but Southeast Asia and the United States'
TikTok markets are significantly higher.

622
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:11,243
I don't agree with them

623
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:14,946
because it's a platform
that is well-recognized overseas.

624
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:17,549
People say
TikTokers are bubbles waiting to pop.

- [female influencer] Oh, that's Sherry!

629
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:28,293
Yeah, the TikTokers…
have a huge amount of followers.

630
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:30,195
I'm nothing compared to them.

631
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:32,931
I don't want to show my number.
I'll cover it.

632
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:34,900

00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:13,872
I want to be someone

651
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:16,608

I'm Yooxicman, and I cook meat.

00:26:57,749 --> 00:27:00,452
[Youngalnam] I talk about everything
that's related to English.

671
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:02,721
Lately, I also upload travel videos.

672
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:05,256
This is so much fun.

673
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:08,059
- [chimes]
- [rattling]

674
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:11,663
A shaman. Looks like
she makes content about shamanism.

675
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,999
- She must be a shaman.
- [female influencer] She's a shaman.

676
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:16,167
[Ji-sou] What an impression.
Shaman charisma!

677
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:17,435
Hello.

678
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:18,870
[RISABAE] She is a shaman for real.

679
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:20,105
IAMKATIECUTIE
SHAMAN

680
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:22,040
My name is iamkatiecutie,

681
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:24,442
and I'm a rising star on Instagram.

682
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:26,011
I'm an actual shaman.

683
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:29,314
My job's unique
and I want to be the top in my field.

684
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:32,384
[rhythmic music]

685
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,918
[female influencer] No way, really?

686
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:36,988
- [influencers cheering]
- [female influencer screaming]

687
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,925
[female influencer cheers]

688
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,561
Reject me and meet your demise.

689
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:46,931
Hello, I am GVAN, a drag artist.

690
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,600
[GVAN] My stomping ground is Itaewon,

691
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,202
where I perform shows
at specialized venues.

692
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:54,906
And I also create short-form videos
for online platforms.

693
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:58,343
I create all types of content
using the drag genre.

694
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:01,880
Since I'm an influencer
who is openly queer,

695
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:03,481
all these things that I do

696
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:06,651
can be a source of support
and strength to the people who work

697
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:08,286
in the community with me.

698
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:11,122
[male influencer whoops]

699
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,691
It's GVAN.

700
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:14,559
- Oh my.
- Yeah!

701
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:17,095
- I knew it. I knew that she would show up.
- Our drag queen has arrived.

702
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:18,997
[QYOUNG] GVAN! GVAN!

703
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:22,600
[influencers shouting, cheering]

704
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:23,935
What? What? What? What? What?

705
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:25,437
Oh, she's so pretty.

706
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:27,238
Hello!

707
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:29,140
Wait, it's a man. Ah.

708
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,375
Wow, he's a guy.

709
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:32,444
- My heart jumped. I didn't know.
- It surprised me.

710
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:35,847
I've seen you before
at the reserve forces training.

711
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:38,283
I saw you there. Mm-hmm.

712
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:39,651
I was going to say hello,

713
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:40,919
but I thought
you might not feel comfortable.

714
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:42,654
Please tell me
you didn't go dress like this.

715
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,656
- Of course I didn't.
- The reserve forces training?

716
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,324
Yes. The training was at Nogosan.

717
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:49,494
[CHAHONG] I feel like
I'm inside a social media apps.

718
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,129
[RISABAE] I do too, Director.

719
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:53,598
- [female influencer] You look cool.
- [DaeDo] Everyone here looks fancy.

720
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:56,334
Don't we have a host for the show?

721
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,536
- [Pure.D] Do we not have one?
- They'll probably appear on stage.

722
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:00,071
[A-reum-song-e]
I think it's only announcements.

723
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:01,539
[chimes]

724
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:02,674
[male influencer] Oh, someone else.

725
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:03,842
[female influencer]
Should be the last one.

726
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,644
[suspenseful music]

727
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:07,679
Is this it?

728
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:08,847
Who's the last one?

729
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,851
What?

730
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,421
- Whoa, he's an actual real celebrity.
- Wow.

731
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:17,689
What?

732
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:21,159
[female influencer] Oh, my God,
I can't believe who it is!

733
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:25,230
[influencers exclaiming, cheering]

734
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:28,066
[female influencer] Asia Prince.

735
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,202
- Oh, what?
- I guess we do have a host.

736
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,605
[male influencer] No way.

737
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,807
[RISABAE] The host is…

738
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:37,142
What?

739
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:38,810
Why is Jang Keun-suk here?

740
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:40,712
- A Netflix original project…
- [Eu-ddeum] What?

741
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:41,913
- …The Influencer.
- [female influencer] No way.

742
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,748
Hello, folks, I'm Jang Keun-suk!

743
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:47,218
[cheers and applause]

744
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,220
[male influencer]
This is so freaking surreal.

745
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,655
[female influencer] This is amazing.

746
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:53,158
Who will become The Influencer, ready?

747
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:55,460
[influencers] Yeah!

748
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:57,662
Okay, let's begin.

749
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:59,264
It's showtime!

750
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:02,233
[cheers and applause]

751
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:05,537
[influencers laughing, exclaiming]

752
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:07,405
He's perfect for this.

753
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:10,041
[Keun-suk] Hello, everyone. Hello.

754
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:11,042
Nice to meet you all.

755
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,778
[male influencer] He's handsome.

756
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:19,450
He's the perfect host for the show.

757
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:22,387
I almost had a heart attack
thinking he'd compete.

758
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:24,889
- Dude, he's the perfect host. No doubt.
- Totally.

759
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:26,491
We still have one more.

760
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,232
[tense music rises]

761
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:35,500
[male influencer 1] What?

762
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:37,435
- What if I get sent home now?
- Now he's wearing the neckband.

763
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,537
- [female influencer] Huh?
- What? He's wearing the collar.

764
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:41,239
- Oh, he's a participant?
- [male influencer 2] Oh…

765
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:42,407
[male influencer 3] Yeah.

766
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:44,275
[influencers exclaiming]

767
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,678
His follower number's on the collar too.

768
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:48,546
He must be the 77th participant.

769
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:50,915
[RISABAE] This is earth-shattering news.

770
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:53,885
Hello, I'm newbie influencer
Jang Keun-suk.

771
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,120
Advance thanks for guiding me along!

772
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:59,057
[influencers cheering, applauding]

773
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:01,359
He's the last one.

774
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,662
How do we compete
against a real celebrity?

775
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:07,365
It's not fair
if Jang Keun-suk ssi is a contender.

776
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:09,968
What? Is Jang Keun-suk a contender?

777
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,203
But I mean,
he's actually a newbie creator.

778
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:14,706
He just started his YouTube channel.

779
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:16,941
Hello.

780
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:18,276
It's me.

781
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:20,178
Yes, Jang Keun-suk.

782
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:24,215
[Keun-suk]
I made my debut as an actor 33 years ago,

783
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:26,517
and was also a singer in Japan.

784
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:28,553
I'm living my life to the fullest.

785
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,688
But I'm a newbie influencer.

786
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:34,425
I debuted as a YouTuber
only about nine months ago.

787
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:39,898
Looking back, I wonder
if I actually could be considered

788
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:42,533
a first-generation influencer.

789
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,202
I experienced both success

790
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:46,938
and decline
using a platform called Cyworld.

791
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:48,273
Because I was so young,

792
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:50,275
I made mistakes like being vain,

793
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:51,976
but I've grown from them.

794
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:54,679
Now I see myself as a prepared influencer.

795
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:57,048
Perhaps those experiences

796
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:59,117
ultimately led me to this program.

797
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:01,119
He's totally an influencer.

798
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:04,489
He's the Asia Prince and a YouTuber.
A celebrity.

799
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:06,190
He's perfect for the show.

800
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,793
- You know he's a global star.
- Why is he here?

801
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,229
Isn't he more of a celebrity
than an influencer?

802
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:13,598
I guess his fandom
will work to his advantage.

803
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:14,832
No celebs allowed.

804
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:16,834
This show is for people like us.

805
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:20,405
We're all fake famous
and then an actual celebrity shows up?

806
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:21,773
Eliminate him. Mm-hmm.

807
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,375
Hello, nice to meet you. Hello.

808
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,311
Hello, you got us good!

809
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:28,046
You're a participant?

810
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,081
- [laughs]
- [male influencer exclaims]

811
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:31,549
Please tell me you're the host.

812
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,351
- I'm just a participant.
- [DaeDo] You're the host and participant?

813
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:35,353
- [Changhyun] Just a participant?
- Yes, I might go home today.

814
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,555
- Can I sit here?
- Of course, yes.

815
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:40,625
- Okay.
- Jang Keun-suk's at our table.

816
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:42,961
[indistinct chatter]

HEO SEONG-BEOM, MODEL
RISABAE, FIRST-GEN BEAUTY CREATOR

818

OKING
STREAMER & YOUTUBER

819
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,734
Wow, so many famous people here.

820
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,202
[male influencer] The cast is insane.

821
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:52,670
This show's top -ier.

822
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:54,238
Are you okay, Yong-jin nim?

823
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,374
Yes, I'm good. Just thinking.

824
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:59,177
- About what we'll do?
- Yes, like what kind of games we'll play.

825
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:00,712
You'd be good at deduction games.

826
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:04,215
JIN YONG-JIN
YOUTUBER & DIRECTOR

827
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:07,285
[Yong-jin] I definitely have
more data than other people.

828
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:08,720
I think I'd be the best out of everyone

829
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:11,255
at understanding
the intentions of the showrunners.

830
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:13,725
This is basically a war.

831
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:16,694
Although we have some connections
with each other,

832
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:18,096
we're still competitors.

833
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,398
More subscribers equals more pressure.

834
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:23,868
[DaeDo] "I have 20 million subscribers,
of course I have to win."

835
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:26,204
If I can take advantage of that mentality,
it's possible.

836
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:29,774
[FITVELY] I feel confident now
because I have more followers than others.

837
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,876
Everyone except me is a loser, whatever.

838
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:35,580
[male influencer] It doesn't matter.
I'm winning.

839
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:38,116

Wow.

where 77 influencers

848
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:09,914
from South Korea
compete against each other

849
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:12,717
to be the most influential one.

850
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:16,087

In Round One, only 30 influencers

852
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:23,127
out of all of you participating
will survive.

853
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:25,830
[all gasp]

854
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:27,965
Oh, gosh.

855
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:29,901
- Today? What? Now?
- Yes.

856
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:30,935
Right now?

857
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:32,470
[male influencer] At first round?

858
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:34,172
I thought half would survive.

859
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:36,107
If it's only 30, I'm in danger.

860
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:38,109
Everyone here is so impressive.

861
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:39,944
I'm not sure if I can survive.

862
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:41,913
Only true influencers will make it.

863
00:34:41,979 --> 00:34:43,781
[RISABAE] I might not make the next round.

864
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:46,617
Oh, no. I hate this.

865
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:48,686
47 people will be eliminated.

866
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:49,887
This is only the first round.

867

[host] The number on your collar
represents the number of followers

868
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:56,127
you have
on your main social media platform.

869
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:57,061
Oh, really?

870
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:58,529

We will now reveal the follower rankings

872

874
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:10,608
Follower rankings?

875
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:12,210
What do you mean, rankings?

876
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,245
What the heck!

877
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:16,280
- Wait.
- Why are you announcing that?

878
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:18,649
[Sia_jiwoo] No, I'm scared.
I don't like this.

879
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:21,652
- I don't think you need to worry.
- I'm going to become the target.

880
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,354
I don't like this, for real.

[host]
We will now reveal the follower rankings

882

FOLLOWER RANKING

884
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:32,296
[iamkatiecutie] Why are they doing this?

885
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,866
I'm dead. I think I'll be at the bottom.

886
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:38,302
[male influencer] Oh, my God.

887
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:41,339

[female influencer 1]
Jang Keun-suk is in 34th place.

901
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:04,362
[male influencer] Oh, yeah, you're right.

902
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:07,165
- Jang Keun-suk nim is number 34.
- [female influencer 2 chuckles]

903
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:08,933
This is actually fair.

904
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,401
No, I'm far behind.

905
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:11,602
[GVAN] I'm 26th.

906
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:14,405
I've never experienced
being in 50th place anywhere.

907
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:16,807
[Ddolddol] This is so embarrassing.

908
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:19,177
[gasps] I'm in 71st.

909
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:21,179
74TH, KERRIGAN MAY, 45K

910
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:24,315
I'm freaking screwed.
I don't think I should be here.

911
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:25,883
I'm not last place.

912
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,051
76TH, IAMKATIECUTIE, 32K

913
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:28,119
I'm not last!

914
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:30,555
[Jae-keun] I'm the last.

915
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:32,757
[male influencer] I mean,
this is kind of a lot.

916
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:35,660
- [female influencer] This is cruel.
- Who's the top?

917
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:37,562
1ST, SIA_JIWOO, 27.5M

918
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:39,797
- [male influencer 1] 27 million?
- [female influencer] Wow, what is that?

919
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,200
[male influencer 2]
There's no way I could beat 27.5 million.

920
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:44,569
Uh, do you know who Sia_jiwoo is?

921
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:46,404
Who is Sia_jiwoo?

922
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,472
Who are Sia_jiwoo and KEJIMIN?

923
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:51,409
- I'm the--
- We're first and second.

924
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:52,810
What do we do?

925
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:53,811
We're doomed.

926
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:54,946
[male influencer] 36th place?

927
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:56,681
- Why are we sitting together?
- Right.

928
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:58,082
How did we end up like this?

929
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:01,619
So the top rankers,
one to six, are all TikTokers.

930
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:03,654
- Right.
- Oh, I beat Doctor Who.

931
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:04,956
- 28th place?
- I'm happy.

932
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:06,424
- [female influencer] Why do you care?
- [GATO] I can go home now.

933
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,858
8TH, SHERRY, 2.3M, TIKTOK

934
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:10,461
[host]
The winning prize for The Influencer is…

935
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,463
300 million won.

936
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:15,933
[all exclaim in shock]

937
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,735
- [male influencer] Yeah.
- [female influencer] What?

938
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:19,403
That sounds tempting.

939
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,905
300 million?

940
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:22,506
My nostrils were flaring.

941
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,675
I was excited just thinking about winning.

942
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:27,411
[Changhyun] That's my money.
I'm going to win that.

943
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:29,981
[FITVELY] I have
exactly that amount in debt right now.

944
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:33,417
That's it. It's a chance given by God.

945
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:35,453
That's a lot of money, right?

946
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:38,055
[CHAHONG] And I thought,
"Well, this is about to get brutal."

947
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:40,625
[host] In The Influencer,

948
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:43,961
the number of followers
represents your worth.

949
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:45,229
[male influencer] Oh.

950
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:46,964
[female influencer]
Why are you doing this to us?

951
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:48,566
[host] During your time here,

952
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:51,402
- your worth becomes your status and power.
- [exclaims]

953
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:54,272
- [male influencer] Our status and power?
- This is crazy.

954
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:56,474
[host] We will now reveal your worth.

955
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:01,078
The prize money of 300 million won is
converted to the ratio of your followers.

956
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:02,313
My worth?

957
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:04,548
- They're converting it?
- Yes.

958
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,950
[PaniBottle] The more followers you have,

959
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:07,251
- the more you get?
- [Changhyun] Yeah. That's it.

960
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:09,654
[tense music]

961
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,056
[digital trilling]

962
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:17,495
I'm scared.

963
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:19,497
It'll show on our collars.

964
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:20,865
- Huh?
- On the collar?

965
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:21,866
SHIM EU-DDEUM
CONVERTED WORTH: 4.01M

966
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:23,000
Oh, my goodness.

967
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:25,670
- How much does it say?
- 770,000.

968
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:26,737
HEO SEONG-BEOM
CONVERTED WORTH: 770K

969
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,539
Why are the numbers so low?

970
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:30,641
JINJEOLME
CONVERTED WORTH: 200K

971
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:31,976
[male influencer] Anybody want to buy me?

972
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,844
27,630,000?

973
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:35,646
MEJIWOO
CONVERTED WORTH: 27.63M

974
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:38,816
- It's around 26 million won.
- It's 26,330,000!

975
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:39,784
SSOYOUNG, 26.33M

976
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:41,152
[Mejiwoo]
I think I should hide my numbers.

977
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:42,586
[female influencer] You are rich.

978
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:46,457
I was so proud.
I was holding my head high. [chuckles]

979
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:49,493
I was walking around like this. [chuckles]

980
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:52,630
Why am I worth only one million won?

981
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:53,864
How much am I? How much?

982
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:55,666
- [RISABAE] It's 730,000.
- Oh, that's it?

983
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:56,734
I'm in the lowest class.

984
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:58,769
I really didn't feel like I could compete.

985
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,371
So, can we, like, spend this money?

986
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:03,641
[Kerrigan May]
Wow, you're worth 5,640,000 won!

987
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:05,476
[Eu-ddeum] I felt good.

988
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:07,645
I thought, "Well, it's doable."

989
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:10,281
- Please take care of me, hyungnim.
- Oh, me too.

990
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,749
[Ji-sou] I got 3,080,000.

991
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:14,418
I think converting it into money
makes it more fun,

992
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:17,254
rather than just competing
with follower count.

993
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:19,657
[DaeDo] Seeing my worth
translated into money was wild.

994
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:21,158
I felt naked.

995
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:23,427
This is really rough.

996
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:26,897
I'm not falling behind anyone
in real life.

997
00:39:26,964 --> 00:39:28,366
But here I am.

998
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:30,601
1,940,000.

999
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:32,937
[laughs]

1000
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:36,907
Of course I feel offended.

1001
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:39,176
I'm definitely worth more than this,
I mean… [chuckles]

1002
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:40,878
- 630,000.
- That's it?

1003
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:42,279
[Carjinsung] It's not even one million.

1004
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:44,682
I bet this was their plan
in the first place.

1005
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:48,085
It really pissed people off.
I'm only worth 190,000.

1006
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:51,956
I was like "Who do you think you are
putting a price tag on me?" [laughs]

1007
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:55,226
Man, that's too harsh. I'm embarrassed.

1008
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:56,394
I only have enough for gas

1009
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,195
- on my way home.
- [female influencer laughs]

1010
00:39:58,262 --> 00:39:59,697
This is annoying.

1011
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:01,732
How much is the top rank worth?

1012
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:03,634
How much does Sia_jiwoo nim have?

1013
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:06,370
Hey, cover it up. It's too much pressure.

1014
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:07,705
[Changhyun] Sia nim, let me see.

1015
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:09,039
Sia nim, please let me see.

1016
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,742
[Changhyun] How much is it? How much?

1017
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:12,810
60 million won?

1018
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:14,545
- [male influencer] 60 million?
- [QYOUNG] Oh, my goodness gracious.

1019
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:16,547
- 68,900,000?
- [QYOUNG] That is wild.

1020
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:17,548
Embarrassing.

1021
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:19,150
She's 60 million won.

1022
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:20,418
- 60 million?
- Yeah.

1023
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:22,620
[Sia_jiwoo] I felt really uncomfortable.

1024
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:27,892
Everyone's attention
was focused directly on me.

1025
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:30,094
I was scared in that moment.

1026
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:32,630
[host]
The worth of the eliminated influencer

1027
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:35,366
- will be absorbed by the survivors.
- [influencers exclaim]

1028
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,268
Our combined worth is 300 million?

1029
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:38,669
- I think so.
- Right?

1030
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:41,539
[host]
The final survivor of The Influencer

1031
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,908
will receive 300 million won.

1032
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:45,709
I'm targeting Sia_jiwoo.

1033
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,611
[Caddiewanny]
If I beat the person with 60 million,

1034
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:48,946
I'll be in first place, right?

1035
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:50,247
[DaeDo] That's right.

1036
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:52,450
[host] To all the influencers,

1037
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:55,653
we will now begin Round One.

1038
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:57,455
- [all cheering]
- [Carjinsung] This is going to be fun!

1039
00:40:57,521 --> 00:40:59,123
Let's do it! Okay, let's go!

1040
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,424
Let's go! Let's go!

1041
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:03,160
- [male influencer] Let's go! Let's go!
- [female influencer] Oh, I'm nervous.

1042
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:07,364
[host] Round One is a voting round.

1043
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:08,432
[all exclaiming]

1044
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:10,167
- [RISABAE] Ugh, why though?
- [male influencer 1] We're voting?

1045
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:12,436
- [male influencer 2] 1 Wow, that's wild.
- [male influencer 3] A vote?

1046
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:13,737
What kind of voting?

1047
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:14,939
[host] From now on,

1048
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:18,342
each of you must cast a total of 30 votes,

1049
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:22,480
15 votes for like
and 15 votes for dislike.

1050
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:24,215
Oh, my God!

1051
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:25,883
[female influencer 1] Voting for dislikes?

1052
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,718
Wow, this is scary.

1053
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:30,454
- I'm suffocating.
- [female influencer 2] I'm getting scared.

1054
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:32,890
[host] The voting will be anonymous,

1055
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:35,526
and you can vote
through The Influencer app

1056
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:38,562
which you all have installed
on your phones.

1057
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:39,830
[chimes]

1058
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:42,066
You have two hours.

1059
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:44,101
- [male influencer] Two?
- Two hours?

1060
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:47,471
They're giving us two hours
for this mission?

1061
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:49,340
[Keun-suk]
I don't think we need two hours.

1062
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:53,210
- I guess we have to be good at talking.
- You're right.

1063
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:55,246
So don't do things
that will get you a dislike.

1064
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:57,948
- Let's be friends, you and me.
- [female influencer] Sure.

1065
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:01,752
[host] The collar you are all wearing
contains an NFC chip

1066
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:05,556
with each of your short-form videos
introducing yourselves.

1067
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:06,757
[beeps]

1068
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:10,895
If you're curious about someone,
try tagging them with your phone.

1069
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:14,131
You can then watch
their introduction videos.

1070
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,067
Oh, like this? Ah.

1071
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:20,571
[host] Furthermore,
there will be a separate announcement…

1072
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:24,742
for a talent show
where you can showcase yourself.

1073
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,712
And with that, the voting will now begin.

1074
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:30,548
- [Ddolddol] This is way too cruel.
- [Eu-ddeum] Let's do this!

1075
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:32,016
- [male influencer 1] I'm so curious.
- Let me see yours.

1076
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:34,251
- [male influencer 2] Just tap it.
- If I tag my-- Oh.

1077
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:35,519
Oh, I see it, I see it.

1078
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,055
You can vote just like this?

1079
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:39,590
YOU RECEIVED A LIKE

1080
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:42,760
Oh, a message pops up
if you have a new like, I guess.

1081
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:44,295
- [Jaymeeforyou] Yeah, it does.
- Cool.

1082
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:46,096
YOU RECEIVED A LIKE

1083
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:49,567
[QYOUNG] My strategy is to get a lot
of likes and as few dislikes as possible.

1084
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:52,836
[DanceKang] Of course, it's important
for influencers to get likes.

1085
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:55,306
The person who gets the most likes
will win the game.

1086
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:56,907
Please give your vote for me.

1087
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:00,678
I really think
everyone here likes you, Unni.

1088
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,680
- You think so?
- I'm really happy about that.

1089
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:05,249
[Eu-ddeum] People were excited
when you showed up earlier,

1090
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:06,717
- starting with me.
- Really?

1091
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:10,421
SABAE nim, I wanted to tell you
that the coolest thing I have done here

1092
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:11,755
is to meet you in person.

1093
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:14,525
- [RISABAE] Really?
- I'm one of your "little ladies."

1094
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,660
You are the reason why I started my career

1095
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:19,063
as an online streamer on AfreecaTV, Unni.

1096
00:43:19,129 --> 00:43:20,464
- [RISABAE] You're Seo-a, right?
- Yeah.

1097
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:22,633
Your video totally deserves a like.

1098
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,970
- Aw, really? Thank you so much.
- Seriously, this is so cool.

1099
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:26,904
YOU RECEIVED A LIKE

1100
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:28,572
JUNGHYUN SENT RISABAE A LIKE

1101
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,640
Thank you.

1102
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:31,375
- Oh, my goodness.
- I'm really glad to meet you today.

1103
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,010
- Noona, I'm a huge fan.
- [RISABAE] I am. I appreciate it.

1104
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:35,245
It's my dream to have a concert with you
when I become more successful.

1105
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:36,480
That would be great.

1106
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:38,949
I'm pretty confident in getting likes

1107
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:43,287
because I think most people I met here
were genuinely welcoming to me.

1108
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:45,255
[RISABAE] Some people even said,
"I love you, SABAE"

1109
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:46,991
before they gave me a like.

1110
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:50,327
- I'm so honored.
- So am I.

1111
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:51,862
[Jinjalim] Oh, you are Heo Seong-beom,

1112
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:53,564
- the KAIST engineering student.
- [Seong-beom] Yeah, thank you.

1113
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:56,000
- Yes, I am. Oh, thanks.
- I'm sending you a like right now.

1114
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:57,635
JINJALIM SENT HEO SEONG-BEOM A LIKE
YOU RECEIVED A LIKE

1115
00:43:57,701 --> 00:43:59,003
Hi, I'm Seong-beom.

1116
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:02,106
A 24-year-old
engineering student at KAIST.

1117
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:03,574
HEO SEONG-BEOM
MODEL

1118
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,242
Why is my pronunciation strange?

1119
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,011
I'm shooting this for the fourth time.
[chuckles]

1120
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:11,382
[Seong-beom] "My calculus solutions video
by KAIST engineering student" went viral.

1121
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:14,018
I went from 60K to 320K in a month.

1122
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:15,452
This surprised me too.

1123
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,621
- [indistinct chatter]
- [Heheonni gasps]

1124
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:19,256
That's me.

1125
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:23,727
Oh, my God, I knew it!

1126
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:27,564
- Thank you.
- [Heheonni] Wow, this is cool.

1127
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:29,667
- [Mejiwoo] I'll give you a like.
- [Seong-beom] Thank you.

1128
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:30,734
[Mejiwoo] Oh, thanks.

1129
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:33,637
[Claire] I know that video.
Oh, my gosh, this is crazy.

1130
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:35,472
I even shared your video
to a friend of mine.

1131
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:36,473
Oh, did you?

1132
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:37,908
After they watched my video,

1133
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:39,943
they said "Oh, you're the guy?"
and knew me.

1134
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:42,913
It made me happy to think
that people here saw me

1135
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:45,482
and recognized me
even though I'm a newbie.

1136
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:48,285
[beeping]

1137
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:50,888
Oh. This is nuts.

1138
00:44:50,954 --> 00:44:53,223
I, uh, I just received two dislikes.
[chuckles]

1139
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:55,159
- How did you know that?
- [GATO] You got dislikes?

1140
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:56,527
It pops up on the screen.

1141
00:44:56,593 --> 00:44:58,128
A pop-up screen shows up saying,

1142
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:59,730
- "You have a new dislike".
- Ah.

1143
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:01,532
- There's not a total?
- [Caddiewanny] This is so funny.

1144
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:02,566
- No total number.
- Ah.

1145
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:04,401
That means being well-known
might not be a good thing.

1146
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:05,335
Exactly.

1147
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:09,106
So, someone could send me a dislike
just to eliminate me.

1148
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:10,941
Even without watching the video?

1149
00:45:11,008 --> 00:45:13,711
That could happen.
"I don't like this guy," so they dislike.

1150
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:15,879
I know that men usually don't like me.

1151
00:45:15,946 --> 00:45:19,116
But I'm panicked, I haven't done
anything to get these dislikes.

1152
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:23,554
As soon as the announcement
"The first mission now begins" ended,

1153
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:25,823
I received three or four dislikes.

1154
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:28,926
That's when I thought,
"Wow, this game is brutal."

1155
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:30,027
Oh.

1156
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:31,462
YOU RECEIVED A DISLIKE

1157
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:34,565
- What? What is it?
- Oh, no. Someone just gave me a dislike.

1158
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:37,167
- [Hyun-seo] Somebody's targeting you.
- Oh, no. Oh, my God!

1159
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:41,972
No matter how many likes I have,
I'll be doomed if I get more dislikes.

1160
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:45,109
So I negotiated with people
not to give dislikes to each other.

1161
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:47,644
It's okay to not give each other likes,
but don't send dislikes.

1162
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:48,812
[Ddolddol] Right, right.

1163
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:50,280
As long as you don't give me a dislike…

1164
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:51,849
[DaeDo] Please don't give me a dislike.

1165
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,817
- Seriously.
- That makes sense.

1166
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:56,120
- Promise. Promise.
- [DaeDo] I promise. I promise.

1167
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:57,688

Hey, listen to me for a second.

1332
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:39,182
Are you going to eliminate people
based on their video?

1333
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:40,817
- Why do you ask?
- I'm not.

1334
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,085
Okay, then hear me out.

1335
00:53:42,652 --> 00:53:44,120
We all have a rank.

1336
00:53:44,187 --> 00:53:48,291
The people who have a lot of subscribers
or are popular have an advantage.

1337
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:50,327
We need to think like politicians.

1338
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:51,995
- Totally. This is politics.
- Well, I mean…

1339
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:54,364
- Like, it's damn political.
- [Ji-sou] 60 mil goes home first.

1340
00:53:54,431 --> 00:53:56,433
- [Yong-jin] Why?
- [Ji-sou] She's at the top, why not?

1341
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,568
Add her fund to the pot.

1342
00:53:58,635 --> 00:53:59,703
[PaniBottle] Target number one.

1343
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:01,471
- [Ji-sou] We need to send her home.
- [female influencer] Look at mine.

1344
00:54:03,006 --> 00:54:04,140
[PaniBottle] Listen.

1345
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:07,310
What matters more is who we give
our dislikes to, not our likes.

1346
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:08,712
We have to give both out.

1347
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:10,513
Let's form a team of 15 people

1348
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:13,116
and discuss who to give
our dislikes to and eliminate.

1349
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:15,085
We can also give likes to each other.

1350
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:17,721
Then who should we give dislikes to?

1351
00:54:17,787 --> 00:54:18,788
The rich ones.

1352
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:21,157
[PaniBottle]
The survivors will get the money.

1353
00:54:21,224 --> 00:54:22,959
- Yeah, exactly…
- But I don't think money

1354
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:25,195
is a good reason to target people.

1355
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:27,831
Other people could target us
for the same thing.

1356
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:29,466
[PaniBottle]
I don't think talking about the money

1357
00:54:29,532 --> 00:54:30,867
is going to work, hyungnim.

1358
00:54:31,401 --> 00:54:33,570
Let's target Short-form creators.

1359
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:37,641
[PaniBottle] I see Shorts creators
and TikTokers as strong competitors.

1360
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:41,478
I think in a survival game,
it's only right for participants

1361
00:54:41,544 --> 00:54:46,449
to seek out the best way to survive,
regardless of their means and methods.

1362
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:48,785
To make it to the next rounds,
you need to put pressure

1363
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:52,255
on the strongest competitors
while you still can.

1364
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:53,690
- [PaniBottle] Yeah.
- We can work as a team.

1365
00:54:53,757 --> 00:54:55,892
YouTubers, TikTokers.

1366
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:57,927
- [PaniBottle] Us versus them?
- Yeah.

1367
00:54:57,994 --> 00:54:59,162
That sounds good.

1368
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:01,898
We need to survive the first round
to make it through to the next one.

1369
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,133
[PaniBottle] Yeah, 77.

1370
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:05,302
[Changhyun]
It'll be easier if we work as a team.

1371
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:07,070
It's a good reason to give likes.

1372
00:55:07,871 --> 00:55:10,707
- So… you're a YouTuber, right?
- I am.

1373
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:11,841
- You?
- Nothing's been decided,

1374
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:14,311
but we think
Shorts creators have too many followers.

1375
00:55:14,377 --> 00:55:15,211
[Pure.D] You do?

1376
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:17,614
[PaniBottle] Our plan is to give them
as many dislikes as possible.

1377
00:55:17,681 --> 00:55:19,516
- [Pure.D] Get rid of them?
- [Yong-jin] Others will agree.

1378
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:22,519
- [Pure.D] Like platform against platform?
- [PaniBottle] Exactly. And I thought…

1379
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:25,655
- TikTokers? I see.
- [PaniBottle] Let's target TikTokers.

1380
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:27,891
All the top rankers are TikTokers, right?

1381
00:55:27,957 --> 00:55:31,761
From what I saw,
some people have 70 million--

1382
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,496
[Pure.D] She's right next to you.

1383
00:55:33,563 --> 00:55:35,965
She's right next to you.
She is the one in first place.

1384
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:37,634
- [Juice Seyeon] Watched my video?
- [PaniBottle splutters]

1385
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:39,636
- [Juice Seyeon] Can I see yours too?
- [PaniBottle] I almost had a heart attack.

1386
00:55:39,703 --> 00:55:41,171
- [Pure.D] Sure.
- [PaniBottle] I didn't see her.

1387
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:42,539
[Woo-hyeon] Me too.

1388
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:44,774
[PaniBottle] Oh, here.

1389
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:49,346
- Um, what do you mean?
- [PaniBottle] Your strategy.

1390
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:53,950
[Sia_jiwoo] People are talking about
who to eliminate to benefit themselves.

1391
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:57,821
That's when I started to realize
something was very wrong.

1392
00:55:57,887 --> 00:55:59,756
[male influencer 1] So then I thought,
"This won't work."

1393
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:01,257
And I crawled under the table.

1394
00:56:01,324 --> 00:56:03,493
YOU RECEIVED A DISLIKE

1395
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,595
- [male influencer 1] I had to live, right?
- [tense music]

1396
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:07,163
[female influencer] Please watch it.

1397
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:08,832
- What's your number?
- [male influencer 2] Oh, one sec.

1398
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:12,535
YOU RECEIVED A DISLIKE

1399
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:13,970
[male influencer 3] Holy shit.

1400
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:16,072
[indistinct chatter]

1401
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:17,507
I thought it might be funny.

1402
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:19,743
Can you tell me if you think it is or not?

1403
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:21,311
I think you'll get too many likes,
Jiwoo nim.

1404
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:25,949
- I'm actually getting some dislikes.
- [Sherry] Really? I got some too.

1405
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:34,724
Are you done voting?

1406
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:36,860
[Soo-jin] You don't want to?

1407
00:56:37,527 --> 00:56:40,029
I'm getting really worn out.

1408
00:56:40,797 --> 00:56:43,333
Too many followers is making me a target.

1409
00:56:44,033 --> 00:56:45,068
I'm scared.

1410
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:47,237
You're a competition.

1411
00:56:47,303 --> 00:56:49,539
Heavy is the head that wears the crown.

1412
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:51,307
[indistinct laughter]

1413
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:53,042
[THISISMATÉ] You must be terrified.

1414
00:57:02,552 --> 00:57:05,021
[somber music]

1415
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:12,896
[Sia_jiwoo]
I put a lot of effort into my video,

1416
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:15,265
and I don't think
it deserved any dislikes.

1417
00:57:15,865 --> 00:57:18,668
And the fact
that people were sending me dislikes

1418
00:57:18,735 --> 00:57:21,137
to eliminate me made me so upset.

1419
00:57:21,204 --> 00:57:23,239
[indistinct chatter]

1420
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:28,745
I think it's a good idea
for us TikTokers to play as a team

1421
00:57:28,812 --> 00:57:31,014
and send dislikes
to the people from other platforms.

1422
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:32,916
How?

1423
00:57:33,483 --> 00:57:35,819
- [Sherry] We need to survive.
- That's true.

1424
00:57:35,885 --> 00:57:37,654
[Sherry] Let's get 15 TikTokers

1425
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,489
and give all our dislikes
to the same people?

1426
00:57:40,056 --> 00:57:41,024
[KEJIMIN] You're right.

1427
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:44,027
I think we need strategies
if we want to survive this round.

1428
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:47,497
[Youngalnam] It's turning into a battle
between platforms. Interesting.

1429
00:57:47,564 --> 00:57:50,533
I've been telling everyone
that we need to target Shorts creators.

1430
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:51,768
[PaniBottle] We have to because--

1431
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:53,770
[FITVELY] I was told to come talk
to the Team YouTube Captain.

1432
00:57:53,837 --> 00:57:56,239
- He's one of us.
- I'm not the captain. Who said that?

1433
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,607
[FITVELY]
Everyone told me to meet you here.

1434
00:57:57,674 --> 00:57:59,209
- How did I… This is nuts.
- [comical music]

1435
00:57:59,275 --> 00:58:01,044
He and I were talking about
having the same ideas.

1436
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:01,945
Why me though?

1437
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:03,847
- You're the captain of Team YouTubers.
- [Youngalnam] Just own it.

1438
00:58:03,913 --> 00:58:06,149
- Lead us, Captain.
- The plan is this.

1439
00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:09,219
- Target the short-form creators.
- Want me to take their phones?

1440
00:58:09,285 --> 00:58:10,954
We have to find them, just scan-- [yelps]

1441
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:13,223
- Ouch. Oh, no. What's going on?
- What the hell? Ow.

1442
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:14,824
Are you okay? Ouch, ouch. Shoot.

1443
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:15,992
What the heck is going on?

1444
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:18,061
- How would I know what happened?
- [PaniBottle] What the hell was that?

1445
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:21,564
- Why is there so much static? Oh, man.
- I'm producing static electricity. Yeah.

1446
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:23,733
- [PaniBottle] Okay, let me say one thing.
- Oh, I'm listening.

1447
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,368
I like Needmorecash a lot.

1448
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:26,503
- Who?
- I like him but…

1449
00:58:26,569 --> 00:58:30,039
- [Yooxicman] I love Needmorecash.
- We need to… eliminate him.

1450
00:58:30,106 --> 00:58:31,674
- What was his name?
- Needmore…

1451
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:33,910
- [Youngalnam] Needmore…
- [PaniBottle] Needmorecash.

1452
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,579
I watch a lot of his videos, and…

1453
00:58:36,646 --> 00:58:37,514
- he only makes short…
- Tell me, and I'll attack.

1454
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,682
- I-I don't strategize.
- …short-form videos.

1455
00:58:39,749 --> 00:58:41,050
- You got it, Captain.
- I think you're right.

1456
00:58:41,117 --> 00:58:43,119
[PaniBottle] I mean,
this seems like the only way that we can…

1457
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:44,787
- [Youngalnam] Yeah.
- …even hope to survive.

1458
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:46,990
Captain, who's next up?

1459
00:58:47,056 --> 00:58:49,058
- First, scan everyone's NFC code.
- Oh, okay. Yeah. Got it.

1460
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:51,160
- Scan them first?
- Remember, the Shorts creators.

1461
00:58:51,227 --> 00:58:52,829
- Ah.
- Okay, that's it for now.

1462
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:54,697
- Great.
- [sighs]

1463
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:56,366
That's why he's the leader.

1464
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:58,935
YOUNGALNAM SENT SIA_JIWOO A DISLIKE

1465
00:58:59,002 --> 00:59:00,403
To make it to the next round…

1466
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:01,671
Listen to the captain.

1467
00:59:01,738 --> 00:59:04,474
- Not again. Who said that I'm the captain?
- [Sanghyuk] Okay.

1468
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,342
Everyone says
you're Team YouTube's captain.

1469
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:07,877
- [FITVELY] Captain.
- [PaniBottle] What?

1470
00:59:07,944 --> 00:59:09,612
[FITVELY] Should I take their phones
so they can't give dislikes?

1471
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:11,681
- No, you're not supposed to do that.
- I can't?

1472
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:12,916
- I can't do that?
- You can't do that.

1473
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:15,585
We're not supposed to fight anybody?
Why not?

1474
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:18,087
- No way. Come here, man.
- [FITVELY] Okay. Okay.

1475
00:59:18,154 --> 00:59:20,690
Go and exchange likes now
while you still can.

1476
00:59:20,757 --> 00:59:22,458
You can't do it later.

1477
00:59:22,525 --> 00:59:24,193
- If other people run out of likes…
- Oh, I won't be able to negotiate.

1478
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:25,828
- Right, so hurry.
- If they ran out…

1479
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:27,630
- If they used up… Right, yeah.
- Got it.

1480
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:32,669
[FITVELY] Hello,
are you looking for a suitable mate?

1481
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,637
[chuckles]
Do you mind if I become your mate?

1482
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:35,905
[chimes]

1483
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:37,840
Wait, what is this?

1484
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:41,077
[host] The talent show will begin now.

1485
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:42,979
The talent show.

1486
00:59:43,046 --> 00:59:44,113
Talent show?

1487
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:48,685
[host] Influencers who wish
to promote themselves to the group

1488
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:52,655
can utilize the circular stage
in the center to showcase their talent.

MAGENTA

1491
00:59:55,325 --> 00:59:56,659
I'm not sure, but yeah.

1492
00:59:56,726 --> 01:00:00,563
Do you think anyone will actually give
a like after watching somebody perform?

1493
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:02,765
[FITVELY]
No, I think people will give a dislike.

1494
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:04,267
Who's going up?

1495
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,705
[Changhyun] Excuse me,
can I use this microphone?

1496
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,940
- [staff] Sure, go ahead. Yeah, yeah.
- [Changhyun] Okay. thank you.

1497
01:00:11,007 --> 01:00:13,876
Is there anyone out there
who will be brave enough to go first?

1498
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:16,412
[Changhyun]
If you want to promote yourself,

1499
01:00:16,479 --> 01:00:18,781
just be aware that the sooner, the better.

1500
01:00:18,848 --> 01:00:20,883
Don't wait
until everyone's used up their likes.

1501
01:00:21,718 --> 01:00:23,653
There's no point
when there aren't any likes to give.

1502
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:24,954
- [Soo-jin] Go first. Do it.
- Oh, me?

1503
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:26,923
- I might mess up if I go now.
- [Soo-jin] You're fine.

1504
01:00:27,657 --> 01:00:29,626
YOU RECEIVED A DISLIKE

1505
01:00:29,692 --> 01:00:31,828
[Changhyun]
I got dislikes for just going up there.

1506
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:34,464
- I told you not to go up.
- You were right about that.

1507
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:36,499
- Uh-huh.
- This is scary.

1508
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:38,301
[KEJIMIN] I'm nervous.

1509
01:00:38,368 --> 01:00:40,003

You got this!

1514
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:49,846
- [FITVELY] She's a TikToker. Isn't she?
- Huh?

1515
01:00:49,912 --> 01:00:50,913
- Yeah, KEJIMIN.
- Right?

1516
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:53,483
Wow, look. She has 11 million.

1517
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:54,884
[FITVELY] 11 million?

1518
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:56,419
- [Yooxicman] Yeah.
- [Youngalnam] That's a lot.

1519
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:59,122
She went up there
and reminded us all to give her a dislike.

1520
01:00:59,188 --> 01:01:00,723
- Thanks to her for reminding me.
- I'm going for it.

1521
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:02,091
YOUNGALNAM SENT KEJIMIN A DISLIKE

1522
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:04,093
Hey, wait until after she performs?

1523
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,362
She's getting ready.
I don't want her to panic.

1524
01:01:07,597 --> 01:01:08,698
Oh, you sent it?

1525
01:01:09,966 --> 01:01:11,834
- I don't think she'll check yet.
- You're right.

1528
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:20,309
- [Ji-sou] She's gonna dance.
- Dance?

1529
01:01:20,376 --> 01:01:22,612

1535
01:01:38,895 --> 01:01:42,298
- [Ddolddol] She's really flexible.
- She must be a dancer, right?

1536
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:45,635
She is a member of TAEKWONCRE.
She does Taekwondo performances.

1537

1541
01:01:54,977 --> 01:01:57,780
Wow! Oh, yeah!

1542
01:01:57,847 --> 01:01:59,582
[male influencer] She's really good.

1543
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:01,751
- [WETBOY] 11 million followers?
- Send her home.

1544
01:02:01,818 --> 01:02:04,454
She's busy making videos.
She's wasting time here.

1545
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:05,388
[Soo-jin] You did great.

1546
01:02:05,455 --> 01:02:06,756

1548
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:11,194

- [KEJIMIN] Oh, no.

1554
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:26,175
I panicked big time.

1555
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:28,111
[KEJIMIN]
I really wanted to survive this round.

1556
01:02:28,177 --> 01:02:31,247
And I was pretty satisfied
with my performance,

1557
01:02:31,314 --> 01:02:33,015
knowing that I gave it my all.

1558
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:34,984
And then, when I looked at my phone,

1559
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:38,054
there were seven dislikes in a row.
Like, rapid fire.

1560
01:02:38,121 --> 01:02:40,256
I felt like I couldn't even breathe,
you know?

1561
01:02:40,323 --> 01:02:41,424
And guess what?

1562
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:43,292
If I hadn't done that performance,

1563
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:45,228
I wouldn't have received dislikes.

1564
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:47,463
What the heck?

1565
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:50,099
I'm waiting for your next order.

1566
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:52,502
- Do you guys know GATO?
- No, I don't.

1567
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:56,272
Look, GATO is a TikToker. I can just tell.

[sighs]

1573
01:03:04,914 --> 01:03:06,415
I keep getting dislikes.

1574
01:03:08,084 --> 01:03:09,619
The reason I think that is…

1575
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:13,156
All of a sudden like
"ding, ding, ding, ding", just came in.

1576
01:03:13,222 --> 01:03:14,891
That can only mean people teamed up.

1577
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:17,326
- Okay, that's enough for now.
- Okay.

1578
01:03:17,393 --> 01:03:19,495
- We can do more after, like, 20 minutes.
- All right, I'll be back.

1579
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:21,998
Let's target the people
in the upper ranks first.

1580
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:25,134

01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:19,922
Got the feeling that
I was getting dislikes. Got a gut feeling.

1601
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:21,757
They probable didn't like it.

1618
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:22,551
I'm the only one
who did something stupid to get dislikes.

1619
01:05:23,686 --> 01:05:25,121
I got a lot too.

1620
01:05:25,187 --> 01:05:26,756
[WETBOY] Don't go up there. Don't do it.

1621
01:05:26,822 --> 01:05:29,425
- It's much better to stay lowkey.
- Right.

1622
01:05:29,492 --> 01:05:31,193
It's better just to stay here.

1623
01:05:31,861 --> 01:05:33,896
Honestly, I prepared something
but I'm too scared.

1624
01:05:33,963 --> 01:05:36,599
- [DaeDo] Give it a try. You'll be fine.
- No, I can't. I'm too scared.

1625
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:38,000
- No, don't. It's better not to.
- You're right.

1626
01:05:38,067 --> 01:05:39,702
Especially if you don't have any dislikes.

1627
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:40,770

1628

[Yooxicman]
Why does it feel so weirdly quiet?

1629
01:05:42,972 --> 01:05:45,341
[DaeDo] No one wants
to go up and collect dislikes.

1630
01:05:45,408 --> 01:05:47,410
I want people to go up and do something.

1631
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:49,779
[Caddiewanny]
They're too afraid to get dislikes.

1632
01:05:49,845 --> 01:05:51,514
[Yong-jin]
I bet the producers expected this.

1633
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:52,648
[Caddiewanny] Is there a twist?

1634
01:05:52,715 --> 01:05:55,017
Yeah, I think
there's something about the dislikes.

1635
01:05:55,685 --> 01:05:57,253
- [Caddiewanny] You do?
- Yeah.

1636
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:02,658
- [DogJOY] Are you out of likes? Darn.
- Yeah.

1637
01:06:02,725 --> 01:06:04,460
- I have to give out my dislikes.
- What now?

1638
01:06:04,527 --> 01:06:06,696
What about my dislikes? What do I do?

1639
01:06:06,762 --> 01:06:08,397
- [KINKY] I don't want to give them out.
- I know.

1640
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:11,033
- It's harder than giving out likes.
- Totally.

1641
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,601
[Eu-ddeum] Who do I give them to?

1642
01:06:12,668 --> 01:06:14,804
I think everyone will choose
to give dislikes

1643
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:18,374
either to people they really dislike
or who they see as a threat.

1644
01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:19,809

1645

CADDIEWANNY
GOLF YOUTUBER

1653
01:06:37,927 --> 01:06:40,796
- Hi!
- Hey there. Oh.

1654
01:06:40,863 --> 01:06:41,931
- Hello.
- Can I get a like?

1655
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:44,000
Me? All gone.

1656
01:06:44,066 --> 01:06:46,102
[Heheonni] I want to see your video.

1657
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:47,536
You give me a like?

1658
01:06:47,603 --> 01:06:50,773
- [Heheonni] I don't know yet.
- I'll send you a dislike if you don't.

1659
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,708
- Don't do that.
- I mean it, I'll send you one.

1660
01:06:52,775 --> 01:06:54,243
It's better to send one.

1661
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:56,379
- In order to be safe.
- Oh, come on!

1662
01:06:56,445 --> 01:06:57,546
Hurry and give me one.

1663
01:06:57,613 --> 01:06:59,648
I haven't decided. Let me think about it.

1664
01:06:59,715 --> 01:07:01,517
- Okay. I'll let you think about it.
- Don't worry about it.

1665
01:07:01,584 --> 01:07:02,818
I-I will, I will.

1666
01:07:02,885 --> 01:07:04,453
[Caddiewanny] This is how I'll do it,
I guess.

1667
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,322
[male influencer]
Yeah, this is what I have left.

1668
01:07:06,389 --> 01:07:08,457
- How many likes do you have left?
- I don't have any.

1669
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:10,259
- [Caddiewanny] I'll take one though.
- [Dickhunter] I'm not doing that.

1670
01:07:10,326 --> 01:07:12,862
- I'll give you a dislike if you don't.
- Dude! You can't do that!

1671
01:07:12,928 --> 01:07:15,331
Wow, this is how you play?

1672
01:07:15,398 --> 01:07:17,400
- You call that a good strategy?
- Hey, no, no. Hear me out, hyung.

1673
01:07:17,466 --> 01:07:19,168
I have no choice
but to give you a dislike.

1674
01:07:19,235 --> 01:07:20,469
Sorry, that's how I survive.

1675
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:23,105
- No. Wait. Wait up. Give me just a second.
- So hurry and give me a like.

1676
01:07:23,172 --> 01:07:25,207
- VVELY nim. Hello.
- Yes? Oh! Hello.

1677
01:07:25,274 --> 01:07:27,410
- VVELY nim, do you have likes?
- [VVELY] Yes, I do.

1678
01:07:27,476 --> 01:07:29,879
- Please give me one.
- [VVELY] Only if you give me one.

1679
01:07:29,945 --> 01:07:31,947
- I have none left.
- [VVELY] Then it won't work.

1680
01:07:32,014 --> 01:07:34,016
[Caddiewanny]
I'll send a dislike if you don't.

1681
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:36,685
- Is that a threat?
- [Caddiewanny] I'm sorry.

1682
01:07:36,752 --> 01:07:39,488
What's he doing?
"I'll send a dislike if you don't?"

1683
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:41,123
- Sorry, but I have no choice.
- Unni!

1684
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:43,692
[Caddiewanny] It's better for you
not to get a dislike, don't you think?

1685
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:46,562
Noona, do you still have likes?

1686
01:07:46,629 --> 01:07:48,330
- I do.
- I already used all mine.

1687
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:50,132
[Caddiewanny]
Can you please give me a like?

1688
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:52,368
- Noona, if you don't…
- [Eun-se] They're precious.

1689
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:53,669
…I'll give you a dislike.

1690
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:57,039
What a j…ewel.

1691
01:07:57,106 --> 01:07:58,340
[Caddiewanny] Right.

1692
01:07:58,407 --> 01:08:00,609
- Noona, do you have likes left?
- I have some.

1693
01:08:00,676 --> 01:08:02,378
- How many?
- Four.

1694
01:08:02,445 --> 01:08:03,379
Can I have one?

1695
01:08:03,446 --> 01:08:05,614
- How many do you have?
- I don't have any.

1696
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:07,883
- Sorry about that.
- I'm only going to exchange.

1697
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:10,486
Understood. Then I'm giving you
a dislike. Sorry.

1698
01:08:10,553 --> 01:08:11,821
- No, don't.
- I mean…

1699
01:08:11,887 --> 01:08:13,656
Okay, I didn't even do anything to you.

1700
01:08:13,722 --> 01:08:17,126
But you're giving me a dislike
just because I'm not giving you a like?

1701
01:08:17,193 --> 01:08:18,294
That's so unfair.

1702
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,196
Okay then, how about we exchange likes?

1703
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:21,964
What? You said
you didn't have any like left.

1704
01:08:22,031 --> 01:08:23,132
Actually, I have one left.

1705
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:25,000
Wait, what? He's messing with me.

1706
01:08:25,067 --> 01:08:27,002
- No, I'm not. No, I'm not.
- I hate when people do this.

1707
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:27,903
I was just joking.

1708
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:31,407
I don't know if it's because you're young
or you don't have much life experience,

1709
01:08:31,907 --> 01:08:33,809
but I think you just made a mistake.

1710
01:08:33,876 --> 01:08:36,979
"Then I'm gonna give you a dislike"
sounds like a threat to me.

1711
01:08:37,046 --> 01:08:38,914
Okay, I'm just going to leave now.

1712
01:08:38,981 --> 01:08:40,516
- Yeah. No, I don't need one.
- You owe her a like now.

1713
01:08:40,583 --> 01:08:41,417
Give me one too.

1714
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:43,953
YOU SENT CADDIEWANNY A DISLIKE

1715
01:08:44,019 --> 01:08:45,988
- [tense music]
- [Sherry] The guy in the blue sweater said

1716
01:08:46,055 --> 01:08:47,123
he'd give me a dislike

1717
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:48,858
- if I didn't give him a alike.
- [female influencer] What? Really?

1718
01:08:48,924 --> 01:08:51,760
[RISABAE] I think I saw him
saying that to other people too.

1719
01:08:51,827 --> 01:08:53,762
- [bbangthug] He threatened you?
- [Sherry] Yeah.

1720
01:08:53,829 --> 01:08:55,764
- [Seong-beom] That's crossing a line.
- [Sherry] Okay. What's his name?

1721
01:08:55,831 --> 01:08:57,099
[Seong-beom] Caddiewanny?

1722
01:08:57,166 --> 01:08:58,467
SHERRY SENT CADDIEWANNY A DISLIKE

1723
01:08:58,534 --> 01:09:01,070
- I just disliked him.
- Who?

1724
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:03,973
- That guy messing around.
- He basically threatened people.

1725
01:09:04,039 --> 01:09:04,874
Who was it?

1726
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:06,976
You can't just force people
to give you a like.

1727
01:09:07,042 --> 01:09:08,777
Can you do mine? I want to do it too.

1728
01:09:08,844 --> 01:09:11,514
I can't stand people
who are rude like him.

1729
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:12,615
IAMKATIECUTIE SENT
CADDIEWANNY A DISLIKE

1730
01:09:12,681 --> 01:09:14,850
- [Hyun-seo] Do you have likes?
- [Caddiewanny] I got a dislike.

1731
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:16,385
I shouldn't have been clowning.

1732
01:09:17,253 --> 01:09:18,754
What, another dislike?

1733
01:09:19,421 --> 01:09:20,356
Who is this?

1734
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:23,058
[chuckles] Shoot,
I just got another dislike!

1735
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:25,928
[groans] What do I do?

1736
01:09:26,529 --> 01:09:28,497
[DogJOY] Come here. Joy.

1737
01:09:29,398 --> 01:09:31,534
Come here. Let's go.

1738
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:35,971
[Yong-jin] The more I talked to people,

1739
01:09:36,038 --> 01:09:38,574
the more I thought
about the game strategy.

1740
01:09:38,641 --> 01:09:42,545
I think most people have
the same number of likes by now, 15.

1741
01:09:43,145 --> 01:09:45,114
The dislikes will make the deference.

1742
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:48,350
[Charming Jo]
Giving our dislikes to one person.

1743
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:50,419
So then, what you're thinking,

1744
01:09:51,387 --> 01:09:53,389
is they'll count
both the likes and dislikes?

1745
01:09:53,455 --> 01:09:55,491
- Offset by adding.
- [Charming Jo] Offset?

1746
01:09:58,260 --> 01:09:59,562
[Yong-jin] I thought about it.

1747
01:09:59,628 --> 01:10:02,097
But I didn't think
it would be easy to get likes

1748
01:10:02,164 --> 01:10:04,733
no matter how will you danced
or sang on stage.

1749
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:07,303
I realized it was a trigger.

1750
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:08,871
There's a twist,

1751
01:10:08,938 --> 01:10:12,174
and dislikes will play an important role
in winning Round One.

1752
01:10:12,241 --> 01:10:14,043
That's what I figured.

1753
01:10:16,278 --> 01:10:17,346
I'm going up.

1754
01:10:19,682 --> 01:10:21,817
[female influencer]
Yong-jin nim is going up.

1755
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:24,820
Ah, ah. Everyone!

1756
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:26,455
- Yeah!
- What's he doing on stage?

1757
01:10:26,522 --> 01:10:29,124
I'm not very good at singing
or dancing or anything like that,

1758
01:10:29,191 --> 01:10:32,895
but I am a good judge of character
and can read the room well.

1759
01:10:33,462 --> 01:10:34,830
- [male influencer] For sure.
- We know who you are.

1760
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:38,901
We're having a hard time deciding
who to give a like or dislike to, right?

1761
01:10:38,968 --> 01:10:40,135
Right!

1762
01:10:40,202 --> 01:10:42,538
Well, I've talked
with a lot of people here.

1763
01:10:42,605 --> 01:10:44,707
Jang Keun-suk nim said,

1764
01:10:45,341 --> 01:10:48,444
"TikTokers
and people making Instagram reels

1765
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:50,846
are highly overrated."

1766
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:53,649
"TikTokers
and people making Instagram reels

1767
01:10:53,716 --> 01:10:55,851
- are highly overrated."
- [tense music]

1768
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:57,753
Wow, that's so…

1769
01:10:57,820 --> 01:10:59,221
- What?
- I don't believe that.

1770
01:10:59,288 --> 01:11:01,323
[male influencer] Wow, he's doing that?

1771
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:03,659
He's obviously trying
to manipulate people.

1772
01:11:03,726 --> 01:11:05,761
If you don't believe what I'm saying,

1773
01:11:05,828 --> 01:11:08,130
go ahead ang give me a dislike.

1774
01:11:08,197 --> 01:11:09,465
And if you do believe me,

1775
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:12,668
please give Jang Keun-suk nim a dislike.

1776
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:15,671
I just thought, "What a psycho."

1777
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:18,207
[Keun-suk] I even opened a bottle for him.

1778
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:22,411
I thought, "Why is he being
so aggressive to me?" Then again…

1779
01:11:23,345 --> 01:11:24,413
I don't care.

1780
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:27,216
Whatever. I didn't say that anyway.

1781
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:29,118
Is he trolling for attention?

1782
01:11:29,184 --> 01:11:30,853
Thank you!

1783
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:32,521
- [female influencer] Was that it?
- [DaeDo] What was that?

1784
01:11:32,588 --> 01:11:35,491
Why is Jin Yong-jin pouncing
on Jang Keun-suk like that?

1785
01:11:35,557 --> 01:11:37,259
He's holding a bottle of alcohol.

1786
01:11:37,326 --> 01:11:38,927
[DaeDo] Oh, maybe he's drunk then.

1787
01:11:38,994 --> 01:11:41,230
He's a bad egg, that Jin Yong-jin nim.

1788
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:42,631
Who is that guy anyway?

1789
01:11:42,698 --> 01:11:43,832
[DaeDo] Jin Yong-jin nim.

1790
01:11:43,899 --> 01:11:46,368
His phone must be on fire right now.
[chuckles]

1791
01:11:46,435 --> 01:11:48,137
I have to give out dislike to someone.

1792
01:11:48,203 --> 01:11:49,972
[DaeDo]
I think a lot of people will give him…

1793
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:52,574
Do you think that he did this on purpose?

1794
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:54,209
YOU RECEIVED A DISLIKE

1795
01:11:54,276 --> 01:11:56,278
[chuckles]

1796
01:11:57,012 --> 01:11:59,648
YOU RECEIVED A DISLIKE

1797
01:12:00,849 --> 01:12:02,151
[Yong-jin] The point of the show

1798
01:12:02,217 --> 01:12:04,687
is to find out who's most qualified
to be an influencer.

1799
01:12:05,387 --> 01:12:09,124
I don't think it makes a difference
if you receive likes or dislikes.

1800
01:12:09,792 --> 01:12:12,394
It's ultimately about
getting people's attention.

1801
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:16,632
Since that's what it's all about,
either one is fine.

1802
01:12:17,232 --> 01:12:18,400
With the work I do,

1803
01:12:18,467 --> 01:12:22,304
I've had my fair share
of negative opinion and criticisms.

1804
01:12:22,371 --> 01:12:24,940
So dislikes don't phase me.

1805
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:28,010
You need to target the big guy
to be a successful troll,

1806
01:12:28,077 --> 01:12:30,913
and nitpicking them
or making petty criticisms

1807
01:12:31,547 --> 01:12:34,083
will ruffle feathers the best.

1808
01:12:34,149 --> 01:12:37,453
[Yong-jin] But on the other hand,
it was kind of a gamble.

1809
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:39,755
[tense string music]

1810
01:12:40,656 --> 01:12:42,124
[Sherry] TikTokers, gather around.

1811
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:44,526
[Sia_jiwoo] Well, that was upsetting.

1812
01:12:44,593 --> 01:12:46,328
He actually said "overrated"?

1813
01:12:46,395 --> 01:12:49,998
- [RISABAE] Everyone was surprised.
- [Sia_jiwoo] My heart is beating so fast.

1814
01:12:50,065 --> 01:12:52,134
- I mean…
- I think he's up to something.

1815
01:12:52,968 --> 01:12:54,470
What? Someone gave me a dislike.

1816
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:56,205
Really? You think it was Jin Yong-jin nim?

1817
01:12:56,271 --> 01:12:58,440
- Wait, another one.
- [CHAHONG] Oh, no.

1818
01:12:58,507 --> 01:12:59,475
[DaeDo] Why did he…

1819
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:02,344
- [CHAHONG] He threw him under the bus.
- [DaeDo] I know.

1820
01:13:02,411 --> 01:13:04,546
[Keun-suk] Something is definitely off.

1821
01:13:04,613 --> 01:13:07,850
There must be a reason that
Jin Yong-jin did that all of a sudden.

1822
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:10,386
I got so many dislikes since then.

1823
01:13:10,953 --> 01:13:16,191
So I thought, "This game might not be
entirely about getting just likes."

1824
01:13:16,258 --> 01:13:19,828
[Keun-suk] "Let's get people's attention
even if it's not positive."

1825
01:13:20,763 --> 01:13:22,097
[Eun-se] You gave me a like?

1826
01:13:22,865 --> 01:13:25,100
- Yeah, I think so.
- Are they gone?

1827
01:13:25,167 --> 01:13:26,135
Let me see.

1828
01:13:26,201 --> 01:13:27,703
- Do you have some?
- No, I don't.

1829
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:28,871
What about dislikes?

1830
01:13:28,937 --> 01:13:30,472
I do. I have 15.

1831
01:13:30,539 --> 01:13:31,707
Please give me one.

1832
01:13:31,774 --> 01:13:33,442
- [chuckles] Why?
- To go home.

1833
01:13:34,476 --> 01:13:36,779
- Seriously, please give me one.
- Okay, later…

1834
01:13:36,845 --> 01:13:38,781
I have a hard time giving them out.

1835
01:13:38,847 --> 01:13:40,082
I'll think about it.

1836
01:13:41,817 --> 01:13:44,019
Why not now? It's not hard.

1837
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:45,687
- You want to go home?
- Please give me one.

1838
01:13:45,754 --> 01:13:47,656
I don't think I can keep doing this.

1839
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:49,391
I want to go home.

1840
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:51,927
YOU SENT JANG KEUN-SUK A DISLIKE
YOU RECEIVED A DISLIKE

1841
01:13:53,896 --> 01:13:55,164
- Yong-jin.
- Yeah?

1842
01:13:55,764 --> 01:13:58,367
- You made your bid for victory.
- Right?

1843
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:00,369
I think it's all about attention.

1844
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:04,139
How much attention can you get
as an influencer. That's the point.

1845
01:14:04,206 --> 01:14:08,377
Oppa, do you mean it doesn't matter
whether they are likes or dislikes?

1846
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:10,779
That's what I think. It's a guess.

1847
01:14:10,846 --> 01:14:12,014
[sighs]

1848
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,816
Well, at least
the viewers will be entertained.

1849
01:14:13,882 --> 01:14:15,050
Did you get any?

1850
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:16,318
Me? I've got some dislikes.

1851
01:14:16,385 --> 01:14:18,954
I told you.
It's a loss if you go up there.

1852
01:14:19,021 --> 01:14:20,322
- Totally.
- No, I think…

1853
01:14:20,389 --> 01:14:22,424
- It happened to me.
- It's a loss.

1854
01:14:22,491 --> 01:14:24,326
People are already splitting up
into teams.

1855
01:14:24,393 --> 01:14:25,861
[male influencer] I just got some.

1856
01:14:25,928 --> 01:14:27,296
If you go up on stage,

1857
01:14:27,362 --> 01:14:29,298
- you'll be a target. What?
- [OKING] That's not it.

1858
01:14:30,098 --> 01:14:33,101
I don't think
this is about likes or dislikes.

1859
01:14:33,168 --> 01:14:34,436
It's the total.

1860
01:14:35,003 --> 01:14:36,338
Right, the more likes I get--

1861
01:14:36,405 --> 01:14:37,406
- [OKING] No, no, no.
- What?

1862
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:39,074
It's just about the number in total.

1863
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:40,476
Don't tell people that.

1864
01:14:40,542 --> 01:14:42,611
- They'll blame you if you're wrong.
- [OKING chuckles]

1865
01:14:42,678 --> 01:14:44,079
- That's fine.
- What number?

1866
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:46,482
- The one on our collar?
- [Yong-jin] It's not about that.

1867
01:14:47,182 --> 01:14:48,917
It's about getting attention.

1868
01:14:49,785 --> 01:14:51,386
[male influencer]
You're choosing somebody you don't want?

1869
01:14:51,453 --> 01:14:52,754
[Juice Seyeon] Hey, Oppa, Oppa.

1870
01:14:52,821 --> 01:14:57,125
I think there's something kind of weird
about Keun-suk nim asking for dislikes.

1871
01:14:57,192 --> 01:14:58,894
So, I bet there's a chance
they'll tally up

1872
01:14:58,961 --> 01:15:00,929
the total number of likes and dislikes.

1873
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:02,130
That's what I think.

1874
01:15:02,197 --> 01:15:04,132
- [Keun-suk] Did you receive dislike?
- [PaniBottle] No way.

1875
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:07,236
Look, there was no explanation
about likes and dislikes.

1876
01:15:07,302 --> 01:15:09,738
They never said there would be a penalty.

1877
01:15:09,805 --> 01:15:10,873
No mention.

1878
01:15:10,939 --> 01:15:12,841
They even used the word "attention."

1879
01:15:12,908 --> 01:15:14,076
They said we need to attract

1880
01:15:14,142 --> 01:15:16,111
- people's attention.
- But…

1881
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:19,081
- Right?
- People who don't get attention

1882
01:15:19,147 --> 01:15:20,916
- get eliminated.
- [Changhyun] Exactly.

1883
01:15:23,785 --> 01:15:25,420
It doesn't matter then.

1884
01:15:25,487 --> 01:15:26,922
That makes sense.

1885
01:15:29,591 --> 01:15:31,426
- We need dislikes?
- Yep.

1886
01:15:31,493 --> 01:15:32,361
[groans]

1887
01:15:32,427 --> 01:15:34,062
[Changhyun] We weren't thinking correctly.

1888
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:37,933
We shouldn't have given dislikes
to people we want to eliminate.

1889
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:39,501
Mistake.

1890
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:41,870
- Shit!
- [Changhyun] I think this is how it works.

1891
01:15:41,937 --> 01:15:43,939
[Yong-jin] No, we're not sure we're right.

1892
01:15:44,006 --> 01:15:45,674
- [Changhyun] I'm just saying.
- [OKING] We don't know.

1893
01:15:45,741 --> 01:15:46,842
[Changhyun] We're just guessing. A gamble.

1894
01:15:46,909 --> 01:15:48,877
Right. That's just
what I think is going on.

1895
01:15:51,346 --> 01:15:52,247
Makes sense.

1896
01:15:53,582 --> 01:15:57,019
I thought this game
was about not getting any dislikes.

1897
01:15:57,085 --> 01:15:58,720
I got some already.

1898
01:15:58,787 --> 01:16:01,490
So now I think I'll cast my dice.

1899
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:03,392
- Do you have dislikes?
- Mm.

1900
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:04,927
- [PaniBottle] Give me one.
- [DanceKang] Why? What's going on?

1901
01:16:04,993 --> 01:16:06,361
I'm not going to give you a dislike.

1902
01:16:06,428 --> 01:16:07,329
- I promise.
- Oh, okay.

1903
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:09,231
- Give me a dislike, please.
- Sure.

1904
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:11,266
[PaniBottle] Do you have dislikes?
Can I have one?

1905
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:12,167
Almost time.

1906
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:14,937
- Just one.
- Really?

1907
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:17,039
If this fails,

1908
01:16:17,105 --> 01:16:19,374
it means I don't have
what it takes for this game,

1909
01:16:19,441 --> 01:16:21,410
and going home makes sense.

1910
01:16:21,476 --> 01:16:24,079
If it succeeds, I played the game right.

1911
01:16:24,146 --> 01:16:26,615
No matter if it's likes or dislikes,

1912
01:16:26,682 --> 01:16:29,318
the most important thing
is people's attention.

1913
01:16:29,384 --> 01:16:30,953
But that's all or nothing.

1914
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:33,922
- Could you please give me a dislike?
- How come?

1915
01:16:33,989 --> 01:16:36,792
[Junghyun] They never said there would be
a penalty for getting dislikes.

1916
01:16:36,858 --> 01:16:38,594
That sounds like a gamble?

1917
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:40,262
[DanceKang] I've discovered a secret.

1918
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:43,131
Getting dislikes also helps
to advance to the next round.

1919
01:16:43,198 --> 01:16:44,499
- [female influencer 1] What?
- [female influencer 2] Ah, really?

1920
01:16:44,566 --> 01:16:45,968
[Seong-beom] No, that can't be right.

1921
01:16:46,668 --> 01:16:48,437
[Seong-beom]
We wanted to eliminate people.

1922
01:16:48,503 --> 01:16:50,872
No one will be happy
if those we gave dislikes to

1923
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:52,975
advance to the next round.

1924
01:16:53,041 --> 01:16:55,043
So I told people that I didn't agree.

1925
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:56,845
- Just waiting quietly.
- Stay humble.

1926
01:16:56,912 --> 01:16:58,547
- Seems like the best strategy.
- I agree.

1927
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:01,883
The first round is about
who is more qualified to be an influencer.

1928
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:03,251
[DaeDo] I'll go hunt for dislikes.

1929
01:17:03,318 --> 01:17:04,886
- You're really gonna do that?
- [DaeDo] Yes, I am.

1930
01:17:05,821 --> 01:17:07,289
I believe true influencers

1931
01:17:07,356 --> 01:17:09,658
should make a positive impact
on the world.

1932
01:17:09,725 --> 01:17:13,028
I won't admire someone
who's popular because of dislikes.

1933
01:17:13,095 --> 01:17:14,563
What's good about dislikes?

1934
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,632
Exactly, I think they're wrong.

1935
01:17:16,698 --> 01:17:19,267
[BBOGUMI] Instead of settling
for my small number of likes,

1936
01:17:19,334 --> 01:17:21,136
should I need to gamble and go for it?

1937
01:17:21,203 --> 01:17:22,170
[MyBoo] Let's try dislikes.

1938
01:17:22,237 --> 01:17:23,805
[bbangthug]
Why is everyone obsessed with dislikes?

1939
01:17:23,872 --> 01:17:25,407
[Japswa] What the hell is going on now?

1940
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:27,843
- [male influencer 1] I'll give it a try.
- [male influencer 2] Yeah, me too.

1941
01:17:27,909 --> 01:17:29,645
I'm not so sure how things are gonna work.

1942
01:17:29,711 --> 01:17:32,347
- Same here.
- [groans] This is nerve-wracking.

1943
01:17:32,414 --> 01:17:35,217
[host]
There are now ten minutes left to vote.

1944
01:17:35,283 --> 01:17:37,319
[dramatic music]

1945
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:41,056
[closing theme music]
