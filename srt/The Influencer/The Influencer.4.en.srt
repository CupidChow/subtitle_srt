1
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,679
[MyBoo] I'll use my VIP benefit.

2
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:14,581
I'll use my VIP benefit.

3
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:16,282
Huh? What was that?

4
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,118
What?
[laughs]

5
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:21,654
[host] MyBoo is using her VIP benefit.

6
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:23,556
- Good, huh?
- So tasty.

7
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:24,591
ROUND 2 VIPS
MYBOO, KEJIMIN

8
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:27,193
[host] Round 2 VIPs are granted

9
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:30,930
top priority when selecting a team member.

10
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:32,032
[KEJIMIN] Nice.

11
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:36,236
[host] MyBoo is using her VIP

12
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:38,004
team member selection priority.

13
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:40,373
- [influencers exclaiming]
- Seriously.

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,043
[suspenseful music]

15
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,814
I was like, "What's going on?"

16
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,850
[Keun-suk] Oh, my god,
life is truly like a TV drama.

17
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:52,786
[host] Using this priority

18
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:57,223
allows one to purchase a team member
by paying the starting bid in the auction.

19
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:02,896
Jang Keun-suk and MyBoo have become
a team through the VIP benefit.

20
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:05,131
Oh, my god!

21
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:07,967
[PaniBottle] That's brutal. A backstab.

22
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:09,903
"No matter how much you bid,

23
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:11,204
he's all mine."

24
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,505
The auction

25
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,608
was the biggest twist in this competition.

26
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:21,147
[MyBoo] Eun-ji was my first choice.
Second choice would be Jang Keun-suk.

27
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:23,483
But now the two of them
are going to be a team,

28
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,218
let's use my benefit.

29
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:28,855
[host] Pyo Eun-ji needs
to participate in the auction again.

30
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,057
The amount paid will be refunded.

31
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:32,559
[exclaiming]

32
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:33,693
Oh, you're getting the money back.

33
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:37,730
It would have been funny if nobody
could get their money back.

34
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:40,266
[laughs]

35
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:45,538
[cries]
No way!

36
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,707
Why is this happening to me?

37
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,244
Wait a minute,
why am I not getting any cash?

38
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:52,445
Three million won.

39
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:54,013
Right, I bought you at the lowest price.

40
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,915
VIPS CAN BUY THEIR PARTNERS
AT THE STARTING PRICE

41
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:57,183
[laughs]

42
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,419
[KEJIMIN] Only 3.7 million!

43
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:02,455
[DaeDo] I mean, who wouldn't buy him
at the lowest price.

44
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:03,923
[Changhyun] Bid now at a low, low price!

45
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,291
[Keun-suk] I'm a performer.

46
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:07,560
I'm fine. I'm fine.

47
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,363
[laughs]

48
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,264
11.33 MILLION WON > 15.10 MILLION WON
77.64 MILLION WON > 73.87 MILLION WON

49
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:14,000
Don't worry.
I somehow made it through anyway.

50
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,602
[MyBoo] It wasn't part of my plan

51
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:17,103
but Jang Keun-suk is famous.

52
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,406
He's active on Instagram
and has a lot of followers.

53
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,675
So I thought, why not give him a shot?

54
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:25,278
[groans]
This is shocking.

55
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,313
- An honor.
- Shall we?

56
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,116
[Ji-sou] You know what,
you look like animated characters.

57
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:31,484
[MyBoo] I like your outfit.

58
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:32,719
[KEJIMIN] They're so cute together.

59
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:34,387
[Ji-sou] Yeah,
it looks like they matched them.

60
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:39,092
[host] The next influencer is,
content creator, DaeDo.

61
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,059
[influencers cheer]

62
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:41,761
[Yong-jin] He's the OG creator.

63
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,297
I've been studying up
on photography and editing.

64
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:45,732
[exclaims]

65
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:49,602
10TH, DAEDO
FIRST-GEN GAMING YOUTUBER

66
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:53,106
[Changhyun] The person I least want
to team up with? It's DaeDo.

67
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,707
[OKING] I'm sorry to say this, but

68
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:59,012
I wanted to avoid teaming up with DaeDo
or those older guys as much as possible.

69
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:00,647
- [PaniBottle] Let's see.
- I have a feeling that DaeDo

70
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:01,748
might get eliminated.

71
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:03,383
[Junwoo] Yeah, I can't think
of anything I'd do with him.

72
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:04,317
[BBOGUMI] Mm-hm.

73
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,219
[DaeDo] I'm worried.

74
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:08,421
It's no secret to anyone here

75
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:11,191
that I'm in my 40s.
I can't keep up with young people.

76
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:13,493
[DaeDo] Taking photos isn't my thing.

77
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,595
[host]
We will now commence the auction.

78
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:28,474
[ominous music]

79
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:33,580
[DaeDo] Well, it was clear some of them
were avoiding eye contact with me.

80
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:35,014
I knew I was in trouble.

81
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:36,449
Is this the end for me?

82
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:39,152
Was this round meant
to eliminate people like me?

83
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,987
Um, so…

84
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:42,855
Buy me, RISABAE.

85
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:44,457
[DaeDo] I'll take excellent photos.

86
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,759
- [DaeDo] You'll look so good in them.
- [laughs]

87
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:48,127
Buy me, KEJIMIN!

88
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:49,195
[laughs]

89
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,598
[DaeDo] Pyo Eun-ji, buy me now!

90
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:53,399
[Eun-ji] What?

91
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:58,771
This is so awkward.

92
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:00,573
[exclaims]

93
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:02,475
[DaeDo] Okay.

94
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:05,311
Buy me! Why won't you?

95
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,413
Oh.

96
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:12,285
[Ji-sou] Oh, my god.

97
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:14,387
Five million.

98
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:17,890
[host] Dohwadore, has gone unsold.

99
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:19,359
15TH, DOHWADORE
FORTUNE TELLING YOUTUBER

100
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,794
[Keun-suk] No, I'm pretty sure that
at the end of all this…

101
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,730
I don't think there's anything
you can do here.

102
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,065
[Dohwadore] I had to rack my brain

103
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,700
'cause I knew if I just sat there,

104
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,702
I have the highest chance
of being eliminated,

105
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,805
I wanted to make it to Round 3,
otherwise, it wouldn't be fair.

106
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,208
[Dohwadore] Then I thought to myself,
"If I want to survive,

107
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,576
I had to buy someone."

108
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:37,744
Five million.

109
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,645
DOHWADORE
5.2-MILLION-WON BID

110
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,713
[host] Dohwadore, bids five million.

111
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,814
Dohwadore…

112
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:44,917
If Dohwadore wants to survive here…

113
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:46,486
- Yeah, that's true. You're right.
- He has to.

114
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:49,555
If you're unpopular, then buy someone
else who's unpopular

115
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,991
just to get here
which is what matters now.

116
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:55,128
[host]
The auction ends in three seconds.

117
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:56,829
[Changhyun] Really? Five million?

118
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:58,898
[host] Three, two, one.

119
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,234
That works.

120
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,070
[host]
DaeDo has been sold for 5.2 million.

121
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,938
- [RISABAE] Wow, that was smart.
- [BBOGUMI] Did you see that?

122
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:07,407
- Okay.
- Oh, okay.

123
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,608
That's what I was saying. That, that!

124
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:09,742
[MyBoo] I think he was right.

125
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,110
- He had to do that to survive.
- [Junwoo] What just happened?

126
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:13,046
- Yeah, that's exactly right, yeah.
- [MyBoo] It's true. He had to buy someone.

127
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:14,347
- [DaeDo sighs]
- Let's do this, hyung-nim.

128
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:15,682
Thank you.

129
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:17,317
- Yeah.
- [DaeDo] Thank you. Thank you.

130
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:19,552
- Oh, god.
- [exclaims]

131
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:23,189
He made the right decision.
If he hadn't bought me,

132
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,024
he would have been eliminated.

133
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:25,992
[DaeDo] Yo-hoo!

134
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,927
- [Juice Seyeon] Congrats!
- That was a smart move. Good job.

135
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,196
- That was smart. Good job, man.
- I know.

136
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,164
Seriously.

137
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,098
[DaeDo] Yeah, you did great.

138
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,833
- You must have used your brain, huh?
- Yeah.

139
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,368
- [Junwoo] Good job, man.
- Who knows who will be eliminated?

140
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:36,769
- [MyBoo] I know who will.
- I have no clue whatsoever.

141
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,171
[PaniBottle]
If I was sitting there right now,

142
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:40,039
- I'd feel so anxious.
- [BBOGUMI] Yeah, exactly.

143
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,874
Now, they're probably starting
to feel nervous.

144
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,242
[PaniBottle] I bet.

145
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:48,748
[host] The next influencer
is the influencer of influencers,

146
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,683
- [host] RISABAE.
- [Ji-sou] RISABAE.

147
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,984
9TH, RISABAE
FIRST-GEN BEAUTY YOUTUBER

148
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:54,020
- You guys. Please buy me.
- [laughs]

149
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:57,390
- Can you do sexy photos?
- Yeah, sure. I'm up for anything.

150
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:58,891
[Changhyun] What an item.

151
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,427
- I'll teach you how to pose.
- [Changhyun] Wow, I'm sold.

152
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:03,096
I really want to buy her.

153
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,898
[OKING] RISABAE.

154
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:09,135
Whether it's with make-up or photography,

155
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,337
she can use her skills
in many different ways.

156
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:16,109
[Yong-jin] I think my ideas are quite
compatible with the ones that RISABAE has.

157
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:19,112
I bet she'll definitely be able to grab
the audience's attention.

158
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:22,248
[Changhyun] After Dohwadore
took DaeDo, I started to think,

159
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:23,983
"Oh, no. I'm in trouble."

160
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,753
[Changhyun] I had to get RISABAE.
Let's do this.

161
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,955
I think… she's going to be popular.

162
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:29,956
She will for sure.

163
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:31,858
She creates feeds, doesn't she?

164
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:34,894
[PaniBottle] The last few must be
so anxious right now.

165
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:36,796
Please buy me.

166
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:39,866
[host] We will now begin
the auction for RISABAE.

167
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,101
Over here.

168
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,002
Five million.

169
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,437
5.5.

170
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:47,607
Seven million.

171
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:49,308
- [host] Jin Yong-jin bids…
- Seven million.

172
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,510
- … seven million.
- [Changhyun] Wow.

173
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,211
- [Changhyun] High baller.
- Seriously?

174
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,781
- [Changhyun] Seven point one.
- [Ji-sou] Oh, do it.

175
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:55,715
[Changhyun] Bring it on.

176
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:56,749
Eight.

177
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:58,217
Eight point one.

178
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:01,287
- 8.2.
- 8.3

179
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:03,623
Are we going to keep at this?

180
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,992
[laughs]

181
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:08,194
[tense music]

182
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,763
- 8.5.
- 8.6.

183
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,764
8.7.

184
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,499
- 8.8 million.
- [Yong-jin] Nine.

185
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,368
- [Changhyun] Nine point one.
- What is going on?

186
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,836
[OKING] This is nuts!

187
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,738
- Ten.
- Eleven.

188
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:21,374
- [laughs]
- [host] Changhyun bids 11 million won.

189
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:25,077
Can I get a loan, guys?
Who's giving me a loan?

190
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:27,513
Ji-sou, can you give me a loan?

191
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,415
[Yong-jin] Wow, things got this heated.

192
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:30,883
They're quite determined.

193
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,352
[Changhyun] I got to win. Going all in.

194
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:34,420
I need to survive this.

195
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:37,190
[host]
The auction will end in three seconds.

196
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:38,724
Three,

197
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,793
two,

198
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,129
- one.
- Twelve.

199
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,030
[Ji-sou] Really?

200
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:45,131
- [host] …one.
- [OKING] Twelve.

201
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,532
- [exclaims]
- [Ji-sou] Really?

202
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:47,967
Are you serious?

203
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:50,136
- Oh, no.
- [Yong-jin] Oh, what?

204
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,505
- What's going on here?
- [Eun-ji] You can't do that.

205
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:55,441
- Thirteen million.
- [host] Changhyun…

206
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,176
- You don't have that much money.
- [host] …13 million.

207
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,445
Hyung-nim, do you have that much? You do?

208
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,515
I thought we were on a similar boat.
How do you have so much?

209
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:05,251
[host]
The auction ends in three seconds.

210
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,720
- Thirteen?
- Yeah, 13.

211
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:09,622
- [host] Three…
- [exclaims]

212
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:10,857
- [host] …two…
- Expensive.

213
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:12,492
[host] …one.

214
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:13,626
[KEJIMIN] Wait! I'm going to use

215
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,728
- my VIP benefit.
- [Eun-ji] Oh, my goodness!

216
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:18,564
- Wait! I'm going to use my VIP benefits.
- Oh, my goodness!

217
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:19,932
[Eun-ji] This is crazy.

218
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,334
- KEJIMIN snatched her.
- [Dohwadore] Oh, wow.

219
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,035
That's why she was just sitting there.

220
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:26,973
[host] KEJIMIN has decided that
she will be using her VIP benefits.

221
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:27,874
VIP BENEFIT
RISABAE SOLD FOR 4.37 MILLION WON

222
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,275
I'm screwed.

223
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:33,112
[KEJIMIN] If I team up with RISABAE,

224
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,114
our synergy would be off the charts.

225
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,415
We're the perfect match.

226
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:40,686
Thank you for stepping in
and choosing me with confidence, KEJIMIN.

227
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,457
- [KEJIMIN] She's mine.
- [RISABAE] See you later.

228
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,392
RISABAE
BOUGHT BY A VIP

229
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,730
I was dumbstruck.

230
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,932
Together, we would have taken
the best picture,

231
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,667
but KEJIMIN swooped in
and took her.

232
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:57,136
So I had to start approaching
this like a psychological

233
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,337
and political battle.

234
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:00,673
Wow. If things go this way,

235
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,242
the person with the least amount of money
is going to end up losing.

236
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,378
- That's right.
- [Changhyun] Then they'll get eliminated.

237
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,650
WORTH RANKING
3RD: JANG JI-SOU

238
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,018
4TH: PYO EUN-JI

239
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:13,052
5TH: OKING

240
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,453
So now Jin Yong-jin
is the last one who's below me.

241
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,488
6TH: CHANGHYUN

242
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,489
Yeah.

243
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,190
7TH: JIN YONG-JIN

244
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:20,826
Yong-jin's the one with the least amount
of money right now.

245
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,328
- Is that a disadvantage?
- [PaniBottle] The other can just

246
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,696
- buy their way out of getting eliminated.
- [Juice Seyeon] That's true.

247
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:25,264
They're testing the waters too much.

248
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:26,499
Someone can still buy

249
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,800
- Jin Yong-jin though, right?
- Yeah!

250
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,268
- No, I don't think so.
- [BBOGUMI] I don't think they will.

251
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:32,104
His Instagram feed is a total disaster.
It's even worse than mine.

252
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:33,806
[laughs]

253
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:36,642
7TH, JIN YONG-JIN
YOUTUBER & DIRECTOR

254
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,744
Oh. So this is how it feels.

255
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:41,080
This is how it's going to be.
Think about it, guys.

256
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,081
If no one buys him…

257
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,216
- He'll be in trouble. Exactly.
- …he'll get eliminated. That'll be it.

258
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:46,085
- Because he has less cash?
- [Changhyun] Yeah, exactly.

259
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:47,920
You guys can afford me unlike him.

260
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,422
If he's sold, it's over.

261
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,926
It's possible no one will want me.

262
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,262
Teamwork has always been
my least favorite thing.

263
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,230
If you haven't figured it out already,

264
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:00,766
I always have trouble communicating
with other people.

265
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,735
[Yong-jin] So I thought
I might end up unsold.

266
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:07,340
[host] The auction for Jin Yong-jin
is now commencing.

267
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:08,674
STARTING BID
4.94 MILLION WON

268
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,019
Oh, come on.

269
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,392
I can't tell who's going
to get eliminated now.

270
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,628
Well, I think Jang Ji-sou is waiting

271
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:30,363
- so he can eventually buy Eun-ji.
- [DaeDo] Right.

272
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:31,664
Then she shouldn't buy anyone.

273
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:34,133
Because if she waits, then she's going
to end up getting more money.

274
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,502
[RISABAE] This seems like a fight
over who gets Eun-ji.

275
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,039
[host] 4.94 million.

276
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,508
Any willing participants in this round?

277
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,578
Huh?

278
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:47,480
You're joking?

279
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,448
Oh, come on, guys.

280
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:51,150
No one's biting.

281
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:52,918
Wow. That's harsh.

282
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:57,823
Looks like Yong-jin's giving up a bit.

283
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,092
He should have bought
someone earlier in the auction.

284
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,060
[DaeDo] Yeah.

285
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:04,130
[host]
The auction will end in three seconds.

286
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:05,431
Three,

287
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,332
two,

288
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:08,601
- one.
- [exclaims]

289
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,269
- [host] …one.
- [exclaims]

290
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,972
[upbeat music]

291
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,975
5.04.

292
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:19,078
[host] Pyo Eun-ji, 5.04.

293
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:20,479
Eun-ji didn't need to buy him.

294
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:22,648
- Yeah. She's just nervous.
- [PaniBottle] Yeah, just in case?

295
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:24,216
- Yeah, exactly, just in case.
- You think she's nervous.

296
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,719
Oh, shit. Hold on.

297
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:27,720
4TH IN WORTH
18.04 MILLION WON

298
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,790
[Eun-ji] Remember how I lost
Jang Keun-suk?

299
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,858
And I'm quite an impatient person.

300
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:36,462
I was anxious
because I couldn't buy anyone.

301
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,197
5.04.

302
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,331
Nice work!

303
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:43,002
I can highlight what you're good at
and even more, Pyo Eun-ji.

304
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,604
What's he even saying? I can't hear.

305
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,306
- That means he survives, right?
- Yeah.

306
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,808
[PaniBottle] 'Cause someone bought him.

307
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,077
[DaeDo] I think Changhyun should buy
Jin Yong-jin at any cost.

308
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,044
6TH IN WORTH
15.66 MILLION WON

309
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:54,647
This is going to majorly put
Changhyun in danger.

310
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,482
Yeah, I should be concerned. 5.04?

311
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,219
I can't really think of anything
to make a photo with Jin Yong-jin.

312
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:05,725
- 6.04.
- [Eun-ji] Are you kidding me?

313
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,259
You have to buy him.

314
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,862
- It's not the time to just sit around.
- [DaeDo] Right.

315
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,397
They'll be in trouble, otherwise.

316
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:14,767
That's right!
I'll make you an internet sensation.

317
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,869
I'll make you a sensation.

318
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,270
So what are you going to do?

319
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,106
I'm thinking.

320
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,675
7.04.

321
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,009
Nice, Eun-ji!

322
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,045
[Eun-ji laughs]

323
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:27,546
8.04.

324
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:29,215
[Yong-jin] That's excellent, OKING.

325
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:32,151
I promise, I'll make you
the best BJ in the business.

326
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,786
Broadcast Jockey.

327
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,821
Stop raising the price.

328
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:38,090
- [chuckles]
- [Eun-ji] I think it was a bit excessive

329
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:40,526
that OKING just decided
to raise the bid like that.

330
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,794
I made a bid for him

331
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:45,498
because I thought it'd be advantageous
to team up with someone famous.

332
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,367
[OKING] I thought my decision
was definitely worth it.

333
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,202
[Changhyun]
I tried to tell them not to buy him.

334
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,071
Be careful with your decisions.

335
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,506
[Changhyun] I even tried with Eun-ji

336
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:55,374
'cause I thought there was a chance
she'd pick me.

337
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,543
- [PaniBottle] This is nuts!
- [influencer 1] Wow, OKING.

338
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,311
[BBOGUMI]
I have no idea who's getting eliminated.

339
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:01,013
[RISABAE]
No one there deserves to go home.

340
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,914
[BBOGUMI] I know, right?

341
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:04,383
- 8.04.
- [Yong-jin] Huh?

342
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,085
Hey, you're being so mean.

343
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:08,587

347
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:16,562
All right. You used to be an accountant.

349
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,565
How'd you know about that?

350
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,367
I love well-educated women.

351
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:23,435
"I love well-educated women."

352
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:29,341
[host] Jin Yong-jin has been sold
to Pyo Eun-ji

353

354
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,746

I'm going to care of everything
from here on out.

357
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,052
- [laughs] Oh, really?
- I'll escort you.

358
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,187
Okay, let's go.

359
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,189
I don't know him at all.

360
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:45,457
I haven't talked to him much
since coming here.

361
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:48,160
[Yong-jin] I don't know Pyo Eun-ji
very well, but…

362
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,565
I'm pretty sure she's someone
who can elevate my strengths

363
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,834
and alleviate my weaknesses.

364
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,168
So how many people are left?

365
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,204
- Three people.
- [DaeDo] Oh.

366
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,104
So wild.

367
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,006
- So one of them is getting eliminated.
- [RISABAE] What? Huh?

368
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:02,341
Look at them.

369
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,543
You could cut the tension
between them with a knife.

370
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,612
- [MyBoo] Oh, no. Oh, no.
- [Dohwadore] It feels so tense right now.

371
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,247
[PaniBottle] I didn't see this coming.

Jang Ji-sou is safe,

376
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:21,260
Changhyun or OKING
is going to get eliminated.

377
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:23,929
[PaniBottle] Jang Ji-sou
has the most money so he can win.

378
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:26,131
[Yong-jin] I feel so bad for Changhyun.

379
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,234
Small difference, 200,000 won.

380
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,135
[DaeDo] It's a really
minuscule difference.

381
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:34,240
[Changhyun] If I could start a fight
between OKING and Ji-sou,

382
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:36,942
both of them would end up
being really pressured.

383
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,112
I could see they were trying
not to spend their money.

384
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,982
[Changhyun] So I kept reminding them,
I was the cheapest option.

385
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,783
[host] The next influencer

if you ask me to jump, I'll jump.
If you ask me to bark, I'll bark.

[Changhyun] Buy me.

391
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:57,463
If you do, I'll do something
to make it all worth it for you.

392
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:00,566
All right.
I'm counting on both of you guys.

[Changhyun sighs]

399
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,411
[Changhyun] I'll let you decide my fate.

400
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,017
[sighs]
I can't look.

401
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,554
Changhyun actually kneeled.

402
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:25,024
- [BBOGUMI] Aw, poor Changhyun.
- Oh, no. Look at him.

403
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,425
He seems so serious.

404
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,160
This is way too brutal.

405
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:34,066
I'll do what you want. I will serve you.

406
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,834
Please decide my fate.

407
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:38,671

408
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:41,407
Wait. So, uh…

409
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:42,908
[Ji-sou] Huh?

410
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:48,480
If you make a bid, then I have no choice
but to try and win this.

411
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:49,515
You know that, right?

412
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:52,284
[OKING] You see, if I make a bid here,

413
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:53,852
Jang Ji-sou has no choice

414
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,821
but to bid as well
to avoid being eliminated.

415
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:57,189
Then I'll end up losing.

416
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:58,724
[OKING] So I'm not going to bid.

417
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:00,426
Please, bid!

willing participants?

419
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,630
Come on!

00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,198
Stop kneeling, hyung-nim.

421
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:07,766
- I feel so terrible.
- Come on, hyung.

422
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,469
- Look at his ripped jeans.
- [MyBoo] Look at his sad face.

423
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:15,407
- [host] The auction is now closed.
- [exclaims]

424
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:19,278
Changhyun went unsold
as no one wanted to buy him.

425
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,648
[Changhyun] Looks like my time's up.

426
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,583
NO BID FOR CHANGHYUN

427
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,853
[PaniBottle] So this is how it went.
I wasn't expecting that.

429
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:36,962

00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,209
- You've got to bid on me…
- No way.

435
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:53,312
- …otherwise, this will be messed up.
- I won't do it. I won't do it!

436
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,313
When somebody bids,

437
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,482
- Jang Ji-sou is going to win it all.
- Yeah. That's right.

438
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:59,418
- The game is just going to be over then.
- [KEJIMIN] Gosh, I know.

00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:00,619
Oh, wow. What's going to happen?

440
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,388
[PaniBottle] I think
Changhyun hesitated too much.

441
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:04,890
He should try to make them spend
as much money as possible

442
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:05,958
by increasing the bid.

443
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,394
[Ji-sou] OKING,

444
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,896

[laughs]

447
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,171
[OKING] So if Ji-sou suddenly decides

448
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,139
to bid for Changhyun,

449
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,207
the game will be over
and I'll be done.

450
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:25,344

and I'm not going to let anything slide.

Oh, no, poor Changhyun.

[Ji-sou] I bought OKING
for five million won.

461
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:55,074
He didn't raise the bid,
he just left it.

462
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,942
- [Ji-sou] Let's do this.
- Congrats.

00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,312

- No, you're good. Take care.

[Changhyun] It was really upsetting to me.

00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,642
It hurts me.

475
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,878
I'll go back to normal now.

00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,947
I've started learning Japanese, actually.

00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:38,684
[Changhyun] I might be hosting
"Street Karaoke" overseas as well.

- I hope he didn't give it to me.
- [host] The worth is now

504
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:52,124
- PaniBottle's.
- Oh, jeez.

505
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,158
[MyBoo] What did you do?

506
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,127
- [DaeDo] Wait, what? Why you? Ridiculous.
- [RISABAE] Wait, what? Why?

507
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,395
PaniBottle. Were the two of you close?

508
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:58,197
- [RISABAE] Wait, what? Why?
- [Ji-sou] They're in the same cartel.

509
00:19:58,263 --> 00:19:59,531
How dare you take the worth of a dead man?

510
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:01,400
- How is this my fault?
- [DaeDo] He's a villain.

511
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:02,668
[influencer 2] This is unfair.

512
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:05,003
[PaniBottle] I have 25 million won now?

513
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,772
Good boost for us.

514
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:07,873
- Me and him.
- [BBOGUMI] You're right.

515
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,741
- We're a team now. That's right.
- [BBOGUMI] His soul lives on.

516
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:10,909
I have his soul with me.

517
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:13,745
[theme music]

518
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,925
THE INFLUENCER

519
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:31,430
[host] We will now begin
the Round 3 mission.

520
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:33,532
- [RISABAE laughs]
- [KEJIMIN] Oh, my goodness!

521
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,935
[host]
Round 3 is about showcasing your ability

522
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:38,904
to captivate the attention of others

523
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,839
through the creation of a photo feed.

524
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,143
The photo feed will be created
through a series of three games.

525
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,879
The first game lasts one hour.

526
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:48,780
[KEJIMIN] One hour?

527
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:52,718
[host] The second and third games
are both 30 minutes.

528
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:57,089
Each team is required to submit
one photo per game.

529
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:58,290
- Really?
- [DaeDo] Per game?

530
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,058
So it's just one photo.

531
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:04,296
[host] Each team can use seven sets
to take various photos.

532
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,898
The team that submits their photos first

533
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:10,636
can choose one out of nine slots
in the feed to upload their photo to,

534
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:13,238
preemptively securing their feed position.

535
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:16,441
- Oh, we're choosing a spot.
- I see, we're making the feed together.

536
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:18,243
[host] When completed, the feed will…

537
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,280
[exclaiming]

538
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:24,750
What… What?

539
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,054
[host] When completed,

540
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,823
a hundred judges will evaluate the feed.

541
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,359
[suspenseful music]

542
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,601
- [oohing]
- [influencers gasping]

543
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:43,935
That's so scary.

544
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:48,273
So, I had no idea that random people
were going to come in

545
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,542
and be the judges
of our photo feeds.

546
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:54,579
[Dohwadore] A photo of the judges appeared
and they were all dressed in black suits

547
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,114
and we couldn't see their expressions.

548
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:58,850
Are they AI?
Did they bring in a hundred AI judges?

549
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:00,919
That woke me up.

550
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,789
[host] The 100 judges
are composed of an equal ratio

551
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:07,092
of men and women
across various age groups.

552
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:10,095
- Oh, wow.
- In matching outfits.

553
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:14,933
[host] The judges will only be given
seven seconds to view the feed.

554
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,969
The longer a team
can capture the judges' attention

555
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:21,306
in each game,
the higher they will rank overall.

556
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:24,343
However, the team
whose feed captures the judges' attention

557
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:26,044
for the shortest amount of time

558
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:27,179
will be eliminated.

559
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:28,714
- Ooh.
- Wow.

560
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,148
So we really don't have that long.

561
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:33,018
We have to capture their attention quickly
or we're out.

562
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,953
[OKING] The scoring system was surprising,

563
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,222
we had a group
of completely random judges.

564
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:40,325
This actually seems
like the fairest way to go about it.

565
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:42,294
[host]
The worth of the eliminated team

566
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:46,264
will be divided and absorbed
by the members of the winning team.

567
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:51,136
We will now get started on the first game.

568
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,409
So, I believe the purpose

569
00:22:57,476 --> 00:23:00,679
is to catch people's attention
with just one photo, right?

570
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:03,915
[Keun-suk] This could be something
I'm either the weakest at,

571
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:04,950
or the strongest at.

572
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:07,886
I'm not experienced with photography.

573
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,154
It's not my strong suit.

574
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,655
[PaniBottle] I don't know
what will happen.

575
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,791
The most exceptional player?

576
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:13,759
That's me.

577
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,095
[MyBoo] Since cosplay photography
will stand out.

578
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:18,964
I'll just stick to my usual thing.

579
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,699
[Juice Seyeon] I'm pretty sure
I already know

580
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:22,000
what the public wants from me,

581
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,769
so I'm just going to do that.

582
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:26,838
[Yong-jin] Making YouTube thumbnails
is what I do every day.

583
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,040
Of course, I'm confident
about doing this mission.

584
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:30,675
I'm going to make a clean sweep.

585
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:34,613
[Junwoo] We just have
to make the photos stand out.

586
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,214
I've got props.

587
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:38,417
Do you think we should start
by shocking the audience?

588
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:40,452
[BBOGUMI]
But it's not about securing survival,

589
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,821
it's about being the last ones
to get eliminated.

590
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:44,823
[PaniBottle] So you're saying

591
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,558
- we shouldn't shock them upfront?
- Yeah.

592
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,127
[DaeDo] I don't think a lot of people
will be using special effects.

593
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:50,862
Since we have to wow them,

594
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,864
I want to make a photo
that leaves a strong impression.

595
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,966
So I formulated a bit of an idea here.

596
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:57,068
- [Dohwadore] I see.
- I'm going to use a few different apps.

597
00:23:57,903 --> 00:24:00,572
I took this chance
to learn all about photography

598
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,340
and photo editing as well.

599
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:04,843
I didn't take a break
while prepping for this round.

600
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:09,080
I was totally focused on studying.
Really. I promise you.

601
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:10,248
- [DaeDo] I've got it.
- [Dohwadore] Okay.

602
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:11,550
Glad to hear you have a plan.

603
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,151
[DaeDo] So don't worry about it.

604
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:15,053
- I don't think I'll be sent home.
- [Keun-suk] We should do one main photo.

605
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,354
- I'll make it to Round 4.
- [BBOGUMI] Oh, really?

606
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:18,123
[KEJIMIN] Since we teamed up,
we might as well win.

607
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,891
[Ji-sou] We'll be in first place.

608
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,727
[Yong-jin] You can rely on me.
I'm dominating this thing.

609
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:34,940
[host] The first game of Round 3
will begin now.

610
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:36,041
- [BBOGUMI] Wait, wait, wait, wait. What?
- [OKING] What?

611
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:37,509
[PaniBottle] Wait, it's starting now.
Come on, hurry!

612
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:38,577
[Juice Seyeon] Here we go!

613
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,647
[KEJIMIN]
Look, it's Barbie-themed in here!

614
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:46,418
3: BARBIE ROOM

615
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,220
[RISABAE] This is so pretty. Oh, my god!

616
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:50,655
[upbeat music]

617
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:56,528
[RISABAE] The quality is super nice!

618
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:58,029
- [KEJIMIN] Wow, this is so crazy.
- [RISABAE] I love it.

619
00:24:58,096 --> 00:24:59,764
One, two, three.

620
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:03,034
- Oh, my gosh!
- This is so pretty.

621
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:04,769
I seriously love this room so much.

622
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:11,510
- Wow! This is cool.
- Whoa!

623
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:16,882
2: CASH ROOM

624
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,953
The scale is amazing.

625
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,523
I thought the space
would be this tiny little spot

626
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:25,957
without a lot of finesse behind it.

627
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,293
But I was pleasantly surprised.

628
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,228
The set was so awesome.

629
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:32,764
[KEJIMIN]
Unni, you look good in front of this.

630
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:35,534
- [RISABAE] We should take a photo in here.
- Oh. All right, sounds good.

631
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:38,870
[KEJIMIN] Good.

632
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:40,772
[camera shutter clicks]

633
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:42,807
Hold that pose.

634
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,748
[RISABAE] Let me see it.

635
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:51,650
[KEJIMIN] Hey, that looks pretty good.

636
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,385
[RISABAE] This looks great.

637
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:56,521
[DaeDo] What is this place? This is crazy.

638
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,023
5: JUNGLE ROOM

639
00:25:58,089 --> 00:25:59,357
Oh, gosh.

640
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:06,197
[DaeDo] It was like stepping into a whole
different world in that room.

641
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:07,966
Wow, they did a wonderful job.

642
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,304
I was like,
"Dang, this whole thing is a joke."

643
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:15,507
Ah, luxury items.

644
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:19,010
1: LUXURY ROOM

645
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,214
[Juice Seyeon] Wow, I love this one.

646
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:27,752
- [Yong-jin] Next one.
- [Eun-ji] Six.

647
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:28,853
[Eun-ji screams]

648
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,022
Huh? What?

649
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,691
[Yong-jin] Wait, is this a murder scene?

650
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:37,228
6: ABANDONED ROOM

651
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,200
[Yong-jin] This must have cost a lot.

652
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:44,302
Wow!

653
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:49,174
- [Eun-ji] Awesome. Seriously awesome.
- [Yong-jin] This is so well made.

654
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,842
I should film a web series here.

655
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,612
[exclaims]

656
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:57,248
[Eun-ji] Oh, look at this!
There's even falling water.

657
00:26:57,315 --> 00:27:02,754
7: OIL ROOM

658
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:04,589
[Yong-jin] I'll wash my…

659
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,628
- Wait, what the heck?
- [Eun-ji] Huh?

660
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:11,563
- It's oil.
- What? Really?

661
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:13,832
- It's oil!
- [Yong-jin] Yeah, for real.

662
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:14,866
It's oil.

663
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:16,801
Ah, damn it.

664
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:20,138
Oh, god. I bet people are going to strip.

665
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:21,206
[Eun-ji] Oh.

666
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:23,875
Maybe I should've brought
more outfits for this.

667
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:25,176
[Yong-jin] It's so slimy.

668
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:27,545
Follow me.

669
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:29,581
If I'd known about this,
I would have picked Juice…

670
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:34,986
[KEJIMIN] Unni, we haven't checked
that room 1 yet.

671
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:37,155
- [KEJIMIN] Come on, come on.
- [Yong-jin] Let's take it slow.

672
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:38,390
[Eun-ji laughs]

673
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:40,158
Jeez, how come you're so relaxed?

674
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,293
No need to rush.

675
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,563
He was just incredibly laid back.

676
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:48,633
- [Yong-jin] Okay, uh… I got to think.
- [Eun-ji] So, I want to do…

677
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,001
Ugh, I don't know.

678
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:53,538
I was like,
"What's wrong with him? Is he drunk?"

679
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:55,206
He kept saying he wanted to drink.

680
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:56,741
[Yong-jin] I'd like a drink right now.

681
00:27:56,808 --> 00:28:00,478
Man, a shot of soju would probably
get my mind working a little better.

682
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:02,247
[Eun-ji] And he kept saying he was tired.

683
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:04,149
Dang, I'm too tired. Ugh…

684
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:08,019
[Eun-ji] What's up? Does he even care?

685
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:11,556
So, I felt a bit stressed out
and frustrated with him at first.

686
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:13,391
- [Yong-jin] Oh.
- [Eun-ji] Wow!

687
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,994
Oh, wait.

688
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:20,131
You know, we're not supposed
to take the props.

689
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,833
- Oh, we're not?
- [laughs]

690
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,769
Wow, all this fake money
is looking pretty expensive.

691
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,706
Oh, my goodness, Netflix.

692
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:28,807
[Eun-ji] Hey, come here.

693
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:30,909
- [alarm chimes]
- Oh!

694
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:33,778
[host] OKING and Jang Ji-sou

695
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:35,280
have submitted their first photo.

696
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:36,681
Wow, they're fast.

697
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,316
- Really?
- [RISABAE] What? Already?

698
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,384
- [RISABAE] Really?
- [KEJIMIN] Let's do this.

699
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:41,653
[MyBoo] How'd they do it so quick?

700
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:44,923
We were still planning
when they submitted the photo.

701
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:47,759
We had just finished looking
at all the rooms.

702
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,962
I think they're using a strategy.

703
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:54,632
They don't seem to care about the content,
but rather how to be the fastest.

704
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:59,270
[host] We will now get started
on the first game.

705
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:00,205
5 MINUTES AGO

706
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:01,673
- [Ji-sou] Come, follow me.
- [OKING] Wait, what?

707
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,241
[BBOGUMI] Look. Hurry, hurry.

708
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:05,043
[OKING] This one.

709
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:08,413
- [Ji-sou] Hyung, come here.
- [OKING] Okay.

710
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,082
- [Ji-sou] Should we do it here?
- [OKING] Let's do it.

711
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:11,983
Go.

712
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:14,619
- Wait, they've locked the door!
- Oh, my.

713
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:15,620
- Who's in there?
- Oh, no.

714
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:17,655
- Take it now?
- [OKING] Yeah.

715
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:19,991
[Ji-sou] I don't know
if it will work with the smoke.

716
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:23,294
[chuckles]

717
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:26,364
There are nine slots in the feed.

718
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,634
I figured most of the focus
will be on the center.

719
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:33,538
Our main goal was to snap a picture
as fast as we possibly could.

720
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:37,709
I thought with no props or equipment,
then what is a sure-fire way

721
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:41,179
for us to stand out amongst
the other six teams of competitors?

722
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:44,616
[Ji-sou] I'll take it.
How about it's a photo of your face?

723
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:46,284
[OKING]
I was actually thinking the same thing.

724
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:47,285
[Ji-sou] In the center of the feed.

725
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:49,120
Since you're the more famous one
compared to me.

726
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:51,656
If we put your face in the middle,
people are going to recognize.

727
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:52,924
- [OKING] Makes a lot of sense.
- [Ji-sou] Right?

728
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,496
[comical music]

729
00:29:58,563 --> 00:29:59,831
[camera shutter clicks]

730
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:01,733
[laughs]

731
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,701
[OKING] Hey, hey, hey. Hold on.
One more time.

732
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:10,108
- [Ji-sou] Let's check out the other rooms.
- [OKING] Okay, okay.

733
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:12,677
[KEJIMIN] Unni, room one!

734
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:13,645
[Ji-sou] Oh, this one.

735
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:14,546
4: MIRROR ROOM

736
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,682
- [OKING] Ours.
- [BBOGUMI] Uh…

737
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:22,086
[Ji-sou] Okay, perfect.
[laughs]

738
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,521
Let's pick one and submit it.

739
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:26,057
- [OKING] Okay.
- [Ji-sou] Yeah, one.

740
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:28,560
- [Ji-sou] And two.
- [OKING] The second one.

741
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:30,295
- [Ji-sou] This one?
- [OKING] Yeah, two is better.

742
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:32,564
I think people will click on it
'cause you're making a funny face.

743
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,465
[Ji-sou]
I'm going to edit it a little bit.

744
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,435
[OKING] Do you think
this is going to work?

745
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,803
As long as we don't get eliminated.

746
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,471
- [Ji-sou] True.
- [OKING] Yeah.

747
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:41,873
- [Ji-sou] Submitted.
- [OKING] Let's go.

748
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,810
[host] OKING and Jang Ji-sou
have submitted their first photo.

749
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:48,179
Please select your feed position.

750
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:49,247
[OKING] Five, please.

751
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:51,249
We'd like number five.

752
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:52,283
[Ji-sou] Imagine your face

753
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,985
- right in the center of it.
- Yeah, right there. Nice.

754
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:56,721
- Yes.
- Oh, yeah.

755
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:57,655
OKING
JANG JI-SOU

756
00:30:57,722 --> 00:31:00,191
[Yong-jin] I bet Jang Ji-sou
is aiming for the middle slot.

757
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:01,259
[Eun-ji] Aah.

758
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:04,062
[BBOGUMI] I don't understand
how they submitted that photo so quickly.

759
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:05,163
That's nuts.

760
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,298
[PaniBottle] They have a lot
of tricks up their sleeves.

761
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,900
So we're going to have
to play it straight.

762
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:10,501
Oh, there's a couch here too.

763
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,172
I brought some wigs with me.

764
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:15,506
Oh, nice.

765
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:18,343
Do I look cute?

766
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,612
- Hmm?
- Do I look cute?

767
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:23,448
I don't know. Maybe add some more.

768
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:25,149
- Oh.
- [PaniBottle chuckles]

769
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,851
I'll show you later then.

770
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:30,088
[BBOGUMI] You know, I wonder
what the other teams are doing?

771
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:32,023
We've got to think outside the box.

772
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:35,059
[suspenseful music]

773
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,432
So, since all the stylish rooms are taken,

774
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:44,135
then that's not something
I can rely on in this first round.

775
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,471
[BBOGUMI] Not to mention,
it's me and PaniBottle,

776
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:48,339
so we got to make it funny.

777
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:51,676
We've got to make people crack up
no matter what we do.

778
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:55,346
[BBOGUMI] I was thinking I could cosplay
as a Khitan or something funny like that.

779
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,548
- I love that idea. Yeah.
- [BBOGUMI] Really?

780
00:31:57,615 --> 00:31:59,984
[BBOGUMI] I could also cosplay
as Gongsil and J.Y. Park.

781
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:00,985
It's up to you.

782
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:03,087
- [BBOGUMI] This looks weird.
- Here, let me hold it.

783
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:04,389
[PaniBottle] This should work.

784
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,591
Is it locked?

785
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:09,127
Oh, sorry.

786
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:10,862
My bad. What's going on?

787
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,363
Do you guys want to use this room?

788
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,198
- Let me know if you do.
- It's a horror theme, isn't it?

789
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,934
- See you later.
- [Yong-jin] Man, this is kind of tricky.

790
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,702
- [Eun-ji] Weird vibes.
- [Yong-jin] Tough competition.

791
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,737
Is my face tough competition?

792
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:22,473
[PaniBottle]
'Cause you've committed to the make-up.

793
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,509
[BBOGUMI] Do I look like J.Y. Park?

794
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:26,010
No, but it's funny.

795
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:28,012
- I look like a middle-aged woman.
- Exactly.

796
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,981
[PaniBottle] This feels like prepping
for an art school exam.

797
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:31,983
- [BBOGUMI] I went to art school.
- [PaniBottle] Oh, so did I.

798
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,318
- Yeah, what major?
- Design.

799
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:34,953
- [BBOGUMI] I studied industrial design.
- [PaniBottle] Mm.

800
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,821
- Visual Design.
- Ooh.

801
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:39,057
This is how art is, you know.

802
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,458
- [BBOGUMI] Yeah.
- It's better if one of us…

803
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:41,492
- [BBOGUMI] Yeah.
- …is the supporting role

804
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,695
rather than both of us
being the main focus.

805
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:45,163
- [BBOGUMI] Mm.
- [PaniBottle] I'll be holding this.

806
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:46,331
[PaniBottle] You stand here.

807
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:49,734
I'll be behind you holding
that fire extinguisher like a saxophone.

808
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:50,702
Here.

809
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:53,037
Since we both studied art,

810
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:55,006
even with a funny idea,

811
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:57,408
we have to make sure
the composition looks great.

812
00:32:58,009 --> 00:32:59,577
Since I was a design major,

813
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,013
I'm definitely thinking
about that kind of stuff.

814
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,383
[BBOGUMI] So I focus a lot on composition.

815
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:06,417
Two is enough?

816
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:12,090
- I think so. All looks good.
- [PaniBottle] Okay, cool. Mm.

817
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,858
[BBOGUMI] Is this good? Let me see.

818
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:15,593
You look ugly!

819
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:17,462
Hurry up.

820
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:19,364
- [BBOGUMI] Add this mustache? Here.
- [PaniBottle] Yeah, okay.

821
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:23,234
[PaniBottle] People might think
we're too ugly.

822
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:25,303
You're already ugly, so it's okay.

823
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,738
[PaniBottle] It'll be fine
if I don't look bad.

824
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:28,873
[BBOGUMI] Well,
you already look bad, so it's fine.

825
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:29,874
[laughs]

826
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:31,676
You look fine.

827
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:33,578
- What do I do?
- I don't think it's going to be visible.

828
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:34,912
- Okay.
- [BBOGUMI] Shit.

829
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:37,749
If you can't even do this,
how are you ever going to get married?

830
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:39,083
- [PaniBottle] Well, I'm not married.
- Oh.

831
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,219
- How old are you?
- [PaniBottle] Thirty-eight and single.

832
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:42,987
Darn it, I can't do it either.

833
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:45,023
- [PaniBottle] Oh, if you can't do it…
- [BBOGUMI] Oh, got it.

834
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:46,924
…then how are you ever
going to get married?

835
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:48,726
- I did it. Okay.
- Okay.

836
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:49,861
I can get married now.

837
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:53,064
Who the hell's going to marry you?
[chuckles]

838
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:54,098
[PaniBottle] Hold.

839
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:58,870
[vocalizing]

840
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:03,274
[camera shutter clicks]

841
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,446
- [PaniBottle] It's a piano.
- [BBOGUMI] It does look like one.

842
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:10,681
[upbeat music]

843
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:16,354
- Ooh, okay nice.
- Mm.

844
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:20,425
Do you want to do a wild child concept?

845
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:22,260
[Eun-ji laughs]

846
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:23,928
[Eun-ji] A wild child, really?

847
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:25,430
Yeah, you want to do that?

848
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:27,799
Actually, I'll take this off.

849
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:29,967
What happens then?

850
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:32,437
- Well, let's see.
- [Yong-jin] Mm.

851
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:37,241
- [Eun-ji] Under this…
- Whoa! What are you doing?

852
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:38,943
Hold on. Why don't you turn around,

853
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,945
take it off,
and then you can show.

854
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:43,748
[Eun-ji] Under is this top.
Do you like it?

855
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:46,217
[Eun-ji] Under is this top.
Do you like it?

856
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:49,320
- Huh?
- [both laughing]

857
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:51,322
It's better like this, right?

858
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:53,524
Well, yeah, I think so.

859
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:56,427
But, uh…

860
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:57,328
This is…

861
00:34:58,029 --> 00:34:58,963
Like this?

862
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,033
But the mic's kind of…

863
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:05,269
[Eun-ji] Okay, there.

864
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,341
Do I look good?

865
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:13,010
- Yeah.
- [Eun-ji laughs]

866
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:15,947
[Yong-jin] I'll do it.

867
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:17,682
The picture should fill the whole screen.

868
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:19,117
- Hold still.
- Okay.

869
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:21,185
[Yong-jin] Yeah, great.

870
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:24,222
Oh, my. Oh, wow.

871
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,289
[Yong-jin] Yes.

872
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,792
- Oh, my. Great.
- [camera shutter clicks]

873
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:30,261
Oh, my. Perfect.

874
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:32,530
Oh, wow.

875
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:35,500
[Keun-suk] Closer.

876
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,404
[camera shutter clicks]

877
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,675
Okay, step back a bit.

878
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:49,213
[Keun-suk] I didn't want to do
something too cliché.

879
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,584
So I thought about what I could do
differently from the other competitors.

880
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:57,488
In the end, mixing both cliché
and less cliché stuff

881
00:35:57,555 --> 00:35:59,524
would be a pretty
unique approach.

882
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:02,426
[Keun-suk] It will make
the most sense in this challenge

883
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,962
to milk my fame for all it's worth.

884
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:08,266
Do you know those Instagram posts
with captions like,

885
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,233
"It's going viral."

886
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,370
"Or the situation
with Jang Keun-suk's Instagram is…"

887
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:13,838
[Keun-suk] You know what I mean?

888
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:17,074
What do you think about us
taking a normal couple photo,

889
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:19,143
and adding a caption like,
"Girlfriend reveal."

890
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:21,045
I think that's a good idea.

891
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:26,951
I thought it was important that I create

892
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:31,522
a caption that catches people's attention
and make them say, "Wait a minute." "Huh?"

893
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:34,659
When they look at my feed,
along with an image of me,

894
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:37,895
Jang Keun-suk, it could create
some synergy between us.

895
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:41,532
[Keun-suk] Using captions such as
"Jang Keun-suk's girlfriend"

896
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,035
would give us
a much better chance of winning.

897
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:47,071
Since it was more of a risk for Keun-suk,

898
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:48,673
I was fine with the idea.

899
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:52,610
I mean, it's a concept that I wouldn't
really ask to do in the first place.

900
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:54,979
Okay.

901
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,382
- I'll do it the way I mentioned.
- [MyBoo] Okay.

902
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:01,018
[Keun-suk]
Man, it's a race against the clock.

903
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:02,620
We got to secure a good slot.

904
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:18,102
JANG KEUN-SUK'S GOING VIRAL
FOR THE LEAKED PHOTO OF HIS GF

905
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,273
[Keun-suk] With our photo,
it fills the whole screen

906
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:25,843
but when it's on the feed,
then it's in one of those nine squares.

907
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,045
So I wanted to make the text bigger,

908
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:30,715
and still ensure my face was recognized.

909
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:32,183
That's why we zoomed in so much.

910
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:34,919
[Keun-suk] It looks like this.

911
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:36,587
What do you think?

912
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:38,723
We should edit it, right?

913
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:40,825
- The photo doesn't matter. This does.
- Oh, okay.

914
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:42,760
It'll be on a small screen
so nobody will see it.

915
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:44,462
- Okay.
- It'll be super zoomed in

916
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:46,397
and then,
we'll use the text as our crutch.

917
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:51,235
[MyBoo] I've actually
never been in this situation before

918
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:53,037
where I put text on a photo.

919
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,305
Adding text to a photo?

920
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:56,741
To just one photo?

921
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:58,909
[MyBoo] I thought,
"Is this really going to work?"

922
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:00,878
Doesn't look bad.

923
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,013
Well, it's for the first game,

924
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,948
- so I think it's okay.
- We'll give it a shot.

925
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:05,716
- Okay.
- [chuckles]

926
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:08,953
[host] Team MyBoo and Jang Keun-suk

927
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,888
has submitted their photo.

928
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:11,789
That was fast.

929
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:14,492
[Keun-suk] I think there's only one team
ahead of us, right?

930
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:15,693
[MyBoo] I think so.

931
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:18,429
- [groans]
- [MyBoo] Did they take the middle?

932
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:20,097
- [Ji-sou] They're back.
- [MyBoo] How did you submit

933
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:22,867
- your pictures so quickly?
- [OKING] Good job, guys.

934
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:24,969
[Keun-suk] Number four.

935
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:25,936
MYBOO
JANG KEUN-SUK

936
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:27,305
[MyBoo] It's done.

937
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:30,908
I've been thinking, those photo sets
are kind of like traps.

938
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,678
They don't mean anything.

939
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:36,380
- [DaeDo] I want to…
- [Dohwadore] Okay.

940
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:38,783
- …take photos in all the rooms…
- Mm.

941
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:39,917
[gasps]

942
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:41,986
…in the same pose.

943
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,022
Where we take them
is also really important.

944
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:48,959
[Dohwadore] He wanted
to approach this artistically

945
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:52,063
and that was the exact
opposite thought from what I had.

946
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:54,799
[Dohwadore] I think we should do things
that make people curious.

947
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:56,701
- Mm-hm.
- I think it's important.

948
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:58,769
We could use fortune-telling to hook them.

949
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:01,205
Or at least do something
that piques their curiosity

950
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:03,474
- or makes them go, "Huh?"
- Mm… Mm.

951
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:06,143
I figure using DaeDo's fame

952
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,779
would be smart
since he's more famous than me.

953
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,916
For example, we could snap a picture
of me reading his fortune

954
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:15,386
and caption it something like,
"DaeDo's Love Fortune."

955
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,788
We could make it like a thumbnail.

956
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:20,591
My fortune only affects me.

957
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:22,360
I don't think other people would care.

958
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:24,095
I thought…
I don't think this is going to work.

959
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:25,896
I think we would be in trouble.

960
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:28,666
What am I looking for
is kind of like this.

961
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:31,268
- [classical music]
- [gasps]

962
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:35,206
[DaeDo] Do you see what I mean?

963
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:37,007
- I want to do this with a person.
- [Dohwadore] Okay.

964
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:39,844
Mm. I think it's a good idea.

965
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:42,980
For the first game,
we tried to take pictures

966
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,849
of all seven rooms as much as possible.

967
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:48,419
And put all seven pictures together
into one photo.

968
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:50,621
[DaeDo] Then I was going to edit them

969
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:55,826
somewhat like a stained glass window,
with money, luxury goods, pink room.

970
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,596
These rooms are influencer material.

971
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:02,700
I think I was hoping for people to see
some sort of desire or passion there.

972
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,670
I wanted them to see
the more creative side of us influencers.

973
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,072
Uh…

974
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:13,677
Well, from DaeDo's point of view,
it's like I kidnapped him

975
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:14,712
onto my team, right?

976
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:17,448
Because teaming up with me
wasn't part of his plan,

977
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:21,118
I didn't feel comfortable asking him
to do things my way at all.

978
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:22,853
So, I decided to let him take the lead

979
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,189
as much as possible for the first game.

980
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,424
[DaeDo] This should be good…

981
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:28,025
like that.

982
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:32,963
I need a handbag, go get the big one
in the middle over there.

983
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,299
- [DaeDo] Yeah. The big one.
- This one over here?

984
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:36,300
[DaeDo] Forward more.

985
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:41,372
Even closer. Can you hold it, please?

986
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,007
[DaeDo] The lighting isn't right.

987
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:45,576
Well, actually,
I have extra lights out there.

988
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:46,610
[Dohwadore] Okay, yeah.

989
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:49,213
[orchestral music]

990
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:56,587
- Are these them?
- Yes.

991
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:57,888
- [Dohwadore] I'll hold it.
- [DaeDo] Yes, please.

992
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,257
- If you can hold it from here, this side.
- Okay.

993
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:01,759
- Okay.
- Yeah, from the side.

994
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:05,229
[DaeDo] This is pissing me off.
[groans]

995
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:08,098
This side. Can you do it from this side?

996
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:09,266
- Like this?
- Yes, good.

997
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,936
[DaeDo] I'm not sure
if this will work. But…

998
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:14,905
You've got to shine it from up above. Yes.

999
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,373
[DaeDo] Nice.

1000
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,508
Let's see.

1001
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,245
[DaeDo] Which angle would make the shot

1002
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:24,949
look the most beautiful
and how I can really make it stand out.

1003
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:26,584
One, two, three.

1004
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,652
[camera shutter clicks]

1005
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,589
No, you have to throw it
from bottom to top.

1006
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:32,923
- [Dohwadore] Oh, I got it.
- [DaeDo] Yeah.

1007
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:35,559
Creativity, creativity, creativity.

1008
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:38,529
[DaeDo] We need to show what it's like
to be an influencer.

1009
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:41,065
- [orchestral music continues]
- [camera shutter clicks]

1010
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:43,968
It was classy. I loved it.

1011
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:46,504
- [Dohwadore] Okay.
- [DaeDo] Nice.

1012
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:48,439
Time left?

1013
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,909
- We have 36 minutes left.
- Thirty-six? That works.

1014
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:55,613
- [Yong-jin] They'll all take fancy photos.
- [Eun-ji] Hmm.

1015
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,048
We have pretty girls like Juice Seyeon

1016
00:41:58,115 --> 00:41:59,717
and they're bound to be half-naked

1017
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:01,285
- and probably use this room.
- Right.

1018
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,920
[Yong-jin] Thinking about it from a basic,

1019
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:04,788
- lizard-brain perspective.
- Yeah.

1020
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,524
I think we take a nice picture

1021
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,993
and then casually place
a single strand of hair there.

1022
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:10,794
They'll click.

1023
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:13,531
- [Yong-jin] Hair.
- Seriously?

1024
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:15,566
[Yong-jin] You know what I mean?

1025
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:19,470
So, people would look at it and be like,
"Is this a crack?"

1026
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,105
Just think about it like this,

1027
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:23,607
it's about capturing
people's attention, right?

1028
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:27,244
[Yong-jin] If you look at your screen,

1029
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:29,380
and see a scratch or a hair stuck on it,

1030
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:30,915
people usually go, "What's this?",

1031
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:32,850
like, "Is this actually on my screen?"

1032
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:35,319
And they'll even try to touch it.

1033
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:39,990
We'll breeze through the first round
'cause nobody else has this idea.

1034
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:42,593
How exactly do you plan
to shoot that then?

1035
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:46,597
PNG. We'll take a photo
and add a PNG file to it.

1036
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:47,631
[Eun-ji] A PNG of hair?

1037
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:49,333
Or something that looks like
a cracked screen.

1038
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,538
[Eun-ji] Is this going to work?

1039
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:56,774
Should I just play along with this idea?

1040
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,642
I'm not very adventurous.

1041
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:01,378
If I was paired up
with someone else in this challenge,

1042
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:03,447
I probably would've just played it safe.

1043
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:05,282
[Eun-ji] It was a big risk for me.

1044
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:10,387
I'll leave figuring out the details
of the photos to you, Pyo Eun-ji.

1045
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:11,889
You're more of an expert than I am.

1046
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:14,358
[light music]

1047
00:43:21,899 --> 00:43:24,501
- How's this?
- Yeah. I think right about here.

1048
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:26,704
Then how will you add it?

1049
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,640
[Eun-ji] This style only works if you want
to put photos together like this.

1050
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:30,608
You see?

1051
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:32,776
[Yong-jin] I know it'll work. Trust me.

1052
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,245
[Eun-ji] Wait, I'm not sure
what to do from here.

1053
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:39,783
"PNG on a cellphone."

1054
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:43,287
HOW TO CONVERT IMAGE
TO PNG ON YOUR PHONE

1055
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:46,190
[Eun-ji blows air]
No, that's not it.

1056
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:49,193
Hey, can you give me the PNG file?

1057
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:50,127
Yeah, hold on.

1058
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:51,395
I just sent it.

1059
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:55,199
[Yong-jin] No, wait a sec. Yeah.
Yeah, that's the one.

1060
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:58,669
It's not showing up.
These are from the app.

1061
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:00,471
Uh…

1062
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:04,375
[sighs angrily]
It won't work.

1063
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:06,744
[tense music]

1064
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:12,549
There wasn't obvious conflict,
but a lot was going on internally.

1065
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:15,352
[Eun-ji] You know, he's someone
with tons of ideas,

1066
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:17,621
but he always leaves
the execution to everyone else.

1067
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:20,791
So I ended up having to do the work
even though I didn't know how to do it.

1068
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:23,927
Why doesn't he try
to figure it out for himself?

1069
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,764
[sighs angrily]
It won't work.

1070
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:29,366
[Eun-ji] No access?

1071
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:33,570
Oh, wait. Just a sec.

1072
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:35,406
- [Yong-jin] What a bummer.
- [Eun-ji] I think it worked.

1073
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:36,640
Did it?

1074
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:38,809
- Wait…
- We are pulling through on the idea!

1075
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:42,780
[Eun-ji] Look, it worked.

1076
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:44,448
You see? I told you.

1077
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:46,650
- [Eun-ji] But this…
- [Yong-jin] You should make it bigger.

1078
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:47,818
Here like this.

1079
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:50,087
[Yong-jin] Yeah, just like that.

1080
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:53,557
You've got to let go of this idea
that you have to look pretty all the time.

1081
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:54,525
Let's submit it.

1082
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:56,393
- [Eun-ji] Okay, this one?
- [Yong-jin] Yeah, I like it.

1083
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,030
Oh, my god. If I get eliminated,
then you are the sole reason

1084
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:01,198
for it happening.

1085
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:02,933
- Well, at least, you know…
- But…

1086
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,269
- …even if we do get eliminated…
- Okay.

1087
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:07,371
…then at least we go out in style.

1088
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:08,639
I don't think so.

1089
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,307
No, that's what really matters here.

1090
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,742
- Pretty pictures don't matter.
- [Eun-ji] Oh, please!

1091
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:13,310
Tell me you're confident
that we won't get eliminated.

1092
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:16,547
I'm telling you,
nobody else has our idea here.

1093
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:18,749
- [Eun-ji] Should I really trust you?
- You've got to hear me out on this.

1094
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:19,950
- [Eun-ji] Okay.
- [Yong-jin] First of all,

1095
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:22,152
this is a very big experience
in your life, Eun-ji.

1096
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,654
You drive me insane.

1097
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,022
You've got to go the extra mile.

1098
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:26,190
Go for it.

1099
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:31,462
[host] Team Jin Yong-jin
and Pyo Eun-ji has submitted their photo.

1100
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:32,696
JIN YONG-JIN
PYO EUN-JI

1101
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:34,465
[Dohwadore screams]

1102
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:36,166
[DaeDo] No, like this. Ah!

1103
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,301
Okay, great.

1104
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:38,969
One, two, three.

1105
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:42,172
- [screaming continues]
- [camera shutter clicks]

1106
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:45,242
Ah! Good job.
Ah! While you lean your head back.

1107
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:47,077
[Dohwadore screams]

1108
00:45:49,113 --> 00:45:50,848
I wanted the picture of Dohwadore

1109
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:52,349
to represent the standard influencer

1110
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:55,552
with the green light on one side
and purple light on the other.

1111
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:58,155
And I wanted him to look like
he was screaming.

1112
00:45:58,222 --> 00:46:01,291
Ah! Good job.
Ah! While you lean your head back.

1113
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:04,828
[Dohwadore] DaeDo's birth chart reading

1114
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:06,797
left a strong impression on me.

1115
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:08,398
[groans]

1116
00:46:08,465 --> 00:46:10,567
He's the complete opposite of me.

1117
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:12,870
His sense of direction
and stubbornness are not something

1118
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,972
that I can bend with my own will.

1119
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:17,708
- [DaeDo screams]
- [both screaming]

1120
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,943
[DaeDo laughs]
More, you're doing a good job!

1121
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:22,713
- [DaeDo] You can do it.
- Let me try. Okay. Yes, okay, I got this.

1122
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,548
[DaeDo] Use your leg like this
and go, "Aah!"

1123
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,450
And then you're going to look up that way.

1124
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:27,785
[DaeDo] Put your arm on your lap.

1125
00:46:27,851 --> 00:46:28,752
That's good.

1126
00:46:31,655 --> 00:46:34,324
- [DaeDo] Good. That's good. Oh, my god.
- [Dohwadore] Okay.

1127
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:35,492
- This is driving me crazy.
- Okay, so…

1128
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:38,162
are you going to try and edit now?
Do you need help?

1129
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:40,030
- [DaeDo] No, I'll do it.
- [Dohwadore] Okay.

1130
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:41,031
[Dohwadore] I'll see how long
we have left.

1131
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:42,533
- [DaeDo] Yeah, please do that.
- [Dohwadore] Okay.

1132
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:49,873
[Dohwadore] Twenty-one minutes.

1133
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:51,275
- [DaeDo] Twenty-one?
- [Dohwadore] Yeah.

1134
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:54,444
- Well, the real problem starts now.
- Mm.

1135
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:55,946
[DaeDo] Select.

1136
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:58,348
Then take this piece there…

1137
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:00,884
Maybe remove the black part here.
The black ceiling?

1138
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:02,920
- [DaeDo] Where? Oh, I see.
- [Dohwadore] Yeah, that part.

1139
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:06,023
Okay. So then I choose this
from the blender menu,

1140
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:08,125
then I'm removing this
with the eraser tool…

1141
00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:10,060
Okay, huh?

1142
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:11,195
It's not working?

1143
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:12,896
Why don't we add it to the background?

1144
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:14,765
Okay, I'm opening the background.

1145
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:15,966
[DaeDo] Why can't I add this?

1146
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:17,868
- Oh, with the money.
- [Dohwadore] Yeah, the money.

1147
00:47:18,535 --> 00:47:19,736
- This one.
- Oh.

1148
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:23,407
[DaeDo] This is driving me crazy.

1149
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:24,942
Don't worry too much, okay?

1150
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:28,579
- [Dohwadore] Click add.
- [DaeDo] Where's the add button?

1151
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:30,614
Huh? I can't find it.

1152
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:34,251
[DaeDo] Wait. Why is there an add button
for the background?

1153
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:36,486
[DaeDo] Why does this have
to be so difficult?

1154
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:38,522
I couldn't understand
why it wasn't working.

1155
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,625
'Cause I had no problem
when I practiced.

1156
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:42,926
[DaeDo] What's going on here?

1157
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:45,395
I think my mind was going totally blank.

1158
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:49,433
[host] The first game
will end in five minutes.

1159
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:52,202
[upbeat music]

1160
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:54,438
[RISABAE] This one is awesome.

1161
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:56,139
- [KEJIMIN] Really?
- [RISABAE] Yeah, it looks super cool.

1162
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:57,407
[KEJIMIN] Eight, please!

1163
00:47:57,474 --> 00:47:59,009
KEJIMIN
RISABAE

1164
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:01,311
[DaeDo] Oh, my god, this is so hard.

1165
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:02,880
Oh, why won't this work?

1166
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:04,448
I'll move this.

1167
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:09,920
[shrieks]

1168
00:48:09,987 --> 00:48:12,656
Oh, no! Are you okay? Are you good?

1169
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:15,259
- [Junwoo] Are you sure?
- [Juice Seyeon] You kicked me for real!

1170
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,662
JUICE SEYEON
JUNWOO

1171
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,697
- [PaniBottle] Wait, who else is there? Oh.
- DaeDo. Yeah.

1172
00:48:20,764 --> 00:48:23,100
Shoot! I don't think I can do this.

1173
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,702
[DaeDo] Ugh! I think we're really
in trouble now.

1174
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:28,772
But we have the second game,
so let's not worry too much about it.

1175
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:30,774
One team is eliminated per round.

1176
00:48:31,508 --> 00:48:32,943
Wait a minute, you're right.

1177
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:35,045
[tense music]

1178
00:48:35,112 --> 00:48:36,513
[DaeDo] Why can't I make it smaller?

1179
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,547
Come on.

1180
00:48:37,614 --> 00:48:40,217
- [Dohwadore] I think…
- Shoot. Wait, hold on.

1181
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:42,319
Uh-oh! Oh, no, come on!

1182
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:45,088
- [DaeDo] It's driving me crazy!
- [host] The first game will end

1183
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:47,190
- in two minutes.
- [DaeDo] Stop it.

1184
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,693
- [DaeDo] What is this?
- [Dohwadore] Yeah, click that.

1185
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:51,895
- [Dohwadore] It looks fine to me.
- [DaeDo] Okay.

1186
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:53,030
Let's just submit it.

1187
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:58,335
DAEDO
DOHWADORE

1188
00:48:58,402 --> 00:49:01,238
[host] The first game is now over.

1189
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:03,140
[DaeDo]
Photos are more difficult than video.

1190
00:49:03,206 --> 00:49:05,776
[Eun-ji] This round has been
really tough for me.

1191
00:49:05,842 --> 00:49:08,912
[host] The feed for the first game
will now be revealed.

1192
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:09,880
[Ji-sou] They're showing it.

1193
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,181
[exclaims]

1194
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:12,582
[KEJIMIN] Will they be in order?

1195
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:14,885
Or are they all coming out at once?

1196
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,520
ROUND 3, 1ST GAME

1197
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:22,059
- [RISABAE] That's what they were doing?
- [KEJIMIN] What? That's just his face.

1198
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,060
[Eun-ji] Wait a minute.

1199
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:26,129
What is that?
[shrieks, laughs]

1200
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:27,464
[MyBoo] They really did that?

1201
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:30,567
When I looked at the screen
where all the photos are gathered,

1202
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,302
my face was right smack
in the middle,

1203
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:33,470
and it looked really weird.

1204
00:49:33,537 --> 00:49:35,839
People would have no choice
but to look at it.

1205
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:37,541
I think we're safe.

1206
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:39,142
- [MyBoo] It's so annoying.
- [DaeDo] Yeah.

1207
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:42,145
The photo was just OKING's giant face.

1208
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:44,047
So I was like, what's up with that?

1209
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:46,316
[PaniBottle]
It was hard not to look at it.

1210
00:49:46,883 --> 00:49:49,119
[Dohwadore] OKING's photo
in slot five caught my attention

1211
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:51,655
because I could read
the fortune in his face.

1212
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:52,956
[laughs]

1213
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:56,727
[laughs]

1214
00:49:56,793 --> 00:49:59,963
I think their photo
didn't really meet the standards.

1215
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:02,332
I was worried
about the production team after seeing it.

1216
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:04,468
Weren't you? If had to choose last place,

1217
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:06,703
I'd go with Jang Ji-sou and OKING.

1218
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:09,573
ROUND 3, 1ST GAME
KEJIMIN, RISABAE

1219
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:13,744
- This photo is super cool.
- I want to upload it on my feed.

1220
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:15,212
- Do it.
- [Eun-ji] It looks great.

1221
00:50:16,813 --> 00:50:19,082
ROUND 3, 1ST GAME
JIN YONG-JIN, PYO EUN-JI

1222
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:23,587
What is that?

1223
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:25,122
- Wait, what?
- Well…

1224
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:27,090
Those are cracks on the screen.

1225
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:28,859
[awkward scream]

1226
00:50:28,925 --> 00:50:30,260
[Eun-ji] I felt anxious.

1227
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:32,929
[tense music]

1228
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:36,333
JANG KEUN-SUK'S GOING VIRAL
FOR THE LEAKED PHOTO OF HIS GF

1229
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,501
- [Eun-ji] Wait, no way!
- [DaeDo] His girlfriend?

1230
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:39,169
- Are you guys kidding me?
- It's eye-catching.

1231
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:40,570
Wow, that was smart.

1232
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:44,274
Well, the caption in the photo

1233
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:46,276
was just impossible to ignore.

1234
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:49,546
How do I say it? I felt kind of bitter.

1235
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:53,150
Man, I could have taken
that photo with him.

1236
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,218
[Eun-ji] I could've pretended
to be his girlfriend.

1237
00:50:56,953 --> 00:50:58,255
[OKING] He's pulling the girlfriend card?

1238
00:50:59,089 --> 00:51:00,924
It inspired me to come up with more ideas.

1239
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:03,126
And the picture
definitely caught my attention.

1240
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,129
[KEJIMIN] After seeing the caption
about girlfriend,

1241
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:07,664
I was like, "Wait, you can do that?"

1242
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,100
It felt like I got hit
in the head or something.

1243
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:11,968
ROUND 3, 1ST GAME
JUICE SEYEON, JUNWOO

1244
00:51:12,035 --> 00:51:13,970
I didn't know we have that.

1245
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:15,105
[Dohwadore] We never saw it.

1246
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:17,774
They had a panel that said "prize money".

1247
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:20,610
Well, I can say their storytelling
wasn't straightforward.

1248
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:22,546
It was so different from ours.

1249
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:28,652
ROUND 3, 1ST GAME
DAEDO, DOHWADORE

1250
00:51:28,718 --> 00:51:30,720
What were they going for with this?

1251
00:51:31,321 --> 00:51:33,123
[MyBoo] The picture was just confusing.

1252
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:37,027
It was like this collage of all the rooms
with so many different things going on.

1253
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,895
As soon as I saw it, I was like,

1254
00:51:38,962 --> 00:51:40,497
I know who's going home.

1255
00:51:41,531 --> 00:51:44,401
I didn't understand what their picture
was really trying to convey.

1256
00:51:44,468 --> 00:51:46,570
It's like they wanted it to look flashy,

1257
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:48,605
but who'd look at that for seven seconds?

1258
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:49,639
ROUND 3, 1ST GAME
PANIBOTTLE, BBOGUMI

1259
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:50,740
[Juice Seyeon]
This one is a killer, right?

1260
00:51:50,807 --> 00:51:52,509
Wow, that's actually so cool.

1261
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:54,478
[DaeDo] Team BBOGUMI
and PaniBottle's picture

1262
00:51:54,544 --> 00:51:56,480
was really eye-catching.

1263
00:51:56,546 --> 00:51:57,914
It's quite artistic.

1264
00:51:57,981 --> 00:52:00,217
[host] I'll now show you which photo

1265
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:04,521
captured the attention
of the 100 judges for the longest.

1266
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:06,156
Please, we'll do better next time.

1267
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:07,791
No one did it like we did.

1268
00:52:13,063 --> 00:52:14,531
- Heh? Whoa!
- What?

1269
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:15,799
Huh?

1270
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:18,635
[host] These points represent
the eye-tracking results

1271
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:20,804
of the judges who viewed the feed.

1272
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:22,139
They used eye-tracking.

1273
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:24,774
For all 100 of them? Amazing.

1274
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:26,209
[MyBoo] Eye-tracking?

1275
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:27,744
I didn't expect that.

1276
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,079
[DaeDo] After I saw it,

1277
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:31,248
I thought,
"Wow! I didn't see that coming."

1278
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:33,617
[host] The gazes of all the judges

1279
00:52:33,683 --> 00:52:37,587
have been tracked
and quantified as a real-time data.

1280
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:42,092
[tense music]

1281
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:51,101
START

1282
00:52:57,107 --> 00:52:59,643
[tense music continues]

1283
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:08,018
[host]
We will now announce the elimination

1284
00:53:08,084 --> 00:53:10,487
of the first game of Round 3.

1285
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:13,423
[closing theme music]
