Do you have any more?

- [WETBOY] Dislikes?
- Wait, you're collecting dislikes?

14
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:49,916
- [influencer 2] Yeah.
- I think you're looking at this backwards.

15
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:51,951
- I heard they're collecting dislikes.
- You know that saying,

00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:54,287
"A true star drives everybody crazy."

17
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:55,622

That's when things
really started to shift.

I could press.

- But, some Koreans think--

[Yong-jin]
I think it's all about attention.

142
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,308
How much attention can you get
as an influencer?

143
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,410
- Exactly. I think they are wrong.
- [BBULKUP] That can't be right.

144
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:45,878
- [Yong-jin] That's the point.
- [A-reum-song-e] Is it about popularity?

145
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:47,513
[Hyun-seo] It's clear dislike is good.

146
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,917
The first round is… it's about
who is more qualified to be an influencer.

147
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,452
[FITVELY]
I guess this round is more important.

I predicted this.

158
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:19,479
For me, I thought that it was unfair

159
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,315
that I had to compete
against an actual celebrity.

160
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,785
I think it was just my way
of keeping him in check.

Jang Keun-seuk made his intro video
so half-heartedly.

00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:44,370
I think Caddiewanny asked people
to give him dislikes as well.

170
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,105
His ranking is way up there.

171
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:47,373
Hope I'm in the next round.

3 DISLIKES

173
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:50,910
Will they combine scores?

174
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:51,911
[WETBOY] I have no idea.

175
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:54,347
But they didn't even say
what the criteria were.

176
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,516
I wonder how the dislikes
are going to affect us.

177
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,785
But, is it a good thing
to be ranked highly?

178
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:01,821
Well, I don't think being ranked high
for dislikes is a good thing.

179
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,489
Are dislikes deducted?

180
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:05,425
- I don't know.
- [Changhyun] I think they combine them.

181
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:08,694
[Napkins] I'm completely confused.
What's happening? Anyone?

182
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,096
[host] The first round was…

183
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:16,569
about proving your individual presence
as an influencer.

184
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,571
- [influencer 3] Our presence?
- Yeah, presence.

185
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,206
Okay, it was about our presence.

186
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:26,512
[host] Influencers
are always the center of attention.

187
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:29,615
And the likes and dislikes you received…

188
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:32,485
[suspenseful music]

189
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,923
…are proportional
to how much attention you drew in.

190
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:37,924
Wow.

191
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,327
[host] So, an influencer,
who is the object of indifference

192
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:44,797
by receiving neither likes
nor dislikes will be eliminated.

193
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:46,098
[gasping]

194
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:48,100
[chortles]

195
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,271
Wow!

196
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:53,739
[Keun-suk] This is great.

197
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:58,911
You know, I feel like my life has been
full of dislikes to begin with.

198
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,279
[laughs]

199
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:03,015
And because
I can handle criticism pretty well,

200
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:06,419
I was able to use
this situation to my advantage.

201
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:10,022
Here, having talent
or being a good host will come in handy.

202
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:12,291
Without presence, you're nothing.

203
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:14,794
[Yong-jin] I love that
things went according to my plan.

204
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,430
- That was it.
- Wow, I can't believe it was presence.

205
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,332
We should have been getting dislikes, too.

206
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:21,901
I'm in trouble.

207
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,769
Wow, that sure was a twist.

208
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,938
[host]
However, if multiple influencers

209
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,274
received the exact same number of votes,

210
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,810
the one with the higher worth
will rank higher.

211
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:32,879
[groans]
So, this is important to know as well.

212
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:39,018
[host] I'll now reveal the final
results combining the likes and dislikes.

213
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,386
Oh, no!

214
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:41,921
Oh, my God!

215
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,556
Come on, come on.

216
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,659
- So, we need to be in the top 30?
- [Yong-jin] Exactly.

217
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,828
- Please let me be in the top 30.
- [influencer 4] Oh, no.

226
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:11,350
I think being an attention seeker
is important

227
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,986
that's just how things work these days.

228
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,955
I love being first.

229
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,391
It comes naturally.

230
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,893

that I made it as the guy
with the most dislikes.

238
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,678
It's good to be in first place
no matter what though.

239
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,046
I was happy with it.

240
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,382

249
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:03,769
were my usual haters commenting.
Are they criticisms of my video?

250
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:05,404
It frustrated me.

251
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:09,675
Because I kind of felt like
everyone was just ignoring me.

00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,150
Uh, I'm pissed.

332
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,752
HEO SEONG-BEOM, ELIMINATED
MODEL

333
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:09,555
In the end, the influencers
who got a ton of dislikes,

334
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,458
whether they did something
to deserve it or not.

335
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:16,362
They all got that number of dislikes
for a reason.

336
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:18,531
So, I can accept the results.

337
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:20,432
They influenced.

338
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:21,367
MEJIWOO, ELIMINATED
FASHION AND COSMETICS CEO

339
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:25,371
Yeah, it was pretty shocking.
But honestly, it makes a lot of sense.

340
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:28,741
'Cause it's scarier to get no reaction.

341
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:29,842
CHARMING JO, ELIMINATED
MUSIC YOUTUBER

342
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,945
During my time on YouTube,
there weren't really haters,

343
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:36,782
and I've always had this feeling that
not having that level of attention

344
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:40,419
was one of the reasons it took me
a long time to grow as a creator.

345
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,054
I felt that here again.

346
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:42,955
CHAHONG, SURVIVED
HAIR STYLIST

347
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:44,924
I think the idea
that you only have a presence

348
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,659
if you receive love is wrong.

349
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:49,595
But on the other hand,
I don't want to be hated.

350
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,031
I mean it's a real dilemma.

351
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:57,369
It's all because of this darn collar!

352
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:58,637
I'm just kidding.

353
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,174
[sighs]

354
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,485
[tense music]

355
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:25,264
[host] Congrats to all of you
who have survived.

356
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:28,300
[cheers, whoops]

357
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:30,636
We did it.

358
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:34,506
[host] We will now reveal

359
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:36,942
the final ranking
of your first round total

360
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,945
after absorbing the worth
of those eliminated.

361
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,516
- Wow, somebody has 70 million.
- Seventy million won?

362
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:45,417
ROUND 1 FINAL RANKING

363
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:47,353
[Junwoo] Sia_jiwoo has 72 million.

364
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,822
[host] The top three influencers

365
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,225
with the highest worth
have been selected as VIPs

366
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:57,029
 and will now receive special benefits
to use in the next round.

367
00:14:57,096 --> 00:15:00,900
We will now reveal the mission
for the second round.

368
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,202
- [KEJIMIN] Seriously?
- Wait, what's going on?

369
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:06,505
- Oh, my gosh
- Wait, there's a mission? Oh, my God.

370
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,876
[host] The second round mission
shows where you can prove your influence…

371
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,145
through live streaming.

372
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:14,647
[influencers exclaim]

373
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:15,848
ROUND 2 KEYWORD
LIVE STREAMING

374
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:16,782
NEEDMORECASH
SHORT-FORM CREATOR

375
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,384
No! I'm in trouble.

376
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,387
Oh, no, live streaming
is a weak spot for me.

377
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:25,724
[Yong-jin] Not my thing either.
It's something I'm not very good at

378
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,494
and there are strong competitors
like OKING.

379
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,130
Live streaming is OKING's whole thing.

380
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,532
I looked around…

381
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,968
[Keun-suk] I was like,
"Who's the most excited about this?"

382
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:39,138
and I saw OKING going,
"Aha!" and running off.

383
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:40,940
Live streaming is in my blood.

384
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:42,007
OKING
STREAMER & YOUTUBER

385
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:44,376
Being in the moment,
there aren't many people here

386
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,411
who have that same advantage.

387
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:46,779
But I do.

388
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,381
[DaeDo] Jang Keun-suk's going
to ace this round.

389
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,384
[WETBOY] Jang Keun-suk's going to win
'cause he has a ton of followers.

390
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,353
JUNWOO
STREAMER & YOUTUBER

391
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,456
Since live streaming
is something I specialize in…

392
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:58,857
I think I have an advantage.

393
00:15:58,924 --> 00:15:59,758
JUICE SEYEON
AFREECATV STREAMER

394
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:00,960
It's a piece of cake.

395
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:01,894
BBOGUMI
STREAMER & YOUTUBER

396
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,430
I'm going to win.
[BBOGUMI giggles]

397
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:06,231
[RISABAE] For influencers,

398
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,033
live streaming's a way
to prove our presence.

399
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:08,968
RISABAE
BEAUTY CREATOR

400
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:12,237
It really shows our individual brand.

401
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,274
Also, the ability to attract attention
and gain more followers.

402
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:17,910
I'd say that's the point
of live streaming.

403
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:23,248
Live streaming is about communicating
with your viewers in real time.

404
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,517
That's the best part
of watching a live stream.

405
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,254
KEJIMIN
TIKTOK CREATOR

406
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,857
[KEJIMIN] Honestly, I'm a little nervous.

407
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,559
I don't really do a ton of live streams.

408
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:34,493
SIA_JIWOO
TIKTOK CREATOR

409
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,427
DOCTOR WHO
TIKTOK CREATOR

410
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,162
I don't know how to live stream.

411
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,498
[GATO] Let's get through this round.

412
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:40,432
QUEEN WA$ABII
RAPPER

413
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,167
I don't know that much to do live.

414
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:43,302
I don't know.

415
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:44,203
KERRIGAN MAY
RAPPER

416
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:45,771
[Kerrigan May] What should I do?

417
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,041
THE INFLUENCER

418
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,644
[host] A warm welcome

419
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:56,715
to the 30 of you who have made it
to Round 2 of The Influencer.

420
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,651
- [whoops]
- [applauds]

421
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:02,955
I'm nervous.

422
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,224
[host] In the second round
of the competition,

423
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:09,161
only 15 influencers will make it
to Round 3.

424
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:10,963
[exclaims]

425
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,664
[influencer 1] It just got real.

426
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:15,467
[host] The second round live stream

427
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,971
will be divided into two parts.
One and two.

428
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:23,542
The duration of the first half
will be 60 minutes.

429
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,878
The number of live stream viewers

430
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:27,613
will be tallied every ten seconds.

431
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,349
And rankings will be based
on the average number of viewers

432
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,217
over the 60 minutes.

433
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:35,888
In the first half,
the top five influencers

434
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:38,090
with the highest viewership will survive.

435
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:39,091
Oh?

436
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:41,226
[host] And move to Round 3.

437
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:42,661
[exclaims]

438
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,364
The people in the top five
aren't going to participate

439
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,099
- in the second half at all.
- Yeah, that's right.

440
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,734
Aah! Whoa, shit!

441
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:49,868
Too easy.

442
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:52,638
I don't think I'll be in the top five.

443
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:55,941
[host] The bottom five influencers
with the lowest viewership

444
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,010
will be eliminated.

445
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,879
[influencer 2] So then everyone else
is going to move on to the second half.

446
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:03,449
[GVAN] Look, if I ended up
in the bottom five,

447
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:05,918
I'm going to feel
like a total piece of trash.

448
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,953
I don't want to be in the bottom five.

449
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,055
Wow, seriously?

450
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,324
[KEJIMIN] That seems pretty unfair.

451
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:16,328
[host] The second half will have
different rules from the first half.

452
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,866
In the second half,
we will decide on who survives

453
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:25,070
and who is eliminated
simultaneously every five minutes.

454
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,805
- [KEJIMIN] Shit.
- [Keun-suk] Really?

455
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:29,775
- Wait, what?
- Without doing the whole thing?

456
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,743
That sounds so nuts.

457
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:32,678
I'm scared.

458
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:34,179
- [influencer 3] That's so cruel.
- So brutal.

459
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,584
In order to maintain average viewership

460
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,452
I need to keep everyone engaged.

461
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:43,722
I mean it's important for me
to provide interesting content.

462
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:44,790
In the second half,

463
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,992
it's for a shorter period of time.

464
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,761
So I have to be super entertaining
from the get-go.

465
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,799
[host] Starting Round 2.

466
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:58,170
Gather your viewers to survive.

467
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:02,808
You may now enter your individual cubicle

468
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,711
and prepare for your first live stream.

469
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:06,812
[Ji-sou] Wait, what?

470
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,247
Oh, our names are on it.

471
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,248
[influencer 3] Okay.

472
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,918
[influencer 4]
I'm going to invite viewers.

473
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,353
- [Yong-jin] Let's go.
- [MyBoo] Let's rock this.

474
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:15,420
[GATO] Let's do this.

475
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,089
- [Sia_jiwoo] Good luck.
- [influencer 5] Bye.

476
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,190
[KEJIMIN] Yeah, girl.

477
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:22,694
It smells in here.

478
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:24,196
SIA_JIWOO, 1ST IN WORTH VIP,
300 VIEWERS ADDED FOR THE FIRST HALF

479
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,065
[scats]

480
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:28,600
KEJIMIN, 2ND IN WORTH VIP,
200 VIEWERS ADDED FOR THE FIRST HALF

481
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:32,037
GATO, 3RD IN WORTH VIP, ADDED
100 VIEWERS FOR THE FIRST HALF

482
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,105
Wow.

483
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,373
9TH, OKING
STREAMER & YOUTUBER

484
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:35,774
Ah, here I am.

485
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,677
Hard to know how it will turn out
for a TikToker.

486
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:41,680
Because they already have
over ten million followers.

487
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,749
[WETBOY]
Hold on, you have so much wall space.

488
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:45,350
- What? What are you talking about?
- Hyung, Keun-suk,

489
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,753
what's all that over there?
Come on, what is this?

490
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:50,055
- You said you weren't prepared.
- No, seriously, it's really nothing.

491
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:52,391
[WETBOY] You were like,
"I didn't prepare anything."

492
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:54,092
[Keun-suk]
It's nothing special, believe me.

493
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:56,328
[WETBOY] What? That's gourmet!

494
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:59,064
- Oh, wow, look at that.
- [Kerrigan May] This room is pretty nice.

495
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,066
- This is crazy.
- [Keun-suk] Don't look too hard at it.

496
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,969
I was like, "Oh, of course."

497
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,104
Mukbang looks great for a live stream.

498
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:07,039
But it won't be easy.

499
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:08,874
For sure. But…

500
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:11,610
You know,
it's also important to think about

501
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:14,046
who you are going to invite
to view this kind of thing.

502
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:16,949
Wait, seriously, you invited an actress.

503
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:18,617
- An actress?
- An actress? Who?

504
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:21,019
- It's Seorina. You've all heard of her.
- Aah.

505
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:23,188
I'm so happy that Seorina

506
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,424
is going to be joining
the live streaming with me.

507
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,092
It's going to be awesome.

508
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,761
I couldn't pay much, though.
[laughs]

509
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:33,966
- [influencer 6] Whoa, that's Dr. Hong.
- [influencer 7] That guy's a legend.

00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,102
Do you guys think I should take my shirt
off when I reach 5,000 viewers?

512
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:38,203
6TH, SHERRY
TIKTOK CREATOR

513
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,873
Usually, when I film challenge videos
with Dr. Hong

514
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,110
The views start at around 600 minimum.

515
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:48,413
[Sherry] He's popular on TikTok
which is watched by a younger audience

516
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,382
so he's my wild card.

517
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:53,452
From what I heard,

518
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:55,354
it seems like a lot
of the other competitors

519
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,156
are bringing in celebrities
as collaborative guests or whatever.

520
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,493
And to be honest,
I'm pretty confident in this challenge

521
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,295
even without special guests.

522
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,697
Oh, no, I'm so nervous.

523
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:08,233
I was totally bluffing
during the interview.

524
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,801
[laughs]

525
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:12,437
[host] One minute until go time.

526
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,707
Okay, let's go!

527
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,277
One minute to go.

535
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:30,822
I can do this.

536
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,194
[host] Now commencing,

537
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:38,897
the first half
of live streaming competition.

538
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:42,000
- [Ji-sou] Let's go!
- [WETBOY] I'm pumped!

539
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:42,901

two,

543
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:47,439

Hello.

Hey, can you hear me?

549
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:03,055
Can you hear me?

550
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:05,957
Wow. The year is 2024!

551
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:09,094
Happy New Year!

552
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:10,862
Whoo-hoo!

553
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,765

Yeah, so, hi. Yeah.

556
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:21,473
Could we warm up for a little bit?
Just for a few minutes.

557
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,175
Hey, everyone, what's going on?

OKING
2.1M YOUTUBE SUBSCRIBERS

559
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,045
So, Netflix is releasing
this new show which is awesome

560
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:29,548
and I'm actually on this show
right this second.

561
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:31,283
So, you're on Netflix too.

562
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,918
"Hi, Netflix." "I'm on TV!"

563
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:33,852
I'M ON TV, MOM

564
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,888
This is it!
This is what live streaming is all about.

565
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:38,190
So, listen guys,

566
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:40,625
today I'm going to give you
a little bit of my backstory

567
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,494
to give you a flavor of who I am.

568
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:43,862
Hi, guys.

569
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:46,231
Oh.

There's so many of you.

572
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:51,269
I prepared some greetings
in different languages.

573
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:53,238
[speaking French, Spanish]
Bonjour. Adios.

574
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:54,673
[speaking Portuguese]
Boa tarde.

575
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,841
[speaking Italian]
Buongiorno.

576
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:57,275
In Turkish, merhaba.

577
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,882
ALL SECRETS REVEALED

578
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:05,550
Hi, everyone.

579
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:09,121
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR VIDEOS?

580
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:11,289
JIN YONG-JIN
YOUTUBER & DIRECTOR

581
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:13,024
HE'S DRINKING ALREADY
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?

582
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:14,693
WHAT'S WITH HIM?

583
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:16,762
Listen, I have no interest

584
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:18,730
in doing a boring livestream.

585
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:21,400
'Cause last time I only had 800 viewers.

586
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:22,768
I wasn't doing that again.

587
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:26,004
And I needed to bring in more people
not just my usual subscribers

588
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,239
but others as well.

589
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:28,673
I had to try something.

590
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:32,944
[Yong-jin] So, I decided
I was going to troll the masses.

591
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:36,248
To start I set all my videos
to private during prep time.

592
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:38,583
PRIVATE

593
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,719
JIN YONG-JIN
THERE ARE NO VIDEOS TO SHOW

594
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:44,423
[Yong-jin] And I kept monitoring
people's reaction to it.

595
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,894
I thought that if a YouTuber
with two million subscribers

596
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,097
had a problem with his channel
it could draw people in.

597
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:54,766
So, I thought I'd turn on the stream

598
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,668
to have a discussion with you guys

599
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:59,905
and share some thoughts
I've been having about things.

600
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:01,807
Nothing out of the ordinary.

601
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:04,676
I GUESS HE'S ON NETFLIX TOO
IS THIS FOR NETFLIX?

602
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:06,545
What's the show about? Great.

603
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:10,816
I'm definitely going to explain
what this Netflix show is about

604
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:12,784
towards the end of the live stream.

605
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:15,053
Oh, where'd all my videos go?

606
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,855
Mm.

607
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:19,591
Yeah, don't worry about it.
I'll explain where all the videos went

608
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:23,195
in the later part of the live stream
like I just mentioned a few seconds ago.

609
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:24,763
No, I'm not messing with you.

610
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,199
There's a reason I can't tell you
all of this right now.

611
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:29,968
So, I'm asking you to please stay tuned
until the end of this.

612
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:32,804
I know that people who decided
to join my livestream

613
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:35,474
were curious about what was going on.

614
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:39,511
So basically, my plan was to bait them
every ten minutes or so

615
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:41,880
and then give them the real answer
towards the end.

616
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,982
How many viewers have I got now?

617
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:47,519
If 7,000 people
stay for the next ten minutes

618
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:50,489
I'm going to reveal
my monthly income to all of you.

619
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:51,857
It's not easy for me.

620
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:56,161
And if you stay for longer than that
I'll gradually unveil some secrets

621
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:57,796
about other parts of my life too.

622
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:59,364
Because I'm going to reveal to you

623
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,666
why I'm even doing this livestream
at the end of it.

624
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:02,968
You've really got to stick around.

625
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:05,537
So please, stay tuned for your own sake.

626
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,707
I HAVE A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT

627
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:11,977
Hey, everyone. Hello guys.

628
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:15,247
All right, it's true.
I was trying to get your attention.

629
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:16,815
I've got a big announcement.

630
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:19,317
Well, actually a small one.

631
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:21,186
Nope, not getting married.

632
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:22,587
Not getting a vasectomy

633
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:26,458
or taking over Netflix,
and no penis enhancement surgery.

634
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,293
Definitely not. You're all wrong.

635
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,761
ARE YOU CONFIDENT ABOUT YOUR SIZE?
PENISBOTTLE LOL

636
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,765
The biggest difference
between TV stars and influencers

637
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:37,402
is that TV stars are distant
and not approachable.

638
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:40,438
Whereas influencers talk directly
with their followers.

639
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:43,074
[PaniBottle] Live streams
are a great way to do that

640
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:45,043
'cause you chat in real time.

641
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:48,513
I basically prepare the bare minimum
to talk about.

642
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,415
So what I'm going to do today is…

643
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:54,519
"The New Year's program proposal
by PaniBottle."

644
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:55,720
This is because

645
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:58,790
I always consider
putting influencing on YouTube.

646
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,561
I wanted to show you a proposal
of the kinds of shows I'd make

647
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:05,030
when I eventually become a producer.

648
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:07,232
Okay, so the first idea is…

649
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:09,234
camper van romance.

650
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:14,339
I came up with this dating show idea
when I visited Australia in early 2023.

651
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,741
With four men in a tiny camper van,

652
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:19,578
we couldn't avoid
physical contact between us.

653
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:20,645
So then I thought,

654
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:23,014
"Wished we had some women there too."

655
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:26,351
Imagine three men and three women
in a camper van.

656
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,485
We'd work out the rest…

657
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:29,654
"Camping Inferno."
[chuckles]

658
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:31,323
Just like that show.

659
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:33,091
Folks, I am going to cast

660
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:35,794
some good-looking men and women
for this show.

661
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,162
Yeah, I wouldn't be on it.

662
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:39,564
And neither with KwakTube. That's right.

663
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:41,800
Huh? "They'll get pregnant!"
[laughs]

664
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:42,901
IT'LL SOLVE OUR LOW BIRTH RATE
HOW WILL THEY FART?

665
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:45,670
Okay, thanks for being so blunt guys.

666
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:48,173
And number two, "Trip to the Origin."

667
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:51,309
I'm the protagonist.
Let's say we're enjoying some pizza.

668
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:55,280
The ingredients are flour, olives,
fish, ham, things like that.

669
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:56,181
FISH ON PIZZA?

670
00:26:56,247 --> 00:27:00,218
So, I'll travel to the country of origin
for each ingredient

671
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,987
Let's say the olives are Greek,

672
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:04,789
then I'd go to Greece
and harvest the olives myself.

673
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:06,524
The flour's from Chile,

674
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:09,194
so I'll go to Chile and get some flour.

675
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,762
I'll always be in China.

676
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:12,297
RICE: FROM CHINA, CHILI: FROM CHINA,
FLOUR: FROM CHINA

677
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:14,499
I'm only going to go to China.

678
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,769
[RISABAE]
Today on "Shameless Makeup Challenge,"

679
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:20,772
I'm doing a look that's super popular
amongst the wealthy.

680
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:22,240
So, what I'm going to do

681
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,377
is contour right here
to make my forehead look rounder.

682
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:27,946
See just like this.

683
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:30,348
RISABAE
FIRST-GEN BEAUTY CREATOR

684
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:32,851
Is everyone's forehead getting rounder?

685
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:37,455
Thank you for saying I look like someone
who could be from Cheongdam-dong but,

686
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,391
I'm not rich yet.

687
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:42,460
All right guys I'm going to try this out,

688
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:44,696
wealthy-looking make-up as a test.

689
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:48,566
And then you guys can follow along with me
and hope you'll become rich too.

690
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:50,235
So my concept for Round 2 is…

691
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:52,570
Shameless Make-up Challenge.

692
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:54,406
It's actually my signature content.

693
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:57,075
It's something I'm comfortable doing
in front of a lot of viewers.

694
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:59,477
[RISABAE] I chose to do
the Shameless Make-up Challenge

695
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:02,080
because I wanted to stick
to what people expect

696
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:03,548
and enjoy the most from me

697
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:06,618
rather than trying out
a completely new format.

698
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,987
Each episode has a specific concept.

699
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:12,223
For example, if the concept
is arrogant-looking make-up,

700
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:15,126
my viewers give me
directions and suggestions

701
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:18,463
on how to make myself
look more arrogant using the make-up.

702
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:22,300
So today, I'm going to do
wealthy-looking make-up for my viewers.

703
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,537
I'm a livestream pro
'cause I can read all the comments

704
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:27,272
no matter how fast they come.

705
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:31,342
And then, I'll pick out the most
interesting comments to respond to.

706
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:34,913
Okay, this forehead make-up is done
and looking good.

707
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:36,948
I'm going to work on my eyebrows now.

708
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:39,050
You guys are always telling me that

709
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:41,886
a three-centimeter gap
between eyes and brows.

710
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:43,388
And that length is…

711
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:45,724
it's too far.

712
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:47,625
All the way up here?

713
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:49,094
ERASE YOUR BROWS
YOU'LL HAVE TO ERASE THEM

714
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,795
Then I'll erase them.

715
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:52,630
[RISABAE] I think I'll draw them on.

716
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:56,935
Two centimeters
above my original eyebrows?

717
00:28:58,002 --> 00:29:01,840
Okay, let's see.
So it's three centimeters from here?

718
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:05,243
Look at this. It means that
they should have been up here then.

719
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:08,046
IT'S SO FUNNY
THAT SHE BROUGHT A RULER LOL

720
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:10,782
Here?

721
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,752
This seems way too high.

722
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:16,721
You're saying, "I'd rather not be rich."
[laughs]

723
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:19,758
No, no, you have to be. Stick with me.

724
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:21,259
IT'S HARD TO BECOME RICH

725
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:23,261
"It seems hard to get rich."

726
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,029
Well, bite the bullet.

727
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:28,199
You're all on this together with me
for the next hour, you guys.

728
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,535
[RISABAE] So here,
here is exactly three centimeters.

729
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:33,338
"Those cruel Netflix people."
[laughs]

730
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:34,739
IS IT OKAY TO GO ON NETFLIX
LOOKING LIKE THIS?

731
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:39,043
THE GAP BETWEEN YOUR BROWS
SHOULD BE HALF A FINGER WIDE

732
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,411
This base here?

733
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:44,549
It should be wide enough to fit
two fingers in this base between them.

734
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:47,085
So do you all think
I should make it wider then?

735
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:49,521
[RISABAE] Wait a second.

736
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:51,623
I'm trying to… make this base

737
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:53,992
between my eyebrows wider
like you ask me to.

738
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:56,928
Oh. Do I look wealthy now?

739
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:01,266
[RISABAE] Okay, I'm going to put on
the eyelashes now.

740
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:03,735
So, the thing with eyelashes is…

741
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:07,205
I'm going to put them on here
then I'm going to…

742
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:10,575
"Is this make-up for hell?"
[laughs]

743
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,044
Oh, the lip liner should be well-defined?

744
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:15,313
How's this look?

745
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:22,854
IT'S LIKE YOU DIDN'T WIPE YOUR MOUTH
AFTER EATING BLACK NOODLES

746
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:25,156
I think I look so much better now.

747
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,393
I think I'm definitely
starting to look wealthy.

748
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,728
Rich people have a lot to laugh about.

749
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:32,864
[quirky music]

750
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:33,932
Very funny.

751
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:36,501
So they have deep laugh lines.

752
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:39,437
Well, actually it seems like rich people
have deep everything.

753
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:40,371
Hold on a sec.

754
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:46,778
"Hey, girl did you know,
rich people have three eyes."

755
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:49,280
Who are you Na-young?

756
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,415
Hey, Na-young.

757
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:52,817
Hope you get rich.

758
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:55,520
"I've decided to live frugally."

759
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:56,654
NAYOUNG: I'VE DECIDED TO LIVE FRUGALLY

760

CHOIJAE: SHAKE YOUR EYELINER
IF YOU ARE BEING HELD CAPTIVE

762
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:06,097
No, seriously
I'm so excited to be on Netflix

763
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:08,933
with all my followers who believed in me
since the beginning.

764
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,836
But who knew I'd be on the show
with this rich-looking face?

765
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:15,673
"Is this really how you want to look
on Netflix girl, is it?"

766
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:19,077
[laughs]

767
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:20,745
How am I so funny?

768
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:25,383
[RISABAE] How is it possible for me
to make people laugh with just my face?

769
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,186
I seriously… don't know.

770
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:30,421
JANG KEUN-SUK'S IT MIGHT BE SPICY

771
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:34,425
I thought for my live stream
we should endure some pain.

772
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:36,728
I'm going to endure it with you,
don't worry.

773
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,796
We're going to eat some spicy food today.

774
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:41,032
I approached this challenge based on data.

775
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:45,403
When I think about which of my videos
are really successful with the viewers,

776
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,872
it seems like the ones
where I'm eating really spicy food

777
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:51,709
get a lot of views,
especially from people who live overseas.

778

THE PORK CUTLET OF DEATH, 1.65M VIEWS

779
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:58,716
I chose "It's Going to be Spicy"
because I thought it was something viewers

780
00:31:58,783 --> 00:31:59,651
are going to enjoy.

781
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:02,453
Without any language barriers present.

782
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,855
And I also thought it would be more fun

783
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,356
if I invited someone as a guest

784
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,959
who can handle spicy food
better than I could

785
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:10,461
and we could eat it together.

786
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:11,763
[Keun-suk] I prepped some Silbi Kimchi.

787
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:12,664
SILBI KIMCHI
BUSAN MAPTTEOK

788
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,399
[Keun-suk] Deep it in the sauce like this.

789
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:15,800

I have to go all in and commit myself
for the first half of this challenge.

798
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,696
[sighs]

799
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:46,297
LOOK AT HIM SWEATING
DON'T PUSH YOURSELF TOO HARD

800
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:50,401
One of you guys suggested this.

801
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:52,804
So…
[groans]

802
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,739
THERE'S THE KICK
IT COMES LATER

803
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,041
Let me introduce this place to you all.

804
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,812
It's in Seoul…
[coughs]

805
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:04,382
…they serve curry.
I heard this curry is really spicy.

806
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:05,783
I'm going to try it.

807
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:09,887
[quirky music]

808
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:11,356
YOUR EYES ARE RED

809
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:13,992
I don't feel it yet.
I don't feel it. Not at all.

810
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:17,261
It's good. I can't taste the spiciness.

811
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,563
[sniffles]

812
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,365
YOU'RE NOT ANGRY, ARE YOU?

813

EAT SPICY FOOD
WHEN YOU SHOOT ANGRY SCENES

814
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:27,538
I'm not sure if other people would feel
the same way I do about this though.

815
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,807
I'll let someone else try it.

816
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:30,875

817
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:33,644
YOU'VE SNIFFLED 80 TIMES

00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:35,947
Here, try it. Is it spicy?

819
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:37,648
No, right?

820
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:41,352
Oh, wow…

I NEVER EXPECTED
TO SEE YOU BLOWING YOUR NOSE

I think this is where…
[chuckles]

828
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:07,845
…we see what kind of ruthless monsters
that influencers can be

829
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:10,782
to try to get more viewers
to watch our live streams.

830
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,752
"Stop it."

00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:16,554

going to have a special guest.

839
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:38,543
His name is Dasha Taran.

840
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:40,611
So, I hope you're all going to stay tuned.

841
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:42,413
To the livestream.

842
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:45,750
My strategy is collaborative.

843
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:48,519
[host]
A guest can only be brought in once,

844
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,621
either on the first or second half

845
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:53,791
and they can stay on the livestream
for a maximum of 30 minutes.

846
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:54,759
AN HOUR AGO

847
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:56,828
I think I'll bring mine
during the second half.

848
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:59,097
[WETBOY] Should I bring my guest
in the second half too, then?

849
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:03,000
Should my guest join me
in the first or second half?

850
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:04,869
I think I need to change my plan

851
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,004
[MyBoo] and invite my guest
in the second half of the stream.

852
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:08,673
[Needmorecash]
I'm not making it to the top five,

853
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:11,109
so I'm doing my guest in the second half.

854
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,780
Dasha Taran has over
five million followers on Instagram.

855
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:19,684
The goal of this live stream is to attract
more of Dasha's fans to my broadcast.

856
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,524
- Yeah!
- Hey, girl!

857
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,559
I'm so glad you're here, girl.

858
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,595
- Thanks for coming.
- Sia!

859
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:32,897
Hi, Sia's fans! It's great to be here.

860
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,031
DASHA TARAN, MODEL

861
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:36,300
I thought it would be better
to use my guest

862
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:38,269
in the first half of the livestream.

863
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:40,204
[Sia_jiwoo]
And when Dasha joined my live stream

864
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:44,075
the highest number of viewers
we had was around 9,000.

865
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:46,144
Mmm!

866
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:47,879
THE SPICINESS OF K-FOOD SO SPICY!

867
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:49,180
- Mmm.
- [Sia_jiwoo] So listen up…

868
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,015
It's way too spicy.

869
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,852
I really appreciate her being here.

870
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:55,753
Hiccups?

871
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,988
[snorts]

872
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:01,459
Really?

873
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:08,366
So I have a guest today
and it was really hard to get her here.

874
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:09,800
- Hi, there!
- Hello!

875
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:12,170
- Everyone, this is the actress Seorina.
- How are you?

876
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:13,137
Hi, everyone.

877
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:14,238
[DaeDo] Welcome! Welcome!

878
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:16,207
The commentators think you're beautiful.

879
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:18,176
The chat windows moving too fast.
Can you read it all?

880
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:19,977
Wait, are you supposed
to read all of those?

881
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:21,245
They're moving so fast

882
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:23,915
and I'm worried that you can't read
them like this, Seorina. Gosh.

883
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:24,815
OUR IN-A???????????

884
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:28,252
The chat window was moving super fast.

885
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:30,955
[DaeDo] Even with 20,000 people
it doesn't move that fast.

886
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:33,824
So, I was feeling flustered
at that moment.

887
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:38,596
- Oh. Welcome, welcome.
- Hi, there.

888
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:40,998
- I'm Lee Sang-ho, I'm a streamer.
- Oh, yes, welcome.

889
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:42,400
- I do gaming content.
- Oh.

890
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:45,570
Sang-ho is big on AfreecaTV.

891
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:47,972
He gets around 20,000 viewers

892
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,807
[OKING] I saw the number of viewers
was going up, 

893
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,310
and I was like, "This is a relief, 1,500."

894
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,745
No, you've got to believe me
it really happened.

895
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:57,081
I promise I'm not lying to you.

896
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:59,984
- Oh, what is this?
- What are you doing girl?

897
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:02,853
[Juice Seyeon] Hey, come here.

898
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,488
THAT GUY SHOULD PAY MORE TAXES

899
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,992
I also thought about inviting my guest
in the second half

900
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,895
but I decided to introduce them
in the first half

901
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:13,030
[Juice Seyeon]
so that I can maintain viewers.

- ♪ I've got nothing to say ♪
- [Sherry] Oh, no.

903
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,801
I messed up.

907
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:30,681
WHEN GUESTS JOINED THE STREAMS

908
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,884
Jin Yong-jin was being a troll as usual.

909
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:36,020
Some of my viewers in the chat said,

910
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,789
"You should watch Jin Yong-jin's
live stream instead."

911
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:42,627
[PaniBottle] I've always thought of him
as a player who understands

912
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:44,362
the intent of the game.

913
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,765
In this case, the game is influencing.
I feel it now too.

914
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:51,302
[Yong-jin]
So, ten minutes have gone by thus far.

915
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:54,605
Let's see how many viewers I have, 6,998…

916
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:56,240
7,005.

917
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,609
Okay, wow.

918
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:01,412
So, I'll tell you my income.

919
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:03,781
Oh, no. I'm nervous.

920
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:05,750
Here.

921
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:07,418
Do you see this?

922
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:10,488
Here you go.
This is my total monthly income.

923
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:13,391
So, there you have it.

924
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:14,792
WHERE DID YOU SPEND IT ALL?
WAIT, THAT'S IT?

925
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:15,960
Seriously?

926
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:18,929
I've actually known
this type of information

927
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:21,699
since I was an editor
what viewers are interested in,

928
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:24,035
how much money can I make from YouTube?

929
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:27,905
So, by targeting
people's primal curiosities

930
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,074
[Yong-jin]  I was able
to maintain viewer engagement

931
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,575
up until the very end.

932
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,211
But the most important thing
to know here is…

933
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:36,013
that I also receive incentives.

934
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:40,051
If you 8,000 viewers stick around
for a while I'll reveal my incentives.

935
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:43,187
Well, you'll find out later
if you hang around for a while.

936
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:45,690
"I'm going to be revealing something

937
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:48,926
even bigger than my monthly income
at 20 minutes."

938
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:53,030
You can ask me scandalous
and sensitive questions in the meantime.

939
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:56,167
And then every ten minutes
I'll answer one for your guys.

940
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:57,835
Trolling?

941
00:38:58,369 --> 00:38:59,737
Oh, come on guys.

that trolling's my job.

Since live streaming isn't my main focus
in the kind of content I create online

950
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:20,891
[GVAN] I invited all the best drag queens
in Korea to come here.

Hopefully, the guest will wow my viewers

952

Oh, my god, she's calling me right now!

What should I do?

1148
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:32,923
- Look, she's really calling.
- I don't know what you should do either.

Hmm.

1150
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,661
- I'm not answering.
- Don't do it. Don't answer her call now.

1151
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:40,130
Just message her and say, "Where are you?"

I watched your videos,
so I know how it goes.

- Are you busy? Oh, no, no!
- Oh, my gosh!

1157
00:46:49,406 --> 00:46:51,508
- [Ailee] "Why didn't you answer my call?"
- She's being kinda cold.

1158
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:53,744
- Aw, I think the way she talks…
- She keeps saying…

1159
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:54,912
…is adorable.

1160
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:57,848
Look, she's saying,
"I'm not… I'm not busy right now."

1161
00:46:57,915 --> 00:47:00,350
Oh, wow, I think it's going really well!

00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,256
Should we be upfront? Yeah.

1165
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,158
I'll tell her that there's someone I like.

1166
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:09,960
Okay.

- "So, I need your advice."
- [Ailee] That's good.

1169
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:17,100
Why am I the one
who's so nervous right now?

1170
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,635
Oh, my god, am I really doing this?

1171
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:20,370
My parents might see this, really.

1172
00:47:20,437 --> 00:47:22,773
We're so sorry,
my future son and daughter.

1173
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,442
If she says, yes, this might be the girl
I'll end up marrying.

1174
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,444
Oh my god,
am I really imagining our wedding?

1175
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:28,812
AILEE CAN SING AT HIS WEDDING LOL
GETTING MARRIED AFTER FOUR TEXTS

1176
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:30,047
She types so fast.

1177
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:31,081
AREN'T YOU THE ONE
WHO ASKS PEOPLE OUT FOR OTHERS?

1178
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:33,016
It's so awkward that
so many people are watching

1179
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:34,785
- you embarrassed yourself right now.
- Too many people are watching this.

1180
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,420
More viewers right now
than I thought there would be.

1181
00:47:36,486 --> 00:47:37,654
How many viewers do you have online?

1182
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:39,423
This is nuts. Right here.

1183
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:40,657
[Ailee] Oh, my goodness!

1184
00:47:40,724 --> 00:47:42,326
- There are almost 20,000 viewers…
- I know.

1185
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:43,227
…watching this.

1186
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:45,229
- "Where did you meet her?"
- "Is she a YouTuber?"

1187
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:48,265
I'm going to beat around the bush.
I'll crack a joke. She's…

1188
00:47:48,765 --> 00:47:51,168
- It's better to be more straightforward.
- [Junwoo] Yeah?

1189
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:53,337
Give her some hints instead
of beating around the bush.

1190
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:54,338
- Sounds good.
- Yeah.

1191
00:47:54,404 --> 00:47:56,206
Should I give her
some more hints right now?

1192
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:59,977
Yeah. Let's say, "There's this cute girl."
Or something like that.

1193
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:02,646
"Cute girl."

1194
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:05,983
[giggles, screams]

1195
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:07,317
It's so cringe!

1196
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:11,255
I'm really into her. I want to ask her
if she'll be my girlfriend.

1197
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:12,623
Try to make it happen.

1198
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:14,224
WAIT, DO YOU HAVE A CRUSH ON ME?

1199
00:48:16,026 --> 00:48:18,829
- [Ailee] Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
- What do I do? What do I do?

1200
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,797
- What do we do? What do we do?
- What do I do?

1201
00:48:20,864 --> 00:48:22,466
- It's so hot. It's getting hot in here!
- What do I do now?

1202
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:24,434
ANSWER HER RIGHT NOW
SAY YES

1203
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:28,005
Wow, this is nuts.
It's a crucial moment right now.

1204
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:30,440
[light music]

1205
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,111
I'm still literally shaking.

1206
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,146
Should I ask her out now?

1207
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:38,081
- What do you guys think?
- It's not the right time.

1208
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,317
"Be serious", that's what they're saying.

1209
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:43,687
But then there are other people who'll say
I have to be cute and casual as well.

1210
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:44,588
[Ailee] Right.

1211
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:47,224
- They say, "Say, yes." Ask her out.
- What should I do? Should I be serious

1212
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:49,059
- or should I be cute?
- "Do you want to go out with me?"

1213
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:50,160
Say something like that.

1214
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:51,995
- "Do you want to be my girlfriend?"
- Yeah.

1215
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:54,298
I'm going to do it. Okay.

1216
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:56,500
YOU'RE RIGHT, I LIKE YOU

1217
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:58,802
He did it! This is crazy!

1218
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:00,170
DO YOU WANT TO GO OUT WITH ME?

1219
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:02,773
[Ailee] Oh, my god, you sent it already?
Did you really?

1220
00:49:04,374 --> 00:49:05,809
Oh, my god! Don't read it right now.

1221
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:08,045
- [Ailee] I can't believe it.
- [Junwoo] Oh, shoot!

1222
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:09,479
[Ailee] Oh, my god, hold on.

1223
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:12,416
Whoa.

1224
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:15,118
DO YOU WANT TO GO OUT WITH ME?

1225
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:16,753
Will you answer me?

1226
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:18,622
- No, don't. Don't push.
- No, what? Push her.

1227
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:19,523
Oh, shoot!

1228
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:21,024
NO…
YOU PRESSURED HER

1229
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:22,526
- [Ailee] Oh, my goodness!
- Oh, no!

1230
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:23,961
- You should've waited.
- No! Oh, no.

1231
00:49:24,027 --> 00:49:25,295
- No way.
- I was too hasty.

1232
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:27,030
- She's going to reply.
- Oh, she just read the message.

1233
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:28,765
Whoa, do you think she'll say yes?

1234
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,667
- Wait, what?
- Do you have a girlfriend?

1235
00:49:30,734 --> 00:49:33,103
Why aren't you saying anything?
Oh, my god.

1236
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:35,105
[Junwoo] "A boyfriend." What?

1237
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:36,807
How did you guys know?

1238
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:40,377
[Yong-jin] It's officially
been 50 minutes. That's right.

1239
00:49:40,444 --> 00:49:41,545
Fifty minutes, people.

1240
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:44,281
So the earnings from my YouTube channel.

1241
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:47,884
How much is 93,000 US dollars?

1242
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,655
It's 120 million Korean won.

1243
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:53,824
Do I take the whole amount?
Of course, not.

1244
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:55,592
Wait, guys, please don't go right now.

1245
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:56,860
Wait, let me just say

1246
00:49:57,361 --> 00:49:58,929
it's been 50 minutes.

1247
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,664
But when it's been 56…

1248
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:02,899
AT 56 MINUTES I'LL REVEAL
SOMETHING MORE INTERESTING

1249
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:06,670
So, please stay tuned to find out.
I'll announce even bigger news soon.

1250
00:50:08,205 --> 00:50:10,140
I didn't expect it to go this way.

1251
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:12,943
I've never had 10,000 viewers
for my live stream

1252
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,545
except once I had to explain things
for Money Game.

1253
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:17,147
I wasn't worried at all.

1254
00:50:17,214 --> 00:50:20,150
But with TikTokers
and their followers, well…

1255
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:24,087
TikTokers aren't familiar
with live streaming.

1256
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:25,655
They're at a disadvantage here.

1257
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:26,556
TIME FOR THE GUEST TO LEAVE

1258
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:28,158
Everyone, I had so much fun
today with you.

1259
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:29,226
I did too.

1260
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:31,361
- Bye-bye, see you!
- Bye-bye!

1261
00:50:31,928 --> 00:50:33,130
I believe in you, Sia.

1262
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:35,699
[Sia_jiwoo] Dasha, no! Don't go!

1263
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:41,171
[suspenseful music]

1264
00:50:41,238 --> 00:50:44,041
- So the reason I was zoning out a little…
- [staff 1] Yeah.

1265
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:47,577
…was because I didn't know
what to do next.

1266
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:49,780
I had a lot of concerns
running through my head.

1267
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:53,316
TikTok is a platform
for short-form videos.

1268
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:56,253
So I wondered if the TikTokers
were going to win this.

1269
00:50:56,853 --> 00:50:57,954
Oh, man.

1270
00:50:58,021 --> 00:51:00,257
One hour is a super long time, huh?

1271
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,895
Uh, so let's see…

1272
00:51:04,961 --> 00:51:06,263
KEJIMIN
TIKTOK CREATOR

1273
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:08,031
Namaste. And…

1274
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:10,400
Ooh.

1275
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:13,370
[Ji-sou] You have to keep the ball rolling

1276
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:15,338
as much as you can
while you're doing a live stream.

1277
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:16,540
You can't just…

1278
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:19,042
do nothing.

1279
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:21,478
[KEJIMIN] I had no idea what to do.

1280
00:51:21,545 --> 00:51:25,315
I didn't want to be eliminated
but I thought my time had finally come.

1281
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:27,017
It's scary.

1282
00:51:27,617 --> 00:51:29,286
If you're not a fun person…

1283
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:33,090
you should be eliminated.
[laughs]

1284
00:51:33,156 --> 00:51:36,827
[host] One minute before the end
of the first half.

1285
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:38,795
So, you want to know what's going on here?

1286
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:40,230
You've got to stay tuned.

1287
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:43,166
I promise, I'll tell you all
what's been going on real soon.

1288
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:46,136

half of this live stream challenge my all.

00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:48,572
Thinking this was going to be
my only chance.

- [Changhyun] Great job, guys.

I can see how hard everyone tried.

- [DaeDo] Wow, look at that outfit
- It shows on their faces.

1308
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:23,573
- that you're wearing right now.
- Do I look wealthy?

1309
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,975
I'm pretty sure I did my best.

1310
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:26,543
You look like "Elsa" right now.

1311

- Oh, thank you so much.
- [CHAHONG] No, seriously you look great.

1312

You flatter me.

1314
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:37,354

[exclaims]

1316
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:44,161

00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:45,428
Oh, my god.

1318
00:52:45,962 --> 00:52:48,064
[DaeDo] I think Jang Keun-suk's the first.

1319
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:49,733
He has so many followers.

1320
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:52,135
It's going to be OKING, obviously.

1321
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:54,171
[PaniBottle] I'm afraid of OKING,

1322
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:56,606
Jin Yong-jin, and Jang Ji-sou.

1323
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,241
- [host] First…
- [Keun-suk] Come on.

1324
00:53:01,778 --> 00:53:03,280
- OKING.
- [Changhyun] Of course.

1ST PLACE, OKING
AVERAGE VIEWER COUNT: 16,979

1ST, OKING, STREAMER & YOUTUBER

was 16,979.

Oh, my gosh this is making me so nervous.

1367

[Keun-suk] If I'm in fifth place

[Eun-ji]
They're announcing the results now?

1384
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:15,445
Wow, this is rough.

1385
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:18,848
[iamkatiecutie] I always say,
"If you try to survive you will die."

1386
00:55:18,915 --> 00:55:20,450
And if you risk death you'll survive.

1387
00:55:20,517 --> 00:55:23,219

going to be eliminated

You don't usually live stream?

I thought something had really gone wrong.

00:56:30,186 --> 00:56:32,389
I never imagined that I come in 26th.

00:56:32,455 --> 00:56:35,725
I put so much effort into this.
I gave it my all.

1421
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:37,594
I really wanted to make it.

1422
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:40,196
It's heartbreaking
to be eliminated like this.

[host] Here is the ranking
for the first half of Round 2.

1438
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,498
I actually did way better
in that challenge

1439
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:17,333

Oh, really? Are you serious?

1443
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,608
[Junghyun]
But in the second round most of us

1444
00:57:25,675 --> 00:57:26,776
aren't going to have a guest there.

1445
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:29,345
[MyBoo] I bet we'll have less viewers
without the guest.

1446
00:57:29,412 --> 00:57:32,048
Geez, I don't want to get eliminated
second round. Ugh!

1447
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,117
- It would be terrible.
- I don't know what to do now.

1448
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:35,618
I haven't thought ahead.

1449
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:37,620
[iamkatiecutie] It's real now.

1450
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:39,422

- [KEJIMIN] That makes a lot of sense.

1454
00:57:45,895 --> 00:57:47,864
[RISABAE] I think I'm going
to go home today as well.

1455
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:50,200
- [CHAHONG] No, why do you think that?
- [RISABAE] I have a feeling.

- At least one of us should.
- No, I don't think

1459
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:56,306
I can compete with these people.

1460
00:57:56,372 --> 00:57:57,507
- Are they too strong?
- This will be the end

1461
00:57:57,574 --> 00:57:58,842
- of the beauty YouTuber.
- Well, we don't know that yet.

30 MINUTES LATER

1463
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:01,978
I'm so sorry.

1464
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:03,913
[sobs]

1465
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:06,382
[RISABAE] I was seriously confused.

1466
00:58:06,449 --> 00:58:08,384
It was a mix of emotions.

1467
00:58:08,451 --> 00:58:10,086
[Keun-suk] It was a misjudgment.

1468
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:12,922
My heart was racing,
and my hands were shaking.

1469
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:19,195
[Ji-sou] The result was something
I never saw coming.

1470
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:21,531
Turn it off! I can't do this!

1471
00:58:21,598 --> 00:58:23,500
I'm so embarrassed
to be on this show right now.

1472
00:58:23,566 --> 00:58:25,668
[Ji-sou]
And then I start to get really mad.

1473
00:58:25,735 --> 00:58:27,070
I was like, "Why am I here?"

1474
00:58:27,136 --> 00:58:28,905
Oh, hold on a second.
Hold on, guys. Hold on.

1475
00:58:28,972 --> 00:58:30,773

You got to do it now! Come on!

Oh, my goodness.

00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:35,178
We can do this. Come on, folks!

1479
00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:36,713
