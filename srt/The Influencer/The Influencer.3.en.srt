[host] Influencers,
prepare for the second half.

4
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,531
This excludes those who already survived

5
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:32,599
or were eliminated.

6
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:33,666
Let's do this.

7
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:36,036
Hey, get hyped.

8
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:39,773
I'll just do what I always do.
I'll try not to force anything.

[host] The five influencers
who survived the first half

10
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,111
can watch the second half from the lounge.

11
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:47,013
Oh, damn, I bet they're nervous.

12
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,182
Man, it looks so nerve-wracking.

13
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:52,185
[host] Influencers,

14
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:55,688
in the second half,
there will be a survivor

15
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:58,992
and an elimination every five minutes

16
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:01,494
after the live streaming starts.

17
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:08,001
One survivor
and one elimination every five minutes?

18
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,204
The humiliation, pressure. Wow.

00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:13,173
[RISABAE] Elimination's happening
every five minutes

20
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,542

with the highest viewer count

22
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,914

The influencer

24
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:24,818
will be eliminated.

25
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:25,985
Oh.

26
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:28,121
That's scary.

27
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:31,724

the star of one of my videos,

00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:08,294
it pulled in the most views.

During this second part of the livestream,

55
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:24,177
I'm thinking of paying more attention
to your energy levels,

00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,346

Yo, I'm going nuts!

No, guys.
It's the total opposite, everyone.

68
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,840
I thought,
"If I can't survive in the first half,

69
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,275
I'm gone in the second half."

70
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:59,779
I was really counting on my guest
to help me secure a spot in the top five,

71
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,249
but even with my guest's help,
I couldn't do it during the first half,

72
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:06,686
I didn't feel confident enough to beat
the others alone in the second half.

73
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,421
[Ji-sou] I was on the verge of giving up.

74
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,290
I've been live streaming for seven years,

75
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,125
but I've never been stressed out
like this before.

76
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,028
Ten minutes, please stay
for ten more minutes.

77
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:17,830
You know I've never begged you guys
for anything before, right?

78
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,735
How was your day, everyone?

79
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,904
I'm sure
everyone had a different experience,

80
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,973
but hopefully, you made good memories.

81
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,142
[Keun-suk]
I've done live streams on YouTube

82
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,411
and Instagram before.

83
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:33,846
I knew that I wouldn't be
in first or second,

84
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:35,582
or third or fourth place,

85
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:37,584
but if I could at least place fifth,

86
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,952
I thought I would be safe

87
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:40,820
and be able to make it to the next round.

88
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,323
But it didn't turn out the way I wanted.

89
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,960
I was so determined
and ready to put in everything I've got

90
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:50,396
in the second half,
but then I thought about it, "No, no."

91
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:52,465
I didn't want to burden my followers

92
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:55,535
with my situation
and my frustration in any way.

93
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,706
Instead, I just decided
to wrap up today in a nice way.

94
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:01,708
[Keun-suk]
So I quickly reorganized the set

95
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:03,209
and cleaned everything up.

96
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:06,346
I asked the staff
to adjust the lighting to a warmer color,

97
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,549
which was perfect
for making a toast to wrap up the day.

98
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:12,485
I might move around a little bit,
so I'll keep that in mind.

99
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,055
Hello, guys.

100
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:19,792
It's such a wonderful night.
I hope you had a great day today.

101
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:22,362
I'm sorry. Sorry, I apologize.

102
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,097
I brought this from home

103
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:28,334
as I know it's been a long day for you,
and I thought it would be a good idea

104
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,803
to have a drink with you all
in the second half.

105
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,273

- [Junwoo] She's calling us over.

112
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:47,053
- Oh, my, look at that.
- Who is that?

113
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,489
- Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
- [PaniBottle] What, what?

114
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:51,691
It's Pyo Eun-ji.
She just took off her clothes.

115
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,359
- [PaniBottle] What?
- [Junwoo] Woah, that's a lot.

116
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:54,894

117
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,297
- That's crazy. Is that right?
- She's doing a lookbook?

118
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:59,132
- [Juice Seyeon] Wow. 2,300 viewers.
- A lookbook?

119
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:01,234
[Juice Seyeon] Lookbook content
is something she usually does.

121
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,570
Hi, everyone. Hello.

122
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,773
[upbeat music]

123
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:09,175
Hello, my name is Pyo Eun-ji.

124
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:12,845
[Eun-ji] I currently work as a model
in both Japan and Korea.

125
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:18,451
I have about 1.95 million subscribers
on my YouTube channel.

126
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:20,787
Before starting my career as a model,

127
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:22,588
I was working at an investment firm.

128
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,590
I majored in accounting.

129
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:25,658
I know I don't look it,

130
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:28,695
but I used to work
as a corporate employee.

131
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:35,001
You know, I have sort of this like,
girl next door vibe and image about me.

132
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:39,439
But I do mostly sexy content,
and it's become my unexpected charm.

133
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,845
So today, I'm going to be giving
a live lookbook a try.

134
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,413
My first live one.

135
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,516
Hurry and show up, everybody.
Come join me!

136
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:54,387
[Eun-ji] So I brought some of the outfits
from the lookbook videos,

137
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,923
which got the most views
out of all of them.

138
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:01,761
I've never done a lookbook live before,
so I wasn't feeling very confident.

139
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:05,164
Because I had to get a lot of viewers
in a short amount of time.

140
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:07,266
[Eun-ji] I decided to use that
as my cheat code.

141
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:11,404
And luckily, I got a lot of support
from my Taiwanese fans.

142
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:15,274
[exciting music]

143
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:17,443
All right.

144
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:21,414
I wore this recently
and a lot of people loved it.

145
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,182
I got a lot of views.

146
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:25,084
[Eun-ji] One million views.

147
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:28,354
This outfit was in one of the videos
that got one million views.

148
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:29,622
Yes!

149
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:30,656
WHO GOES TO WORK LIKE THAT? LOL

150
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,125
Thank you, guys.

151
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,659
[Eun-ji] You guys are saving me.

152
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:37,597
You guys,
you guys are really saving my life.

153
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:38,598
How do I look?

154
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,800
I LOVE IT
WHERE DID ALL THESE PEOPLE COME FROM?

155
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,368
The office look.

156
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:48,374
I'm getting a lot
of nice compliments on this.

157
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:50,309
SO PRETTY

158
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:51,444

159
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:52,678
Next.

160
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,814
[Juice Seyeon] Look,
the viewer count keeps going up.

161
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,116
- That's crazy.
- Wow, who's that?

162
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,886
[Yong-jin] Oh, the fortune-telling content
is no joke.

in your birthday than your name.

I'm Youtuber Dohwadore.

167
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,898
If you search "Four Pillars of Destiny"
on YouTube,

168
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:13,166
I'm at the top of the results.

169
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,803
[Dohwadore] I think I might be
the first YouTuber to teach people

170
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:19,272
how to analyze their own fortune.

171
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:20,673
Since it's the new year,

172
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,943
I'm going to talk
about love fortunes for 2024.

00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,446
And I know it's something
that everyone's interested in,

174
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:29,048
so I was confident
that I would be in the upper ranks.

175
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,983
Love fortunes are interesting this year.

176
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,686
I have 2,833 viewers.

177
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:36,789
Hey, wake up.
Dohwadore is talking about love fortunes.

178
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:40,426
Bring your grandpa, grandma,
mom, dad, ex-boyfriend, ex-girlfriend.

179
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:41,327
Bring 'em all.

180
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:42,929
I'm going to discuss potential events

181
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:45,798
that could occur
in your love life in 2024.

182
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,133
I came well-prepared.

183
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,270
I'll also be letting you know
who's in for good luck in love in 2024,

184
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:54,273
and who might face challenges
or the possibility of a breakup.

185
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,142
The reason why this is important

186
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,644
is that you have to look
into both partners' fortune.

187
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:01,347
Because, obviously,
you can't love by yourself, right?

188
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:05,885
Let's say you have good luck for love,
but the person you're with has bad luck.

189
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,620
How do you think that would play out?

190
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:10,256
Everyone, please write your guess
in the comments?

191
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,158
WOULD ONE PERSON INITIATE A BREAKUP?
IT WOULD END BADLY?

192
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,226
That's correct.

193
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:14,794
When you have good luck in love,

194
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:17,797
there's a chance that you might
fall in love too easily or be blinded.

195
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,699
And if your partner has bad luck,

196
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:22,001
they might be
overly cautions towards love.

197
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:24,437
Ultimately, you would probably
end up taking on the role

198
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,405
of the giver in that relationship.

199
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:29,342
If you're aware of these kinds of things,

200
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:32,345
you can become the Zhuge Liang
of relationships matters.

201
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:34,146
I'M SORRY

202
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:37,450
Everyone, hello. I'm back again.

203
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,853
Hello, I'm BBOGUMI, and I'm a streamer.

204
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:45,191
I extort money from a lot of men
on Twitch and YouTube.

205
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,360
Hi. Hello.

206
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,397
Did you forget? I'm a girl. A girl!
Tell me that I'm pretty.

207
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:54,400
Huh? Tell me that I'm pretty.
I'm pretty, right? Tell me.

208
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,669
Give me your money, I'm pretty!

209
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,438
SO SHINY

210
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:01,607
No, seriously. It's pissing me off!

211
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:04,010
I really think
my viewers have the most fun

212
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,078
when they get to make fun of me.

213
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:09,015
I'm going to go full troll
to get more attention today.

214
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:12,919
[BBOGUMI] Once I've got enough attention,
I'll give myself some kind of punishment.

215
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:15,421
I'll make a list, nothing too crazy,

216
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:17,156
and then spin the roulette.

217
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,026
I've got some viewers,
so I'm going to spin the roulette.

218
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:22,328
What is it?

219
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,930
[tense music]

220
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:24,964
COME ON, JUMP ROPE ON GRAVEL
RUBBING YOUR EYES WITH LEMON

221
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,832
You all have been itching for this, huh?

222
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,201
Three, two, one.

223
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,973
THROW STRAWBERRY POWDER, FLOUR,
AND WATER MIXTURE ON FACE

224
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:39,312
"Mix strawberry powder, flour, and water
and throw it in your face."

225
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:40,713
What am I even doing?

226
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,849
Three, two, one.

227
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,325
LOL

228
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,427
YOU LOOK LIKE A HOPPFISH

229
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:57,797
If I get eliminated after this,
I'm burning this place down.

230
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:01,767
Today, I'm going to announce
something important.

231
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:05,371
If you guys want to keep watching me,
I need more people to show up.

232
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,541
To entice you, I've prepared
a couple of things for you guys.

233
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,377
I think Jin Yong-jin nim
and PaniBottle nim

234
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,213
understand how to utilize
the most important aspect of the game.

235
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,882
[DaeDo] They write titles like,
"I have a big announcement"

236
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,751
or "I'm going to delete my channel."

237
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,953
I thought "Oh, they came on strong!"

238
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,789
[DaeDo] So I decided to copy them
and used a clickbait title

239
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:25,524
like "Big Announcement".

240
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:30,062
So, the first important announcement is…

241
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,332
My fandom gets a new name,
"DaeViewers" to "DaeWarriors."

242
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,702
So from now on, DaeDo's
new fandom name is "DaeWarriors."

243
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,104
I hope you like the new name.

244
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,539
And the next big announcement…

245
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:45,044
You know, I announced my divorce
sometime around the middle of last year.

246
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,313
It wasn't actually a bad breakup at all.

247
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,715
I'm not saying
I'm definitely going to date someone,

248
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:51,884
but you know, maybe,
around the end of the year,

249
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:52,918
I just assume that.

250
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:53,986
A SELF-REVEAL OMG
A PLANNED SCANDAL LOL

251
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,788
I'll probably be seeing someone.

252
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:58,658
And now I'm going to move on
to my next announcement.

253
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,693
You see, I have rhinitis.

254
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,095
The symptoms are pretty serious,
as you might have noticed,

255
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,230
I can't stop sniffing.

256
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:08,534
So, I might consider getting
rhinitis surgery sometime this year.

257
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,703
Just wanted to let all of you know that.

258
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:11,637
IT MUST BE HARD TO COME UP
WITH BOGUS BIG ANNOUNCEMENTS

259
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:13,906
No, I'm not making it up. I'm not.

260
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:16,242
I'm just sharing
all my most recent news with you.

261
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:17,309
The big announcement.

262
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:18,511
HOW MANY ANNOUNCEMENTS ARE THERE?
ARE THERE 10 MORE LEFT?

263
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:19,745
"How many is that?"

264
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,080
"How many more, like ten?"

265
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,517
Should I try the Spiderman outfit next?

266
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,852
Oh, I thought I had enough time,
maybe not.

267
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,321
I'd better hurry because I have no idea

268
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:30,589
when this thing will shut off.

269
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,391
- How much time left?
- That surprised me.

270
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,026
- Hey, look.
- What now?

271
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:36,328

What was that sound? What was that sound?

276

Hold on a sec, hold on a sec.
Wait, hold on a sec.

277
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,842
Just a moment, I think
they're announcing something important.

278
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,877
I'm scared. What's this?

279
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:53,579
I think I'm getting kicked out.

280
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:55,881
I think I'm going home.

281
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:58,050
Not me, is it? Wait. Not me, right?

282
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,485

there was a monitor next to me.

Not even once.

sitting right there the whole time,

to even notice it.

I felt so sorry for those

Because they won't even be able
to say goodbye.

- [Keun-suk] Wow.

512
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:48,607
- Everybody here's so desperate.
- [Juice Seyeon] 1,770 viewers?

513
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:50,842
For this round,
being an attention seeker is a skill.

514
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:52,411

Right now, I'm--

00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:00,852

The difference between them
is only 10 or 20 people.

"Roll the chat wheel.
We're shooting a Netflix show!"

[Ji-sou]
I started getting mad out of the blue.

00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,719
I talked about how I felt
filming the show.

558
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:44,022
I didn't try to clickbait title,
and went with "My honest opinion."

559
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,691
That's it. Let's just see how it goes.

560
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,593
"My Honest Opinion." Okay.

561
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:50,829
That much I can do.

562
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:53,231
"Discuss with Netflix?"
What's there to say?

563
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:54,433
Turn off the camera.

The one in front of me,
this one, and that one. Off.

565
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,973
I'll pay the penalty.
You can blur my face.

566
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,176
I'm embarrassed
to be on this kind of show.

567
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,645
[PaniBottle] Oh! Jang Ji-sou got a bunch.

- [OKING] How many?
- [PaniBottle] 700.

569
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:10,315
- [Juice Seyeon] That's one way to do it.
- [PaniBottle] His numbers are rising.

570
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:13,552
He changed the title.
"My Honest Opinion on Netflix."

[Sia_jiwoo] I got eliminated.

And at the time, I had 224 viewers.

I've never seen a number even that low

[staff] Oh, wow.

581
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:52,624
One of my viewers from overseas
kept saying the F-word in the comments.

582
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:54,659
- [staff] Oh my.
- And I had to delete them.

583
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:58,864
[Sia_jiwoo] So I was trying to figure out
how to delete the comments when…

584

- That's amazing.
- What's he talking about now?

599
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:56,354
He's going off on Netflix.

600
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:58,557
So, they put all these creators together.

601
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:00,058
We're not doing it for the money,

602
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,093
because it's Netflix and we trust them.

603
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,261
But we come here and…

604
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:06,298
We have to go aggro as hard as we can,

605
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:08,600
make all the content
we might use in the future.

606
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:11,369
No sponsors, we can't share on YouTube.

Come on, come here. Get a grip!

608
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,775
If they make me do this again
in the next round,

609
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:18,710
I'm not gonna do it. Seriously.

610
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:19,978
SAY IT LOUDER
JI-SOU'S GOING ALL OUT

611
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:23,148
[Ji-sou] I had like 200 viewers
at the beginning,

612
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:27,986
but when I started criticizing Netflix,
it shot up to 800 or like 1,000.

613
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:30,021
Ah, this is it.

614
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,390
How much longer? End it.

615
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,359

616
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,228
This is why you watch? Seriously?

617
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:39,898
That's enough. Shut the camera off.

618
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:42,734
Do you think I can do this again?

619
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:45,870
If you… If you all can help me, I…

620
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,840
Do you think I can make it? Huh?

621
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:53,745
[RISABAE] I think my followers
are a totally different demographic

622
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:56,247
from the demographic of other influencers.

623
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:58,583
They've been with me for such a long time.

624
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:01,586
It was already past bedtime
for most of my followers.

625
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:03,989
And I've never live streamed before
at such a late hour.

626
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:05,390

I know, my little ladies and gentlemen
prefer daytime, right?

629

Those who are still here with me

630
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:18,003
are probably doing your best
to not fall asleep, right? Okay?

631
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:20,472
Should we wake them up?
How can we do that?

632
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:24,876
I wish I could wake everyone up
and have your support, just for today.

633
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,113
Should I change the title?
Change it to what?

634
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:31,282
Like, "Thank you for everything so far"?

635
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:33,518
Okay, we have "Begging with Tears."

636
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:38,456
"Bye Now." sounds too serious though,
like I'm saying goodbye for good.

637
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:39,557
WHAT ABOUT "MY LAST REQUEST"?

638
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:42,027
Really? "One last favor"?

639
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:47,565
I've never used that kind of title,
not even once.

640
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:52,437
A lot of my viewers were saying
that I should try something different,

641
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,472
something I don't usually do,

642
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:57,575
like changing
my stream title or thumbnail.

643
00:27:57,642 --> 00:28:00,111
Honestly, I almost gave up,

644
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:04,849
but it seemed like my viewers
were not quite ready to give up yet.

645
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:06,885

YOU USUALLY GO TO BED?

I'm not gonna be able to sleep.

I'm not going to sleep now."

00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,152
Yes, of course, you can do that.

DON'T CRY

DON'T FEEL SORRY
WHO MADE YOU CRY?

DON'T CRY
JUST LEAVE IT ON WHILE YOU SLEEP

I'm so sorry. [sniffles]

"Can I doze off
while keeping it on, Unni?"

669
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:26,397

8TH, RISABAE, SURVIVED
LAST COUNT: 2,125 VIEWERS

678
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:07,272
Oh no, it disconnected.

679
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:08,506
13TH, IAMKATIECUTIE, ELIMINATED
LAST COUNT: 700 VIEWERS

680
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:09,874
Eliminated.

681
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:12,777
- [iamkatiecutie] RISABAE nim!
- Yes?

682
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:14,445
- You cried?
- [RISABAE] Yes.

683
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:16,881
Why are you crying? Oh, Unni.

684
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:19,317
[iamkatiecutie] Oh no, don't cry.
It’s all right.

685
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,521
[RISABAE sniffles]

686
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,560
- [Dohwadore] RISABAE, you worked so hard.
- [RISABAE] Hey.

687
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:29,460
Thank you.

688
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:31,362
[Changhyun] Same here, I cried too.

689
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:33,898
I cried. It's okay.
You're good. You did great.

690
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:36,067
- [Changhyun] I can relate to you.
- [DaeDo] Right.

691
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:39,737
My viewers,
they tried so incredibly hard to help me.

692
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:43,341
They tried to stay awake.
They stayed up for me.

693
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:45,343
That proves how good you've been
to your fanbase.

694
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,644
- [Juice Seyeon] Yeah, that's right.
- He's right.

695
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:48,079
[BBOGUMI]
All my viewers were saying I'm a goner.

696
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:50,181
[RISABAE] I was thankful
and felt bad at the same time.

697
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:52,817
- BBOGUMI cried.
- BBOGUMI shaved an eyebrow.

698
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:54,853
Did you really shave it off? Look at you.

699
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:56,387
[RISABAE] I'll draw it back.
No one will notice.

700
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:58,456
[BBOGUMI] Please draw it on for me
in your next stream.

701
00:30:58,523 --> 00:30:59,958
Of course, I'll draw you two.

702
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:04,362
[Ji-sou] Am I the only one left?

703
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,198
Wait. Why can't I hear anyone?

704
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,702
Why am I still live, huh?

705
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:12,937
I was just going to say
whatever I had to say

706
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:14,439
and be eliminated.

707
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:15,874
But people around me are like,

708
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,175
"Hey, you're going on Netflix?

709
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:18,810
Dude, you've succeeded in life.

710
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,646
Wow, you're world-class, world-class."

711
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,114
World-class, my ass.

712
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:24,949
More like, "What the hell
am I even doing here?

713
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:26,017
ISN'T IT LIKE, THE ONE WHO HOLDS OUT
THE LONGEST WINS?

714
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,919
"The one who holds out the longest wins?"

715
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:29,821
Who knows?
My monitor is still facing the wall.

716
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,123
I don't even know
why mine hasn't shut off.

717
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,157
Winner?

718
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:36,294
I think they all went home
and forgot I'm still here doing this.

719
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:38,630
YOU'RE OUT
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE ON AFREECATV

720
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:39,664
"Out"?

721
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:40,665
EVERYONE'S GONE

722
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,600
Out? Am I really the only one left now?

723
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:45,737
Am I the only one on AfreecaTV
with this background?

724
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,308
Ah…

725
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,011
YES, YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE LEFT

726
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,212
I'm the last one left?

727
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,748
I refuse to do this.

728
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,751
I'm going to review
Disney Plus content now.

729
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:02,086
PLEASE DO IT
THAT'S A BOLD MOVE

730
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:04,022
IT'LL GET EDITED OUT
SHUT HIM UP!

731
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:06,324
You know,
I'm more into Disney Plus these days.

732
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:07,458
Coupang Play.

733
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:09,494
Bring it on. Let's see who wins.

734
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,795
Let's take a look.

735
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:13,364
I'm just gonna watch
Coupang Play right now.

736
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,500
I'm going to take a dump right here.

737
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:17,702
[laughing]

738
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:20,972
- He's freaking funny.
- I know, right?

739
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,308
- Yeah. Damn right.
- Jang Ji-sou's just… Yeah.

740
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:27,078
If the number of viewers goes up,
I'll keep spinning without breaks.

741
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:30,248
Since you're already here,
please type "JSU" in the comment.

742
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:31,582
I want a dopamine rush

743
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:33,384
from seeing the screen
filled with "Ji-sou, Up".

744
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,353
JSU

745
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,854
My energy is filling up.

746
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:37,889
Everyone.

747
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:38,856
GATO
TIKTOK CREATOR

748
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:40,024
Focus!

749
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:41,259
[GATO] This is so intense.

750
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:43,795
I really don't want to be
the last one standing.

751
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:46,164
"This is speed game, right?"

752
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,566
Nepal, Nepal, Nepal… Where is it?

753
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,268
[KEJIMIN]
My heart was pounding like crazy.

754
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:51,836
I was super desperate.

755
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,972
- What?
- Wait…

756
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:55,940
THE STREAM HAS ENDED

757
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:58,876
I survived.

758
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:01,913
9TH, JANG JI-SOU, SURVIVED
LAST COUNT: 1,706 VIEWERS

759
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,981
That's a relief.

760
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:07,251
[PaniBottle] Jang Ji-sou ended up
having 1,700 viewers.

761
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,420
- [OKING] I can't believe this.
- That guy is amazing.

762
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:12,190
I think Jang Ji-sou
is the star of Round Two.

763
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:14,959
He went into
the Hyperbolic Time Chamber by himself.

764
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:16,728
The numbers went way up.

765
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:19,530
I almost got eliminated
before the rant about Netflix.

766
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:20,832
I was criticizing Netflix

767
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:22,734
while just casually talking
like a story time.

768
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,535
Please help me.

769
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:26,537
Ten minutes. Please stay for ten.

770
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:28,873
If they make me do this again
in the next round…

771
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,475
We're not doing it for the money,

772
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:32,343
because it's Netflix and we trust them.

773
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,078
If you think anything
with the Netflix name

774
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:35,146
is just going to work…

775
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:37,448
Come on, come here, get a grip!

776
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,217
[Ji-sou]
People actually really liked that.

777
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:41,819
The viewer numbers
suddenly start rising like crazy.

778
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:44,422
So, I'm back from the brink of death.

779
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:46,691
[GATO] This is tough.

780
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,192
12TH, GATO, ELIMINATED
LAST COUNT: 682 VIEWERS

781
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:50,862
- Wow, but GATO nim and…
- Exactly.

782
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:52,697
[Juice Seyeon]
The top ranks were eliminated.

783
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:54,399
All the TikTokers were eliminated?

784
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:55,533
I think so.

785
00:33:57,835 --> 00:33:59,437
[influencers exclaim]

786
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:01,239
Good job, man.

787
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:02,573
- [Juice Seyeon] Ji-sou…
- What's up?

788
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,575
- …your stream was super funny.
- We all watched your stream

789
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:05,476
Oh, shit.

790
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:08,613
Hey, even when you had
only 200 viewers, PaniBottle was…

791
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,782
It's so much. I'm gonna cry now.

792
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:12,083
I thought you did. Not yet?

793
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,451
[OKING] We all cried already.

794
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:16,587
This was the most challenging live stream
I've ever done, seriously.

795
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:17,522
[Changhyun] I knew you'd say that.

796
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:18,890
[DaeDo] How much time?

797
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,895
[exclaims]

798
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:26,097
What is this?

799
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:28,599
What's happening now? I'm so scared.

800
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:30,902
At that moment, I couldn't breathe.

801
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:34,605
Oh, man, this is bad. I'm done for.

802
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:38,409
Hey, folks. I'll do the burpee test
until I have 10,000 viewers.

803
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:41,579
After I saw who I was up against,
my mind started racing.

804
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:44,215
I'll keep going for more views.

805
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:46,084
Don't leave me, guys.

806
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,653
[host] Ten seconds
until the end of the second half.

807
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,987
Don't leave me!

808
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:50,955
Oh, my God.

809
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,590
Peru? I got the flag.

810
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,892
[suspenseful music swells, fades]

811
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:57,695
[dings]

812
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,364
[host] The second half is now over.

813
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,834
Over? [breathes sharply]

814
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:06,437
Did I lose? Hurry, tell me.

815
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:08,840
10TH, KEJIMIN, SURVIVED
11TH, DOCTOR WHO, ELIMINATED

816
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:09,807
[Juice Seyeon] KEJIMIN?

817
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:11,542
[DaeDo]
Why is Doctor Who getting eliminated?

818
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,877
KEJIMIN turned the tables.

819
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,112
Woah.

820
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:16,581
I win with just a 60-viewer difference?

821
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:17,515
Really?

822
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:19,450
Look who's made it out alive.

823
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:23,087
I'm the only TikToker who survived.

824
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:24,188
11TH, DOCTOR WHO, ELIMINATED
LAST COUNT: 821 VIEWERS

825
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:28,726
It was close, 885 to 821 is super close.

826
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,428
I got too desperate.

827
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:32,697
I didn't have any more content to show,

828
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:35,166
so I ended up being
pretty one-dimensional.

829
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:36,601
Yeah.

830
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:38,336
It's disappointing.

831
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:40,872
Much respect to those
who do live streams regularly.

832
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:44,809
Being an influencer
isn't just about posting videos.

833
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:48,212
Doing live streams
can also be a popular content.

834
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:52,316
On this show, I picked up on areas
where I was lacking and learned from them.

835
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:56,287
Actually, I haven't been able
to be very active lately.

836
00:35:56,354 --> 00:36:00,825
[WETBOY] So when my followers came in
and said "I missed you, WETBOY."

837
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:03,094
That's almost made me cry.

838
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:07,732
Knowing that there are
people waiting for me.

839
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:09,567
Mm, that made me so happy.

840
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:13,337
It's been seven years
since I first debuted.

841
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:16,107
I had mixed feelings, like…

842
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:20,912
[GVAN] At the beginning,
there were people who dismissed me,

843
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:24,115
but now I'm shooting with Netflix.

844
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,685
And I have 500 people watching my stream.

845
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:29,520
It was… [sniffles]

846
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:35,393
Well, I sort of thought about all that
when the lights went off.

847
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:39,997
I'm a drag queen, and I'm queer and gay.

848
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:44,602
But at the same time,
I see myself as an incredible influencer,

849
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:48,039
proud to be able to be myself
in front of everyone.

850
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:51,108
Deny me and you will meet your demise!

851
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:53,411
- [upbeat music]
- [laughing]

852
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,887
[host] Round Two survivors,

853
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:04,755
congratulations.

854
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:08,793
I will now announce the rankings
of your worth for this round.

855
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:11,629
[BBOGUMI] MyBoo is in first place.

856
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:14,398
[KEJIMIN]
She has more than 70 million won. 70?

857
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:16,200
[Eun-ji] MyBoo is number 1?

858
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:18,236
[MyBoo]
So the girl who was walking next to me,

859
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:20,371
what's her name, Sia_jiwoo nim?

860
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:22,440
Isn't she the one who was in first place?

861
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:25,343
[MyBoo] 77.64 million won?

862
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,644
[Ji-sou] I looked up at the screen,

863
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:28,379
and the numbers
were just ridiculously high.

864
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:29,880
I ended up in third place.

865
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:31,215
I'm sorry, GATO.

866
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:33,351
I'll eat well.

867
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,052
[host] The VIP for Round Two

868
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,922
is the influencer
with the highest worth, MyBoo.

869
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:40,124
In second place, KEJIMIN.

870
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:42,893
Third place is supposed to be a VIP.

871
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,563
Doesn't VIP include
the third-place winner too?

872
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:48,432
[host] I will now reveal
the mission for the third round.

873
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:50,768
- Wow, the important one.
- [Juice Seyeon] Oh, no, I'm…

874
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:52,436
Please, anything but Shorts.

875
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:56,107
[host] Round Three is about showcasing
your ability as an influencer

876
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:58,509
to captivate the attention of others

877
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:00,511
through the creation of a photo feed.

878
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:02,713
Oh my god. Photos? So, it's Instagram.

879
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,983
- Oh, no! I'm a goner for sure.
- [Eun-ji] Oh, no.

880
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,318
[RISABAE] A photo?

881
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:09,387
We all thought it was going to be
a short-form video,

882
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:12,857
because it's not very easy
to get likes for photos these days.

883
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:16,260
I think that's what makes
this mission more difficult.

884
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:18,162
[DaeDo] I was surprised to hear that.

885
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:21,365
A photo? That's kind of… [laughs]

886
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:22,667
I don't know what to do.

887
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:26,203
As soon as
the Photo Feed Creation was announced,

888
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:29,073
a lot of the guys sigh like, "Ah…"

889
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,176
Since I do cosplay
and edit the photos by myself,

890
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:34,011
I'm confident with the mission.

891
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:37,515
This mission seems to be worrying
all the guys.

892
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:40,484
[Eun-ji] I think, since the guys
don't have the right appeal,

893
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:42,453
the girls would have a slight advantage.

894
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,522
Like me. [laughs]

895
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:48,526
THE INFLUENCER

896
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:51,062
[suspenseful music]

897
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:52,263
[dings]

898
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:07,144
ROUND 3
15 SURVIVORS LEFT

899
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:08,846
[Ji-sou] What's that?
A claw machine or something?

900
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:11,048
- [Eun-ji] What's that?
- [OKING] What's this? What's this?

901
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:12,483
- There's a glass box.
- [chuckles]

902
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,951
- A circle?
- [whoops]

903
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,953
[Eun-ji] Are we going
to take photos in that cube?

904
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,022
[DaeDo] It looks like
something is going to fall inside it.

905
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:20,391
Do we go inside one by one for the photo?

906
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:23,227
- We might be locked inside.
- [Ji-sou groans]

907
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:27,098
One of those cubes,
where people go in and fill it with water.

908
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:29,333
- [Juice Seyeon] What are you saying?
- We have to survive 19 minutes.

909
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,534
[Ji-sou] And they drop cockroaches.

910
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:33,971
I think we have to take a photo
of someone inside the cube.

911
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:36,607
I shouldn't have worn this outfit then.

912
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:39,076
We might be voting amongst ourselves.

913
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:40,344
Oh.

914
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:42,813
Maybe there, there will be a time limit,

915
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,649
and we'll have to take turns
for the photo, like…

916
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:48,352
Right. I can't predict it at all.

917
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:50,588
Wow, I really have no idea.

918
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:52,256
Oh, I'm so curious what it could be.

919
00:39:53,391 --> 00:40:00,231
[host] Welcome, to the 15 who made it
to Round Three of The Influencer.

920
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:01,332
Let's go!

921
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:04,001
[host] In Round Three,

922
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:09,073
out of all of you,
only eight influencers will survive.

923
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,609
- That's half of us.
- [DaeDo] They're sending away half?

924
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:14,145
This round

925
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:16,647
is a team battle with teams of two.

926
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:19,083
- Two people together?
- Teams of two?

927
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,184
Oh, my goodness.

928
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,052
[PaniBottle]
The next mission is photography.

929
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:26,123
And you know, you can never underestimate
the power of the image that women have.

930
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,658
[Junwoo] I'm thinking the women…

931
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:30,261
[OKING] I think
it's gonna be centered around the women.

932
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:32,897
[host] Before the mission starts,

933
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:34,832
we'll have an auction…

934
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:37,802
We'll have an auction
to pair up into teams.

935
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:39,637
[all exclaiming, laughing]

936
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:42,907
A human auction?
I never even imagined something like this.

937
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:45,309
- [DaeDo] We get to use this cash?
- We get to use our money.

938
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:46,277
We're using our money.

939
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:50,514
[Ji-sou] Finally, the day has come
to spend the money I'm worth.

940
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:52,583
Now the real fight begins.

941
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,453
[Yong-jin] They're making us fight
with this… this worth of ours.

942
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:57,855
Matters of money are always sensitive.

943
00:40:57,922 --> 00:40:59,790
[Dohwadore]
I feel like things can get intense today.

944
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:02,660
People can get emotional
when it comes to their fortune.

945
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:07,431
[host] Influencers will go
into the auction cube one by one.

946
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:10,968
You will go in the order
of least to most worth.

947
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:12,069
[all exclaim]

948
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,572
15TH, DOHWADORE

949
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,541
[Dohwadore] It was nerve-racking
to be the first item up for auction

950
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:19,477
among those 15 people.

951
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:21,111
This makes me sad.

952
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:22,580
I'm second.

953
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:25,850
[Keun-suk] The fact that I can buy someone
and be sold by others…

954
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:27,284
Wow, that's really…

955
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:28,652
[Junwoo] I didn't want to go up.

956
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:30,688
What would I do when I got in there?

957
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:32,623
I also slightly felt it was cruel.

958
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,259
[PaniBottle] It's pretty brutal,
but that's how survival games work.

959
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,160
8TH, PANIBOTTLE

960
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:39,096
[host] Influencers who want to form a team

961
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,098
with those in the auction cube

962
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:46,604
can participate in the auction
by spending their own worth.

963
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,205
Wow, I never saw this coming.

964
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:51,675
[host] The influencer who offers
the highest amount among them

965
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:56,046
will win the bid for the influencer
inside the auction cube.

966
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:58,048
[Yong-jin] What took me by surprise

967
00:41:58,115 --> 00:42:00,417
was that it was already sort of decided

968
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:03,387
who gets to buy and who gets bought.

969
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:06,090
[host] However,
if no one makes the purchase,

970
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:11,495
the influencer will be considered unsold
and must return to the auction cube

971
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:13,464
when their turn comes around again.

972
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,332
Oh, wow, you can go unsold?

973
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:19,436
[host] Any influencer who remains
without a team at the end of the round

974
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:21,972
- will be eliminated.
- [all exclaim]

975
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,709
- [DaeDo] I knew it!
- [RISABAE] No way, that's too harsh.

976
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:27,478
That's so mean.

977
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:28,946
Let's go then.

978
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:33,050
[host] Dohwadore,
who currently has the lowest worth…

979
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:34,084
15TH, DOHWADORE
FORTUNE TELLING YOUTUBER

980
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:36,487
…please step into the auction cube.

981
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,422
- [Juice Seyeon] No, this is too cruel.
- Wow.

982
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:40,357
Awesome. What do I do?

983
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:42,993
[BBOGUMI] Oh, this feels gross.

984
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,229
[RISABAE]
This is weird and really strange.

985
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:47,131
[BBOGUMI] This is, like, really cruel.

986
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:49,266
This is pretty extreme.

987
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:53,871
[Eun-ji] Since Dohwadore nim's content
isn't about himself…

988
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:57,074
[PaniBottle] Because it's just a photo,
no audio or videos.

989
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:59,443
[MyBoo] I assumed for him
that he didn't have much knowledge

990
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:00,711
about photo feeds.

991
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:03,247
[Keun-suk]
Honestly, I thought Dohwadore nim's

992
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:05,416
had the highest chance
of being eliminated.

993
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:10,688
[Changhyun] Dohwa nim, can you hear me?

994
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:11,789
Oh, I think he can.

995
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:15,225
[Dohwadore] I thought,
"I just want to get this over with.

996
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:18,028
I feel like an animal locked up in a cage
and I hate this feeling."

997
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:21,165
And what made it worse
was that I was the first one.

998
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:24,568
If I buy someone before my turn,
I don't have to go up?

999
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:26,270
That's right. You're a team, yeah.

1000
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:30,140
[host] We'll now begin the first auction.

1001
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:31,542
[Changhyun exclaims]

1002
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,110
So it begins.

1003
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:35,946
[host] The first influencer,

1004
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,316
started in 60th place

1005
00:43:39,383 --> 00:43:43,821
but eventually, worked his way up
to the final 15, Dohwadore.

1006
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:47,958
The starting bid
is one-third of his worth,

1007
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:50,794
2.57 million won.

1008
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:53,197
If you wish to place a bid,

1009
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:57,101
please raise your hand
and state your desired amount.

1010
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:59,603
[suspenseful music]

1011
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:03,540
We will now begin
the bidding for Dohwadore.

1012
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,752
[Dohwadore]
I wanted anyone to call my name.

1013
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:18,222
Having to sell myself like,
"Please, someone buy me."

1014
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:20,924
That's something I'm not good at.

1015
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,259
What do you ladies think?

1016
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,962
It would look nice with a man
and a woman in the photo.

1017
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:26,697
It's tempting, but…

1018
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:29,266
[Dohwadore] My fortune-telling content
is pretty unique

1019
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,768
and somewhat difficult to understand.

1020
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:33,003
People seem to find me hard to approach.

1021
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:36,573
I told myself that getting a chance
to participate in the third round

1022
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,376
is the most important thing,
and I tried to pull myself together.

1023
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:44,481
[Dohwadore] I already figured out
that Round Three would be a team round.

1024
00:44:44,548 --> 00:44:47,051
- Don't look at me.
- What I'm trying to say is that

1025
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:49,253
I might have the lowest worth,

1026
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:51,755
but I've made it here
relying solely on my skills.

1027
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:54,158
So, if you team up with me…

1028
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:00,431
You know,
I even bleached my hair for today.

1029
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:02,666
That's how desperate I am.

1030
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:04,368
Uh…

1031
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:08,539
Just buy us some burgers.

1032
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:09,907
Surely…

1033
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:13,277
I'll make sure we make it to Round Four.

1034
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,779
[host] 2.57 million won.

1035
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,483
- Are there any interested bidders?
- [Juice Seyeon] Oh, no.

1036
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:21,618
- Wait a minute. [groans]
- [DaeDo] Oh, no.

1037
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:23,020
I feel so bad.

1038
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:25,522
[host]
The auction will end in ten seconds.

1039
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:27,658
I'm getting scared
that I'll end up just like him.

1040
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:32,029
But someone has to buy Dohwadore anyway
because MyBoo's worth is too high.

1041
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:33,464
MyBoo, do you want to buy him?

1042
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:35,799
- [Ji-sou] No one can afford MyBoo.
- [Yong-jin] MyBoo, what do you think?

1043
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:36,767
[chuckles]

1044
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:39,002
[tense music]

1045
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:43,006
I'm sorry.

1046
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:47,578
[RISABAE] He kept looking at me
like he was asking me to buy him.

1047
00:45:47,644 --> 00:45:49,780
Oh, it's so heartbreaking.

1048
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:52,382
So I said, "I'm so sorry."

1049
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:54,718
I think she is a warm-hearted person.

1050
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:56,920
[Dohwadore] We were both born
in the Year of the Monkey.

1051
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:57,955
[host] Dohwadore

1052
00:45:58,021 --> 00:46:01,458
has not been sold
as no one wanted to buy him.

1053
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:03,927
- Oh, my god.
- [Juice Seyeon] Oh, no. I'm the next.

1054
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:07,064
So, this is how it feels. Wow.

1055
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:11,068
- [Changhyun] Ah, that's brutal.
- [BBOGUMI] No, I'm scared. [groans]

1056
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:13,103
The red light is on.

1057
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:16,874
[DaeDo] I had the thought,
"Even if I get eliminated today,

1058
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,575
I don't want it to happen like that."

1059
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:21,478
[Junwoo] I mean,
if that had happened to me,

1060
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:23,480
I would've probably cried.

1061
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:26,850
[Dohwadore] Yeah, society can be ruthless.

1062
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:28,152
It is what it is.

1063
00:46:28,218 --> 00:46:30,654
From then on,
I started reworking my strategy.

1064
00:46:31,655 --> 00:46:32,890
Up next?

1065
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:34,491
Juice Seyeon is up next.

1066
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:38,428
- [Changhyun] She is a hot item.
- No, I'm not…

1067
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:39,596
[DaeDo] Great ticket, huh?

1068
00:46:39,663 --> 00:46:41,131
[Changhyun] I'm going to get Juice Seyeon.

1069
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:43,467
[host] The next influencer

1070
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:47,004
aims to expand the global market
beyond AfreecaTV,

1071
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:48,071
"The flirting master…"

1072
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:50,140
- [DaeDo] "The flirting master."
- …Juice Seyeon.

1073
00:46:50,707 --> 00:46:51,942
[laughs]

1074
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:54,778
14TH, JUICE SEYEON
AFREECATV STREAMER

1075
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:56,513
[Changhyun] I think she'll be popular.

1076
00:46:57,181 --> 00:46:59,283
[Junwoo]
I was pretty sure that Juice Seyeon

1077
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:01,685
will have an advantage for the mission.

1078
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:03,587
[Yong-jin] She's got beauty,
which I don't possess.

1079
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,790
[PaniBottle] She's pretty, so of course,
she's going to be popular.

1080
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:09,293
[Juice Seyeon]
I thought there'd be at least one person

1081
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:10,561
who'd want to team up with me.

1082
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:12,296
Because I kind of give off the vibe

1083
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:14,531
that I know what I'm doing
when it comes to photos.

1084
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:15,866
Five mil.

1085
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:17,234
[influencers exclaim]

1086
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:18,302
Six mil.

1087
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:20,704
Wow, they're going high.

1088
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:22,005
Wow, crazy.

1089
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:24,508
6.5.

1090
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:26,643
- Hey, stay out of it.
- Why?

1091
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:28,946
Could ladies please stay out of this?

1092
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,948
Because there aren't
many options for the guys.

1093
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,850
No, I want to team up with her.

1094
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:34,585
[Juice Seyeon] My popularity is no joke.

1095
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:35,953
Oh?

1096
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:39,423
[Juice Seyeon] Maybe now is my chance
to make some money for myself.

1097
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:41,592
- Is there anyone else to raise the bid?
- [Changhyun] What?

1098
00:47:41,658 --> 00:47:43,527
Not me. [chuckles]

1099
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:45,596
[PaniBottle] Ten.

1100
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,030
Ten.

1101
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:49,032
[MyBoo] What? How much? Ten?

1102
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:50,901
Wow, that's insane!

1103
00:47:50,968 --> 00:47:53,737
[PaniBottle] In a game
where we're judged just by one image,

1104
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:55,806
she's got the upper hand.

1105
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:59,076
There's a high chance I won't win,
so if someone does,

1106
00:47:59,142 --> 00:48:01,612
I didn't want them
to spend less than ten million.

1107
00:48:01,678 --> 00:48:02,546
You got that?

1108
00:48:02,613 --> 00:48:04,081
[sad chuckle]

1109
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:05,549
I don't have enough money.

1110
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:08,685
You'll only have
4.5 million left after this.

1111
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:12,189
[PaniBottle] My plan was to make someone
spend their money,

1112
00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:14,091
it didn't matter who it was.

1113
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:17,361
Juice Seyeon is probably
the best one for me, really.

1114
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:19,329
What do I do?

1115
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:23,066
[PaniBottle] Bid. How about 10.1 million?

1116
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:24,234
- [Ji-sou] No one?
- [DaeDo] Yeah.

1117
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:25,802
- 11.
- [suspenseful music]

1118
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:28,438
[host] Jin Yong-jin, 11 million won.

1119
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:33,510
[Yong-jin] Seyeon nim can cover
all the areas I'm not very good at.

1120
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:37,514
Like I can take a photo,
but I'm not great at being in one.

1121
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:40,017
I definitely think I can fill in
through other areas

1122
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:42,552
like planning and creativity.

1123
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:43,954
11.50.

1124
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:46,056
[Ji-sou] Wow, really?

1125
00:48:46,123 --> 00:48:47,591
What the hell?

1126
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:50,227
- Oppa, you spent all your money?
- I went all in.

1127
00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:52,629
You'll only have 30,000 left,
you'll take the risk?

1128
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:56,300
[Junwoo] I was like, "Let's just go for it
and figure out how to make it work later."

1129
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:59,336
I know, he's completely crazy.

1130
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:03,140
[host] Junwoo, 11.5 million won.

1131
00:49:03,206 --> 00:49:05,409
Are there any more interested bidders?

1132
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:07,811
Yong-jin hyung, no more?

1133
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:09,246
Raise the bid.

1134
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:10,714
[Ji-sou] Just point one million.

1135
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:12,849
Oppa, you might get eliminated.

1136
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:14,418
[host] Three,

1137
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:16,586
- two, one.
- [Keun-suk] This isn't the final round.

1138
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,589
He bid all the 30,000 won.

1139
00:49:19,656 --> 00:49:22,292
[host] Juice Seyeon
has been sold to the highest bidder,

1140
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:25,295
Junwoo, for 11.5 million won.

1141
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:27,397
[Ji-sou] Congratulations.

1142
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:31,101
[host] The winning bid of 11.5 million won

1143
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:33,203
will be transferred to Juice Seyeon.

1144
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:35,238
[all exclaim]

1145
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:38,475
[exclaims] Insane. really?

1146
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:40,544
- Wow, I'm rich now!
- I think…

1147
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:43,580
this is going to be the last chance
to spend the money anyway.

1148
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:46,483
It's like you just sent her star balloons
worth ten million won.

1149
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:48,885
Junwoo oppa, your money is here now.

1150
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:53,423
Oppa, your worth was delicious.
[soft chuckle]

1151
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:56,360
- [Juice Seyeon] Wow, thank you.
- [Ji-sou] You did it.

1152
00:49:57,194 --> 00:49:59,262
[Juice Seyeon] You're going all-in
with everything you've got.

1153
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:00,664
I still have 30,000.

1154
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:03,266
- What a man.
- Now I'm jealous.

1155
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:05,202
[tense music]

1156
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:09,206
[Juice Seyeon]
Wow, so that's how it looks.

1157
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:10,407
Look at that.

1158
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:13,176
I should buy someone
since I won't be sold.

1159
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:15,078
Left over money means nothing.

1160
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:16,580
We just have to survive.

1161
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:20,484
[host] The next influencer
is the fighter who lost

1162
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:24,955
one of her eyebrows
in exchange for her survival, BBOGUMI.

1163
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,157
- A fighter!
- [RISABAE] Yes, a fighter!

1164
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:30,894
[host]
Her current worth is 9.08 million won.

1165
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:33,030
- Let's go, BBOGUMI!
- [BBOGUMI] I got this.

1166
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,065
[BBOGUMI] In the last mission,

1167
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:37,801
I did all kinds of weird stuff
just to survive.

1168
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:41,438
So, from now on, I want to look pretty
to make up for that.

1169
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:44,174
[PaniBottle]
Create an image somewhat like BBOGUMI,

1170
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:45,942
a bit comedic and playful.

1171
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:48,245
[Changhyun]
She went as far as shaving her eyebrow.

1172
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:50,781
She's someone I can definitely work with.

1173
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:53,650
I think she's the type of person
who sacrifices herself

1174
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,152
and gives her best at everything.

1175
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:57,521
Please buy me!

1176
00:50:58,455 --> 00:51:00,123
Please buy me!

1177
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:02,426
[BBOGUMI] Buy me, please!

1178
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:04,394
I'm a woman too!

1179
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:06,396
BBOGUMI
3,020,000

1180
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:09,299
[BBOGUMI] I felt really good
being the center of attention

1181
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:11,134
of all those people sitting in a circle.

1182
00:51:11,201 --> 00:51:14,037
It felt like
I was a celebrity or something.

1183
00:51:15,138 --> 00:51:17,007
3.52 million won.

1184
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,176
- [BBOGUMI] How much?
- [PaniBottle] 3.52 million.

1185
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:20,844
Bid, bid higher!

1186
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:23,613
Bid higher!

1187
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,682
Kick, drum, bass.

1188
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,617
Kick, drum, bass.

1189
00:51:28,285 --> 00:51:29,486
Kick, kick.

1190
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:31,054
Panni hyungnim, congrats.

1191
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:32,456
You've got a great deal.

1192
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:34,424
[laughs]

1193
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:36,093
A great deal?

1194
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,295
No one wants to buy.

1195
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:41,765
[PaniBottle] I think BBOGUMI is useful
and worth the investment.

1196
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:43,700
- Kick, kick.
- [PaniBottle] Am I making a mistake?

1197
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:46,470
Yo, hurry and buy me!

1198
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:48,371
I'm gonna treat you so well.

1199
00:51:48,905 --> 00:51:51,508
Eun-ji nim, can you please buy me?

1200
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:54,277
- Eun-ji nim.
- Why me?

1201
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:56,346
'Cause I need a pretty woman.

1202
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:58,715
- [OKING] She needs a pretty woman.
- [DaeDo] A pretty woman.

1203
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,984
[host] 3.52 million won.

1204
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:03,153
Are there any more interested bidders?

1205
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,087
Should I go for it?

1206
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:07,958
[host]
The auction will end in three seconds.

1207
00:52:08,024 --> 00:52:10,393
Three, two, one.

1208

00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:18,869
[BBOGUMI] Oh yeah!

4.52 million.

1212
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:23,140
Oh, let's go!

1213
00:52:23,206 --> 00:52:25,909
Hyung, go travel instead. Stop it.

1214
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,244
[Changhyun] "Go travel instead."

1215
00:52:27,878 --> 00:52:29,379
4.62 million.

1216
00:52:29,946 --> 00:52:30,847
Ah, that's no good.

1217
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:32,682
[PaniBottle]
My strategy from the beginning

1218
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:34,818
was to get BBOGUMI no matter what.

1219
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:36,286
I was ready to go all in.

1220
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:37,521
5.02.

1221
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:39,322
[influencers exclaim]

1222
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:41,224
- [Changhyun] I lost.
- He means it.

1223
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:43,660
- He's so determined.
- I can't do anymore.

1224
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:46,530
What do you mean by that? [chuckles]

1225
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:48,798
Young people know how to spend money.

1226
00:52:48,865 --> 00:52:51,735
[host] BBOGUMI has been sold to PaniBottle

1227
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:54,771
for 5.02 million won.

1228
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,740
Yay! Thank you.

1229
00:52:56,806 --> 00:53:00,277
Keun-suk, don't worry.
You're the hottest item.

1230
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:01,811
- I'm nervous.
- [chuckles]

1231
00:53:01,878 --> 00:53:03,914
I wasn't sure if people would pick me.

1232
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:07,717
I always barely made it
through each round,

1233
00:53:07,784 --> 00:53:11,288
and I felt a bit nervous that the others
might have lost faith in me.

1234
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:12,622
I was anxious.

1235
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:15,792
They might decide
not to choose me after all.

1236
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:17,928
[host] The next influencer,

1237
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:21,364
whose survival has been
more dramatic than a K-drama,

1238
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:23,233
- Jang Keun-suk.
- [Changhyun] Let's go.

1239
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,168
They mentioned "drama" in my intro.

1240
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:26,236
[Changhyun] Keun-suk Jang,
you're up next.

1241
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:28,171
"More dramatic than a K-drama".

1242
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:31,741
- [Changhyun] He's a great item!
- [DaeDo] This is big.

1243
00:53:31,808 --> 00:53:33,510
[Changhyun] This one is wow.

1244
00:53:34,077 --> 00:53:35,845
[DaeDo]
Jang Keun-suk was my number one choice.

1245
00:53:35,912 --> 00:53:38,281
[MyBoo]
He's a celebrity and has many followers.

1246
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:41,284
[Yong-jin] And you know,
we can't overlook the wisdom he's gained

1247
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:43,353
from experience and age.

1248
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,155
[laughs]

1249
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,223
JANG KEUN-SUK

1250
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:50,360

1252
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:54,764
[DaeDo] 4 million won.

1253
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:56,333
It's getting hot in here.

1254
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:57,400
4.1.

1255
00:53:58,034 --> 00:53:59,336
4.5 million.

1256
00:54:00,036 --> 00:54:02,572
[chuckles] This feels so weird.

1257
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:06,176
[Keun-suk] It reminded me of the old days
when I was in high school

1258
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:08,445
or my early 20s when I was a rookie actor.

1259
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:13,016
Back then, I was ready to do anything
and would look confident doing it.

1260
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:17,587
Standing there, in the middle of everyone,
felt like I was auditioning again.

1261
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:20,323
CURRENT BID
4.5 MILLION WON

1262
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:21,992
How high are you going to go?

1263
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:25,195
[chuckles] I'm definitely getting
the item I want, no matter what.

1264
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,329
Oh, really?

1265
00:54:26,396 --> 00:54:27,497
[influencers exclaim]

1266
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:28,832

JIN YONG-JIN
6-MILLION-WON BID

1268
00:54:30,867 --> 00:54:34,037
If two men are going to team up,
Keun-suk would be the best option.

1269
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,705
- [BBOGUMI] I agree.
- [Juice Seyeon] You're totally right.

1270
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:38,308
[dramatic music]

1271
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:40,377
- Why are you not taking him, hyung?
- [DaeDo] What?

1272
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:41,845
[Ji-sou]
You said you get the item you want.

1273
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:43,380
- No matter what.
- Well, that's…

1274
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,850
[Keun-suk] We're in a profession
where we have to be chosen

1275
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:47,951
by others anyway.

1276
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:49,052
I'm worth six million?

1277
00:54:49,686 --> 00:54:50,687
[Keun-suk] I felt desperate.

1278
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:54,858
So that's when I decided to do something
to raise my purchase value.

1279
00:54:56,893 --> 00:54:58,895
Folks, this is your chance to have me!

1280
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:03,433
If I buy you, will you appear
in my YouTube video?

1281
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,669
- I'll do anything that you want.
- [Ji-sou exclaims]

1282
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:07,570
Will you act in our video?

1283
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:09,439
I come with after-sales service.

1284
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:10,974
- Eight million.
- [Ji-sou] That's tempting.

1285
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:12,409
- Eight mil.
- [Changhyun] Eight million?

1286
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:13,343
PYO EUN-JI
8-MILLION-WON-BID

[Eun-ji]
I'm actually an enormous fan of his.

1289
00:55:17,681 --> 00:55:19,282
If I get to team up with him,

1290
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:20,750
I'll be happy with just that.

1291
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:22,552
I won't care if I get eliminated.

1292
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:24,020
Ten!

1293
00:55:24,087 --> 00:55:25,522
Ten?

1294
00:55:25,588 --> 00:55:27,624
- Oh, shit.
- [whoops]

1295
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:30,593
It's only ten million won. Ten million.

1296
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,162
More, more, more!

1297
00:55:32,228 --> 00:55:33,496
[Eun-ji] 11!

1298
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:35,999
- 12!
- [Eun-ji] 12?

1299
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:38,168
12.5!

1300
00:55:38,234 --> 00:55:39,602
[chuckles]

1301
00:55:40,603 --> 00:55:42,572
[Keun-suk]
I'm definitely worth that money.

1302
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:44,407
Not so bad.

1303
00:55:44,474 --> 00:55:47,944
- [Changhyun] Oh.
- [host] Pyo Eun-ji, 12.5 million won.

1304
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:51,047
I can't believe I have to let him go
because I'm short on money.

1305
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:56,019
CURRENT BID
12.5 MILLION WON

1306
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:57,053
I don't have enough.

[host]
The auction will end in three seconds.

1308
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:03,193

1309
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:10,467
Jang Keun-suk has been sold to Pyo Eun-ji
for 12.5 million won.

1310
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:13,737
[Yong-jin] Not being able to team up
with Jang Keun-suk was such a letdown.

1311
00:56:14,604 --> 00:56:16,239
This is so annoying.

1312
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:21,010
[host] The winning bid of 12.5 million won
will be transferred to Jang Keun-suk.

1313
00:56:21,077 --> 00:56:23,413
Not bad. [laughs]

1315
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:29,819
[Keun-suk] That's me! That's who I am!

He's got 23 million now.

1320
00:56:41,431 --> 00:56:42,532
Thank you.

1321
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:45,468
I bought the Asia Prince for 12,500,000.

1322
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:46,970
Thank you.

1323
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:49,272
You know, it actually doesn't feel so bad.

1324
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:53,476
[Keun-suk] All right, from now on,
I'm not afraid of anyone anymore.

1325

Huh? What was that?

1328
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:01,117
What? [chuckles]

1329
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:02,152
- Huh?
- [DaeDo] Hey now.

1330
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:03,553
Oh, the VIP benefit?
