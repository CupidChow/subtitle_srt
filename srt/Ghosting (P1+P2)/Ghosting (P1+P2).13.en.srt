I want to cry it all out, too.

544
00:26:57,867 --> 00:26:58,900
I want to let go.

545
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,900
You know what?

546
00:27:07,033 --> 00:27:09,467
Just because you're not crying,

547
00:27:09,567 --> 00:27:10,833
doesn't mean
you're not grieving.

548
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:13,033
Okay?

549
00:27:16,767 --> 00:27:18,900
We need to be strong for others.

for each other.</i>
