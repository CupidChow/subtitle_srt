552
00:28:51,433 --> 00:28:53,833
I don't want anything
to do with ghosts!

553
00:28:53,967 --> 00:28:55,200
My sibling is not a ghost.

00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,667
I'm begging you.

00:29:02,233 --> 00:29:03,700
Delusional?
What do you mean?

He said he needs my help.

559
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,567
It has something
to do with his sibling.

00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,633
Is he cute?

561
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,600
You know, I'm getting
worried about you.

562
00:29:11,733 --> 00:29:15,433
Grandma,
I still love that bastard.

563
00:29:15,567 --> 00:29:17,700
Your feelings are
getting the better of you.

00:29:18,767 --> 00:29:21,400
Oh, wait!
Shut your curtains first.

00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,100
You're overreacting!
