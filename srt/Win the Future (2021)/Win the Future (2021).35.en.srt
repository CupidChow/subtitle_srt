00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,330
Leaders, this is an analysis

31
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,850
- and also a strategic plan.
- Hello, Director Zhou.

32
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,280
Its contents determine

33
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,490
whether or not we can completely open up the upstream and downstream relationship

34
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:00,470
from high-end solutions to specific implementations of technology.

It also determines the direction of Jieke's strategies for the next ten years.

36
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,520
It determines every employee's salaries

37
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,560
and every shareholder's year-end bonuses.

38
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,640
- It determines everyone's...
- Are you busy?

No. I'm not.

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,820
- Help me get a cup of coffee.
- Okay, I'll go right now.

- I want an Americano.
- Okay.

The Son of Heaven creates thunder, and the sound reaches the sky.

43
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,090
High-end solutions are great,

44
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,430
but in an operating system,

45
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,290
there are runners wherever there are talkers.

46
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,590
In our cooperation with Huikang,

47
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,570
the talkers are responsible for the strategies.

48
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,770
As runners, we just need to focus

49
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,190
on the specific implementation of the technology.

50
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,920
This will form a system.

51
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,220
I've done some calculations.

If the system works well
[Jieke and Huikang's Strategic Cooperation Effectiveness Trend]

53
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,150
and we successfully complete the first phase of the cooperation,

54
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,740
our market share can increase to forty two percent.

55
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,890
I get it.

56
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,090
Huikang controls forty two percent of the entire market with their mouths

57
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,570
and Jieke uses their legs

58
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,520
to run to nearly half the machine rooms in the country.

59
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,770
Legs won't snap from running.

60
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,970
As long as we're in charge of the implementation,

61
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,790
and we're the ones who work with the clients,

62
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:23,120
this logically makes sense.

63
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,090
But the prerequisite for that is the chip-resource sharing.

64
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,520
Once Huikang becomes in charge of the strategies,

65
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,890
it means that they can share their existing chip inventory with us.

66
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,390
It'll solve our current issues with a dozens of our orders

67
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:38,130
for the shipments of more than five thousand servers.

68
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,770
Once the strategies and implementation are split,

69
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:45,580
it means that the company will make a profit of less than forty percent from all of our business.

70
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,740
Huikang will always take the largest share.

71
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,980
Forget about all of that,

72
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:56,470
but this still means that we'll lose the front-end of the sales team.

73
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,560
I agree with President Chen.

74
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,920
It's because the clients will definitely be discussing the plans before they do anything else.

75
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,230
No one starts by directly discussing implementation.

76
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:11,240
This means that we're giving up the dominant power of the market to them.

77
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,100
Wei Yan,

78
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:17,150
I really think that you can bring Jieke's sales department

79
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,010
directly to Huikang's office to work for them.

80
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,800
President Chen,

81
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:35,450
my proudest moments were at Jieke,

82
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,570
and most dejected moments were also at Jieke.

83
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:42,960
Someone stole my client that year, and I was even splashed with dirty water.

84
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,150
The client filed a complaint against me.

85
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,680
An elder in my family passed away and I was in a lot of debt.

86
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,840
I fell apart

87
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,500
and was diagnosed with depression.

88
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,110
A sentence you said to me allowed me to hold out until now.

89
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,100
You said, "Wei Yan,

90
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,930
someone pouring shit on you is a good thing.

91

That's fertilizer.

It'll allow you to sprout and blossom."

94
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:17,870
President Chen,

95
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,200
I've sprouted now, haven't I?

96
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,820
I blossomed, too, didn't I?

97
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,210
So to me now,

98
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,390
I'm no longer afraid of other people throwing dirty water on me,

99
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,970
even if it's you who do that.

100
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,410
Hello?

101
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,880
We're here to talk about a plan for breaking the game today.

102
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,760
What's hidden behind the plan

103
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,910
is to hand over Jieke's core business, sales,

104
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,150
the whole package, over to Huikang.

105
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,780
However, from a profit point of view,

106
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:30,140
we're the ones controlling forty two percent of the market, not Huikang.

107
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,460
Since I can implement this plan,

108
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,310
I know how to defend Jieke's bottom line.

109
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,600
- I don't believe that.  - That's your fault.

Is there anything I can do for you?

112

I looked at Wei Yan's plan.

113
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,790
And then?

114
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,950
The board is currently discussing this plan.

115
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,540
That's your Jieke's business.

116
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,490
Does it have anything to do with Huikang's sales director?

117
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,060
I'm hanging up if there's nothing else.

118
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,510
This isn't Wei Yan's plan.

119
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:15,930
- It's your plan.
- This is Huikang's established strategy.

120
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,600
We've been working on it for half a year already.

121
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,760
The only difference is whom we work with.

122
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,430
Has Engineer Liu seen this proposal?

123
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,910
Engineer Liu isn't at Huikang anymore.

124
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:27,320
You know that isn't what I'm asking.

125
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,670
Actually, even if Engineer Liu were still at Huikang,

126
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,800
he's still only responsible for technical support.

127
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,450
He never sees what we do with strategy.

128
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,740
Then who's the technological consultant for this proposal?

129
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,350
Zhou Rui,

130

does this have anything to do with you?

131
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,950
If I were Lin Zhen Wei,

132
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:53,080
I would fire this technology consultant immediately.

133
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,370
I come from a sales background.

134
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,940
You as well.

135
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,630
Everyone present should understand

136
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:02,370
that by completely separating the sales business from the company's management system,

137
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:05,030
as a CEO, I'd be an empty shell.

138
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,090
And you?

139
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,720
As for you, using backdoor listings to deceive others.

140
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,530
What a great move!

141
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:17,300
You taught me that personal interests should always yield to the overall situation.

142
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,430
That's why I want to state another opinion.

143
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,120
This plan is amazing.

144
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,130
The board of directors should approve of this plan.

145
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:30,290
Not only that, they'll also pull all of the company's resources to fully support and operate under this plan.

146
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:33,730
However, the person running this plan isn't fit for the job.

147
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,390
That is, Director Wei isn't a fit.

148
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,890
- Master.
- We're in a board meeting.

149
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,970
Call me President Chen.

150
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,900
Since it's a strategy, marshal to marshal.

151
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,160
I'll personally talk to Lin Zhen Wei about this.

152
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,390
That's proper etiquette, isn't it?

153
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,240
President Chen, I spent three days coming up with this plan.

154
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,530
- I won't give up on it.
- Enough, enough.

155
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,830
Since the proposal has been approved,

156
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:05,080
can the two of you talk about the specifics of implementing it in private after the meeting?

157
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,860
President Li,

158
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,340
the company affairs aren't private affairs.

159
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,790
So what you're trying to say is that the proposal won't work from a technological perspective?

160
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,980
In terms of technology,

161
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,430
this proposal is doomsday.

162
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,670
Whom are you trying to scare, Zhou Rui?

163
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,530
This is called alarmism, you know?

164
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,900
Director Luo, listen to me!

165
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,290
If we carry out with this plan,

166
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:31,550
in two years, Jieke won't have anymore technology personnel at the strategic level,

167
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:35,860
and all of Huikang engineers will slowly become administration.

168
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,300
I'm serious.

169
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,480
Perhaps this can also be said the other way.

170
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,820
In two years, Huikang's engineers will be researching strategies every day,

171
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,700
and Jieke's technological personnel will be in machine rooms every day.

172
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,660
So this plan will cause destruction to both sides!

173
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,420
Why can't it be a win-win situation?

174
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,290
Why can't you look on the bright side?

175
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,990
Yes.

176
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,940
We win now,

177
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,800
but we lose the future.

178
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,650
Zhou Rui, can you wake up?

179
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:06,580
You can't even hold on to the people in front of you,

180

what right do you have to talk about the future?

Chairman Li, President Chen,

182
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:15,030
I also think that Director Wei isn't really suited

183
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,170
to take charge of this project.

184
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:21,090
What an eye opener!

185
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,260
Are we even having a board meeting?

186
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,730
It seems like a hodgepodge to me!

187
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:30,020
Everyone, take a look! This is Director Wei's USB.

188

How can you prove that it's mine?

You've used Cui Long's computer before, haven't you?

Let me borrow your laptop for a while.

When I was talking with Director Zhou and Guo Han,

200
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:18,390
how was Luo Jia so accurately able to choke off

202

But the clients belong to the company.

206

Guo Han's order is also the company's business.

The Beijing unit's resources also belong to the company.

208
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,010
You took these

209
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,360
as your calling card to make a deal with Huikang.

210
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,910
I don't think it's appropriate.

211

But today, I don't want to take them anymore.

What he wants is...

If Huikang can take the central lead in the upstream and downstream markets,

No one will know what Jieke's center position is.

Wait! The problem is that he can't get it in the future.

In sales, it isn't strange that we know people.

322
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,900
But you must not have ever met me.

323
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,780
I'm dressed like this, but you still recognize me.

324
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:05,930
- What does that mean?
- It means you knew I'd be here today.

325
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,180
Of course, I know you came here for the chip.

326
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:11,060
I just didn't expect Huikang to move so fast.

327
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,690
Whoever gets in first will get it first.

328
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:15,900
- That's how sales is.
- Not necessarily.

329
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,120
To me, it doesn't matter who arrives first, the highest price wins.

330
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,700
How about this?

331
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,000
If you are out of the game first, I'll set the price.

332
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,910
If I am out first, then you name the price.

333
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,690
- Is that fair?
- Get in place!

334
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,630
Go, go, go! Hurry up!

335
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,740
Who? Who is that?

336
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,390
Don't pull on me! Let go of me!

337
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,010
Who is it?

338
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,010
- Who was that?
- Didn't see!

339
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,790
Let's go!

340
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:29,130
Director Luo! Director Luo!

341
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:37,120
Fang Wei! Stop right there!

342
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,990
It really is you, Fang Wei?

343
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,940
Director Luo, it's me!

344
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,460
You exposed me six times.

345
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,000
Just you wait!

346
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,020
It's just a game, Director Luo.

347
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:00,810
Fang Wei from the administration department.

348
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,440
I'm in the sales department now.

349
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,520
Nice to meet you, President Tian.

350
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:11,060
I just heard the deal between you two.

351
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,610
Mind adding one more?

352
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:15,860
Of course, I mind.

353
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:19,040
President Tian, no matter what price Huikang gives you,

354
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,230
our Jieke will give you aten percent more from what they give you.

355
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:26,290
Fang Wei, who are you scaring?

356
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:28,720
What rules don't I know about at Jieke?

357
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,750
You're in sales, so you have no authority to set the price, even if you were in a high position.

358
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,320
President Tian, you've also known Jieke for a long time.

359
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,980
What I said is correct, didn't I?

360
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,350
I'm getting old, so I can't play anymore.

361
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,190
I'm tired and won't discuss more today.

362
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,720
I won't discuss anything.

363
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,350
President Tian, are you sure you don't want to talk about the price?

364
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,340
- It isn't the price.
- Then what is it?

365
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,850
I said I'm tired, so I'm not going to discuss anything; not a thing.

366
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:55,350
President Tian, for the sake of being co-workers, let me ask you one last question.

367
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:58,430
Won't you talk with us, and not with Huikang, either?

368
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:59,920
President Tian!

369
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:21,960
- President Tian, can I come in?
- Please come in.

370
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,740
Haven't you left?

371
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,150
I'd like to know

372
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:31,540
what price level will satisfy you?

373
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:37,530
Let's put it this way!

374
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,390
I have conflicts with Jieke.

375
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:43,730
I don't want to touch any deals that involve Jieke.

376
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:46,420
Can you make it more clear?

377
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,010
You have a relationship with Zhou Rui, haven't you?

378
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:53,550
That means you're related to Jieke.

379
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:58,130
I have nothing with Zhou Rui anymore.

380
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,370
A salesperson's mouth is like a cheating ghost.

381
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,260
Why should I believe you?

382
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:06,400
If you don't believe me, you can ask Fang Wei.

383
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,460
But there is something I'm curious about.

384
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:13,970
Will Zhou Rui help you or help Jieke?

385
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:19,200
President Tian.

386
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,940
You're going in circles.

387
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,160
You're really confusing me.

388
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,130
Okay.

389
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:31,470
Then I won't go in a circle anymore.

390
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,190
I have a partner who is also my money master.

391
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:36,830
He has the power to set the price.

392
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,770
Can I know who that person is?

393
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,570
Can I meet that person in person?

394
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:44,160
You know him! It's Liu Yu Fan.

395
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,070
Come in.

396
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:00,740
President Chen.

397
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,550
I finished talking with President Tian.

398
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:07,280
And then?

399
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,180
I can't promise that he'll work with us,

400
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,930
but I can promise Director Zhou can't do it, either.

401
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:16,190
- Only I can.
- Why?

402
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:19,040
Why can't Zhou Rui do it?

403
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,510
It's because he can't do anything to Luo Jia.

404
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:36,690
Give me another one of the same.

405
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,150
Thanks.

406
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:51,030
Tell me! What do you want to do?

407
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:55,590
I can get all of Tian Cheng Zhou's chips.

408
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:58,810
Moreover, I hope the company can give me more opportunities.

409
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:02,330
Director Wei has left and Cui Long can't catch up right away.

410
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:05,670
Director Zhou's cloud computing won't be profitable in the short term.

411
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:09,130
However, someone has to develop the traditional business.

412
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:11,950
You should use me.

413
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,800
Come in!

414
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,100
Eat!

415
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,010
Have some!

416
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,610
Get it yourself!

417
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,460
Here!

418
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,570
Eat!

419
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,800
Okay.

420
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:41,840
In that case, should we start calling him Director Fang?

421
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,880
Even if we dare call him that, would he dare accept it?

422
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,750
What are you looking it?

423
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:51,090
Let me say this! According to the company's arrangement,

424
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:53,530
Wei Yan's group office space, starting from today,

425
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:57,600
will move to that big conference room.

426
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:00,860
Cui Long, why are you still dawdling?

427
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,910
Hurry and move!

428
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:16,090
Hello! I'm the director of sales at Jieke, Fang Wei.

429
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:24,720
Hello! I'm Jieke's director of sales, Fang Wei.

430
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,740
[RMB: 19,800.00 (about $3000)]

431
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,030
President Liu, your guest is here.

432
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:47,500
- Jieke's Fang Wei, isn't it?
- Yes.

433
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,130
Let him come in then.

434
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,400
You do have high standards for the suit.

435
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,330
The shoes don't match. Let me choose a pair for you!

436
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,120
You aren't appreciative.

437
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,660
As long as you give me Tian Cheng Zhou's chips,

438
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:38,350
I can let go of chasing Zhao Ying.

439
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:41,050
What was the last sentence?

440
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:45,230
I can let go of Zhao Ying.

441
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,650
Let me also repeat this!

442
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:52,280
Zhao Ying's my girlfriend to start with, do I need you to let go?

443
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,650
Then let me also repeat it!

444
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,730
Who's girlfriend she is at the end,

445
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:04,750
depends only on her.

446
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,380
Bring me the blank contract form on the desk.

447
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,300
There's a lot of them, which one do you want?

448
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,350
The one on the chips.

449
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:23,190
Director Fang, are you really leaving?

450
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:25,850
I can give you the chips today.

451
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:27,950
But I'll talk rudely up front.

452
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:32,110
For every single one, I will increase the price to twenty percent.

453
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,830
How many do you want?

454
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,530
But don't you forget!

455
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:46,270
This twenty percent is still because of Zhao Ying.

456
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,410
What's wrong?

457
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,570
You look bad.

458
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:16,310
You're hungry, aren't you?

459
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:30,820
Director Luo, there's a package for you.

460
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:34,840
I'm in the small meeting room. Come over!

461
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:37,200
Uncle Lin, come here quickly. Hurry up.

462
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,600
- Yu Fan.
- Come, come!

463
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,290
Come in here, Uncle Lin.

464
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:42,080
I don't want anyone to see.

465
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,960
What's caused you to be in such a rush like this?

466
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,860
It's s-still about that gap with the money.

467
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:58,640
In business, you must separate professional from personal matters.

468
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,440
If you need money, come to me.

469
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,520
You can't touch the account.

470
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:07,120
Your dad didn't tell you about this rule?

471
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,990
He never agreed for me to do business.

472
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:12,280
You's better not telling my dad about this.

473
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:16,750
If he finds out, he'll exile me to somewhere like Burkina Faso.
(TN: Burkina Faso is a landlocked country in western Africa.)

474
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,930
Okay, okay.

475
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:24,210
Just let me fill up the gap with the money.

476
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:27,200
Really, Uncle?

477
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,710
Really?

478
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:31,270
I can't thank you enough for the benevolence.

479
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:34,660
Then I'll just directly connect with the accounting department.

480
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,030
Why don't you remember anything at all?

481
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,960
- No, I really—
- I just told you

482
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,990
to separate personal from professional.

483
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:45,880
So many people keep an eye on that couple of official accounts.

484
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,090
You've gotten yourself into the trouble.

485
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:50,120
Now, do you want to drag me down, too?

486
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,500
Let me tell you! If you really want your invested money to come back,

487
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,560
use your brain well.

488
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,860
Analyze the market!

489
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:05,330
Uncle Lin, I knew you were thinking about my chips.

490
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:07,530
Once the contract is signed,

491
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:10,150
I'll arrange for the company to pay you.

492
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:13,960
But you don't have to send me the merchandise.

493
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,810
Understand?

494
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:18,210
Uncle Lin,

495
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:22,000
what drugs are you selling exactly?

496
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:25,920
Immortality drugs!

497
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,350
What don't you eat anything?

498
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:59,040
Have some!

499
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,540
If I say...

500
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,590
If I say I'm nervous, would you believe it?

501
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,290
I believe it.

502
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,550
You're making me nervous.

503
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:26,680
Eat, eat, eat!

504
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,370
I'm not satisfied just eating dinner with you.

505
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,910
What did you say?

506
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,050
Listen to me!

507
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:50,910
When can we eat breakfast together everyday?

508
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,730
Du Heng.

509
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,450
You mean?

510
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:03,450
I...

511
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,150
Waiter!

512
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:10,940
Waiter? That one...

513
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,700
I want some more sparkling water.

514
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,820
President Du.

515
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,510
Du Heng.

516
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:40,070
Boss, do you want to change locations?

517
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:42,650
No need!

518
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,430
Zhou Rui and Fang Wei are here.

519
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:47,680
Do you want to change locations?

520
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,410
No need!

521
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,160
Okay.

522
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:06,930
This is the menu, do you want anything to drink?

523
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:14,730
- Du Heng, I'm going to the bathroom.
- Okay.

524
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:18,740
Take a look over there! We'll order what they order.

525
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,770
Sure! Please wait.

526
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,940
Cloud computing doesn't make money.

527
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,950
At least, not rapidly.

528
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:19,270
But I need money.

529
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,700
Why do you suddenly need money?

530
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,820
Not suddenly, I've always needed it.

531
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:32,020
I still have some savings.

532
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:36,050
If there is anything you need to solve, you can ask me.

533
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:40,500
- It's fine to suffer a little when you are young.
- Hey.

534
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,270
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

535
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:45,510
Other than dirty tricks, what else can you do?

536
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,910
- Where did you learn that from?
- From you!

537
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:50,720
Don't! You learned it from him.

538
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,030
Director Luo, this has nothing to with him.

539
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:58,030
If I say it does, then it does.

540
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:00,480
Luo Jia, what's wrong?

541
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,940
Ask him!

542
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:07,300
- Luo Jia.
- Zhou Rui.

543
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:14,170
Today, I was going to confess that I liked her to her.

544
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,220
It really is such a bad coincidence.

545
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:30,450
Sorry!

546
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:36,940
[Jieke Company]

547
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,660
Why are you back?

548
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,300
Why are you here, too?

549
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,200
It's rare to see you working overtime.

550
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,720
Is there no game today?

551
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,280
I promised Yao Yao.

552
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,490
A month's trial period! It isn't there yet.

553
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:41,390
Bei Yao Yao really can control you.

554
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:45,220
Didn't that little flight attendant turn you head over heels?

555
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,330
I understand now.

556
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:50,310
All of our lives

557
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:53,390
are all predetermined.

558
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:55,230
You're predestined by your mother.

559
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:57,670
I'm predestined by being poor.

560
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,870
We've been all brainwashed

561
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:04,430
by the idea that from hard work,

562
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:06,310
comes success.

563
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:08,460
In reality,

564
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,880
no matter how you fight, it's all the same.

565
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:23,450
[Zhao Ying]

566
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:30,460
Why aren't you picking up the flight attendant's phone call?

567
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:42,990
Heat up something and prepare something for yourself.

568
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:10,110
Take it off!

569
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:14,370
Take your clothes off!

570
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:35,210
I've thought about it, we have to put an end to it.

571
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:37,810
Hurry up! Come on.

572
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:41,080
- What are you doing?
- Don't you want to sleep with me?

573
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,910
Come on!

574
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,520
Are you taking it off or should I?

575
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:53,470
I forgot!

576
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,600
People like you like to do it yourselves.

577
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,630
You like to conquer.

578
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:03,430
Once we sleep together, it's over.

579
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:05,440
Over...

580
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:10,630
Sleeping together or not, it's impossible for it to be over.

581
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,470
You chose what you wanted.

582
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:16,500
I can only choose what I want.

583
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,410
We have to be finished.

584
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,860
I admit it.

585
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:37,280
In the beginning, the reason I chased after you is that I wanted revenge against Liu Yu Fan,

586
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:41,390
but I don't know when I started liking you to the point

587
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:44,140
where I'm that scared.

588
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:54,190
What are you scared of?

589
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:56,300
I can't do anything...
