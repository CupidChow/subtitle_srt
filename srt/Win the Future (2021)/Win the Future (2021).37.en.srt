[Where is grandma?]

166
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,430
Where is grandma?

167
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,230
Are you okay, Sister?

168
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,840
We're back in our hometown.

169
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,470
Scumbag!

170
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,980
Scumbag of the century!

171
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,150
Are you talking about... Wang Yi Nan?

172
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:29,990
Tell all the team members that we're working through this weekend

173
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,750
at my house and to keep quiet about this.

174
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,720
Okay. Got it!

175
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,780
I have to nail Sanke's project.

176
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:47,790
Sister, you could kill someone with that look in your eyes right now.

177
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,400
Go home early.

178

[Luo Jia: Where is Grandma?]
[Scumbag: We're back in our hometown.]

179
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,080
Who came, Ungrateful Child?

180
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,950
Food delivery guy, probably.

181
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,980
Who is it?

182
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,020
You're back.

183
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,650
I'm back.

184
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:57,540
If Grandma wasn't ill, I wouldn't have called you.

185
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,300
I know! I know you called

186
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,290
because Grandma asked you to.

187
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,860
Mother.

188
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:19,020
- Mother, I've come back.
- It's good you're back.

189
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,190
Do you see my pair of blue leather shoes?

190
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,920
What shoes?

191
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,750
That pair of dark blue shoes.

192
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,550
My William Martin limited editions.

193
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,850
Why do you need to find those shoes right now?

194
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,520
It's so late and you aren't going out.

195
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,550
Just help me find them!

196
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,740
My son bought them for me.

197
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,660
I'm Zhou Zhi Di,

198
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,550
your son.

199
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,980
Your hair's grey already.

200
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,280
My son isn't that old.

201
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,710
I'm past sixty years old.

202
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,480
How couldn't my hair turn grey, Mother?

203
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,000
I don't care! Hurry up and find my shoes.

204
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,210
Okay, okay, I'll help you find them.

205
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:22,990
- Seriously!
- I'll look for them.

206
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,400
Hello, Si Qin! Tell us what you have observed today.

207
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:02,010
Alright. I'm currently at the World Internet Conference. Today...

208
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,130
How is my mother doing?

209
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,420
Same old, same old.

210
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,890
The whole conference has twenty panels.

211
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:11,410
We have economic panel, information technology panel,...

212
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,730
How many days are you staying this time?

213
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:16,760
Three to five days, like usual?

214
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,690
I used to stay for three to five days.

215
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:24,160
Every time I came back, it's always your mother who took care of the print shop alone.

216
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,320
The global numbers and man labor...

217
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,720
I also have an idea.

218
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,690
Can we take grandma overseas for treatments?

219
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,090
As long as grandma can get better, anywhere is fine with me.

220
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:37,890
...it's over two hundred twenty thousand yuan.

221
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:40,100
The percentage in GDP is...

222
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,960
How is yours and my mother's print shop doing?

223
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,120
Looking at China, the digital economy has already became...

224
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,960
Same old. We manage.

225
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,510
In the artificial intelligence panel,

226
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,070
we can see that...

227
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,850
I know that you look down on me.

228
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:59,790
Everybody was against it when I took the patent overseas back in the day.

229
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:02,640
Including your mentor, Chen Ming Kai.

230
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,270
During the debate,

231
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:07,520
we heard a key term, which is combining.

232
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,490
We can see that...

233
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:10,640
Do you regret it?

234
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,770
It isn't about me regretting it or not.

235
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:16,530
Tech people are naive.

236
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,460
Too stubborn!

237
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,340
The representatives of those industries are all present.

238
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,480
What's the term that they mention a lot? It is the market ecosystem.

239
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,790
Which means, in the past...

240
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,880
These years when I was abroad,

241
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,900
I has also done Q and A's like this.

242
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,910
To be honest, Chinese cloud engineering started late.

243
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:40,780
Our technology isn't as good as foreign countries.

244
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:44,280
You really don't have any idea what your son is up to?

245
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,730
In the middle of all this, it...

246
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:48,030
Does Chen Ming Kai know?

247
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,020
Cloud computing's needs are actually...

248
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,190
To be fair, he doesn't know, either.

249
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:56,710
We'll see the project land.

250
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,620
How should I put this?

251
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,930
We were both...

252
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:04,660
leftovers from the age of the internet.

253
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:08,560
Nobody cares what you've done in the past.

254
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:13,150
So his persistence

255
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,930
was useless?

256
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:21,440
Oh right! Have you seen your grandma's pair of dark blue leather shoes?

257
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,930
Which dark blue leather shoes?

258
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:26,630
She said they're a limited edition.

259
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:30,860
Didn't you buy them for her?

260
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,190
In the market, at a time like this...

261
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,360
What did you say?

262
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,070
One-page proposal.

263
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,270
You guys have been at it all morning, is it really that hard to complete?

264
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:49,440
The Great Hero dumped fifty six pages on us.

265
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,130
He now, wants to reduce it to a single page; it isn't alchemy.

266
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:56,090
It's such a big project; just for explaining the technology, one page isn't enough.

267
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:58,700
He only said one page, but didn't say how big a page is.

268
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:02,510
Why don't we take a couple of pieces of paper and make it into one large page?

269
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:05,100
- You have the right idea.
- Good idea!

270
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,670
How long does it takes for a three branch project to open for bidding?

271
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:12,460
The most important project for the company right now is this one.

272
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:16,410
I really don't understand how you all can laugh at this point.

273
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:18,440
Director Fang, let me be honest with you.

274
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,010
This project was given to you by President Chen.

275
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:21,940
We don't even know what the client likes, so we can only provide materials.

276
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,410
You should be the one to refine it.

277
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:26,990
I made the rule not to see the client before the preparations were complete.

278
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,360
One page may not get to play,

279
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,730
but if you don't write it, then we definitely don't get to play.

280
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:44,170
You all think over how to write it.

281
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,890
I'll be back to check on your progress later.

282
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,180
How are we supposed to complete it?

283
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:52,890
- Different boss, different rules.
- How are we supposed to write it?

284
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,180
I'm late.

285
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,130
I thought you weren't coming anymore.

286
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:01,210
Come on in!

287
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,250
- Hai Tao
- Engineer Liu.

288
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,770
- Engineer Liu.
- Xiao Le.

289
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:10,200
- You guys haven't seen him for a while now, have you?
- We do miss him.

290
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,990
- The great God has returned.
- No, no.

291
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:14,240
Today's meeting must be totally confidential.

292
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,230
No one is allowed to take any company phone calls during the meeting.

293
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,520
- Is that clear?
- Got it!

294
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,420
- Got it. Got it.
- Let's go!

295
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,440
- Okay.
- Come!

296
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,790
Come.

297
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:26,130
Director Luo, based on what I know about Huikang and Jieke.

298
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:29,880
The proposals from the two companies this time should be very similar.

299
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,250
They're both responding to Party A's demand to emphasize data collection.

300
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:38,380
So that's why asked you to come back to write for me a new proposal.

301
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:44,050
When I previously explored the project, I realized the channels within are very complex.

302
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:48,730
What if we focused on testing?

303
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:52,110
I have an idea, but it's a bit difficult to implement.

304
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,520
Tell me about it first!

305
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,120
We can use mobile testing.

306
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,210
However, it needs to be supported by cloud computing,

307
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:02,210
such as Fast Future Technology's cloud computing.

308
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:06,810
This Cloud computing already has the advantage in these three projects, I can't reject them fast enough.

309
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:09,860
Do you really think I would choose to work with them?

310
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,170
However, your mobile testing idea is very good.

311
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,010
Keep talking!

312
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:20,890
If you don't use cloud computing, then you can only use a data collection vehicle.

313
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,230
But the data collection vehicle is large in size.

314
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:27,520
We'll have to solve the problems with cooling, and people management.

315
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,970
Moreover, the battery power isn't sufficient, how would you solve them?

316
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:32,410
Also, don't forget usual manual maintenance,

317
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:35,280
as well as the wages to manage it, and the insurance.

318
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,740
If this proposal is used, we'll have to re-calculate the budget.

319
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,560
Data collection vehicles come in large, medium, and small sizes.

320
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,020
The manufacturing cost isn't high, but the processing capability is limited.

321
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:52,590
What about the chips for the data collection equipment, has that been solved?

322
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,360
Where is it?

323
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:00,560
Without the chips, these are all empty ideas.

324
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,710
Xiao Lu, come with me for a second!

325
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:09,510
What is wrong, Sister?

326
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:20,030
Call Wang Yi Nan.

327
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:26,330
Sister Jia, are you sure?

328
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,650
Director Fang, what did you draw?

329
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:42,300
I added a grid to the entire city's underground network of pipes,

330
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:46,160
and added a sensor to every intersection.

331
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,820
This way the details of all the pipelines can be collected at any time.

332
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,700
Director Fang, I'll praise you on something first.

333
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:56,440
This method is the most precise, but also the most stupid.

334
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,320
- Why?
- Have you considered the cost?

335
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,560
The cost comes later, you don't need to worry.

336
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,500
What I need is a stepping stone.

337
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,530
You just tell me if this will work.

338
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:08,570
Of course, it can work.

339
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:11,870
All right, then write it based on this plan.

340
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,500
All right.

341
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,760
Come in!

342
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:35,190
What couldn't you tell me over the phone, Director Luo?

343
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,320
I think the two of us need to collaborate.

344
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,120
The two of us?

345
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:48,170
Sanke's proposal,

346
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:51,630
I want to finalize it as mobile testing and detection.

347
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,930
When did you create this proposal?

348
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,450
It's before I decided to collaborate with you.

349
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,940
Mobile testing and detection.

350
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:12,610
This Zhou Rui really can't get in then.

351
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:19,420
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

352
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,100
Understand?

353
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,120
Understood.

354
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,150
I can help you.

355
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,750
But once we take Sanke,

356
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:38,710
there won't be any other company left in Northern China except Huikang.

357
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:41,130
The two of us will be competing.

358
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:48,160
We'd better discuss the conditions first.

359
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:51,430
I've already promised you,

360
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:54,820
every single one of my orders will have a share for you.

361
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:01,400
It wouldn't still be you having the meat and me drinking the soup, would it?

362
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,870
I'd rather drink the soup.

363
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,480
Can I take a look again?

364
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:23,100
Director Luo, how else can I explain this to you again?

365
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,160
I don't have any merchandise left.

366
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,290
No, wait! Can you understand Chinese?

367
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:30,120
President Tian,

368
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,800
our company has already submitted this proposal.

369
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,450
Your one-sided violation of the agreement will directly impact the result of Huikang's bid.

370
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:38,680
This matter is way beyond several hundred millions of yuan.

371
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,510
Wait! What agreement am I violating?

372
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:43,950
Where is the agreement? When did I enter an agreement with you?

373
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:46,660
That contract has Junior President Liu's signature.

374
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,990
It also has your company's business seal. You are the person legally responsible, aren't you?

375
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:54,080
What? If we don't go to court, you are going to turn around and renege, aren't you?

376
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:00,750
President Tian, do you think this is reasonable?

377
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:05,300
Director Luo, I'm just a guy who does tech.

378
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,990
I'm probably not good at speaking,

379
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:10,180
but I never spout nonsense.

380
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:13,540
Let me tell you! I never saw Huikang's contract.

381
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,090
I've never seen it.

382
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:18,230
Whoever signed it, that's the person whom you should go after.

383
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,870
Are you telling the truth?

384
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:28,570
Heaven is my witness, why would I lie to you?

385
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,940
[Liu Yu Fan]

386
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:53,150
President Tian.

387
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,170
How many chips do you have left in your company's warehouse right now?

388
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:00,470
None! They're all gone.

389
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:03,700
Even the remaining servers have all been taken by Zhou Rui.

390
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,590
Servers without the chips are just a bunch of scrap metal.

391
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,780
Whom do you think you're fooling?

392
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:15,120
Zhou Rui said he can use them as storage devices!

393
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,880
I don't believe it!

394
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,880
Come in!

395
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:26,610
- Presidnet Cui, Jieke's Director of Sales, Fang Wei, is here.
- Come in!

396
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:31,580
Director Fang, this is our company's chairman, Chairman Cui.

397
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,640
Chairman Cui, hello!

398
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,930
Hello. Hello!

399
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,220
This is Jieke's proposal.

400
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:47,070
Chairman Cui, I have studied in detail all the projects that Sanke undertook for the past two years.

401
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:49,700
They are all large-scale civil engineering projects that benefit people's livelihood.

402
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,160
Sanke definitely has compassionate goals.

403
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:56,060
Excuse me! What is your name?

404
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,800
Fang Wei.

405
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,630
Fang Wei.

406
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,880
This proposal wasn't made by Zhou Rui, right?

407
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:09,210
No.

408
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:11,910
I personally led my team in creating this one.

409
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:16,190
Where is Zhou Rui? I'd like to see him.

410
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,880
Director Zhou is—

411
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,460
Director Xiao, are you looking at Huikang's proposal?

412
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,930
Yes.

413
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:26,920
I'd like to bother you

414
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:30,860
to also look at Jieke's one page.

415
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,500
I don't think either of these two proposals is addressing the technical angle.

416
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,030
However, Luo Jia's proposal

417
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:56,000
is more concrete and more comprehensive, isn't it?

418
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:01,710
Oh right, Fang Wei! This is our technical director,

419
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:04,480
Xiao Xiao Yang, Director Xiao.

420
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,880
Hello, Director Xiao!

421
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:23,990
President Cui,

422
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,430
- I'd like to ask you another question.
- Ask away!

423
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:30,420
Do all the sales people you meet understand tech?

424
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,210
Is that a question? Knowing is always better than not knowing.

425
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:36,930
Got it.

426
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:39,440
Thank you.

427
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,960
Director Luo.

428
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,890
Find Liu Yu Fan's company contract for me!

429
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:09,610
All the contracts were locked up by Sister Gu.

430
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:11,330
Have Sister Gu come to talk to me.

431
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:13,680
Sister Gu is on vacation.

432
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,450
Get her here no matter where she is!

433
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,210

436
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:51,300
Sister Gu, tell me if the contract from Liu Yu Fan's company is with you or not.

437
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,880
- Should be.
- There's no "should be!" I need an accurate answer.

438
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,870
I'm abroad and I can't make it back.

439
00:34:55,870 --> 00:35:00,940
In addition, President Lin knows everything about the business with Liu Yu Fan's company.

440
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,190
How about this, Sister Gu?

441
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:07,440
Give me Liu Yu Fan's company's accounting, sales,

442
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,250
legal, and administrative phone numbers all to me, does that work?

443
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:15,260
I asked, "does that work?"

444
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,610
Is there something?

445
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,170
Liu Yu Fan's company said they didn't send us anything.

446
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:28,640
In addition, they never even saw the contract with us.

447
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:33,040
Impossible!

448
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,270
I'll call them right now.

449
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,250
Once we get the Sanke project,

450
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:46,370
if we don't have enough chips to support the project,

451
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:48,720
we'll be committing fraud.

452
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,000
His phone is off?

453
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:56,010
Don't worry! I'll call him non stop.

454
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:01,080
Also, both parties should have a contract.

455
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,960
If they don't have theirs, we still have ours.

456

if Liu Yu Fan doesn't have the chips,

463
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:27,800
this will be a huge problem.

464
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:39,330
Don't you think it's awkward to have him treating us a meal?

465
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,960
This is indeed too awkward.

466
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,560
It isn't that we don't want to show some respect, but this is weird.

Stop talking about it!

473
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:00,420
- If you go, you'll definitely suffer.
- If I go alone, I'll definitely suffer.

474
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:03,740
But if we all go, it'll be something else then, won't it?

475
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:06,850
Go where?

476

Fang Wei is treating us to a meal, but we don't want to go.

However, if you take us,

478
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:18,660
we can tolerate the awkwardness.

At Jieke, except for me,

00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:07,720
For the first meeting, he was really reaching the bottom of the conversation.

486
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,470
If you feel awkward, we'll feel even worse.

487
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:12,130
We waited for too long.

488
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:14,910
- Let's just eat while waiting.
- It's okay. No problem!

489
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:17,860
You all were supposed to eat first anyway, weren't you?

490
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:22,150
How's it going, Bei Yao Yao?

491
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:24,760
Is everything going smoothly at the caravan?

492
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:26,530
[Cui Long]

493
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:27,730
[Dialing]

494
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:29,440
[Cui Long]

495
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,190
How about this? I was late.

496
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:39,060
I'll punish myself with three shots.

497
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:42,100
Here! This first shot

498
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:45,880
is to thank you all for supporting me in the company.

499
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,010
The second shot

500
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:56,930
is for our colleagues in Beijing.

501
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:58,790
Still that same old phrase,

502
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:01,960
"As long as I have wine to drink, you'll have meat on the table!"

503
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:06,240
Fang Wei, why isn't Cui Long here?

504
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,250
He isn't coming.

505
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:13,130
I'm asking you why he isn't coming.

506
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,710
It's because I fired him.

507
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:24,690
Why did you fire him?

508
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:28,260
Ask him yourself!

509
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,910
- This third shot—
- Fang Wei.

510
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:34,560
If you're that good...

511
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:39,650
If you're that good, why don't you fire all of us?

512
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:45,760
When Director Zhou was here, there was a huge layoff.

513
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:51,400
He was... He was like our brother

514
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,830
who protected us, one by one.

515
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,790
I don't have to explain myself.

516
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,780
Since President Chen allowed me to have this position,

517
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,770
then please believe in every decision I make.

518
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:15,420
Who knows if President Chen

519
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:18,020
is regretting this right now?

520
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:22,090
What's with you guys today?

521
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:27,790
We planned on having a good meal together.

522
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,250
I won't win no matter what I do today, will I?

523
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,740
Then you all, tell me!

524
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:38,170
Tell me, what I should do!

525
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,430
How about this?

526
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:57,320
Let's take a shot together!

527
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,790
I'll just pretend like this never happened.

528
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:02,220
Here!

529
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,420
Come on!

530
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:14,220
Sister Yun.

531
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,190
So you don't care about giving or showing respect, do you?

532
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:32,110
I'm done drinking; I have to go.

533
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:34,010
Get up!

534
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:35,840
Let's go!

535
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,900
Come! Let's go!

536
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:44,630
I dare any of you to leave!

537
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:47,750
What? Are we splitting the bill?

538
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:49,180
You're asking for it!

539
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,700
- What are you doing? Stop!
- I'll kill you!

540
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,220
- Don't touch him!
- Come here!

541
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,820
- Stop fighting! Stop fighting!
- I'll kill you!

542
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,920
- Stop fighting!
- Climbing up by stepping on others, aren't you?

543
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,620
- Stop fighting!
- Bei Jian, Bei Jian, don't do it!

544
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,890
You are asking for it!

545
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:03,520
Let go of me!

546
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,680
- I'll stop fighting!
- Let go of me. Let go!

547
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,320
Let go. I'll stop. Let go. Let go!

548
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,610
No more beating. All right.

549
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:15,920
- Keep being crazy!
- You're asking for it!

550
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,170
Please, stop fighting!

551
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:20,420
Stop!

552
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:23,190
You don't have to answer my call

553
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:27,240
or reply to my WeChat, but just let me know

554
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,820
- Stop fighting! Stop beating!
- Director Fang! Director Fang!

555
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,380
if you're still alive.

556
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:35,520
- I ll make you cry!
- Stop fighting! Stop beating!

557
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,570
- Don't stop me!
- Stop it! Stop beating!

558
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:40,600
Stop fighting! Stop fighting, Director Fang!

♫  Leaving behind the roars of the chorus in an empty room  ♫

♫  When those few words reached the tip of the tongue  ♫

572
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:05,150
♫  It would take several years to accept  ♫
