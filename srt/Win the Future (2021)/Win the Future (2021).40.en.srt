Business or personal?

25
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,960
If it's business, discuss it during the bidding.

If it's personal,

27

How did you know something happened to me?

00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,620
Du Heng came to me.

What did he tell you?

32
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,780
It isn't important.

33
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:15,670
Then why did you come back?

00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,960
Where did you go?

35
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,160
You messed up all of my plans.

00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,560
Disappear from my eyesight now!

37
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,880

It's no use.

41
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:55,380
On every false contract in Huikang's system, my signature is there.

42
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,710
I can't escape.

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,880
If I don't win the Sanke project for him this time,

44
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,120
he'll make it so that I'll go to prison.

45
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,380
If you're innocent, then why didn't you call the police?

46
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,790
Why didn't you turn yourself in?

47
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,530
Why should I?

48
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,950
What did I do wrong?

49
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,560
Leave now! I don't want to talk about it anymore.

50
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,350
Listen to me!

51
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,930
From now on,

52
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:40,940
whether the money is yours or not, don't touch it.

53
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,250
Don't check any accounts! Just listen to me.

00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:49,370
Stop everything!

55
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,030
Lastly, we'll call the police.

56
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:56,170
I don't know how much of the false accounting I'm involved in.

57
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,610
I also don't know

58
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:02,630
how much Lin Zhen Wei tampered with the projects that I handled.

59
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,880
I'm really scared.

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,140
Trust me!

61
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,170
It's better to pretend you don't know anything.

62
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,050
Let me handle it!

63
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,440
Will I be in prison for a long time?

64
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:24,450
Trust me! You won't go to prison.

65
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,910
Wait for me!

66
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,890
Why isn't anyone here?

67
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:25,700
Did all of Jieke's sales people go out on the field to sell?

68
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,410
Stop yelling! Am I not some person here?

69
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,720
- Director Cai.
- My goodness!

70
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,760
I just didn't see you for a few days and your stomach is already this big?

71
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,340
Why are you working still?

72
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:42,050
To be honest, my home is far, but the company is close to the hospital.

73
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,060
The doctor said it's just a matter of days for me.

74
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,890
- You...
- Fine!

75
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:51,190
I can discuss with you.

76
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,440
To be honest, I...

77
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,070
have moved to another company that does integrated wiring.

78
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:07,160
I'm thinking if Jieke wins Sanke's project...

79
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,640
I'd like to get the business.

Sorry about that, Director Cai!

81

All of the subcontracts have been completed and confirmed.

82
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:18,440
There is no use talking to me about it.

83
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,520
Then... whom can I talk to about it?

84
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,990
- Director Fang.

- It's Fang Wei.

I don't like you saying that.

00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:16,170
Internationally, it's been recognized as the golden latitude for the development of the cloud computing industry.

520
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:21,260
This is because the annual average temperature here is 4.3 Celsius.

521
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:23,830
Without taking any special measures,

522
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:26,980
the PUE value is under 1.26
(Power Usage Effectiveness)

523
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:31,690
and can further enable the efficiency of a data center.

❝ One Half ❞ by Mo Fei Ding Lu

525
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,870
♫  The sun has only shone halfway  ♫

526
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:57,550
♫  The freckles on my face are bright and dark  ♫

527
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:00,500
♫  Oh...  ♫

528
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:05,860
♫  Who sung the song halfway through  ♫

529
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:11,680
♫  Leaving behind the roars of the chorus in an empty room  ♫

530
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,780
♫  I...  ♫

531
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:21,590
♫  Slowly tidied up the embarrassment of the dispersing crowd  ♫

532
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:29,720
♫  Who would abruptly break off the lingering care of the past?  ♫

533
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,380
♫  You deserved it, someone said  ♫

534
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:43,720
♫  It would be for the best that the story stays unfinished  ♫

535
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:50,420
♫  Those words were spoken halfway  ♫

536
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:54,390
♫  When those few words reached the tip of the tongue  ♫

537
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:57,920
♫  It would take several years to accept  ♫

538
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:04,600
♫  Whose heart is closed midway from now on  ♫

539
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:11,960
♫  Locking up all the endless insomnia in the past?  ♫

540
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:18,750
♫  Some words are only spoken halfway  ♫

541
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:22,670
♫  To adjust the emotional intensity afterwards  ♫

542
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:26,070
♫  Just air-dry it slowly with time  ♫

543
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:32,740
♫  Whose heart will miss a half from now on  ♫

544
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:34,860
♫  Just let it totally submerge  ♫

545
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:41,340
♫  My remaining dimness  ♫

546
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,550
♫  The other half  ♫

547
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:53,450
♫  The other half  ♫

548
00:45:57,250 --> 00:46:00,350
♫  The other half  ♫
