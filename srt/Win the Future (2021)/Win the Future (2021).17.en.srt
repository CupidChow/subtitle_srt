00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,460
Grandma,

22
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,120
I mixed several different flavors, you can try them.

23
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,660
What's the matter?

24
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,940
Nothing! Just work.

25
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,540
Actually, when it comes to drinking tea,

26
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,780
Southerners don't have any rules.

27
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,290
It's mainly because there are too many varieties, too many different ones.

28
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:25,160
From this... Eight Treasure Tea to Kung Fu Tea

29
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,860
and from flower teas to Pur-Er Tea,

30
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,160
then there's today's western-style black tea.

31
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,060
It's actually alway just been following what's popular.

32
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,170
There's never been our own way of drinking it.

33
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,110
As for me,

34
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,660
I prefer drinking

35
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,290
British black tea.

36
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,830
It's like life.

37
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:51,580
Put some sugar in, it's sweet.

38
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:55,540
Put some milk in, it smells richer.

39
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,750
However, for the flavors of life,

40
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,760
you need to rely on yourself to find.

41
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,170
Here! Try this.

42
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,250
- How about it?
- It tastes good.

43
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:27,370
Let me tell you! It'll taste even better with some cake.

44
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,600
Do you usually drink tea?

45
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,000
I don't drink tea much.

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,870
We usually drink coffee to get more energy.

47
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:44,150
Who told you drinking tea was to find energy?

48
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,430
Isn't this what all those TV ads say?

49
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,810
Let me rephrase it for you this way!

50
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,810
Idle people drink tea.

51
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:58,000
Rich people or people who have no time, drink coffee.

52
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,230
Grandma,

53
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,210
you really shouldn't beat around the bush to criticize people.

54
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,610
Did you get in a fight with your boyfriend yesterday?

55

You're spending time with this old woman.

58
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:25,720
It must be because your boyfriend doesn't have time to spend with you.

59

00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:25,240
I didn't realize you were so boring.

163
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,710
Then what do you think we should do?

164
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:37,210
Do you really want to refuse to forsake darkness for light

165
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,890
and be acquired by my company?

166
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,450
To be honest, it would be good for you and for us.

167
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,080
If Huikang acquires Jieke,

168
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,100
then we would become coworkers.

169
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,030
You weren't willing for that to happen, were you?

170
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,400
But now, I've changed my mind.

171
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,570
I sincerely invite you to join Huikang.

172
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,730
I understand your sincerity.

173
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,720
but I can't do it.

174
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:18,720
The people at your company already met with Zhang Min Cheng in private, don't think that I don't know.

175
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,480
I wasn't planning on hiding it from you.

176
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,050
But let me tell you! On future work-related issues,

177
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:32,210
I might irritate you.

178
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,730
Bring it on!

179
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:40,110
There's no way you could steal any of my clients.

180
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,940
You're so beautiful.

181
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,690
It's because you have a pair of eyes that can discover beauty.

182
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,680
Is that so?

183
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:57,660
- Let's eat!
- I'll watch you eat.

184
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,040
You're pretty when you eat.

185

Director Mei who works under Zhang Min Cheng.

189
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:33,150
The greeting gifts sent by Wang Yi Nan are extremely effective on our Hangzhou clients.

190
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:35,150
Got it?

191
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,590
You have to be careful of him.

192
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,980
I'm determined to acquire Jieke.

193
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,200
We can't let them come back from behind.

194
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,020
Chairman Zhang is loyal.

195
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,470
The fact that he's asked to meet me at this time

196
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,780
is to help everyone loosen up a bit.

197
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:53,980
That's why we can't let them have Zhang Ming Cheng or any of the Hangzhou clients.

- What's the situation over there?

I was there at their office this morning.

- You have to follow up.
- If I go meet Chairman Zhang right now, what should I say?

Based on the relationship between Chairman Zhang and Huikang, will he accept our proposal just like that?

There's no rush to talk about the proposal. Just listen!

Understand the client's pain point.

Once you understand their pain point, then you go straight to the point with the solution.

Remember! For clients,

Does knowing Ye Chao Dong's next moves mean anything to us?

323
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,510
As soon as he moves to Hangzhou,

324
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:26,400
it proves that Zhou Rui has started his strategic counterattack.

325
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,950
Office morale in Jieke East China office is very low.

326
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:33,710
- I don't think they have any power to fight back at all.
- Is that what you think?

327
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,680
Has Zhou Rui ever played by the book?

328
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:40,280
Anyone with a brain should know to look for another strategic point right now.

329
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:47,860
Wang Yi Nan, do you know what saying really isn't worth listening to?

330
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:50,090
Even if it's not worthy, I still have to say it.

331
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,100
However, I already heard what you said.

332
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,660
Thanks!

333
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,820
What's the point for having a brain?

334
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:10,610
You need courage and insight.

335
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:16,510
Director Zhou! Director Zhou?

336
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:20,040
Director Zhou, what do you need from me?

337
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,040
First, don't let anyone know my whereabouts.

338
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,030
Second, you need to keep an eye on Wang Yi Nan and Luo Jia's every move.

339
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:29,100
Work with everyone and find the best opportunity.

340
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,860
Got it!

341
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,770
Then what about Liu Yu Fan?

342
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:37,050
Liu Yu Fan? Let go of it for a bit.

343
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:46,100
Fang Wei, do you know what our biggest threat is right now?

344
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,370
It's that our opponent knows about our bottomline.

345
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:55,190
Zhang Ming Cheng, Chairman Zhang, how important he is to Huikang

346
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,920
you don't need me to tell you, do you?

347
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,780
When Luo Jia started her move, none of you could match her.

348
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,850
That's why we need to work closely, playing Wolf-pack tactics.

349
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:09,430
This is the only way to block Huikang's every single exit.

350
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,700
I understand the reason,

351
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,460
but I won't let go of Liu Yu Fan.

352
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:19,520
Liu Yu Fan is in the open; Huikang is in the dark.

353
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,300
Don't you understand this light and dark?

354
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:25,730
- I understand.
- Then go and do it if you do!

355
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,950
Hello! I want to confirm a piece of news.

356
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:45,580
Is Ye Chao Dong filling Yang Lu's position?

357
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,900
Didn't we set our rules?

358
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,000
But I can tell you this time. That's correct!

359
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,260
With Ye Chao Dong's abilities, can he keep the East China office?

360
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,020
Don't underestimate anybody!

361

Where are you?

362

363
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:06,490
I'm guessing right now, you

364
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:10,610
should be preparing for your meeting with Zhang Ming Cheng.

365
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,360

Hello.

368
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,250
I'm Director Luo Jia's assistant from Huikang.

369
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:55,860
- I'm here today to meet with Director Mei.
- Director Mei isn't meeting anybody today.

370
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,850
Then can I sit here and wait for him?

371
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:01,560
Help yourself!

372
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:20,950
Director Mei!

373
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,870
Xiao Cui, you really came.

374
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:30,850
Not only that I came, I also drove the car here for you.

375
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,300
No...

376
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,120
No rush!

377
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,650
This is a rear-wheel drive, you need to step hard on the brakes.

378
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:39,000
Or it'll be easy to fall on your butt.

379
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,600
Director Mei, rush forward!

380
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,740
Director Mei, keep it up!

381
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,570
Director Mei, accelerate!

382
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:07,610
Keep it up!

383
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,330
- How is it, Director Mei?
- Cool!

384
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:30,080
You dad must have paid a lot for this car.

385
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,440
My dad said, money in the pocket is just paper.

386
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,090
Only when it's spent, it's called money.

387
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:39,320
It's a special knowledge to know how to spend money.

388
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,060
Director Mei,

389
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:44,110
look at this sports car!

390
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:46,730
It looks expensive, doesn't it?

391
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:49,280
If I didn't tell you, you wouldn't know.

392
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,600
I rented it.

393
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,550
Rented?

394
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:55,340
No.

395
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,810
You're a wealthy heir, yet you still have to rent cars?

396
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,460
We're living in different times.

397
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,680
Many people can afford this kind of sports car.

398
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,220
It's more important to drive different models now.

399
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,930
However, if you buy different models, it'll be too costly and not worth it.

400
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:10,000
Director Mei, let me calculate it for you.

401
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,220
This sports car is about three million.

402
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,320
I drive it for a year and then sell it.

403
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,880
At most, I can sell it for two million.

404
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,090
My loss is one million over all.

405
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:22,540
But if you rent this sports car, it's only three thousand yuan a day.

406
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:25,740
If you probably drive it for eight months in a year. How much do you think it costs?

407
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:28,350
Moreover, you can also change the model when you rent.

408
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:30,840
You don't even have to pay for the maintenance and insurance.

409
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,620
Don't you think it's good?

410
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:35,510
It's good!

411
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,590
Brother Mei, look at this!

412
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:41,870
The principle of renting cars is about the same as purchasing other products.

413
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:44,550
For example, you've been collaborating with Huikang all this time.

414
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:46,470
You're already used to it.

415
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:49,650
You've developed a tolerance for their products.

416
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:53,170
At this time, if you change to collaborate with another company,

417
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:56,630
get some new ideas, you'll definitely receive a new surprise.

418
00:33:56,630 --> 00:34:00,930
What surprise will Jieke give me then?

419
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:05,650
It'll definitely be beyond your expectations and guaranteed to satisfy you.

420
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,430
Let's go then! Go to my office to talk.

421
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:19,430
Director Mei, do you know that the sports car is even related to your personality.

422
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:22,800
- Is that so?
- What color would you choose if you were about to discuss a project?

423
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,620
I chose yellow on purpose.

424
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,940
It's because it symbolizes willfulness, being different.

425
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,340
- It suits you and your personality perfectly—
- Director Mei. Director Mei!

426
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:33,530
- What?
- I'm Director Luo's assistant of Huikang.

My name is Kong Le Le.

428
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,470
Director Luo asked me to bring this to you.

429
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:39,770
Go back and thank your Director Luo.

430
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:41,160
I still have a guest here.

431
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,230
We'll talk another day.

432
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,940
Director Mei, she's bribing you.

433
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:48,200
Is Huikang playing the Three Axes game?

Who do they think our noble Director Mei is?

435

443

Why are you so anxious?

00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:52,650
How will you handle it next then?

481
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:54,340
Scumbag.
[End call]

482
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,130
Director Luo! Sorry that I couldn't deliver the gift.

483
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,250
Everyone from Unit A, immediately prepare to go on assignment.

484
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:13,470
- Director Luo, where are we going?
- Hangzhou.

485
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,930
- Right now?
- Yes, right now.

486
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:16,420
What should we bring and for how long?

487
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,970
Laptops. I don't know for how long.

488
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:28,390
Excuse me, Director Cai! Let me take this call.

489
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:33,790
What's up? I'm talking business.

490
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,770
Don't call me! You hear?

491
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:43,410
- Director Cai, about our contract—
- Xiao Wang.

492
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:46,930
Being a good sister, I'll show you something today.

493
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,450
Jieke Company's Xiao Yu

494
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:53,180
gave me this proposal.

495
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:56,780
Look at them!

496
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:02,150
From the proposed solution to the post-installation service, I'm very satisfied with it all.

497
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:07,950
Their quote is about the same as your company's.

498
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:11,670
Tell me! If you were me,

499
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,530
what would you do?

500
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,860
Director Cai, I came from Jieke.

501
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,820
This doesn't look like Jieke's style.

502
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:26,660
You... Are you staying I'm showing you someone else's proposal to pressure you?

503
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:30,910
Sister, that isn't... that isn't what I mean.

504
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:32,640
Look—

505
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:36,150
[Director Luo]

506
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,060
Hello, Director Luo?

507
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,720
Where are you?

508
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,990
- I'm discussing a proposal with Director Cai right now.
- Come back to the company immediately.

509
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,930
We're going to Hangzhou today on business.

510
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:50,430
- Do I have to go?
- You must.

511
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:53,490
Also, give me info on the clients whose orders Yang Lu held back.

512
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:55,370
The more detailed, the better.

513
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:10,460
Excuse me, Sister! I have to go on a sudden business trip.

514
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:16,110
No matter how attractive the proposal from Jieke is,

515
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:20,120
I plead with you not to rush into deciding on the bid.

516
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,680
We can discuss the details further, okay?

517
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,460
Then I'll have to go back to report on this.

518
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:38,350
A limited edition bag?

519
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:43,150
I don't understand! They say there are only a few in the whole country.

520
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:44,760
Just carry it for fun.

521
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,650
They say accepting a gift is the happiest time for a woman.

522
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:52,280
How could I refuse happiness?

523
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:57,030
Sister, you can't refuse happiness.

524
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:59,110
This is so well said.

525
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:01,360
Remember this!

526
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:05,820
After I do the report, our company can still act very fast in following the process.

527
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:09,080
Understood! Then I...

528
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,790
Go on!

529
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:48,550
