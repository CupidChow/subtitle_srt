[Episode 36]

22
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,470
I'm quite impressed with you as an influencer.

23
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,240
You said you'd make it, and you did.

24
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,060
No wonder Huikang has come so far.

25
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,590
Huikang is like my son.

26
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,270
As a father, I'm always thinking of how

27
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,830
I can help my son reach even greater heights before I retire.

28
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:13,770
Let him see from higher heights, and walk for longer distances.

29
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,140
If it weren't for this, then tell me,

30
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,730
why would I make such painstaking sacrifices at my age?

31
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,440
You shouldn't look at it this way.

32
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,690
As a father, it's natural for you to do things for your son.

33
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,480
As a father, Liu Feng should be

34
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,680
quite satisfied with this large gift.

35
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,940
It's still a big gift now, but it might become a bomb in the future.

36
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,750
I've seen too many of these kinds of entrepreneurs.

37
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,720
They're excellent at managing their tens of thousands of employees,

38
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,420
but can't manage the three to five family members they have at home.

39
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,960
I want to reduce expenditures on the account.

40
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,160
- That won't work, President Chen.
- Not that!

41
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,820
What I'm talking about are fixed assets, reducing the amount of depreciation.

42
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,220
That way, the profits will look good.

43
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,180
This isn't easily done typically.

44
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,330
Then reduce the amount of depreciation and amortization.

45
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,680
After the method of depreciation is confirmed, it usually cannot be changed.

46
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,110
- Fine then.
- But I can adjust it slightly.

47
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:34,290
Fast's financial statement this month reports two point two million yuan in receivables.

48
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,680
We're finally seeing some returns.

49
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,410
Master, this can't be thought of in that way.

50
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,630
Annual users accounted for sixty five percent of this month's revenue,

51
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,760
which means that in this two point two million,

52
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,030
nearly one point four million will have to be spread evenly across each month of the next year.

53
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,260
The operations of cloud computing aren't very stable.

54
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,320
I cannot guarantee that every month will bring in returns of this scale.

55
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,000
In addition, this is just gross revenue; we still haven't deducted the costs yet.

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,990
So I dare not think about profits yet, at least, not this year.

57
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,250
You're starting to calculate the economics of it?

58
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,120
That shows that you're still reserved.

59
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,370
The Internet is a money-burning industry.

60
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm sure everyone understands that.

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,590
Is there any reason to linger on one's last breath?

62
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,230
You don't want to sit and wait for death,

63
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,420
but this method is literally just awaiting death.

64
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:29,130
Master! Master, this isn't waiting for death.

65
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,460
Every day, I can see a limitless amount of resources coming in.

66
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,320
I see lots of new hope.

67
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,120
There is hope every day.

68
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,510
Then how are you going to prove it to the Board of Directors?

69
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,930
That the money you've burned through has value.

70
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:44,440
Master, I... I see that

71
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,900
I have access to unlimited resources.

72
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:52,020
Besides, I developed these resources bit by bit on my own.

73
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:59,030
You didn't answer my calls or attend the Board of Directors meeting,

74
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,240
was it because of this?

75
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,260
Not entirely.

76
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:13,430
If, and I'm just saying if,

77
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,260
you...

78
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:20,160
take over operations in Beijing and Northern China,

79
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,290
and since East China is already your base operations,

80
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,470
isn't this kind of stage

81
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,030
the resource you've always dreamed of?

82
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,360
It originally was,

83
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,630
but not anymore.

84
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,730
- Why?
- Because as a salesperson,

85
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:43,320
if someone else having control over your lifeblood, it's a terrible feeling.

86
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,750
I want a feeling of stability.

87
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,990
A caravan?

88
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,430
Yes. A caravan.

89
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:58,910
Your two point two million in one month,

90
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,560
and sixty five percent of that has to be spread out across an entire year of income.

91
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:08,040
Master, it doesn't look good now,

92
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,340
but its future will definitely be vast.

93
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,550
What are you base on to have such confidence?

94
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,490
What's supporting me now isn't Jieke,

95
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,470
nor is it O&T.

96
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:26,340
It's every single one of the end-users whom I can see and touch.

97
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,640
- The feeling I get is very stable.
- Stable?

98
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,940
The kind of stability that lets you sleep until morning.

99
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:40,080
The word "stability" in the world of sales is a total nonsense.

100
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:47,420
You must take over our operations in the Beijing, North China, and East China markets.

101
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,300
This was the decision made by the Board of Directors.

102
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,450
- Fang Wei will assist you in your work.
- No.

103
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,350
I refuse to accept.

104
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:59,180
If I have to prove something to the Board of Directors,

105
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,340
then give me a caravan.

106
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,070
The caravan is my only chance.

107
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,770
You first.

108
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:18,400
Why did the young President Liu want to meet with the two of us together?

109
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,200
I don't like to beat around the bush.

110
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,020
I've already started talking about pricing with Fang Wei, but I've always been fair.

111
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,840
The price that I give Jieke, will also be the price I give to Huikang.

112
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,500
Then at this moment, I cannot sign this contract.

113
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,770
Director Zhou, what do you mean by this?

114
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:35,530
I have to first understand the specifications of your chip.

115
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:46,890
This is the most recent quality inspection report published by our chip company.

116
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:50,620
- There's no issue with quality.
- There are some domestic chips in here.

117
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,480
- Their performance is only a bit behind the level of imported chips, and—
- Are they compatible with the servers?

118
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,590
Yes. No problem.

119
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:02,040
[Equipment Inspection Conclusion]
[Chip is consistent with technical specifications performed on-site, and is an acceptable product with a service life of three years and they meet delivery requirements.]

120
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,060
The service life is on the shorter side.

121
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:09,830
That's true! I admit it.

122
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,610
On a moral principle, about being the domestic chips,

123
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:15,130
we must support it.

124
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,340
- What about the price?
- Price?

125
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,620
The price was agreed to in the discussion with Fang Wei.

126
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,490
The unit price is forty six hundred RMB.

127
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:25,490
I cannot disclose the specific volume to Director Luo, so how many does Huikang want?

128
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,750
The imported chip's unit price ranges from twenty six hundred to fifty six hundred RMB

129
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,760
You're catching up to the prices of imported chips.

130
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,350
Let's be clear about this!

131
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:38,070
You're the ones coming to me to buy my chips.

132
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:40,620
I naturally have the right to set the price.

133
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,870
I can lower the price a little based on your order quantity.

134
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,720
- However—
- Young President Liu, I think I need to go and find other suppliers.

135
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:52,690
Young President Liu, I can't negotiate on your price.

136
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,370
Customers never belong to the company.

137
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:14,900
However, every customer is in the hands of you, salespeople.

138
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,390
The boss always listen to the customers.

139
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:22,240
So ultimately, the boss has to listen to you, salespeople.

140
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,110
Director Luo is here.

141
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,760
Take a seat!

142
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,390
I want to chat with you.

143
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,100
Okay. The meeting is adjourned.

144
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,480
President Lin.

145
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,300
This young President Liu is fierce.

146
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,880
Their company's President Tian already clearly said that they aren't selling the chips to us.

147
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,930
Just a word and the price was reported to you.

148
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:08,700
People who are hungry don't have many requirements.

149
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,580
We have a need, and he can satisfy our needs.

150
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,340
It's an abnormal time right now, so don't be so serious.

151
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:18,400
Don't you always say to give mutual benefits?

152
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,020
I don't see what benefit we'll receive from this.

153
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,710
You must look at it long-term.

154
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:28,380
Isn't this how the internet field always is?

155
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,060
As a downstream company,

156
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,960
it always has to safeguard its relationship with an upstream company.

157
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,120
Wait! When did this young President Liu become our upstream?

158
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,910
He is nothing, but his dad, Liu Feng, is.

159
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,030
Then there should be at least a bottom line, shouldn't it?

160
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,650
He still can't ask for sky-high prices, can he?

161
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,820
That's the reason why

162
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,310
I need you to take charge and control it.

163
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:00,560
Remember the principle! Three words: Quickly sign it!

164
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,400
Come in!

165
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:34,000
Regarding my purchasing the chips from Liu Yu Fan, did you already know about it?

166
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,900
I know you want to help me.

167
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,300
Thank you, but I can handle it myself.

168
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,300
Handle it? It's such a high price.

169
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,100
Do you think it's been resolved?

170
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,000
Don't rush to agree to the first quote!

171
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,800
Of course, I know it wasn't easy for you.

172
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,600
However, someone has to play the good guy, and someone else plays the bad guy.

173
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,800
Director Zhou, I already said it.

174
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,000
I can take care of it myself.

175
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:05,220
I really don't want to smell you everywhere.

176
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,800
Okay. I understand.

177
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,300
I won't get in touch with Li Yu Fan again.

178
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,000
Director Zhou, the suppliers initially have been changing every second.

179
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,970
They change eight times a day.

180
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,900
In addition, you shouldn't forget

181
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,300
how Luo Jia treated us with Guo Han's order.

182
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,800
People in sales

183
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:39,630
fear this kind of situation the most.

184
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,800
The fisherman takes advantage of the fight between the snipe and the clam.

185
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,500
You have Fast.

186
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,500
You have the big caravan and your cloud computing.

187
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,000
You have so much, aren't you satisfied still?

188
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Is it that... Is it that your name must be carved into every order at Jieke

189
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,200
before you're satisfied?

190
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,700
Director Fang,

191
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,380
I need to correct you.

192
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,800
The big caravan isn't mine.

193
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,400
Fast isn't mine, either.

194
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,100
Cloud computing doesn't belong to any one person.

195
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,900
The orders that you and I have, all belong to Jieke.

196
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,000
Working in sales,

197
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,500
your sensibility is more important than your abilities.

198
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,410
This is where Director Wei failed.

199
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:39,050
[Fu'An East Rd]

200
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:12,290
The IT department said that you've been using the space bar in place of the tab.

201
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,200
It looks like it's true.

202
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:19,700
The sales department people say you use this kind of hypocritical point to determine if someone is technical.

203
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,800
That seems to be true, too.

204
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,300
You're already President Tian, but you still insist on coding it yourself.

205
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,000
It isn't easy.

206
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,000
Are you here representing yourself or Jieke?

207
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,800
If you represent yourself, we can be nostalgic and chat a little.

208
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,300
If you're representing Jieke, the door is over there.

209
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,040
I'm not representing anyone.

210
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,100
I only want to ask about the chips. Really!

211
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,500
I'm asking for myself and it has nothing to do with Jieke.

212
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,300
You have no problems, but I do.

213
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,500
I joined Jieke right after graduating from college.

214
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,600
I spent fifteen years in Jieke's Technical Department.

215
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,000
I saw so many people come and go.

216
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,500
It's true that our technology can't make its talents stay.

217
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,500
A bigshot like you already changed to sales.

218
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,100
I'm a weakling.

219
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,650
Any profession that I want to change to,

220
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,800
it's like a toad wanting to eat the swan.

221
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,600
I haven't thought of it like that.

222
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,900
Since you've been at Jieke for so many years

223
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,000
I believe you deserve merit for working hard even if you don't have any achievement.

224
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Don't talk to me about that!

225
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:29,000
Is there such recognition for working hard in Jieke?

226
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,300
I have a wife and a child, and you guys just fired me whenever you want to!

227
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,950
What is your rule?

228
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,900
People without achievements must scramble!

229
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,200
I'm sorry!

230
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,600
I suddenly don't know what to say.

231
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,600
Actually, you do know everything.

232
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,130
Chen Ming Kai is old-fashioned and shortsighted.

233
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,000
He takes up the toilet but doesn't sh*t.

234
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,600
Jieke being in this stagnant situation is all because of him!

235
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,600
Enough.

236
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,200
I can't keep listening to this, President Tian.

237
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,000
Jieke has wronged you.

238
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,430
I can't represent Jieke to apologize to you,

239
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,500
but Cheng Ming Kai is my master.

240
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,300
You shouldn't talk about my master like that in front of me.

241
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,800
Good bye!

242
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,000
Zhou Rui!

243
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,200
Zhou Rui.

244
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,300
I'm telling you right now.

245
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,030
I was the one who caused the fire alarm incident in Jieke.

246
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,600
I also know that you and Cheng Ming Kai

247
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,200
said not to investigate further.

248
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,540
How do you think we should handle this?

249
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:38,200
Let's not investigate it further!

250
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,000
What do you think?

251
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,590
Let bygones be bygones!

252
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,200
Really!

253
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,400
You're right.

254
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,300
All these years, no one has listened to me vent and dump all the trash.

255
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,700
Now that I've let it all out, I feel much better.

256
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,400
Understood.

257
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,400
You can ask.

258
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,000
Other than the price, I can tell you everything about the chips.

259
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I can discuss the pricing with Liu Yu Fan.

260
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,200
What I want to ask is the chip's source of production,

261
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,090
brand, channels, and basic parameters.

262
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,590
I don't have any new chips.

263
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,900
I took them off from the servers.

264
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,600
Took off?

265
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,600
Were the chips in the CPU?

266
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,400
How many do you still have?

267
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,600
The ones already taken off are about eight hundred.

268
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:39,000
The ones that haven't been taken off, I estimate to be less than two thousand.

269
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,200
Thanks.

270
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,400
When you change that bad habit of yours, you can come to find me at Fast.

271
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,600
Maybe we can do something big.

272
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,200
I really don't want to do anything big.

273
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,800
Grandma

274
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,000
Alright, here!

275
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,700
Wait a moment, wait a moment, wait a moment.

276
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,900
Grandma,

277
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,400
matching it with your gray hair...

278
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,200
So pretty! I want to dye my hair the same color. So fashionable.

279
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,600
See? Didn't I say so before?

280
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:53,800
You're just like Ungrateful Child who likes to make fun of me.

281
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,440
Who is making fun of you?

282
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,500
You really look pretty.

283
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,000
- Looks good?
- Grandma,

284
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,300
you rushed me to come back to comb your hair,

285
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,500
and draw your eyebrows and lips.

286
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,400
What are you planning to do?

287
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,200
Alright, don't move!

288
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,000
Okay. Very good!

289
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,200
- Let us take a look!
- All right.

290
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,600
They look good.

291
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,800
Here! Let's do a few more.

292
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,800
Grandma,

293
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,400
why do you suddenly want to take photos?

294
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,640
It's no fun taking pictures by yourself.

295
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,600
It depicts loneliness.

296
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,000
You can see that in this picture, there are two people.

297
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,600
When you look at it, you'll feel that

298
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,200
these two people must have a story together.

299
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,400
- Grandma, you should've told me earlier.
- Here. Give me that one.

300
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,400
If you told me, I would've taken you out to take assorted photos.

301
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,200
I think differently than you.

302
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,600
I don't want to take pictures with the scenery.

303
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,200
I want to take pictures with people.

304
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,290
All right. Here.

305
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:11,400
Actually, what I really want

306
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,000
is to take pictures with Ungrateful Child.

307
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,300
The three of us.

308
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,800
Okay. Not bad!

309
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,400
Chairman Liu.

310
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,500
Sit!

311
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,800
The zero dollar case that Zhou Riu did, it's those three, isn't it?

312
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,800
That's right.

313
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,400
Are you playing the Romance of the Three Kingdoms?

314
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,600
The global trend is what is long unified will be divided, and what is long divided will be unified.

315
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,700
It's fine to be unified.

316
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,800
If you agree to do public cloud computing, I'll agree immediately.

317
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,600
If you also accept Huikang, I'll agree to any cloud.

318
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,800
Let me repeat why I've asked everyone to be here!

319
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,900
Our O&T is doing private cloud

320
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:23,000
in order to guarantee data security in our supply chain.

321
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,100
Chairman Liu, the nature of cloud (computing) is about the interconnection of everything.

322
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,000
If you only do private clouds,

323
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,730
then it's essentially buying their own servers just like before.

324
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,900
There is no different from everyone.

325
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:40,000
O&T is definitely big in the field with more than ten supply chains.

326
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,100
But compared to the market, it's still considered small.

327
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,700
Market?

328
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,900
The foundation of the market is customers.

329
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:51,600
Cloud computing's market is only ten percent of all the internet users.

330
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,800
It's ten percent as of right now.

331
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,000
What data do you use to talk about the market then?

332
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,800
Time.

333
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,600
Zhou Rui, the "time" you're talking about requires money.

334
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,400
- Our Fast right now—
- Chairman Liu,

335
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,000
didn't you say we need to see what happens in the future?

336
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,070
Are they the future?

337
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,200
Come to find me again when you three have it all straightened out.

338
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,000
However, O&T must do private cloud.

339
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,600
Chairman Liu.

340
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,200
President Lin, please stop!

341
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,600
What are you stirring up here?

342
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,400
I've been eating all the leftovers.

343
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,460
Even the tendon is growing on you.

344
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,500
That isn't right, is it?

345
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,900
Let me tell you this! It isn't easy for me to help,

346
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,400
but it's too easy for me to ruin something.

347
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,500
By the way, Zhou Rui. I need to officially tell you that

348
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,200
Cao Tian You is my younger brother-in-law.

349
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,600
I'm also a shareholder in Fast.

350
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,230
Chairman Liu.

351
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:09,180
The second you mention Huikang Co.,

352
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,410
I'll turn around and leave.

353
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:14,670
Then I want to talk to you about young President Liu.

354
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,690
Are you still going to leave?

355
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:22,940
I warned you many times to stay away from my son.

356
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,700
Are you going to act deaf?

357
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,860
I really can't avoid mentioning Huikang.

358
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,640
The chip company that young President Liu invested in,

359
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,640
Huikang has been the one promoting it.

360
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:39,830
Then let me try to make both you and Huikang disappear together.

361
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:43,250
Rest assured! As long as you accept my company,

362
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,110
you'll never see me again.

363
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:49,670
I told you before

364
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,650
the caravan will make money.

365
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,430
Did you even earn a cent?

366
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,990
It's free! It's free! They are all free.

367
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:00,150
I am afraid that before I see my return on my investment,

368
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:03,130
I would've said goodbye to this world.

369
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,450
I was wrong about you.

370
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:09,170
I initially thought you were different from the others.

371
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:12,560
Those people watch as buildings get built and destroyed.

372
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,690
It turns out you are the same as the others.

373
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:18,630
You believe in getting rich overnight, but it's impossible! This needs time!

374
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:21,360
It's fine even if it's one night or ten nights.

375
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,250
You need to at least let me become rich first, don't you?

376
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:26,440
- Do you still know to come back?
- Grandma, I—

377
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,480
- How dare you go out and play the second you get out of school?
- Grandma!

378
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,810
- You wouldn't come home unless you're hungry, Zhou Zhi Di!
- Grandma, what are you doing? I'm Zhou Rui!

379
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:34,580
I'll beat you, Zhou Zhi Di! I'm going to beat you!

I'm a Goddess. Okay?

385
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,510

386
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,610

387
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:59,170
Nothing.

- Let me see.
- I'm fine.

Come here. Come here!

I'm really fine, Grandma.

Let me take a look!

395
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:32,650
My Ungrateful Child, who beat you up?

396
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:35,760
It isn't like that. I accidentally bumped into something.

397
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,760
How is this a bump? These are clearly marks from a feather duster.

398
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,070
Grandma, what century is this? Are there still feather dusters?

399
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:46,940
I was playing with some coworkers and accidentally hurt myself.

400
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,020
Which coworker?

401
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:53,390
The ones at the housewarming party? Take me to them now!

402
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:57,400
Grandma, how old is your grandson?

403
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,620
Are you going to go tell them off?

404
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,450
Whenever you got bullied as a child,

405
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:05,760
Wasn't I the one who took you to reason with them?

406
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,030
Tell me! I'll—

408
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,700

416

- What is it?
- My family went bankrupt.

00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:48,860
I need money, lots of money.

418
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,350
Bankrupt means you have no money anymore?

419
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:57,020
Not only do I not have money, but I also owe other people a lot of money.

420
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:01,500
- Then did you tell Bei Yao Yao yet?
- No, I haven't heard from her.

In this world, there are three kinds of things that are difficult to say.

457
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,560
The first is to ask for money.

458

The second is to say "I love you."

459

The third is to break up.

For the two of us, it can only be the third one.

Then I have to ask you for the reason.

I'm done over here.

Grandma, when did you know that you were sick?

500
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:48,420
I already knew it before I came to Beijing.

501
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:56,630
Then why didn't you tell me?

502
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:03,270
Don't you also have a lot of things you don't tell me?

503
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,640
Grandma,

504
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,530
let's look for an expert.

505
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:20,840
Alzheimer's disease takes a long time to develop.

506
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,890
You'll be okay.

507
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:29,690
What can an expert do?

508
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:34,360
Growing old and dying is a very common part of life.

509
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,440
You need to learn how to face them.

510
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:41,080
Then... Then all right. We'll face it.

511
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,880
The doctor already said that

512
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,070
you'll have to stay at the hospital.

513
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,700
Stay at the hospital!

514
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,750
Alright, I'll listen to you.

515
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,610
- Let me call Luo Jia.
- No!

516
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:03,880
One less person who knows

517
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:08,500
is one less person who needs to worry.

518
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:25,900
This plan was prepared so well.

519
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,690
True.

520
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:30,280
- Have you decided?
- If I were to say...

521
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,670
We should still bargain a bit more.

522
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:35,130
Look! Calculate it again.

523
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:37,830
Recalculate it.

524
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,980
We can consider cutting our prices

525
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:45,100
but so can our competitors.

526
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:49,580
We can write a beautiful proposal, but so can our competitors.

527
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:52,910
I think that if we want to win the bid, we first must consider

528
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:57,590
what do we have that our competitor doesn't.

529
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,800
We have Luo Jia in the North.

530
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:04,850
- Or the opposite.
- Alright.

531
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:08,180
Then let's talk about what is it that we don't have.

532
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:12,620
[Luo Jia of the North]

533
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,660
Cloud computing.

534
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:21,200
Cloud computing?
[South...]

535
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,890
[South X X]

536
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,920
Then I'll go first.

537
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,940
The words, "Cloud Computing,"

538
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,450
indeed sounds good,

539
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:48,810
but it only sounds good.

540
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,790
Cloud computing isn't omnipotent.

541
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:53,830
It also can't be explained by a few pages.

542
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:57,010
Unless the client only wants to sell a concept,

543
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:59,670
skin the tiger, or do something big.

544
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:02,720
Then what is something unique that only we have?

545
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,330
The unique analysis of the client's core needs.

546
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:11,300
Continue!

547
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:16,680
If the client is an enterprise, profit is their core demand.

548
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,570
If they are the government,

549
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:26,100
this is what makes this project different than others.

550
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:30,830
We're facing a client whose core demand isn't profit.

551
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:34,230
Then lowering the price is good,

552
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,420
or making the plan transparent is also good.

553
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:39,300
It seems none of them is hitting the target.

554
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,470
I think Wang Yi Nan's approach is very nice.

555
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:44,100
It isn't overly aggressive, nor too conservative.

556
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,800
Balance is the most important.

557
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,650
You're so right.

558
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:50,330
Cloud Computing's proposal must be too radical.

559
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:52,250
In addition, planting dots everywhere

560
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:54,460
is indeed too conservative.

561
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:59,360
It's not only that.

562
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,460
Take a great leader such as Cui Gao Rui as an example.

563
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:04,860
Other than considering controlling the cost and implementing projects,

564
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,130
he definitely weighs the advantages and disadvantages.

565
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,930
For enterprises like ours, what we consider is profit.

566
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:13,230
For leaders working in the government,

567
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:15,250
they also consider something else.

568
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:18,120
Employment.

569
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:22,800
Employment?

570
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,720
What's wrong with that?

571
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,690
Let me ask you a question!

572
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:30,970
Can't other companies think of

573
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:33,750
the unique trait of a government project?

574
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:36,980
You just answered the question yourself.

575
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:39,120
What was it?

576
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:42,560
Right.

577
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:47,370
"We have our own unique analysis for the clients' needs,"

578
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:48,720
haven't we?

579
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,920
- That's right.
- President Lin.

580
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,120
Okay.

581
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,040
I'll just say a few final words.

582
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:04,120
In order to upgrade the Smart Water System, the government

583
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,810
specially invited Sanke Group

584
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:09,300
to be in charge of the overall planning and implementation of the bidding process.

585
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,940
The management of this company is relatively flat.

586
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:16,390
The bidding team is directly headed by President Cui Guo Rui.

587
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,130
The Purchase Department head is Tu Feng.

588
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:22,020
Technology Department Team Leader Xiao Xiao Yang will assist.

589
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:26,950
Bian Hai Tao, your marketing team has to provide

590
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:29,010
a winning pricing strategy for the sales team.

591
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,110
- Okay.
- All right, that's all for now.

592
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,790
Meeting adjourned.

593
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:36,660
Bian Hai Tao, we need to work very hard from now on.

594
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,420
You're right.

595
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,170
Since no one likes to have meetings in the conference room,

596
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:53,850
then let's meet in the break room instead.

597
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:59,970
Regarding the Sanke project,

598
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:02,070
let's take turns and speak your minds.

599
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,850
We're to speak?

600
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,990
Didn't I tell everyone yesterday to be prepared?

601
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:12,080
Alright, alright.

602
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:15,650
How about I say a few words first?

603
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:18,030
The technical issues of the Sanke project,

604
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:21,030
I think that will be the key point.

605
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:24,610
However, based on the "animal analysis method" Director Zhou taught us before,

606
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:27,230
- I would—
- What does everyone think sales is?

607
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:32,400
To sell things.

608
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:43,300
I'm different than Director Zhou.

609
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,940
I don't have a tech background, but what I want to tell you is

610
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:49,840
sales is a skill itself.
(TN: "Ji shu" can mean skill or technology)

611
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,860
You may say

612
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:56,000
that technology is the key for Sanke,

613
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,340
so it's the more I want to know

614
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:03,180
your thoughts on your pre-selling techniques.

615
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:09,990
Director Zhou used to be the one telling us what the clients want and their needs.

616
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:11,650
Then, we would create a plan.

617
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:15,860
He would tell us to make several plans according to the clients' needs.

618
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:18,560
Some times, it's a four-page plan; other times, it's a nine-page plan.

619
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,600
So we have references when we meet the clients.

620
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,120
Director Fang, could you tell us

621
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,130
what Sanke's needs are?

622
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,730
I'll repeat it once more

623
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:31,860
I'm different from Director Zhou.

624
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:36,390
So that's why I need you to help me analyze the client's needs.

625
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:39,170
And then make an overall evaluation plan.

626
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:42,210
The analysis can be detailed, or it can be a general one.

627
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:46,280
- Which one do you want?
- Before we have a business relationship with the clients,

628
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,320
our plan is the bargaining chip.

629
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:52,410
It's the stepping stone, whether it's detailed or general.

630
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:56,560
When Director Zhou was still here,

631
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,110
I've also seen a 50-page proposal.

632
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,400
Alright!

633
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,420
Since Director Zhou is not here right now,

634
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:06,060
I'll write the proposal according to what I think.

635
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:09,830
If we don't get the business, just don't blame it on us.

636
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:12,860
My name is Pei Guo Xia, not Scapegoat Xia, okay?

637
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:28,400
Director Fang.

00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,420
♫ The sun is only shining halfway  ♫

640
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:58,120
♫ The freckles on my face are bright and dark  ♫

641
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,730
♫ Oh... ♫

642
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,430
♫  Who sung the song halfway through  ♫

643
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:12,220
♫  Leaving behind the roars of the chorus in an empty room  ♫

644
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:15,310
♫  I...  ♫

645
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:22,170
♫  Slowly tidied up the embarrassment of the dispersing crowd  ♫

646
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:30,250
♫  Who would abruptly break off the lingering care of the past?  ♫

647
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,960
♫  You deserved it, someone said  ♫

648
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:44,320
♫  It would be for the best that the story stays unfinished  ♫

649
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:50,960
♫  Those words were spoken halfway  ♫

650
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,840
♫  When those few words reached the tip of the tongue  ♫

651
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:58,380
♫  It would take several years to accept  ♫

652
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:05,150
♫  Whose heart is closed midway from now on  ♫

653
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:12,560
♫  Locking up all the endless insomnia in the past?  ♫

654
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:19,170
♫  Some words are only spoken halfway  ♫

655
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:23,180
♫  To adjust the emotional intensity afterwards  ♫

656
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:26,600
♫  Just air-dry it slowly with time  ♫

657
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:33,290
♫  Whose heart will miss a half from now on  ♫

658
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:35,360
♫  Just let it totally submerge  ♫

659
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:41,780
♫  My remaining dimness  ♫

660
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:47,280
♫  The other half  ♫

661
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:54,040
♫  The other half  ♫

662
00:45:57,730 --> 00:46:01,470
♫  The other half  ♫
