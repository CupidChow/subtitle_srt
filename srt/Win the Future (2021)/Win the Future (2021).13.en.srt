[Episode 13]

22
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:09,330
I was initially planning to go back tonight,

23
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,130
but your parents are so enthusiastic

24
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,450
and insisted on my staying here for the night.

25
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,770
Isn't it because you're shameless?

26
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,920
When are you going back?

27
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,730
Did I say I'll be going back?

28
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,770
You must be a porcupine in the zodiac?

29
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:39,660
You're already sick like this, but you can still talk so aggressively.

30
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,470
Does it smell of garlic?

31
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,350
You've drank too much.

32
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,280
I just drank too much.

33
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,240
Good night!

34
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,180
Come, President Lin! Look at the camera.

35
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,840
Good! President Lin, change your pose.

36
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,320
Good.

37
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,010
Smile a little.

38
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,870
- Here, President Lin.
- Go away! It's so dark.

39
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,690
Miss...

40
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,830
- What's going on?
- We're so sorry, President Lin.

41
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:23,050
It's hot in here, so the Air Conditioner is turned up.

42
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,020
When we use more lights, it's easy to trip the circuit breaker.

43
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,590
- I've already sent someone to fix it.
- Okay, okay. Understood, understood.

44
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,950
Why don't we do an interview first at this time?

45
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,850
- Wait a moment.
- Okay.

46
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,640
I need to take this call.

47
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,780
Hello?

48
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,270
I'm by myself.

49
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,850
Yes. No one else.

50
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,620
Let me stress this to you again.

51
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,580
Luo Jia,

52
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,810
Director Luo isn't attending this interview.

53
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,900
Why isn't she coming? Don't ask me.

54
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,790
No more talking! If you're capable, find her for me.

55
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,780
Here! Have some water.

56
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,810
- Okay.
- Electricity is back. Electricity is back!

57
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,640
Okay then, didn't you want to do an interview? Come, come, come!

58
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,170
Come!

59
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,170
Thank you for your understanding. Here's what's going on!

60
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:31,820
- This issue of our magazine mainly wants to understand your—
- Sales.

61
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,150
If a company is controlled by sales,

62
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,660
it'll be doomed.

63
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,380
Do you know what sales is?

64
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,490
Let me tell you!

65
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,160
If you hate someone, tell him to go do sales.

66
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,270
It's because that's hell.

67
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:55,220
Physical exhaustion, distorted emotions, complete hair loss, and no one to depend on when you're old.

68
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,740
President Lin, you aren't referring to Director Luo, are you?

69
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,540
- Of course, not.
- She's exactly whom I'm talking about.

70
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,770
A sales genius?

71
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,330
She really thinks she's legendary?

72
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:10,690
It's all crafted by the company's money. Why is that?

73
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:14,900
Without her, won't Huikang survive?

74
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,110
She first did a dramatic turnover with me.

75
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,660
And now, she's playing some disappearing act.

76
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,540
Is she getting too accustomed to playing a female lead?

77
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,660
She discussed with herself to share the cake with the opponent.

78
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,130
The malfunction is the other side's problem, but she wants to bear the responsibility.

79
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,650
Who does she think she is?

80
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:39,270
The company's interest, the market share, sales indicators,

81
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,970
are all of these just numbers in her head?

82
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,970
The business world is like a battlefield.

83
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:49,080
Does she really think of herself as the Holy Mother?

84
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,340
Pre... President Lin, can we publish what you just said?

85
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,410
Publish it! Not a word less; publish everything.

86
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,820
Okay.

87
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,840
You should write elegantly to help us control the fire.

88
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,070
His temper was really bad just now.

89
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,080
Let me take a look when the draft is ready.

90
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,590
I think President Lin spoke well.

91
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,390
No need to douse the fire.

92
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,580
I'm suffocating.

93
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,170
- We've caused you trouble today.
- It's nothing.

94
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,680
Mr. Photographer, you worked hard.

95
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,430
Actually, what I wanted to say was the first half.

96
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:41,000
If you love someone, also let him do sales.

97
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,880
Its because that's heaven!

98
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,140
The world is big for you to be able to make fast money.

99
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,760
The entry threshold isn't high.

100
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,940
All you need is a mouth.

101
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,630
How did one Luo Jia turn you into this much of a mess?

102
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:08,120
She touched my lifeline.

103
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,670
First of all, you should be glad that this happened early.

104
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,120
You can still withstand this blow.

105
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,750
Besides, the acquisition hasn't started yet.

106
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,980
You aren't old, either.

107
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,410
I'm not young anymore.

108
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:31,980
When I think about having to start over on everything,

109
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,600
it's still quite scary.

110
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,420
What are you scared about?

111
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,980
Fame,

112
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,760
wealth,

113
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,800
image,

114
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,720
and worth.

115
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,830
They've all been turned upside down.

116
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:50,130
You can just turn them over again.

117
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,820
Don't treat this O&T case as a crisis.

118
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,830
Just be open to admit it and pay the compensation candidly.

119
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,890
As long as you have a sincere attitude,

120
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,910
along with my media publicity,

121
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,620
the result can be reversed.

122
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,170
No matter how much you hate Luo Jia,

123
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:10,390
you have to learn her style when it comes to handling things.

124
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,890
Her style is to run away.

125
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,770
Where can I run to?

126
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:21,860
Actually, the company can't do without Luo Jia.

127
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:26,680
The thing that she and Zhou Rui did, do you know how many companies

128
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,390
have come to me to add storage for data backup?

129
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,070
Moreover, it's all free.

130
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,990
Where do I have so much money?

131
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,890
I'm not that tolerant, either.

132
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,400
Let me talk about something off topic.

133
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,780
I suggest that you do some yoga.

134
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,030
I'm doing it.

135
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,650
You need to find a master.

136
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,860
Master will teach you.

137
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,090
A master?

138
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,210
Are there Yoga masters?

139
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,740
Gong Rui.

140
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,600
- Uncle.
- You can't sleep, either?

141
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,630
Then, let's go for a walk and have a chat.

142
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:35,010
Gong Rui, you must know what happened to Luo Jia, don't you?

143
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,940
Uncle, I can only guess.

144
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,790
If she won't say, she must have her own reasons.

145
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,270
True.

146
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,110
Have you been to Saihanba before?

147
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,970
No.

148
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,480
This virgin forest is so beautiful.

149
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,850
This isn't virgin forest.

150
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:58,350
This was planted one by one by a national corps.

151
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:02,100
Have you heard about the Paris Climate Agreement?

152
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,140
China wants to meet the

153
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,410
carbon quotas with those western countries.

154
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,950
Once the trees are planted,

155
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:12,030
each year, it can compensate for nineteen percent

156
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,960
of the carbon dioxide release quota.

157
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,590
However, they also say that planting trees

158
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:19,270
wastes a great amount of water resources.

159
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,960
Turning a bleak desert into an oasis

160
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,990
is originally to protect our water resources.

161
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:27,550
How couldn't they understand something so simple?

162
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:32,360
So, remember! The Chinese people don't need to look to anyone else.

163
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:37,410
It's because no matter what you do, people will still nit pick on you.

164
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,860
So, at any time,

165
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,280
one needs to work harder to become the one who sets up the rules.

166
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,500
How did I start talking to you about this?

167
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,290
Actually, even though Luo Jia didn't say anything, I also know what's happening.

168
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,880
She definitely came up against something she couldn't handle.

169
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,150
That's why she came home so suddenly.

170
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:58,530
The matter she can't handle could be because of me,

171
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,570
so I don't really know

172
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:03,720
if she wanted me to show up this time.

173
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,630
As a father, I know my daughter has been mistreated out there.

174
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,180
The more she says it's nothing,

175
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,420
the more anxious I become.

176
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,820
When you become a father, you'll understand.

177
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,220
- Hello?
- Director Zhou.

178
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,540
I'm admitting defeat.

179
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,390
Has your self-esteem been stepped all over?

180
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:54,000
Eleven yuan.

181
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,670
I consider myself dumb because I received only so few.

182
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,130
Whenever they heard me asking for a yuan,

183
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,210
there wasn't a single person who didn't yell at me.

184
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,330
It's so embarrassing.

185
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,240
How did you do it?

186
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,560
Just... I just need a yuan to buy some stuff or whatever.

187
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,530
Then why didn't you tell the truth?

188
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:14,000
Who would believe me if I told the truth?

189
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,160
Telling the truth and not being able to get the money aren't your mistake.

190
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,000
However, as a salesperson,

191
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,950
it's your fault if you can't get the money.

192
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:25,540
You can't even handle one yuan, who would feel assured

193
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,310
to let you handle countless numbers of orders?

194
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,680
- I understand.
- You don't understand.

195
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,130
This goal that I gave you, you need to—

196
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,140
You must be Fang Wei, aren't you?

197
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,890
Let me tell you what I know!

198
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:44,890
If you want to take a yuan from a client, it doesn't mean that there's no cost.

199
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,240
I'll give you an analogy.

200
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,920
For instance, a person who perspires profusely

201
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,780
will need a pack of tissues and a bottle of water.

202
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:54,450
Your Director Zhou wanted you to ask for one yuan, but he didn't say you couldn't trade for it.

203
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:57,610
If you take a pack of tissues and a bottle of water to exchange for money,

204
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:00,340
- do you get my meaning?
- Y-you said it so well!

205
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,060
Who... who are you?

206
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,700
I'm—

207
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,170
Fang Wei

208
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,870
the elders have a saying.

209
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:15,800
As a salesperson, you mustn't be afraid to make mistakes,

210
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,150
communicate well, be flexible, humble, and tolerant when encountering problems.

211
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,520
Remember this and reflect on it for yourself.

212
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,230
- I'm hanging up.
- Don't... Don't—

213
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,600
I brought you something to take away the sourness of the alcohol.

214
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,790
It felt like you were on the phone all day.

215
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,230
It seems so.

216
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:03,680
And here I was thinking if you didn't leave tomorrow,

217
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,280
I could take you fishing.

218
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:10,120
However, it seems like Jieke needs you more.

219
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,840
Tomorrow, if there's nothing else you can go back to the city.

220
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,280
I'm not going back.

221
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,930
[Fortune]

222
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,340
Then I'll go back.

223
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,340
What's going on?

224
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,650
The money isn't coming back.

225
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:02,140
Which room is President Lu in?

226
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,380
This shop of yours is really too cold.

227
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:11,090
I heard your shop provides foot reflexology as your anniversary promotion.

228
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:27,060
Why doesn't your shop provide drinks?

229
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:33,270
♫  Women's unique innocence  ♫

230
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,080
Director Lu,

231
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,300
please don't make it hard for me.

232
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,710
Why are you crying?

233
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:42,970
Did you enter the wrong room or did I make an appointment with the wrong person?

234
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,830
You aren't President Lu?

235
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:47,320
You're a lunatic!

236
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,600
No progress?

237
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,120
Ha ha!

238
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,530
What do you mean by "ha ha?"

239
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,680
Ha ha means ha ha.

240
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,040
Doesn't it feel good to swipe the card?

241
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,410
No?

242
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,690
Why do I suspect that you did some beauty treatments?

243
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,720
Are you able to think first before speaking?

244
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,250
Do you think everyone is like you?

245
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,180
No, wait! My father told me that

246
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,800
one should be a pest when chasing payments.

247
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,370
If you aren't shameless, you won't be able to recover the payment.

248
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:31,710
I think you're particularly suited to chase after payments.

249
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,160
Xie Yi, actually yesterday—

250
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,680
Actually, you just wanted to steal Director Lu from me!

251
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,480
Don't any of you even think about doing that!

252
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,230
- Give President Lu to me.
- I see you would do that.

253
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:50,390
Female bosses all love to have a young cheek to grab.

254
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,790
Then I should do it!

255
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,420
- Don't you have a mirror in your house or are you pretending to be clueless?
- Enough!

256
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,590
Go outside if you two want to quarrel.

257
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,680
If you're good at arguing, you might as well go out to retrieve the final payment.

258
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,480
I'll go—

259
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,080
Whom did I provoke?

260
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,980
I'll go.

261
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:27,540
[Director's Office]

262
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,060
Where's Director Wei?

263
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,930
Director Wei had a noon flight to Hangzhou.

264
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,400
Pay attention to your breathing.

265
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,430
Relax.

266
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,950
Both hands shoulders width apart.

267
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,710
Good! Stretch your legs and hold the position.

268
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:53,570
Your right hand stretches downward.

269
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:59,360
Your left hand reaches upward.

270
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,540
Look at your fingertips.

271
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:07,040
Great! Keep breathing.

272
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:12,540
President Lin, have you arrived?

273
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:16,080
Are you arriving soon? The board meeting is about to start.

274
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,800
Continue!

275
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,440
Jieke dodged the bullet this time around.

276
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,830
Our purchase price might have some changes.

277
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,460
We're planning right now to add sixty five million.

278
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,090
So I wanted to ask what you thought is.

279
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:31,110
Thirty million!

280
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,560
Sorry!

281
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:36,320
Master, you continue!

282
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,160
Jieke's performance in troubleshooting this

283
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,090
has gained a lot of points in the core technology.

284
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,500
Evaluation of the value of the company's brand

285
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,490
has improved significantly.

286
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:49,830
President Lin, you still should hurry back.

287
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,800
I won't add even a single yuan!

288
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,550
President Lin Jieke's estimated value has already increased a lot.

289
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:05,640
The acquisition price we wanted before, we really can't get it.

290
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,510
I already said very clear.

291
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:11,310
I'm purchasing at the lowest price.

292
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:14,060
I'll never allow Jieke to come back to life.

293
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,930
Can we try a different solution, then?

294
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:20,510
- We only purchase the core assets of Jieke, not the fixed assets.
- You...

295
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:24,120
I want all sorts of assets.

296
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,470
Jieke is already trapped in debt.

297
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,740
Now, we're even raising the price ourselves?

298
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,240
Are you all that rich?

299
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,240
When is Luo Jia coming back?

300
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,340
Why didn't you inherit your parents' enthusiasm at all?

301
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,280
It depends on who I'm with.

302
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:15,490
I was actually planning to leave last night.

303
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,240
However, because you said

304
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,830
that you wanted to fish so I stay;

305
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:23,440
so I changed my mind.

306
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:32,280
Can you really leave your phone off for that long?

307
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,660
I'm not as arrogant as you are.

308
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,680
The Earth won't stop turning without one person.

309
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:43,730
Those who don't have their phones on are arrogant.

310
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:51,110
Can you stop talking so loudly?

311
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,550
You'll scare all the fish away.

312
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,770
The water in the mountains are cold.

313
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:08,070
The fish are all in deep water and don't like to move.

314
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,240
They're sneaky like that.

315
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,070
They only grab a quick bite when they see food.

316
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,260
Isn't that the same as clients?

317
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,990
If your solution isn't precise enough,

318
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:23,620
or if there's no profit to be gained, they don't even move.

319
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:27,530
Otherwise, they welcome you with smiling faces.

320
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:30,710
Are you still the same Zhou Rui whom I know?

321
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:36,080
Don't you set the standard for what the fish eats, how it eats, and how much it eats?

322
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,240
It turns out you think that I'm that incredible?

323
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,190
However, Jieke, our small boat,

324
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:46,140
didn't it almost tip over when it faced you, Luo Jia of the North?

325
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:51,540
I was busy removing all the harm and left you guys out.

326
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:54,760
I'll regret all my life for helping you out.

327
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,760
I hate myself for that.

328
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,790
How long is one's life?

329
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,180
You don't know, do you?

330
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:07,490
I'll tell you! It's exactly your whole lifetime.

331
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,580
Are you mad?

332
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,410
Come over here!

333
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,590
Do you admit you were wrong?

334
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,740
I do!

335
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,360
- Are you still yelling?
- No. I won't.

336
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,230
I won't yell anymore. I won't yell. No more yelling.

337
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:39,150
Let me sing you a song!

338
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,770
Shut up!

339
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:45,930
♪  This is my home  ♪

340
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,640
All right, I lose!

341
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,580
Jia Jia. Jia Jia!

342
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,810
- Jia Jia!
- What?

343
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,430
Why is your phone off?

344
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:03,740
Your work can't find you, so they called me!

345
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,410
Hurry up!

346
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,540
Hello? It's me!

347
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,410
Hello, Master?

348
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,460
Okay, I got it.

349
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,210
I'll be back right away.

350
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,310
I'll come back to the office immediately.

351
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:31,240
Something happened with Yang Lu.

352
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,430
Wang Yi Nan joined Huikang.

353
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,100
Hi, Yang Lu! Where are you?

354
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,520
Wait for me then!

355
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,920
What happened to Yang Lu?

356
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:20,940
If two people in a relationship work in the same business, can they give each other some space?

357
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,440
Wait! Who's in a relationship with you?

358
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,880
Doesn't this count as dating?

359
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,070
It doesn't count for me.

360
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,940
Then when does it count?

361
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,880
It counts when it counts.

362
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,790
It already counts for me.

363
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,650
- It doesn't for me.
- It does for me.

364
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:44,700
"Give each other space".

365
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,790
[Driving Mode]
[Comfort Mode] - [Sport Mode] - [Anti-skid Mode]

366
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,940
Do you want me to close the window?

367
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,590
No.

368
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:10,220
If you regret it, we can still turn around and go back.

369
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,910
Sure! Let's go back.

370
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:15,060
What about you then?

371
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:18,860
Then I'll send you back to Saihanba and come back.

372
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:29,250
Right now, I still don't know whether it's right or wrong to go back to Beijing.

373
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:32,900
Either way, you aren't the same you anymore.

374
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,290
- Why?
- It's because you have me now.

375
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,610
What happened?

376
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:56,430
Master.

377
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,810
You're back?

378
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:01,250
How are things in Hangzhou?

379
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,900
I pretty much figured it out.

380
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,830
Yang Lu has been withholding the orders of a few major clients without progressing,

381
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:08,270
so the business in East China has dropped sharply.

382
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,750
Is something wrong with the orders?

383
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,600
They said the details of the contracts haven't been finalized so they needed to wait.

384
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,780
However, I looked at the contracts, nothing's major.

385
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:19,600
What's the total amount for those orders?

386
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,700
Over one hundred million.

387
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,330
What do you plan to do?

388
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:27,850
This has severe consequences and needed to be handled seriously.

389
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:31,090
I intend to ask Yang Lu to come to Beijing to give the leadership team an explanation personally.

390
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:34,050
- And then?
- Yang Lu must leave.

391
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,790
Let's wait until Zhou Rui is back to decide.

392
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:39,560
The signs of human manipulation are obvious, I don't see the need to delay any further.

393
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,450
Tell me the truth!

394
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:57,890
Aren't you loving what's happening to Yang Lu?

395
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:00,590
- I didn't ask her to withhold the orders.
- But you've always wanted to sell the company.

396
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,380
There's nothing wrong with selling.

397
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,620
It'll be better than this.

398
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:09,160
If you still think that way now,

399
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,280
there's no point for you to stay here.

400
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,090
Master,

401
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:30,680
you've been holding these words back for a long time, haven't you?

402
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,020
You've disliked me for a while now.

403
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,560
However, it's a shame,

404
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,870
it's because you can't fire me.

405
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:44,510
The orders within the banking system in my hands take up sixty persent of the revenue in Northern China.

406
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,900
Are you threatening me?

407
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,870
You're the one who's forcing me.

408
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:54,070
The major clients from the bank deliver billions every year.

409
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:56,050
I've worked with those clients for over a decade.

410
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:59,910
They'll follow me, not the company.

411
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:16,780
President Chen, President Lin from Huikang wants to see you.

412
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:19,410
I got it.

413
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,680
Did you schedule it?

414
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,330
I did.

415
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:30,120
You'll cancel it.

416
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:47,440
Xie Yi. Xie Yi!

417
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,980
Don't keep avoiding me!

418
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,780
Here! You like this milk tea.

419
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,360
Sorry! I quit milk tea already.

420
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,420
Xie Yi!

421
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,540
Give me an opportunity to explain. I really do—

422
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,340
Thanks.

423
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,050
- Thank you
- You're welcome.

424
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:09,760
Fang Wei.

425
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,270
Don't you want that order with President Lu?

426
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,970
You got it!

427
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,040
She didn't back down after two rounds with you guys?

428
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,890
I've got to try a different approach.

429
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,660
I want to see what your approach is.

430
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:28,030
I'll stand on my toes and reach it.

431
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,840
Do you play games?

432
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,480
You were playing defense, but you have to attack.

433
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,110
Aren't you asking to get yourself killed?

434
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,820
Xie Yi,

435
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,770
why didn't you give the order with President Lu to Cui Long?

436
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:45,620
Do you think he can actually do sales?

437
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,610
Baby,

438
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,880
Mom did something wrong to you.

439
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,410
Holy crap!

440
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:58,120
Check your email, everyone! Yang Lu from East China is screwed.

441
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,760
She's suspended immediately and under investigation.

Are you going to turn on your phone first or kiss me first?

00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:46,060
Neither.

448

I'm really leaving.

Don't forget! Tell me when you've thought it through.

Get some people to pick up the mountain of goods that I got for everyone from my car.

455
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:34,470
Okay. Thanks, Director Luo!

- Give me that beef jerky.
- I want that.

- You're really here.
- Yes, I am.

475
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,020
Please help and look after me from now on.

476
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:38,170
You used to be the top salesperson in Jieke's Eastern China region.

477
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:41,180
I hope your joining us will bring revenue to Huikang,

instead of trouble.

It appears that you really needed a vacation.

Have you rested enough?

484
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,380
You can keep resting.

485

487
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:46,490
Oh yes! The compensation for O&T

488
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:49,180
has been sent over in full.

489
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,960
It isn't a big amount.

490
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:55,680
However, you know what the company's rules are.

491
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:58,320
Rewards and penalties clearly just.

492
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,020
It's also a good explanation for the Board of Directors.

493
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,280
The others in the sales department shouldn't get deducted.

494
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,470
If you're going to deduct anything, just take it from me.

495
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,080
Deduct more!

496
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,070
I knew this is what you'd say.

497
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,120
I saw Wang Yi Nan just now.

498
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,810
Have you done a background check on him?

499
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:23,160
He said he chatted with you, and that you know him well.

500
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,630
It isn't important whether I know him or not.

501
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:28,440
However, his welcome gift is very important.

502
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:32,270
It's very meaningful to you and to the company.

503
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:36,940
Sure! You can get back to work then.

504
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:13,510
Yang Lu.

505
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:16,290
Bring me my towel!

506
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,570
Towel? Towel?

507
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:32,780
Goddess.

508
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:35,080
No, no, no! Don't dirty up my clothes.

509
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:39,270
Smell your towel! It smells so bad.

510
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:41,900
You live like a pig.

511
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,560
Goddess,

512
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,960
let's hug!

513
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,270
Hug!

514
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:52,960
When I entered the room, the entire room smelled of you.

515
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,470
Only when I smell that fragrant, do I know I'm home.

516
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:59,740
Grandma!

517
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:03,770
Let me see!

518
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:07,420
Skinnier or fatter?

519
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,560
You've lost weight.

520
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:18,520
Boss, you're back!

521
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,890
Tell me! Why did you do it?

522
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:43,450
The contract's service clause hasn't changed, but the client's demands keep changing.

523
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:47,190
- I thought if I took too much initiative—
- I said, tell me the truth!

524
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:52,240
Ungrateful Child, speak nicely!

525
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:56,330
Grandma!

526
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:59,180
Yang Lu brought me here from a long ways away.

527
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,010
Why haven't you even said a thank to her?

528
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,970
Grandma, you're tired now.

529
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:05,390
Don't bother tidying up! Rest for a while.

530
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:08,380
Yang Lu and I are talking serious business.

531
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,040
Speak!

532
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,460
Your Beijing unit's performance has been at the bottom.

533
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,890
I didn't want you to be lower than everyone.

534
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:36,160
Because of this, you've held back Eastern China's orders and not signed them?

535
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,160
Eastern China has always been one of the top performers.

536
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,210
It's fine if it skips a month.

537
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:41,870
It's fine?

538
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:44,190
It's fine?

539
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:47,460
Do think they're all idiots?

540
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:50,480
They can't see that you're helping me?

541
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,980
Can you really help me with this difficult situation?!

542
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:56,980
Ultimately, you're taking the company's gains,

543
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:01,620
the colleagues in Eastern China's wealth and their gains as a joke.

544
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,110
What are you crying for?

545
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:09,930
- You know why I did this.
- There's no justification for it.

546
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:12,040
The company handed you the Eastern China Region.

547
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,080
What is sales? What are the principles of sales?

548
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,190
- You represent me!
- Ungrateful Child!

549
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:20,680
What's going on? This water is cold one minute and hot the next.

550
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:24,880
This... This... What kind of place is this?

551
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:29,500
Tomorrow... There's a meeting tomorrow.

552
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,640
What will you do?

553
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,500
Don't worry about it! I know what to do.

554
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,290
I'll handle it.

555
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:41,080
Yang Lu!

556
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:46,590
I don't care what method you use,

557
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:49,520
don't make a mistake upon another mistake.

558
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,960
Got it!

559
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:56,090
Grandma, I'll help you.

560
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,910

♫  Leaving behind the roars of the chorus in an empty room  ♫

♫  Who would abruptly break off the lingering care of the past?  ♫

♫  You deserved it, someone said  ♫
