I have to have strength. Must have strength!

You're another step closer to being without financial obligations.

The company has indeed made profit through the O&T project.

107
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:34,030
However, it's truly also given Jieke some space to breathe.

This amount of profit,

109
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:41,280
won't have an effect on Jieke's current value.

- After?
- Then once Zhou Rui joins us,

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,220
Sugarcane isn't sweet on both ends.
(TN: No one can advance on both sides)

164
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,310
Everything should have a definite decision.

165
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:28,960
Look at the O&T project! See what you've done.

166
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,940
- That was my negligence.
- Enough!

167
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,920
Let bygones be bygones.

168
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,260
Quickly set up a meeting for me to meet with President Chen.

169
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,040
I'll do my best.

170
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,320
If you want to mend your mistake,

171
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,190
you can't just try your best, you must do it.

172
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,590
Unless you regret it now.

173
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:02,330
- President Lin—
- I hope you won't regret it.

174
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,280
Boss, I'm going to say something that you won't like to hear.

175
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,640
If Grandmother didn't have an accident this time, you wouldn't have come back, would you?

176
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,140
You know I don't like to hear it, but you still said it?

177
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,480
You'll still have a lot to worry about after this.

178
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,330
I didn't expect so many changes from this trip to Beijing.

179
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,480
Director Wei has his own management habits.

180
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,970
Tell everyone to learn how to adapt.

181
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,830
No problem! I can do it.

182
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:40,110
You sound more and more like Grandma.

183
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,690
Really?

184
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,840
Frankly, about the trouble Wang Yi Nan got into last time,

185
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,960
you said one sentence, "the client is the most important."

186
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,340
You know Xutong's President Shang. He's a smiling tiger.

187
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,150
On the surface, everything looks good, but he'll make it hard for you everywhere.

188
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,270
Everyone can only tough it out and take care of the aftermath.

189
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,110
That Wei Yan doesn't help, either.

190
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:01,140
He can't wait for us to pay our own money into it.

191
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:05,010
You need to learn how to encourage everyone.

192
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:09,810
Tell everyone! The work for the client definitely won't be in vain.

193
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,680
Actually, I met with President Shang by myself early this morning.

194
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,100
He has a new cellphone payment functionality.

195
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,760
He'll sign the project with you.

196
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,080
He actually understands.

197
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,650
You know that I'm not only talking about just this one project, don't you?

198
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:25,410
When you aren't in the eastern region, not to mention that the team is difficult to lead,

199
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:28,440
but the others also know that you're stuck in the northern region

200
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,370
and have already started to look for other collaboration partners.

201
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,040
Then...

202
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,380
why don't I cancel the flight and stay here?

203
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,650
I know it's tougher for you in Beijing.

204
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,880
Let's stop talking about this. Get in the car!

205
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,370
Actually, everything else is okay.

206
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,840
Deal with Wei Yan, he takes everything to heart.

207
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,890
No one knows exactly what he's thinking.

208
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,280
Once I stand up from northern region's muddy mire, and when I can stand steady,

209
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,470
I'll come back to accompany you in taking back the territory.

210
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,350
You've got all the banking clients.

211
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:06,720
It's better not to let the banks know yet about the company's funding problem.

212
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,510
Otherwise, there will be variables in the negotiation.

213
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,900
The problem with the funding chain is already known throughout the city.

214
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,630
That's the reason why you should cooperate more with Zhou Rui.

215
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:16,790
Right now, he's the only one who can be counted on to make a profit.

216
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,000
Understood, President Chen.

217
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:25,280
I ran into President Lin, Lin Zhen Wei, at the Broad View Forum.

218
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,350
- Huikang's Lin Zhen Wei?
- Yes.

219
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,770
He wants to meet with you.

220
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,620
Meet with me?

221
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,820
Sugarcane isn't sweet on both ends.

222
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,150
Everything should have a definite decision.

223
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:43,860
What do you think he wants to talk to me about?

224
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,950
After all, we're both winners in the O&T deal.

225
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:50,110
maybe he wants to show some goodwill?

226
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,750
Goodwill?

227
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,500
What good is there?

228
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:02,140
There are a lot of rumors outside about our two companies.

229
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,140
They say Huikang wants to buy us,

230
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,370
and also that the board of directors on both sides have an estimated value.

231
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:08,320
I think...

232
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,750
it isn't enough to let the wise stop the rumors.

233
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,030
We still need facts to stop the rumors.

234
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,210
Then let me tell you about the rumors that I've heard.

235
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:21,260
Some people are saying that you deliberately flipped orders

236
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,110
and wasn't really taking a vacation.

237
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:27,310
You even secretly exchanged messages with other companies.

238
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:34,090
I hope that you won't regret it.

239
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:36,440
I don't believe any of it.

240
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,720
There are no alleged facts.

241
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,690
Since there are no facts,

242
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:44,350
where did the rumors come from then?

243
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,340
I only look at performance,

244
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,960
at who brings profit to the company.

245
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,040
It's that simple.

246
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:05,910
Why did he have you bring me this message?

247
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:10,990
I only ran into him at the Broad View Forum by accident.

248
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:37,850
About what happened last night, I'm really, really sorry.

249
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:47,000
About what happened last night, I'm really, really sorry.

250
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,730
It looks like that you're really back in Hangzhou.

251
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,500
In your mind, am I really a liar?

252
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,550
If you were a liar, I wouldn't be here.

253
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,610
What is it?

254
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,560
The previous two times when the company said to hire you,

255
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,450
it was always at an unofficial occasion.

256
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:17,400
When Liu Bei asked for Zhuge Liang's help, he went to visit the thatched hut three times.
 (TN: a famous legend from Three Kingdoms era)

257
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,890
This is also the third time for me.

258
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,720
Not going to take a look? The offer should be something you have no reason to refuse.

259
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,700
I don't care about that.

260
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,060
Why are you just like the Fast Company's President Cao?

261
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,990
Could you be any weaker?

262
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:43,270
Wasn't he quite cute yesterday?

263
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:46,230
- Of course, he has to repay what he owes me.
- Enough!

264
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:48,980
After talking about what's far away, come back to reality.

265
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,290
I recommend that you still take a look.

266
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,290
[Offer Letter]

267
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,280
[Annual Salary is ____ yuan]

268
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,310
Letting me name the price?

269
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:20,910
You can think of it as sincerity towards you.

270
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:24,190
If it were you, would you accept it?

271
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,270
Of course, I wouldn't accept it.

272
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:31,690
If you really come, will you be reporting to me, or will I report to you?

273
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,450
I get it now.

274
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,320
This is President Lin's idea.

275
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,680
The previous two times were my idea.

276
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,590
This time, you can rest easy.

277
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,850
Where are all of your employees?

278
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,800
Physical exams.

279
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:59,380
I want to see the place where you locked me up last time.

280
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,970
Why? What for?

281
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:07,450
Nothing much! I just always think back to that place.

282
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,560
What? You won't let me see it? Forget it if you won't.

283
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,410
Okay, you want to revisit an old familiar place.

284
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,970
I'll take you there.

285
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,450
Please!

286
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,990
If you hadn't locked me in there that day,

287
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:34,500
President Du would've agreed to let you extend the test time still, wouldn't he?

288
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:38,610
That day really messed me up.

289
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:40,500
The more I think about it,

290
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:45,410
your relationship with Du Heng is even stronger.

291
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,170
What do you mean by even stronger?

292
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:51,640
I actually think you two admire each other.

293
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,060
Why are you so sensitive?

294
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:09,950
Every since I met you, I've ruined two pairs of high heels.

295
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,910
- Come and take a look!
- Look at what?

296
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,650
See how I wrecked the door.

297
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:20,850
Do I really have to look?

298
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:26,050
So many holes! You really didn't hold back.

299
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:28,450
If you were hitting me instead, then wouldn't—

300
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,990
Luo Jia, you're really bent on taking revenge, aren't you?

301
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:39,180
Yes, that's right.

302
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:43,360
There's no end to revenge, is there?

303
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,610
I don't care whether there's an end or not.

304
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:53,100
Luo Jia, haven't I already apologized?

305
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,880
Even if you want revenge, go about it more maturely.

306
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,390
Don't act so childish!

307
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:59,150
I still have to go to Fast Company in a while.

308
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:01,410
After that, I have to go to O&T's server room.

309
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:04,390
Open the door! You're supposed to go with me.

310
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:07,010
Just stay here and relax.

311
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,560
I'm not trying to exact revenge on you.

312
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,950
I just want you to take some time to reflect on what you've done.

313
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:14,830
I bet you'll no longer be angry in ten minutes.

314
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,190
Twenty minutes? I'll be waiting.

315
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,970
Luo Jia!

316
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:31,980
Luo Jia, stop joking!

317
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,410
Luo Jia!

318
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:38,050
I really have things I need to do.

319
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,380
I'm going to be angry!

320
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:47,700
Is anybody out there?

321
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,370
Hello President Chen! President Lin is here already.

322
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:09,870
Alright.

323
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:12,540
Wait for me out here!

324
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,230
What are you doing?

325
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,150
If you want to talk, then talk, why do you fight?

326
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,980
Stop!

327
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,570
Come on!

328
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,730
Take action now!
- Stop fighting!

329
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,270
What would you like to drink?

330
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,940
President Chen.

331
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,070
Look! Take a look.

332
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:35,820
The warehouse fighting incident of Jieke and Fast has become viral.

333
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,870
Want to fight, don't you?

334
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:37,930
You think we can't fight back, either?

335
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:40,940
There's always fighting involved when one's trying to build an empire.

336
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,880
It's normal for young people to fight.

337
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,780
That's in the past.

338
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:50,830
Negative news like this is going to seriously damage the valuation of Jieke Co.

339
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:54,290
Isn't that what you want?

340
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:01,530
As far as the valuation you're talking about goes,

341
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:05,190
Jieke doesn't need outsiders to determine how much money it's worth.

342
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,310
I heard...

343
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,700
that there might be a change as to how long you'll serve as president.

344
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,590
The Board of Directors only gave you less than a year,

345
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,390
so I can wait.

346
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:21,010
If you could really wait, then you wouldn't be asking to see me now.

347
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:25,030
- Get to the point then!
- I want to acquire Jieke Co.

348
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:27,360
That won't be possible unless they change their CEO.

349
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,210
President Chen,

350
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,940
this is unlike you.

351
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,590
Jieke Co. cannot be taken over by someone with the last name of Lin.

352
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:39,260
What does a last name matter when we're dealing with money?

353
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:43,470
A couple of days ago I went to the hospital for a cervical spine examination.

354
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:47,380
The doctor told me I shouldn't bow my head for the rest of my life.

355
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:06,620
President Lin, I suggest you give up acquiring Jieke Technology while President Chen is still serving in his position.

356
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,420
It isn' easy to get to see you.

357
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:17,130
While I see you everywhere on the internet.

358
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:23,040
What do you want to drink? As long as you can name it,

359
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,010
it's all here.

360
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,920
Let's add each other on WeChat.

361
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:34,950
We can contact each other directly without involving others in the future.

362
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,090
Sure! Let me scan yours.

363
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,360
Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!

364
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,140
Yeah!

365
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:28,080
Yeah!

366
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,700
President Lin. President Lin's serve.

367
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,770
- Awesome, Brother-in-law! You're so cool!
- Stop taking photos.

368
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:40,430
Alright, alright. No more photos, no more photos.

369
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:43,020
- Xi Xi.
- Yes, President Lin.

370
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,190
- See them out.
- Okay.

371
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,770
Press people, please follow me. Thank you for coming.

372
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:48,910
Thank you, Coach.

373
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:51,500
- I'm done for the day.
- Okay.

374
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:55,320
So cool! Look at those poses.

375
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:59,820
Just like a professional!

376
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,970
What's wrong, Brother-in-law?

377
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:06,340
Huikang's equipment... Speak!

378
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,270
How much did you sell them for?

379
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:12,100
I'll tell you! I sold them for twenty million dollars.

380
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:15,690
Tell me! Did you use that money to fund your own business?

381
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,700
You're creative now, aren't you?

382
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,910
I lost a lot in financial investments, I need money!

383
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:21,670
But don't worry, Brother-in-law!

384
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:24,240
Give me three months, I'll promise I'll pay you back.

385
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,330
Listen to me! My recent business ventures have a lot of potential.

386
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,740
I just lack a bit of capital.

387
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,910
Don't worry! It's no problem.

388
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:32,580
I'll definitely have the money to pay you back. Don't you worry!

389
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,390
Did you need money?

390
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:36,520
Selling other people's equipment if you lack money?

391
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,380
- Don't hit me!
- How could you sell Huikang's equipment?

392
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,460
- I—
- You're ruining me!

393
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:46,690
Wouldn't I go to jail if I sold other people's stuff?

394
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:48,330
Did you even know you could go to jail?

395
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:51,550
I want to see you rot in jail!

396
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,720
Take this!

397
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,620
Are you done yet?

398
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,410
Fine!

399
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:00,870
If I go to jail, we both should go together.

400
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:05,980
In a phone conversation, you told me to get Jieke's equipment for Huikang.

401
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,570
You said you'd take care of any problems.

402
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:09,260
Have you forgotten it already?

403
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:12,380
I recorded the call, and I made copies, too.

404
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,280
What are you going to do about it?

405
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,210
- I can beat you to death right now. Believe me?
- I d-d-do.

406
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:19,310
Brother in law! I absolutely believe you.

407
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:22,070
Let go of me, let go of me!

408
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:26,060
Do you think I'm a money printing machine?

409
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:29,600
Listen! This twenty million dollar debt of yours,

410
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,520
I'll find a way to take care of it for you.

411
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,400
But remember! This is the last time.

412
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,570
Don't cause me any more trouble!

413
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:42,440
I swear this is definitely the last time.

414
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:45,000
Give me your phone!

415
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,060
You were so cool just now.

416
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,340
I got it all on video. Look!

417
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:53,220
I'll keep this for now.

418
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,480
- You need to disappear for the time being.
- I understand, Brother-in-law.

419
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,190
Hurry on and leave!

420
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,760
Brother-in-law, without my cell phone,

421
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,540
how will I receive your instructions?

422
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:13,070
Get lost!

423
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,850
How can this be?

424
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,100
I'll go to find President Cao.

425
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,440
Quickly call Director Zhou, okay?

426
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:06,750
Director Zhou, why are you here?

427
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,560
Someone's finally here.

428
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,610
Where did you all go?

429
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:15,660
No wait... Weren't for the physical exams?

430
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:20,890
W-Who would've known that you were locked up here?

431
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,530
Director Luo, you're finally back.

432
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:54,060
Where did you go?

433
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:56,150
I don't want to talk about it.

434
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:58,260
What was the emergency that you called me about?

435
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:02,770
I heard the Sales staff mentioning that they lost contact with the boss of Fast.

436
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:05,610
Old Cao?

437
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:15,850
This really wasn't the time to get revenge.

438
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:22,040
- Director Luo, should we report the Fast company to the police?
- What police report?

439
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,650
Is there a fire or did someone die?

440
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,550
It's the Sales Department's job to get our client to payout.

441
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:27,790
Just because they're late on their payments, you want to cause them trouble?

442
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:30,680
Do you think everything can be solved if you called the police?

443
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:35,270
If this gets out, who would be willing to work with our company anymore?

444
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:38,840
Let me ask you! Is this your first day in the Sales Department?

445
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:41,960
Get out!

446
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:59,710
Master, there's a problem with the Fast project.

447
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,670
There are only two types of problems when it involves clients.

448
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:03,890
Either discuss it or renege on the payment.

449
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:07,000
I believe Director Zhou should be referring to the second type.

450
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,900
Reneged on the debt, the person's run off, too.

451
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:13,740
Don't tell me that you've never experienced this before after working so many years in sales?

452
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,580
Director Wei, this is known as "forewarning."

453
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:18,010
Why didn't you tell me this before you gave me the project?

454
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:20,400
Look at this first!

455
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,030
[Huikang Company]
[Acquisition Proposal]

456
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:32,140
- That fast?
- Master, what does this mean?

457
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:35,200
Chairman Li Zi Cheng gave this to me.

458
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:38,720
A contract signed under coercion was going to happen sooner or later.

459
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:43,420
Do you two want to flee

460
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,410
or continue to resist?

461
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:48,780
The company's profit this month covered the shortfall from Fast entirely.

462
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:52,270
We need supplies to resist during the war.

463
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:55,390
So, are you both shirking your responsibilities?

464
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:59,120
Either it's money or it's pieces of equipment

465
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,680
you have to have one of them, don't you?

466
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,390
This is basic responsibility.

467
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,580
You all have to take it.

468
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:34,540
- President Lin.
- Has Zhou Rui come back with the offer letter?

469
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,660
I was just about to discuss this with you.

470
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:40,720
You were kind with your invitation, but someone didn't appreciate it.

471
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,950
- He rejected it?
- Yes.

472
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:49,740
Did he reject it or did you get him to reject it?

473
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,830
That isn't important.

474
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:54,190
All that matters is that he rejected it.

475
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:58,230
What would you like to drink?

476
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,330
No need! But thanks.

477
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,610
There's something else.
