22
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,100
Who grills meat like this?

23
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,920
I'm hungry! If you grill it one at a time, how long will it take before it's ready?

24
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,210
- Even if you're hungry, you still need to wait until everyone gets here.
- Everyone?

25
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,170
Ye Chao Dong skipped out because he doesn't drink.

26
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,950
You aren't on good terms with Xiao Yun.

27
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,380
Old Lei said that he was busy and would be here later.

28
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,400
Fang Wei is probably scared that he would've to pay the bill.

29
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,410
He joined the team after I resigned.

30
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,840
The new replaces the old. How meaningless!

31
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,060
That rhymes pretty well.

32
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,840
Give Fang Wei a call and ask him where he is.

33
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,560
What's the rush?

34
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,750
You should appreciate our time together.

35
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,170
If you really resign, then we won't be able to see each other even if we want to.

36
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,220
Are you that eager to see me leave?

37
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,600
I'm afraid that you'll regret it.

38
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,910
How much did you drink to be like this?

39
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,500
How much did she drink?

40
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,820
Come! Let me show you guys something.

41
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:06,650
Have the Marketing, Sales, and Public Relations departments come up with a layoff plan as soon as possible.

42
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:11,100
Regarding the redundant staff, our Sales department already has a preliminary layoff plan.

43
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,440
Then I have to say this.

44
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,100
As long as Jieke is still operating,

45
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:22,430
not a single employee in the Sales department can be laid off.

46
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:25,640
Director Zhou, you should clearly know that

47
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,560
what determines if a business thrives or dies, isn't skill or talent, but cash flow.

48
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,240
How much will be saved by laying off a few sales department employees?

49
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,680
How much?

50
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:41,960
I, Zhou Rui, will give my annual income and bonus this year to take care of these people.

51
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,200
I only have one request.

52
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,300
Not one person in the sales department can be cut.

53
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,010
Xie Yi!

54
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:58,160
Come, come! You handed in your resignation for nothing.

55
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,760
It's for nothing!

56
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,670
Right now, you still have a chance to change your mind.

57
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,030
I don't regret it.

58
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,380
I'll never regret it.

59
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,920
I won't hide it from you guys.

60
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,500
I also handed in my resignation letter.

61
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,230
Old Lei, no...

62
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,860
Why did you do that?

63
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,540
To be honest,

64
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:24,330
I never thought I'd last in Sales into the Twenty-First Century.

65
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,830
I've never been a great salesperson.

66
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,610
I can't compare to Chao Dong's sales performance.

67
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:33,430
I'm not as young as Xie Yi.

68
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,070
I'm not as capable as Fang Wei, either.

69
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:40,130
Young Long, don't look at me! I wasn't going to compare myself to you.

70
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,790
In addition, my proposals aren't as good as Xiao Yun's.

71
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:47,920
I'm only still here today because President Chen and I are old friends.

72
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,550
To put it bluntly,

73
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:53,500
the waves wash away the sand, just as times've changed.

74
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,250
I can't do it anymore; I really can't keep up.

75
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:01,190
- You don't have to feel sorry for me.
- This cup of wine is to toast you, Old Lei. Cheers!

76
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,890
- Thanks!
- Old Lei.

77
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:05,750
- It's a toast to Director Zhou, too.
- All right.

78
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,130
I...

79
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,600
have a toast to myself.

80
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,930
Stop acting up!

81
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,010
Take it easy. Easy!

82
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,190
Don't say anything!

83
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,460
Don't say anything!

84
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,820
What are you doing here?

85
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,870
Do you have amnesia?

86
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:42,120
I had a very long dream.

87
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,500
Me, too! I dreamt of you.

88
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,550
Can you not be so vulgar?

89
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,530
I'm being serious.

90
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:57,160
I dreamt that we were bidding in the O&T negotiation room.

91
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,910
We took turns bidding and drove the price lower and lower.

92
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:04,380
From tens of millions to just a few million. Then—

93
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,350
Help me call the nurse.

94
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:12,240
It isn't empty yet, why should we call the nurse?

95
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,040
- I told you to call the nurse, then just call.
- Tell me what you need.

96
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,270
I can help you.

97
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,620
I want to go to the bathroom.

98
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,970
I... I...

99
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,250
I'll go with you.

100
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,530
Let's go!

101
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,870
In a minute! I'm dizzy.

102
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,790
Lend me a hand!

103
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,640
What are you doing here?

104
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,970
Didn't you tell me to come?

105
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:56,520
When did I tell you to come?

106
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,820
You told Xiao Le that you were in Saihanba.

107
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,230
Isn't that you trying to tell me indirectly?

108
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:05,650
Then you posted a photo with the IV drip, isn't that got your location?

109
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,960
I told Xiao Long that I was in Saihanba

110
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,320
because I was worried the company might need me for something.

111
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,900
I sent her a photo because I really thought that I was going to die last night.

112
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,970
Really? You felt that you were dying yesterday.

113
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,180
Then what are you doing here?

114
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,020
I'm going home.

- We're here.
- Ma'am.

116
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:29,710
- Is there anywhere to hang the IV drip in there?
- No.

117
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:34,040
Go ahead! I'll hold it for you outside of the door.

118
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,790
Go on!

119
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,380
- Don't get too close to me.
- I can't hear you!

120
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,360
I hear nothing.

121
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,360
- Don't get too close.
- Okay. I got it.

Are there shared portable power bank chargers here?

- What did you say?
- Shared portable bank chargers.

No.

Hello!

00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,760
Did you want to borrow my charger just then?

- Yes, yes, yes.
- This is mine; I'll let you borrow it.

I already powered off my phone, so I don't need to charge.

145
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,470
I'll charge it then.

Take it.

President Chen is going crazy looking for you.

Director Wei called everyone into a meeting.

I don't know why, but he didn't ask for me.

156

Then you can just look for clients by yourself.

00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,740
Go to a square where there are a lot of people.

162
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,410
Ask for ¥1 from everyone.

163
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,680
Once you've gathered ¥100,

164
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,370
it'll be mission accomplished.

165
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:44,280
However, I'll remind you! No matter what method you use, it cannot be illegal.

166
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,160
Then wouldn't I be a beggar?

167
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,690
You've only one chance to ask for help.

168
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:53,020
No need! Wouldn't that be just ¥100?

169
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,490
I'll definitely complete the mission and surpass the quota.

170
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,530
I'm watching you boast.

Zhou Rui.

172
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,440
Director Zhou.

173
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:08,960
what exactly are you doing?

174
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,020
Can you reveal a little?

175
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,360
What do you want to know?

176
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,730
You suddenly got out of touch.

177
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:17,490
- Everyone feels lost.
- Zhou Rui, I want to go back.

178
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,320
I'm afraid Director Wei will take advantage, you know?

179
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,320
- Okay. I'm hanging up.
- Don't force me to search for you!

180
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,000
- You know my skills.
- You dare?

181
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,220
Come on! I have another call.

182
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,050
Hello, President Li! President Li.

183
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:33,890
My cellphone? My cellphone's battery was out.

184
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,240
I've already given your account to Wei Yan.

185
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,200
His salesperson will contact you.

186
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,160
I'm keeping an eye on it for you. Don't worry!

187
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,280
Hello, President Huang!

188
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:51,080
Of course, we'll take care of your company's matter.

189
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,810
I'll let you know when it's done.

190
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,390
I'll contact you when I get back.

191
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:57,580
Yes, yes, yes. It's because my cellphone was out... out... of battery.

192
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,730
No power left.

193
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,470
Okay, okay, okay.

195
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,870
Morning!

196
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,080
Old Lei!

197
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,910
- Old Lei! Old Lei!
- Don't shout!

198
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:10,430
- He resigned.
-His things are still here.

199
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,490
You must be joking.

200
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,370
Fang Wei, what are you doing?

201
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:16,450
He's really gone.

202
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,690
Even his tea set is gone.

203
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,830
When Old Lei isn't here,

204
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:27,320
it really feels like we lost something.

205
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,360
Why didn't he think it through?

206
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,640
Just to endure two more years, then he'd be able to retire.

207
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,120
- Two years go back quickly.
- No more talking, okay?

208
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,920
I think he actually thought it through.

209
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,660
Now, he's resigned, he gets to be free.

210
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,960
He's gone?

211
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,250
It isn't a workplace without people coming in and out.

212
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,610
Did your father teach you that?

213
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,350
What's wrong with that?

00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,220
Xie Yi, I...

216
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,440
I want to explain a little to you.

217
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,800
The person you need to explain to is Old Lei.

218
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:39,490
Do you believe that I'll drag you across the floor?

219
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,260
Director Zhou isn't here, so Director Wei said,

220
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,320
I should lead this meeting regarding the matter of payments.

221
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,000
Stop messing around!

222
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,220
Everyone is here?

223
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,850
Yes. Everyone is here.

224
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:55,760
Think about who hasn't made their payments yet.

225
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,740
Old Lei should've some.

226
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,880
Previously, he was working on a health-related project.

227
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,920
It's for that difficult President Lu.

228
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,130
With the current situation, I don't know who will take care of the project.

229
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,040
Introduce the project's detailed content.

230
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,550
Okay.

231
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,680
Sheng Kang is the leader in Beijing's health industries.

232
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,560
At the end of last year, Old Lei and Sheng Kang's President Lu agreed on a coordination agreement and signed it.

233
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:24,570
The contract is for... for...

234
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,720
It was for... twenty four million.

235
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,710
Currently, the project is complete, but they still owe us nine million.

236
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:35,290
- What's up with the delay?
- I've met with President Lu only once.

237
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:38,150
However, I heard from Old Lei that President Lu is very strange.

238
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,310
It seems that she's difficult to deal with and rarely shows her face.

239
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:44,260
However, I heard that she spends most of her time at the beauty parlor.

240
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,020
What should we do then? Will you follow up with her?

241
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,320
Old Lei only said that he's leaving the client with me.

242
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,020
He didn't say for me to go after the payment.

243
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,810
A part of your responsibility as a salesperson is to make sure you get your payments.

244
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:56,700
If you don't think you can handle this, hand your project over to someone else.

245
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,270
This Sales performance is dependent on a competent team member.

246
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:02,020
How can this be? This is what Old Lei handed over to me.

247
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,650
That's why I asked you to follow up.

248
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,960
I can go with you.

249
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,430
That won't be necessary.

250
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:13,910
All right! Who else?

251
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,620
He has one.

252
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,040
Tell me about it!

Brother Dong! Brother Dong, I really do regard her as a friend.

- I want to help her, but—
- We don't have friends in the workplace.

255
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,320
Follow up on your own clients.

256

Director Zhou won't give you a second chance.

257

Xiao Yun, I don't know what to tell you.

258
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:50,680
Do you know who is the most miserable after a battle?

259
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,380
- Those who die.
- No.

260
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,020
It's those who got abandoned.

261
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,620
Put it on my card.

- Hello, President Lu!

She ran when she heard Jieke.

268
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,000
She keeps evading her debts.

271
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:27,300
I want to buy a bottle of water, and then, I'll transfer the money to you after I add your WeChat.

272
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,790
You can transfer me the money through WeChat but can't buy the water with it?

Bro! Bro! Bro, can you lend me one yuan?

I made a bet with someone and just need one more yuan.

277
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:48,880

278

Can you lend me it?

280
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:54,970
I just got scammed out of ten yuan.

281
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,910
Scammers are resorting to scamming even one yuan now.

282
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,960
Do you have one yuan in a coin?

283
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,090
My bike chain broke, soI need to tighten it.

284
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:04,140
There are so many bikes up there, isn't it just as good to switch yours for another one?

285
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,380
You're so inflexible.

286
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,930
Little friend.

287
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,560
Do you have one yuan?

288
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,930
No.

289
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:20,450
How did you buy your lollipop then?

290
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,980
Do you want some?

291
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,820
You can enjoy it yourself.

292
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:46,100
- All right, let go of me.
- Wait!

293
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,240

294
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:15,340
It's my first time meeting your parents.

295

I'm embarrassed to have come empty-handed.

296

Jia Jia, why did you come back on your own?

304

Didn't your dad go to pick you up?

305

Nice to meet you, Auntie!

308
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,120
Yes.

309

- I'll look for it myself.
- What is he doing?

310

Ignore him, Mom!

312

If you put this on where the needle was, it won't swell up.

313
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,340
Don't you believe me?

It's nice.

00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:03,980
It's kind of cool.

317
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,700
Have you eaten yet?

318
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,370
- What do you want to eat? I'll prepare it for you.
- Okay. Thank you, Auntie.

319

- Mom, he already ate.

When did I eat? I haven't eaten yet.

You've already eaten.

322
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,420
I haven't eaten.

323
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:25,200
I said you already ate, then you've eaten.

324
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,540
Fine! I ate. I already ate.

325
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:31,800
I won't eat. I won't eat at all.

326
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:50,340
What are you doing?

327
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,190
Jia Jia's friend, you...

328
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,730
- Auntie.
- What's your name?

329
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:06,780
J-Just call me Zhou Rui.

330
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,400
Yes. It's the Zhou from Zhou Gong,
(TN: Also known as Duke of Zhou)

331
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,610
and Rui from sharp.
(TN: Pinyin for sharp is "rui li")

332
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,900
It's a good name.

333
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,560
Not even the sharpest of knives can hurt the Duke of Zhou.

334
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,760
It's just a dream, isn't it?

335
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,600
Great description!

336
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,610
Have a seat!

337
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:28,380
Jia Jia, come with me for a second.

338
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,420
Why are you treating this like it's your home?

339
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:46,110
It's the most basic quality a salesperson should have.

340
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,700
Sit here!

341
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,860
Talk!

342
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,160
Talk about what?

343
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,670
How long have you been with Zhou Gong Rui?

344
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,620
What did you call him?

345
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,880
We aren't together.

346
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,920
I'm serious.

347
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,320
We really aren't.

348
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:34,030
They firmly believe that tofu skin

349
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:37,090
is exactly the great inventors of tofu.

350
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:39,730
Why did you bring him home if you aren't together?

351
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:45,120
He stayed with you the entire night at the hospital, didn't he?

352
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:49,460
He even knows to use potatoes to stop the swelling.

353
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,070
You won't tell me the truth, will you?

354
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:56,170
I'll ask him later, then.

355
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,270
Mom, there's really nothing going on between us.

356
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:04,620
We can't even be considered colleagues.

357
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,040
We just work in the same industry.

358
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,950
Now that your dad isn't here,

359
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:11,570
tell me before your dad comes home.

360
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:13,120
What exactly is going on?

361
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,110
Why does everything about you seem wrong this time you come home?

362
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,340
It's probably because it's been a while since I've come home.

363
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,920
Everything feels strange.

364
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:27,460
Fine! You don't want to tell me, do you?

365
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:37,480
Then, does Zhou Gong Rui know about what problem you're hiding?

366
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,210
I didn't tell him anything.

367
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:47,130
If there really was something wrong, I would've told you before I told him.

368
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:48,840
Mom, don't try to get any information from me.

369
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,340
We really aren't together.

370
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:56,110
He's already here, we can't just kick him out.

371
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,110
Where is he going to stay?

372
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,000
In the storage room.

373
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:08,130
It has long been part of the Chinese history

374
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:10,800
and ancestors in the countryside, too.

375
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,720
Who is that?

376
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,900
President Lin?

377
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,960
President Lin, you still haven't leave yet?

378
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,650
It still isn't that late yet.

379
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:40,510
Why is everyone in the Sales department gone already?

380
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,550
Hasn't the Sales department been always like this? They never stayed in the office during work hours.

381
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:48,850
Besides, their boss, Director Luo, hasn't been here in days.

382
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,910
I'm telling you, Bian Hai Tao!

383
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:54,090
Stop gossiping about them to me.

384
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:58,660
Should I ask them all to come back?

385
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:03,300
What then? Pay them overtime?

386
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,410
[Wei Yan]

387
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,330
- Hello?
- President Lin.

388
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:21,180
There's some bad news.

389
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,520
The bank has approved Jieke's loan.

390
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:28,880
All right. I got it.

391
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,400
Hello? Did you find him?

392
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,400
Keep going! Continue to look!

393
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,270
Can you stop calling?

394
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:43,570
Your apprentice eloped and can't be found.

395
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:45,140
What good is it to keep on calling?

396
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,240
Who did he elope with?

397
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,980
Don't pretend you don't know!

398
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,730
Which girl? I really don't know.

399
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:56,210
Don't be so curious!

400
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:58,150
Just consider giving him some time off.

401
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:01,350
Zhou Rui has been working for you day and night since he came.

402
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:04,400
Give him a break! Come on.

403
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:09,110
President Chen.

404
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:11,190
- Sister Wei.
- Old Lei.

405
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,390
You haven't been here in so long.

406
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:15,890
It's full of elites in here, so I dare not come.

407
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,510
- Are you okay with this?
- Yes.

408
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,360
Bring us another glass!

409
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:25,670
Have you completed the resignation formalities?

410
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:29,610
I completed it as you instructed.

411
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,160
- I can do it myself.
- Let me! Let me!

412
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:38,510
That's good! Thank you.

413
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:41,540
I can't get that rascal Zhou Rui

414
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,440
to come back, no matter what.

415
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,930
The board of directors are also pressuring me to fire someone.

416
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:50,310
I'm sorry to make you do this.

417
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:54,620
When Zhou Rui comes back, he'll help you get another position.

418
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:57,090
It just so happened that I wanted to take a break.

419
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:04,360
With just one sip, I know that this wine is for me to drink.

420
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:10,350
Sister Wei is still the same as always.

421
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,280
Here!

422
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,540
I got it!

423
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:28,650
Gong Rui, can you drink?

424
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:31,050
I...

425
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,540
I'm okay. Drink with my dad!

426
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:41,030
Zhou Gong Rui, I won't be drinking with you.

427
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:43,320
I just took some antibiotics.

428
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:46,830
Auntie and Uncle, thanks to both of you.

429
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,030
Thank you for your hospitality.

430
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,860
Welcome to Saihanba!

431
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:52,220
- Drink what you can.
- Okay.

432
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:01,450
Good! Good wine! Good wine!

433
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:06,270
A-Auntie, w-what is this?

434
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,030
Soba noodles!

435
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,520
Soba noodles?

436
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,170
It's made from buckwheat flour.

437
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:13,510
It's said that when he was still alive, Kangxi also ate this
(TN: The 3rd emperor of the Qing dynasty. His 61-year reign makes him the longest-reigning emperor of Chinese hisory.)

438
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,380
when he was hunting in the Mulan imperial hunting park.

439
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,240
- Isn't it delicious?
- Yes.

440
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,460
- Dad.
- It's tasty.

441
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:21,340
Zhou Gong Rui...

442
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,070
Zhou Gong Rui is from the south.

443
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:26,060
- His throat is too narrow to swallow this.
- Who said that? I can swallow this.

444
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,320
I like it. Really!

445
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,810
Do you eat raw garlic?

446
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:34,860
You lose half of the nutrients, if you don't eat buckwheat with garlic.

447
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,320
- Here!
- Okay.

448
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,450
Add some black vinegar.

449
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:42,220
This is black vinegar. This...

450
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:45,560
Uncle, here's a toast to you.

451
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,900
Have some food before you drink.

452
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,150
- There's also some grilled meat.
- Okay.

453
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,090
Here! Here! Here!

454
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:26,520
Gong Rui, do you like Baozipi?
(TN: the bread portion of steamed buns)

455
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,820
Sister, good to see you again.

456
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,450
Please, come inside.

457
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:56,140
Take it easy!

458
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,340
Miss, is this your first time here?

459
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,870
Yes. I want to look around.

460
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:06,490
I'm sorry, Miss! We're for members only, so you can't look around.

461
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:09,690
- How much is the membership?
- We have several tiers.

462
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:11,860
The basic is twenty nine thousand eight hundred.

463
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:15,590
- The higher one is thirty nine thousand eight hundred, and sixty nine—
- Hold on! Hold on! Hold on!

464
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,690
Mr. Long, I want to ask you a favor.

465
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:36,610
Accelerate! Just hit him!

466
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:38,960
I just don't believe that he won't get out of the way.

467
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:42,370
- Hit him!
- Come on.

468
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:45,810
- Come on!
- Accelerate!

469
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:51,100
Hit me! Come on!

470
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,900
Okay.

471
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,890
Brother-in-law!

472
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:01,720
It isn't like I'm getting an inheritance from you.

473
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,890
Why do you keep avoiding me?

474
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:06,650
- Open the door. Open it!
- Let him in!

475
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:16,660
You should've told me earlier that you were Young Master Cui's sister.

476
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:19,620
Young Master Cui's mother is one of our biggest customers.

477
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,450
Young Master Cui already told us on the phone

478
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:25,390
to take care of you because of your poor health.

479
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,290
My health is poor?

480
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:30,160
What's wrong with me?

481
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:35,870
I know that that you were diagnosed with a terminal illness at such a young age.

482
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:38,440
- I can understand how you feel, but please be at ease!
- Stupid Cui Long.

483
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,170
- Medical facilities nowadays are amazing.
- B*stard!

484
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:42,440
You have to believe in yourself.

485
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:49,350
Miss, which room is President Lu in?

486
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:51,110
- You are?
- I'm her assistant.

487
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,600
I have her phone and I want to hand it to her.

488
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,060
Okay. That's the room.

489
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,870
Our President Lu is always so forgetful.

490
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:00,020
She's getting older, so she's confused.

491
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:05,720
I don't have money!

492
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,750
It's just a mere fifty million.

493
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,670
A mere?

494
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:13,300
I just paid off your twenty-million debt.

495
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,780
- Mere?
- Really!

496
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,800
That was an accident.

497
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,170
Brother-in-law, help me one more time.

498
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:23,450
I'll definitely pay you back in full with interest.

499
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,080
Let's do this!

500
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:30,980
In addition to the twenty million from last time, it comes out to be seventy million.

501
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:34,310
I want to own fifty one percent of your company.

502
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,190
Let's do this, Brother-in-law!

503
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:45,790
I'll pay you the highest interest rate on private loans.

504
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:48,100
This... This... Forget the shares!

505
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:52,070
It's like you're trying to scam me of my money.

506
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:54,200
Are you addicted to losing money?

507
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,850
You win some, you lose some.

508
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:58,690
I'm losing money now to win later.

509
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:00,150
Isn't that what you always say?

510
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:03,320
Poor, but still strong, never giving up on your ambitions.

511
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,100
Don’t worry that no one would appreciate you! Just understand where you are heading to.

512
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,280
In this world, under the sky, who doesn’t know you?

513
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,880
Brother-in-law,

514
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,920
look at this!

515
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,250
[Fast Future Technology Cloud Computing Project Proposal]

516
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:16,380
You've even created a fake project proposal

517
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,770
to try to cheat me of my money.

518
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:22,640
Brother-in-law, this is cloud computing.

519
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,800
I'm telling you! As long as we succeed in this,

520
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:30,770
we'll be able to ring the bells in the near future.

521
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:34,210
Ring the bells? It will be ringing your death knell!

522
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,530
What century is this?

523
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:39,700
Brother-in-law, don't get so riled up!

524
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:42,250
Brother-in-law,

525
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:46,200
think about the fifty million.

526
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:50,520
If we were to convert the previous twenty million into shares,

527
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,260
it would be worth five percent at most.

528
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,300
Pull over!

529
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,830
- Get out!
- We aren't there yet.

530
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,910
Get out!

531
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,420
A man without foresight!

532
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,500
He doesn't even understand cloud computing,

533
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,730
but he calls himself an internet-guru.

534
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:34,050
It's hard to live up to a great reputation.

535
