22
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,340
The proposal you gave Director Cai is from Hong Guan, isn't it?

23
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,470
Do you know the company can fire you because of that?

24
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,280
The company can't fire me right now.

25
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,150
I'm pregnant.

26
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,960
You are using this excuse to take that chance, aren't you?

27
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:14,220
Director Zhou, I initially didn't have many clients.

28
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,580
Director Cai was my only chance!

29
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,890
- It's too hard!
- No matter how hard it is, you can't disregard a bottom line!

30
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,940
If you don't know how to do a proposal, you could've come to me.

31
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,350
If Director Cai wanted a kickback, you could say no.

32
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,440
There are so many things I want to say no to.

33
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,580
Our company comes up with a new target performance number every week, can I say no to them?

34
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,220
Director Zhou, I'm pregnant.

35
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,490
You wanted me to meet with clients, I went.

36
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,290
You wanted me to work overtime, I did that, too.

37
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,930
How am I different from any other employee?

38
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,330
I'm married, so what?

39
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,130
If my husband is a sales rep, so what?

40
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,590
It still doesn't deserve a death penalty, does it?

41
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,250
Calm down! Take a seat.

42
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,040
I'm not sitting.

43
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,980
Sit down.

44
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,170
I moved to Beijing initially from a small town.

45
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:15,060
After working hard for so many years,

46
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,590
it wasn't easy for us to buy a two bedroom apartment.

47
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,390
Because of the monthly mortgage,

48
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:27,720
we're living paycheck to paycheck.

49
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,720
Because of your cloud technology,

50
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,660
it ruined my annual performance.

51
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,920
If my husband loses his job,

52
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,910
I really don't know how we'd survive.

53
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,310
It's all right.

54
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,070
We'll find a solution.

55
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,180
Don't cry anymore!

56
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,350
- Sister Yun, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

57
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,020
Sister Yun!

58
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,320
Sister Yun! Are you okay?

59
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,160
Sister Yun! Sister Yun!

60
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,370
Sister Yun!

61
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,310
- Call 120!
- She's awake, she's awake!

62
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,550
-Scared me to death!
- Why did she suddenly faint?

63
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,160
People all say dating someone in the same industry is a taboo.

64
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,800
What's your plan?

65
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,280
- Help her up. Hurry and help her up!
- Slowly, slowly!

66
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,780
Let her sit for a bit. Get the chair, the chair.

67
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,630
Take a breath. Take a breath.

68
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,420
We can only go to a restaurant that's over 10 kilometers away.

69
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,370
If we want to be intimate, we can only hide at home.

70
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,630
Is this the romance that you want?

71
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:12,710
Easy! Easy!

72
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,460
Why are you sweating so much?

73
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,550
Sister Yun, are you okay?

74
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,160
I'm fine.

75
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,510
- Jia Jia.
- Every day, you...

76
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:30,020
get up early for work and come back late.

77
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,450
You even take care of me.

78
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,280
Is this the life you want?

79
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,980
I think it's quite good. Very consistent!

80
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,310
I get the feeling that you're unhappy.

81
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,200
I'm happy! How could I be unhappy?

82
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,490
I even want to resign and stop working.

83
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:55,320
How can you resign?

84
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:00,700
No matter what, you still need to support your aging mom and dad, don't you?

85
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,610
You can't become a housewife.

86
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,470
Look at what you are saying!

87
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:14,060
I don't believe professional women can't become housewives.

88
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,220
If you can't, you just can't.

89
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,490
A woman...

90
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:24,200
cannot lose herself over love.

91
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,730
Can you rub a bit harder?

92
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:44,220
It's like you're just scratching.

93
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,570
I may as well go back to my room to lie down.

94
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,580
How about now?

95
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,100
Being a housewife!

96
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,320
Over here! You got it wrong.

97
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,490
You seriously can mess it up.

98
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,220
What's the matter?

99
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,610
I called you, why didn't you pick up?

100
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,560
I didn't know what to say on the phone?

101
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:54,370
Didn't you want to tell me about work and that issue with Xiao Yun?

102
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,490
I'm annoyed enough.

103
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:59,910
Don't give me more trouble, either!

104
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,550
You want to change the rules of the profession.

105
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:07,640
I'm not happy. Didn't I hold it back?

106
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,410
When I want to change the rules in the profession, why can't you coordinate with me?

107
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,200
Do you know what rules of the profession you want to change?

108
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,020
If you don't even know, how can I coordinate with you?

109
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:22,940
I want to change the rule that competitors in the same profession can't date!

110
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:29,590
- These... these ... are two separate matters.
- It's one and the same matter!

111
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:32,280
I don't want to hide around anymore.

112
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,650
Give me a little more time!

113
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,850
I've finally caught you today.

114
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,210
Why did you take so long to throw away trash?

115
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:43,550
It turns out you ran into someone you knew.

116
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,450
You're... you're...

117
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,710
You're Luo Jia's colleague, aren't you?

118
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,000
- Hello!
- Hello.

119
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,320
I'm Luo Jia's boyfriend, Du Heng.

120
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,290
President Du, hello!

121
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,130
What's the matter?

122
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,310
President Du, why-why are you here?

123
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:15,190
I was going to ask you that, why are you here?

124
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,010
I live upstairs.

125
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:26,910
Right! You told me that before.

126
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,760
Are you done yet?

127
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,580
- I... I...
- You're stalking me again. What do you want?

128
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:56,350
- I'm not—
- What do you want?

129
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,620
I'll talk to her.

130
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,770
Alright, enough.

131
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,080
Are you done chatting?

132
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,090

00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,460
I didn't do that for you.

157
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,930

00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:34,640
She doesn't want to listen to any apology from you.

161
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,390
You're already together,

162
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:40,350
why wouldn't you bravely admit it?

163
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,110
♫  You deserved it, someone said  ♫

164
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:48,190
♫  It would be for the best that the story stays unfinished ♫

165
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,920
Zhou Rui, I want to ask you this.

166
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,380
You also aren't the kind of person who doesn't take on responsibility.

167
00:13:54,380 --> 00:14:01,100
♫  Those words were only spoken halfway  ♫

168
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:05,020
♫  When those few words reached the tip of the tongue  ♫

169
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,430
♫  It would take several years to accept  ♫

170
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:15,170
♫  Whose heart is closed midway from now on  ♫

171
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:22,580
♫  Locking up all the endless insomnia in the past?  ♫

172
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:29,270
♫  Some words are only spoken halfway  ♫

173
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:33,260
♫  To adjust the emotional intensity afterwards  ♫

174
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:36,760
♫  Just air-dry it slowly with time  ♫

175
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:43,360
♫  Whose heart will miss a half from now on  ♫

176
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,590
♫  Just let it totally submerge  ♫

177
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:51,130
♫  My remaining dimness  ♫

178
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:58,250
♫  The other half  ♫

179
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:04,290
♫  The other half  ♫

180
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:11,670
♫  The other half  ♫

181
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,410
This is the solid proof.

182
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:39,150
I've finally caught you today.

183
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:44,390
Why is it so short? What happened later? What did you cut out?

184
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:48,120
Later... Later on, Du Heng came.

185
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,810
Du Heng is dating Luo Jia?

186
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,360
How is that possible?

187
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,480
You didn't see Luo Jia's gaze at the time; it was very complicated.

188
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,430
- It's, at least, a love triangle.
- President Lin, the guest has arrived.

189
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:03,240
- President Lin.
- You've come.

190
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:08,610
You got the highest score again in our last series of Celebrity Boss Office.

191
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:11,000
Okay. This is Wang Yi Nan.

192
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,100
Linda isn't an outsider. Show her the video!

193
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,830
- Hello.
- Hello!

194
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,510
What video?

195
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,130
- Just take a look.
- Here!

196
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:30,930
I was wondering why she couldn't progress as normal whenever there was something to do with Jieke.

197
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:34,750
I treated all those old rumors as gossip.

198
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:40,300
But now, it seems it's already affecting Huikang.

199
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,490
It scares me when I think of it.

200
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:46,230
This matter is actually quite normal.

201
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:06,350
- It's really rare to see you in the office.
- Really?

202
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:10,200
I often see your shadow glide past.

203
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,310
I'd like to invite Director Luo to join the Broad-View Forum again.

204
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:17,630
- What's the topic?
- About romance in the same profession.

205
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,220
You should already know about Jieke's incident, shouldn't?

206
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,630
I think, as a representative of professional women,

207
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,080
you should say a few words.

208
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,420
I don't have anything to say.

209
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,280
Fine!

210
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,950
- Here! This is for you.
- Director Luo, how about this?

211
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,970
You have my WeChat, don't you? The topic is unchanged.

212
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,310
When you've thought it through, you can WeChat me anytime.

213
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:57,650
- Are you okay, Sister Yun?
-No problem. Thank to all of you.

214
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,340
Wait a moment!

215
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:03,470
Today, I have two thanks to express.

216
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:06,730
The first is to thank everyone for taking care of Xiao Yun.

217
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:09,500
The second is to thank...

218
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,300
Thank my wife, Xiao Yun.

219
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,210
She's let me, starting from today,

220
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:19,710
enjoy the life I've dreamed of.

221
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,600
You all, don't listen to him!

222
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,670
- He's probably holding something bad in.
- Brother-in-law, tell us!

223
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,310
Brother-in-law, say it, say it!

224
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:30,960
I'm going to get used to be supported by a woman.

225
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:36,550
I'm so envious!

226
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,700
I've decided that I'll resign.

227
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,290
Xiao Yun will keep working.

228
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:43,900
After you've given birth, you'll make money, and I'll take care of the baby.

229
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,630
I'm toasting with this up.

230
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:48,160
No, wait! This isn't what you said last night.

231
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,960
You were persuading me to resign.

232
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,310
You said my sales ability isn't as good as yours, and then...

233
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:57,640
- You also said that my customer base isn't as good as yours.
- No, no, no!

234
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:02,600
That's because I underestimated your potential and overestimated my ability.

235
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,110
Brother Zhen, why do you sound...

236
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,950
like you're a little jealous?

237
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,430
That... Brother-in-law!

238
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:13,700
Are you really going to live off your wife?

239
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,380
What if someday Sister Yun becomes Director Yun?

240
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,950
The days after will be...

241
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,230
What you're saying can't happen.

242
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,590
He's an idol! I admire him.

243
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:31,460
Otherwise, why would a beautiful woman like me bear a child for him?

244
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:36,060
Me? It's okay that I sacrifice a little.

245
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,600
Such as sales, it's good as long as she likes it.

246
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,250
I really don't like it.

247
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,480
I was fine before I was pregnant.

248
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,290
Now that I'm pregnant,

249
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:47,620
sometimes, I really think my brain can't keep up with everyone else.

250
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,440
- No, can't be.
- What? Impossible!

251
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,840
Especially, when she has a big belly and was humiliated by Party A.

252
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,380
I really couldn't understand it.

253
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,490
- You can't bear it.
- He can't bear it.

254
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:00,940
Whenever I think of it, I feel so aggrieved.

255
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,210
Sister Yun, drink one.

256
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,610
Come, Sister Yun.

257
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,510
Sister Yun.

258
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:09,080
- Brother-in-law, sorry that I'm late.
- Yao Yao is here.

259
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,640
Sorry, sorry! I didn't see.

260
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,110
This is something that Director Zhou asked me to give to the baby.

261
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,890
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Thank you.

262
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,730
I'm very grateful.

263
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:18,510
Sister Yun has something important to say.

264
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,110
Eat!

265
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,480
I've made up my mind.

266
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,730
I'm going to resign.

267
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,580
- Why?
- Don't ask!

268
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:35,470
Isn't it because a man should naturally make money to support the family?

269
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,090
That makes sense.

270
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,950
That can't be right, can it?

271
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:42,110
If you men want to make money, you all can have opportunities everywhere.

272
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:45,700
It's different with women, especially women who are with child.

273
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,050
Sister Yun, you don't have to make money, but you must have a job.

274
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,450
Bei Yao Yao, why are you talking so convoluted?

275
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,530
Isn't working about making money?

276
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,640
Then do you make money from your job?

277
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,490
I really don't work for making money, Bei Yao Yao.

278
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,780
So you aren't qualified to chat with me about this.

279
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:05,940
- Bei Yao Yao, when you came to Beijing, you announced to everyone—
- Cui Long.

280
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:09,000
Are you getting off topic?

281
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:14,870
- You said it well.
- Right.

282
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:17,010
Yao Yao, what do you want, I'll grab it for you.

283
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:20,350
Stop! Stop!

284
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,800
Something is wrong.

285
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,900
Are you all colluding to set up a trap?

286
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:31,990
Come on, Yao Yao! This... Have this bun.

287
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,280
Bei Yao Yao, try this one... this one...

288
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,470
- This one's really not bad—
- Zhen Xing Fu!

289
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:39,330
Did you utilize sales techniques on your own wife?

290
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:42,070
No, I didn't. I really didn't!

291
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:46,220
- It's their idea.
- Let me tell you!

292
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:49,240
I'm not resigning then.

293
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,960
Oh yes, I'm going to call Director Zhou right now.

294
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,190
Sister Yun, no need to call.

295
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:00,000
Director Zhou said, if you want to work, you can at anytime.

296
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,700
I'm having so much fun.

297
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,700
- It's unlike you.
- We've been exposed.

298
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,600
Sister Yun is amazing.

299
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,400
[Scumbag]

300
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,200
[Scumbag]

301
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,800
- Enter!
- Director Luo, Wang Yi Nan is here.

302
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,200
Let him in then.

303
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,800
Director Luo.

304
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,800
I'll accept what happened last night.

305
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,600
I can keep a secret.

306
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,240
I thought you already told President Lin.

307
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,800
I won't.

308
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,400
- You won't?
- I won't.

309
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,400
Didn't President Lin tell you to follow me?

310
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,500
I did it myself.

311
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,800
Wang Yi Nan, do you think I'm afraid of your blackmail?

312
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:23,100
Director Luo, you're the one saying the word blackmail.

313
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,100
It means you also know that,

314
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,400
the intimate images of Huikang's Director of Sales and the client

315
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,200
will become a scandal.

316
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,100
Was the scandal that you are talking about

317
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:36,200
when President Du was hugging me yesterday?

318
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,600
Zhou Rui really can't compare to you on this one.

319
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,520
I felt bad for you.

320
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:46,000
Even an idiot could tell that Du Heng was taking the blame for Zhou Rui.

321
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,700
But Zhou Rui acted all innocent like he was just fine.

322
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,700
Say it clearly then! What do you want?

323
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,000
I want to see what it looks like

324
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:01,580
when you're pushed into a corner and can't move.

325
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,800
I want to do what I want in Huikang.

326
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:01,580
We shouldn't have Du Heng between us.

327
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,600
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

328
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,800
You keep doing what you're doing; I'll stay with you for a while.

329
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,900
Say it!

330
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,600
Is there something you want me to help you with?

331
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,500
I want to propose to Luo Jia.

332
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,500
Really?

333
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,200
Have you thought it through?

334
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,600
Grandma.

335
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:41,850
The more I think, the more I hesitate, so I don't think anymore.

336
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,600
You still need to think when you have to.

337
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,800
When a man promises to get married,

338
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:00,500
there will be many things that you'll have to think about before you can make a decision.

339
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,800
Can you help the other person?

340
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:07,200
Can you help support the family in the future?

341
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,900
Also what else... personality, work,

342
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:16,000
and many things, you must think through and get clarity on.

343
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,500
Then you can make a decision.

344
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,570
Luo Jia is a good kid.

345
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:26,100
You mustn't disappoint her.

346
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,500
Wait for a moment!

347
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,400
This...

348
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:47,070
This is...

349
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,000
a ring that my mother gave me.

350
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,680
If you decide to do it,

351
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,800
take it and go to Luo Jia

352
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,000
to propose to her.

353
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,000
Okay.

354
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,400
Hi Linda! It's me, Luo Jia.

355
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,100
Hi, Director Luo.

356
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,400
I've adjusted my schedule, so I should be able to attend the next Broad-View Forum.

357
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,200
That's great!

358
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,800
But you must be mentally prepared for the main topic in this Broad-View Forum.

359
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,400
What do you mean? Are you setting up a trap?

360
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,000
You are a goalpost for professional women; we all have to follow you.

361
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,700
I wouldn't dare set a trap for you.

362
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:05,700
Don't worry! I'll jump into your trap with both feet, but I have a condition.

363
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,500
Name it!

364
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,720
In the next Broad-View Forum, Zhou Rui must attend.

365
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,400
That's it!

Today our guests are our old friends,

369
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,100
Zhou Rui and Luo Jia.

370
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,400
Director Luo, you go first.

371
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,200
I'll go first.

372
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,600
Go where?

[Question About Workplace Romance]

374
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,200
Talk about hidden romance.

375
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:02,600
Actually, I think it's not just in our sales circle.

376
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:07,000
Two people in the same workplace who are secretly in love, in order to avoid unnecessary trouble,

377
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,200
probably most of them would choose temporarily not to go public.

378
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,300
However, not going public will lead to other worries.

379
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,200
What types of worries?

380
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,500
- Loving each other and wanting to kill each other.
- Give some examples.

381
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,200
Well said!

382
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,000
If there are worries, why shouldn't one go public?

383
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:39,680
If this kind of relationship is revealed publicly,

384
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,600
the people who get hurt aren't just these two people.

385
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,400
There are also each other's companies and the people there.

386
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,800
When people fall into passionate love,

387
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:56,400
they always think nothing is as important as love.

388
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,000
However, after some time,

389
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,400
to pretend they don't know each other in front of everyone...

390
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,200
Why are you so annoying?

391
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,900
I'll tell you, Zhou Rui! With me, you're...

392
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:12,000
just a scumbag!

393
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,200
I can explain.

394
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:24,000
Two people are clearly intimate, but they have to act as cold as ice to each other.

395
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,800
I've finally caught you today.

396
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,720
Why did you take so long to throw away trash?

397
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,000
It turns out you ran into someone you knew.

398
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,400
Zhou Rui and you don't have anything with each other, do you?

399
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:40,000
What else is there between competitors in sales?

400
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,620
Even having a date,

401
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:45,500
it still has to be done as if it's a forbidden romance.

402
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,440
Thes...

403
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,970
- These are the two sides of the same matter.
- That's right.

404
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:02,400
I believe, if these two people are in love

405
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:05,460
deeply enough,

406
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:08,040
love each other where they trust each other,

407
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,170
I believe they'll chose the most suitable method

408
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:13,190
to safeguard their love.

409
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:15,390
Let me ask you!

410
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:19,340
Then if a romantic rival appears, how does that work?

411
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,160
Say, I don't love you?

412
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,700
Or, say... I'm someone who doesn't love and doesn't marry.

413
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,850
It's difficult to lie, isn't it?

414
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:30,850
It's easy to fall in love, but it'll be difficult to get along.

415
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:33,360
Isn't that what they all sing about in the songs?

416
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:42,480
Director Zhou, I think what you might mean

417
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,870
that a secret workplace romance is a unique way to love.

418
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:49,550
Moreover, this way is a last resort, isn't it?

419
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:59,520
- You're probably right.
- Wrong!

420
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:03,010
Why should love take a backseat to a career?

421
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:07,320
It's because in each of our lives,

422
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:11,070
other than love, there are still many other—

423
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:13,250
Then let me ask you, Director Zhou!

424
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:18,680
If you fell in love with a competitor in the field and it's a deep love,

425
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,000
would you go public?

426
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:34,480
Admit it!

427
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,920
Admit it! If you're the man, just admit it!

428
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:46,870
Director's Zhou's silence seems a little long this time.

429
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:49,070
Look! The entire live audience,

430
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:54,440
including myself, we're all curious to know

431
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,850
how you'll answer Director Luo's question.

432
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:08,060
Then I'll answer first.

433
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:13,650
Zhou Rui and I are in love.

434
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,330
- What?
- Is that true?

435
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:17,910
This is such a big news!

436
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:20,350
Moreover, we're deeply in love.

437
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:23,670
Zhou Rui in the South,

438
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,150
Luo Jia in the North,

439
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,150
there shouldn't a separation of north and south anymore.

440
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:32,090
First of all, I want to congratulate the two of you.

441
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:36,500
- But next, I may have to—
- Next, I want to hear his answer.

442
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:50,580
Director Luo is right!

443
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:54,010
We're together.

444
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:56,110
He's admitted it! Once he's admitted it, he's worthless.

445
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:58,020
I can renegotiate on the price to acquire Jieke.

446
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,660
What if he denies it later?

447
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,190
Denies it?

448
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:05,690
Then he'd hurt Luo Jia.

449
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:11,920
However, this kind of announcement method

450
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,160
isn't what I wanted.

451
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,540
He's admitted it.

452
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,830
He's admitted it already!

453
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,890
Chairman Li, when do you have time?

454
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:31,240
Shouldn't we chat again?

455
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:37,850
Yi Nan, this result is quite dramatic.

456
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:41,500
President Lin, there's something that I'm not sure if I should say or not.

457
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,480
Say it!

458
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:47,430
Luo Jia's violation has caused a heavy loss to the company.

459
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:50,050
I think you should punish her severely.

460
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:55,280
Actually, what you want is for the company to fire Luo Jia,

461
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,050
or that she'd leave Huikang by herself.

462
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:00,570
- No, no. I'm just thinking—
- And then,

463
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:03,780
you can sit in the Director of Sales position.

464
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,330
Am I right?

465
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,040
Want Yi Nan, let me tell you the truth.

466
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:11,260
Even if Luo Jia leaves Huikang, you're still just Wang Yi Nan.

467
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:14,530
As to how high you'll climb and how far you'll walk,

468
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:17,360
it'll depend on your own achievements.

469
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:37,590
Okay, Chairman Li! You decide on the time and place.

470
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:40,220
This Broad-View Forum is completed.

471
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,420
Thanks for everyone's participation.

472
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,780
We'll see you again next week!

473
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,450
This is huge! If I were Luo Jia, I would quit. Isn't it great to just stay home?

474
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:51,300
If Zhou Rui quits, that works, too.

475
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,580
These kinds of people can go places easily.

476
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,470
Something looks strange.

477
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,970
Go, go, go! Don't look anymore.

478
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,010
I know that you love me.

479
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:09,070
You also know that I love you.

480
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:13,810
But why did you have to use this method to let people know?

481
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:20,510
Now, I have to bear the consequence of your impulsiveness.

482
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,650
Zhou Rui,

483
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:28,100
you can't talk to me like this.

484
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,960
Huikang's due diligence has been completed.

485
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:38,010
The price that Jieke is being acquired for will be revealed soon.

486
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:40,040
Why did you choose

487
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:46,220
to announce our relationship in such a style right now?

488
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,000
Have you really...

489
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,930
Have you really thought about

490
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:54,980
what the consequences for me would be?

491
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:57,180
What consequence?

492
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:00,330
Will Jieke disappear without you?

493
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:05,350
You think too highly of yourself.

494
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:08,360
However, I have to treat my team with respect.

495
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,800
Aren't we just in love?

496
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:15,910
Every day, so many people in the world are in love.

497
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,270
A woman

498
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:24,790
just doesn't want to stay in the shadows anymore.

499
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:29,810
She just wants to be loved under the sun.

500
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:33,890
Is that so difficult to understand?

501
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,890
Let me ask you then!

502
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,650
Why didn't you discuss this with me before?

503
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:46,740
I really wish that we had discussed it

504
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:49,950
and then decided how to do it.

505
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:52,360
Is that so hard?

506
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,290
Discuss?

507
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,590
Zhou Rui,

508
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:25,110
do you think we should just break up?

509
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:43,870
What's the matter with your Sister Jia? She was fine when she first came in.

510
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:46,080
Suddenly she changed for the worse. Scared me to death.

511
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,830
Where is she?

512
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,090
Over there.

513
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,440
You go.

514
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:09,870
Sister,

515
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:13,190
you're quite greedy.

516
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:15,480
You don't want any of them, do you?

517
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,010
- Don't touch. I want them all.
- You already have this pair.

518
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:26,330
You bought all these, but you've never worn them.

519
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:28,060
I told you to put them down! I want them all.

520
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,130
Can't you hear me?

521
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:36,700
Sister Jia,

522
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:40,690
if you're upset, you can talk to me.

523
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:47,870
I just want to try on shoes; I'm not upset.

524
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:49,500
Why would I be upset?

525
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,970
Can't I buy shoes?

526
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,480
Give me my phone!

527

♫ The sun is only shining halfway  ♫

00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:10,670
♫ The freckles on my face are bright and dark  ♫

♫ Oh... ♫

534
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,980
♫  Who sung the song halfway through  ♫

535
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:24,860
♫  Leaving behind the roars of the chorus in an empty room  ♫

♫ I... ♫

537
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:34,720
♫  Slowly tidied up the embarrassment of the dispersing crowd  ♫

538
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:42,760
♫  Who would abruptly break off the lingering care of the past?  ♫

539
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,520
♫  You deserved it, someone said  ♫

540
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:56,820
♫  It would be for the best that the story stays unfinished  ♫

541
00:43:56,820 --> 00:44:03,550
♫  Those words were spoken halfway  ♫

542
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:07,440
♫  When those few words reached the tip of the tongue  ♫

543
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,930
♫  It would take several years to accept  ♫

544
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:17,730
♫  Whose heart is closed midway from now on  ♫

545

♫  Locking up all the endless insomnia in the past?  ♫

♫  Some words are only spoken halfway  ♫

♫  To adjust the emotional intensity afterwards  ♫
