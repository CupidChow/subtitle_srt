00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,980
When making steamed buns, do you remember if my mom said

23
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:14,980
to soak the pine needles first?

00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,570
When making steamed buns, do you remember if my mom said

25
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,040
to soak the pine needles first?

26
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,980
Director Zhou, do you still need anything else?

27
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,570
I'm sorry! Let me respond to my WeChat first.

28
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,350
All right.

29
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,060
She said it depends on your mood.

30
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,010
Then take a look and tell me what mood this is.

31
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:39,250
Where did you get such skinny caterpillar fungi from?

32
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,380
I grew them myself.

33
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,050
Goodbye.

34
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,510
Sister Wei, do you think I—

35
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,790
Do you think I made a mistake coming to Beijing?

36
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,020
You're already here.

37
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,790
What does it matter if it's right or wrong?

38
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:17,950
Jieke is bound to be acquired eventually.

39
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,940
We're in the capital market.

40
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,150
To be packaged up and acquired at a high price makes everyone happy.

41
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:29,420
However, my master doesn't want it and is forcing me.

42
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,740
But I think, I—

43
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,260
I didn't come here for that.

44
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,510
I forget who said it,

45
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,220
but the gist is that the most valuable part...

46
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,510
of the future isn't estate or energy,

47
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,000
but rather science and technology.

48
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:55,340
Master should know this.

49
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,300
He says he understands,

50
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,550
but he might not truly understand it.

51
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,320
Back then, your dad and your master parted ways because of this.

52
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,720
One said that technology is at the king.

53
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,110
The other said that sales is God.

54
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,500
Then between them,

55
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,510
who's right and who's wrong?

56
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:24,910
Reality proves that your master was right.

57
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,650
But he might not always be right.

58
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,590
What happens in the future

59
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:35,200
is up to what you guys do.

60
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,000
Up to us?

61
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,070
Sister Wei, my whole brain is reduced to mush.

62
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,390
What can I do?

63
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,460
Sister,

64
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:51,050
you and master have been together so much—

65
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,510
Director Zhou, you were looking for me?

66
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,870
Help me book a plane ticket for tonight.

67
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,910
You're leaving this late?

68
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,660
Some things can't be explained clearly through the phone.

69
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:09,140
Keep a close eye on all the things I requested in this afternoon's meeting.

70
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,840
All right.

71
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,650
Why don't I teach you one thing?

72
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,460
Everyone you're seeing right now

73
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,070
are all your potential clients.

74
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,210
Got it?

75
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,670
Shouldn't it be a setting one-on-one?

76
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,480
What do those lyrics say again?

77
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,880
It's a small world.
(TN: Referencing the song "Shan Bu Zhuan Shui Zhuan" by Naying)

78
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,120
I got it.

79
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,020
If you have any issues, discuss it in the group chat.

80
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,480
What business trip are you going on so late in the night?

81
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,320
Tomorrow's the weekend.

82
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,790
Can you bear leaving me alone?

83
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:11,510
Grandma, you're not familiar with Beijing. Don't go around haphazardly!

84
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,600
Relax.

85
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,030
The farthest I'll go is downstairs to buy groceries.

86
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,250
That's fine, isn't it?

87
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,340
When you leave, make sure to close the windows and turn off the air purifier.

88
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:28,450
Look at your nagging! Why are you like an old lady?

89
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:32,910
Grandma, besides me and Yang Lu,

90
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,360
who else knows your phone number?

91
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,210
Stop underestimating me.

92
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:46,890
Grandma, you aren't using WeChat Shake, right?
 (TN: WeChat Shake is a function that allows users to connect with new contacts/strangers.)

93
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,560
It's reliable.

94
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,710
Someone's inviting me to go shopping tomorrow.

95
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:55,870
- Grandma, let me see.
- I'm not showing you.

96
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,470
What if you're being swindled?

97
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,480
Swindle me?

98
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,240
- Unless I'm willing to be swindled.
- Let me see!

99
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,550
- It's just—
- Grandma, let me see!

100
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,120
I need to get my beauty rest.

101
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,770
Don't close the door!

102
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:15,250
Grandma, don't be swindled by someone!

103
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,230
I'm about to head out.

104
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,990
Thank you so much.

105
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,300
If you didn't help me today,

106
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,260
then the shoe store wouldn't have cleaned up my shoes.

107
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,760
Where are you taking me?

108
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,050
I'm going to take a look first. I'll take you tomorrow.

Are you trying to scam me by running out in front of my car?

115
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,460
I'm here to repay my debt!

116
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,050
Repay what debt?

117
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,950
Get in the car!

118
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:52,020
You're so mysterious with your whereabouts.

119
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,750
Did you get some money?

120
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,710
There's a huge deal.

121
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:58,550
- How huge?
- Extremely huge.

122

Tell me more clearly!

123
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:04,040
Cloud... Cloud Computing.

124
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,070
Director Zhou, you're familiar with this, aren't you?

125
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:10,420
Do you want to start a cloud computing base with me?

126
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,370
You even know this?

127
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:18,820
Cloud is divided into I, P, and S.

128
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:22,360
No, no! It's infrastructure, platform and software.

129
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,560
I know you have amazing technology.

130

It's the...

Hold on!

132
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:35,330
Software! What kind of specific software, I'm not too sure.

133
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:38,910
However, I know you're missing S, so you can't Software.

134
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:43,700
I want to say that you have S so let's software together.

135

You're pretty good a tongue twisters. Dare to repeat it?

137
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,840
Really! I know how to get the money.

138
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,390
I'm not bluffing.

139
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,610
I just received a small investment.

140
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:06,120
I'm planning on investing in a cloud computing base.

141
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,630
Do you want a share?

142
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:12,350
You should know that my base of operation not only needs money.

143
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:15,910
It also needs qualifications. Can you do it?

144

Director Zhou, with me

Fine! Leave the proposal and I'll take a look at it first.

Okay.

148
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:32,140
I'll just leave my laptop here in the back.

- You have software.

- Of course!

- Okay.

I... I can't drink.

Can you please help me in a while?

00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,900
- I'm pregnant.
- Who are you fooling?

325
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,600
You're joking.

326
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,400
I threw up just now.

327
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,300
You're really pregnant?

328
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,120
Three months already.

329
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,790
Xie Yi,

330
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,000
I'm sorry!

331
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,360
I shouldn't have lied to you.

332
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:43,290
However, I'm really afraid of this job.

333
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:51,130
I'm afraid that when I come back, my position is gone.

334
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,420
I know a client.

335
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,380
Originally, she was a manager,

336
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:01,310
but after she come back from a maternity leave, she became a clerk.

337
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:04,830
You also know that people move around a lot in our company.

338
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,860
So I was afraid.

339
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,400
I didn't want to lie to you, either,

340
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,520
but I really didn't have any other way.

341
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:25,290
Don't cry anymore!

342
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:29,500
I'm so sorry!

343
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,480
Me, too!

344
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,480
I also have times when I've wronged you.

345
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,580
What is that?

346
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,690
When I finish drinking with you,

347
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,550
I'll tell you.

348
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,590
Okay.

349
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:50,030
Wait!

350
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,790
Watch Cui Long getting him wasted!

351
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:57,360
Don't get him wasted! Don't have Cui Long get him wasted.

352
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,870
He's my client.

353
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:04,400
Why are you so late?

354
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,660
This is only two-wheeled.

355
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,730
I'm already fast enough.

356
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,060
Send Director Mei home in Cui Long's car first.

357
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:19,130
How many directors did you get drunk?

358
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:23,780
Move!

359
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:27,330
Allow me!

360
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,830
Have you finished drinking, President Lu?

361
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,660
They have good morals.

362
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:37,740
- Wine is good.
- Bottoms up!

363
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,960
Don't!

364
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,950
Don't! Don't drink it!

365
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,450
Once you guys come here,

366
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:50,200
the mood in here

367
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,130
shot up immediately.

368
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,810
What are you doing?

369
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:02,850
He can't do it anymore.

370
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:09,570
President Lu!

371
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:13,100
Come back and continue drinking!

372
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,320
Slow down!

373
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:37,300
Haven't you left?

374
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,760
Be careful!

375
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,330
Watch out! It's slippery.

376
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:45,010
I'm okay.

377
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,860
Let's keep drinking.

378
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,310
Drink!

379
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,860
I'm fine, I tell you.

380
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:19,420
Sister Yun,

381
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,600
actually,

382
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,710
I forgave you a long time ago.

383
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:33,170
It's because I really wanted to resign.

384
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,780
But I just...

385
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,460
couldn't control the mouth of mine.

386
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,320
I didn't want to tell you that I forgave you.

387
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,220
I know.

388
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:48,720
You just have a sharp mouth, but a soft heart.

389
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,840
Actually, I...

390
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,340
am envious of you.

391
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:00,530
In Beijing,

392
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:03,310
you have a house.

393
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,820
You have a husband.

394
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:09,550
You even have a child now.

395
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:12,110
Me? I have nothing.

396
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:14,390
You still have me!

397
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:16,780
If you want to throw up, then throw up.

398
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:20,300
Don't use words to make me feel disgusting.

399
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:27,960
No.

400
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,950
What kind of taxi driver are you?

401
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,660
You are car-pulling, but you've made it into such a horrible mess.

402
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:35,000
I'll sue you. I'm going to sue you!

403
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,750
Stop throwing up!

404
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,720
Luo Jia,

405
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:34,650
if you message the jerk first,

406
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:37,230
I'll lose respect for you.

407
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,830
The materials I asked for last night,

408
00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:00,130
send them over to my phone quickly.

409
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,630
You people do sales, you should still be responding to messages, shouldn't you?

410
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:21,290
[Huikang Work Group Chat (13)]

411
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:25,300
Speak!

412
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:26,910
Who is it?

413
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:29,740
Take-out! I've put it outside.

414
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:41,690
I didn't order take... out.

415
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:19,130
I didn't know if you wanted to have Western or Chinese food today.

416
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:21,300
Anyways, I got both.

417
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:25,390
Don't think that if you send me food, you can stop me from talking.

418
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,050
At least, when you are eating, you won't be able to talk.

419
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:39,560
You can stop me from talking for now, but not forever.

420
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,530
Do you want to eat with me?

421
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,440
Are you currently having barbecued pork bun?

422
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:23,140
I bet you're drinking coffee now.

423
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,290
Try the western kind.

424
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:23,870
How rushing you are! Can't you sit down first?

425
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:25,840
I'm meeting Director Mei. Have to go!

426
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,160
All right. Here, here, here!

427
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,920
Sister Yun,, do you know how to sew buttons on?

428
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:43,730
What am I, a princess? Of course, I do.

429
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,250
Sister Yun, much obliged!

430
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:51,400
- All right!
- Here!

431
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:56,890
Sister Yun! Sister Yun.

432
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:08,510
Sister Yun, is this your home?

433
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,630
It's my home.

434
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,730
Did you black out?

435
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,440
Your bed is so huge!

436
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,320
My Heaven! Since you are awake, come out and have breakfast.

437
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,030
Done!

438
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:33,450
- Aren't you eating?
- I'm good.

439
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:36,990
- Have you washed your hands?
- I'll just take one.

440
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:39,160
Wait... Use the chopsticks!

441
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,280
I've washed them, just now!

442
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,920
- Morning, Sister.
- Morning.

443
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:48,750
Why am I so hungry? Didn't I eat last night?

444
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:52,100
- Xie Yi, are you leaving or not?
- You ate more than you vomited.

445
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,560
Say! It was the irst meeting with Director Mei,

446
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,890
your love-hate drama was already on.

447
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:00,730
No way! I couldn't get drunk.

448
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:03,490
And what did you say?

449
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:05,600
"The entire Greater China Region,

450
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,290
even across Southeast Asia, is all my game."

451
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:10,010
What is the problem?

452
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,430
Xie Yi, are you leaving or not?

453
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,480
If she isn't, I am.

454
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,850
Give me a lift, won't you?

455
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:22,100
Spare me the subway.

456
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:27,270
Don't you know how to say "please?"

457
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,390
I'll take you.

458
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:34,130
Well, that'll be nice. Thanks, Brother-in-law.

459
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,290
- Where do you work?
- I... I... I...

460
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:39,090
I-I'm in ride-hailing service. Driving is working.

461
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,580
How much do you make?

462
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,050
Let's go!

463
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,170
What's on your mind?

464
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:07,560
Sister Yun, I miss home.

465
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,620
My home is your home.

466
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:12,780
Small as it might be and far way from the city;

467
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,490
however, if you want,

468
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:16,650
you are always welcome here.

469
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:19,560
I'm afraid I can't come anymore.

470
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,890
What's going on?

471
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,660
Sister Yun,

472
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:32,180
actually, I'm not suitable for sales.

473
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,060
But I'm also a procrastinator.

474
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:36,830
I haven't found a way to tell Director Zhou.

475
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:39,500
Thank goodness, you pushed me.

476
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,650
If that eloquence of yours doesn't belong in sales,

477
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:46,130
I’m a clumsy talker, it doesn't fit even more.

478
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,600
You don't have any other choice.

479
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,230
Even just for your kid, you have to hang in there.

480
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,760
It isn't the same for me.

481
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,050
I can move back home.

482
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:59,100
Go home?

483
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,890
My dad has already found me a nice job.

484
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,340
All stable.

485
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,720
I can spend more time with my folks.

486
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,630
Are you really letting go now?

487
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:15,080
What about that dream which may come true?

488
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,740
Sister Yun,

489
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:21,330
it's been tough for me to choose.

490
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:25,320
Please don't sway me now.

491
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,980
A few years back, I also returned home.

492
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,750
It wouldn't do.

493
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,820
Once you leave,

494
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,770
your return is only as a guest.

495
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,600
Sister Yun,

496
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,330
I know what you mean.

497
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:58,980
Besides, I also know my own problems

498
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,960
Speaking without thinking,

499
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,760
shooting only straight,

500
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,360
and never read the room.

501
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:08,590
But...

502
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:11,290
now, I'm still young.

503
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:13,820
Colleagues and clients

504
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:16,180
still put up with me.

505
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,170
What about later?

506
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:22,540
Then what about your network and clients?

507
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,410
You just leave them like that?

508
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,400
Actually, they're all Old Lei's.

509
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,690
Since you've already made up your mind,

510
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:39,530
I'll organize a farewell dinner for you to say your goodbyes.

511
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:42,330
No need, no need! Absolutely no need.

512
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,580
I fear that I'll regret it.

513
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,190
What about Director Zhou?

514
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:55,310
Director Zhou...

515
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,910
I haven't thought about that.

516
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:23,460
Director Zhou, I...

517
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:34,780
I admit I was a bit hasty when I turned in my resignation.

518
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:38,430
However, I'm telling you, I'm really going. No explanation!

519
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:52,440
I give you 3 seconds to change your mind.

520
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,180
One,

521
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,650
two,

522
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,870
three.

523
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,600
Go for it!

524
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,970

❝ One Half ❞ by Mo Fei Ding Lu

526
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:55,130
♫ The sun is only shining halfway  ♫

527
00:40:55,130 --> 00:41:00,890
♫ The freckles on my face are bright and dark  ♫

528
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:03,550
♫ Oh... ♫

529
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:09,200
♫  Who sung the song halfway through  ♫

530
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:15,050
♫  Leaving behind the roars of the chorus in an empty room  ♫

531
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:18,060
♫ I... ♫

532
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:24,950
♫  Slowly tidied up the embarrassment of the dispersing crowd  ♫

533
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:33,010
♫  Who would abruptly break off the lingering care of the past?  ♫

534
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:35,710
♫  You deserved it, someone said  ♫

535
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:47,030
♫  It would be for the best that the story stays unfinished  ♫

536
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:53,760
♫  Those words were spoken halfway  ♫

537
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,420
♫  When those few words reached the tip of the tongue  ♫

538
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:01,160
♫  It would take several years to accept  ♫

539
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:07,830
♫  Whose heart is closed midway from now on  ♫

540
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:15,360
♫  Locking up all the endless insomnia in the past?  ♫

541
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:21,870
♫  Some words are only spoken halfway  ♫

542
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:25,870
♫  To adjust the emotional intensity afterwards  ♫

543
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:29,400
♫  Just air-dry it slowly with time  ♫

544
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:36,000
♫  Whose heart will miss a half from now on  ♫

545
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,910
♫  Just let it totally submerge  ♫

546
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:44,290
♫  My remaining dimness  ♫

547
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:49,900
♫  The other half  ♫

548
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,600
♫  The other half  ♫

549
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:04,340
♫  The other half  ♫
