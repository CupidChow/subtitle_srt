President Du has also agreed.

32
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,590
When it comes to negotiating, Director Luo truly has highly superior skills.

Don't be so weird! I'm not used to it.

34

When other people ask for help, they tend to lower their stance.

Director Luo is quite different.

36
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:56,100
Why do I feel that if I don't agree, I'll actually end up owing you something?

Let's not get into any of that stuff about what's high or low, okay?

The ultimate goal for us in sales is to keep the clients happy.

- Satisfy the clients, right?
- I like what you just said.

63
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,520
why do I feel that you don't think before you speak?

Before you came in,

65
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,460
I thought our cooperation was simply an idea in my head.

66
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,790
However, when you showed up in the flesh, sitting here,

67
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,850
I thought maybe my idea could become reality.

68
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,010
So that's why you're challenging my bottom line, isn't it?

What's up?

103
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,210
About the O&T project, I plan to give a portion to Jieke for our collaboration.

104
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,850
I won't talk about whether you even have this authority yet,

105
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,450
can you tell me why?

106
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,930
- Du Heng insisted.
- Isn't that insistence coming from Jieke behind the scenes?

107
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,780
I don't know about that.

108
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,850
Is the contract signed yet?

109
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,540
Not yet.

110
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,760
President Lin, this President Du is very strong.

111
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,500
So our only choice is to collaborate with Jieke.

112
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,000
Sit down.

113
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,400
I'm never against collaborations.

114
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,150
My question is, why do we have to collaborate with Jieke?

115
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,360
You're giving them a blood transfusion to extend their life.

116
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,410
It'll damage our acquisition plan.

117
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:35,620
In plain words, this is elevating Jieke's estimated price.

118
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,880
Getting O&T, this is the best opportunity for Huikang to crush Jieke,

119
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,950
to dominate and expand!

120
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:49,120
But at this moment, you're telling me that you're going to give them a hand.

121
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,850
However, the software and hardware system designed by Zhou Rui

122
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:57,120
is definitely more capable than ours to respond to O&T's potential demand.

123
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,570
What Jieke wants to do, I don't care!

124
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:10,530
How did Jieke and O&T conspire behind my back, I'm not going to guess, either.

125
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:15,590
All I care about is how you would allow this kind of situation to happen?

126
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:20,360
That's why President Lin, we're back at the beginning of our conversation.

127
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,070
We need to take advantage of our dominant position

128
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:24,630
to get this O&T project, and share a piece with Jeike.

129
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,880
We simply take the majority of it.

130
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,050
Cut them a small share and be done with it.

131
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:33,230
Otherwise... with Zhou Rui, that very unpredictable person,

132
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,720
just think of next year!

133
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,470
The year after that?

134
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:39,600
President Du could be totally controlled by Zhou Rui.

135
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,950
By then, there'll be nothing to do with us.

136
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,960
Based on what you said, does this Zhou Rui have...

137
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,510
three heads, six arms, and a green face with fangs?

All right. Then I'll take a step back.

If Zhou Rui is so incredible,

141
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,710
then bring him in as one of our teammates.

Then I'm going back to the beginning of our conversation.

144

If President Du insists, I don't care how we share the business.

145

00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:18,020
Be careful! Be careful!

175
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,840
Petty guy!

176
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,180
Hello, young man!

177
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,900
Can you move this thing somewhere else?

178
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,250
Why, Mr. Senior?

179
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,650
This... thing's back is facing directly towards me.

180
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,880
I-It's bad luck.

181
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,550
How about this?

182
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:48,290
Half Half. Does that work okay?

183
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:51,150
A-All right! Okay.

184
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:12,350
Why are you drinking soda this early in the morning?

185
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,090
Good Morning, President Chen.

186
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,320
Zhou Rui.

187
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,150
Master.

188
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,780
This is the wine I gifted to President Du.

189
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:20,610
President Du isn't good with alcohol, so he asked me to bring this excellent wine back to you.

190
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,840
Otherwise, it would be a waste.

191
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm getting old.

192
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I always think I'm doing the right thing.

193
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,100
But other people think otherwise.

194
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,280
Master, in my mind,

195
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,040
no matter what you do, it's all the right thing.

196
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,080
No matter what,

197
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:41,130
President Lin at Huikang must be more upset than anyone else.

198
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,890
For me, dignity isn't important.

199
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,020
That's right! I need to ask you.

200
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,950
Have you discussed the contract ratio with Huikang?

201
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,220
It's in a deadlock.

202
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,780
How much do we want and how much are they giving us?

203
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:07,890
I want thirty percent, but they are only willing to give us ten percent.

204
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:12,150
We can't do less than fifteen percent, otherwise it'll be difficult to shut the board of director's mouths.

205
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,010
It'll all depend on your hard work.

206
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,680
I understand.

207
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,510
What do you think about Du Heng?

208
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,020
He is a go-getter with broad vision.

209
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,580
For old salespeople like us,

210
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,000
wine is God.

211
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,930
Either we raise a toast or we kneel down to beg.

212
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:39,240
But for your generation, it isn't the same.

213
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,200
Even kneeling doesn't work.

214
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51,900
Who would've thought you'd be able to get the O&T project.

215
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,570
When the contract's a success, we'll drink it.

216
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:56,860
I'll try my best, Master.

217
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,500
That's right!

218
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,140
I sent a new employee to your sales team.

219
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,090
Are you mixing things up?

220
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,450
They're already a mess.

221
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:11,160
See if you can put them back together as a team.

222
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,840
I'm taking this.

223
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,640
Take a seat!

224
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,930
Let's do this our usual way.

225
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,750
Write down your preferred percentage on the paper.

226
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,110
I've already written down my own.

227
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,240
Let's talk after looking at the numbers.

228
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,060
[20%]

229
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,150
[20%]

230
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,630
Did you talk about it beforehand?

231
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,100
No. We didn't.

232
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:07,810
We met once informally, but failed to agree.

233
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,890
If you both agree on twenty percent,

234
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:14,210
then the rest of the time, we can use it to talk about our three-way collaboration.

235
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:17,730
For me, this is something we should celebrate.

236
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,300
Let me bring a bottle of champagne.

237
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,090
Wait for me!

238
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,720
25%

239
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,990
We calculated your cost of production.

240
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:52,450
For this bidding price, taking twenty percent doesn't put you at a disadvantage.

241
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,550
Let me see your hand!

242
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:59,050
- What did you say?
- I want to see your hand.

243
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:09,780
You're a meticulous woman. Not cute!

244
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,340
Whether I'm cute or not, isn't up to you.

245
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:15,690
Since we've already agreed on the price ratio,

246
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:18,080
we'll discuss our collaboration conditions next.

247
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,540
I don't think we'll be so synchronized this time.

248
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:25,090
Then tell me! Do you consider us teammates or rivals from now on?

249
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,900
Are you referring to Jieke and Huikang, or you and me?

250
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,950
You're overthinking it, aren't you?

251
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,880
How's the discussion? There aren't any problems, are there?

252
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,280
Director Zhou said I'm not cute.

253
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:45,070
Then what did you tell him?

254
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:47,880
We just wasted twenty percent of the bidding price on him.

255
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,090
He didn't even say thank you, what else can I say?

256
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:53,910
How about this? Once this collaboration has succeeded,

257
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,930
whom should I show my gratitude to?

258
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:59,280
We should always be thankful to our Party A.

259
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,140
The south has Zhou Rui, the north has Luo Jia.

260
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,710
I'm just taking advantage of both of you.

261
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,550
Wishing us a happy collaboration!

262
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,280
Late snacks are here.

263
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,680
Everone, come and grasp some!

264
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,810
Xiao Yun!

265
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:29,750
Your original flavor egg waffles.

266
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,910
Durian pancakes, milk tea,

267
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:35,610
no ice, half sugar, extra bobas.

268
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:36,600
- Thanks!
- Xie Yi,

269
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,190
your pan-fried beef noodles, less salt, less oil, but there were no more side vegetables,

270
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:43,550
I changed it for you. Crawfish!

271
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:47,090
- One catty of tongue-numbing spicy, savory spicy and sour spicy each.
- That's marvelous.

272
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:51,040
Old Lei, oh no! I forgot to get yours.

273
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,550
It's fine! You're doing it for my sake.

274
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:57,430
With my age, it's better to eat less this late.

275
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,270
- Director Zhou.
- Director Zhou.

276
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,470
I just texted you a message earlier, you didn't reply.

277
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:06,470
What would you like to eat? I can go now to get your order.

278
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,770
Working meals in Beijing are at a higher standard than in Hangzhou.

279
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:17,990
Th-this is a standard set up by Director Wei.

280
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:21,400
Director Zhou, we beat Huikang at the test this time.

281
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,880
Based on Director Wei's habits, we should be rewarded, shouldn't we?

282
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,200
What was the reward?

283
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,570
Last time, he gave us some money for a trip.

284
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:33,400
Director Zhou, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. You know Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, don't you?

285
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,750
Director Wei and I have different habits.

286
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,270
- We didn't say anything wrong, did we?
- Everyone, continue eating.

287
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:45,190
I'll go to explain.

288
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:47,410
Give some gloves here!

289
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:49,150
Director Zhou.

290
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:54,590
Everyone's worked hard all day, so I bought better food.

291
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:57,060
- It's a little over limit. It's okay, right?
- It's fine.

292
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:00,140
Same old rule! I'll pay for what's over the limit.

293
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,000
Tell me the amount.

294
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,330
Okay.

295
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,690
Everyone...

296
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,240
You remember everyone's usual order?

297
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,320
Y-yes, I do.

298
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,900
Pretty amazing?

299
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,240
It's my job.

300
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,250
Okay.

301
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:31,470
Director Zhou, should I tell everyone that this is your treat?

302
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,770
What to tell them for?

303
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:36,280
If it were me, I would wish the whole world to know that I was the one treating.

304
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,940
That's you.

305
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,860
Thanks.

306
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:55,260
I'm reading all of our company's information from the beginning.

307
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,410
You just entered the company and you're reading all this, is it hard?

308
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:01,350
It's a little difficult.

309
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,600
Look at people in sales!

310
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,490
Some sell houses, some sell shoes,

311
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:11,780
we sell servers,

312
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:15,090
programs, and service.

313
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:18,960
However, very few people think about what salespeople are really selling.

314
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:23,200
So, Sister Jia, what are we selling?

315
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,300
Connection.

316
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:30,180
We sell the connection online and the connection between people.

317
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:37,010
I understand it even less when you say that.

318
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:40,130
It's the same principle as how you sell shoes.

319
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:43,310
Ultimately, it's to win people's hearts.

320
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:55,020
Do you know why I resisted the pressure and insisted on getting you into this company?

321
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,670
It's because you've won my heart with your shoe selling.

322
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:06,540
Many salespeople don't understand this even until their death, but it's natural for you.

323
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:10,760
Sister Jia, when you say that,

324
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,130
it scares me just to hear it.

325
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,650
I'll keep trying my best!

326
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,180
Cheers!

330
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:43,780
"Luo Jia in the north, Zhou Rui in the south." Glad to meet you!

331
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:46,590
President Lin, your Huikang, during these past few years,

332
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:49,720
has been the leader among the online commerce companies.

333

So many awards! You've led well.

Running a company relies on the spirit of cooperation.

Of course, Luo Jia's sales is one in a thousand, one in ten thousand.

I'm sure you've felt this as well.

- Director Luo!
- I've respectfully felt it.

348
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,690
Acting? What act?

349
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,780
With whom?

350
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:07,560
Acting with my boss.

351
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:11,690
That's because your President Lin is a better actor.

352
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:19,750
[O&T Company Server Procurement Project Agreement]
[First Party: Huikang Company] - [Second Party: Jieke Company]

353
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:23,310
Zhou Rui, this contract of yours isn't readable.

354
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,590
Tell me! Are you a greedy snake that wants to eat an elephant,

355
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:31,220
or are you deliberately using these conditions to disgust me?

356
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:35,780
I... I was following our... principles in collaboration.

357
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,220
- After all, we're allies now.
- Allies?

358
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,350
What allies? Who would ally with you?

359
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:43,190
Clearly, I'm the one taking you to play.

360
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:48,310
If Jieke thinks twenty percent is too low, you can exit.

361
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:51,300
I'm doing this abiding by the twenty percent share.

362
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,810
I do the work based on how much I'm paid.

363
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:56,410
I'm telling you very clearly right now, I don't accept it.

364
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,930
There are so many conditions in this contract that I won't accept.

365
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:02,100
We can sit down and discuss each and every one of them right now.

366
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:07,450
Perhaps... there are other ways?

367
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:09,480
What other ways?

368
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,830
Let Du Heng raise the price.

369
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:14,270
How is that possible?

370
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:17,750
Let the client initiate raising the price, have you ever seen it?

371
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,580
I know it isn't easy.

372
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:22,650
Of course, I can't do this by myself.

373
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,170
Sure! Tell me more about it.

374
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:44,020
First of all, their maximum limit is definitely not this price.

375
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,620
It can't be much higher.

376
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,580
Based on my understanding of internet companies,

377
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:52,920
they increase their upgrades pricing every year.

378
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,800
The increased amount is also very high.

379
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,990
We can help them

380
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:00,270
spend a portion of the money for next year and the following year.

381
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:04,930
Of course, the service we provide is also enhanced every year.

382
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:08,440
The client is the ultimate beneficiary.

383
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:16,510
Zhou Rui, you asked me early on

384
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:18,550
"are you always so self-confident?"

385
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:21,060
Right now, I'm asking you that same question.

386
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:29,770
Most of the time, the customers don't know what they really want.

387
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:34,070
They need us to tell them, and Du Heng is no exception.

388
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:36,010
If I were Du Heng,

389
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:37,960
the two of us scoundrels would've been blacklisted already.

390
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:41,250
If I were him, and I met the two of us,

391
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:43,580
I would even wake myself from sleep with a smile.

392
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,560
But the premise is,

393
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,190
the two of us must stay united.

394
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:58,590
Actually, ultimately you'll gain the most.

395
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:04,920
- Such as?
- Such as...

396
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,710
Such as, after completing this, you'll, at least,

397
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:11,540
pull a long face away from your boss immediately.

398
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,850
Try it?

399
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:26,960
Zhou Rui, do you hate your boss a lot?

400
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,130
My boss is my mentor, so I dare not.

401
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:31,170
I respect him.

402
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,850
Then I'll head back to start working on the proposal, okay?

403
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:38,690
Go on back first! We'll see later.

404
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:42,130
Director Luo, why do I think you're flirting with me?

405
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:47,240
You're thinking too much.

406
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:50,380
This combination is the best for O&T.

407
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,840
With this storage capacity,

408
00:30:55,070 --> 00:31:00,090
It's going to increase and expand all of our equipment array.

409
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:01,680
And then...

410
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:05,010
then you can support our system operations for...

411
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:07,340
the next five years.

412
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,970
At the same time, you can guarantee

413
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:13,120
tens of thousands of terabytes of data backup.

414
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,910
However...

415
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:22,250
if we go with Huikang's quote,

416
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:27,310
this is only going to fulfill our short-term system management operations.

417
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:30,940
According to Huikang's quote, it can only satisfy...

418
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:35,480
Sorry, Director Zhou! My English isn't good, so I use a translator app to translate.

419
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,930
This is called utilizing something to its maximum capability.

420
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:44,800
It's called making the most of it.

421
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:53,010
Zhou Rui, is this what you want?

422
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:57,410
Five years? Okay, five years, anyway.

423
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:01,910
Director Zhou, this project that has no profit doesn't include the key performance indicator assessment.

424
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:04,890
In other words, there's no commission in O&T's order.

425
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:08,170
- You know that, don't you?
- I know. I know.

426
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:13,240
Wait! Sorry.

427
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:18,550
Why don't you find an excuse to not do overtime like the others do?

428
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:23,200
Why don't you find an excuse to not do overtime like the others do?

429
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,880
I have no excuses.

430
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,700
- I have no excuses.
- Patrick.

431
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:33,160
Clearly, Huikang is leading us to play in this project.

432
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,990
Not only is there no profit, there may even be losses.

433
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:37,940
That's why I have to make O&T

434
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:41,140
prepay for the next five years' service.

435
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,010
That's why we need to analyze

436
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:45,710
what their budget will be for the next year and the following year.

437
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,300
So...

438
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:50,770
Focus, please!

439
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:52,360
Okay.

440
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,160
Can you help me with something?

441
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,160
Call the co-workers in the sales department and the marketing Department.

442
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,380
Tell them to come work overtime. Okay?

443
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,040
Sure!

444
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,090
Director Zhou.

445
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:11,050
The contract is ready?

446
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:12,950
- Let's go to my office then.
- Okay.

447
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,990
Patrick, once you've calculated it, email me the numbers.

448
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,800
Yeah.

449
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:25,080
Overall, there weren't any problems.

450
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,690
However, there are still a few details that need to be adjusted.

451
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:31,660
Chao Dong, really! You're pretty good.

452
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:34,350
- I should.
- Wait a minute!

453
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:40,160
Fa... Fast... Fast case, I've already taken a look.

454
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,060
I want to hear your thoughts.

455
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,880
Come! Have a seat.

456
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,550
O&T and Fast, both companies do logistics.

457
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:55,350
One is in the city and another is in the countryside.

458
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:58,550
If we can get both, then our company can be considered

459
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:00,940
as having stability and roots in the logistics industry.

460
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,510
Director Zhou, about the O&T project,

461
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:09,970
should we discuss it with Director Wei?

462
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:13,740
- No need!
- Director Zhou, here's Director Cao's Qingyuan Chicken.

463
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:17,230
I had a Guangdong chef expertly prepare to be absolutely delicious.

464
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,430
Brother Dong, you should try it, too.

465
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:21,270
Let's dig in!

466
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:25,260
This chicken reminds me how Cao Tian You still owes me money.

467
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,940
Let's eat!

468
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,580
- Are you not eating?
- I am.

469
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,160
- Director Wei.
- Director Wei.

470
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:47,430
Zhou Rui, go and sign O&T's contract if it's appropriate.

471
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:48,920
The earlier it's signed, the faster we can get the deposit.

472
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,210
Director Wei, the thing is we still have some demands.

473
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:55,650
I think we should try for Huikang.

474
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:00,300
This type of contract is always a standard contract of party A.

475
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,420
We are only responsible for signing.

476
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:05,960
Can't you tell we'll lose money on this?

477
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,560
Of course, I can tell.

478
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,920
However, what our company needs now

479
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,360
is a receipt of real money.

480
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,930
But I've never signed anything. I've only stamped contracts.

481
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:19,200
Ye Chao Dong is right.

482
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,650
This demand must be placed first.

483
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,020
Director Wei, you both can stay and chat.

484
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,900
This chicken was delicious.

485
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:42,310
You just said "we?"

486
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:44,810
- When did it became "we?"
- That's not what I meant.

487
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:47,110
Adding demands?

488
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:49,100
Do you think you're qualified to say this?

489
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,690
No. I... I—

490
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,010
Open your email whenever it's convenient for you,

491
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:16,530
but don't be scared by it.

492
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:21,700
Compared to O&T's five year plan for the cost of technology upgrades,

493
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:25,430
these numbers shouldn't scare you.

494
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:29,100
What we need to do is spend less money than them in advance.
[Amount (in Ten Thousand Yuan)]

495
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,420
So we can strive for a better future.
[Amount (in Ten Thousand Yuan)]

496
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:36,690
Du Heng should understand the benefits of preempting market share.

497
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:38,360
Trust me!

498
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,070
Forty six million.
(TN: A bit more than $7 million US)

499
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,510
He's crazy.

500
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:02,490
♫  I always think of how it began  ♫

501
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:05,530
♫  On one summer night  ♫

502
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:09,900

00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,670

Le Le, I don't know which pair I should choose.

508

Help me pick one.

If you're going to meet some cute guys, then pick the pair on the right.

Do you know any cute ones?

515
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,690

00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:14,050
President Du changed this afternoon's meeting time to 3 o'clock.

520
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:17,080
Be prepared!

521
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,560
Preparation is never enough.

522
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,120
However, I know how to discuss it.

523
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:25,800
Let's meet 10 minutes earlier this afternoon at the coffee shop downstairs of O&T.

524
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,050
Let's touch base on it first, okay?

525
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:31,660
Okay. Got it!

526
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,810
- Hello, Master.
- Come to my office right away.

527
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:55,020
R-right now? O-okay.

528
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:08,450
Director Zhou, President Chen is in the finance room.

529
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:12,550
- Master.
- The bank just sent us an urgent letter.

530
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,540
Their attitude isn't good.

531
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:20,700
Master, I'm going to negotiate with Du Heng this afternoon.

532
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:24,140
I'm also confident that I can convince him to add 46 million to the overall share.

533
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:26,320
However, slowness can't meet hasty demand.

534
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,640
I-I've already asked them to go get the money back.

535
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,540
If you rely on them to get the money back, that won't work.

536
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,500
You need to do it yourself.

537
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:37,690
If you need to, you can use some tricks.

538
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:40,970
- I understand.
- The company needs to be paid back as soon as possible.

539
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:43,000
I understand.

540
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,180
Is this how you collect debts?

541
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,930
With a phone call, and just wait for Cao Tian You to give you the money?

542
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:52,920
If that doesn't work, then we can sue them, do it through legal means.

543
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:56,690
Don't you know how long that would take?

544
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:59,810
Brother Lei, what have you two been doing?

545
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:02,780
- W-We also call every day.
- Just calling?

546
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:05,720
Anyway, when my dad used to collect debts, it was never with a phone call.

547
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:09,000
He always had people use two vans to corner them.

548
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,950
Country Bumpkin!

549
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,740
How long does it take to get to Fast from here?

550
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,910
One hour if there's no traffic.

551
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:21,430
Five minutes to get ready! You're all coming with me to Fast.

552
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:24,670
You two, bring a portable charger so we can record everything.

553
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:27,580
- Got it!
- Director Zhou, can I stay here?

554
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,360
You need to go.

555
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:37,330
- What are you doing?
- My dad said I could get kidnap at anytime.

556
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,310
Give me that.

557
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,510
- What?
- Give it to me!

558
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,870
If anything happens... this one... weapon?

559
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:50,440
What you copy casually is different in nature.

560
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,080
Incredibly stupid!

561
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:56,190
- Director Zhou—
- Enough, enough, enough!

562
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,210
Fang Wei, tell me about your investigation results.

563
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:09,460
Cao Tian You is Fast Future Technology's founder.

564
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:12,500
He's a northerner who was born in 1978, and his highest degree is a high school diploma.

565
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:16,260
He's also served as the chairman of the private entrepreneurs association in their county.

566
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:20,670
Director Zhou, you had people from the administration department investigate this.

567
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:22,690
I don't think it's appropriate, isn't it?

568
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,510
I'm a realist.

569
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:29,820
I don't care who it is, as long as you can get the job done, you're good.

570
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:33,810
Cao Tian You is your client, so you should think about what you'll say.

571
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:35,970
Either we'll get our money back,

572
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:39,360
or we bring back our equipment.

573
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,490
I have something to do later, so I need to leave early.

574
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:46,410
If we can't agree by then, you both can continue.

575
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:48,470
Why are we going after onlyOld Cao?

576
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:50,650
We have other clients who owe us money.

577
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:52,380
I think Fast is still pretty good.

578
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,630
Old Cao owes us the most!

❝ One Half ❞ by Mo Fei Ding Lu

00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:29,320
♫ The freckles on my face are bright and dark  ♫

582
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,960
♫ Oh...  ♫

583
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:37,520
♫  Who sung the song halfway through  ♫

584
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:43,390
♫  Leaving behind the roars of the chorus in an empty room  ♫

585
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:46,410
♫ I...  ♫

586
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:53,300
♫  Slowly tidied up the embarrassment of the dispersing crowd  ♫

587
00:42:53,300 --> 00:43:01,350
♫  Who would abruptly break off the lingering care of the past?  ♫

588
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:04,040
♫  You deserved it, someone said  ♫

589
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:15,360
♫  It would be for the best that the story stays unfinished  ♫

590
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:22,140
♫  Those words were spoken halfway  ♫

591
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:26,090
♫  When those few words reached the tip of the tongue  ♫

592
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:29,560
♫  It would take several years to accept  ♫

593
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:36,200
♫  Whose heart is closed midway from now on  ♫

594
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:43,760
♫  Locking up all the past rainy nights of being restless  ♫

595
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:50,330
♫  Some words are only spoken halfway  ♫

596
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:54,350
♫  To adjust the emotional intensity afterwards  ♫

597
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:57,720
♫  Just air-dry it slowly with time  ♫

598
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:04,390
♫  Whose heart will miss a half from now on  ♫

599
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:06,570
♫  Just let it totally submerge  ♫

600
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:12,950
♫  My remaining dimness  ♫

601
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:19,180
♫  The other half  ♫

602
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,810
♫  The other half  ♫

603
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:32,660
♫  The other half  ♫
