Next, we welcome Xuntong Communications Group's President Shang Tong Qian

25

You keep an eye on things here. If it doesn't work, let the Master of Ceremonies control the scene.

33
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,340
How can I keep an eye on things?

34
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,530
Cut the crap! You have to keep an eye on it.

35
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,680
Today, we've also invited many friendly folks from several media platforms.

38
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,880
I discovered that the contract had been changed by Wang Yi Nan.

39
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,660
- Did you know about it?
- Wang Yi Nan said he would explain it to you.

40
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,680
Where is Wang Yi Nan?

41
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,580
- He's rushing over here right now.
- ...be able to prroceed smoothly.

42
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,660
You go to the signing ceremony first and keep the situation stable.

43
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,280
Okay.

44
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,770
Over-commitment is an industry-taboo.

45
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:04,080
Let us applaud and welcome the Jieke Company's Director of Sales in East China, Zhou Rui.

46
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,910
Boss, we originally promised them an upgrade for free within a year.

47
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,700
Now, it's changed to three quarters, so the customer changed only one sentence.

48
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,290
Don't you think that one sentence can kill?

49
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,850
Hasn't our R&D Department already started the internal testing?
(TN: R&D = Research and Development)

50
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,980
What if the R&D Department doesn't get through the internal testing?

51
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,280
Then the company will be at risk of breaching the contract.

52
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,820
Are you in that much of a rush to get your commission?

53
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,560
Of course, I'm in a rush.

54
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,520
Who knows if this company will still exist after today?

55
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,610
The bank also won't give us the loan.

56
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,410
There's outside talk now that Jieke's has funding problems.

57
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:00,210
Boss, this is a contract of several tens of million yuan.

58
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:04,130
Wang Yi Nan, you won't be able to get your commission.

59
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,870
For this contract, I almost became a nanny for President Shang.

60
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:12,700
Who else do we have in East China who can get the client to hold such a big signing ceremony?

61
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,360
I—

62
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,470
Boss, doesn't Chen Ming Kai need this contract even more?

63
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,750
I'll sign the contract.

64
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,120
I'll also bear the trouble afterward. But,

65
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,090
you either get fired by the company,

66
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,420
or you resign.

- Sign the contract first! We can talk later.
- It's really important.

00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,550
You're still here, so you can take care of it.

170
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:46,390
Mr. Chen is your mentor, but he still shouldn't be throwing you to the mess in the North China Region.

171
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:51,520
As mentor and mentee, we'll be in this together.

172
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,120
I can't let him jump to his death, can I?

173
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:09,030
May I please have the attention of those who are picking up passengers.

174
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:14,220
Flight 1247 is arriving at 8:14.

175
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,730
Thank you.

176
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:20,290
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention please?

177
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,490
[Beijing Jia An Building]

178
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:50,230
Is there anyone here? Is someone here?

179
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,800
Did you turn off the water?

180
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,950
I'm brushing my teeth.

181
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,980
[Company Water Shut Off Notice]
(Briefly: Due to emergency repair, there will be no water until about 12 pm)

182
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,710
One minute! I just need one minute to finish brushing my teeth.

183
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,220
Today's Monday and we have a lot of customers and employees coming in.

184
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm already fifteen minutes late. I'm sorry!

185
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,700
Thank you.

186
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,420
Hello?

187
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:03,640
Boss! We love you, Boss!

188
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,620
See what I said?

189
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,200
What did I tell you? Our boss was definitely going to go.

190
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,160
Who lost the bet? Give me your ¥100.

191
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,520
Quickly give me your money.

192
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,030
Boss, let us see what the Beijing headquarters looks like.

193
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:19,880
That's right! Show us.

194
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,750
Look! It's so luxurious.

195
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,090
What nice headquarters we have!

196
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,110
Look at that!

197
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,490
Nice to meet you, Director Zhou! I'm Xie Yi.

198
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,960
The North China Regional Sales Department welcomes you.

199
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,980
Is he... Zhou Rui?

200
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,140
Zhou Rui from the south and Luo Jia from the north are legends.

201
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,240
However, seeing him in person today, Sister, he looks better in person.

202
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,140
Two tigers can't coexist on the same mountain; a bloody scene is about to unfold.

203
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,990
It went up!

204
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,510
Master.

205
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:03,760
Did I upset you by not greeting you earlier?

206
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,580
You have to keep your distance from people you're familiar with in the workplace, I understand.

207
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,320
The sales department on the right side of the reception,

208
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,330
did you notice anything?

209
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,470
Be honest!

210
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:26,550
My honest opinion? Okay.

211
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,260
The sales team should be with their clients.

212
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,450
What use is it for them sticking to their cubicles every day?

213
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:40,330
Their desks are filled with skincare products, makeup,

214
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:43,230
snacks, soup pots, and pillows of male celebrities.

215
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,840
This... This isn't... This isn't a summer camp, is it?

216
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,960
As I walked in,

217
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,560
I heard someone speculating on the stock market while on the job.

218
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,360
- They would be fired immediately if this were the East China Region.
- You're in the North China Region now.

219
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,480
Then Master,

220
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,070
how much authority do I have here?

221
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,870
What authority?

222
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,720
The authority to make a change.

223
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,570
Don't think about that just yet!

224
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,290
Take a look at this.

225
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:17,660
They're our biggest competitor for the O&T project.

226
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,300
Huikang Company.

227
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:24,140
The sales department can go first.
[Beijing] - [Huikang Technology]

228
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,170
O&T came into the logistics industry in 2015.

229
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,790
They have big, medium, and small packages,

230
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,580
supply chain technologies, B2B, and have business across five logistic networks,

231
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,230
including everything from product sales forecasting,

232
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,690
warehousing and delivery, and transportation and distribution.

233
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,750
They have 360 super warehouses across the country.

234
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,470
Their purpose for upgrading their products is to speed up their logistics

235
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:43,720
to shorten their delivery time from 24 hours to 12 hours.

236
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,510
It's predicted that their annual revenue will increase by eighty billion.

237
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:50,320
It seems that they have high standards for their performance.

238
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:57,230
Pre-sales team, what's your proposal?

239
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:59,790
They were using foreign systems before.

240
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:02,880
However, due to the slowness in technology upgrading and troubleshooting,

241
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,300
they're now thinking of working with Huikang.

242
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,220
Director Luo, take a look.

243
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,730
Director Luo, our technology department is still testing a new system.

244
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:18,400
If it's able to pass the stability test, it should be able to satisfy the performance standards of the client.

245
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,910
I believe what the client is focused on is one thing, speed.

246
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:25,530
From the time the order is placed to the time the client receives the information,

247
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,150
to the tracking of the logistics information

248
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,720
and finally to when the customer receives the product.

249
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,760
Speed is the most important problem that O&T needs to solve.

250
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,060
Master,
[O&T Server Procurement Project Plan]

251
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:39,620
from what I know, Director Wei has been in charge of the O&T project.

252
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:43,510
The people working on this project are also part of his team.

253
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:46,080
I... can't take this on.

254
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,030
I really can't.

255
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,090
You have no choice but to take it on.

256
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,610
- Did you write the technology proposal?
- Yes.

257
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:05,110
Tell me how we can have the fastest running speed

258
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,430
amongst all of our competing companies.

259
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:12,350
It isn't difficult to increase the running speed, but the faster it is, the less secure it is.

260
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,480
We're looking for both security and speed.

261
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,620
- That's what I expect from the technology department.
- Yes. Yes.

262
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,600
We just need to satisfy the client's needs.

263
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,790
Here's the latest news.

264
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:29,980
Jieke's Zhou Rui is now taking on this project.

265
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,040
- Zhou Rui?
- Who?

266
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,830
- Is it the Zhou Rui of the south?
- I don't know.

267
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:37,250
Fired an employee of mine that's been with me for four years.

268
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,620
He was also the salesperson who completed this project.

269
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,030
Master, I don't have superhuman powers.

270
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,490
I can't just throw myself into this as there's hardly any room for me to do anything.

271
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,360
You're talking to me about having no room?

272
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,970
What do I need you for then?

273
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:53,460
Defeating Huikang is our only way out.

274
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,890
This conversation is over! You can switch out Wei Yan's team if you don't think they can do this task well.

275
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:00,550
You can get rid of anyone who's wasting the company's resources.

276
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,780
Master,

277
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,980
I thought you transferred me here from the East China Region to expand our market.

278
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,880
I'm not here to steal anyone's project or fire people.

279
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,540
If the O&T project was so important,

280
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:18,020
- you shouldn't have let Wei Yan take leave.
- Zhou Rui,

281
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:23,240
I know better than you what I should and shouldn't do.

282
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,050
We must win the O&T project.

283
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:29,540
If we win, Jieke will only be able to catch a breath.

284
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,130
If we lose,

285
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,570
the entire company and its thousands of employees go down together.

286
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:53,550
- Take a look at this!
- Okay.

287
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:56,020
I'll do this project myself.

288
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,810
You all can continue.

289
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,690
Director Luo.

290
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:18,320
Engineer Liu, people like you with a technology background,

291
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,980
is there a weakness?

292
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,430
Alright, it's nothing! I was just asking randomly.

293
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,570
Come in!

294
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,990
Hello, Director Zhou! This is your badge.

295
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,760
Thanks.

296
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,890
Let me report to you.

297
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:59,470
I'm Fan Wei from the Administration Department. Fan as in Direction, and Wei as in Dignified.

298
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,590
Not the Wei in Wei Yan.

299
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:08,510
Then, let me give you a general introduction of the people here.

300
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,220
That one is Xiao Yun. She's pretty reliable on the job.

301
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:14,320
I bought all of it because of your intel.

302
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,580
This... Do you want to kill me?

303
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:19,530
That one wearing glasses is Ye Chao Dong.

304
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,900
Whoever sent you the Intel was scamming you of your money.

305
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,410
He's Director Wei's right-hand man.

306
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:27,140
Sister Yun, how much did you buy?

307
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,250
Two thousand?

308
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,720
- That young one is called Xie Yi.
- Twenty thousand.

309
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,150
She doesn't look dependable, but she's quite clever.

310
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,910
You've gotten too much money on your hands, haven't you?

311
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,980
If I want to fire people,

312
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,640
whom do you think I should fire first?

313
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,520
Fire people...?

314
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,720
That's impossible, isn't it?

315
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,940
T-they are all pillars of the company.

316
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,880
Sister,

317
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,100
look at these two pairs of shoes!

318
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,260
You were looking for them earlier.

319
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,530
As soon as the merchandise arrived, I put them away for you.

320
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:05,450
I rushed to call you right away.

321
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:12,180
Try them on.

322
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:15,990
Xiao Le, Xiao Le.

323
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:19,630
You're so thoughtful and clever.

324
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:21,120
Don't do too much sweet talk!

325
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,200
When it's too sweet, it sounds fake.

326
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,640
Pretty good! Wrap them up for me.

327
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:42,280
Sister, that man at the door seems to have been staring at you for a while.

328
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,560
Is he someone you know?

329
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,970
He does look familiar.

330
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,470
I sent you an email, have you seen it?

331
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,550
Is it you who sent that?

332
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,750
What's the matter?

333
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,150
You absolutely must not underestimate Zhou Rui.

334
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,480
Do you think I can't get the O&T project?

335
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,400
Without Zhou Rui, you'd definitely get it.

336
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,800
With him, you might not necessarily get it.

337
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:22,530
Continue talking! How exactly will it be with him or without him?

338
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,920
I don't want to talk about it right now.

339
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,900
Do you really think I have a lot of idle time to chat with you here?

340
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,510
Unless you ask me to enter Huikang someday—

341
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:38,420
If you really think I can only defeat Zhou Rui based solely on your analysis,

342
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:41,260
then there won't be any day for you to get into Huikang.

343
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,250
This guy, Zhou Rui...

344
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:50,830
How should I phrase it?

345
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:53,560
I beat him up because he fired me.

346
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,860
If Zhou Rui has to follow principles, then he wouldn't sign the contract.

347
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:59,540
But once he has signed it, he shouldn't fire me.

348
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:02,160
President Shang is a client that I was with for many years.

349
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,970
So was it signed in the end?

350
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:06,240
Yes, it was signed.

[Zhou Rui]

352
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,810
He had to sign even if he didn't want to.

353
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:17,020
His mentor, Chen Ming Kai, is probably relying on this project to survive.

354
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,020
Congratulations!

355
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,580
Director Zhou, you can't leave just like this.

356
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,200
I'm sure everyone here wants to hear your stunning speech.

357
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,860
Isn't that right?

358
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,860
Then I'll say a few words.

359
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,220
Today is a good day.

360
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:50,870
I should say some good words or lucky words while I'm here.

362
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,950
However...

363
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,910
However, at the moment of the signing,

364
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:06,050
in a flash, I asked myself.

365
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:08,700
What are salespeople?

366
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,620
What are salespeople?

367
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,610
Are they really what you all say?

368
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:17,610
Are they just a bunch of animals without self-respect?

369
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:22,040
Are they a bunch of people who harbor suspicion, infight, lose sleep, lose hair,

370
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,270
can't drink, but have to drink to get a contract?

371
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:30,020
Are they those who think they're getting rich when they're young but are actually dying at a young age?

372
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,330
Or they really are.

373
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:46,140
I remember what my mentor told me, "It's difficult to be a person, it's also difficult to do your job."

374
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,100
I actually didn't like listening to that.

375
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,750
But at that instant,

376
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,220
I suddenly realized that

377
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,040
it's difficult to be a salesperson.

378
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,050
It's even more difficult to be a good salesperson.

379
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:02,280
It's like a problem in the Math Olympiad.

380
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:06,620
How can you achieve good sales performance,

381
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:10,060

384
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,490
is when we'll have better days.

385
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:19,910

- Who did this project proposal?
- Ye Chao Dong led us to do it.

398
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:23,330
- It was accepted before the sale.
- It was done based on Director Wei's recommendation.

399
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,990
Who's our competitor?

400
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:32,180
Huikang, is it?

401
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:35,240
Such an obsolete proposal! What are you using to compete with?

402
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:39,270
- That's settled from the Marketing Department—
- Processing ten thousand orders in an hour.

403
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:42,190
Right away, you can see it's Huikang's standard.

404
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:46,240
The client has already established a standard based on Huikang's capabilities.

405
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,170
What about us? What do we use to impress the client?

406
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:53,150
- There are many standards to impress the client—
- Previously, has anyone gotten involved with this project?

407
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,930
- No.
- No.

408
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,950
Have you visited O&T's Du Heng?

409
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,280
Do we know the client's pain points?

410
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,440
Director Wei and Brother Dong are responsible for following up with that.

411
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,240
- We don't really know much.
- That's right!

412
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,290
You don't know much.

413
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:20,190
What are you talking about then?

414
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,790
Director Zhou, when Director Wei was in charge of us,

415
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,930
we weren't allowed to visit the clients.

416
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,890
Even if we wanted to, we couldn't make contact.

417
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:30,410
- In the end, when the deal was closed, he would even share with us—
- Share some money?

418
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:33,980
A proposal that looks like this, we can't use it to win at all.

419
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:37,200
Where would the money come from? Where would the money come from?

420
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,120
Brother Dong, where are you?

421
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,870
You don't understand the client's needs,

422
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:44,150
but you still want to share in the money. You're in sales!

423
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,260
Let's stop for now!

424
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,520
I'll tell you all after I've thought this through.

425
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,560
Brothers, Director Wei has said,

426
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:00,030
even if you work overtime tonight, you must finish the O&T proposal.

427
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:03,600
- Hurry up!
- Brother Dong, Director Zhou said to stop for now.

428

- Kai Yang, quick!
- Okay.

00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:35,820
Turning off the lights when we leave is the company's rule.

510
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,800
- Hurry up and go. Be quick!
- Bye-bye.

511
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,310
- I'm leaving then. See you tomorrow! Bye bye.
- Bye bye.

512
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:46,360
If you were in East China, I would've fire you; do you know that?

513
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,650
However, we're in North China right now.

514
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:58,400
Director Luo, the win loss data has come out.

515
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,080
Our Huikang has more wins.

516
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:04,370
A lot of our wins are in the pricing and product iteration indicators.

517
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:06,510
Tell me something that I don't know!

518
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:10,860
- The key is to figure out where we lost.
- Okay.

519
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,550
Look, Director Luo!

520
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:17,790
I've listed the data here.

521
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:21,820
Where we lost was all in the technology indicators.

522
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:25,340
Moreover, Jieke's funding was relying on its leading technology a few years ago.

523
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,800
Let me ask you something.

524
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,940
Why do they lead in technology?

525
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:55,120
It's because they have Zhou Rui.

526
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:35,440
[Huikang Sales Representative]
[Luo Jia] - [Regional Director of Sales]

527
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:53,030
♫ The sun is only shining halfway  ♫

528
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:57,780
♫ The freckles on my face are bright and dark  ♫

529
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:02,390
There's Zhou Rui in the South, and Luo Jia in the North. Got it?

530
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:06,650
Are you talking about that Luo Jia of Luo Jia Time?

531
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:11,870
Right! Our company's old competitor, Huikang Company's Luo Jia.

532
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:15,140
No matter what level the client is, only when Luo Jia arrives,

533
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:18,710
that's when the meeting starts.

534
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:21,020
She can buy a plane ticket to Tokyo today,

535
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,770
and appear at a bidding meeting in Hangzhou the next day.

536

♫  Who would abruptly break off the lingering care of the past?  ♫

♫ You deserved it, someone said  ♫

538
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:36,130
She even used 350 words to make six million USD.

539
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:40,460
350 words in Russian, in an email.

540
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:44,840
Put it this way, a girl who fought her way out of a big forest is really fierce.

541
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:51,010
♫  Those words were spoken halfway  ♫

542
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:54,770
♫  When those few words reached the tip of the tongue  ♫

00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:27,700
♫  Who sung the song halfway through  ♫

548
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:33,560
♫  Leaving behind the roars of the chorus in an empty room  ♫

♫  I...  ♫

550
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:43,490
♫  Slowly tidied up the embarrassment of the dispersing crowd  ♫

♫  Whose heart is closed midway from now on  ♫

558
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:33,890
♫  Locking up all the endless insomnia in the past?  ♫

559
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:40,420
♫  Some words are only spoken halfway  ♫

560
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:44,420
♫  To adjust the emotional intensity afterwards  ♫

561
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:47,860
♫  Just air-dry it slowly with time  ♫

562
