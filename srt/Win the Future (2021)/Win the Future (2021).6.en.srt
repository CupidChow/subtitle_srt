472
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,000
There's a slight temporary problem with the capital chain.

473
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,500
Look! Just like Siemens in Germany,
(TN: An Industrial manufacturing company)

474
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,000
Coca-Cola in the States, and Toshiba in Japan.

475
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,730
They've been around for more than a hundred years already.

476
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:46,500
Each has cash flow problems, too.

477
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,090
Isn't that so?

478
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,700
Director Luo, have faith in my instincts and obsessions.

479
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:59,900
The Grandmaster calculated my horoscope and gave me four words.
 [Integrity in the World]

480
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,800
He gave me four great words.

481
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,000
"Heaven won't destroy Cao."

482
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,400
Fine! Well said.

483
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,500
I understand, too.

484
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,700
Let's do this! Find President Lin personally

485
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,400
and repeat what you just told me.

486
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:28,400
Let him decide how long we should wait. Okay?

487
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,100
Director Luo, you should give—

488
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,200
Director Luo. Director Luo! Luo—

489
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,500
Director Luo, how can you pressurize people to this extent?

490
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,200
- Why are you here?
- I'm waiting here for the opportunity.

491
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,500
This is unlike you to think up such a silly tactic.

492
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,000
How much does he owe you?

493
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,600
How much does he owe you?

494
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,590
More than 30 million yuan.

495
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,400
It's the same again.

496
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,910
We're quite fated in terms of numbers.

497
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:25,100
What's your birthday?

498
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:28,400
What? You want to calculate my horoscope?

499
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,400
How do you plan to chase and get back this payment?

500
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,400
We don't lack the money to extend our lives.

501
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,300
SoI haven't decided whether to chase him for the money.

502
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:42,000
That O&T's 46 million yuan can really extend a life.

503
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,970
I owe you a "thank you."

504
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,200
Same old place, it's my treat!

505
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,520
What are you looking at?

506
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,500
Do I look good?

507
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,400
Yes. You look good.

508
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,900
Can we change the place?

509
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,200
Text me the location! It'll be my treat.

510
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,500
Come! Let's drink.

511
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:36,980
Congratulations to you guys...

512
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,000
for joining forces with Luo Jia of Huikang

513
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,600
and forcing O&T to increase the procurement budget.

514
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,600
No.

515
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,200
Director Wei, based on what you said,

516
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:57,200
I know you're still angry.

517
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,200
Okay.

518
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,200
What's the budget increment?

519
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:13,000
Shouldn't you let me know of the advancement of this account, too?

520
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,700
I will, I will! I definitely will.

521
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:19,600
-Actually—
- Do you know why I wanted you to give way to his team?

522
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:25,450
Do you still remember what I told you about that old Hong Kong movie?

523
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:31,600
Whoever feeds you, he's the boss.

524
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:41,200
In the future, even if Zhou Rui sneezes,

525
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,000
I must be the first to know.

526
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:51,300
Why isn't my signature on the contract with Fast?

527
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,200
What Fast?

528
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,400
Cao Tianyou's Fast Company.

529
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,000
Whose connection is that? I can't remember.

530
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,560
Is there a problem?

531
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,600
All sales contracts of the company must have my signatory for review.

532
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,800
- This is the rule.
- However, rules can be changed.

533
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,400
Your collaboration with Jieke,

534
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,800
you didn't discuss with me in advance, either.

535
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,800
Then let me tell you now.

536
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,400
The collaboration of Jieke and Huikang

537
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,600
successfully added 46 million yuan to the negotiation with O&T.

538
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,990
This project won't lose money.

539
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:32,700
It calls for a big celebration.

540
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:36,000
Let's go according to your rules then.

00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:15,000
♫  Leaving behind the roars of the chorus in an empty room  ♫

♫  Slowly tidied up the embarrassment of the dispersing crowd  ♫

♫  Who would abruptly break off the lingering care of the past?  ♫

♫  You deserved it, someone said  ♫

551

♫  It would be for the best that the story stays unfinished  ♫

00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:53,800
♫  Those words were spoken halfway  ♫

553
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:57,800
♫  When those few words reached the tip of the tongue  ♫

554
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,200
♫  It would take several years to accept  ♫

♫  Whose heart is closed midway from now on  ♫

♫  To adjust the emotional intensity afterwards  ♫

559
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,400
♫  Just air-dry it slowly with time  ♫
