[Episode 28]

22
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,520
I'm so sensible!

23
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:47,900
Since you have me in your heart, there's no need for me to compete with you.

24
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:53,140
It's better that you're the one to touch my cake rather than someone else.

25
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,830
You... Are you... Are you telling me the truth?

26
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,650
Why do I feel like you are testing me?

27
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,620
You tell me, then!

28
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,010
What else can I do?

29
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,880
Every time when I wanted to stab you,

30
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,420
my heart gave in first.

31
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,560
I already think it's unprofessional of me to act like this.

32
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,040
If that's the case,

33
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,430
I might as well put my knife down.

34
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:42,040
To be honest, I should be the one to put down the knife.

35
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,000
Honestly, just that line is enough.

36
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,060
- Don't move!
- You bit me!

37
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,060
Grandma.

38
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,350
You drank?

39
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,150
- Had a fight?
- No, no.

40
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,950
We didn't fight, we didn't fight.

41
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,000
Grandma, when she comes next time,

42
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,050
can you give me a heads up?

43
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,260
This is my home, why do I have to give you a heads up?

44
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:19,060
Grandma, aren't you worried about her treating our home as hers?

45
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,470
You better remember this, okay?

46
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,910
From now on, the three of us

47
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:35,630
should say, "our home."

48
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,540
Goodnight, Goddess!

49
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,530
Why are you being suspicious?

50
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,420
Did you buy it? This doesn't count.

51
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,440
Who said I bought it? I spent the whole night there to get it.

52
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,600
If you don't believe me, ask the shop owner.

53
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,130
- How about your promise to me then?
- I'm in a rush to get to work.

54
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,630
I don't have time to play with you .

55
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:20,440
Bei Yao Yao, the biggest taboo in sales is not keeping a promise.

56
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,320
What did I promise you?

57
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,070
Have you really been bullied before?

58
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,170
Just kidding.

59
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:38,240
- Bei Yao Yao, of everything you said, which one is actually true?
- Guess!

60
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,520
I guess it's all fake! You look more like someone who bullies others.

61
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,710
Have I bullied you before?

62
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,530
Not really.

63
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,500
My mom called me last night.

64
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,940
She asked how we are getting along.

65
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,680
I said it's fantastic.

66
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,810
Is your mom there for you to lie to?

67
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,910
Isn't your mom the same as well?

68
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,070
Once I get my pay check, I'll immediately pay my rent.

69
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,990
Bei Yao Yao.

70
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,980
Isn't there one bit of me that you like?

71
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,330
- That evening, you even—
- Hold on!

72
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:22,460
Cui Long, of everything you said, which one is actually true?

73
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,850
You firmly told me that nothing happened that night.

74
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,890
Other than us playing video games, we have nothing in common.

75
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,520
It can be cultivated! This... this...

76
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,380
Relationships can be cultivated!

77
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,460
- You know that our relationship needs to be nurtured.
- Okay, okay.

78
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,880
Don't follow me! I am taking the subway.

79
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,210
- I just want to follow you.
- Why?

80
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,240
I'm afraid you might bully someone else.

81
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,700
[President Chen.]

82
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,240
- Director Zhou.
- Master.

83
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,460
Master, did you sleep well?

84
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,060
Not bad.

85
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:13,150
Feng Wei, you have quite a lot saved on your phone.

86
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,470
It's okay. I just blindly saved them.

87
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,370
Master, I want to report to you on something.

88
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,280
Let Fang Wei report it.

89
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,920
Once you're done, then report back to me.

90
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,220
It looks like you've already finished handling it?

91
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,000
Do you still want to battle?

92
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,240
I-I'll follow your direction.

93
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,150
President Chen, you're back.

94
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,770
I'm back.

95
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:46,170
- President Chen, if you have time, I want to report something.
- Go ahead!

96
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,410
- Can I talk to you alone?
- Why?

97
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:52,420
Is it that Zhou Rui or Feng Wei who can't listen in on it?

98
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,070
There is nothing they can't hear about.

99
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:58,250
After Director Zhou proposed a one penny bidding price, there's a client who wants to revise their contract with us.

100
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,370
There are many in sales who lost their orders because of this and want an explanation from the company.

101
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:04,730
- I'm afraid this will get messy—
- Director Wei, to be honest,

102
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,800
as long as you heart stays calm, it still won't turn messy.

103
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,220
You completely understand what this order means for the future.

104
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,910
It's just you who isn't willing to change.

105
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,480
Director Zhou, our existing clients want compensation.

106
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,670
New clients don't even dare to enter our doors.

107
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:20,230
Everyone has people they need to feed, why must we ruin their livelihoods?

108
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:23,460
The traditional sales model can no longer satisfy the needs of big corporations.

109
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,560
That's why our company is developing this cloud platform at this time.

110
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,780
- This is the only way to broaden our sources of income—
- Because of that phrase, our company has to spend so much money.

111
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:34,830
The company's future can only go as far as your vision can go.

112
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:42,170
President Chen, those companies who just signed the contract with us called earlier today.

113
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,920
They said we are liars, and must change it to one penny.

114
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,770
Please tell me how I'm supposed to communicate with these clients?

115
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,320
We don't care how much your quote was, nor do we dare to care.

116
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,680
But because of you, Zhou Rui, we collectively lost our clients.

117
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,990
The company must give us an explanation.

118
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:57,900
That's right! There is a key performance indicator system for us, but there are people who break the rules.

119
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,520
- How can we work like this?
- I believe everyone can still remember

120
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,620
how many people lost their jobs because of the invention of the first computer.

121
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,360
Times have changed.

122
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,050
That's why it's normal for cloud computing to impact the future of businesses.

123
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:13,360
Impact? Zhou Rui, do you work for our competitors?

124
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,370
That's right! You're even stealing your own people's pie.

125
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,380
- All right.
- That's right!

126
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,280
- You went overboard, Zhou Rui.
- He went overboard.

127
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,230
When the company encounters a difficulty,

128
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:24,090
no matter who caused it, you need to think of a solution first.

129
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,370
Does it make sense to come make a fuss to President Chen on anything?

130
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:29,030
Director Wei, the fact that the clients haven't fought their way here yet,

131
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,970
is because we're doing our best to keep them at bay.

132
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:34,160
You can't make a horse run without feeding the horse, can you?

133
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,820
Jieke and Fast's collaboration

134
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,330
was indeed approved by me.

135
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:41,810
However, quoting this kind of price,

136
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:44,590
it's Zhou Rui executing first before reporting.

137
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:50,850
You took the company's salaries to achieve your own goals.

138
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,500
Do you think you can convince the people here?

139
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,140
From this day on,

140
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:02,050
the revenue from Zhou Rui's sales department will be completely used to compensate every teams' losses.

141
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:06,250
Furthermore, your team's Cui Long must be harshly punished.

142
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,880
You can't continue without a proper explanation.

143
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,390
- Does anyone have problems with that?
- N-No.

144
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,440
If there are no issues with it, then you're dismissed.

145
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,230
Disperse, disperse!

146
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:34,300
- I can only help you to this point.
- I understand.

147
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:38,210
If you apply for more funding for cloud computing,

148
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,470
I definitely won't approve.

149
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,770
Okay, I got it.

150
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:13,420
Zhou Rui, you aren't changing your d*mn mind, are you?

151
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,770
Right. I'm doing cloud computing for sure!

152
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:19,710
Okay. The company will also be doomed for sure then.

153
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,030
Rather than being castrated,

154
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,580
isn't it better to die happily?

155
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,920
Zhou Rui, speaking of selfishness,

156
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,310
I'm far behind from you.

Okay. Send me your scale and materials.

318
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,780
No, Old Lei!

319
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,140
You really can't let them wield their temper.

320
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,820
This could make big trouble.

321
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:00,480
Bei Yao Yao, you should put aside the press conference for now.

322
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,630
You're responsible for Cui Long.

323
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:05,500
How am I responsible?

324
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,400
Just tell him that we cannot all

325
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,680
hang to die on the same tree.

326
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,450
Don't persuade me! I'm not going to Wei Yan's team.

327
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,170
Why are you so resistant?

328
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:25,270
One can be killed but not humiliated.

329
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:28,030
Zhou Rui knows that Wei Yan has always been our enemy.

330
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,660
He's transferring me over there now.

331
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,130
Isn't it to let Wei Yan kill me?

332
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,970
Transferring you to Wei Yan's team is to save you.

333
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:42,830
Besides, you're a wealthy heir and have a lot of good resources.

334
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,760
- Zhou Rei understands Wei Yan really well.
- Stop saying "wealthy heir, wealthy heir!"

335
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,230
I just want to be on a team with you.

336
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:11,670
Why do you work?

337
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:13,500
I don't want to work.

338
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:18,750
My mom and dad originally forced me here.

339
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,990
Do you know how hard it is to find a job?

340
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,940
Have you ever been hurt by someone?

341
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,220
Have you ever submitted a resume before?

342
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,250
Have you ever been rejected before?

343
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:39,110
Have you ever been cheated on before?

344
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:43,270
Why aren't you content?

345
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:47,190
You know it's difficult, then why did you still resign from your position in East China Region?

346
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:50,060
You don't even get wages coming to Beijing.

347
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:54,120
If I were you, I wouldn't tolerate this frustration.

348
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,520
It's because I know that I can only have a future by following Zhou Rui.

349
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,890
Ye Chao Dong doesn't have this capability.

350
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,810
What is your future like?

351
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,810
Like Luo Jia's.

352
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,380
I want to become

353
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:20,590
like Zhou Rui.

354
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,510
But I can't learn real skills from Wei Yan.

355
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:33,400
Not necessarily.

356
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,180
The Wei Yan you see is too one-sided.

357
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,110
Then am I seeing you one-sidedly?

358
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:59,490
Smile again! Let me see.

359
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:46,810
Sorry! Daddy is late.

360
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:50,350
Daddy, I'm scared.

361
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:53,460
Don't be scared! Don't be scared!

362
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,590
Is the check-up finished?

363
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:05,180
If you don't come, Duo Duo won't go anywhere.

364
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,990
Didn't you want to do this check-up?

365
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,770
Where were you then?

366
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:15,700
I called you all morning.

367
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,320
Were you that busy?

368
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,670
Then did you do the consultation? What did the doctor say?

369
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:23,410
The check-up wasn't done, what consultation?

370
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,790
I've decided not to treat Duo Duo's illness.

371
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:39,480
Anyway, I don't agree for her to get the Cochlear implant.

372
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,000
Even if she can never hear her whole life, I'll accept it.

373
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,460
Still want it?

374
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,310
Go and get back to your work.

375
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:50,480
This family doesn't need you anymore.

376
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:53,320
Duo Duo, we're going home.

377
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:02,400
Don't force me anymore!

378
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:16,170
I don't live like a human or even as a ghost now,

379
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:18,910
even worse than a dog.

380
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:40,200
Daddy was swatting a mosquito.

381
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:05,760
Do you think you're the only one living like a dog in this whole world?

382
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,140
Look at me!

383
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:11,010
Do you think I look human now?

384
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,980
Don't get crazy in front of the kid from now on!

385
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,900
She understands everything.

386
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:24,610
♪  I'm the best looking boy on this street  ♪

387
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:50,130
Dr. Su, I'm so sorry.

388
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:52,340
It was my fault today that I delayed the consultation.

389
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:56,360
Can you reschedule for another time to examine my Duo Duo?

390
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,430
I've discussed this with your wife, she still hesitates about it.

391
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:02,890
I think you guys should go back to discuss it again before coming here.

392
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:05,940
No need to discuss it! I'll make the decision on this.

393
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:10,940
Ok, then. I'll see if I can schedule a check-up for her next week.

394
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,150
- Thank you, thank you!
- The child is still young.

395
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:17,910
The sooner we arrange for the implant, the quicker she'll be able to master her language skills.

396
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,730
Compared to the side effects,

397
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:23,190
letting the child regain her hearing and integrating her into society as soon as possible,

398
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:26,380
- this is the result that both the parents and the child want, correct?
- Yes, that's right.

399
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:30,240
- I still have other patients to see to; I'll go now.
- Go ahead.

400
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:34,180
I don't really ask for anything else.

401
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:37,070
I just want to hear her call me "Dad."

402
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,400
President Du!

403
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,430
Look at this! This is our Jieke's

404
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:52,320
information prepared for the cloud computing press conference.

405
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,500
It's best if you can give comments about it.

406
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,880
If you have time, we hope that you can attend and give some guidance.

407
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,600
Zhou Rui told you to come?

408
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,750
Yes, he really needs your support.

409
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:05,710
You just won our bid and you still want me to help him by standing up on stage.

410
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:09,290
- Your Director Zhou is very greedy.
- President Du—

411
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:13,260
Does he know that Huikang also has a press conference tomorrow?

412
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,580
Director Luo also invited me.

413
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:19,830
Then are you going?

414
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:22,590
Do I need to answer your question?

415
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,140
Don't be like that, President Du.

416
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,850
Look! We just started working together.

417
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:31,010
- And now you and Huikang—
- Have you invited Director Luo for your press conference?

418
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:32,910
No.

419
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:34,610
We didn't invite her.

420
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:36,930
Why not?

421
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:40,890
Because she won't come even if we invited her.

422
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:42,460
Am I right?

423
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:46,940
You haven't been in sales that long, have you?

424
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:51,110
President Du, what do you mean by that?

425
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,940
Nothing.

426
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:58,250
- President Du.
- You'll understand it once you've worked in this industry long enough.

427
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,050
Come back for dinner.

428
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,350
You aren't slicing it correctly! Slide beef perpendicular to the grain and slice pork parallel to the grain.

429
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:59,800
- Here, here. Let me do it. Move aside, I'll do it.
- What beef or pork?

430
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,880
Still let me do it. Go on! I'll do it.

431
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:08,830
All you youngsters don't like cooking nowadays.

432
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:11,330
All you know how to do is order take-out.

433
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,580
It's actually not that hard to cook.

434
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:16,950
You guys just don't have the heart to learn it.

435
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:21,050
Where do we find time to cook? If we do, we might as well spend time on our phones.

436
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:25,210
Yeah, you youngsters indeed have a lot of pressure nowadays.

437
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:26,730
[Buildings 5-8, 11, 12]
[Buildings 3, 4]

438
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:52,060
I think society nowadays is becoming more and more unfair towards women.

439
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,330
Not only do they're asked to be able to earn money,

440
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:58,410
but they also need to give birth and take care of the child.

441
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:02,780
Not only that, once work affects the family,

442
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,850
they'll be blamed by everyone if they don't handle it well.

443
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:09,140
What if the family life is affecting work? They can easily get fired.

444
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:14,030
Jia Jia, that's why I support you.

445
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:18,220
A woman should live the way she wants to.

446
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:21,560
You mustn't care about what others think.

447
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:26,500
Then how do you know what kind of life you want?

448
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,610
Then...

449
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:32,480
you'll have to see whether work or family

450
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,740
is more important to you.

451
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:40,700
Ungrateful Child, when did you come back?

452
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,610
Director Luo, are you personally preparing a dark cuisine?

453
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,750
There is no cuisine, but only "dark" is left.

454
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:54,590
Luckily, I have you in my "dark".

455
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:56,720
All right. Don't talk gibberish.

456
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,420
You're lucky if you can put food in your mouth.

457
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:44,420
Our company is hosting a press conference tomorrow.

458
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,360
You know what the purpose is about.

459
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:50,750
What a coincidence! I'm also hosting a press conference tomorrow.

460
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:56,200
I recommend that you don't host it.

461
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,190
There won't be a single reporter attending.

462
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,680
You can't fight with Lin Zhen Wei.

463
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,460
Promotional brochures have already been sent out.

464
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:06,480
Retreating right before a battle isn't my style.

465
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,440
Why don't you ever listen when I give you advice out of the kindness of my heart?

466
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,600
When no one shows up at the venue, it'll be embarrassing.

467
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:36,680
But I have no choice, either.

468
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,280
My company isn't supporting me, either.

469
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,110
Right now, Feng Wei is the only person

470
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:42,680
helping me prepare everything.

471
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,110
Then go with your Feng Wei.

472
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:53,260
What are you doing?

473
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:59,980
Food is ready. Time to eat!

474
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:15,160
Eating a home-cooked meal is like taking poison.

475
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:22,040
Not eating? I'll have it myself.

❝ One Half ❞ by Mo Fei Ding Lu

477
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:42,030
♫ The sun is only shining halfway  ♫

478
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:47,720
♫ The freckles on my face are bright and dark  ♫

479
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,090
♫  Oh...  ♫

480
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:56,060
♫  Who sung the song halfway through  ♫

481
00:42:56,060 --> 00:43:01,850
♫  Leaving behind the roars of the chorus in an empty room  ♫

482
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:04,830
♫  I...  ♫

483
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:11,780
♫  Slowly tidied up the embarrassment of the dispersing crowd  ♫

484
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:19,920
♫  Who would abruptly break off the lingering care of the past?  ♫

485
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,530
♫  You deserved it, someone said  ♫

486
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:33,960
♫  It would be for the best that the story stays unfinished  ♫

487
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:40,690
♫  Those words were spoken halfway  ♫

488
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:44,570
♫  When those few words reached the tip of the tongue  ♫

489
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:48,070
♫  It would take several years to accept  ♫

490
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:54,810
♫  Whose heart is closed midway from now on  ♫

491
00:43:54,810 --> 00:44:02,250
♫  Locking up all the endless insomnia in the past?  ♫

492
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:08,870
♫  Some words are only spoken halfway  ♫

493
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:12,750
♫  To adjust the emotional intensity afterwards  ♫

494
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:16,460
♫  Just air-dry it slowly with time  ♫

495
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:22,970
♫  Whose heart will miss a half from now on  ♫

496
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:24,750
♫  Just let it totally submerge  ♫

497
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:32,110
♫  My remaining dimness  ♫

498
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:36,650
♫  The other half  ♫

499
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:42,920
♫  The other half  ♫

500
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:50,830
♫  The other half  ♫
