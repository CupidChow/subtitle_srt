The clauses in the contract have some issues.

The legal representative of the headquarter isn't very familiar with the business in East China.

161
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,480
Am I the one trying to involve him?

162
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,140
It's your revenue that's trying to involve him.

163
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,060
Stop fighting!

164
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,030
This meeting is over.

165
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,330
Yang Lu, go back.

166
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:38,300
Wait for the notice from the company.

167
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,480
President Lin.

168
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,260
Look at this!

169
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:22,590
This is the client whose order was withheld by Jieke's Yang Lu.

170
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,230
Right now, they need urgent follow-up.

171
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,920
Where did you get this?

172
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,560
I told you, did you forget?

173
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,010
Wang Yi Nan sent this to me as a gift.

174
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,620
- I understand.
- So that's why Wang Yi Nan is very important.

175
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,240
At least, for now.

176
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,440
You still need his help to take over these orders.

177
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,890
Do we need to follow up with all of them?

178
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,910
Yes.

179
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,770
All of them.

180
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:54,270
I initially just wanted a leg from Jieke.

181
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:57,530
Chen Ming Kai couldn't take a hint.

182
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,430
So the only way to do is that I have to take his life.

183
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,560
You got any problems?

184
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,010
- No problem.
- Good.

185
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,520
Performing the sword dance as a cover for the attempt to kill, have you noticed?

186
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,030
The sword was pointed at me.

187
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:26,860
- The person he wanted to hurt was you.
- We have to make sure Yang Lu is all right.

188
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,360
So that her clients don't end up in Wei Yan's hands.

189
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,620
We have to make sure she's all right even if we have to break the company's rules.

190
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,410
I understand.

191
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:37,580
East China is where a big part of Jieke's revenue comes from.

192
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,060
Yang Lu was being too kind.

193
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,720
She hurt the company a lot.

194
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,530
It was my fault.

195
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:46,230
- If it was too much, there must be something wrong with it.
- I thought it through.

196
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,770
- Did you hear me?
- I did.

197
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:53,390
You said Yang Lu hurt the East China branch and the entire company.

198
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,050
- What did you think about?
- This way, please.

199
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,390
All right.

200
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:05,990
Did you forget? Never mind then.

201
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,020
- Sister!
- Yinan.

202
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,000
You're finally here!

203
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You didn't change at all.

204
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,690
- You're still so young.
- Who said that?

205
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:15,970
- Give me a hug!
- Hug what?

206
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,700
Hug!

207
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,320
- Look at you!
- Jesus!

208
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,520
Be careful! Be careful!

209
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,040
- Here, here! Let me take your purse.
- Really!

210
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,020
- Let's go.
- This job you changed to was such a smart move.

211
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,650
Everyone knows about Jieke's situation now.

212
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:35,910
Your Huikang is doing so well now.

213
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,830
Sister, I had no choice.

214
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,110
I'm so used to working in sales; I can't do anything else.

215
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,680
- Cappucino?
- I'm used to it, too. I can't drink anything else.

216
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,020
I remember it so well.

217
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,860
Here you go, Sister!

218
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,650
Tell me!

219
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,560
How did you find me?

220
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,470
I knew you were transferred to the Beijing branch.

221
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,900
So I came to catch up with you.

222
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:13,730
Sister, is everyone in your family doing well?

223
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,610
Don't mention it!

224
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:19,170
Such a big Beijing! It's so hard to find a school.

225
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:21,160
It's just my habit to think back and forth.

226
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,870
My children going to school has become such a problem for me.

227
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,890
Going to school.

228
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:35,490
Sister, I can't guarantee it, but I can try.

229
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:38,510
I know someone working in education in Beijing.

230
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,400
Really?

231
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,640
I would be embarrassed to ask if it was someone else.

232
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,310
So I'll have to rely on you for this.

233
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,090
This is my pleasure.

234
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:50,550
Who doesn't have a problem they can't solve?

235
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,830
Oh right! I want to ask you something.

236
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,100
Back in Hangzhou, with that Yang...

237
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,030
- Yang Lu?
- Right! The former boss at your company.

238
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:09,670
I was negotiating a contract with her.

239
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,690
Everything was going so well.

240
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:15,970
Recently, she just left me hanging.

241
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,540
I found it so strange.

242
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,240
Let me ask you! The sales reps at Jieke...

243
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,140
have they always had that attitude?

244
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:27,700
Director Cai, are you talking about that batch of devices that are waiting to be launched online?

245
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,550
Yes.

246
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:32,160
My Sister,

247
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,730
I've done my homework.

248
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:38,600
I know that you've brought this project to Beijing.

249
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,250
I'll be straightforward with you, Sister.

250
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:47,020
For this order, maybe give it to us, Huikang?

251
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:53,540
You're working against your former company so fast?

252
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,920
You don't want to avoid it?

253
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,330
Then don't I have to work for my new company's interest?

254
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,380
Just think! I'm just a sales rep.

255
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,400
The client is my God.

256
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,030
Am I right?

257
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,970
Fine!

258
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:14,100
You got to bring out the solution first.

259
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,840
The key issue is...

260
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,230
you know what I mean.

261
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,890
I understand.

262
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:27,220
- Do you want to order anything else, Sister?
- I'm good.

263
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,680
All right, I'm taking off.

264
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,290
You are always in a rush.

265
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,690
Yang Lu,

266
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,690
let me tell you something.

267
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,460
Thanks.

268
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,730
What's wrong?

269
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,690
Tissue, tissue, tissue, tissue.

270
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,410
- Tissue, tissue, medicine, medicine.
- Medicine? Where's the medicine?

271
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,290
In the bag.

272
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,630
How do you open this bag?

273
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,420
How do you open it?

274
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,500
Give it... Give it... Give it to me!

275
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,790
Are you better now?

276
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:23,010
It's okay now. Sit!

277
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,490
I'm sorry.

278
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,480
- What's the matter?
- It's fine. Let me put some make-up on.

279
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,070
Saihanba's wild flowers are fine.
(Saihanba National Forest Park)

280
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:52,740
Are Beijing's fresh flowers poisonous?

281
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:58,290
Saihanba is a warm and tender place.

282
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:36,510
Oh yes! What's the matter with Yang Lu?

283
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:42,350
Are you sure we want to chat about that?

284
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,880
What should we chat about then?

285
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:52,200
Then... let's chat about Wang Yi Nan.

286
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,950
Du Heng is transferred.

287
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,060
Due to the system malfunctioning incident,

288
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,570
he bore the ultimate responsibility.

289
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,990
Where was he transferred to?

290
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:24,260
He went to Sichuan's Big and Small Liangshan,

291
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,880
at the installation base station.

292
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:32,330
I never heard one word of complaint from him.

293
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:37,960
I really admire him.

294
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,260
I'm hungry, so I'll eat first then.

295
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,700
Eat!

296
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:51,240
No meat.

297
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:55,180
It's healthy.

298
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:02,120
This really isn't as good as your mom's dumplings.

299
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,060
It's even not as fragrant as the Cat Ear Noodles.
(TN: Chinese noodles that are shaped like cat ears.)

300
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:12,550
I'll tell you the truth.

301
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:15,520
I'm still a bit in a daze now.

302
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:20,160
Saihanba feels like a dream.

303
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,020
I muddle-headedly took you.

304
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:28,000
I openly, clearly took you.

305
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,020
Thanks.

306
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,990
Do you know why I wanted to run away from Beijing?

307
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:55,020
O&T?

308
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:58,580
- It's because of you.
- Me?

309
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,870
Okay. I'll speak honestly.

310
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,890
I told Xiao Le where I was going.

311
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:06,750
I was thinking, just in case you were looking for me;

312
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,850
also that photo of the IV bottle.

313
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:12,720
I'm a scheming woman, am I not?

314
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:24,160
Do you know why I was going to Saihanba then?

315
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,710
Tell me!

316
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:28,480
I wanted to say thanks to you in person.

317
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,040
I don't remember you said that.

318
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,360
Is it too late now?

319
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,720
It's too late.

320
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:59,450
This is the second glass! Is this how you usually drink?

321
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:02,400

00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,000
She is very clear about her intentions and always wants kickbacks.

483
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,590
Can we give her that?

484
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,280
The company has rules about that.

485
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,090
It's a matter of principles.

486
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:04,720
The company's rules have never posed an obstacle for signing deals.

487
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,010
If you sign the deal, it's your performance.

488
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:09,210
If you don't, that's called a trap.

489
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:15,020
Can I try?

490
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:19,640
It's about time someone else takes over at this junction of the project.

491
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,450
You haven't dealt with the due payment issue yet.

492
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:24,120
Now, there's another hot potato.

493
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:36,800
With your attitudes,

494
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,450
you deserve to have the worst performance.

495
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:51,200
How is it on your side? Is it going smoothly?

496
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,890
Yes. It's going smoothly.

497
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:54,690
I won't reveal any details.

498
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:57,270
I'll give you all a surprise then.

499
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:01,460
I cannot give you all a surprise.

500
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:05,000
As long as nobody trips me on my way,

501
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,350
I'll consider myself lucky.

502
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:26,380
Master, did you want to see me?

503
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:33,400
Yang Lu is resigning.

504
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,230
What do you think?

505
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:38,650
Just follow the company's protocol.

506
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:48,260
Let's not make this a big deal.

507
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:51,940
As long as Yang Lu keeps progressing the deals that were being withheld,

508
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:54,370
she can stay with the East China branch.

509
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:57,950
The deals she left behind probably won't progress as usual.

510
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,020
President Chen.

511
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:13,000
Were you the one who trained Yang Lu?

512
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:17,640
Her performance with East China has always been excellent.

513
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:23,320
Now that she is gone, there's no one even in charge of East China at this point.

514
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:29,360
On the other hand, fighting a stupid war requires less intelligent generals.

515
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,690
Long-time staff have their flaws.

516
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:35,650
However, they're the ones who are able to handle stuff when they come.

517
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:38,360
What's worse is that she's too emotional.

518
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,350
No matter what her intention is,

519
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:43,570
this position isn't suitable for her.

520
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:49,390
I'm still letting my emotions control me.

521
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:51,640
Take Old Lei for example.

522
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,110
I felt he shouldn't work in sales a long time ago.

523
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:57,250
I've always wanted to move him to a different position.

524
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:04,090
If I can hold on for one more day, that's what I'll do.

525
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:06,750
It sucks if you can't work.

526
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,180
Old Lei and Yang Lu's situations are totally different.

527
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,750
In such an important position like East China,

528
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:15,420
if she couldn't achieve anything, that's her fault.

529
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:18,190
So, you insist that she needs to leave?
