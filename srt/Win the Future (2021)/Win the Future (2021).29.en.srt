21
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,270
It's already so late, where are you going?

22
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,750
- I'm going home.
- Enough now. Don't sulk anymore!

23
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,490
Fang Wei will be here soon.

24
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,910
Wait for 30 minutes, and then we can go for dinner. Okay?

25
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,960
- Just dine with Fang Wei.
- Let's eat together!

26
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,230
Are you jealous of Fang Wei?

27
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,290
No, Zhou Rui. Am I jealous?

28
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,940
- That's just in your brain! You still won the sale champion, didn't you?
- Luo Jia.

29
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,210
- Don't pull me!
- Stop spraying!

30
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,340
Who are you?

31
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,230
Come out!

32
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,720
Who? Who? Who is it?

33
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,070
What is this?

34
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,460
Who is it? If you dare, then come out.

35
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,610
Zhou Rui, are you done playing?

36
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,780
What is Zhou Rui doing to you?

37
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,860
President Du, I'm sorry!

38
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,510
I... didn't know it was you.

39
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,530
Actually, I wanted to lobby for Zhou Rui

40
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:46,450
to invite you to his press conference.

41
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,620
I'm not going, are you going?

42
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,650
Shouldn't you be at Huikang's press conference?

43
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,840
Are you and Zhou Rui okay?

44
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,530
Just competitors.

45
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:01,190
Besides that, what else is there?

46
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,840
I just saw Wang Yi Nan downstairs screaming and hollering.

47
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,810
It seems someone sprayed him with a fire extinguisher.

48
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:16,730
Fine! Then see you at the press conference.

49
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,440
Everyone remembers how you looked when you were the queen of sales.

50
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,940
Only I remember how you look like when you're changing bedsheets.

51
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,730
Do you regret it?

52
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:02,230
You... Do you think I gave it up because of you?

53
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:06,500
I did choose you, but I did that

54
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,980
is all because of myself.

55
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,280
I never think you owe me anything

56
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,030
nor do I think I'm the best.

57
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,170
Do you think you won or lost?

58
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,790
What does that have to do with me?

59
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,990
Lose, it's you; win, it's also you.

60
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,020
It has nothing to do with me anyway.

61
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,080
I think the best thing in this world is

62
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,460
that before seeing the result, you'll never know

63
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,050
if you'll regret the choice.

64
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,510
How about you? What do you want?

65
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,720
Happiness, or victory?

66
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,030
Did Zhou Rui come to you?

67
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:54,880
Even if he did, it still wasn't because of me.

68
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,200
He'll only look for me because of you.

69
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,890
There's only so much water in the pool.

70
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,960
If it leaks, it'll have less.

71
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:18,310
People keep using water, the faucet stays on.

72
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,870
"Cloud computing. Cloud computing." They keep shouting cloud computing every day.

73
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,110
Can cloud computing make water?

74
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,540
What happens when the pool is empty?

75
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,530
There are so many people in the company.

76
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,990
What do they eat and drink?

77
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,500
I only have two faucets in front of me.

78
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,080
One is good and the other is bad.

79
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,680
Cloud computing is the bad one.

80
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,740
Tell me, which one should I turn on?

81
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,740
I remember you told me that

82
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,410
the important choice for the company isn't related to money.

83
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,380
You tell me! Which faucet should you turn on now?

84
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,900
Neither are important.

85
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,260
The water is what is important.

86
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,950
Zhou Rui shouts about cloud computing

87
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,210
as if it's the best thing.

88
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,520
Can it fill the pool?

89
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,700
You're getting old.

90
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,750
You're really old.

91
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,170
Ten years ago, Jieke dared not lose you, Chen Ming Kai.

92
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:25,260
Ten years later, it's you, Chen Ming Kai, who currently can't leave Jieke.

93
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,390
But only old people,

94
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,800
think about responsibility

95
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,200
and think about what could happen in the future.

96
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,360
Young people never consider how other people feel.

97
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,230
They only think of themselves and the present.

98
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,910
The youth are the future.

99
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:43,340
Tell Zhou Rui then, make him totally drop the idea.

100
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,420
I initially transferred him to Beijing, so he could give me a new life.

101
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,440
not for him to deliver me directly to a funeral home.

102
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,190
He wants to scramble for power.

103
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,240
It's still too early.

104
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,150
Then I also have a question that I'm curious about.

105
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,340
In the past ten years, whom did I give a new life to?

106
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,990
Fang Wei!

107
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,870
You're back?

108
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,710
Y-You can eat first.

109
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,570
- I-I'm going back to lie down for a while.
- Grandma, you haven't finished eating.

110
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,850
I'm old; I can't sleep if I eat too much.

111
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,610
You'll be talking about work, so I won't understand.

112
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,270
It'll be so boring.

113
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,490
I'm going to rest for a while.

114
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,860
Go to have your dinner! Go to dine!

115
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,970
Director Zhou, I went to see President Du.

116
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,410
Do you know what he says?

117
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,030
- President Du said tomorrow—
- I know!

118
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,720
What if then?

119
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,110
I'm saying what if.

120
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:16,910
Tomorrow, all the reporters go to Huikang, what will we do?

121
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,490
We'll do what we should do.

122
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,780
Reporters aren't our clients.

123
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,490
There's something else to report.

124
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:34,950
I saw Wang Yi Nan in the underground garage.

125
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,340
Garage?

126
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,610
What was he doing in the garage?

127
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,820
He was holding his phone as if he was taking photos.

128
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,350
However, I didn't let him take the photos.

129
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,000
Want some?

130
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,660
It's raw.

131
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,240
Look!

132
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,540
This one...

133
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,560
Wait! What can this tell us?

134
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,060
It means that the two of them live in the same residential area.

135
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,620
I saw them pulling and pushing each other in the garage.

136
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,460
Where is the video?

137
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,360
I didn't get the chance to record it.

138
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,540
Do you know the value of a verbal statement without any proof?

139
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,050
President Lin, give me a few more days.

140
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:02,660
Maybe you need to have your eyes checked up in the hospital.

141
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,670
They are so bloody red.

142
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,690
How can you meet the customers?

143
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:10,600
People who don't know you would think you got an eye infection.

144
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:15,600
President Lin, after the press conference, I'll go to the hospital.

145
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,740
You don't need to go to the press conference.

146
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,130
President Lin.

147
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,830
Do I look good?

148
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,050
Slow down! Wait for me.

149
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,670
I'm fine.

150
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,610
There are so many people here today.

151
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,170
Let's wait a little!

152
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,560
No, I don't have time.

153
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,520
I'm so sorry, Sir!

154
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,480
May I cut the line? I need to get back to work.

155
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,920
I'm sorry, I'm in a rush as well.

156
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,590
Ask someone else.

157
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,660
Hello, Sir! Could you do me a favor?

158
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,390
My wife is here to do OB-GYN, but we're in a rush.
(TN: OB stands for obstetrician and GYN stands for gynecologist.)

159
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,230
Could we cut the line?

160
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,640
Forget it! There's no time.

161
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,190

aren't suitable for cloud services.

323
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,490
As for which enterprises aren't suitable for the cloud

324
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:29,530
and which enterprises should continue to adhere to traditional server procurement,

325
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:32,510
let's welcome Luo Jia, Director Luo,

326
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:35,330
to share and discuss with us.

327
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,990
Great!

328
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,590
Director Luo.

329
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,000
Director Luo?

330
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,230
Is Director Luo here?

331
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,310
- She was just here.
- Yeah, look for her.

332
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,020
I just saw her, too.

333
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,890
- Look for her.
- No way.

334
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,830
- She didn't leave, did she?
- She shouldn't have.

335
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:55,920
What we're facing is a four-trillion-yuan market.

336
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,480
Four trillion?

337
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:02,060
Zhou Rui, what you said was great.

338
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:05,340
But how can I trust that you aren't a liar?

339
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:09,860
How would you know whether I'm a liar or not if you don't give it a try?

340
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,640
Do you know what our pain point is?

341
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,570
What's your pain point?

342
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:16,900
Startups like ours have very little capital.

343
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,240
Lack of funds. Okay! What else?

344
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,320
For example, everyday, I receive a statement from the finance department, my heart bleeds after seeing it.

345
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,180
- I feel like I won't survive.
- Yeah.

346
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:28,470
I recall you said the first year is free, then... then what about the second year?

347
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:31,980
We feel that it's like raising a fish or a pig.

348
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,290
- Slaughter it after fattening it up.
- Right.

349
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:38,540
In addition, after we're slaughtered, then our data can be sold

350
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,100
to those internet companies to make a profit.

351
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,610
- Am I right?
- Yeah.

352
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:46,400
- Okay! What else?
- Zhou Rui.

353
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,470
All this talk is useless.

354
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,140
I only brought a cent.

355
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,590
Dare you to sign a contract with me?

356
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,130
I have to understand what kind of business you run.

357
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:04,180
Then make a plan based on your needs.

358
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:07,500
See? He's still talking about a pie in the sky.

359
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,590
Saying that means nothing.

360
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:13,650
All right, all right! Everyone, ask yourselves why you came here.

361
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,680
- We need money.
- We want to start a business.

362
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,750
- We want to get a deal.
- That's right.

363
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,680
You're here because you need money

364
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,560
because you want to start a business, and even because you want to run a company.

365
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,470
These are wonderful accomplishments.

366
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:29,930
However, if you want things to be free forever, then that means you're parasites.

367
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:32,250
You don't need to run a company then.

368
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,410
I urge you to look over here!

369
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:44,250
On our cloud platform, the first year is free.

370
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,810
After that, you'll pay the rental price every year.

371
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:50,370
But I believe that once we expand the market,

372
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,030
the price you pay will decrease.

373
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:55,780
Please remember that you have a free year.

374
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:59,490
It's at least cheaper

375
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:01,900
than you spending money on traditional servers.

376
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,680
Isn't that the truth?

377
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,240
- We may consider it.
- We can try it.

378
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,070
This is really impressed me.

379
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:11,410
It's really okay to try.

380
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:14,510
Then I'll give you back your cent.

381
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,930
If you want to learn more about us,

382
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:19,930
Fang Wei is in the back.

383
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:21,940
You can add him on WeChat.

384
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,350
- Let me add you.
- Okay.

385
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,140
Come on!

386
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,120
- That's him, isn't it? Get out.
- Zhou Rui, come out!

387
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,790
- Get out! Get out!
- Don't leave!

388
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,850
You're so shameless!

389
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:58,740
He's getting out of here so fast.

390
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,160
Boss, what's going on?

391
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,030
- They should be clients.
- Then let's get out of here!

392
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,830
They must want to kill us.

393
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:11,020
They probably think that we're destroying their lives.

394
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:14,980
Don't back up!

395
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,710
What's going on?

396
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,900
Boss.

397
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,970
President Li.

398
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:29,430
Fang Wei, this has nothing to do with you. Go upstairs!

399
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:31,760
- Go upstairs!
- Give us a chance to explain.

400
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,510
- Let us explain!
- Leave now!

401
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:36,070
- Let us—
- President Li.

402
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,900
Zhou Rui, you shouldn't be doing this.

403
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:43,120
We're a small company that spent almost all our money on your servers.

404
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,250
It hasn't even been half a year yet, and you're telling us not to buy the servers anymore.

405
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,440
It's free to get on the cloud platform.

406
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,690
Are you playing with us?

407
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:17,100
We want a refund!

408
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,600
We want to break the contract!

409
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,760
Director Zhou, where are you?

410
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,340
We can't handle this for much longer.

411
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,670
You better step down!

412
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,080
Have some water.

413
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,050
Don't get riled up. Here! Here! Here!

414
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:30,350
Let's talk about this.

415
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,660
Listen up!

416
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,480
You'd better give us an explanation!

417
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,890
We'll solve this issue.

418
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:39,190
Lei Mo Ru, give me back my company!

419
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,770
If I didn't purchase your servers,

420
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:44,720
I wouldn't owe the bank money.

421
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,290
If I didn't owe the bank money, I wouldn't have met my wife.

422
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:52,100
Because of my wife... I just want to go public, I'm telling you.

423
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:56,340
I wouldn't have borrowed money to buy your servers if I didn't want to go public.

424
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,570
Now, I have no company,

425
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,700
- and no wife, either.
- You have it rough.

426
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,870
Where are your windows?

427
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:06,190
I'll jump from Jieke's windows right now!

428
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:08,200
Calm down!

429
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:13,360
- Let's talk about this.
- Go! Go! Go!

430
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,250
Let's jump out the window together!

431
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,930
- Don't stop me!
- Why are you grabbing me?

432
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,980
- I don't want to live anymore!
- I don't want to die.

433
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:22,260
- I don't want to be alive!
- Dude, don't be rash!

434
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,600
- Stop him!
- Don't stop me!

435
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,590
- It's not that big of a deal.
- Exactly.

436
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:29,730
- Look on the bright side, Young Man!
- Look on the bright side.

437
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:31,580
Why are you doing this?

438
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:34,170
Yes, yes, yes. Thank you for helping him to calm down.

439
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:36,200
That's not necessary! We're friends now.

440
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,280
It's just a company, at worst, we can just start over again.

441
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,330
Listen to me. Listen to me.

442
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:42,810
- Let's... Let's go somewhere else.
- Here.

443
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:45,680
- Let's go somewhere else to chat. Okay?
- Brother, what's your name?

444
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,380
- I'm–
- His name is Fang Wei.

445
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,820
He's from Jieke's sales department; I recognize him!

446
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,950
- You're Fang Wei?
- Fang Wei?

447
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,900
- How could you trick me?
- Don't use violence!

448
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,290
- Don't hit him!
- Hello? What did you say?

449
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:58,750
- I can't hear you!
- I'm not!

450
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,980
He's Fang Wei! He's the true Fang Wei.

451
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,430
I'm Cui Long. You guys, look!

452
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:05,090
Look! Cui Long! Me! Fang Wei!

453
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:08,960
- Don't run! Don't flee!
- Fang Wei, stop right there!

454
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,610
- Hurry up! Go after him!
- Don't let anything happen!

455
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:13,120
Don't run! Don't flee! Go, go , go! Stop right there!

456
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,880
Stop right there!

457
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:25,770
Director Xu, I don't think you should leave yet.

458
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:27,400
Have some more tea!

459
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,130
Director Wei, I still trust you.

460
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,920
Don't worry!

461
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,510
I just explained it to you.

462
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:36,120
Zhou Rui can't represent Jieke.

463
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,060
So my projects will continue as planned.

464
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,740
You also aren't optimistic about cloud computing?

465
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,400
You should know

466
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,460
that I've worked in traditional servers for so many years.

467
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,040
To be honest,

468
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,770
cloud computing will definitely be the future.

469
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:57,700
However, on the operation's stand point, it looks to be infeasible right now.

470
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,570
There are so many problems.

471
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,860
Fine! If you can give me something to explain to my company,

472
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,790
then we can continue to work together.

473
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:11,420
Rest assure! I'll report this truthfully to President Chen

474
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,800
to give you an answer you're satisfied with.

475
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:17,940
Have some tea! I'm going to check out the situation out there.

476
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,900
Okay.
[Jieke Company]

477
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,490
What did you see?

478
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,540
I saw everything.

479
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,890
Then you can leave now.

480
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,910
Director Zhou told me to join your team.

481
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,530
He doesn't call the shots for whom to be on my team.

482
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:17,050
I'm just letting you know that I'm not willing to be on your team.

483
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,220
Then you should remember this!

484
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,330
It doesn't matter to me whether or not you join,

485
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:34,360
but it's Zhou Rui you're offending.

486
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:57,610
Director Zhou, when I decided to buy your servers back then,

487
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:01,140
I really suffered to raise the money.

488
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:05,600
You are good now. You suddenly release cloud computing for one cent.

489
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,160
What would you do if you were in my shoes.

490
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,140
How about this?

491
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,330
I'll return the servers at the same price.

492
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:16,700
And then lease your cloud for one cent.

493
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:23,500
President Li, not all the industries

494
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,120
are suited for cloud computing.

495
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:31,990
You really should see my press conference, then you'll understand.

496
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:34,880
You can't get to the cloud just by leasing a server.

497
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,620
You need a cloud processing project to get to the cloud.

498
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:41,310
The reason why those industries want to use the cloud

499
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:45,140
is because of the cloud's scalability and pay by need

500
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:48,400
to lower their cost.

501
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,290
You've already bought so many servers

502
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:53,720
and you don't need to expand your operating scale.

503
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,210
- You really have no need for the cloud.
- I understand the rationale.

504
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:59,590
I also know I don't have to use the cloud.

505
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,770
Unless you lower the price of the traditional server,

506
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:05,910
I can't explain to the shareholders.

507
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:08,500
If they don't let go,

508
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,980
I won't be able to make the final payment to you.

509
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,980
- Let's go!
- Come.

510
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,180
Do you still know to come back?

511
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:04,420
I just went out for some air.

512
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,810
For you to get some air,

513
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:13,060
do you know how much it cost me?

514
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,010
You are the lead character of the press conference.

515
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:22,410
- Whether I was there or not isn't important.
- I don't want to argue with you.

516
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:24,820
If you don't want to work here, say it quickly.

517
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:27,480
Don't waste everyone's time!

518
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,490
I don't have any reason to quit.

519
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,750
Then you must keep up with my pace.

520
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:42,040
O&T Chairman Liu's son, Liu Yi Fan, also went to today's conference.

521
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,380
He said he went there for you.

522
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:47,950
Contact him immediately and apologize in person.

523
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:50,240
I'll take care of it.

524
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,490
Luo Jia, you must remember.

525
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:56,450
There is no right or wrong in the business field, only opponents.

526
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:59,420
Cherish this opportunity!

527
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,940
I can lead you into the profession.

528
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:13,480
If you don't get it, I can also kick you out.

529
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,560
Can I sit beside you?

530
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:59,650
Your head got smashed?

531
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,790
Did your head get smashed?

532
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:12,360
Do you think it's noisy?

533
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:17,720
I just want to feel

534
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:22,120
what it's like once my daughter gets a cochlear implant in her ears.

535
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,610
I think it's like torture.

536
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,570
My daughter can't hear.

537
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:31,320
She's deaf.

538
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:35,880
It's my fault.

539
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,730
I'm so busy that I can't take care of anything else.

540
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:47,180
Director Wei, I've never heard you say anything about your family.

541
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,830
I'm ill, too.

542
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:58,180
There is a technical term for this illness.

543
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:02,920
It's called Bipolar Disorder.

544
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,160
You aren't scared, are you?

545
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,680
No.

546
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:19,500
These medicines are for controlling excitement.

547
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,050
[Alprazolam Tablets]

548
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:26,910
Controlling excitement leads to depression.

549
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,250
Once depression is controlled,

550
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,720
I'd become a maniac.

551
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,350
There's no cure.

552
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:43,720
Director Wei, why are you telling me this?

553
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:48,220
I think you aren't treating me as an outsider.

554
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:56,380
I should've gone to the hospital today.

555
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:59,090
My daughter, today, is getting

556
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:01,860
the operation for the cochlear implant.

557
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:08,430
But, as soon as I heard

558
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:11,170
about the pre-surgery exam that she needs to do.

559
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:13,800
I started trembling all over

560
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,730
and my legs went soft.

561
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,390
What exam?

562
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:23,510
Promontory stimulation test.

563
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:29,030
It sounds pretty scary.

564
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,550
My daughter's name is...

565
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,480
Look at me!

566
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:43,260
Duo Duo.

567
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:46,340
- Duo Duo. (TN: Similar sound but different tone and has different meaning)
- No.

568
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:55,490
Duo Duo.

569
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:59,440
Duo Duo.

570
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:26,820
Sometimes, when I'm by myself,

571
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,880
I just want to die.

572
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:33,200
But I know that I can't die.

573
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,320
I must persist until

574
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,220
the day when Duo Duo can call me dad.

575
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,100
Director Wei, wipe your blood off.

576
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,390
Otherwise, it'll scare Duo Duo.
