- Don't call anymore!
- I just don't believe that I can't find him.

23
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,260
Don't call anymore!

24
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,530
We've lost this round.

25
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,060
What about your sales performance?

26
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,230
If I'm willing to gamble, I have to accept the loss.

27
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,820
If we're going to lose, then let's lose together.

28
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,950
Don't even think that!

29
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,610
Fang Wei, stay calm!

30
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,840
Do what you are supposed to do.

31
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,600
Boss, come and take a look.

32
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,320
- Come!
- Everyone, come and take a look, too.

33
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,070
Everyone, come here!

34
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,860
From the time Luo Jia caught Guo Han to intercepting him,

35
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,590
it only took her a few days.

36
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,310
Huikang using a dimensional reduction attack this time and was particularly harmful to us.

37
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,080
What exactly are you trying to say?

38
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,920
My instinct tells me that Luo Jia won't stop.

39
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,880
My turn!

40
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,720
Everyone, take a look!

41
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,300
Luo Jia told a horror story

42
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,520
to create fear in Guo Han. Why?

43
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,790
I Think it's pretty simple, customers indeed don't trust new technology.

44
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,910
If you think about it from a more complicated angle,

45
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:02,720
it's possible that Guo Han wants to cause destruction to both sides.

46
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,790
I'd rather believe the latter.

47
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,510
Me, too.

48
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,360
Boss, can I ask something I shouldn't ask?

49
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,130
Did you hurt Luo Jia a lot?

50
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,490
When trouble comes, let's deal with it.

51
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,740
We'll find a solution.

52
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,450
The first step, surround the target to attack their reinforcements.

53
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,150
Their people will intercept in our building's downstairs coffeeshop.

54
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,150
- Hi, I'm from Huikang Company.
- Sorry.

55
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,720
- Hello! Are you going to Jieke?
- Yes.

56
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,660
- Yes.
- Be careful!

57
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,460
Hello! I'm from Huikang Company.

58
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,680
- How about learning more about it?
- No. Thank you.

59
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,680
Are you Director Xu from Jieke?

60
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,920
It's because many customers will buy a cup of coffee downstairs when they come to visit us.

61
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:51,880
The second step, go deep into the tiger's den.

62
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,790
They'll also put promotional materials of their high-end solutions in the most eye-catching places.

63
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,580
Even though this isn't a B2B sales technique,
 (TN: business to business)

64
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,590
she wants to use a method of humiliation to enrage us.

65
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,040
Who put this here?!

66
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,930
What are you doing? What are you doing?

67
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,170
What are you guys doing?

68
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,350
Why are you moving it?

69
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,640
- What are you doing?
- Don't fight!

70
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,360
But, don't worry!

71
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,390
The ones they surround and intercept are only a portion of the customers.

72
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:23,130
They can't get close to our actual, more valuable core customers.

73
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,750
So you must safeguard your customer info and not let them get leaked.

74
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,230
- Understood?
- Don't move!
- What are you doing?

75
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,820
- You touched me.
- No, I didn't.

76
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,430
Who touched you?

77
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,090
- Don't... don't be like that. Don't be like that, okay?
- Don't touch it!

78
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,030
Why are you being so unreasonable?

79
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,730
I'll move it. I'll move it. Okay?

80
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,190
It's fine. It's fine.

81
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,870
It's fine.

82
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,100
Boss.

83
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:10,350
Boss, since we've considered Huikang's every step,

84
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,430
why aren't we fighting back?

85
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:14,910
Fighting back?

86
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,420
And cause destruction to us both in the end?

87
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,590
A small-to-middle sized client like Guo Han

88
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,170
is insignificant to them.

89
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:30,380
But to us, we can't lose even one.

90
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,760
Isn't that all the more reason to fight then?

91
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,830
I don't want to live like that anymore.

92
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,560
I don't know what this kind of fighting is for.

93
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:28,120
- Director Zhou.
- Why are you here?

94
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,020
It's getting late.

95
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,370
Why is the almighty Sales Director of Jieke

96
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,800
still living in a rental apartment?

97
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,890
Who told you I'm renting?

98
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,510
Why are you here?

99
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,850
I came to give you a KPI.
(TN: referring to helping his sales performance)

100
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:07,230
A basket of eggs will help me meet the sales performance that I can't meet?

101
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,950
Director Zhou,

102
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,280
I have a few shell companies.

103
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,560
We can do fake contracts.

104
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,490
That's illegal!

105
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,360
Then I... I still have a little over two million in personal savings.

106
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,910
Is that enough?

107
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,980
You come to my place first thing in the morning to force me.

108
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,960
Are you considering me your brother?

109
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,770
I don't care if you acknowledge it or not, but I definitely think of you as a brother.

110
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,030
However, that isn't what I'm here to talk about.

111
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:44,110
I came here today because of this basket of eggs.

112
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,130
A client of mine gave me this basket of eggs.

113
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,690
Originally, he had the eggs, but couldn't sell them.

114
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:55,060
He only makes a few thousand bucks a month.

115
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:59,430
But now, because he has my Fast's rural logistics system,

116
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:02,700
last month, he earned thirty thousand yuan.

117
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,870
Even the chickens are exhausted!

118
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,070
You don't have the servers anymore, do you?

119
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,940
How did you do it?

120
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,670
I moved all the data to the cloud.

121
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:15,170
It's cloud computing, Zhou Rui.

122
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,190
This is still not what I wanted to say.

123
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,800
Then... Then... Then what do you want to say?

124
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,590
No! You taught me this.

125
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,460
To benefit others, they have to need you.

126
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,310
Have you forgotten?

127
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:37,790
Old Cao, this doesn't sound like something you'd say.

128
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,130
How is it? How does it feel to be needed by others?

129
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,160
Does it feel amazing?

130
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,960
How do I say this?

131
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,190
It really feels more amazing than making money.

132
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,710
Old Cao,

133
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:02,350
thank you for coming over this morning.

134
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,760
Why do I always keep paying attention

135
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,430
to those projects worth more than tens of millions of dollars,

136
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:15,390
but forget that those small stores, small workshops, and small businesses

137
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,440
are the ones that really need Fast logistics?

138
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,370
Cloud computing logistics.

139
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,460
"Cloud computing logistics."

140
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,470
- So am I a part of your plans?
- What a question!

141
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,690
Do you think I'll let you eat this basket of eggs for free?

142
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,870
Okay.

143
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:37,350
- We're brothers now.
- We already were.

Director Zhou.

146
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,000
Instead of waiting for you to come, I may as well wait for you here.

147
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,560
Come!

148
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,650
Come!

Sir, your coffee.

150
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,710
My apology, Director Zhou! I've already decided to sign a contract with Director Luo.

151
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,360
Then... President Guo, you spending time waiting for me here,

152
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,470
it isn't just to apologize to me, is it?

153
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,780
First, it's to apologize, and then, it's to explain.

154
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:24,830
Then can I say a few words first?

155
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:26,850
Alright.

156
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:30,360
To a business, what is the reason to find customers?

157
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,650
What is the standard when choosing a collaboration partner?

158
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:36,960
Ultimately, what's the most important is probably still the quantity of customer flow.

159
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,290
The flow that you mentioned, our management calls it consumer flow.

160
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:42,340
It isn't a frigid concept, but a living person.

161
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,250
It's you, it's me, and it's them.

162
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,410
Do you really think these people care about your "free of charge?"

163
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:51,610
- Can you let me finish talking first?
- Director Zhou, please listen to me first.

164
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,740
- But once I finish talking, you can understand what I mean—
- No, no. It's like this.

165
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,530
It's like this!

166
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,560
Listen to me first!

167
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,430
Okay, please.

168
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:05,950
Your scale is only ten percent of the cardinal number, but it can't satisfy me.

169
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:08,060
Yes. Your solution may be very cheap, but sorry!

170
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:11,250
My affiliated group has over a dozen people who work hard every year to earn money.

171
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,200
Each year will burn two million.

172
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,900
Sometimes, they burn tens of millions just to hear a sound.

173
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,120
- If we don't have direct profit; of course, I have to withdraw.
- Okay, I'll admit it to you.

174
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,790
Free of charge is indeed a gimmick.

175
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:24,530
In the future, you still have to pay for our operating cost, maintenance fee, and service charge.

176
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,450
It is indeed a huge cost, but do you know?

177
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,520
What I'm doing now is the real direction of the future.

178
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,470
You have to be patient to see that I'll be able to gradually incubate it.

179
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:34,960
First of all, I can't wait for you, and secondly, what you call "cost" isn't a cost.

180
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,390
- Time is the real cost.
- Time is...

181
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,830
Sorry, Director Zhou! Can you lower your voices over here?

182
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:42,380
- We still have other customers here.
- Sorry, sorry!

183
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,080
Thank you, Director Zhou.

184
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:56,940
President Guo, first of all, I wish you a happy collaboration with Director Luo.

185
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,790
However, I firmly believe that you'll come back to find me.

186
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:03,730
Because, to me, you all are a bunch of fat rabbits.

187
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:09,630
[Jieke Company]

188
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,220
What is this? An appeal before sentencing?

189
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:22,800
- No, this is sales performance.
- Sales performance?

190
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,330
Can this be given to the finance department to book into the account?

191
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:31,810
Or, maybe you can tell me whose name we put on the invoice for your sales performance?

192
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:36,450
Master, I remember when I first entered this field,

193
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:39,500
someone once told me something.

194
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,620
He said, "For our internet industry, C-end
(TN: C-end is business-to-consumer business model.)"

195
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:47,580
"and only C-end is the real future."
(TN: C-end = A model where products/services are delivered directly to the end user.)

196
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,270
That person told me that before, too.

197
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,980
After all these years, this is the first time

198
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,230
that you've quoted his words.

199
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,990
This has nothing to do with personal feelings,

200
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,940
but I've been feeling more and more these past few years that

201
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,480
- he makes sense.
- It makes sense technically.

202
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:10,080
In our internet field, technology and sales can't be separated.

203
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,300
Master, you taught me this.

204
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,950
How much of the cash flow can your C-end clients maintain every month?

205
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:19,800
How much does it cost the company every month for your C-end clients?

206
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,160
I've included the project estimate and the expected revenue for the next five years.

207
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,230
You can call the marketing and finance departments over to discuss it.

208
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,860
I thought you wanted to shirk responsibility and didn't want to shoulder it.

209
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,210
It appears you aren't like that.

210
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,470
You're insane.

211
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,430
- Master, why don't you look at it first before we discuss?
- There's no need to look at it.

212
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,900
I'll ask you two questions.

213
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,660
First of all, among your customer resources,

214
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,040
how many are B-end (business-to-business model), and how many are C-end?

215
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,850
I only have B-end, no C-end.

216
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:54,120
Second question.

217
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,530
Among all the big sales regions, from South China to Northeast China,

218
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,950
how many are B-end and how many are C-end customers?

219
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:04,570
There are only B-end and there isn't a single C-end client.

220
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:08,730
- It appears you know it well.
- However, this is exactly the biggest problem we're currently facing.

221
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:12,810
What's the problem? Give up B-end clients and turn to C-end clients?

222
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:16,060
Ruin the Great Wall ourselves and disable our own martial arts skills?

223
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:20,130
Master, it's because our company has no C-end clients.

224
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:24,650
Our entire company relies only on B-end customers to support our cash flow.

225
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,690
Then if there is any trouble in the B-end customers,

226
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:30,370
or if the competitor fights a price war, we'll become very passive.

227
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,330
We can only choose to lower or even give up profit

228
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:37,990
to maintain it, then... then is this an effective solution?

229
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:42,280
No, it isn't! We can only choose between loss and bankruptcy, whichever is the lessor of the two evils.

230
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,980
Master, this is a road that waits for death.

231
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,930
It looks like you aren't waiting to die.

232
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:49,080
You're looking for an early death.

233
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:55,080
Master. Master, listen to me!

234
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,290
For the past ten years, our work has been gearing towards B-end clients.

235
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,620
However, it's a fact that we're almost reaching the end of this road.

236
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,340
If we don't get ahead before the next industrial wave arrives

237
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,930
and expand our business to C-end,

238
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:09,850
I really worry if we'll even be qualified to take part in the next round.

239
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:13,950
With what you said, I fear it isn't just Jieke that is waiting to die.

240
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:17,650
You want to tell me that I'm waiting to die.

241
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,920
Master,

242
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,400
no one stands taller than you in Jieke,

243
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,680
and no one sees farther than you do.

244
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,950
If even I can see it, then you must've seen it long ago.

245
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:31,690
However, I really don't understand.

246
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:34,640
Why do you keep delaying on taking action?

247
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,880
There is a hurtful phrase.

248
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:43,630
Back then, I said it to someone else.

249
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:51,030
I even pledged an oath

250
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,420
that I would never say it to anyone else in this lifetime.

251
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,120
But today,

252
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,340
I can't help but say it to you.

253
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,250
What is it?

254
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,380
In your entire life, you've only ever been able to be a tech person.

255
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,360
After you said this back then, he left.

256
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,470
That was the last thing I said to him.

257
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:28,060
I won't shirk from responsibility, and I didn't want to anger you.

258
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:31,370
But Master, you're wrong.

259
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,750
You're exactly like him.

260
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,370
Consider that I'm blind then.

261
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,860
The established reality is already in front of us.

262
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,550
I don't want to sit and wait for death.

263
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:56,480
I also don't want to see Jieke, the company that I've fought alongside you these past ten years,

264
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,520
and the Master whom I've followed for ten years to slowly fall into an abyss.

265
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,870
I'll wait for my death, and you can seek your own death.

266
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:07,380
Master, then you'll live a life that's worse than death.

267
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,840
- Then what about you?
- Me?

268
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,350
I'll go towards death in order to stay alive.

269

[Have Moral Integrity, There Exists Promising]

270
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:57,320
Grandma, what did you forget to take with you again?

271
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,060
I was just about to look for you.

272
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,850
What's the matter?

273
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,490
I installed an app on my grandma's phone to prevent her from going missing.

274
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:17,900
It needs two emergency contacts.

275
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:23,020
I know.

276
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,050
The other one is me.

277
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,560
In 1967,

278
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:17,110
Cellist Jacqueline du Pré married the pianist and conductor, Daniel Barenboim.

279
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:19,900
It's a great love story from the classical music world.

280
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:29,370
This is one of the best cello performances that I've ever heard.

281
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,790
I'm giving you this album.

282
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:56,150
I don't think you've ever used your vinyl player before.

283
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:58,320
No, I haven't.

284
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,350
Why are you leaving suddenly?

285
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,760
It's because of you.

286
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,650
"Because of me?"

287
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:27,020
Every knife you cut sees blood. Didn't you know?

288
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,050
I can't pretend that I have no feelings, can I?

289
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:31,550
I can only wipe the blood on my body clean

290
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:34,170
- and bury it—
- Zhuo Rui, I don't want to hear you ramble.

291
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,200
I want to open up a new battlefield.

292
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,730
I'm leaving for Northwest China

293
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:45,410
to start from the bottom with the small-to-mid sized businesses.

294
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,940
Zhou Rui,

295
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:13,950
from this moment on, don't look at me or interrupt me while I'm talking.

296
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:16,230
I'm afraid I'll change my mind.

297
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,310
When I mentioned breaking up before,

298
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:34,240
I was emotional. Did you know?

299
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,930
Every time after I get emotional,

300
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:40,450
I would regret that I hurled those hurtful words to you.

301
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:45,550
But actually, you're in my heart.

302
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,350
Do you know that?

303
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,860
I don't want to love many people.

304
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,120
I also don't want to love many times.

305
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,670
I only want to know,

306
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:07,230
if you must have someone in your future plans, why can't that person be me?

307
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,430
- Luo Jia—
- Don't interrupt!

308
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,600
I have to interrupt.

309
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,220
You're in my heart.

310
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:21,790
It's only outside of your work and during leisure time, isn't it?

311
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:24,160
Aren't all men like this?

312
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,750
However, you don't have much free time.

313
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,800
- Luo Jia—
- I told you not to interrupt me.

314
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,720
Zhou Rui,

315
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:45,340
I know you already tried your best.

316
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,050
However, what I want,

317
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:53,070
you still can't give it to me.

318
00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:00,640
It's because neither of us will change for the other.

319
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,990
We loved each other before.

320
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,800
We've had each other in our hearts before.

321
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,940
To be honest,

322
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,560
that's enough...

323
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,060
Therefore,

324
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,230
I want to tell you,

325
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,960

- Are you getting use to blocking my car?
- Director Zhou.

Don't you think something good happens whenever I stop your car?

340
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:38,260
Something good? Such as?

341
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,970
Such as, look behind you!

342
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,980
Boss!

343
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:11,450
[Penalty Notification]
[Our company's employee, Zhou Rui, Sales Director, has disobeyed the company's decision, and is now punished with leave without pay.]

344
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:14,740
Leave without pay

345
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,740
is the best that I can do for you.

346
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,940
Hi!

347
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,700
Mister, here.

348
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,220
For you! You've worked hard.

349
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,390
You've worked hard, Mister.

350
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,400
Who's seen the bottled waters?

351
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,690
Fang Wei, hyou seen those bottled waters?

352
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,960
You must've forgotten it.

353
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,240
Twist it! Twist the legs counterclockwise.

354
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,360
Everyone, come over here for a bit!

355
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:04,450
This is the local village officer that I previously mentioned to you all before.

356
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,900
He's called Shi Peng Fei who can help us resolve many local problems.

357
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,750
- This is Old Cao.
- I'm Cao Tian You.

358
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,120
- Call me Xiao Shi.
- Fang Wei. Bei Yao Yao.
- Hello.

359
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,070
- Hello.
- Hello. Hello!
- Sit. Sit. Have a seat!

360
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,070
Come, come, come!

361
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,310
I'll go to get something to eat first.

362
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,240
- Sit down first!
- Drink whatever you want. Open it and drink it.

363
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,770
- Help me hold it for a bit.
- Okay.

364
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,890
You Shi guy, where are you running to?

365
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:28,730
- I just don't believe your four wheels can run faster than my four hoofs.
- No, wait! What are you doing?

366
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,360
- What do you mean "what am I doing?"
- They are guests. What are you doing?

367
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,660
- What guests?
- What are you doing?

368
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,630
I lost my cattle again!

369
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,870
- I know that.
- If you know, why did you run away and didn't help me search for it?

370
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:39,090
- What's going on?
- He lost his cattle.

371
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,950
Lost his cattle?

372
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,400
Come with me to search for the cattle!

373
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,580
- It tastes good.
- Boss.

374
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,130
Thanks.

375
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,620
- Director Zhou,
- Go over there and get us something to eat.

376
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,590
be the judge for us!

377
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,660
I pleaded with Hasi Bagen

378
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,480
not to contract out the ranch.

379
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,580
Those city people will occupy your land and won't do any work.

380
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,720
If you... you've done ranching half your lifetime,

381
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,960
then you go to work in the city, what kind of work can you do?

382
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,860
What kind of money can you make, right?

383
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:15,020
Shi guy, what money can you talk about with me?

384
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,290
You made us tear down our fences,

385
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:21,150
and put some rings on the cattle saying it's high-tech, and what's the result?

386
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,950
Don't you know how many cattle have been lost?

387
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:25,370
I-I already promised you.

388
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:28,660
I'll find each and every one of your cattle for you.

389
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,300
If they aren't found, I'll compensate you.

390
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,590
You'll compensate me?

391
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,170
- What are you going to compensate me with?
- Eat that.

392
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:36,920
- Use money to compensate.
- Do I look like I need money?

393
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,540
We've been ranching for several generations.

394
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,890
We don't need money! I'm bored with it.

395
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:44,160
Anyway, I-I'm telling you,

396
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,960
you can't contract out the ranch to the city people.

397
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,090
They will ruin the legacy of several decades of ranching culture.

398
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:52,120
Xiao Shi, I have a general idea...

399
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,830
A general...

400
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:56,070
I have a general understanding about your standpoint.

401
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:59,400
But can you tell me exactly what happened?

402
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:01,270
You say it!

403
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,180
You say it.

404
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,220
Y-You say it!

405
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,660
He tore down our fences.

406
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,420
He insisted on putting on some rings on our cattle.

407
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,930
Some high-tech rings, right?

408
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:18,500
- In the end, we lost the cattle.
- Electronic collar.

409
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,500
- How is the signal transmitted?
- By radio transmission.

410
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,980
The signal machine is in my car, but the signal keeps disconnecting.

411
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,890
Just think! I studied liberal arts.

412
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:30,760
- Another cup.
- I don't know how to tinker with that machine sometimes.

413
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,870
Even when I drive the car in front of the cattle, the machine still doesn't do anything.

414
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:37,010
I get it. I get it!

415
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:40,380
The cattle are lost, then you're in trouble.

416
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:44,410
It's trouble to him, but it's a loss to us.

417
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:46,070
Each ox costs over ten thousand yuan.

418
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:49,630
You want to compensate? Can you afford to?

419
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:57,830
- Director Zhou, let's not talk about cloud computing today.
- Okay.

420
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:02,440
I need to drive the car to help him search for the cattle right now.

421
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,160
As for the proposal for Sky and Earth,

422
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,090
I won't give it to you for now.

423
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:09,270
I'll think of a solution to help you solve your problem.

424
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,000
Th-Thank you, Director Zhou.

425
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,660
I'm leaving then.

426
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,090
Brother, what's your name?

427
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:21,080
Hasi Bagen.

428
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,460
Come!

429
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:27,560
Jieke Faster Company.

430
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,740
I'll help you find the cattle.

431
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,920
The cattle are really difficult to find.

432
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,710
The radio transmission has problems.

433
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,440
Using radio transmissi is too weak.

434
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,170
I think it's because of the Beidou.
 (TN: Beidou Navigation Satellite System)

435
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,970
- Go!
- Here!

436
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:09,330
- You're impressive, Mr. Lin.
- Let me try!

437
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:11,250
- Okay.
- Try it.

438
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:19,920
Please tell President Lin that I'm here.

439
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,550
- President Lin,
- What?

440
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,280
there's a Mr. Wei outside.

441
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,880
- He said he has an appointment with you.
- I got it.

442
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,200
- Okay. Continue to play first! I'll go and see.
- Go ahead.

443
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,600
Open your mouth! Go in.

444
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,020
President Lin.

445
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,240
You're 15 minutes late.

446
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:54,720
Do you know that in 15 minutes,

447
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,420
- you can negotiate a neither too big nor too small deal?
- I'm sorry.

448
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,790
I had to take care of some things at home.

449
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,000
Why do you smell like the hospital?

450
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:11,320
- President Lin, last time you said—
- Change your bad habits!

451
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,690
Don't just get straight to the point.

452
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:15,880
That's all I know to do.

453
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,900
Our suppliers are putting off supplying our materials and now they're raising their prices.

454
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:23,190
These are signs that Americans give off before they they cut off supply.

455
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:28,130
Director Wei, the Americans have talked about cutting off the Chinese's chip supply for many years now.

456
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:32,440
Whether people believe it or not, and even if they really do cut us off,

457
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,260
then Jieke still won't be the only one who'll have problems.

458
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:39,140
Internet companies throughout China will all be affected.

459
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,910
You're a salesman.

460
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,790
Do you have to be that worried?

461
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,590
Okay.

462
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,460
Let me talk about another matter then.

463
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:01,790
O&T's Chairman Liu, Liu Feng, is also interested in Jieke.

464
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:05,240
You should know about this, shouldn't you?

465
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,320
If this matter

466
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:14,260
is true, it still can't be said with certainty if it's a blessing or a curse.

467
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:18,570
But for you, it's definitely not a blessing.

468
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,430
To show sincerity,

469
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:35,920
I've already sent a client's information to Director Luo last time.

470
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:41,010
In here, it's everything.

471
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:45,110
Is the agreement between us still valid?

472
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,840
Of course, it's still valid.

473
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,060
Come on, President Lin!

474
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:25,100
- Bye-bye.
- Goodbye!
- Bye-bye!

475
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,110
- Bye bye!
- Thank you!
- Thanks!

476
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:29,390
Come back again next time, Brother!

477
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:34,380
What's the matter, Big Guy?

478
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:38,370
We should at least, give a gift on the first meeting upon coming here.

479
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,970
Are you trying to be a do gooder again and save people from disaster?

480
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,290
Bei Yao Yao.

481
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:50,340
A free drone! You take care of it.

482
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,130
- Okay.
- Fang Wei!

483
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:55,330
I know what I need to do.

484
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:08,500
Hello, this is Zhong Lian Technology Company, is it?

485
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:12,220
I am O&T's Director Zhao's friend.

486
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,320
Right, Zhao Lan.

487
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:17,760
- Hello!
- We want to request the approximate location

488
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,660
- Chairman Wang.
- of something that uses a radio transmitter.

489
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,150
- Hello, hello!
- Cattle. It's cattle.

490
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:25,610
Have you received the beef jerky I sent you?

491
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:28,000
Why are you thankful? It wasn't worth much.

492
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,820
- It's a small gift, but holds a lot of meaning.
- What else do we need to install for it?

493
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,270
Yes, please give me your email. I'll send you the configuration right away.

494
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:36,430
I'm really not asking about the loan.

495
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:38,250
I'm really not.

496
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,240
- Go ahead and tell me.
 - Quantity?

497
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:45,150
- It won't end up being a small quantity.
- Okay, all right. I understand.

498
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:48,030
Gao Jian, have you received my email?

499
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:50,600
Yes, the main meaning is that.

500
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,490
Hurry! I'll be waiting for your news.

501
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:55,190
Thank you.

Cui Long, if the facial mask you gave me doesn't save my face,

508
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,890
I'll kill you!

509
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:54,740
- Who is it?
 - It's me, Shen Jia Zhen.

510
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:03,320
I'm coming.

511
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:18,180
What's the matter?

512
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,980
I'm having my period, so my stomach hurts.

513
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:24,690
Women were born to suffer.

514
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:28,160
Hurry! Quickly get up. Quickly get up.

515
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,160
Quickly go to the sofa to lie down.

516
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:35,330
Go on! Go on!

517
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,600
Grandma.

518
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,040
I have medicine in my briefcase.

519
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,710
- Where is your briefcase?
- Over there.

520
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:49,150
I'll get it for you.

521
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,920
Is this it?

522
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:06,470
No, it isn't this one.

523
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,610
It's this one.

524
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,960
This isn't a pain killer.

525
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,190
It's okay. I always take this.

526
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:19,760
If you take a lot of this medicine, you won't be able to have kids.

527
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,580
Why are you messing around?

528
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,720
Don't have children?

529
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,050
Does Ungrateful Child know?

530
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,680
No, he doesn't.

531
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:33,240
You don't have to have a baby with him.

532
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,360
But you'll have your own child eventually, won't you?

533
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,430
If you mistreat your body right now,

534
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:43,660
you'll be the one suffering later.

535
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:55,260
Just endure the pain.

536
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,540
You have to stop taking the medicine.

537
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:41,560
[Yao Yao, I come late]

538
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,840
[Yao Yao, I come late]

539
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:52,420
[Yao Yao, I come late]

540
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,440
Brother, thank you very much!

541
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,120
Have another sip, Brother.

542
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,620
- No, I've drank too much.
- Brother. Brother, drink some more!

543
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:01,310
- I can't anymore.
- Take another sip! I need to thank you.

544
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:03,360
Brother! Brother, stop sleeping!

545
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,960
Drink some! If you're dizzy, who will I drink it with?

546
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,730
- If you can't, then I will.
- Drink slowly.
- He can't drink anymore!

547
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:11,440
I have to thank my brother.

548
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,150
Drink some!

549
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:16,260
Come, Fang Wei!

550
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,810
Everyone, let's drink together!

551
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:22,630
Drink up! Come on!

552
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,980
- Get up.
- Say no more.

553
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:27,650
You'd drink it all in one go if we were good friends.

554
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:31,340
Cheers.

555
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:48,800
Bei Yao Yao, I'm not here to see you.

556
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,070
I'm here to deliver the drone.

557
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,200
I know.

558
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,470
Sounds good.

559
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:59,580
I also don't think you're here because of me.

560
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,490
You posted it onto our WeChat Moments.

561
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:07,540
If you didn't want me to come, you could have blocked me.

562
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,420
Fine!

563
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,010
- Slow down.
- Wait!

564
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:28,770
- Hi.
- Hey.

565
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:32,790
Bei Yao Yao, I'm the only one who can see your WeChat Moments, am I not?

566
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:34,930
Everyone can see it.

567
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:39,380
But the one who was able to get here, is still really only you.

568
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,760
Just now, it's your words!

569
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:46,960
I think my coming here was worth it.

570
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:52,530
- I'll give you a toast.
- Come on! Have a drink!

571
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:57,380
You're overthinking, aren't you?

572
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,910
Let me tell you the truth!

573
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:02,110
I don't want to date.

574
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:08,250
- Give me a reason!
- I don't trust you.

575
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,480
Then whom do you trust?

576
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,430
Work!

577
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:17,500
So are you planning to spend the rest of your life with work?

578
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,820
Cui Long, let me tell you.

579
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,280
I've been hurt by someone before.

580
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,850
I've hurt someone else, too.

581
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:35,920
It was ruthless.

582
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:38,790
Bei Yao Yao, let me also tell you something.

583
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:42,640
I don't know about your past, and you don't have to talk harshly.

584
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,540
I have only one request.

585
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,560
Give me some more time!

586
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,680
Okay. I'm leaving now.

587
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:02,690
You just said to give you some time.

588
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:06,480
How long is it then?

00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,730

Don't you know what express delivery is?

598
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:42,760
