24

Why are you waiting for me?

You go in first.

31
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,550
What a coincidence!

32
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,690
Director Zhou, the taste of your tie is below standard.

33
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:52,280
- You bought it yourself or is it a gift?
- It's borrowed.

34
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,660
Director Luo, your scarf is very nice.

35
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,020
If it was blue, it would look even better.

36
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,490
Both guests, this way, please!

37
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,760
Why didn't you wear the one I gave you?

38

We'll talk later.

40
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,560
Yesterday, you didn't wear the one I gave you, either.

We'll pick a few questions for them to answer.

51
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,400
Let's start our topic today.

52
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,180
It's exactly the necessary qualities for new sales.

53
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,260
There are a lot of people who are new to sales.

54
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,820
They need some suggestions to avoid going through obstacles.

55
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,690
Director Zhou, you go first.

56
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,230
Okay.

57
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,820
I brought a photo with me today.

58
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,630
This photo was taken when I got my first order.

59
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,020
This person is our Jieke's President.

60
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,630
My Master, Chen Ming Kai.

61
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:36,190
He wrote this on the back of the photo.
[There is no shortcut in sales. Be sincere and keep your promise!]
[Chen Ming Kai]

62
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:39,870
Linda just said earlier, how can we avoid going through obstacles?

63
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,110
As long as you remember these thirteen words,

64
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,550
I'm sure you can avoid these obstacles.

65
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,630
I'll read it you all now.

66
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,210
"There is no short cut in sales.

67
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:53,000
Be sincere and keep your promise!"

68
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,410
Remember these thirteen words, you won't be going through any obstacles.

69
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,730
Of course, I'm talking about an ideal situation.

70
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,460
However, in reality,

71
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,570
who doesn't like shortcuts?

72
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,970
But everyone, please remember!

73
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:14,280
If one day you go through a shortcut and you need to re-do the same route.

74
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:19,130
You would've question yourself, you've lost, or you've won?

75
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,040
The script doesn't sound right.

76
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,690
It has all been arranged. Rest assured!

77
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,810
Excuse me, Sir! Would you like to order anything else?

78
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,460
No. Thank you.

79
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,530
- Hi Miss.
- Yes, Sir?

80
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:50,540
Can I ask you about a person?

81
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,770
He is my sister's boyfriend.

82
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,740
I wasn't onboard with both of them getting together.

83
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,890
But now,

84
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:00,260
we've prepared the wedding and banquet.

85
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,060
However, he ran away, my sister almost committed suicide.

86
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,390
Right now, she's still lying in the hospital.

87
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,450
I don't have any ill will.

88
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,560
I just want to find him.

89
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,200
I just want him to tell the truth to my sister.

90
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,010
He can break up with her.

91
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,800
However, if he wants to run away,

92
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,990
at least, he should give us a heads up.

93
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:21,370
- Do you think if that is reasonable?
- Yes.

94
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,640
Let me see!

95
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:29,320
- I think I've seen him before.
- Have you seen him around lately?

96
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,100
Not lately.

97
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:36,890
What about this? Leave me your number.

98
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,260
When I see him, I'll contact you immediately.

99
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:46,310
Talk about a difficult customer you've encountered then.

100
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,230
Once, for a customer, I waited in the countryside for the entire night.

101
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:54,160
[Jieke runs buy-sell agreement for their goods! Director Zhou, please explain!]

102
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,260
Dump goods?

103
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,800
Jieke runs buy-sell agreement for their goods. Director Zhou, please explain?

104
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,950
Director Zhou, what is this matter?

105
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,280
Buy-sell agreements on goods in the sales world is nothing new.

106
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,660
It's also called flee goods, skip goods, or dump goods.

107
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,560
I'll give you guys a simple example.

108
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,940
If this feed is real...

109
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,220
I said "if," please don't mind me, Director Zhou.

110
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,630
If Jieke has Distributors A and B

111
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,720
that are responsible for sales in the Eastern and Western regions respectively,

112
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,420
in order to increase your sales number,

113
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,100
Distributor A in Eastern region uses a lower price and sells them to Distribution B in the Western region.

114
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,110
This is called a buy-sell agreement.

115
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,360
If Distributor A did it deliberately, that's a hostile buy-sell agreement.

116
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,570
That's what it is. Is that correct, Director Zhou?

117
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:46,880
Is this what happened, Director Zhou?

118
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,540
This way, we'll lose the distributor's confidence in both our products

119
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,770
and our clients confidence.

120
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,210
As a domino effect,

121
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:59,610
ultimately, it'll lead to the collapse of our sales structure.

122
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,180
I think this is the industry's faux pas.

123
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,810
Moreover, it's also considered an insult and a scandal.

124
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,730
Director Zhou, can I ask a follow-up question.

125
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,510
Is this accusation just now valid?

126
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:13,450
- Does Jieke have any buy-sell agreement problem?
- It doesn't exist.

127
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,300
Then the live feed just now was a deliberate attack on Jieke, wasn't it?

128
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,900
Yes.

129
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:25,670
[Director Zhou is lying. Liu Yu Fan has a lot of Jieke's servers currently being sold at below market price.]

130
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,640
Director Zhou, you might have offended someone, haven't you?

131
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,010
I don't know this Liu Yu Fan.

132
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,760
Then I'm also curious now.

133
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,820
First, I want to thank all the online viewers who left me messages.

134
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,190
I see it as an alarm.

135
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:48,630
If there is a buy-sell situation in Jieke, I definitely won't let that go.

136
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,430
In fact, there is a saying in the sales world.

137
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:55,310
"Product shortage is like a tiger, buy-sell is like a wolf."

138
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,990
Today, after I leave this studio,

139
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,950
the first thing I'll do is to go back to my office and start an investigation.

140
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:05,640
If Jieke really has this buy-sell situation, will you dare admit it in public?

141
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,840
That isn't the only thing I'll do.

142
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,680
He's going to admit it.

143
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:15,950
There must be someone who wants to mess us up; in addition, they're also an insider.

144
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,770
Everything was sold by following the company protocol.

145
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,450
We earned the money. How serious can this be?

146
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,120
The company's reputation is totally ruined.

147
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,570
It's the worst of the worst.

148
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:32,330
From now on, no one is allowed to talk about this.

149
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:35,500
If you slip a word, it'll be on the Beijing team.

150
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,470
- Where is Fang Wei?
- He didn't come in.

151
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,390
Be quick! Be quick!

152
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,620
Is it because they couldn't split the stolen goods evenly and now, there's bite back?

153
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,370
I think it's likely very possible.

154
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,640
I heard the entire Public Relation team is now in action.

155
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,340
If this news has spread, I can tell you all of us is done for.

156
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,120
What are you guys still chatting about?

157
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,800
Shut your mouth!

158
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,240
Hi! That one...

159
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,730
- You left suddenly last night to deal with this problem, didn't you?
- Yes.

160
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,850
Why didn't you tell me?

161
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,810
I'll tell you once I've investigated it thoroughly.

162
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,760
What if I want to know, now?

163
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,610
We're competitors, I cannot tell you.

164
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:32,020
When the door is closed, I become your girlfriend.

165
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,710
Tell me!

166
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:46,670
If you leave now, you're proving that your dumping of goods is true.

167
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,370
I told you!

168
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,100
I'm investigating it right now.

169
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,820
Zhou Rui, whether you did dump the goods or not,

170
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,520
I'll know sooner or later.

171
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:07,320
However, telling me from your own lips is very important to me.

172
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:31,780
Director Zhou, my apologies! Earlier, to boost the viewership numbers, I probed a little too much.

173
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,510
He's been through worse. No problem!

174
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,210
The data has come out.

175
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:40,770
The viewership numbers shoot off the charts.

176
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,340
I've asked Fang Wei to contact Liu Yu Fan.

177
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,050
- We'll terminate the contract to cut our losses as soon as possible.
- You signed the contract.

178
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,070
You ruined the reputation of Jieke Company.

179
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,230
The bottom line of integrity?

180
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,250
I just feel embarrassed on Master's behalf.

181
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,820
Wei Yan,

182
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,060
you also don't have to feel embarrassed for me.

183
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,240
I've already been utterly embarrassed.

184
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,890
During the Broad-View Forum, the screen was full of live comments.

185
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:18,590
Who knows which person was manipulating from behind?

186
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,540
Do you doubt me?

187
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,020
Let's just talk about the matter on hand then.

188
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:27,230
Director Zhou, tell us! How are you going to resolve this?

189
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,490
Master, the financial loss caused by Fang Wei's contract

190
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,270
just deduct it from the Beijing team's sales performance.

191
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:37,070
I'll take responsibility for this and investigate properly.

192
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:40,480
Zhou Rui, inform Fang Wei that he's suspended from work and will undergo investigation.

193
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,440
Master, the one undergoing investigation should be Zhou Rui.

194
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,220
Wei Yan, do you feel that the one being suspended from work should be me?

195
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,990
Dad, what I did isn't against the law, is it?

196
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:11,960
Don't forget! Other than the laws, there are also our family rules.

197
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,150
Currently, the whole internet

198
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,930
is full of reports of your dumping goods.

199
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:21,390
Don't let our Liu family's clean image be damaged by your actions.

200
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,110
Dad, I've made a profit.

201
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,770
I've earned money.

202
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:27,100
Whose money did you use to earn that money?

203
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,430
Right now, you bought so many servers.

204
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,620
Where did you get so much money from?

205
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,870
It was my own.

206
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,830
Tell me the truth!

207
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,540
Uncle Lin Zhen Wei lent it to me.

208
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,300
How much did you borrow?

209
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,470
About ten million yuan.

210
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:45,490
You currently made a loss on this deal, how were you going to pay him back?

211
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,100
I never expected to have a loss.

212
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,650
In addition, Uncle Lin never asked me to return the money.

213
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:53,720
You're being shameless, do you know that?

214
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,970
Not only are you shameless, but you've also made me out to be shameless, too.

215
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,340
I tell you! If you weren't my son,

216
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,560
you'd be nothing in the eyes of others.

217
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,050
Remember this! In the future, stay away from that Uncle Lin of yours.

218
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,600
Did you hear me?

219
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,450
Got it.

220
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:00,420
Fang Wei, I don't mean to criticize you,

221
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,800
but this isn't the way to earn money.

222
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,140
You wanted to join the sales department whole-heartedly.

223
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:08,040
Did you think that all of us earned money that way?

224
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,980
Do you know how long Director Cai's project has been on hold?

225
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,140
It's all because she wants a kickback.

226
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,410
I can't agree to that.

227
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:22,040
Sister Yun,

228
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,740
I'm being used.

229
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,930
Who is using you?

230
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:30,490
Do you think you're that worth it?

231
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,730
If you don't believe me, don't talk to me.

232
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,950
I just feel bad for Director Zhou.

233
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:43,370
Do you know that from today,

234
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:47,940
Director Zhou has to report all our sales progress to Director Wei.

235
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,540
You tell me!

236
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,060
How can Director Zhou swallow this bitter pill?

237
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,030
When they asked me to be the CEO,

238
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,440
they said all the nicest things.

239
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,450
Now that they want me to leave,

240
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:03,940
each and every one of them is saying all the nastiest things.

241
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,850
Didn't you say it well at the Broad-View Forum?

242
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:13,160
"There is no shortcut in sales. Be sincere and keep your promise."

243
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,510
- Those were the words you gifted me.
- Then I'll gift you one more phrase.

244
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,860
"If someone doesn't attack me, I won't attack him, either."

245
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,130
"If someone attacks me, I will put up with it."

246
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:23,380
"If he attacks again, I'll surely counterattack."

247
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:29,960
At this stage now, I can't wait three days.

248
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,800
Tell me what you'll do.

249
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,900
I'll look for Liu Yu Fan personally.

250
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,210
What are you doing?

251
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:53,210
-I... I said to send six.
- This is what I sent.

252
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:56,660
- Who said to gift four balloons just now?
- I say we gift six balloons.

253
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,620
- How many did you send?
- Two balloons, isn't it?

254
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:03,320
Give the Royal Salute! Gift Royal Salute!
(TN: scotch whisky)!

255
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,930
- Let's gift a rocket.
- Make sure you guys keep track of the costs. Book keeping!

256
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:11,060
- What are you guys looking at?
- Director Luo.

257
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,720
President Lin is doing a live broadcast and wants us to help increase his popularity.

258
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,610
Okay, the broadcast ends here. Please remember Huikang Technology Company and Lin Zhen Wei.

259
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:20,780
Thank you "Today's Sun" for the yacht you gifted. Thanks!

260
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:25,090
- Maintain it.
- There's so many.

261
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,920
Indeed, look!

262
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,450
Also, everyone in the live broadcast are asking where to buy the fitness equipment,

263
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,460
what brand they are?

264
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,160
I feel that President Lin selling goods on his live broadcasts is more successful than others.

265
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,140
Hurry up! Help me gift that present first.

266
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,490
Hurry up! Hurry up!

267
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,260
Come over for a bit.

268
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:46,270
Director Luo, what were you looking for me for?

269
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,330
Help me investigate a person called Liu Yu Fan.

270
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:50,890
- I want to know how his company came to be.
- Okay.

271
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,560
Go and have fun.

272
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,070
- Gift the rocket.
- What did you gift?

273
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,750
No, that's wrong! What number is it now?

274
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:02,410
This equipment I'm introducing to all of you is called the Yoga Wheel.

275
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:05,390
How do you use it? It exactly for laying on the ground.

276
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,730
Then put this underneath your back.

277
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:10,330
You can lay your body down halfway or all the way.

278
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:13,710
This way, you can pull and stretch your back to the fullest extent.

279
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:17,280
In addition, you can also use this on your legs.

280
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,570
Okay! We'll end our broadcast here for today.

281
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:22,820
Everyone, please remember Huikang Technology and remember Lin Zhen Wei.

282
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,460
Thank you all for your support. Bye bye!

283
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,200
Qian Qian, you must reply to every comment.

284
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,980
Use more interjections and act cutesy with the fans.

285
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,930
Especially the one that gifted the yacht, make sure you chat well with that fan.

286
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:41,390
President Lin, Director Luo is helping you reply to your fans.

288
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,910
Wow! You can even do this.

289
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:58,270
The way you reply to my fans is very witty.

290
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:01,200
- Please wait a while, President Lin! Let me finish this reply.
- Okay.

292
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,800
President Lin,

293
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,510
- do you still remember Chairman Liu's words at He Guang Pavilion?
- Chairman Liu?

294
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,530
Allow me to introduce to all of you.

295
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:24,790
This is Huikang's gorgeous Luo Jia.

296
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:27,530
He said many things that day, which one are you referring to?

297
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,470
He said that O&T is involved in no less than ten fields.

298
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,940
Every field has sales volume of more than a hundred million yuan.

299
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,990
Do you remember it now?

300
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,550
He also said to be vigilant in times of peace.

301
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,400
I was thinking then, how we can break through each of O&T's

302
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,490
business fields to form an industrial chain.

303
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,810
It looks like I have to always take you out to see the world.

304
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,790
Of course!

305
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,510
As I was watching your live broadcast just now, I suddenly had an idea.

306
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:03,710
I'm thinking if we can present the products of these businesses

307
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,820
via video format

308
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:09,270
and display them on O&T's platform.

309
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:13,420
O&T's logistics connects the businesses and consumers.

310
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,880
This is a real connection.

311
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,750
If we were to magnify this connection...

312
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,830
Think about it!

313
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,710
Now, I understand why you're always bringing up the word "connection."

314
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,470
Hold on!

315
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,160
Du Heng isn't around right now.

316
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,150
We can only go through Old Qiu.

317
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:39,510
He's also an important person in their panel of judges.

318
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,680
I have to let you meet him.

319
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,140
Thank you, President Lin.

320
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,050
You don't have to be so polite with me.

321
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,950
I'll leave then.

322
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:07,130
Old Qiu, I'm A'Wei.

323
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,510
I heard that the results for the college entrance exams are out.

324
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:12,470
Your son did much better than you at your time.

325
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,720
I won't say congratulations.

326
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,290
However, I've prepared a gift.

327
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:19,460
I'll ask Luo Jia to bring it over.

328
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,440
Luo Jia, I know you are home.

329
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,200
Open the door.

330
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,220
Wait a minute!

331
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,270
Why are you here?

332
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,290
To see you.

333
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:19,330
I'll be here waiting.

334
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:23,400
Once you have handled everything, I'll come over.

335
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,410
Anything you should see is already seen, I'm not afraid of you seeing it.

336
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:29,130
If there is something I shouldn't see, I won't see it.

337
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:37,390
Are you setting up the rules here?

338
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:40,530
You ask! I already told you what I can tell you.

339
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,470
I want to hear things that you cannot say.

340
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:50,150
I can tell you the matter about my tie.

341
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:54,110
I went to Liu Yu Fan and almost got into a fight with him.

342
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:56,620
He burned my tie.

343
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,640
I thought that you didn't know Liu Yu Fan.

344
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,060
- I don't know him, but someone on my team does.
- Fine! You don't have to say it.

345
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,050
Anyway, I didn't hear what I want to know.

346
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:11,460
Do we still have trust between us?

347
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,880
Do you treat me as a competitor or a girlfriend?

348
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,330
As lovers.

349
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,440
Our work relationship is special.

350
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,390
It isn't good for you to know too much.

351
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:36,310
Fine! Then let's set some rules.

352
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:40,020
We don't intervene each other's business as we're rivals in the corporate world.

353
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,460
We can't only treat each other differently.

354
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,610
When we come home, we'll switch.

355
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:49,270
You don't look at my computer, and I won't look at your phone.

356
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:51,200
If you don't want to say something, I won't ask.

357
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,540
If I go out and see someone, you can just ignore me.

358
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:57,300
- Where did I put that thing?
- What?

359
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,020
What is it?

360
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,410
I'm asking you.

361
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,140
Can you do it?

362
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,720
If you can, then I can, too.

363
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:17,640
What are you looking for?

364
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,380
Don't touch my things!

365
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,630
I'm looking for my T-shirt.

366
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:30,100
Aren't you afraid you might find someone else's t-shirt?

367
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:41,050
Whose?

368
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:44,640
If you shouldn't ask, don't ask.

369
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,970
We're at home,

370
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,810
not at work.

371
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,650
- Hello?
- Director Zhou.

372
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,570
What's wrong?

373
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:42,580
What's wrong with you? What's wrong?

374
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,660
Director Zhou, I'm not going to live.

375
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:07,420
You! You... You...

376
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:10,530
- You! You!
- President Liu, I beg you.

377
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,220
President Liu, let me beg you!

378
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:15,090
Please go to our Chairman to help clarify the whole story.

379
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:18,980
You just need to tell them I didn't get any kickback. Okay

380
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,810
I beg you, I beg you!

381
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,900
Why are you begging me?

382
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,410
You are dumb and stupid.

383
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:32,340
Are you so poor?

384
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,050
Do you know how much those shoes are?

385
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:36,890
Lebron James wore that before.
(TN: Lebron James is a USA professional basketball player.)

386
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:39,430
How can you hang it like in a flea market.

387
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:44,100
Your dumb*ss, it isn't for sales.

388
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,840
President Liu, I'm giving it back to you.

389
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,560
I even washed it for you.

390
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,940
It's because Lebron James wore it, that's why it's worth a lot of money.

391
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:55,040
Once you wore it, they became garbage.

392
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,600
Can we just talk—

393
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,140
I'm sorry, President Liu.

394
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:26,080
I'll apologize on behalf of Fang Wei.

395
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,940
I'm sorry!

396
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,490
Let's go!

397
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,690
Based on what am I leaving? Are you spanking me?

398
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:34,570
Where am I going?

399
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,820
Okay.

400
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:40,850
Then we'll call the police.

401
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:43,030
Let's go to the police station together.

402
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,300
We'll let the court decide who is right and who is wrong.

403
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,420
Call what police?

404
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:50,650
I won't call the police, and you can't call them, either.

405
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:54,390
Do you want to punch him to ease your anger?

406
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,970
Punch me?

407
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:01,120
Liu Yu Fan, I'm telling you! No matter how big of your backing.

408
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,950
If you want to earn money through buy-sell

409
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:08,170
you'll be on the blacklist very soon.

410
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:11,250
You aren't just destroying your own reputation, you're destroying your family's.

411
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:14,170
When the words out, even your parents will regret giving birth to you.

412
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,430
Look at him! Look here!

413
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:21,650
He's poor and has nothing, and his life is worthless.

414
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:25,040
Your life is worth a lot more. You urged him to work with you in a desperate manner.

415
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,850
Is it worth it?

416
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:33,610
President Liu.

417
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:37,900
Now, you tell me! How would you like to handle this?

418
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,890
Okay.

419
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:44,110
How about making a clarify announcement video?

420
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:46,550
and we call it a day?

421
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:49,390
I really didn't receive a penny out of this.

422
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,450
Come! Let's go.

423
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:57,330
Let's go. Go on!

424
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:05,640
Don't let him go! Otherwise, I cannot prove my innocence—

425
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:11,540
Do you know?

426
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,360
You're a man.

427
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,770
When a man meets a problem, he needs to calm down.

428
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:22,340
If you don't calm down, no one can help you, and no one will care.

429
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:25,680
I really, really...

430
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,050
I really didn't receive a penny.

431
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:30,700
I really didn't receive a penny.

432
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,460
- I didn't get any kickback.
- Alright.

433
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,230
Okay, okay.

434
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,930
Okay!

435
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:41,750
- Excuse me! who are you looking for?
- I have an appointment with Chairman Liu Dong.

436
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:44,350
- What's your name?
- Luo Jia.

437
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,230
Come in!

438
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:10,850
- Chairman Liu, how are you?
- You are...?

439
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:12,500
I'm Luo Jia of Huikang Company.

440
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,830
- We met before.
- He Guang Pavilion?

441
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:20,670
They say that old people are forgetful, I see this isn't true.

442
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,250
Chairman Liu, she—

443
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,170
Here's what it's about, Chairman Liu.

444
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,880
Previously you said that O&T effectively connected the merchants and the consumers

445
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,470
and gained trust, so they should receive higher quality services—

446
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:43,480
Let me interrupt you!

447
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,200
How long are you going to talk?

448
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,370
I'm not finished talking.

449
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:51,040
- Can you let me finish?
- Okay.

450
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,930
But O&T hasn't been able to rise from

451
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:57,540
all the electronic platforms.

452
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:00,220
- Continue!
- Videos.

453
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:03,390
Twenty years ago, because of its capability and the limitation in the internet speed,

454
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:07,120
the internet was in an era of words and gave rise to portal sites.

455
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,630
Ten years ago, it was imaging leading to Weibo and forums breaking out.

456
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:14,160
Five years ago, it was sound, and WeChat rose.

457
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:17,150
But what is the era right now?

458
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:20,270
Right now, we're in the video age.

459
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:23,650
It'll change the entire internet field.

Using logistic data, video technology, and artificial intelligence to connect the merchants and the consumers

461
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:32,180
and to establish the new generation of super e-Commerce shopping platform.

462
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:35,830
You're good! You dare to think more than many men.

463
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:38,490
Chairman Liu, can I use your computer for a second?

464
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:42,160
so that I can demonstrate the process of a super e-Commerce shopping platform?

465
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,220
Sure! Come here.

466
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:00,810
Chairman Liu, can I sit down?

467
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:03,830
You really don't understand the pain of wearing high heels.

468
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:07,260
- That's fine.
Thank you.

469
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,980
It's ready, Chairman Liu.

470
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:23,690
Let me introduce briefly what a super shopping platform is.

477
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,200
Oh, right! Sister Jia, I've checked Liu Yu Fan's information.

478
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,770
I don't know his background,

479
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:54,900
but he has a lot of funding and has plenty of connections.

480
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,440
He has invested in many businesses

481
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,070
including Jieke's clients also.

482
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:07,060
Give me his information!

485
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:23,890
This is your son? How old is he?

486
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,950
He's almost in his thirty.

487
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:28,460
He still hasn't done anything with his life.

488
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,110
He insists on learning how to invest.

489
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:34,740
Chairman Liu's son must be talented at investing since he's your son.

490
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:37,990
Let me know if you need anything.

491

I'll really call you if I need anything.

Let's meet up!

494
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:17,600
Right now?

495
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:20,190
Yes.

496
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,490
Welcome!

497
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,590
- She's having what I'm having.
- Alright. Please wait a moment.

498
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,440
I want the same.

499
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:02,200
Why are you so formally dressed?

500
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,880
Who did you meet with?

501
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,920
Did you forget our three rules?

502
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,590
If you don't know then don't ask.

503
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:09,390
Can I say it then?

504
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,550
I want to talk to you about what is bothering me.

505
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:23,980
If I want to hear it, then you can say it.

506
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:31,520
I've met Liu Yu Fan.

507
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,910
I also understand the ins and outs of the matter, too.

508
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,240
Fang Wei wanted to increase sales for me,

509
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,270
so he got anxious.

510
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,450
I wondered about it previously.

511
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:48,690
A company that invests so many servers. Why?

512
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:51,070
Even if his subsidiary company has the need,

513
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:53,570
they still can't buy at such a large quantity.

514
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,240
Did you just learn about this matter?

515
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:03,050
What have you been doing?

516
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,910
I felt there was something wrong when I looked at the contract.

517
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:11,420
You didn't have to sign if you didn't feel right about it.

518
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,960
Fang Wei falsified my signature to sign it.

519
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,960
Enough. Don't say anymore! I really can't keep listening.

520
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:32,430
Do you believe it?

521
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:36,590
Fang Wei and I never received any gains from Liu Yu Fan.

522
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:40,830
Don't you believe me?

523
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,140
I'm the only one willing to believe it.

524
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:57,230
I've reflected upon this matter, too.

525
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:01,590
What exactly is the sales performance?

526
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:05,060
Why push people so harshly?

527
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:12,320
How do you lead your team? Tell me about it!

528
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,850
I don't have a team, so I don't have this trouble.

529
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,710
Fighting alone and you can even become the queen of sales.

530
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,450
Aren't you tired?

531
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:38,370
Haven't you heard that saying

532
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:41,520
"Single is simple, double is trouble?"

533
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,850
Single is simple, double is troublesome.

534
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,140
Isn't it the wise saying for singles?

535
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,420
Am I trouble?

536
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,950
Me.

537
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:18,320
Falling in love is troublesome.

538
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,690
However, it depends on who it is with, and whether they're willing.

539
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,320
What about with me?

540
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:34,070
Do you know whose son Liu Yu Fan is?

541
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:55,080
Hello, Liangzi.

542
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,650
I got out of my rental.

543
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:58,750
Can I make do at your place for a few days?

544
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:01,630
Haven't you taken care of that matter yet?

545
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:05,290
No. I caught that rascal Liu,

546
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:07,550
but he refused to help clarify it for me.

547
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:09,230
Director Zhou is taking the blame for me.

548
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:11,600
Same for my colleagues, too.

549
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,610
I want to cancel my lease.

550
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:15,950
I want to return the money to everyone.

551
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:18,740
Sure! It's good to wake up.

552
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,840
It's really different when you want to be an honest man.

553
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,920
Stop talking nonsense!

554
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,650
Can I stay at your house for e a few days?

555
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:29,790
Brother, you know my house's condition.

556
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:31,380
Even a monkey wouldn't have a space to seat.

557
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:34,000
Forget about living, you can't even stand.

558
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,790
Why don't I lend you some money and you can go to stay in a hotel.

559
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:38,490
Forget it!

560
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,920
I won't trouble you then.
