00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:54,440
We aren't doing this. Bring them down! Bring them all down!

173
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,020
Why are you laughing? Listen to what I said!

174
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,770
We can't just leave like this, can we?

175
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:01,160
We should do everything with a beginning and end.

176
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,690
If we leave, we should finished this first before we go.

177
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,660
Old Cao, I've been in sales for so many years.

178
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:12,440
Honestly, I've only learned how to take the blame, but never how to shift the blame.

179
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,760
Fast can lose money,

180
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,980
but we can't lose trust, can we?

181
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,700
Why are you still standing there? Come and help!

182
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:26,490
Xiao Lian! Xiao Lian!

183
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:29,800
You can pretty much take off; the drones can take off.

184
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,570
Lift off!

185
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:34,750
Xiao Lian, control! Control the height.

186
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,960
The height is the tip of the tower.

187
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,190
Control the height!

188
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,570
It's the tip of the tower. Over

189
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,160
- No signal, isn't there? Use my hot-spot.
- That one!

190
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,550
- Zhou Rui's hot-spot.
- Alright.

191
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,780
♫  Ah, ah, the story starts  ♫

192
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,120

193
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,080

- Bad boy, one word.

00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,290
Good password!

195
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,600

199
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,560
President Cui, my apology! Is it laughable?

200
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,990
Is that Zhou Rui?

201
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,760
He's from a technical background.

202
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,620
Please don't mind him!

203
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,430
♫  I am a bad boy  ♫

204
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:31,010
Xiao Lian, pay attention to controlling the distance and the height.

205
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,880
Yagi–Uda antenna, increase to 30dB.

206
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,470
♫  Tell me why, tell me why  ♫

207
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:38,020
Few of the drones are flying too fast! Slow down a bit.

208
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,620
Okay.

209
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,200
It's a little too high.

210
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,970
♫  Tell me why, tell me why  ♫

♫  Fate can't be changed?  ♫

212
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,630
Maintain it! Those drones are our temporary base station.

213
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,110
Whether we can bring the cattle home are depending on you guys, drones.

214
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:58,450
Copy! Our equipment is Yaesu brand FT-2DR, and the antenna is Diamond 711.

215
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:02,590
I can give you four watts of power with the height of the sixth floor. Over!
- Roger! Roger!

216
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:05,600
Xiao Lian, roger! Your message wasn't clear.

217
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,790
Zhou Rui, it's Xiao Lian here! The drones have connected to the signal.

218
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,800
We can move on to the next step of re-arranging the route of the cattle returning to the farm. Over!

219
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,430
Okay. Don't rush! Maintain the positions.

220
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,570
Every step has to move simultaneously. Over!

221
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,930
Got it! Got it! The software system has resumed.

222
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,510
We're moving group one closer to the cattle, and group two is ready. Over!

223
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:25,910
BG2A Roger. The Drones are ready. It'll upload the signal at anytime. Over.

224
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:29,550
The cattle have started to move. Everyone follow. Over!

00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,820

00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:58,260
Xiao Shi, I told you not to worry.

231
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,270
They're all there.

232
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:05,020
Xiao Lian, good job! Yagi–Uda antenna position is correct.

233
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,580
All the contracts from this year to last year are all here?

234
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,810
Take your time to review them! Do I need to install it for you later?

235
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,030
Can't I go to the bathroom first?

236
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:53,110
- No, I'll wait next to you.
- I can't even go to the bathroom?

237
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:55,560
President Lin, this...

238
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,870
- Give me all the keys to your drawers.
- What for?

239
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:06,810
- Let's make copies for all! I said all of it.
- Shouldn't it be like this?

240
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:08,610
Shall I give you the key to my house as well?

241
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:11,150
I've already shown you everything in the office.

242
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:14,680
The stuff in the drawers are my personal belongings, so why do I have to give them to you?

243
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,130
President Lin.

244
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,780
Every line item on the report has to be accurate and precise.

245
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:22,260
If you don't cooperate, it'll affect the acquisition price, can you handle that responsibility?

246
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:25,530
Alright, alright. Go ahead and go through everything!

247
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,140
Chairman Liu, you admitted that you increased the estimate,

248
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,760
we agreed this is part of the due diligence.

249
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,480
What's with this sudden attack?

250
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,990
No wait! Why are you going over this with me?

251
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:40,200
You're even following people. Is this due diligence? It's arresting criminals!

252
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,770
Are you scared because you did something dubious?

253
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:46,770
I invited a third-party professional to prepare this specialized report.

254
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,250
I don't want any irresponsible remarks.

255
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:53,270
Then you should withdraw the third-party due diligence staff and give me time to re-do—

256
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,870
We're—

257
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,140
[Herd Position]
[Herd Temperature]

258
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,870
Why are you back again?

259
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:20,010
I'm here to get the computer, I need my data.

260
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,010
What do you mean?

261
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,750
If you beg me, I might be able to explain everything to President Cui.

262
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:33,250
Director Zhou, please! I beg you!

263
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,950
I beg you! Let's go! Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up!

264
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,480
Come, come, come. Get down!

265
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,890
President Cui.

266
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,220
- This is—
- Zhou Rui, isn't he?

267
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,460
Yes, yes, yes.

268
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,560
- This is President Cui from Sanke Group.
- How do you do? I'm Zhou Rui.

269
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,160
In order to meet you, I've been chasing after you across three quarters of China.

270
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,570
Don't blame me! It's he who doesn't want you to meet me, isn't it?

271
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:58,490
- No! No! It isn't true!
- I told Jieke twice

272
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:01,600
that I wanted you to participate in our bidding project.

273
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,520
However, they weren't responsive.

274
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,160
You're very difficult to invite.

275
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,550
Are you referring to Sanke's Smart Water System?

276
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,590
Isn't it obvious?

277
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,730
It's a big project that's worth 150 million yuan.

278
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,630
I've seen Sanke's bidding request.

279
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,790
It's going for a traditional route.

280
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,650
Right now, I'm only doing cloud technology.

281
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:23,990
It wouldn't fit your bidding requirements.

282
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:30,750
You just used drones to set up a temporary base station.

283
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,640
- That's right.
- Yes.

284
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,450
To be honest, what I have my eye on is your crisis management abilities.

285
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:38,560
Those who do government projects aren't afraid of problems,

286
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:42,230
but what we're afraid of is once there is an issue, we can't correct it in time.

287
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:46,120
Right now, Huikang's representative is Luo Jia, and Jieke's representative is Feng Wei.

288
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,030
However generally, it's as you said, a traditional route.

289
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:54,380
To be honest, I know our missing link is you.

290
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:58,020
If Sanke doesn't change your bidding requirements,

291
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,950
then our cloud technology won't be able to enter the bid.

292
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,050
Then make it a test bid.

293
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,550
- Test bid?
- Yes. A test bid.

294
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:09,370
It gives everyone an opportunity to prove their ability.

295
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:13,440
No matter if it is cloud technology or rain technology, as long as it works and is effective,

296
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,520
they'll be Sanke's hidden Party B.

297
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,820
That's right! Right.

298
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:23,540
Then Old Cao, after we gather all the cattle back, let's go back to Beijing.

299
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,290
- Alright.
- Good.

300
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,520
- I'll wait for you in Beijing.
- Alright. Thanks!

301
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,620
- I'll walk President Cui out.
- Okay.

302
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,290
- Come! This way.
- Come!

303
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:35,480
Okay!

304
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:54,530
Sister Gu, you saw our company's Information management system.

305
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:56,140
The number doesn't look right.

306
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:59,860
I signed all the previous contracts, so I know them more or less.

307
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:04,360
Why has the price of this system doubled?

308
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,430
You can simply ask President Lin.

309
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,480
There's no need to force me to tell you the truth.

310
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,790
I already told you, I'm currently on vacation.

311
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:15,260
I don't need to answer your questions.

312
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:19,440
Is it that difficult to tell me the truth?

313
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:25,390
Let me tell you, Luo Jia! I'm no longer managing this matter.

314
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,810
Also, before I left, the contract was handed over to the executive department.

315
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,120
How they enter the numbers into the database, I wouldn't know.

316
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,920
Why don't you ask them?

317
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:47,190
The system was updated before I left.

318
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:49,690
Can I see the previous version?

319
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:53,630
Director Luo, when I left, I got a big severance agreement.

320
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:56,040
I also signed the non-disclosure agreement.

321
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,920
I can only tell you one thing.

322
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,890
Only President Lin has the password for the system reboot.

323
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,760
Sister! Sister!

324
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,550
Don't tell me! I know already.

325
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:23,160
- President Lin asked me not to go back to the office.
- No! No! No!

326
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,030
Things have been flipped upside down.

327
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:29,880
- They stop the due diligence?
- No. Sanke Company changed the bidding requirements.

328
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,520
They're allowing all corporations to join the bid.

329
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,660
Why?

330
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,970
It's because Zhou Rui has come back.

331
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:42,320
This time, for Fang Wei to get Sanke,

332
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,410
to be honest, left me pretty surprised, too.

333
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:51,910
No matter what, to the company,

334
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:55,140
this is an excellent opportunity to do something big and strong.

335
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,840
Chairman Li, you are the last one we're waiting for.

336
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,960
- Let's begin.
- Don't rush!

337
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,640
Not everyone is here yet.

338
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,700
I'd like to introduce someone to everyone first.

339
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,150
This is Ms. Wei Tian Ming.

340
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,820
I'm sure everyone is familiar with her name.

341
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:25,020
All this time, I've been representing her shares.

342
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,100
Sister Wei, say a few words, please!

343
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:34,780
Sorry! This is the first time that I'm meeting all of you.

344
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,550
Go ahead and make the announcement.

345
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,160
Okay.

346
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:45,340
Everyone, according to Ms. Wei Tian Ming's own decisions,

347
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,830
she is willing to take the 12% of her shares

348
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,440
in Jieke Technology Company

349
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,650
and transfer them unconditionally to Zhou Rui.

350
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:02,990
Here! We'll let everyone here sign on the announcement.

351
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:06,060
I'll say a few words first.

352
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,860
Wei Tian Ming,

353
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:12,980
how long have you planned this matter with Zhou Rui?

354
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,260
Let me also ask you,

355
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,300
when we meet later,

356
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,900
will he move the chair for me?

357
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,490
Or, will I have to move the chair for him?

358
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,470
You don't need to answer it.

359
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:29,550
It also means that Director Zhou,

360
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:33,670
now, represents Fast Technology,

361
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:36,660
and he can also represent Jieke.

362
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:39,040
He can even...

363
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,660
align with Huikang.

364
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,210
Before this battle has even started,

365
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:51,430
we've already lost.

366
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,340
Is that right?

367
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:07,070
Sorry! I can't sign this today.

368
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:12,700
President Chen, according to the Concerted Action Agreement from back then,

369
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,160
the shares that Ms. Wei Tian Ming holds

370
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,520
can be transferred voluntarily,

371
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,180
without the need to get agreement from the other shareholders'.

372
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:23,270
Signing the signature is just a formality.

373
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,990
If you insist on doing it this way,

374
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,980
[Contract of Agreement]

375
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,090
I just quit.

376
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:55,230
Everyone, Zhou Rui will represent Jieke and Fast Technology

377
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:58,290
to join Sanke project bid.

378
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,930
In order to maintain unity of power, I recommend

379
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:05,330
letting Zhou Rui take over the position of CEO at Jieke.

380
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:51,850
Du Heng, let me ask you one last question.

381
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:55,840
- How much do you know about the acquisition?
- I know everything.

382
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,930
All the information from your company's due diligence ultimately will be sent to me.

383
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,790
Can you talk about it?

384
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:08,330
My cellphone is here.

385
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,650
I don't have recording devices on me.

386
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:31,720
Du Heng, I only want to know how deeply I've fallen,

387
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,850
and can I still get out?

388
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:36,480
I think we should temporarily break up.

389
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:40,300
Break up? And even temporarily?

390
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:44,310
At least, wait until this acquisition is complete or is canceled.

391
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:47,230
Du Heng you're joking, aren't you?

392
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:51,950
Are you discussing our relationship right now?

393
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:55,030
It isn't an appropriate time to talk about feelings.

394
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,620
No, wait! In your heart,

395
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,460
O&T is more important than my safety, isn't it?

396
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,390
You don't understand anything.

397
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,840
If you receive favors from someone, then you should do a good job.

398
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,260
This matter isn't important to you,

399
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,980
but it's more important to me.

400
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:22,210
Du Heng, let me tell you! A break up is a just break up.

401
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:24,200
There's nothing temporary.

402
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:30,120
Breaking up means we won't see each other again. Never!

403
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,470
Our life will be like there was never any interaction.

404
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,790
That's breaking up!

405
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,800
I understand.

406
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,870
I have nothing more to say.

407
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:43,750
You said it more clearly than I did.

408
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:46,340
I accept it.

409
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:51,040
Try to minimize the pain as much as possible, won't you?

410
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,290
But as for a solution, you can think about that yourself.

411
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:28,620
Go to find Zhou Rui. He can help you.

412
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,370
Get lost!

413
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:40,160
The probability of failure for the cochlear surgery is very low.

414
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,930
But unfortunately for Duo Duo,

415
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,770
she probably won't ever hear again.

416
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:51,130
Sorry! We did try our best.

417
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:40,190
Director Wei, please show me a way!

418
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,380
This...

419
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:46,080
When do I drink black tea, and when is it green tea?

420
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,880
Here!

421
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,550
Let's have a toast!

422
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:05,050
Director Wei, please have a good journey.

423
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:07,390
Cui Long is here to bow to you.

424
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,940
Bei Yao Yao also bows to you.

00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:24,030
Wifey, look! The weather is particularly good today.

428
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,710
Look at how green the ground is!

429
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:27,950
Cui Long? C-Cui Long is here.

430
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,340
Where did all these kids come from?

431
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:33,500
Brother Lei? Where is Brother Lei? Brother Lei.

432
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:37,810
- You're here! How is Xiao Yun?
- Xiao Yun can't come.

433
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:39,550
I'm doing this for her.

434
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,430
- I'm video calling her.
- Okay. Go on! Go on!

435
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,970
- I'm going to let her take a look first.
- Okay.

436
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:48,190
Can you turn it around?

437
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:50,650
Let me say a few words to Director Wei.

438
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:53,620
Here's Director Wei! Director Wei left with a smile.

439
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,650
I heard before...

440
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:25,290
as long as you can say two things,

441
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:28,150
then you'll know if you can go to heaven.

442
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:34,090
The first is, were you ever happy?

443
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:40,110
The second is, did you make others happy?

444
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:47,890
I don't know your answer.

445
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,880
I think...

446
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,790
I'm more likely than you to go to heaven.

447
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:02,010
Where you go isn't important.

448
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:11,280
You won't be forgotten.

449
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:19,350
You're alive in many people's hearts.

450
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,080
Not far away.

451
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,990
Not far away.

452
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:54,550
Don't go in! I've picked him up already.

453
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:01,010
I'm at fault for his death.

454
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:09,920
I'm at fault, too.

455
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,840
It's enough that you know in your heart.

[Those Who Go to Bed Early and Rise Early Are Blessed]

457
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:45,270
A glass of water.

458
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,940
Did you see your mentor?

459
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,000
I did.

460
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:01,640
Sister Wei, I came...

461
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,610
to ask you the reason why.

462
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:06,980
You're here to refuse me.

463
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:12,720
If this were a year ago, when I first came, I would've accepted it willingly.

464
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,940
But today...

465
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,220
For Jieke to be where it is today, your master's contribution is irrefutable.

466
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:31,530
However, your master is also responsible for Jieke's decline.

467
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:34,350
The company needs someone to take it over.

468
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:39,870
Anyone can take it over, but I can't.

469
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:44,780
If I take it, I'll be carrying a word on my back forever,

470
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,850
the word "usurper" as in usurping the throne.

471
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,500
I really didn't expect that.

472
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,150
I've always thought, it's sales.

473
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:03,530
Isn't the ultimate goal the profit?

474
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:05,570
Today's sales isn't that anymore.

475
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:09,400
Sales nowadays is about connections as everything connects in the world.

476
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,680
Ultimately, what's connected are human hearts.

477
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:25,000
But it's harder to win people's hearts than to gain profit.

478
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:33,620
Sister Wei!

479
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:37,260
Sister Wei, Old Wu and I still have something to do.

480
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,480
- We'll get going now.
- Okay. Come again next time.

481
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,570
- Okay.
- Thanks.

482
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:42,720
- See you next time.
- Goodbye.

483
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:54,780
But your master will never understand this reasoning.

484
00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:00,930
What's aging him isn't age, but his mental state.

485
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,020
I waited thirty years for him

486
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,830
in the name of love.

487
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:15,100
I know that this move is pretty hard on him.

488
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:22,320
However, I'm actually even harder on myself.

489
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:30,160
It isn't that I can't resurrect Jieke,

490
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,500
but this isn't my destined mission anymore.

491
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,910
Each generation will do what they'll do.

492
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:49,790

493
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:53,710
no matter what happens, you'll let me come back within a month.

494
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:57,240
I swear.

496
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:07,110
You and Liu Yu Fan planned a long time ago to send me away, didn't you?

497
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,170
Is that important?

498
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,720
It's important.

499
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:16,080
But now, you aren't important to him anymore.

500
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:20,300
Those things you can't catch, it's better to say farewell to.

What do you want to do?

00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,030
Call the police?

506
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:37,660
If he's imprisoned, will you go with him?

507
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:49,840
- Hello.
- President Du.

508
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:54,770
You can send Liu Yu Fan away, and I can hide Zhao Ying.

509
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:59,880
At the crucial moment, even if you let Zhao Ying die, it's got nothing to do with me.

510
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,730
Why wouldn't it have anything to do with you?

511
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:04,870
She and Liu Yu Fan are married, so she is already a member of the Liu family.

512
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:08,950
A young woman with a nine-figure amount in her hand.

513
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:11,200
She'll live a better life than all of you.

514
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,430
Lin Zhen Wei, let me tell you,

515
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,570
no matter how adept someone is, they still have a past.

516
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:23,720
I'll send you to prison. Get it?

517
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,540
Liu Feng and Luo Jia will be there to keep me company.

518
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:30,230
- We'll be waiting for you inside.

519
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,150
[Zhao Ying]

520
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:37,230
[Zhao Ying]

521
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,030
The subscriber you dialed has turned off the phone, it cannot be connected temporarily.

522
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,530
You can leave a message after the beep.

523
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,020
Director Luo, you actually have idle time to read?

524
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:31,220
Didn't you ask someone to tell me not to return to the office?

525
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:41,250
President Lin.

526
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:45,690
I've been in Huikang for seven years, haven't I?

527
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,540
It's true! Huikang is like my home.

528
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,470
In the office,

529
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:57,260
I can tell what extra things there are even with my eyes closed.

530
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:56,970
But now, you tell me not to go back to the office.

531
00:40:56,970 --> 00:41:00,150
I just want to ask you, why is it exactly?

532
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:03,910
Luo Jia, I know that you've been asking around.

533
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:06,310
But no matter what you hear,

534
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,400
you should remember what I said.

535
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,550
You and I are in the same boat.

536
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,640
Seven years.

537
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:23,690
I thought I already proved my loyalty and capability

538
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:26,600
with my time and sales performance.

539
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,890
But it looks like everything was just a joke.

540
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:34,410
A total joke.

541
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,860
What do you mean?

542
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:41,650
Loyalty isn't important.

543
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:43,510
I'm not important, either.

544
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,190
Luo Jia, can't you be so emotional?

545
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:51,060
Training soldiers for a thousand days to use them for one moment.

546
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,360
You should know this saying, shouldn't you?

547
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:57,030
Right now, to Huikang, Sanke's project is more important.

548
00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:01,440
It's exactly your way of doing things that made you lose the Sanke project.

549
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,620
- I won't be able to win this time.
- You must win.

550
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:08,490
As long as Huikang can complete the acquisition with the estimated value of 350 million,

551
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:10,380
then everything will be like after the rain.

552
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,860
The sun will shine, the wind will be gentle, and the clouds will be light.

553
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:16,930
I said that I won't win because I don't want to win anymore.

554
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,540
What do you really want?

555
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,330
I can't win, President Lin.

556
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:33,940
I used to fight so hard to win, because you trusted me.

557
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:37,330
Now that you are starting to frame me,

558
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:39,680
I'll make you lose.

559
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:46,840
You're the only one who will lose, Luo Jia.

560
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,230
I won't lose.

561
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:54,040
You know? What you're losing isn't just a project.

562
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:58,270
What you're losing is your future, your life.

563
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,510
You're saying that I'm going to be in prison, aren't you?

564
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,660
However, you will as well.

565
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,360
Not only will you not get 350 million,

566
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,190
you'll also sit in prison.

567
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:19,750
Luo Jia!

❝ One Half ❞ by Mo Fei Ding Lu

00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:38,470
♫  The sun has only shone halfway  ♫

570
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:44,130
♫  The freckles on my face are bright and dark  ♫

571
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:47,110
♫  Oh...  ♫

572
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:52,540
♫  Who sung the song halfway through  ♫

573
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:58,360
♫  Leaving behind the roars of the chorus in an empty room  ♫

574
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,360
♫  I...  ♫

575
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:08,300
♫  Slowly tidied up the embarrassment of the dispersing crowd  ♫

576
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:16,300
♫  Who would abruptly break off the lingering care of the past?  ♫

577
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:19,060
♫  You deserved it, someone said  ♫

578
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:30,350
♫  It would be for the best that the story stays unfinished  ♫

579
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:37,090
♫  Those words were spoken halfway  ♫

580
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:40,970
♫  When those few words reached the tip of the tongue  ♫

581
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:44,470
♫  It would take several years to accept  ♫

582
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:51,240
♫  Whose heart is closed midway from now on  ♫

583
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:58,710
♫  Locking up all the endless insomnia in the past?  ♫

584
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:05,290
♫  Some words are only spoken halfway  ♫

585
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:09,260
♫  To adjust the emotional intensity afterwards  ♫

586
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:12,770
♫  Just air-dry it slowly with time  ♫

587
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:19,390
♫  Whose heart will miss a half from now on  ♫

588
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:21,390
♫  Just let it totally submerge  ♫

589
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:28,090
♫  My remaining dimness  ♫

590
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:34,230
♫  The other half  ♫

591
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:40,730
♫  The other half  ♫

592
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:48,110
♫  The other half  ♫
