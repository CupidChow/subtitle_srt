Did you forget the passcode?

25

Isn't it safer if I forgot it?

26

You came at the perfect moment.

27
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,060
I need to ask you for a favor.

28

I need a favor from you as well.

- Are you going to get off me or not?
- No.

I told you to let go!

It hurts.

37
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,260
H-hurts? If it hurts, then why didn't you let go?

38
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,590
Enough! I really need your help with something.

It's for a meeting. This is too casual.

44
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,120
Why is the collar so low?

Your jealousy is quite strong.

Why are you looking at me?

51
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,370
I'm admiring you.

52
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,270
Am I that beautiful?

53
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,260
Say! I pulled out your judges

54
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,060
and even asked you to come pick things out for me.

55
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,890
Are you trying to make me feel guilty?

56
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,380
Do you feel guilty?

57
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:04,310

You scared me!

62
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,520
Why are you still at the company at this hour?

63
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,610
I now realize that

64
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:51,000
the work of the administrative department is too trivial.

65
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,270
No.

66
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,060
I have an opposing opinion.

67
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,750
Only now, I feel that sales is difficult.

68
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,550
Money is hard to earn, dirt is hard to eat.

69
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,680
You're now following Zhou Rui

70
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,910
because you're lucky.

71
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,330
I know.

72
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,730
I'll return the favor that I owe him.

73
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:24,330
However, to be honest,

74
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:27,060
I don't want him to help me every time.

75
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,810
Why is it that you still don't know how to appreciate what you have?

76
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,810
I'd rather the company punishes me.

77
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:39,030
This is what I deserve.

78
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:44,010
It's better than shrinking my neck and running with my tail between my legs.

79
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,400
I'll be candid with you.

80

Tell me!

88

When will we ever stop competing with each other?

89
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:01,700

Even if they are difficult to deal with, haven't you already dealt with me?

Even if I look at them, I'm looking at Huikang's own things. Okay?

164
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,080
Right now, it isn't Huikang's yet.

165
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,830
Not yet!

166
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,040
Okay, Chairman Li. I'll cooperate.

167
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,820
Master!

168
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,130
What do you want?

169
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:57,250
Huikang suddenly sent people to do due diligence. What's it about?

170
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,760
I just found out, too.

171
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,620
Lin Zhen Wei directly went to Chairman Li to discuss it.

172
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:09,140
There's no problem with the due diligence if it's Legal or Finance departments, but not with me.

173
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,390
Before we're acquired, Huikang and we are still competitors.

174
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:15,500
Our core information in the Sales Department must not be exposed.

175
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,150
Besides, we're still in the preliminary stage of bidding.

176
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,990
- Take a look here.
- Look at this! This due diligence template was done by us at Jieke.

177
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:30,300
These contracts were signed during last season.

178
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,100
Take a look!

179
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,920
All of my things are here.

180
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,380
Lin Zhen Wei anxiously rushing over here at this time,

181
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:01,880
it's obviously means that he doesn't want us to join the bidding.

182
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:08,900
I... I don't think I'll withdraw.

183
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:13,470
To me, this is a battle for honor.

184
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,790
His moves are on well-founded basis.

185
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:21,120
Win or lose, it's the same result.

186
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,990
We'll be acquired.

187
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,040
I've already asked President Chen.

188
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,040
He says to follow the process.

189
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,090
We'll first look at Legal, and then Finance.

190
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:13,090
However, for the Sales Department, I really can't cooperate for now.

191
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,580
What's meant to happen will eventually happen.

192
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,400
What are you going to do?

193
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:36,250
Why is it that I'm actually a little pleased?

194
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:38,390
Why?

195
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:41,790
It's because we're no longer competitors.

196
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,990
We can make our relationship public.

197
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,270
Okay.

198
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:02,260
Then you should truthfully, objectively, wholly, and completely fulfill the duty

199
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:05,950
to disclose the information and cooperate with my questioning.

200
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,590
You weren't on the due diligence team, were you?

201
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,500
Did you ask to be here?

202
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,370
That's right.

203
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:17,690
I just want to see you sitting in front of me

204
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:21,300
answering every question carefully and cautiously.

205
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:27,850
I can only be like this in front of you, can't I?

206
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,410
Zhou Rui,

207
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,840
Jieke getting acquired doesn't result in any personal losses for you.

208
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:42,980
When you withdraw from this bidding,

209
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,650
the whole world will clear up.

210
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:50,600
I've really had enough of the days where I had to point a gun at my opponents.

211
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,880
It's one thing to have the gun pointing to my head,

212
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,180
I'm only afraid that the trigger will be pulled.

213
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,420
Then you can lift up your gun by an inch.

214
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:06,470
Unless the rules change one day,

215
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,740
when the competition turns into a win-win,

216
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,430
and when self-interest becomes altruism.

217
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,230
You're right.

218
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:26,650
The predecessors plant the trees while the later generations enjoy the shade.

219
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:31,250
Those who change the rules will die silently.

220
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,110
As long as you remember me,

221
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,770
then it's fine.

222
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:46,870
Your chair is too uncomfortable.

223
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,850
You get tired if you sit in it for too long; you should get a new one.

224
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,830
Everyone, come here!

225
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,480
Come here.

226
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:24,000
This time, I won't

227
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:26,470
be acting dictatorially.

228
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:29,480
I want to hear each of your opinions.

229
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,450
After the wheel warfare, our stakes have been completely laid out at O&T.
 (TN: Taking turns to wear the enemy down)

230
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:38,400
Strictly speaking, we're ready for the battle.

231
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:44,240
However, we can still choose to withdraw.

232
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,300
Withdraw?

233
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:50,470
Can you tell us why?

234
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:53,530
I believe you've all heard already.

235
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,580
We're really going to be acquired this time.

236
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:00,120
So if we win, the profit belongs to Huikang.

237
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:04,670
If we lose, Huikang still won't suffer any losses.

238
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:10,110
Director Zhou, we aren't satisfied.

239
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:15,040
I think it's too cowardly to withdraw right before the battle.

240
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:21,110
Okay then, let's vote by raising our hands!

241
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:24,620
Those who agree to withdrawing, raise your hand.

242
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,640
Those who agree to fight, raise your hand.

243
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:04,110
Okay. That's great! Thanks.

244
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:11,680
Are there other wineries around here?

245
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,870
Are there other wineries around here?

246
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,330
Tian Ming.

247
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:30,070
I won't be eating at home as I'm going to the company.

248
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:32,920
Don't be like that! I've already prepared everything.

249
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,460
Can't you do it yourself for once?

250
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,680
Don't I still have you?

251
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,380
I need to go to Munich to get some wine.

252
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:47,340
I'll also have a look around Nymphenburg Palace and Marienplatz while I'm there.

253
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,050
Don't do that! It'll easily create wrinkles that way.

254
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:58,290
The European Championship has a game in the Allianze Stadium this Saturday.

255
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:00,640
I reserved two business-class tickets.

256
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:04,650
We'll be on Thursday's flight on Munich Airlines.

257
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,370
Direct flight, this way, there won't be any hardships.

258
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:09,470
When it gets to Friday, you'll be able to rest for a bit.

259
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:14,660
This is the most crucial time for the bidding on the Super E-Commerce platform.

260
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:18,620
The soldiers under me are fighting for their lives while the general sneaks away.

261
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,110
This doesn't look good, does it?

262
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:24,360
Take this one off and change to a lighter colored one.

263
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,960
At this age, you'll have to rely on color to hide things.

264
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,730
Younger people like wearing darker colors because they want to look more mature.

265
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:33,070
You should wear lighter colored clothes to look more energetic.

266
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:35,940
I won't be eating here anymore; I'll eat on my way there.

267
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:40,390
- I'll look for you at the bar in the evening.
- You leave first.

268
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:43,490
After booking the flights, I'll head to the bar.

269
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,050
Let me repeat myself.

270
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:53,380
I can't go.

271
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:19,250
Huikang Company's Wang Yi Nan.

272
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,860
Hello, I'm Huikang's Wang Yi Nan.

273
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,740
Your room is on the second floor of the west building.

274
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,210
Huikang Company's Kong Le Le.

275
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,030
I'll get going first.

276
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,680
I'm coming.

277
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,100
Your room is on the second floor on the west side of the building.

278
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,630
Thanks.

279
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,680
Jieke's Fang Wei.

280
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,400
Where is Fang Wei? Fang Wei!

281
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,510
Here, here, here!

282
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:45,140
Your room is on the second floor of the east building.

283
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,600
My card is broken.

284
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,890
Is Jieke's Cui Long here?

285
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,140
Is Cui Long here?

286
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,190
Cui Long didn't come.

287
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:55,110
- I-I'll go in first. Thanks!
- It's okay now.

288
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:58,410
- Bei Yao Yao! Are you Jieke's Bei Yao Yao?
- Okay.

289
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:00,090
This is the card for your room.

290
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:03,040
- Your room is on the second floor of the east building.
- Thanks.

291
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:07,310
Li Bei Jian. Jieke's Li Bei Jian.

292
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,620
How did I end up falling asleep yesterday?

293
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,040
I didn't even know when you left.

294
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:27,840
When I went back, Grandma wasn't asleep yet.

295
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,270
Stop it, will you? Just admit it if you're afraid.

296
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,070
You're the one who's scared, okay?

297
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:44,530
Or you're not afraid of anything?

298
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,160
Let go of me! Let go!

299
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,600
Fine. Just you wait!

300
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,950
There will come a day when you'll be scared.

301
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,120
What are you doing sneaking around?

302
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,460
Not so hard! If you scare someone to death, you'll have to repay with your life.

303
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:32,520
I heard we're in the same room.

304
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,960
Yes. What do you want?

305
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,310
Do you snore when you sleep?

306
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,590
What are you doing?

307
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:41,240
Did you really think I'd share a room with you?

308
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,390
What are you doing?

309
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:49,530
- What is it?
- What are you doing? Let go!

310
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:53,400
- What do you mean by this?
- Pepper spray.

311
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,970
Cui Long, who are you guarding against?

312
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:58,910
Guarding against you.

313
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:02,230
- What is the meaning of this?
- Go ahead and guard then.

314
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:09,130
Little guy!

315
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:11,450
- Let's have some coffee!

316
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:12,890
- Let's not to.
- Let's not drink it.

317
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,570
- None of you are drinking? How about this?
- No.

318
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:16,170
Let's have some drink tonight, okay?

319
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:19,150
I'll bring the wine, you guys just bring the people. Okay? See you tonight!

320
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:21,660
- Okay, bye.
- Okay, okay. See you tonight!

321
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,340
Director Zhou.

322
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,290
Why are you here?

323
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:43,250
I came here to bid.

324
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:49,350
- What did you say?
- What?

325
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:53,330
Only Zhou Rui is allowed to set a fire, but I can't be allowed to light a lamp?

326
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:57,000
- How are you qualified to submit a bid?
- How am I qualified?

327
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:02,220
Of course, it's with our cloud computing.

328
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,200
Old Cao, did water enter your brain or did you get kicked in the head by a donkey?
 (TN: meaning something wrong with your brain)

329
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,600
Jieke and Fast aren't officially collaborating yet.

330
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,200
You don't even have the right to use the software system that we're currently developing for the bid.

331
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,000
Do you understand?

332
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,600
I'm already here, and I've just submitted the bid document.

333
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,500
- Old Cao—
- Let me tell you!

334
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,000
Once I get the bid, I'll be qualified.

335
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,400
Old Cao!

336
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:38,590
The cloud processing technology still isn't mature right now.

337
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,000
It's still far from being pushed into the market.

338
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,200
Why is it so hard to deal with you tech guys?

339
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,200
Why are there so many rules?

340
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,200
Old Cao,

341
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,200
actually, I just need a little bit more time.

342
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,600
And you! You also need to have a little more patience. That's it!

343
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,200
What is time?

344
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,300
Time is money.

345
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,800
Money?

346
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,800
Money! Money! You're always mentioning money.

347
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,200
Don't you forget what you once told me.

348
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,800
You want to do something big. Something big!

349
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,400
Do you know?

350
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,600
Whenever I close my eyes every day,

351
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,200
the capital chain is breaking.

352
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,800
Breaking, breaking, and breaking again!

353
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,400
If I still don't see a return on capital,

354
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,400
not to mention doing something big, it'll turn into big trouble.

355
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,000
- Old Cao—
- I don't care.

356
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,200
Zhou Rui, even if it's a fire pit, you'll have to jump in with me.

357
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,000
Old Cao!

358
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,200
The contract that you signed is still in my briefcase.

359
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,100
Bye! Bye!

360
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,790
Director Luo, no matter how I calculate it,

361
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:03,600
to be on the safe side,

362
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,600
we should still request for another reduction from the company.

363
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,700
No need!

364
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:18,000
The current bidding rule has eliminated the requirement to take the lowest bid.

365
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,300
Furthermore, O&T isn't looking for the lowest bidder this time.

366
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:28,300
We only need to maintain an average price with the other five suppliers.

367
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,100
Director Luo, Jieke has conceded already,

368
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,700
why are they still making trouble?

369
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,400
Jieke has conceded, but Zhou Rui hasn't.

370
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,400
Jieke and Zhou Rui are two separate matters.

371
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,400
We only need to keep an eye on two points.

372
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,700
Client, opponent, and opponent, and client.

373
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,200
- Look at this information.
- I understand now.

374
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,800
Jieke's Zhou Rui is our opponent again this time?

375
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,800
By the way, how did that chicken soup saying go?

376
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,000
"Our opponent is always ourselves."

377
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,890
That's why, Xiao Le,

378
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:11,800
Director Luo personally participated in setting up the bid document.

379
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,400
Do you think there is still an opponent?

380
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,200
Enough. Don't talk about it anymore!

381
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:20,000
We can't take the other suppliers lightly, either.

382
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,800
It's pretty good! Director Luo is probably certain to win, isn't she?

383
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,000
Old Cao's Fast was able to get in this time.

384
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,400
Don't you find it interesting?

385
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,400
Up! Up! Up!

386
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,500
Up! Up! Up! Up!Yes!

387
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,800
Up! Up! Up! Come on!

388
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,700
- First blood!
- You have been slain.

389
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,980
This person's blocking is bad.

390
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,200
What are you waiting for?

391
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:20,410
- What the heck? Up! Up! Up already!
- An ally has been slain!

392
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,200
- Do you even know how to block?
- An ally has been slain!

393
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,600
What's your ranking? Come on, Sister! Let's play a game.

394
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,600
Are you qualified to?

395
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,000
The monkey's finances aren't going up.

396
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,500
I'm not qualified.

397
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,400
- What's our relationship?
- What do you think?

398
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:56,520
Why don't I help you recall the memories?

399
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,400
Sure! Let's recall them.

400
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,400
What game are you playing?

401
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,400
Recalling the memories then!

402
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:15,000
Cui Long, didn't you want to know why I carry pepper spray?

403
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,100
I was just joking.

404
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,980
Have you been bullied before?

405
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:23,000
Do you know what it feels like to be bullied?

406
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,100
No, no, no! No, don't!

407
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,590
No, don't! I was wrong! I was wrong!

408
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:29,200
I was wrong! I was wrong!

409
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,400
Cui Long, if you're bored,

410
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,640
do something serious, okay?

411
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,000
Speak!

412
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,900
Speak!

413
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,800
Okay. Okay.

414
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,600
Isn't that President Cao something?

415
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,100
He's suddenly transformed to

416
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,100
be on equal lineup with us.

417
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
He's playing the cloud computing technology card this time.

418
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,200
It's a totally different play from our traditional servers.

419
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,000
Then this scammer might just be a dark horse then.

420
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,400
Touch wood! Don't jinx it!

421
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,800
Director Zhou, are we still targeting Huikang?

422
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,430
Before we get into the price negotiation segment,

423
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:26,100
all the four other companies are our opponents.

424
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,400
Boss, let me confirm again with you.

425
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:33,000
Our bottom line is definitely lower by ten million than before, isn't it?

426
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,800
I'll explain it to you later.

427
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,800
Fang Wei,

428
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,600
tomorrow, you go on site with me.

429
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,220
Sure!

430
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,950
Let me break it down for you!

431
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,600
In the aspect of business,

432
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:51,000
Huikang has the biggest advantage among the five bidders.

433
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,100
Regarding technology, we have the biggest advantage.

434
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,400
However, regarding human connections,

435
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,490
Huikang is still the one with more advantage.

436
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:09,200
That's why you think we need to lower it by another ten million, isn't it?

437
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,800
Yes.

438
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,100
But there's still a risk.

439
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:18,800
The way I see it, our chances of winning aren't all that high.

440
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:24,540
Why didn't Cui Long come with you all?

441
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,900
Why are looking at me? Who is Cui Long to me?

442
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,800
Everyone, remember this!

443
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,100
Tomorrow might very likely be

444
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:44,300
your last battle working for Jieke.

445
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,980
Fight for honor.

446
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,700
Even if we're defeated,

447
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,300
we still must fail with honor.

448
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,900
Okay.

449
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,800
Has everyone had enough?

450
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,800
Get ready then.

451
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,900
Let's go! Get ready.

452
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:14,800
Young Master Cui, it's rare to see you coming to inspect the work.

453
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,000
Who is inspecting the work?

454
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,100
I came seriously to do work.

455
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:23,100
How about this then? I'll tell the front desk to give you a suite.

456
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:26,000
No need! Let's keep a low profile.

457
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,400
Young Master, then do you have any other orders?

458
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,400
Oh yes, do you see that room?

459
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,320
Give me the key card to that room!

460
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,300
Then get me an employee badge for Huikang.

461
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,800
- Okay?
- Okay.

462
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,500
You can go now.

00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,400
♫  To adjust the emotional intensity afterwards  ♫

481
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,800
♫  Just air-dry it slowly with time  ♫

482
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:42,600
♫  Whose heart will miss a half from now on  ♫

483
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,800
♫  Just let it totally submerge  ♫

484
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:50,900
♫  My remaining dimness  ♫

485
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:57,100
♫  The other half  ♫

486
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:04,000
♫  The other half  ♫

487
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,200
♫  The other half  ♫
