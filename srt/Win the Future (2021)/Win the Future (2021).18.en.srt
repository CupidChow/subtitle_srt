22
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,510
You brought everything including all the data, didn't you?

23
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,050
Director Zhou, I'm at the airport.

24
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,750
Luo Jia, Wang Yi Nan, and their team already went in.

25
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:24,040
It seems like Huikang's marketing department really turned out in full strength.

26
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,440
The airplane will take off soon.

27
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,330
Quickly explain to me the basic situation with these companies.

28
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,990
Also, which of these can we directly speak to policymakers?

29
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,890
I already connected with the first one, Hengguang Technology.

30
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,130
- We can probably meet with Chairman Bi.
- All right.

31
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,780
When I meet with Chairman Bi, I'll take you with me.

32
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,610
Director Luo, can I ask a question that shouldn't be asked?

33
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,120
Go ahead.

34
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,720
Are you really not afraid of losing Chairman Zhang here in Beijing?

35
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,380
I'm sorry to bother you, Sir, but the plane is about to taxi.

36
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,540
- Please return to your own seat.
- One minute! We're almost finished.

37
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,720
This is Huikang's most important customer.

38
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,460
Are you really not worried that Zhou Rui will steal him?

39
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,200
Wang Yi Nan, can't you keep interrupting me?

40
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,950
I need to meet with at least three customers before midnight.

41
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:13,150
- I'll try.
- Don't just try, you must stop.

42
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,750
Sir, I'm sorry to interrupt you.

43
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,490
Please return to your own seat.

44
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,220
All right.

45
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:24,380
Please fasten your seat-belt and turn off all electronic devices.

46
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,470
- How are your preparations going?
- Really good. There shouldn't be any problems.

47
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,770
I can deliver it.

48
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,580
Where have you been?

49
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,180
- I was out gambling.
- I'm not in the mood to joke.

50
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,940
Do you know that Luo Jia has already stolen two Hangzhou customers?

51
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,740
- Yes, I know.
- If you know, why are you still here?

52
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,990
Go to Hangzhou and get them back.

53
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,970
Master, Director Wei is in charge of the East China Region.

54
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:14,090
If someone needs to go, it should be him.

55
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,440
What do you mean by that?

56
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,770
I just called and the customers that Luo Jia stole are Yang Lu's customers.

57
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,940
Zhou Rui, do you take us all for fools?

58
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,950
Master, can I not respond to his question?

59
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:29,360
You'll need to as I also want to know.

60
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,430
Zhang Ming Cheng of Mantoo Company

61
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,980
is Huikang's most well-established and valued customer,

62
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,480
and also accounts for a third of Huikang's performance record.

63
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,770
Why don't we take advantage of their weak point and try to grab this piece of the pie?

64
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,980
Wake up! Are you speaking in a dream language?

65
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,520
Then, just go to Hangzhou and get mutilated.

66
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,400
Isn't your idea crazy?

67
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,820
Then let Master decide.

68
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,110
Zhang Ming Cheng is a giant.

69
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,080
If you look away for just a second, he'll cream you.

70
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,230
Master, you taught me this.

71
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,170
How does a shark get to eat a whale?

72
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:08,010
One shark against a whale doesn't do anything.

73
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,650
But what about five sharks? Ten sharks?

74
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,920
Fifty sharks? A hundred? Then what would the whale do?

75
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,280
Why does it seem like you're theorizing pointlessly?

76
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,480
Tell us your specific plan.

77
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,630
Do you think I would tell you?

78
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,760
Answer my calls!

79
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,110
President Lin, where are you right now?

80
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,810
I have something urgent to tell you.

81
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,540
Don't say it on the phone! Meet me at He Guang Ge.

82
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,510
I'm already at He Guang Pavillion.

83
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:05,040
Hello? Hello?

84
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,690
Too late! Too late!

85
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,780
As the main contact person for this venture,

86
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,260
Wang Yi Nan will report directly to me.

87
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:41,600
And our Beijing salespeople will work together with the East China coworkers.

88
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,340
As for dividing customers, go ahead with the orders I just gave.

89
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,910
Early tomorrow morning we get to work.

90
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,820
- Does anyone have any questions?
- Director Luo, I have a question.

91
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,910
What is it?

92
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,880
In the East China Region, Jieke is always suppressing Huikang.

93
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,030
It's because of their excellence in technology.

94
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,420
This forces us to lower our prices.

95
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,790
If we want to steal all of Yang Lu's customers,

96
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,900
maybe we need support in the area of technology.

97
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,110
We're thinking the same thing.

98
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,720
- Where are you?
- I'm almost at the door.

99
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,930
Good!

100
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:22,070
Xiao Sun, go to open the door.

101
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,600
Director Luo, Engineer Liu is here.

102
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,310
Hi, Engineer Liu.

103
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,950
- It has been hard on you.
- No problem.

104
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,990
This time, I asked Engineer Liu back.

105
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,410
He'll be responsible for all technological questions.

106
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,590
Every group can directly contact him when they have questions.

107
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,550
In a bit, you can add him on WeChat.

108

[President Lin]

109
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,500
Sit.

110
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,830
If it's a customer with serious technology demands,

111
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,590
- Engineer Liu will meet with them personally.
- Okay.

112
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:11,060
For customers without serious technology demands, I'll handle them.

113
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,280
- President—
- Is Luo Jia with you?

114
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,920
Yes, she's here.

115
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,610
Turn it on speaker.

116
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,940
All right, President Lin.

117
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,680
Luo Jia.

118
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,360
Luo Jia!

119
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,660
Right here!

120
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,420
- I'm here.
- I told you to maintain a relationship with Chairman Zhang in Beijing.

121
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,770
What are you doing in Hangzhou?

122
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:45,530
President Lin, I already stole two of Jieke's paying customers.

123
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:49,520
Luo Jia, do you not understand the difference between a watermelon and a sesame seed?

124
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,820
Do you think that Chairman Zhang's company, Mantoo Technology, will always only be faithful to us?

125
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:01,040
President Lin, I think Zhou Rui is playing a decoy tactic.

126
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,250
Even if Jieke's rookie wants to meet Chairman Zhang.

127
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,620
Not to mention first whether he can get to meet him,

128
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,680
as long as Chairman Zhang doesn't leave Mantoo, he's our solid support.

129
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,120
Luo Jia, you need to clearly understand this that at this moment,

130
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,420
Jieke's people are having dinner with Director Mei and Chairman Zhang at He Guang Pavilion.

131
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,520
Let me tell you, Luo Jia!

132
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,900
If you lose Chairman Zhang just for winning something trivial,

133
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,270
I'll come after you.

134
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:40,300
Xiao Le, come here!

135
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,330
Xiao Le, make flight reservations, you and I will leave for Beijing tonight.

136
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,810
Okay.

137
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,110
Engineer Liu.

138
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,830
- Let me have your phone number.
- Here, here, here!

139
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,280
We really need you.

140
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,990
- Okay.
- Okay.

141
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:23,060
Let's analyze the remaining customers.

142
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,890
Xuntong Company, Shang Tong Qian.

143
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,690
- What? Did you already finish for today?
- Exactly.

144
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,390
You should have said something earlier.

145
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,570
- Go, go, go.
- Yes, go!

146
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,040
- Today, we won't stop until we're drunk.
- Fine, fine! Sure will.

147
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,790
Let's go!

148
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,480
- Go!
- You guys, go ahead.

149
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,990
- I'll be right there.
- Okay, hurry up!

150
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,630
- We'll wait for you.
- We'll go first.
- Let's go!

151
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,150
President Liu.

152
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,390
President Liu.

153
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,020
Did you finish your work?

154
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,620
I've been waiting all day here.

155
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,390
- You must be tired.
- I'm okay.

156
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,420
- You're okay?
- Yeah.

157
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,500
Okay? Then you can keep on waiting.

158
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,070
President Liu, I know what you mean.

Director Zhou has been busy and hasn't had time to sign.

I'm really ashamed to see you.

I think Jieke is quite interesting.

162

I sent you the contract of intention.

163

You didn't sign, are you playing with me?

164
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:44,660
No, no, no! President Liu, the contract is for certain.

165
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:49,010
Rest assured! I'll go back to rush our leader.

Do you know why you are poor?

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,750
- Tell me!
- It's because you don't understand the rules.

You aren't sincere.

169

You definitely can't achieve anything.

170

If you didn't beg me repeatedly,

171

I wouldn't have sympathy for the vulnerable groups.

- Before tomorrow, I will definitely place the contract in your office.
- See you at the office then.

If you miss again, you and Jieke

Do you think someone is secretly sending messages?

180
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:51,330
Master, those of us in sales are particularly suspicious.

It can be both good and bad.

I'd actually want to be open and honest to be a gentleman.

Did your grandson find this place for you?

316
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,980
Yes, he isn't just bad at apartment hunting,

317
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,390
he's no good at anything else.

318
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:47,530
As long as he's good at finding a girlfriend, isn't that more important?

319
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:50,280
I don't think any woman

320
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:55,240
will want him from now on.

321
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:00,970
No matter what you say, I still think this is a pretty good place.

322
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:04,530
- It's a good find.
- A good find?

323
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,340
How is it good?

324
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,920
It's close to me.

325
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,230
Come here, Grandma!

326
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,780
Look at that building over there on the third floor to the apartment with the curtains closed.

327
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,370
That's my home.

328
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:32,470
It'll be so convenient for us to visit each other from now on.

329
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,840
Isn't this too coincidental?

330
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:46,050
You must be paid by the real estate agency!

331
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,150
I... I was paid?

332
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:52,520
You wouldn't even be my client if I was paid.

333
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,620
I'll go for a handsome, young, gentle, kind,

334
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,440
and rich guy.

335
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,500
Seriously!

336
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:04,470
So in your words,

337
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:09,960
my grandson has those qualities.

338
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:15,100
However, you can't trick him.

339
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:19,620
Your grandson is the best.

340
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:31,640
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

341
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:35,080
Thanks.

342
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:40,660
- Looks like I'll have to work late again.
-  Director Luo wants to know if you are satisfied with the gift you received.

343
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:43,810
I'm not sure if I would say I'm satisfied, but I was certainly surprised.

344
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:47,310
Then that's great! I'm sure she'd be happy to hear that.

345
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:50,820
Oh, yes! Director Luo says you have helped her every time she wants to see Chairman Zhang,

346
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,100
- so she has prepared a gift for you.
- That's not necessary.

347
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,890
Please accept it!

348
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,460
Director Luo is really considerate.

349
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:00,190
By the way, is Chairman Zhang back yet?

350
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:02,810
Still not yet, but I've been instructed to ask

351
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:05,200
Director Luo to wait when she gets here.

352
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,420
But according to the airline's information, Chairman Zhang's flight should have landed already.

353
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:11,920
The flight has indeed landed, but Chairman Zhang has left the airport with other people.

354
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,100
- Okay, I won't keep you from your work.
- Okay. Goodbye.

355
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:33,180
Director Luo, someone met Chairman Zhang at the airport as soon as his flight landed.

356
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,780
My apology, Director Luo!

357
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,060
I've kept you waiting.

358
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,350
Jieke's Zhou Rui came to meet me at the airport.

359
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:49,080
We spent some time talking.
[Jieke Company]

360
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,580
Chairman Zhang, are you trying to use Jieke to put pressure on me?

361
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,730
Of course, not! However, I have to evaluate my options.

362
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:58,680
Even marriage can experience a seven-year itch.

363
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,600
You have to allow me to consider other possibilities, don't you?

364
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:06,700
You can consider, but you should not act on it.

365
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,270
Actually, it's going to be a difficult decision.

366
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:16,520
Jieke offers new products at a discounted price.

367
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,310
If Huikang doesn't change,

368
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:22,230
like an emperor's daughter who refuses to marry.

369
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:24,740
then it'll be difficult for me to convince the Board of Directors.

370
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:29,440
Moreover, our company's budget has been reduced by fifteen percent this year.

371
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,420
I'm sure you already know.

372
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:36,500
Chairman Zhang, actually, we're willing to match.

373
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:41,430
Besides, our prices offer more advantages.

374
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:51,790
it naturally include our sincerity and affection for you.

375
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,510
Fine! Then let me keep this information.

376
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:02,570
Our company will still have to hold a meeting and discuss before a decision can be made concerning the contract renewal.

377
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:05,670
I'll let you know as soon as there is news.

378
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:08,580
Chairman Zhang,

379
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:11,100
no matter what price Jieke gives you,

380
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,660
I'll give you five percent lower.

381
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:18,940
You're really determined to beat Jieke?

382
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,980
I've no choice.

383
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,220
It's been said that you can tell a person's character by their writing.

384
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,920
So is Director Zhou really a domineering guy?

385
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,250
He's usually quite easygoing.

386
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,440
We call him "red-haired prince".

387
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,120
Take a look at his signature!

388
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,010
Why does he draw a knife above his name?

389
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,400
It's a simple expression of his emotions

390
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,110
while reading the contract;

391
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:55,640
he felt happy and excited.

392
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,970
Okay. I'll let our legal department take a look, then I'll sign also.

393
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,250
I'm looking forward to working together and I'm excited.

394
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,990
I'm excitedly looking forward to your investment.

395
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,730
Let's go!

396
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:09,430
Do you want me to go jogging with you again, Director Liu?

397
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,340
No, I'm saying you can leave.

398
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:16,480
Fine! But I've brought my running shoes, Director Liu.

399
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:41,210
Grandma, something smells so delicious.

400
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:43,840
I can smell it from the hallway.

401
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,500
How fortunate for our neighbors!

402
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,980
After we move to the new apartment,

403
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:53,020
I'll take some food to the new neighbors.

404
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,750
Don't!

405
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:57,720
Northerners don't care for this food.

406
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,500
Grandma, are you keeping a diary?

407
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,730
You can't read this!

408
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:17,120
These are my secret recipes.

409
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,810
Grandma, how much salt did you put in? It's so salty.

410
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:32,020
It's salted crab, so it has to have plenty of salt.

411
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,530
If it's not salty enough, it won't taste good.

412
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,320
Salty food makes you eat more rice and I want you to eat two more bowls.

413
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,580
You seem to have lost weight recently.

414
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,660
Ever since you came, I have put on more weight.

415
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,390
I'm growing fat.

416
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,660
I've decided on the apartment.

417
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:21,210
It's exactly the one you picked.

418
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:23,850
I really like it.

419
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:28,970
- Hurry and finish the paperwork, so we can move soon.
- Okay.

420
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:32,640
This hotel suite is too small!

421
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,010
It isn't comfortable staying here.

422
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:49,380
[Find]
[The message had been sent, but was rejected by the other party.]

423
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,480
[Go]
[The message had been sent, but was rejected by the other party.]

424
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,620
Cui Long!

425
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,600
Cui Long, come here!

426
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,300
- What?
- Just come here.

427
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,400
- What for?
- Come here.

428
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,700
Do you know what it means to be a successful person?

429
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,300
Say what in your mind! Why are you holding it back?

430
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,400
I just framed it yesterday, it's still warm.

431
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,200
- Where are you going to vomit?
- Give them a glimpse.

432
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,300
- What to see?
- Handsome Brother Dong, you're back.

433
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,300
Brother Dong is back!

434
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:35,400
Brother Dong, you got promoted and didn't even invite everyone to dinner.

435
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,100
Leaving without saying goodbye that's not your style.

436
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,800
Brother Dong, how is Hangzhou?

437
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,300
- Is it hot?
- Not bad!

438
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,700
Everyone is leaving, so there aren't many of us left in the group.

439
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,600
Director Mei is calling.

440
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:52,740
Hello, Director Mei.

441
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,500
What?

442
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,300
Are you kidding?

443
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,200
Director Mei, no! We've agreed beforehand.

444
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,500
- Director Mei, you can't do thing like this. Director Mei... Director Mei!
- What happened?

445
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,800
- Hello! Director Mei!
- What is it?

446
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,270
He said...

447
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:17,500
He said they renewed the contract with Huikang.

448
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,960
Director Zhou?

449
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,100
Director Zhou.

450
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,200
A moment ago...

451
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,100
A moment ago that surname Mei called and said

452
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,530
they decided to renew their contract with Huikang.

453
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,150
All our previous efforts have been wasted.

454
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,100
First of all, I apologize to all of you!

455
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,100
What does it mean?

456
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,700
I lied to everyone.

457
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,800
Actually, I do know that Huikang has been in business with Mantoo for so many years.

458
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,500
We momentarily can't get hold of Mantoo's Chairman Zhang.

459
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,100
- No—
- But

460
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,500
our business in Eastern China is our strong position in Jieke.

461
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:09,100
It's half of the landscape, so we absolutely won't let it being lost.

462
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:14,300
So forcing Luo Jia to give up business negotiation in Eastern China to return to Beijing,

463
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,600
we've already won.

464
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,200
We didn't lose.

465
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,400
Of course, it's a risky move.

466
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,900
It's done!

467
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:28,500
Our Jieke can take a warm breath;

468
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:32,300
however, if that doesn't work, it'll be complete failure.

469
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,600
Director Zhou, what about now?

470
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,100
Right now, right now?

471
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:45,300
Right now, please let Chao Dong explain to you.

472
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,100
Pleasant Cooperation!

473
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,690
President Ming, please give me 15 minutes.

474
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:51,100
After 15 minutes, we'll finish the correction and send it to you.

475
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:54,900
- I didn't tell you that.
- Change! Change it one more time.

476
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,800
- Chao Dong, can you confirm President Yang's time for me?
- Okay, Okay, Okay.

477
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,000
Here! Move it a little.

478
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,500
All the people in Group A prepare for the business trip immediately.

479
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,600
Wang Yi Nan and her team are already inside.

480
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,100
Why didn't you write Party A?

481
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,500
You have to arrive before Huikang does.

482
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,500
Everyone, make it quick!

483
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,300
Let me tell you!

484
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:20,500
If you lose Chairman Zhang just for winning something trivial,

485
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,500
I'll come after you.

486
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,100
Okay, okay. See you tomorrow.

487
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,900
I understand now.

488
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:53,100
Brother Dong, you aren't coming back this time to say goodbye.

489
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,100
You're here to show off victory.

490
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,000
Director Zhou said something previously.

491
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,600
I didn't achieve the victory alone, nor did I establish fame on my own.

492
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,100
Without you pulling the strings in Beijing,

493
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,300
I would've died in Hangzhou.

494
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,100
However, I can see something clearly finally.

495
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:15,000
Director Zhou really shaped East China Region into a calvary.

496
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,600
Have you heard of "foul wind and bloody rain?"

497
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:24,720
That's what I went through.

498
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,100
Chao Dong!

499
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,800
Director Zhou.

500
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,900
The lead contributor in the East China battle.

501
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,300
No.

502
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,300
I won't say thanks then.

503
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,300
I really did it for myself.

504
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,700
Yang Lu left.

505
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:48,200
I know it's President Chen who transferred me to East China.

506
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,900
It's actually also what the company had to do out of helplessness.

507
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:54,600
Doesn't this fulfill your wish to establish your own kingdom?

508
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,300
Yes.

509
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:59,200
I really don't want to be stuck between you and Director Wei.

510
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,900
I'll only die terribly in the battle between you two.

511
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,800
I really envy you.

512
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:11,680
You only focus on business taking the side with the most gains.

513
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,500
It's simple and pure.

514
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,900
It's because I'm not that ambitious.

515
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,900
I'm leaving.

516
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:48,800
Are you here to show off or to say goodbye?

517
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,300
Neither.

518
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:58,700
I just wanted to tell you that I want to live differently.

519
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:07,700
Other than congratulations, what else can I say?

520
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:11,100
Now that you're leaving, let me offer you a few words.

521
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:16,200
President Chen will leave sooner or later. Understand?

522
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,600
Understood!

523
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:23,400
- Jieke will be sold sooner or later.
- Understood.

524
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,600
When Jieke isn't named under Chen anymore,

525
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,500
it could be named under Wei.

526
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,300
I understand.

527
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:37,700
Whatever I have today comes from the opportunities you gave me.

528
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,900
I'll never forget it.

529
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,700
However, I hope that you'll forget me.

530
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,100
We'll go our separate ways then.

531
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,100
Okay. I've said what I should say.

532
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,900
Director Wei, I'm leaving.

533
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,940
What?

534
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,900
You aren't getting the goods from me?

535
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:25,000
Director Luo, the seven-year itch is over.

536
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,700
I think we can have another seven years.

537
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:31,300
Our collaboration must continue.

538
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:34,000
How about tomorrow?

539
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,100
Sure, tomorrow! Tomorrow is good.

540
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,500
No, no! Look at my memory.

541
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,400
I can't do it tomorrow as I still have two meetings that I can't get out of.

542
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,700
The day after tomorrow then.

543
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:46,500
Let's do this! I'll tell my subordinate to sync up the schedule with you for the day after tomorrow.

544
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,900
No problem, Chairman Zhang!

545
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:51,300
Then, about the detailed contract, I'll tell my people...

546
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:55,500
The contract is important, but I think it's even more important to meet and chat about old times.

547
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,000
Let's do the day after tomorrow! I'll finalize the contract's detailed clauses the day after tomorrow.

548
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,300
- You'll be happy then. Don't you worry!
- Okay, okay. No problem.

549
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,300
Okay. See you then!

550
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,490
- Call right now!
- Okay.

551
00:41:57,490 --> 00:41:59,800
The conditions in the contract can be relaxed.

552
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,200
Wang Yi Nan, how was your chat with the clients today?

553
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,740
Director Luo, I was just about to call you.

554
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,700
The orders in East China...

555
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:16,500
The orders in East China have all been grabbed back by Jieke.

556
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,900
Let's do this, Wang Yi Nan!

557
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:21,600
Right now... Call all the clients right now.

558
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,500
- Make it fast!
- I've confirmed with all of them.

559
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,300
Zhou Rui.

560
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,400
[President Lin]
