[Episode 11]

22
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,000
President Lin, Chairman Liu is in a meeting.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,810
- He isn't in his office right now.
- How many times have I made an appointment?

24
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:49,310
He doesn't even have five minutes?

25
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,170
Come this way!

26
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,370
This way.

27
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,730
- Come! Be careful!
- Here! Put it here first.

28
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,120
Don't touch it!

29
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,840
Director Wei, your phone's ringing.

30
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,870
I was about to bring it to you.

31
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,310
Come! Come!

32
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,420
I'll do it! Let me!

33
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,970
Okay. That's fine.

34
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,930
Director Wei, do you know

35
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,060
how much the company will lose this time?

36
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,090
What you're worried about is what the Board of Directors should be worrying about.

37
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,690
Look at this deal that you and Zhou Rui did.

38
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,890
You've made it so even the suppliers I use are also unwilling to supply us.

39
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,960
Our bank loans need to be reassessed, too.

40
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,090
Even President Chen doesn't know what to do.

41
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,850
Haven't I been trying to think of ways to make up for it?

42
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,110
It's not up to you.

43
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:23,540
- Someone else will take the responsibility for you.
- When I heard that the sales department was going through layoffs,

44
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,090
I was devastated.

45
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,940
You aren't on the list.

46
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,650
Thank you, Director Wei.

47
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,660
Director Wei,

48
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,280
the refrigerator gifted to you by the administration department is still empty.

49
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,970
- Why don't you give an order? I'll fill it up for you.
 - You can ignore my call, but you have to show up!

50
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,950
Dad?

51
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:03,020
- Dad.
- Daughter.

52
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,730
Daughter.

53
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:12,760
Daughter, why are you crying?

54
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,420
Don't cry! The weather's so cold.

55
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,480
Why did you come back?

56
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,710
Why did you come back without saying anything?

57
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,290
Your mom misses you so much.

58
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,500
I also missed you both.

59
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,620
Are you cold?

60
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,900
Dad, did you call the tow truck?

61
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,520
I called forest management, but they don't have the vehicle right now.

62
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,500
They aren't sure when they'll get to it.

63
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,550
- Let's go! We'll take my car to go home first.
- Daughter, there's still the sheep.

64
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,300
- Why do you have sheep?
- The community center distributed sheep.

65
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,710
The driver wasn't there so I took it home.

66
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,400
Then...

67
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,730
Then get the towing rope.

68
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,270
Take it easy!

69
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,080
Easy, easy, easy!

70
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,360
Daughter, you know how to tie it?

71
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,930
- That end.
- No problem.

72
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,400
- Is it ready, Daughter?
- Ready.

73
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,620
- Ready.
- All right. Come on!

74
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,090
I'll pull it tight first.

75
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,660
Okay, all right.

76
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,120
It's tight.

77
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:04,830
- All right, together now!
- All right!

78
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,830
Great!

79
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,760
It's good now.

80
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,250
I'll disconnect the rope.

81
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,720
All right, time to go home!

82
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,690
The O&T situation

83
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,410
caused us to go weeks without regular meetings.

84
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:01,910
At today's meeting, we'll assign everyone's performance quotas,

85
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,990
it's an increase of twenty percent.

86
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:08,040
Director Zhou, the Beijing team's previous quotas were already difficult to meet.

87
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,790
If you increase them by twenty percent, then it'll be even more impossible.

88
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,730
That's right, Director Zhou! O&T's payout is estimated to drop soon.

89
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,040
When that happens, it'll definitely be the sales department that has to bear the responsibility.

90
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,570
How does that old saying go?

91
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,620
I'd rather get beaten to death than die of fear.

92
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,620
The court session hasn't even started

93
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,480
and each of you have declared the death penalty for yourselves already?

94
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,760
Direct Zhou, from O&T to Fast Corp, we've followed you loyally.

95
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,220
Yet you don't even encourage us.

96
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:41,640
This is what I think, this is what life is like in sales.

97
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,860
It's very exciting.

98
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,520
How about this.

99
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:49,390
I'll carry the bulk of the twenty percent increase this quarter.

100
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:53,500
You all can continue working at your previous quotas, all right?

101
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,420
- However, I have new requests.
- Director Zhou,

102
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,760
there's something that might be offensive,

103
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,560
but I'm still going to say it.

104
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,840
Director Wei has never given us clients.

105
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,590
Then where are the new clients?

106
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:11,570
Then, have the receivables of the old customers been recovered?

107
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:15,180
Tracking down receivables is much harder than developing new clients.

108
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,400
What's the purpose of tracking down payments?

109
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,130
It's to maintain the relationship with old customers.

110
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,730
One old customer holds the weight of three new customers.

111
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:26,110
You all lack a fighting spirit.

112
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,600
I really want to ask you all,

113
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,200
how do you make lucrative sales without putting in much effort?

114
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,660
No one's taught us how, Director Zhou.

115
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,020
I'll do whatever Director Zhou tells me to.

116
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:45,340
I want to ask, what if I meet my performance quota?

117
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,890
You, Cui Long?

118
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,590
I'll...

119
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,100
- I bet that you won't meet it.
- I bet that I'll meet it.

120
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,250
- I bet he'll meet it.
- All right.

121
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,620
Ye Chao Dong, are you betting?

122
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,160
- You.
- I'll bet.

123
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,930
But not now.

124
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:10,660
This is a battle of life or death, so I need to see what cards you have.

125
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,400
Okay, fine, all right. How about this!

126
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,630
I won't care what everyone's work method is.

127
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,180
However, here...

128
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,050
is this quarter's performance commitment document.

129
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,500
From today onward, I'll treat everyone equally.

130
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,590
Within one month, everyone will try their best to meet it.

131
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,240
If we meet it,

132
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,670
- Here.
- you can make any request you want.

133
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,410
However, if we don't meet it... Listen up!

134
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,690
If we don't meet it,

135
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:42,600
I won't be the only one who will be leaving Jieke.

136
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,960
Cui Long, Fang Wei, do you guys have problems?

137
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,370
- Why are you willing to make any bet?
- Xie Yi!

138
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,630
You need to have confidence in yourself.

139
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:58,800
Confidence my foot! I hate tracking down money the most.

140
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,030
It's always so awkward. I'm over it!

141
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,820
How about this?

142
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,460
Today we don't have time.

143
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:10,480
Tomorrow, I'll treat you all to dinner, all right?

144
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,020
I just joined the sales department, so I should treat everyone.

145
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,340
Xie Yi, what do you want to eat?

146
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,720
- What do you want to eat?
- Anything, as long as it isn't barbecue.

147
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,160
- Barbecue.
- All right, barbecue.

148
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,130
Everyone, come and join.

149
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,340
- Who's there?
- Me, Mom!

150
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,570
What are you doing? Scared me to death.

151
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:02,110
- Our precious daughter is back.
- You scared me to death.

152
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,190
You should have told us you were coming back.

153
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,900
Mom, don't use the hot water. It's cold in here.

154
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,210
I forgot! I forgot!

155
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,870
She came home so abruptly.

156
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,200
[Goddess]

157
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,610
[Goddess]

158
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,550
Grandma.

159
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,930

00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,680
just mention our company's service to her.

They have many other options aside from you to consider and shop around from.

306
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,590
It doesn't matter how many benefits you give them,

307
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,620
if you don't give them top-notch service, you won't be able to keep them.

The fact is, the results are the same no matter what we do.

It isn't something that can be explained just by labeling it as urgent.

It isn't urgent, is it?

It isn't up to you whether you want to acknowledge it or not.

If it wasn't for Jieke's Zhou Rui,

the compensation amount would be much higher than this.

Then why were you in such a rush to see me then?

Is it just so you could dispute it with me?

368

Yes, to dispute it.

- To dispute the amount.
- Fine!

370

Saihanba is so huge, is there a specific address?

00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,740
Sorry, Director Zhou! This is all I can say.

Sister Jia won't allow me to say anything.

I didn't even tell President Lin;

500
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,640
however, I feel that I should tell you.

501

Okay, thanks.

- Then, did she say why she left?
- Didn't say.

503
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,420
She texted me to say that she was going back to her parents' home.

504
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,710
She forbid me from telling anyone.

505
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:46,250
Then when I texted her again,

506
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,800
she stopped replying.

507
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,440
Do you have the address of her parents' home?

508
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,830
- Then you can't tell Director Luo that I told you.
- Tell me now.

509
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:59,210
When I tell her later that you gave me her address, she'll definitely thank you.
