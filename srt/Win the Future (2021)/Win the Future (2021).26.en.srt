To me, you've come today.

It's so that we both can make the flight.

I do! I believe you; I really believe you.

- You don't need to worry about that.

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,480
I agree. I agree. I absolutely agree!

118
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,930
You're Fast's shareholder.

119
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,910
As long as we make money, you'll be Fast's grandfather.

How are you the senior technical consultant?

124
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:27,070
Director Zhou is our company's shareholder.

125
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,970
About the whole process of our company's cloud computing platform, he understands it the clearest.

126
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,190
So he has the most right to speak.

127
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:37,960
Director Zhao, I am representing Fast as an individual for the Q&A.

128
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,450
Director Zhou, sit, sit!

129
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,650
Zhou Rui,

130
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,720
you originally didn't have any chance.

131
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,890
But I believe everyone will be willing to listen to me talking about cloud computing, won't they?

132
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:07,340
In general,

133
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:11,650
two nodes can support a hundred concurrent processes.

134
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:16,000
Moreover, this time, for the O&T shopping platform, we prepared six hundred nodes.

135
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,080
So that also means they can support thirty thousand concurrent processes,

136
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,760
Simultaneously, it can support ten million online customers.

137
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,340
But I recommend that you expand the capacity before Double Eleven.
 (TN: November 11 is a Shopping Holiday)

138
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:34,230
- Director Luo. Luo—
- Are they calling for us yet?

139
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,120
We should be the only team left now.

140
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,310
Zhou Rui and that Cao guy went in there again.

141
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:57,200
- Is that so?
- It's been five minutes already, and they still aren't out yet.

142
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:08,280
Large bandwidth is a special trait of cloud computing.

143
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:12,700
The customer can refresh the (web) page as fast as 0.1 to 0.3 seconds.

144
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:17,600
Compared to traditional servers, cloud computing servers are relatively more concentrated.

145
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,230
If there is any malfunction, there's no need to go to the server locations to handle it

146
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:23,100
like in the case with traditional servers,

147
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,070
because that will greatly decrease efficiency.

148
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:29,750
Therefore, most manufacturers would respond on the second business day.

149
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,750
But our engineers are right at the cloud computing center.

150
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,310
We guarantee that we'll arrive at the scene in five minutes, and solve the problem in thirty minutes.

151
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:40,140
- Can the response time be that fast?
- Actually, it can be even faster.

152
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,700
That's right, that's right!

153
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,900
Is this realistic?

154
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,280
This... It's just that...

155
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,870
Director Zhao.

156
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,580
The malfunction rate of cloud computing is much lower than that of traditional servers,

157
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,000
because we have done a lot of redundancy testing on the our existing foundation.

158
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,140
At the same time, we've installed an anti-earthquake and disaster-prevention system as a safeguard.

159
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,100
I'll give you the bottom line.

160
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,270
I can't guarantee that it's a hundred percent foolproof.

161
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:09,790
However, if any problem occurs, I guarantee that the response will be a hundred percent proof.

162
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,240
For both traditional servers and cloud computing,

163
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,920
every method has its own risks.

164
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,340
Are you leaning more towards cloud computing?

165
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,080
Let's decide using the prices.

166
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,560
Huikang is still eighty percent more suitable.

167
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,780
We'll look at the pricing.

168
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,040
Fast's representatives, please leave first, and wait outside the door for a moment.

169
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,340
Later on, both companies will proceed to negotiate on the prices.

170
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:54,360
Let's compare carefully again and then decide.

171
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,830
Zhou Rui, what did they mean when they told us to go out?

172
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,620
- We're in the finals.
- Really?

173
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:05,420
- Do you want to win?
- Brother, why do you ask that?

174
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,830
All these years, I, Cao Tian You have been enduring hardships and humiliation; isn't this what I've been waiting for?

175
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:12,160
You have to promise me that you'll do anything at all cost.

176
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,310
At any cost!

177
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,760
- it's done!
- Wonderful, President Cao! We're in the finals!

178
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,060
Why are you laughing? You still laugh.

179
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,940
About last night,

180
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,650
I'm sorry!

181
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,980
Zhou Rui, I really have to give it to you.

182
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:55,370
Really! I admire you totally.

183
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,420
Why can't I completely beat you down?

184
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:05,070
Representatives of Huikang and Fast, please come in

185
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,600
Okay, okay, okay.

186
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,720
Zhou Rui! Let's go.

187
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,310
Hurry up!

188
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,730
The price list is in front of you.

189
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:51,230
If there is no change, then you can sign it.

190
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:54,710
If there is any change, then fill in your final price and then sign it.

191
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,920
Okay, Huikang isn't changing it.

192
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,530
- We won't change it, either.
- We are changing it.

193
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:03,180
Zhou Rui, what are you doing?

194
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:10,320
Fast's final price is ¥0.01.

195
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:16,540
[¥0.01]

196

Zhou Rui, what are you doing?

197
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:28,160
Zhou Rui, no matter what happened,

198
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,270
you can't be joking here.

199
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,240
I am not joking.

200
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,460
One penny.

201
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,050
Our price is one penny.

202
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,740
Zhou Rui, why?

203
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:48,650
Zhou Rui, this is the bidding site.

204
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,570
I can give you a few minutes to discuss it amongst yourselves.

205
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:55,270
Agree on the price before you submit it.

206
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,690
- Okay.
- No.

207
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:00,800
We maintain our current decision.

Zhou Rui.

212

I don't know what kind of grievance you've suffered.

213
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:43,700
I also don't know what irritated you.

214

Why?

215
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,930
Why is it that every time I want to help you,

216
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,510
you push me to death?

217
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,230
You're sweating a lot. Low blood sugar?

218

Should I find something sweet for you?

219
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:02,550
You may as well give me poison.

220
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,630
Focus and listen to me!

221
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,700
With the scores on quality and business,

222
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,740
Fast and Huikang have a 47-point difference in total.

223
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,580
Following the normal pricing process, we'll definitely die.

224
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,420
Free is our only way out.

225
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,300
Whenever I hear the word "Free" now, I panic.

226

Zhou Rui,

227
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,480
if we lose, we can find another market.

228
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,090
If we lose money,

229
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,900
we'll have to be brothers in the next life then.

230
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,820
Okay.

231
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:55,500
Let's stop our collaboration here then.

232
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,360
Starting from tomorrow,

233
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:03,640
I'll withdraw all the equipment that Jieke provided for the cloud platform.

You're crazy.

Do you think others see you as a hero?

A perfect idealist?

240
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,710
Let me tell you, Zhou Rui! To me, you...

It's already 21; we're next.

Don't just stand here! I'll accompany you back to your seat.

I was really anxious just now, do you think there will be anything wrong with the baby?

Don't think about it! Aren't we here now?

The bidding should be over by now, shouldn't it?

Go ahead!

Director Zhou is really too clever.

295
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:08,300
His idea is actually just like a bicycle sharing system.

296
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:12,200
This is just sharing the server, so that's why one penny isn't a gimmick.

297
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,100
It's just changing the idea of buying houses into renting them instead.

298
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,760
That's why one penny is just for the first year.

299
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,520
I don't have much of an imagination.

300
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,180
However, I can feel that his idea,

301
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:29,240
is to provide poor and small business a future full of imagination.

302
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,290
Thank you, Engineer Liu.

303
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,080
I understand now.

304
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:47,460
Director Luo,

305
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,290
You know me.

306
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:53,530
I'll vote according to my heart, so that's why...

307
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:57,730
I might fail to live up to your expectations for transferring me here.

308
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,800
I'll only respect you more.

I'm not.

313
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,800
Director Luo, isn't it too soon to admit defeat?

314
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,910
Is there anybody else who wants to win more than me?

315
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,430
Zhou Rui really knows how to grab attention.

316
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:54,320
Will he die if he takes two predictable steps?

317
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,880
He will.

318
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,660
He really will.

319
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:10,190
He really will. He really will!

320
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,490
Don't expect me to help you this time.

321
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:15,070
The company is dealing with this according to its policy.

322
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:17,840
I'm only reminding you not to make any mistakes again in the future.

323
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,980
I'm taking you guys along, it isn't for me to wipe your butts.

324
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:26,730
Didn't you do that for Feng Wei last time?

325
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,730
Are you the same as he?

326
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:32,140
Whether it's business or personal, you're starkly different.

327
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:38,220
Besides, he was used by someone.

328
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,700
And you? Yours is a criminal offense.

329
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,290
Do you understand?

330
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,650
I can't help you.

331
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,270
Can you get off here? I can't give you a ride anymore.

332
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,050
Go and get yourself a taxi.

333
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:13,640
Wait, Director Luo!

334
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,650
Did I say something wrong?

335
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,250
What did I say?

336
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:24,860
Zhou Rui is a gangster and faked his sense of justice. He's a jerk!

337
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,490
Get out of the car here.

338
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,090
- You should at least let me—
- Get out of the car!

339
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:38,580
Wait! You should at least, drive me a bit to find a subway.

340
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,480
Why?

341
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:31,770
Why do I have to be perfect when I'm with you?

342
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,940
The competition is so intense.

343
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:37,040
Survival is so difficult.

I'll continue to do it until the end without any regrets.

347

I'm not doing all of this for myself.

Cui Long!

00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,540
What are you doing? Surrendering yourself?

368
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:45,000
I'll bear the consequences for my own actions.

369
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,890
You guys have nothing to do with this.

370
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:49,900
If worse comes to worst, I'll quit.

371
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:57,070
I'll go home and inherit my family wealth.

372
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:59,800
Bad mud won't hold up the walls.

373
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:03,220
That's right!

374
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,710
I'm indeed bad mud, but I did it for the sake of everyone else.

375
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:10,550
Stealing the bidding documents is the same as stealing towers to me.

376
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:14,330
It's because you stole the tower that Zhou Rui lost and Jieke failed.

377
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:18,180
- The whole army was wiped out.
- Let me ask you! Why do you play games?

378
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:22,220
Why?

379
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:32,820
I do it to... to feel like I have a presence.

380
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:56,540
I've never felt like I've had a presence before.

381
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,980
My parents started to do business when I was in elementary school.

382
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:08,540
I transferred schools with them everywhere they went.

383
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:11,090
They all said that I was a son of the nouveau riche and didn't want to play with me.
(T/N: Getting rich from new money rather than inheriting old money.)

384
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:14,610
Scram! Play with me or not! Take it or leave it!

385
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:18,440
Fine! I'll play games by myself.

386
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:23,680
I only feel useful when I'm playing games.

387
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,600
That's why I thought of stealing the bidding documents.

388
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,650
I wanted our team to win because of me.

389
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:31,200
I wanted our boss to gain honor.

390
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,800
- I want you to think highly of me, Bei Yaoyao!
- Let me go back to where I came from!

391
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,800
I should be the one who needs to pack up and scram.

392
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,800
Did I have a single word of complaint?

393
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,650
It's right to fight for our honor,

394
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:55,400
but if we lose, we also need to lose with dignity.

395
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,880
You're alright, at least, you can go back home.

396
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,700
What about me?

397
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,800
I don't even know where I can go now.

398
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,000
Let's play a round!

399
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,900
- Do you want to play?
-

400
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
You're pretty good.

401
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,700
You're at the Challenger level; you hid it so well.

402
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,800
Let's both delete the game after this round.

403
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,520
Why?

404
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,200
Go over there.

405
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,750
Go over there, go over there!

406
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,650
If a person is unwilling to grow up,

407
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:27,500
he can only hide in games.

408
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,400
However, when you have to go back to reality to take on responsibility,

409
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,000
you'll realize that you can't do anything.

410
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,200
It's a terrible feeling.

411
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,200
I'm sorry!

412
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:48,700
You know that we can spend money to purchase armor in games.

413
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,400
We can spend time to train our characters,

414
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,200
and start another round if we die.

415
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,500
But in reality, we only have one life.

416
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:03,970
If we miss our opportunities in the workplace, it's gone forever.

417
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:09,010
An enemy has been slain.

418
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,000
Aren't you playing anymore?

419
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:21,930
I feel like I've accomplished nothing.

420
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,200
I feel the opposite from you.

421
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,900
I feel that if there's a will, there's a way.

422
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,600
Stay here by yourself then!

423
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,700
Luo Jia, open the door!

424
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,400
I know you're inside.

425
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,500
I have something to tell you.

426
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,900
I don't want to hear it.

427
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,400
Open the door.

428
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,400
I don't want to.

429
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,100
Open the door! I have to give you an explanation.

430
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,900
Just say it then! Let's see if it's something I want to hear.

431
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:30,000
Open the door! I want to give you an explanation face-to-face.

432
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,560
What is there to explain?

433
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,110
If I take on this project,

434
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:48,000
I'll definitely subcontract it to you, for sure!

435
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,300
Scram!

436
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,300
Goddess,

437
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,500
what are you doing up so late?

438
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,200
Ungrateful Child, are you trying to scare me to death?

439
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,100
What medicine are you taking?

440
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,800
It's to lower my blood pressure.

441
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,200
You didn't even think to call before coming back.

442
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,600
Did you have dinner yet?

443
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,400
- Where's Jiajia?
- She told me to scram.

444
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:16,800
Then... did you really scram?

445
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,640
I lied to her.

446
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:24,960
Then I...

447
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,520
I really went to apologize to her,

448
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,400
but she wouldn't accept it.

449
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,000
Then how did you apologize to her?

450
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,200
I told her that I lied to her because of work.

451
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,800
If I took on this project, I would definitely subcontract it to her.

452
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,600
Isn't that enough?

453
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,000
What's wrong, Grandma?

454
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:57,850
She was right to tell you to scram.

455
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:03,500
Ungrateful Child, for people...

456
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,800
Love is love.

457
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,800
Work is work.

458
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:14,200
Even a fool knows these are two separate things.

459
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,200
Grandma, teach me how to fix this.

460
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,500
It's just three words.

461
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,640
"I am sorry." Right?

462
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:36,500
"I miss you."

463
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:43,200
You're such a fool, an Ungrateful Child.

464
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,800
"I miss you?"

465
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,700
I miss you.

466
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,800
How can I possibly say that?

00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:59,200
♫  Who would abruptly break off the lingering care of the past?  ♫

476
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,000
♫  You deserved it, someone said  ♫

477
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:13,400
♫  It would be for the best that the story stays unfinished  ♫

478
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:20,000
♫  Those words were spoken halfway  ♫

479
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,800
♫  When those few words reached the tip of the tongue  ♫

480
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,400
♫  It would take several years to accept  ♫

481
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:34,100
♫  Whose heart is closed midway from now on  ♫

482
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:41,400
♫  Locking up all the endless insomnia in the past?  ♫

483
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:48,200
♫  Some words are only spoken halfway  ♫

484
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:52,200
♫  To adjust the emotional intensity afterwards  ♫

485
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,600
♫  Just air-dry it slowly with time  ♫

486
00:43:55,600 --> 00:44:02,400
♫  Whose heart will miss a half from now on  ♫

487
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,400
♫  Just let it totally submerge  ♫

488
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:11,000
♫  My remaining dimness  ♫

489
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:16,760
♫  The other half  ♫

490
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:23,000
♫  The other half  ♫

491
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,500
♫  The other half  ♫
