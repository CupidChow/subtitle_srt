Grandma,

23
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,790
what's wrong?

24
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,930
Zhou Rui.

25
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,870
I had a dream about your grandpa.

26
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,820
He came to see me.

27
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,550
Next time, you dream of him again, tell him,

28
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:44,120
"Don't fight me on this! I'm looking for you, too."

29
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:54,300
The ring is in that box.

30
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:59,090
Give it to your future wife!

31
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,550
Give it to her yourself then.

32
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,150
I can't be attending to so many things anymore.

33
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,110
I've been held back all my life.

34
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,460
In my next life,

35
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:18,790
I'm going to be someone who does as they please.

36
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,520
What do you think this is?

37
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,640
A limited-edition pin.

38
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:12,510
I went to every store in this city to ask if they had this style and they said they didn't.

39
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,700
I said, "No! That won't do! You'd better get me one today!"

40
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,560
Then they just called me and said they had one sent over.

41
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,020
I said, "Hurry! Hurry! Deliver it to me, I'm still here. Hurry up!"

42
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,150
It's fate that God is helping me.

43
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,340
It's a breakup gift.

44

For all of your future pursuers.

50
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:10,810
Let them see how great your ex-boyfriend was to you.

51
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:14,460
When they see this, they'll know this is the minimum standard they should uphold.

52
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,000
The minimum standard.

53
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,910
Come on, pack it up!

00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:34,640
Yao Yao, you have to let me sort everything out.

57

Don't push me!

58
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,960
I understand.

59
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,480
It's okay.

60
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,010
There's something I still want to say.

61
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,960
Even if I have a chance to say it in the future,

62
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,220
I don't think I'd be able to say it.

63
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:37,030
The birthday on my ID is fake.

64
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:42,490
I followed my mom when she remarried again and again,

65
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:46,640
and the information on my ID was changed again and again.

66
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,010
I was bullied since I was young.

67
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,310
It's true.

68
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:01,090
So we shouldn't be saying that neither of us isn't good enough for the other.

69
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,000
This can be considered our child, can't it?

70
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,590
It looks like you.

71
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,420
Can you raise him for me?

72
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,340
Didn't I tell you not to come?

73
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:02,080
Why didn't you tell me you were this sick?

74
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,310
Should I take you to the hospital?

75
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,980
There's really no need.

76
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,870
I get fevers whenever my allergies become serious; I'll be better by tomorrow morning.

77
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,830
Even if your nose can endure it, will your stomach?

78
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,510
You have to eat something.

79
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,210
You have medicine in your house, don't you?

80
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,490
I should have some.

81
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,680
But I don't know where I put it and I can't find it.

82
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,740
Tell me the name of the medicine.

83
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,760
I'll get it delivered for you.

I'm suffering because my nose is too clogged up.

86
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,710
I'm going to nap for a few minutes. Eat without me!

Sure, I'll be free later, I'll take you out to have it cut.

I can't even find my shoes, so I can't go anywhere.

Tell Luo Jia to come here and cut it for me!

I read the instructions for the medicine; you can take it after eating.

All right then. Let's talk about the valuation today!

205

Chairman Liu, your valuation

206
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:11,970
is way different from what I expected.

207

I'm O&T's chairman.

Of course, I'm going to consider O&T's interests first.

Tell me what Huikang's floor price is.

00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:29,380
- Five billion.
- Five billion?

211
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:33,080
You won't get that much even if you robbed all four of the major banks.

212
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:39,190
Chairman Liu, the acquisition is only a win if both of us win.

213
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:43,510
With five billion, Huikang will truly be winning,

214
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,820
but O&T will lose everything.

215
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,760
The same can be said the other way around, too.

216
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,680
With one point five billion, O&T wins,

What is this?

220
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,270
This is a chip purchasing contract.

221
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:11,240
The total value is fifty million.

222
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,380
Huikang already paid in full,

223
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:18,140
but the other party doesn't have the chips at all.

224
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:21,470
This is truly a fraud.

225
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,760
What does that have to do with me?

226
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,420
O&T doesn't work in the chip business, either.

227
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:31,570
Right! This doesn't have anything to do with O&T.

228
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:35,280
However, to your son, Liu Yu Fan,

229
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,530
it has something to do with it.

230
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:50,200
Originally, I just wanted to do Yu Fan a favor.

231
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,070
But I didn't expect him to dig such a deep hole for me.

232
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:57,850
In the event that Liu Yu Fan's fifty million hole does turn out to be true,

233
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:00,870
you probably dug it yourself, didn't you?

234
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:04,290
This isn't just a fifty million hole.

How about this?

00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,360
Let's do a fixed price

237

of three point five billion.

238
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,110
Do you think I'm worth that price?

It's either I go to jail or he does.

Sister Gu said that you were the one who allowed her to take her annual leave.

241

The new financial manager said they never even saw Liu Yu Fan's contract at all.

242
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,360
The legal department also doesn't know anything.

243

I haven't seen a single chip thus far.

244

So we have to call a stop to Sanke's project.

245
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,660
Whether or not we stop the project, you don't have to worry about that for now.

246
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,440
As long as O&T's acquisition of Huikang is already firmly established,

247
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,060
we'll have everything under control.

O&T's acquisition of Huikang has something to do with Liu Yu Fan?

Even if a tiger is evil, it still doesn't eat its own son.

255

Liu Feng's condition for acquiring us

256
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,900
is exactly for me to nullify Liu Yu Fan's contract

257
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,340
and get rid of his notorious record.

258
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,140
You knew that Liu Yu Fan didn't have the chips early on, didn't you?

259
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:55,670
I told you that this was a fraud.

260
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:58,130
I signed the contract, so I'm the one who has to bear the consequences.

261
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:00,700
I'm the one being buried in the hole you dug.

262
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,200
This... How can you say it's a hole?

263
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,300
It's an aircraft carrier.

264
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,840
We're both already on the ship.

265
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:12,960
Think about it! Liu Yu Fan might not have any chips,

266
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,270
but Liu Feng does.

267
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:17,810
Do you need me to explain it any further?

268
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:25,260
President Lin, you're playing with fire.

269

(TN: Presenting a bold front to conceal a weak defense)

This isn't an "empty city" strategy.

271
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,770
This is known as borrowing the resources of an ally to attack a common enemy.

272

Isn't it just fifty million? It isn't like we don't have fifty million to—

This is our policy. Cooperate for a bit!

You won't have to this time.

Alright.

310
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:24,110
What I actually want is for Jieke's offer to always be higher than Huikang's.

311
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,000
You want Jieke to accompany you to a bid?

312
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,990
- Yes.
- However, I don't do anything illegal.

313
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:41,220
Why come to me when there are so many companies bidding?

314

Since you're here, it means that I came to the right person.

that your proposal is rigid and mediocre.

317
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:57,380
Even if you manage to get shortlisted, isn't it all just for practice in the end?

00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,640
Make me an offer!

320
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:14,080
Are you that confident that I'd be willing to work with you?

321
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,850
It's because we're the same kind of people.

322
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:24,820
We understand that the most important thing is to secure the money in our pockets.

323
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:30,950
Is this what Luo Jia wants, too?

324
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:35,040
It's what I want, which is also what Huikang wants.

325
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,930
After this order is done,

326
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:41,050
the legend of Zhou Rui from the south and Luo Jia from the north will go up in smoke.

327
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,190
They'll withdraw from the sales industry.

328
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:56,160
I want twenty percent.

329
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,000

330
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,200
[Sealing Strip]

331
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,660
Let's finish our coffee.

332
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:03,840
Did Grandma really want to do this?

333
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:09,520
Grandma said this is the freedom that she wants.

334
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:14,010
This way, her soul can travel the world.

335
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:32,620
I can hold her,

336
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,610
but I can't scatter her (ashes).

337
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:59,420
Actually, what I want the most is to take a picture with Ungrateful Child.

338
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:02,880
A picture of the three of us.

339
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,830
But why?

340
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:25,300
You clearly had so many ways to tell me

341
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,720
but why didn't you say anything? Why?

342
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:41,220
Zhou Rui, do you know?

343
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:45,750
You're so self-righteous that you believe you're always doing the right thing.

344
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:49,190
But to Grandma, and to me,

345
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:51,180
even to your teacher and Fang Wei,

346
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,790
you never did your best for us.

347
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:01,070
I know I was wrong now.

348
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:09,350
Do you know why I had to break up with you?

349
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,860
It's because I always put myself first.

350
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:21,440
Zhou Rui, you finally admit that you're selfish.

351
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:25,230
You guys gave up a lot for me.

352
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:27,570
You guys saw me move forward.

353
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,250
But I never looked back at you guys.

354
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:36,180
It's too late.

355
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:39,280
It's way too late.

356
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,510
Grandma is gone.

357
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:51,410
The only connection between us is broken.

358
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:57,130
I won't follow you.

359
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:05,590
From now on, let's walk our own paths.

360
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,390
Also,

361
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,720
I decided to accept Du Heng.

362
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:32,040
You don't have to tell me this, do you?

363
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:37,200
If I don't tell you, whom am I going to say it to?

364
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:56,350
♫  I always think of how it began  ♫

365
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:59,370
♫  On one summer night  ♫

366
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:03,620
♫  Was it joy or sadness?  ♫

367
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:07,500
♫  It boomerangs in my heart  ♫

368
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,540
♫  Everything about you  ♫

369
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:16,840
♫  Is the same as when I met you  ♫

370

♫  Everyone says love is just a dream  ♫

371
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:24,740
♫  But after meeting you  ♫

372
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,370
♫  I believe in this dream  ♫

373
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:29,190
Grandma told me

374
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:31,920
not to let you suffer for one bit!

375
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,780
♫  Let us escape from this world  ♫

376
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:42,750
♫  From those who are too crazy  ♫

377
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:47,980
♫  I want to ask the wind how far it will blow  ♫

378
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:52,390
Grandma told me to not let you suffer one bit!

379
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,250
♫  I want to ask the garden in my dreams  ♫

♫  I'll only leave my love for you  ♫

♫  I want to ask how many times this day will repeat itself  ♫

384
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:17,340
♫  But I dare not ask how far it is  ♫

385
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:22,250
♫  It is between you and I  ♫

386
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:25,020

not to let you suffer one bit!

388

♫  It's not that I'm not brave  ♫

393
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,800
Director Fang, please!

394
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,460
I am the manager of this building.

395
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,820
This is my business card.

396
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:23,350
Mr. Lei from your Administrative Department already contacted us.

397
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:25,290
If there is anything you want to change

398
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:27,740
or add to your home, just let me know.

399
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:30,810
You can check if everything is here first.

400
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:34,070
This should be everything.

401
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:36,410
If everything is good, please sign here.

402
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,040
Okay.

403
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,240
- Then I won't disturb you any further.
- Okay. Thank you.

404
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,100
It's my pleasure.

405
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:50,330
Rest well! Goodbye.

406
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:31,410
Breaking news about the weather.

407
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:34,320
It's expected that in the next twelve hours, many areas in Inner Mongolia

408
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,660
will be affected with strong wind.

409
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,840
I'm going to the bidding tomorrow.

410
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,660
I know.

411
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:44,800
This is your first time, and it definitely won't be your last.

412
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:47,720
I want to ask you something.

413
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,900
Go ahead!

414
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:55,250
Did you think that I wasn't suited for sales since the beginning?

415
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:58,230
...and reinforce your doors and windows in case the wind blows.

416
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:00,670
There isn't a very high bar to be a salesperson.

417
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:03,170
You're the only person who would know if it's right for you.

418
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:06,330
However, I have to thank you for giving me this opportunity.

419
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:08,740
How you use this opportunity,

420
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:11,210
it all depends on you.

421
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:16,470
The differences between professions are huge.

422
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:18,640
What exactly are you trying to ask?

423
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:21,760
I got it!

424
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:34,270
Listeners, please be careful and be safe!
