[Episode 34]

22
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,210
Come, Xiao Shi! Let me introduce you.

23
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,210
Gao Jian, my colleague from Hangzhou, is an IT guy.
(TN: IT = Information Technology)

24
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,790
If even he can't come up with a plan to solve your problem,

25
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,340
I don't think anyone else can.

26
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,090
Of course, you can also look for him if you ever need to level up or beat some monsters in a game.

27
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,330
- Nice to meet you!
- Nice to meet you!

28
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,810
Look!

29
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:06,530
Your problem still lies in the collar.

30
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,590
If you can upgrade your system through a smart middleware,

31
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:13,880
not only will you be able to locate it, but you can even monitor their temperature, as well as diseases and pests.

32
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,120
Of course, even the temperature and humidity of the meadow aren't a problem.

33
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,620
Most importantly, you said your electric collars use a radio signal system.

34
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,690
I looked it up and there are geomagnetic abnormalities across a meadow with circumference of dozens of meters.

35
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,490
So the radio signal is extremely unstable.

36
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,280
We're using Beidou Navigation Satellite System this time.

37
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,680
It has an automatic adjusting function.

38
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,070
- Then I'll go back to discuss this with the herdsmen.
- Sure! I'll go with you.

39
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,700
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

40
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,830
- See you!
- Bye.

41
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,900
Let me see if this one is mine.
[Jieke Company]

42
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,940
It's mine!

43
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,740
What did the old comrade say?

44
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,900
International relations won't be too great or too terrible.

45
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,610
- Don't you think so?
- That's right.

46
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,360
They talk about cutting off the supply all the time.

47
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,520
They're so good at that.

48
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,880
- But when did they actually cut us off? That's how it is!
- That's right. You're right.

49
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,720
Right? Who in the market still believes it?

50
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,330
In my opinion, this isn't planning ahead in case of trouble.

51
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,570
- It's called having groundless worries.
- Absolutely correct!

52
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,290
That's right. We can't do anything if we read too much into it.

53
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,700
- The company doesn't have the extra money to stock up anyways.
- Right, it's pointless to discuss this.

54
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,930
Ants would find another home and rats would run around before an earthquake.

55
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:35,710
We aren't planning for trouble nor having groundless worries.

56
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,260
This is called recognizing the small hints before things start to develop.

57
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,960
Whether or not it'll really get cut off,

58
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,030
once you look at the supplier's supply graph for these past six months,

59
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,620
it'll be clear to you.

60
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,930
Director Wei, can we really trust the data from our supplier?

61
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,640
Rare things are valuable.

62
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,370
Hoarding goods and speculating are the most basic methods of sales.

63
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,820
What you said is right.

64
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,010
- That's right.
- There are regulations for pricing.

65
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,950
Suppliers think about quantity for the greater the quality, the wider the road.

66
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:10,360
All you think about is raising the prices. It seems like you're wasting your talents in the sales department.

67
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,410
You should work in the marketing department.

68
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,570
I have half an hour before I'm done. I'll head over there after.
[Duo Duo has a surgery today. Don't forget.]

69
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,700
I'll be there soon.
[Duo Duo has a surgery today. Don't forget.]

70
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,630
Han Xiao Meng, check our inventory and see how many months we can last.

71
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,180
Okay.
[Bei Yao Yao]

72
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,880
I'll give you one month.

73
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,740
One month?

74
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,680
One month!

75
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,500
- What do you mean one month?
- That short?

76
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,380
- No way it can be for only one month.
- It shouldn't be that short.

77
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,770
- Meeting adjourned!
- I'll treat this month like it's my lifetime.

78
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:54,450
- Such a long meeting, but we didn't even solve anything.
- Fine! Such a waste of time.

79
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:58,290
- Right? We haven't even eaten yet. Forget it!
- Nothing was resolved and what one month?

80
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,230
- Let's go!
- What are we eating later?

81
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:03,040
Whatever is fine.

Come in.

84
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,980
Director Wei, is this a good time?

85
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,880
What is it?

86
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,000
This is the current data of our company's inventory that I've organized.

87
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,700
Didn't I tell Han Xiao Meng to prepare them?

88
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,620
You notified us of a meeting the day before yesterday, so I thought you might need it.

89
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,190
You also think that they'll cut off our supply for real?

90
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,880
Be honest!

91
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,140
I just think that I'm a salesman.

92
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,300
- So?
- So I might not know how much inventory other people want,

93
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,570
but I must know how much inventory I have.

94
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,200
This way, I'll feel at ease.

95
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,880
Alright, just leave it here.

- I'll look at it tomorrow.
- Alright, I'll head out now.

She's undergoing her operation today.

and that we're tight on inventory.

Then you should find a way to increase the inventory

What do I explain?

162
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,820
I can only explain that it's because Director Luo is a big shot,

Will the client believe that?

You wanted to have an attack on Jieke and subcontract Huikang's business.

That's because you can, but I can't.

I can't do that. Choose something else!

We can't try to force the two together.

319
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,950
A plan is a plan while it's human nature to do things out of habit.

320
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:27,240
I realized something after so many years in sales.

321
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,610
You can't ever try to compete with human nature.

What do you mean "primary industrial model"?

325
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:42,610
Do you know how many tons of beef China imports in a year?

326
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:46,870
Do you know how many herdsmen sell cows into the city each year?

327
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:50,310
Afterwards, I talked to Xiao Shi for a long time.

328
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:54,140
I told him about my classmate's experience at Huawei.

329
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:57,790
Huawei has base stations in Europe, America, Africa, Middle East, and Asia Pacific.

330
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,640
They've already occupied half the world.

331
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,780
However, not many people know that there is a hidden story about the choice

332
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,870
behind each base station.

333
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:12,030
During the war in Libya, the Chinese employees were the last to evacuate

334
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:15,530
because they wanted to ensure communication.

335
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:18,450
They didn't have any signal when they installed their base station in the Amazon.

336
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,330
They were in there for seven to eight days once they went in.

337
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:23,430
Everyone was scared for his lives.

338
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:27,500
Venezuela's currency depreciated and became extremely volatile.

339
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,310
They couldn't even afford a piece of paper,

340
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:32,860
but they needed to persevere in there.

341
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,660
When the nuclear power plant collapsed after Japan's earthquake,

342
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,460
Huawei's people were the only ones who headed towards the disaster area.

Just let me finish what I started!

Finish what you started?

354
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,590
Zhou Rui, well said!

355
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:35,160
But you have to understand that everything you have today started with me,

so don't end it with yourself.

357

Sometimes, I wonder what the significance of a caravan is.

358
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:57,460
The pioneer must have sacrificed a lot to gain even less back.

359
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:02,120
In terms of victory or defeat, defeat is when you choose to give up,

360
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:06,350
and victory is usually left for the latecomers.

My dad rarely calls me, so it must be something important.

00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:35,240
- You're back?
- I'm back.

479
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:39,440
I need you to attend the board meeting tomorrow.

480
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:44,850
Master, if it's just for show,

481
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:47,160
can I not attend?

482
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:50,980
I'll be saying some things tomorrow that you should come and hear.

483
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:54,310
I don't want to hear about anything else unless it's about cloud computing right now.

484
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:57,260
It's about you and Wei Yan's losing or winning.

485
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,330
You still don't want to attend?

486
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,150
Even if he loses, I won't win, either.

487
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:07,950
We're announcing at the board meeting tomorrow

488
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:10,240
that you'll be taking charge of the North China Region.

489
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,760
What about Wei Yan?

490
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,550
The relevant agenda PowerPoint slides will be sent to the group.

491
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:16,370
Take a look yourself!

492
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:20,510
Master, just directly tell me what I have to do tomorrow.

493
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,970
Just support me!

494
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:25,140
Of course, I'll support you, but— Hello?

495
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,750
Hello? Master?

❝ One Half ❞ by Mo Fei Ding Lu

497
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:53,800
♫  The sun has only shone halfway  ♫

498
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:59,510
♫  The freckles on my face are bright and dark  ♫

499
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,880
♫  Oh...  ♫

500
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:07,820
♫  Who sung the song halfway through  ♫

501
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:13,600
♫  Leaving behind the roars of the chorus in an empty room  ♫

502
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,720
♫  I...  ♫

503
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:23,580
♫  Slowly tidied up the embarrassment of the dispersing crowd  ♫

504
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:31,600
♫  Who would abruptly break off the lingering care of the past?  ♫

505
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,310
♫  You deserved it, someone said  ♫

506
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:45,750
♫  It would be for the best that the story stays unfinished  ♫

507
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:52,450
♫  Those words were spoken halfway  ♫

508
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:56,290
♫  When those few words reached the tip of the tongue  ♫

509
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:59,780
♫  It would take several years to accept  ♫

510
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:06,530
♫  Whose heart is closed midway from now on  ♫

511
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:13,930
♫  Locking up all the endless insomnia in the past?  ♫

512
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:20,620
♫  Some words are only spoken halfway  ♫

513
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:24,540
♫  To adjust the emotional intensity afterwards  ♫

514
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:27,980
♫  Just air-dry it slowly with time  ♫

515
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:34,660
♫  Whose heart will miss a half from now on  ♫

516
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:36,790
♫  Just let it totally submerge  ♫

517
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:42,370
♫  My remaining dimness  ♫

518
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:48,820
♫  The other half  ♫

519
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:55,610
♫  The other half  ♫

520
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:03,380
♫  The other half  ♫
