Zhou Rui's people stole our bid proposal but they didn't look at it.

President Chen, I stole the bid proposal.

No one else was involved.

Cui Long stole the bidding documents because he's stupid.

He didn't have any bad intentions.

109

He just wanted to help us to win.

110

Fang Wei was returning the bid proposal.

111
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:01,500
I swear that no one open the bid proposal.

112
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,950
Cui Long doesn't have much experience.

113
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,090
He wouldn't have understood the bid proposal.

114
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:09,760
I should have stopped him, but I didn't.

115
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,040
President Chen, it was all my fault.

Friendship!

117
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,910
You went to return the bid proposal, so you aren't at fault.

118
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:41,450
You're stupid and not mature enough, so you aren't responsible, either.

119
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,170
You didn't steal nor return the bid proposal,

120
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,970
so you also aren't responsible.

121
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,580
Then who is responsible?

122
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,430
Who should take the blame?

123
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,200
Does he know that I'm back?

124
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,650

It's always the apprentice who understands the Master.

132
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:43,900
Where would he be if he isn't at the company?

133
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,760
I don't know.

134
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,470
As an apprentice, you should know that

135
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,370
it's important to report all problems to the master.

136
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:57,620
But he, as a master, doesn't understand this.

137
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:01,480
Others may not know this, but Director Zhou isn't like that.

138
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,580
Why?

139
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,350
It's because he would solve the problem first.

140
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,550
Then it seems like

141

He called all of us over to ask questions.

144
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,600
And am I the only one he didn't ask for?

145
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:41,270
What he meant was

It depends on others now.

00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:18,040
Then it depends on Director Luo, doesn't it?

00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,250
Here! For you.

165
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,440
- What is this?
- Open it and see.

166
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:55,610
You gave me a pair of shoes?

167
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,990
It's for wishing you a meteoric rise in your career.

168
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:01,600
Isn't it also so I can go as far away as I want with it?

169
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,580
What is this for?

170
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,340
You are my friend and client.

171
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:22,470
"A friend in need is a friend indeed," let alone a client.

172
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:25,290
This gift is so costly; I can't accept it.

173
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:31,070
Tell me! What kind of gift would you accept?

174
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,600
Does Huikang have a chance?

175
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:44,080
In the end, I'm still a client to you.

176
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,870
I was planning to tell you this.

177
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:55,240
If Zhou Rui offers cakes, I can't reject.

178
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,570
I understand.

179
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:03,410
I've decided not to investigate Jieke anymore.

180
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,750
- Sorry!
- It's okay.

181
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,210
Hello?

182
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,810
Okay.

183
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,640
I understand.

184
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,710
Sorry, President Du!

185
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,450
I can't have dinner with you.

186
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:28,720
No problem! It's just a dinner.

187
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,240
We can do it on any day.

188
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,980
However, I can't accept your gift, either.

189
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:41,090
President Du.

190
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:42,890
What's the matter?

191
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,040
President Du,

192
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,680
I'm certain that

193
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,780
Zhou Rui didn't open our bid documents.

194
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,540
I think this isn't important anymore, is it?

195
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:06,610
I just think that Zhou Rui is lucky.

196
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,860
Jieke is lucky.

197
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,880
Are you stalking me?

198
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,240
- What do you want?
- I'm going home.

199
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,290
Your house is over there.

200
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,950
Starting today, you go back to your own house.

201
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,490
I didn't know President Du was meeting with you,

202
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:06,520
but I want to know what you both talked about.

203
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,370
What do you think we said?

204
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,760
Said you stole the bid documents?

205
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,330
Said he wants to sue you all?

206
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,150
It's the best to lock you all up in jail.

207
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:23,670
- Before I go to jail, you need to hear me out.
- I don't want to hear anything you have to say.

208
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,380
What's wrong?

209
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,530
You don't even know what I'm sad about.

210
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,760
I want to know.

211
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,310
However, I don't want you to know.

212
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,620
It's urgent. It's urgent.

213
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,430
It's urgent. It's... it's urgent.

214
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,700
Ungrateful Child, Bad Boy!

215
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,920
Can you come to help me?

216
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,630
What's wrong, Grandma?
[I...]

217
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,130
Hurry!
[Know You...]

218
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,810
Ken Takakura's show is starting soon.

219
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:27,790
Help me to adjust the wifi.

220
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,510
Okay. Hold on!

221
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,420
Hurry up! Ken Takakura show is going to start.

222
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:35,130
- Wait a second Grandma.
- Come to help me fix the wifi.

223
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,080
Okay.

224
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,920
I'll take care of it.

225
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,430
But can you help me first?

226
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:43,590
Glue these words onto the window.

227
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,220
The content is

228
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,130
"I know you better than yourself."

229
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:51,560
"Luo Jia, I'm sorry! I miss you."

230
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,630
Can you help me glue them?

231
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:59,090
Why won't you tell her in person?

232
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:02,970
She didn't give me a chance to tell her in person.

233
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,790
You glue them.

234
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:08,060
And text her to tell her to come to the window side to see.

235
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:11,250
Then... then help me... help me first with Ken Takakura.

236
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,400
- Find it for me.
- You glue them first.

237
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,570
No, you help me first.

238
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,840
- Grandma—
- Search for Ken Takakura for me.

239
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,460
- Grandma, can you help me first?
- Search for Ken Takakura for me first.

240
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,590
- You help me first.
- Do them at the same time.

241
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:24,250
- Help me first! You help me first. You help me first.
- Okay. Fine.

242
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,720
Go to glue them.

243
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,570
Glue them, Grandma!

244
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:32,150
- Make sure you send the text after you glued them.
- What with you, me?

245
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,400
Jia Jia, go to the window and take a look.

246
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,500
Bad boy wants you to see something.

247
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:14,400
[I want to understand you more than myself.]
[Luo Jia, you've wronged me.]

248
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:22,140
Grandma, your Ken Takakura is back.

249
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,820
Okay. Okay! I glued them all for you already.

250
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:36,310
"What you saw is the sincerity from my heart."

251
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,500
"I already saw your honesty."

252
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
[I want to understand you more than myself.]
[Luo Jia, you've wronged me.]

253
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,600
Grandma! You glued them all wrong.

254
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,300
You glued them all wrong, Grandma!

255
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,800
"Word written in black and white are ironclad."

256
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,900
- Say it!
- I know what to say in a bit.

257
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,100
Director Zhou, if I quit,

258
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,000
would you survive this obstacle?

259
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,500
It's inevitable.

260
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,000
How do I restore the company's reputation?

261
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,800
How do I make up for the company's economic losses?

262
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,800
Do you think after you quit, it'll solve everything?

263
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,500
President Chen didn't do anything about that.

264
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:02,700
I think he's waiting for what you have to say.

265
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,600
What can I say?

266
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,880
Wait to be scolded then.

267
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,800
W-We won! We won!

268
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,000
Won! Won! We w... won!

269
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,100
- Won what?
- Our cloud processing solution won the bid.

270
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,800
Wow! What's going on?

271
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,000
This is like a roller coaster.

272
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
What does Huikang want?

273
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,200
I don't know about anything else, but they aren't suing you anymore.

274
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,800
Director Zhou.

275
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:03,200
Director Zhou? We won! Aren't you happy?

276
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,800
You and you! Hug him for me.

277
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,200
- Hug him hard.
- Okay!

278
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,800
Don't, don't, don't! No need to do it, Baby!

279
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,000
No! Don't!

280
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,500
- I don't need to quit.
- Director Zhou!

281
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,200
- Director Zhou, what should we do now?
- Let's go find funding separately.

282
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,600
After we accept this order, it means we might expand.

283
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,000
Let go of me! Let go quickly!

284
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,900
Be quick! Be quick! Let's go!

285
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,000
Show off!

286
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,200
Enough, enough!

287
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,220
Aren't you going to win a plush toy for me?

288
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,000
I don't play that! I can buy a plush toy for you instead.

289
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,400
This is being reborn.

290
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,200
Get me a plush toy to remember this moment!

291
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,400
I want him?

292
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,000
Can you get it?

293
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,100
Him?

294
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,200
- This one.
- This one?

295
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,700
- The blue one.
- This one?

296
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,000
No problem! How do I play this?

297
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,150
Why are you standing there?

298
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:17,100
Go to exchange for coins?

299
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:21,950
Yao Yao.

300
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:26,080
If I get this plush toy, can you do something for me?

301
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,800
- Speak!
- I want you to be my girlfriend.

302
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,100
♫  I always think of how it began  ♫

303
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,200
♫  On one summer night  ♫

304
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,400
♫  Was it joy or sadness?  ♫

305
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,300
♫  It boomerangs in my heart  ♫

306
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,200
♫  Everything about you  ♫

307
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,600
♫  Is the same as when I met you  ♫

308
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:14,200
♫  Everyone says love is just a dream  ♫

309
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,600
♫  But after meeting you,  ♫

310
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,400
♫  I believe in this dream  ♫

311
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,800
♫  While the moon is bright  ♫

312
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,600
Thank you for calling me.

313
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,800
I know. I know!

314
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,380
Okay.

315
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,160
Luo Jia!

316
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,400
You're just going to let Jieke win?

317
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,200
- Okay.
- You're going to let Zhou Rui win?

318
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,000
Okay. Thank you. Good bye.

319
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,300
Yes. I decided not to pursue the matter.

320
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:51,000
We have evidence and witnesses, but we aren't suing just because you said so?

321
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:57,300
Wang Yi Nan, you already have a stain.

322
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,600
Aren't you afraid to be in debt and immune to it?

323
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:04,200
It's the same for Zhou Rui's bids.

324
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,000
If Jieke and Huikang both lose the bid

325
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,700
then why will we sue them?

326
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,600
I'm doing it for the company's reputation.

327
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,800
Wang Yi Nan,

328
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,400
can you please stop.

329
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,000
You can get revenge against Zhou Rui,

330
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,400
but don't get the company invovled.

331
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,700
Why are you helping Zhou Rui?

332
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,700
What did Zhou Rui do to you that you keep gunning him?

333
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,300
I just want to refuse to let it go!

334
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,000
What's the matter?

335
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,150
Then I'll be truthful.

336
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:56,200
Zhou Rui's people took the bid proposal but did not open it.

337
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,400
So you opened it.

338
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,000
Yes.

339
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,200
President Lin is with a guest.

340
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:32,810
- I'll be leaving President Lin.
- Okay.

341
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,200
Brother, your eyes...

342
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,800
Come in!

343
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,500
What's the matter?

344
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,400
The people who know that I opened the bid proposal are only you and Director Luo.

345
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,400
Right now, O&T gave the bid to Fast Future Technology.

346
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,600
Among the three of us, someone must have done something.

347
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,540
Do you have evidence?

348
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,600
I don't.

349
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:59,700
But it is obvious that Luo Jia and Zhou Rui must be working together.

350
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,700
President Lin,

351
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,840
I may not like Huikang,

352
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,190
but I'm loyal to you.

353
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,500
In fact, Luo Jia isn't wrong by doing this.

354
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:18,000
I really don't want to go through the trouble of suing Jieke.

355
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,500
As for your loyalty, we'll see how you take care of matters.

356
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,300
President Lin, give me your order.

357
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,000
Watch Luo Jia!

358
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,500
Find out what is going on with her and Zhou Rui.

359
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,000
- What are you doing? Are you spying on me?
- No...

360
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,700
- No, I'm here because—
- Come in and see!

361
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,000
I have plans.

362
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,600
- Come in. Come in and see.
- Really not necessary.

363
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,400
Good bye.

364
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,500
Okay.

365
00:31:58,170 --> 00:31:59,840
Come in!

366
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,400
President Lin,

367
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,200
it looks like you already know Fast Future Technology won the bid.

368
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:16,200
Good! It's good that both of you are here.

369
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,800
I'll be the mediator.

370
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,000
Let go of the past.

371
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,300
Whatever they are, don't criticize it as a matter of high principle.

372
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,490
Director Luo, be magnanimous!

373
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:32,100
Hand over all of your hard to deal with clients

374
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,400
to Wang Yi Nan.

375
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,300
I can.

376
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,400
Director Luo, let bygones be bygones!

377
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,400
Let bygones be bygones?

378
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,100
Do you really think I'm too idle?

379
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,000
Thank you for trusting me.

380
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,500
Go! You can go.

381
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,060
Yi Nan!

382
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,700
Make sure you do it well.

383
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,160
Do you still remember the O&T bidding meeting,

384
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,580
after then, what we said?

385
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,830
Congratulations!

386
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,420
Accept my condolences.

387
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:53,340
It's my turn to say congratulations.

388
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,230
Why aren't you suing Jieke?

389
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:05,500
It's because you didn't tear apart the bidding documents.

390
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:07,870
Who was it?

391
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,650
That isn't important.

392
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:17,110
What's important is that even Engineer Liu is on your side.

393
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:21,410
Your proposal really does touch the judges more than ours does.

394
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:23,460
Your tableware.

395
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:29,460
Wait a second!

396
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:33,630
Can you get me another drink?

397
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:37,070
What would you like?

398
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:39,130
The Jerk Special.

399
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,680
We don't have that.

400
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,670
No problem! Just get us another of the same thing.

401
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:54,040
I actually want to explain to you that the correct sequence of those papers is...

402
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:00,920
"I know you better than you know yourself.

403
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,160
Luo Jia,

404
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:05,350
I'm sorry!

405
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,750
I miss you."

406
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,020
Isn't it this?

407
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:28,710
This one is "you." Sure enough! The tricks learned from movies aren't effective.

408
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,990
I didn't expect grandma to tape them incorrectly.

409
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,660
Why didn't you tape them yourself?

410
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,470
Afraid I would see you?

411
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,190
No matter what you saw,

412
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:45,410
I just want you to know that I wanted to tell you...

413
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:49,090
I'm sorry. Really!

414
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:51,030
I'm sorry!

415
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:52,600
Don't!

416
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:55,600
I'm the one who should apologize to you.

417
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:00,050
Do you still want the Jerk Special?

418
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:02,290
I'll go and make it for you.

419
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:03,820
Sure!

420
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,340
Fine!

421
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,280
Help me with something.

422
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,440
- What can I do for you?
- I want to make a...

The base alcohol is tequila.

00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,510
A lady's glass with ice.

00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,910
Lemon.

427
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,810
- Add a bit more ice.
- Director Zhou.

428
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:58,830
She left.

429
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,130
Luo Jia.

430
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:16,080
What's wrong now?

431
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,820
Do you know how much trouble you caused?

432
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,500
I know.

433
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,050
Do you know that I was also dragged into this

434
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:29,590
because you wanted to change up the industry's rules?

435
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:32,720
I do know.

436
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,520
I'm such a fool.

437
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,700
I can't believe I'm still thinking of you during these times.

438
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,550
I know all those. Really!

439
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:50,330
I know.

00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:53,720
Zhou Rui.

No matter how far you get,

I hope you can leave a spot for me.

443

But I can't help but feel

444

00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:45,370
♫  Who sung the song halfway through  ♫

486
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:51,200
♫  Leaving behind the roars of the chorus in an empty room  ♫

487
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,180
♫  I...  ♫

488
00:42:54,180 --> 00:43:01,140
♫  Slowly tidied up the embarrassment of the dispersing crowd  ♫

489
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:09,120
♫  Who would abruptly break off the lingering care of the past?  ♫

490
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,860
♫  You deserved it, someone said  ♫

491
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:23,240
♫  It would be for the best that the story stays unfinished  ♫

492
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:29,960
♫  Those words were spoken halfway  ♫

493
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,900
♫  When those few words reached the tip of the tongue  ♫

494
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:37,320
♫  It would take several years to accept  ♫

495
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:44,060
♫  Whose heart is closed midway from now on  ♫

496
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:51,510
♫  Locking up all the endless insomnia in the past?  ♫

497
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:58,140
♫  Some words are only spoken halfway  ♫

498
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:02,070
♫  To adjust the emotional intensity afterwards  ♫

499
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:05,560
♫  Just air-dry it slowly with time  ♫

500
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:12,240
♫  Whose heart will miss a half from now on  ♫

501
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,300
♫  Just let it totally submerge  ♫

502
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:20,220
♫  My remaining dimness  ♫

503
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:26,040
♫  The other half  ♫

504
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,890
♫  The other half  ♫

505
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:40,390
♫  The other half  ♫
