[Episode 23]

22
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,320
Hello, Director Qiu!

23
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,420
Brother Tian's son, aren't you?

24
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,770
This little face! You're more energetic than your dad.

25
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,600
Not bad, Rascal!

26
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,270
Uncle Qiu, h-how long has it been since you've seen my dad?

27
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,990
Does it matter how long since we've seen each other?

28
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,370
I'd recognize him even if he were burned to ash.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,090
This girl is...

30
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,230
- This is—
- Hello, Uncle Qiu.

31
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,880
I'm Cui Long's girlfriend.

32
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,970
- Goodness!
- You have good taste!

33
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,240
You're better than your dad.

34
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,900
Look at this girl's eyes! They emanate a spiritual aura.

35
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,190
- Isn't that right?
- Uncle Qiu, I'm just pretending.

36
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:25,110
In sales, we have to pretend.

37
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,780
I'm actually quite silly and down-to-earth.

38
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,660
- Is that right, Brother Cui Long?
- Right.

39
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,400
Okay, let's do this! Since you get along now, get married sooner rather than later.

40
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,580
At that time, even if I don't have time to come, my gift will still be there.

41
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:41,590
- Uncle Qiu, the two of us—
- Uncle Qiu, Cui Long really does have something to ask of you.

42
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,730
Is there some trouble? Just say it! I'll help if I can.

43
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,090
Uncle Qiu, it's really nothing much, just that I'd like to ask—

44
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,820
We were originally going to get married, but his sales performance hasn't been good lately.

45
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,260
Thus his dad won't let him.

46
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,690
Brother Cui Tian won't agree?

47
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,550
Nonsense! I'll stop it.

48
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,490
I must.

49
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,860
Thank you, Uncle Qiu.

50
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,250
Did you notice that Uncle Qiu kept staring at my legs?

51
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,070
He even said your eyes are full of a spiritual aura.

52
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:23,020
Why do I only see a killing spirit hidden in your heart?

53
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,050
I'm not killing you, so what are you afraid of?

54
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,100
You talked about getting married again and again.

55
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,830
We endured a whole afternoon, but you didn't say a word about real business.

56
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,340
You could say it, but why didn't you say it?

57
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,530
- We couldn't talk business and you blame me?
- Since you said so, how am I supposed to explain it to my mom?

58
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:40,060
How will I explain? I can't explain it!

59
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,470
My whole world is collapsing.

60
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:46,700
Listen, Bei Yao Yao! This isn't over. I... I...

61
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,070
What's the meaning of this?

62
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,240
You don't agree?

63
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,240
Then we should go back to tell your Uncle Qiu right now.

64
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,350
It isn't too late for you to regret it.

65
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,930
I... I...

66
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,960
I just... I...

67
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,050
No.

68
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:16,640
If it weren't... If it weren't from some crummy sales,

69
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,710
would I have to Qiu plead my uncle... No, wait!
(TN: the word for Qiu and plead/beg sound similar in Chinese)

70
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,940
I mean to beg my ancestors, no...

71
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,230
What am I doing?

72
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,170
That's right! It's all for sales.

73
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:30,000
Why are you afraid of having some fun in the occasion?

74
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:35,130
How did your dad meet Uncle Qiu?

75
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,560
To tell you the truth, I don't really know him.

76
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:48,420
[Mother]

77
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,680
I'm doomed! Uncle Qiu has told my mom.

78
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,620
Transfer a thousand to me, I'll cover up this incident for you.
(TN: All amount are in Chinese yuan.)

79
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,400
Go away.

80
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,440
Mom, what's up? Miss me?

81
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,340
Long Long, you've really hurt me.

82
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,870
You want to get married, but your mom is the last one to know?

83
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:22,290
Mom, I was just... joking with Uncle Qiu.

84
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,930
And you believed it?

85
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,600
- You're too innocent.
 - Who's that girl?

86
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,700
- Can I meet her?
- Quiet! Stop!

87
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,800
Let me at least talk with her.

88
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,780
What girl? I'm by myself.

89
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,250
See? Mom, you're getting prettier.

90
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,010
Don't say that! It won't work.

91
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,480
Why do I see someone next to you?

92
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,910
Who is that? Is it her?

93
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,640
There isn't anyone; I'm talking live with you.

94
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,940
See? Where is there someone else? Look!

95
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,080
I just saw one.

96
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,900
- Don't lie to me anymore.
- I'm not.

97
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,180
Long Long? Long Long?

98
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,020
Hello, Auntie! I'm Bei Yao Yao.

99
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,540
Hello! Hello! I'm Long Long's mom.

100
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,940
- Hello, Auntie!
- Hello.

101
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:12,920
- Mom, we have to go see a customer soon. Let's talk later, okay?
 - Hey! This kid...

102
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,020
Give me the money.

103
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,350
I'm sure this is blackmail.

104
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,220
Okay. You can wait for an even bigger loss.

105
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,660
I'm going to report this to the police right now!

106
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,880
- Want something to drink?
- Coffee.

107
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,830
Are you sure?

108
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,050
I'm sure.

109
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,080
Okay.

110
00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:00,370
Isn't it too much to ask the client to make coffee for me?

111
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,170
I'm happy to serve.

112
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,540
Black coffee, no sugar, no cream.

113
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,600
It suits you.

114
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,100
Thanks.

115
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,030
Your face doesn't look all that well.

116
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,840
Aren't you resting well?

117
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,260
Is it because of the bid?

118
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:28,850
Indeed! However, with the client's help,

119
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:31,220
I might feel more relaxed.

120
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,110
So, is there anything...

121
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,930
I can help with?

122
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:50,190
I really do have an unreasonable request.

123
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,660
[Li Haochen]

124
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,380
Hello! Welcome aboard.

125
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,070
Hello!

126
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,230
Director Zhao, hello!

127
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,000
What a coincidence!

128
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,570
What do you need? I'll get it for you.

129
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:33,150
Director Zhao, do you need anything?

130
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,620
I need quiet.

131
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,630
Sir, please show your boarding pass.

132
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,860
Wait! We know each other.

133
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,210
The plane hasn't taken off yet, has it?

134
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,940
Ladies and Gentlemen, this flight is about to take off.

135
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,480
Welcome aboard!

136
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,370
- Sir, please go back to your seat.
- Fine!

137
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,880
Sister, I won't disturb you then; you rest first.

138
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,160
We can talk after the flight.

139
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,910
Your seat is over there.

140
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,840
Please sit in your assigned seat.

141
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:09,390
- Please put your carry-on in the overhead bin or under the seat.
- You can look at the document after the flight.

142
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:13,530
Do not place them in the aisles or near the emergency exits.

143
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:17,480
Director Zhu, I'm about to turn off my phone. Let's talk later!

144
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,220
We will assist you.

145
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,400
Please sit in your seat first to allow passengers to pass through.

146
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,890
I have a first-class ticket.

147
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:32,110
Ladies and Gentlemen, please take your seat according to your seat number.

148
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,860
Your seat number is on the overhead compartment.

149
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,070
Please make sure your luggage is stored securely.

150
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,720
Director Zhao,

151
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,530
do you like putting on facial masks?

152
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:05,410
I'll give you a set when we get back to Beijing.

153
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:16,210
If you want to chat about skincare, I'll listen to you.

154
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:20,570
But if you're still clinging to me to talk about Jieke's proposal,

155
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,210
I'll move to that empty seat over there.

156
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,380
Sister,

157
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:31,610
I've seen how knowledgeable you are about skincare products.

158
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:36,380
If you don't want to chat with me, I'll just sit here and keep you company.

159
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:43,660
Director Zhao, is there anything I can help you with?

160
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,980
Sorry, it's fine now.

161
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,480
Okay. Just call me if you need anything.

162
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,190
Help me beautify my skin!

163
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:22,370
Sir, your phone!

164
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,830
Please help me pick it up.

165
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,020
Come in!

166
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,310
Close the door. Close the door!

167
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,570
- Xiao Yu, sit!
- Thanks, Director Zhou.

168
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,920
Director Zhou, is there some big plan?

169
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,550
Why are we so secretive?

170
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,020
Where's Fang Wei?

171
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,580
He followed Zhao Lan on a business trip.

172
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,330
Li Hao Chen, what's the status?

173
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,710
After we met last time, I followed up with two phone calls.

174
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,840
He was very pleased after seeing our proposal.

175
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,380
I think he would vote for us.

176
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,390
What about you two?

177
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,250
You say it!

178
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,910
We got Director Qiu.

179
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,950
So quick?

180
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:35,510
We used a little bit of my dad's connection.

181
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,560
Took a little shortcut.

182
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,440
Is this connection strong?

183
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,670
This one vote is very important to us.

184
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:50,560
No problem! If it doesn't work in the end, I'll ask my dad to make a phone call.

185
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,080
If it doesn't work, we'll meet again to understand their internal situation.

186
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,720
No matter what, we'll get this vote.

187
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:00,170
Cui Long, people you know can connect with the customers.

188
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:03,690
However, in order to maintain the relationship, that's something you need to work on.

189
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,520
I know that.

190
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,170
Believe me!

191
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,380
I asked you to come in here

192
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,300
to teach you a new way to play the game.

193
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,910
Turn a show into reality.

194
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,270
Wealthy heirs are so lucky! They win from the beginning.

195
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:24,160
The cavalry from the East China Region is strong, too! They'll use any means to get the sale.

196
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,840
We're all using whatever means, why is there a need to be choosy?

197
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,580
Sister Yun, she's doubting me.

198
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,860
That means she's doubting you and doubting our entire North China Region.

199
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,630
I really can't stand it.

200
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,560
What was the matter with that guy just now?

201
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,950
Haven't you seen people like that?

202
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,570
Like him?

203
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:58,600
He must be flying for the first time.

204
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,970
He's very likely that female boss' male secretary.

205
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,670
Hello, Sir! Before we open the cabin door, please return to your seat.

206
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,720
- Thanks.
- Is there anything else to eat?

207
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,760
Yes. Please go back to your seat; we'll bring it to you.

208
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,300
It isn't for me.

209
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,330
Please serve it to my boss.

210
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,140
Director Zhao.

211
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:04,110
This is a light meal that the gentleman sitting next to you prepared for you.

212
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:11,320
Sister, I know you'll have to go directly to a meeting right after the flight.

213
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,900
You won't have time for a meal.

214
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,530
You even know what I'll be doing after I get off the plane?

215
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,820
Not only after you get off the plane.

216
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,980
I've planned tactics along all the roads you'll pass through.

217
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,660
See?

218
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,720
Good food, good wine, and beauty.

219
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,460
There's only what you can't think of, but nothing that I can't do.

220
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:38,460
You don't say! That young guy is pretty thoughtful.

221
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,790
It's for survival.

222
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,630
Zhou Rui taught you this?

223
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,980
My master said,

224
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,820
doing sales and chasing romance follow the same rule.

225
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,300
The client is my girlfriend.

226
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,540
You can have such an old girlfriend like me?

227
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:05,970
Among all the customers, you're the youngest and the most beautiful.

228
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:11,090
Let me tell you something!

229
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:15,990
If you use the same strategy

230
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:18,030
to chase after a girl or a client,

231
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:20,690
your master is pushing you to your death.

232
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,590
Okay.

233
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,890
Give me Jieke's proposal.

234
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,780
Thanks!

235
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:25,030
I can do it myself.

236
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,990
- How is it?
- They went.

237
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,670
You can't be softhearted when doing sales.

238
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:39,100
Those two have steely hearts.

239
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,850
Hello, Sister Yun.

240
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:48,000
The two little fish in Wei Yan's team have taken the bait.

241
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,730
They should've arrived at the O&T building.

242
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,300
- Watch out!
- Okay. I got it.

243
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:58,100
Rexin Yueyi Multimedia Co Ltd, Nanshanbei Culture Media Co Ltd.

244
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,400
Engineer Li!

245
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,860
Sorry! I'm here to bother you again.

246
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:11,590
The proposal I gave you last time, is there anything you think that should be amended?

247
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,380
Let us chat in the coffeeshop.

248
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,790
With your big belly, even I feel tired looking at it.

249
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,630
- Let's go!
- Okay.

250
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,880
Engineer Li, let me go to the restroom first.

251
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:40,750
- Hello, Engineer Li, I'm Kai Yang from Jieke.
- Hello!

252
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,290
- Han Xiao Meng.
- Hello!

253
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:44,590
Actually...

254
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,230
Why are you two here?

255
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:52,440
Engineer Li is also our client. So it was good to set up a meeting.

256
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,620
Engineer Li, I'm sorry!

257
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,420
You must find it so laughable

258
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,420
to see our company's internal conflicts.

259
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:07,030
Xiao Yun, O&T is Director Wei's client.

260
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:09,400
Are you trying to steal a deal?

261
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,820
I'm just a pregnant woman.

262
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,950
How could I steal anything from them?

263
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,660
X-Xiao Yun.

264
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:22,160
After all, aren't you all doing sales for Jieke?

265
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,190
This... So you're still the same family.

266
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:32,830
Then... I don't think I'll give you any more trouble here.

267
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:37,640
- Engineer Li, this...
- What's going on?

268
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,260
Xiao Yun, wait!

269
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,220
Hi.

270
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,540
It was your first time sitting in the first class. Was the older sister sitting next to you your boss?

271
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,980
You're mistaken! She's my client.

272
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,580
I caused you some trouble.

273
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,170
It's nothing! It's our duty.

274
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:20,770
Oh right! I forgot that...

275
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:22,590
I don't want to add your WeChat.

276
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,880
- Without WeChat, how can I treat you to a meal later?
- I don't want to have a meal with you, either.

277
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,150
How about I sing a song from Lee Zhong Sheng?
 (famous Taiwanese songwriter and singer)

278
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:31,530
Sir, why don't you add me?

279
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,380
Sorry! I don't know you well.

280
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,510
You and I don't know each other well, either.

281
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,420
Add him, so we can't get out of here.

282
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,570
Just block him later.

283
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:47,380
I'm really not used to adding someone I don't know to WeChat.

284
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,550
- Then—
- How about this? I'll give you my phone number.

285
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,510

286

00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,400
Sister Yun, what's wrong?

292
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,880
Don't cry!

293
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,520
Calm down! Don't cry! Don't cry!

294
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,720
- What's wrong?
- I went to see Engineer Li even though I'm pregnant.

295
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,630
He thought that it was hard for me to still have to run around for projects while pregnant,

296
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,750
so he was very polite to me.

297
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:14,280
Who would've known that one of our own would come and stole the project from me!

298
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,660
Sister Yun, make it clear!

299
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,060
- What do you mean "stole the project?"
- How wasn't it?

300
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,780
You took advantage of the opportunity when I had gone into the bathroom.

301
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,560
We made an appointment with Engineer Li in advance.

302
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:27,040
- What do you mean we took advantage?
- That's right! We each have our own means of securing the project.

303
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,130
Are you the only one allowed to have the client feel pity for you?

304
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:32,480
I can't believe Director Wei.

305
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,120
Party A will think that our company is a joke.

306
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,850
In addition, Sister Yun is pregnant.

307

It's far more than just a joke!

308
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,950
Engineer Li said for us to solve our internal problems before chatting with them.

309
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,710
Look what they did!

310
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:49,320
Don't cry! Don't cry!

311
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,140
Stop crying.

312
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:58,720

00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,980
Goddess, what does this mean?

322
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:13,650
It means it's a blessing for you to be with her.

323
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:16,850
Goddess, isn't it a blessing for her

324
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:19,090

00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,440
You win; I lose.

347
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,040
You actually came.

348
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,990
Come in, please!

349
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,590
Didn't you tell me to come?

350
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,160
Come inside please, Honored Guest!

351
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,560
Come! This is your first time at my place, isn't it?

352
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,370
Treat this as your own home; no need to be courteous.

353
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:54,520
First floor, second floor, and there's also a third floor up on top.

354
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,800
Don't hold back!

355
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:07,870
I actually have a favor to ask you.

356
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:09,720
What is it?

357
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,120
Can I give your WeChat to my mom?

358
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:24,430
She calls me eight hundred times a day wanting to come here just for you.

359
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:28,200
I can't take it anymore. I'm begging you!

360
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,500
Beg then!

361
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,860
Bei Yao Yao, you're my savior.

362
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,460
- Only you can save me.
- Go ahead!

363
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,860
Really?

364
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,900
Xiao Yao.
(TN: Xiao means young, little, or just for endearing.)

365
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:50,390
You're a good friend.

366
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,900
[Mother]

367
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,200
[Friends Permission]

368
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,150
[Bei Yao Yao]

369
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:59,710
I sent it over.
[Confirm]

370
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,820
I got it.
[Xiao Juan]

371

[Add to Contacts]

372
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:15,690
Yao Yao, can you video chat her right now?

373
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:23,190
I'm already this age and I've never kowtowed to others before.

374
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,820
Yao Yao.

375
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,800
Fine!

376
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,880
Hello, Auntie!

377
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,580
Hello! Hello!

378
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:52,980
We meet again so soon.

379
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,750
Well, who are you?
(TN: She meant to ask for the exact spelling of the name.)

380
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:58,040
I can't figure out your name.

381
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,310
Which Bei and which Yao are they?

382
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,360
Auntie, it's the Bei in baby,

383
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,100
and two X's make up the character Yao.

384
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,800
Two what? Two X's?

385
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,840
This name... Are they two X's on top of each other

386
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,890
or next to each other?

387
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:18,720
On top of each other, Auntie.

388
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,370
On top of each other? That is...

389
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:27,280
Chacha, I have something to ask you.
(TN: X is Cha in Chinese)

390
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,890
Can you tell me your eight characters of birth?
(TN: Used to determine if two people are a good match.)

391
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,350
Mom, let's not talk about that! I'm hanging up now.

392
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,620
- You've chatted enough.
- I'm not done yet.

393
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,160
We have no time to waste.

394
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,850
Do you want grandchildren or not? You want them, don't you?

395
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:45,020
All right, all right.

396
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:54,910
Thank you! I'll treat you to dinner when I'm free.

397
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:56,970
Are you satisfied?

398
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,660
Very!

399
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,100
Thank you.

400
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,240
Anyway, it's getting pretty late.

401
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:11,290
All right! I don't know Auntie very well, so I'll delete her from my WeChat.

402
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,760
Stop!

403
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:18,980
What did you say?

404
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:22,020
No. I think it's really inappropriate.

405
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,200
You see? I don't know Auntie very well.

406
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,710
We've never even seen each other in person.

407
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:29,350
Chacha? She calls me Bei Chacha.

408
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:32,790
Auntie doesn't even know my name. Let me delete her!

409
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,070
Fine!

410
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,780
You win.

411
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:45,960
Tell me your conditions!

412
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,600
Are you sure this is your home?

413
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,800
What else? Or is it your home then?

414
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,400
Is it rented or bought?

415
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,100
It's bought on mortgage.

416
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,200
How about this,

417
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,800
I'll give you a thousand a month, and you rent a room to me.

418
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,550
Are you joking?

419
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,400
We're an unrelated single man and woman.

420
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,230
- Why should I rent it to you?
- We're co-workers.

421
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,800
How nice it is!

422
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,000
This room then.

423
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,200
This is the room!

424
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,690
Bei Yao Yao, have I agreed?

425
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:38,600
Don't you know whose home this is?

426
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,600
Starting today, don't think of me as a woman!

427
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,400
I also won't think of you as a man.

428
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,200
-Bei— Bei—
- We're just co-workers and roommates.

429
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,600
- Okay?
- Bei Cha Cha, listen well!

430
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,900
Neither of us are drunk today, we're very sober.

431
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:53,200
If you continue to be this way, I won't deny your high passions.

432
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,970
Come! You take it off, too.

433
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:58,100
Come! Come! What are you doing?

434
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,360
Take it off! Take it off!

435
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,200
What are you doing?

436
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,800
Open! Open the door!

437
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:17,400
Cui Long, I won't delete your mom's WeChat then.

438
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,600
If she contacts me again,

439
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,400
I'll just say we're living together.

440
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,900
Isn't this letting a wolf come inside?

441
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,200
Is there anything to drink in your home?

442
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,400
Why doesn't this room have a shower or bath?

443
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,900
We don't wash ourselves in the old Cui family.

444
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,900
Director Zhou!

445
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,800
You're back?

446
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,600
Did you really handle this matter within two hours?

447
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,300
- It didn't work at first.
- Two coffees.

448
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:04,000
She didn't give me a chance, but I did it following your methods.

449
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,500
So she accepted the materials just like that.

450
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,000
And then?

451
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,800
She... clearly told me that you're trying to harm me.

452
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,420
"I'm harming you."

453
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,700
What did I teach you?

454
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:21,400
Doing sales and chasing romance follow the same rule, "The client is the girlfriend."

455
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,500
Then did you pursue Director Zhao like a girlfriend?

456
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,400
Of course, not.

457
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,000
- No?
- No!

458
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Really?

459
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,500
However, I want to pursue a flight attendant on that plane.

460
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,400
- Pretty?
- Not pretty.

461
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,500
Not pretty? Then, good physique?

462
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,200
Not good.

463
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,600
That suites your taste then.

464
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,100
Your coffee.

465
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,800
Excellent! Once you pursue a flight attendant,

466
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,200
then you can take care of your own roundtrip tickets.

467
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,400
You pay for the coffee first, then I'll transfer the amount to you later.

468
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,400
How much is it?

469
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,800
Twenty five in total.

470
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,700
- Coffee, please.
- Okay.

471
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,200
- Director Luo.
- Hi.

472
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,700
I'm really sorry that I'm late.

473
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,000
Not at all. Not at all! I just arrived, too.

474
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,600
- Have a seat!
- You sit, too.

475
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,400
I ordered orange juice for you. Is that okay?

476
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,800
Yes.

477
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,800
Director Luo,

478
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,000
I'm really have to thank you over this matter.

479
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,300
Why do you say that?

480
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,900
Here! Try the cold appetizer.

481
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,600
- It's the house specialty.
- Okay.

482
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,200
If I can help you, it's my honor.

483
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,900
You really solved a big problem for me.

484
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:06,900
I've gone to that school many times already, and they never would agree no matter what I said.

485
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,800
How did you convince them?

486
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:14,100
I happen to have a friend who can say something to the school.

487
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:17,000
Their class competitiveness is really fierce now.

488
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
However, don't you worry! I've arranged everything for your child.

489
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,100
There's no problem in getting into the advanced classes.

490
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:25,180
Director Luo,

491
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:28,380
you're really capable.

492
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,210
Not just in the IT field,

493
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:33,800
you even have friends in all other fields, too.

494
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,600
Don't you keep calling me Director Luo anymore, either!

495
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:43,400
If you want to be friends, just call me Xiao Luo from now on.

496
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,600
Sure! It's Xiao Luo then.

497
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,200
I definitely want to be friends with you.

498
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,600
However, I have a strange habit.

499
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,400
Work and personal matters are separate.

500
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,200
Now that we're friends, if it's a personal matter,

501
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,100
we can chat however we want.

502
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,200
Okay. I'll follow you.

503
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,900
Have some more! This tastes really good.

504
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,790
Waiter!

505
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,200
Come! You can bring the entrees.

506
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,000
Okay. Thanks.

507
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,000
Congratulations!

508
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,200
Thanks.

509
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,300
Hi, Xiao Yun! What's the matter?

510
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:06,200
Director Zhou, it's bad news!

511
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,600
O&T suddenly changed the judge.

512
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,590
Engineer Li whom I had been following has suddenly been replaced.

513
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:11,600
What do we do?

514
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,600
What to do? What can I do?

515
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,600
- What's the matter?
- Nothing, nothing! I dropped something.

516
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,400
It's fine. Wait a moment!

517
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,000
- What's going on?
- Grandma, it's fine.

518
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,800
I'll take care of it myself. I'll take care of it.

519
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,600
It's fine! Something fell down just now.

520
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,100
Who replaced him?

521
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,000
Huikang's Engineer Liu.

522
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,800
Engineer Liu?

523
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,700
He came to our company during the O&T testing last time.

524
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,000
I got it.

525
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,580
Hello, Director Zhou!

526
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:12,500
You must make sure that our bidding document is safe.

527
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:16,000
I'm guarding it. Tomorrow, I'll escort the car to the resort village.

528
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,300
Ever since you were a kid, as soon as you interfere, something will be missing from here or there.

529
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,300
- Wait a moment!
- What a mess!

530
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,800
Grandma.

531
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,700
Director Zhou. Director Zhou?

532
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,800
I'm here. I'm here!

533
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,600
Can you hear me, Director Zhou?

534
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,600
I was talking to Grandma.

535
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,800
One of the stakes that we planted

536
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,600
has been pulled by Huikang.

537
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,540
Hence, we have only one method now,

538
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,500
change the bid!

539
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:54,260
Change the bid?

540
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,690
Fang Wei, listen!

541
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:02,400
Immediately change the quotes on the bid.

542
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,470
I want to...

543
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:11,000
lower it another ten million.

544
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,000
Ten million?

545
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,210
I... Everyone is off now.

546
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:18,800
Isn't it against the rules to suddenly change the quotes?

547
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,800
Rules? What rules?

548
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,000
If we followed the rules, you rascal wouldn't have been able to enter the sales department!

549
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,800
Let me tell you! Right away, immediately change it.

550
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,400
Grandma.

551
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,400
- What are you doing?
- Aren't you going on a business trip?

552
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,980
I... I... I'm going to wash it for you.

553
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,200
Back then when your father went on a business trip, I'd also wash it all for him.

554
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,230
Grandma, I'm leaving tomorrow.

555
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:48,600
I still need to stay here tonight.

556
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,900
You... aren't you leaving?

557
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,800
Then you take care of it yourself.

558
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:08,500
Fang Wei, you have to change it.

559
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,300
I said, you have to change it!

560
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,100
Be quick!

561
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,700
Okay.

562
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,300
Change it then.

❝ One Half ❞ by Mo Fei Ding Lu

564
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:55,300
♫  The sun has only shone halfway  ♫

565
00:41:55,300 --> 00:42:01,020
♫  The freckles on my face are bright and dark  ♫

566
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,970
♫  Oh...  ♫

567
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:09,400
♫  Who sung the song halfway through  ♫

568
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:15,200
♫  Leaving behind the roars of the chorus in an empty room  ♫

569
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,400
♫  I...  ♫

570
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:25,000
♫  Slowly tidied up the embarrassment of the dispersing crowd  ♫

571
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:33,200
♫  Who would abruptly break off the lingering care of the past?  ♫

572
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,800
♫  You deserved it, someone said  ♫

573
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:47,200
♫  It would be for the best that the story stays unfinished  ♫

574
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:53,900
♫  Those words were spoken halfway  ♫

575
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:57,800
♫  When those few words reached the tip of the tongue  ♫

576
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,400
♫  It would take several years to accept  ♫

577
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:08,000
♫  Whose heart is closed midway from now on  ♫

578
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:15,400
♫  Locking up all the endless insomnia in the past?  ♫

579
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:22,100
♫  Some words are only spoken halfway  ♫

580
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:26,000
♫  To adjust the emotional intensity afterwards  ♫

581
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,600
♫  Just air-dry it slowly with time  ♫

582
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:36,200
♫  Whose heart will miss a half from now on  ♫

583
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,200
♫  Just let it totally submerge  ♫

584
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:43,900
♫  My remaining dimness  ♫

585
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:51,000
♫  The other half  ♫

586
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:56,800
♫  The other half  ♫

587
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:04,610
♫  The other half  ♫
