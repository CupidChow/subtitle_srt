Before negotiating the price on this O&T project, I want an accurate

Director Luo, let me put it this way.

37
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:53,680
If someone who does long-distance runs all the time, he runs a distance of five miles consistently.

38
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,910
Suddenly, at the same pace, he runs six miles, his heart and lungs should still be able to endure it.

So one hundred sixty-five million should be Huikang's final offer.

Which means that we'll be chosen as long as we have a lower offer, doesn't it?

171
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,100
Keep the profit! It can't be any lower than this.

172
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,550
I've always been curious.

173
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,250
I heard that you've never lost a battle in the East China Region.

174
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,900
Is that true?

175
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,600
Of course, I have! If I've never lost, how do I win?

176
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,200
What's your opinion on winning and losing?

177
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,000
Depends on what you're fighting for.

178
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,800
Are you fighting for the clients or fighting the enemy?

179
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,600
So are you fighting for Du Heng or fighting Luo Jia?

180
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,600
I'm not sure yet.

181
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,300
Tonight at nine. My treat!

182
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,100
Busy.

183
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,200
You pick the place then.

184
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,540
No!

185
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,100
Give me a chance to apologize.

186
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,100
We'll see!

187
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,000
Meeting someone here?

188
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,200
How could you tell?

189
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,500
Eyes are the traitors to the soul.

190
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,540
♫  Oh, oh, the storyline is pretty good  ♫

191
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,700
♫  I am a bad boy

192
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,800
♫  I am a bad boy  ♫

193
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,000
♫  I am a bad boy  ♫

194
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,900
♫  Ah, ah, waiting with patience  ♫

195
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,200
♫  I am a bad boy  ♫

196
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,350
♫  Oh, oh, the helplessness of a stranded beast  ♫

197
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,200
♫  I am a bad boy  ♫

198
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,700
I locked you in a storage room.

199
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,250
It was my fault.

200
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,200
I'm making it up to you now.

201
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,500
I've written my final offer...

202
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,800
My final offer right now is in my palms.

203
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,400
We, as sales people, are gamblers.

204
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,700
Let's gamble! Left or right?

205
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,700
I never gamble.

206
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,600
Why would I gamble on things that I'm sure of?

207
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
I'm not joking with you.

208
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,600
If you don't pick one, you'll just miss your opportunity.

209
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,200
Five, four...

210
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,400
Your way of apologizing is very unusual.

211
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,000
Three...

212
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,300
Your gambling problem is pretty serious, isn't it?

213
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,900
Two...

214
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,800
I'm not picking.

215
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,400
One.

216
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,200
Look! I'm this kind of person that

217
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,000
when I asked you out,

218
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,090
I truly want to apologize to you.

219
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:19,900
For real!

220
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,650
It must be exhausting to redo the bidding document.

221
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:28,200
How did you find the time to ask me out?

222
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,900
How do you know that I'm redoing the bidding document?

223
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,500
If you're not redoing it, why did you burn it then?

224
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm off.

225
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,200
Take my advice! Competing with low prices...

226
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,100
Is bad for the industry!

227
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,000
Ten points for you.

228
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,400
Get me another one!

229
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,000
Another one. Thanks!

230
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,530
I really underestimated your senselessness.

231
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,300
Director Luo.

232
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:40,200
If you need Zhou Rui's bidding price, I can get it for you.

233
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,800
I don't need it.

234
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:56,000
Zhou Rui had mercy on you and didn't go after you.

235
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,800
Compared to him, you're really lacking.

236
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,800
I also have... my own reasons.

237
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,300
Reasons?

238
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,700
It seems to me that over-promising

239
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,600
is still way worse than competing with low prices.

240
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,800
You made it your habit, haven't you?

241
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,800
Do something else! It's nearly impossible for you to keep making a living in sales.

242
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,000
Zhou Rui will never... will never make any offer that leaves no profit for his company.

243
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
As long as you have a price lower than his, he'll definitely give up.

244
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I'll get Jieke's final offer before the bidding.

245
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,820
- You messed it up so quickly.
- Sister.

246
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,500
Have a seat!

247
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,120
It's worse than messing it up.

248
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,200
She didn't want to talk in the first place.

249
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,000
Luo Jia is the most unusual sales rep I've ever seen.

250
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,200
How unusual?

251
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,400
I'm worried that you'll lose badly.

252
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,600
Good question!

253
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,700
I'm talking about love.

254
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,900
Love?

255
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,200
None of us, sales people, are normal.

256
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,000
Sales people like her and I

257
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,600
only talk business, not love.

258
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,400
- Director Zhou.
- Could you do me a favor?

259
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,000
Go ahead! I can do a hundred favors for you.

260
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,200
Help me keep an eye on Luo Jia these days from a safe distance.

261
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,000
Go to see whom she's meeting with and photograph it. Can you do it?

262
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,100
Director Zhou, what do you mean?

263
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,200
- Is it difficult?
- It isn't difficult.

264
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,600
It's quite thrilling actually.

265
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,800
Send the pictures to me as soon as you take them.

266
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,800
Like a spy movie?

267
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,900
Only you and I know about this.

268
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,600
Understood.

269
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,400
Let me teach you something.

270
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,600
One of the most important skills of a salesperson is stalking.

271
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,800
Got it!

272
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,770
[Guohuo Bridge]

273
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:05,630
- Director Qian.
- Director Luo from Huikang, we meet again.

274
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,390
Yes. We meet again.

275
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:11,690
I wanted to meet with you because I want to confirm the efficiency of sorting the warehouse receipts.

276
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,060
Sure.

277
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:16,240
- Wait for me in the car.
- All right.

278
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,790
Are you on your way out soon?

279
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,600
I'll have a meeting later.

280
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,310
All right. I'll email the information to your cellphone first, please find time to read it.

281
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,110
I'll provide the detailed presentation after your meeting.

282
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,100
- Sure.
- Okay, I'll let you get back to your work.

283
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,540
- See you later, Director Luo.
- See you!

284
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,430
How childish!

285
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,320
Hello, Director Zhou.

286
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:10,390
President Chen.

287
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,120
Master.

288
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,390
Do you know this person?

289
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:18,590
Director Qian from the bidding evaluation committee.

290
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,360
What's his position there?

291
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,030
He has a technical background as well

292
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,360
and also the authority to speak.

293
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:28,940
Do you want to take him down?

294
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:32,970
Right now... It's too late to take anyone down.

295
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:37,760
However, let me give you the report! If Huikang's technical score exceeds 80 points for this,

296
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,920
I'm worried that it eventually have to be the lowest price.

297
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:46,230
Lead and do your best in times of crisis.

298
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:49,260
By the way, Wei Yan is back.

299
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,990
Haven't you two met?

300
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,120
I'll make an appointment after the conclusion of O&T's bidding.

301
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:56,760
Fang Wei!

302
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,150
No one found out that I went out, right?

303
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,780
Why is it never flowers every time?

304
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,590
Next time.

305
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:08,710
Come here. Come here. Come here.

306
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,490
I want this one.

307
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,950
What's going on?

308
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:20,180
When did our Administration Department start giving out benefits?

309
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,640
Administration Department?

310
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,180
The toilet rolls that your Administration Department issued last year,

311
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,100
I still haven't finished using.

312
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,560
I'm still starving.

313
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,770
What's there to wipe by giving us that many toilet rolls?

314
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:36,950
Is that so?

315
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:39,630
Then does this mean your Sales Department opened up the vaults?

316
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:43,210
Director Wei is back with gifts for everyone.

317
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:49,090
[Jieke Company]
This is for you.

318
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,310
Come in!

319
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,980
Director Zhou.

320
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,130
What's up?

321
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,520
Director Wei came back early.

322
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,600
I just came to tell you.

323
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:15,280
Why are you telling me this?

324
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,290
I thought you'd want to know.

325
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:22,000
You thought so?

326
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,040
Based on what?

327
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:31,060
I'm leaving then, Director Zhou.

328
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:49,330
- Director Wei.
- It's such a hot day, why are you drinking some kind of black tea?

329
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:52,640
Alright. I'll replace this with green tea.

330
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:57,260
It's still appropriate to retain you.

331
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,610
What I want are outstanding achievements.

332
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:03,170
Just like this Pixiu, it can only enter but not leave.
(TN: Pixiu - Chinese mythical beast used in geomancy)

333
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,360
I can transfer the O&T project to Zhou Rui.

334
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,340
Since you've moved him to Beiing,

335
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,560
I can unload my burdens to him at any time.

336
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,980
Let's talk about this again after O&T.

337
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:18,920
Director Wei, I heard you're back in Bejing to re-org the teams.

338
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,890
Then... Then, I...

339
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:24,840
You're from the Beijing region and still responsible for Beijing.

340
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,610
There won't be any changes for you, will there?

341
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,180
This isn't for you to worry about.

342
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:45,030
What's the progress on the O&T project?

343
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:49,280
Currently, it seems like Zhou Rui has revived this project.

344
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,040
However, the original plan has been subverted.

345
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:56,480
Go to the Sales Department and say hi to them.

346
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,040
Zhou Rui is here.

347
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,180
They're all facing problems with choosing sides.

348
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,290
Whether to follow the person or the project,

349
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:05,890
they're very clear about this.

350
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:11,320
- This—
- Besides, O&T isn't the only project you have.

351
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,410
- How's Fast's payment coming along?
- Fast?

352
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:17,450
Regarding this Fast project, I...

353
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:24,420
If you can't get it done, quickly get legal affairs to handle the contract immediately.

354
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,920
Don't wait until the chickens have flown the coop and come out empty-handed.

355
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,750
I want to wait for awhile longer

356
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,770
because these two companies are both in logistics.

357
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:33,490
One is a city and the other is a village.

358
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:37,390
Actually, the projects of these two companies can complement each other.

359
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:43,030
We're doing business transactions, not charity.

360
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,740
I understand.

361
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,600
I caught half of a movie on my flight back.

362
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:07,120
It had a phrase that the meaning seemed to be,

363
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:14,330
"Whoever feeds you, he's your boss".

00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:18,700

365
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,200

368
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:02,020
I lied! I'll be there.

369
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,350
Director Qian, did you read the content of the email?

370
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,380
Yes, I did.

371
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,260
I know that, in the eyes of technical specialists,

372
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:13,880
our sorting of warehouse receipts isn't an obvious advantage.

373
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,120
However, I still want to contend for your critical vote.

374
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,700

376
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:25,170
However, you should know how General Tian Ji won the horse race.

377
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:30,480
Can I take this based on my understanding then, Director Qian?

378
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,290
Huikiang doesn't need to compete with our competitors on the same track.

379
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:37,410
Is that correct?

380
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:42,410
Based on industry rules, I can't make any comments.

00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:42,850

You first burned the proposal and then had your five minute speech.

402
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:11,620

He doesn't know we're meeting.

00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,720
I understand now.

412
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,880
You're trying to bribe me, get me to back out.

413
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,920
- It means you have a guilty conscience.
- Bribe you?

414
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,600
That sounds so horrible.

415
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:01,680

416
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:05,780

418
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,720
- Where are you?
- I just got to the hotel.

419
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,370
We need to revise the bid.

00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:43,240
The bidding starts tomorrow morning; do we have enough time?

421
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,660
We must because Luo Jia has met Wang Yi Nan.

422
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:48,140
- What did he say?
- I don't know.

423

Regardless, they've met. Wang Yinan has been with me for so long.

He knows my bidding strategy.

425
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,830
- What do you need me to do?
- Base on the existing quotes,

426
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:58,440
make two copies and then create two more quotes.

427
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,910
- Quote higher or lower?
- Lower.

428
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:02,820
Make it lower by half a million.

429
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,840
That's one hundred sixty five million.

430

Is that the profit sacrifice you were talking about?

431
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:09,970
We must guarantee fifteen percent profit and that's my bottom line.

Everyone, Jieke and Huikang's bottom lines

456
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,460
are the same.

457
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:36,850
Everyone, please give your thoughts.

458
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:39,900
Huikang company is a leading hardware manufacturer.

459
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:44,500
They have a high market share so their cost is well controlled.

460
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,220
As for Jieke, only their R&D costs are high

461
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:50,440
which is why they can set a low bid price like Huikang's.

462
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,920
It'll definitely reduce operation and maintenance in the future.

463
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,960
Therefore, personally, I prefer Huikang.

464
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,730
Both companies are different.

465
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:04,080
Huikang wants to manufacture faster.

466
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,160
So they depend on CPU processing power for speed.

467
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,500
But Jieke seeks stability.

468
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:14,850
Their advantage is in their design and software.

469
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:19,440
Huikang's advantage is that they can quickly meet the market demands.

470
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,150
So that everyone is able to see and buy it,

471
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,680
but they may not be able

472
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:28,080
to continue this trend in the future.

473
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:33,920
If both items have about the same technical specifications,

474
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,830
then the price is the deciding factor.

475
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:40,480
The safety of the product should be the deciding factor.

then you'll probably be extremely ashamed, won't you?

483
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:12,090
Have you always been so confident?

484
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:14,370
