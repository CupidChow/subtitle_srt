- Hi, Sister Jia.

23
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,250
Why did you vanish?

24
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,760
Stop nagging! What's the matter? Say it!

25
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,480
Didn't Wang Yi Nan ask to gather the entire sales team this afternoon for a meeting?

00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,340
Have you forgotten?

Tell him I have an urgent meeting with a client.

00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,230
So do we need to wait for you?

30
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,690
Don't wait! Just start without me.

31
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,980
Boss, why are you here?

32
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,860
I saw the resignation letter.

33
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,800
I wanted to tell you when I got to the airport.

34
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,950
You want to leave without saying goodbye?

00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,120

I'll send you to the airport as I want to talk to you about something on the way there.

Hello everyone!

00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,460
I might have known a few of you before.

54
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,790
Some of you I just met. How about this!

55
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:41,230
Let me introduce myself! My name is Wang Yi Nan.

56
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,630
Thanks to President Lin's kindness, we can all become colleagues.

57
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,580
I'll need a lot of assistance from you all in the future.

58
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,840
Why don't we all introduce ourselves?

Hello. Hello! My name is Gao Fei.

60

I just joined the sales team.

74
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,470
I mainly take care Director Luo's administrative tasks.

75
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:28,130
Please take care of me.

76
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,130
Where did you get this from?

77
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,860
That's a gift from Director Luo.

78
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,620
Where did you work before here?

79
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,930
I worked in a mall.

80
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,570
A mall? In operations?

81
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:43,900
No. I was a shop assistant, selling shoes.

82
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,380
Selling shoes?

83
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,550
Director Luo's ways of picking her staff is truly unexpected.

84
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,840
What surprises you?

85
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,290
Director Luo, you're back.

86
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,490
We're just chit-chatting, waiting for you.

87
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,860
- How about this! Let me go through the work list with you?
- No need.

88
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,000
I heard you said "Thanks to President Lin's kindness," didn't you?

89
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,570
If that's the case, from now on you can simply report to President Lin.

90
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:41,050
I've said everything I wanted to say.

91
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,460
When you get back, you'll have to suffer a bit.

92
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,240
I'm not going to lie,

93
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,990
the moment I withheld those transactions, I knew this would be the consequence.

94
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,840
As for you,

95
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,700
have you thought about what you're going to do next?

96
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,470
It's easy on my end.

97
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:05,730
It's easy in Beijing, but it's harder for you in Hangzhou.

98
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,900
You always make things sound so simple.

99
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,490
When first came to Beijing, I was fighting with my head first.

100
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,290
And now, I'm landing directly.

101
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,270
It's much easier that way, isn't it?

102
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,570
Go on.

103
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,740
Let's gossip for a bit! Why was Luo Jia there earlier?

104
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,680
If you don't leave, your flight will leave without you.

105
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,630
Hurry on!

106
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:33,970
If you don't say anything, I'll come to my own conclusions then.

What did you see through the peephole?

110
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,700
Why aren't you openining the door?

111

Are you mad at me?

112
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:26,380
The tailoring of the suit is spectacular.

113
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,750
In order to show my appreciation,

114
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,670
I brought you a gift.

115
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,120
I... Then... Then I'll leave it at your door.

116

Don't forget to pick it up!

117
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,530
The doctor has told me that this medicine has hormones.

118
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,580
You shouldn't use too much of it.

119
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,670
That's true.

120
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:48,220
I don't even have a chance to get jealous in this relationship.

121
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,250
It only means I have poor judgment.

122

- Where?

Four, five.

137
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,330
Director Zhou is really an inexplicable person.

138
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,910
Yang Lu resigned.

139
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,790
He didn't even say a word to keep her.

140
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,250
He really didn't keep Yang Lu?

141
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,530
They don't keep the useful people, but all the useless people are kept.

142
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:29,000
You actually understand yourself.

143
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,050
You know you're useless.

144
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:33,150
Did I talk to you?

145
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,570
I think Director Zhou sees things in black and white.

146
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:39,190
After all, it's a big deal to hold the orders.

Huge gossip!

Come, come! Give me something to drink. Quick. Huge gossip!

The clients whose orders were held up by Yang Lu

150
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,050
have all been intercepted by Huikang.

151
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,910
Also,

152
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,230
the talk is that Yang Lu did it deliberately.

153
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,830
Impossible.

154
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,910
- The company has been good to her, unless...
- No way!

155
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,530
Unless what? Say it!

156
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,520
Guess again!

157
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,360
Who's the person that intercepted them?

158
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,890
- Who?
- Who?

159
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,640
Say it! Who? Who?

160
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,530
- Quickly say it!
- Wang Yi Nan.

161
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,750
Who?

162
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,510
Wang?

163
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,930
It turns out to be Wang Yi Nan who was originally part of East China.

164
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,490
Now, he has gone to Huikang.

165
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:31,330
- Wang Yi Nan?
- Director Zhou's enemy.

166
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,020
Isn't this clear now?

167
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,300
Director Zhou played a big chess game.

168
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,830
My guess is that he wins both ways.

169
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:42,350
Why doesn't Director Zhou just go directly to Huikang? Why does he spend so much effort?

170
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,530
Have a little imagination, okay?

171
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,700
Would you even get it, if I said it?

172
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,110
I really can't talk with you.

173
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,380
Director Cai's information.

174
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,330
Do you think this is also a pitfall?

175
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:03,820
Huikang is doing it step by step.

176
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,500
It's trying to collapse Jieke from within.

177
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,490
- You've brought a wolf into the room!
- Whether it's a wolf or a dog, it's both good.

178
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,060
I've chatted with you several times privately.

179
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,530
It's normal to talk however many times about acquisitions.

180
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:14,860
Didn't I talk about it from the angle of the company's benefits?

181
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,440
- Isn't that right?
- In the last Board of Directors' meeting,

182
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,570
we talked about turning loss to profit within three quarters, how many months has it been?

183
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:22,800
If the acquisition is progressing normally, it should've gotten to the point it's at now.

184
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,640
Is that right?

185
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,910
Hello, President Lin. This way, please.

186
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,650
The meeting room is over there.

187
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,050
[Jieke Company]

188
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:39,810
Luo... Luo... Luo...

189
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,210
Luo-Luo-Luo-Luo, what Luo?

190
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:45,210
- What's wrong?
- Luo Jia is here.

191
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:48,280
[Jieke Company]

192
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,360
[Jieke Company]

193
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,820
What the heck!

194
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,660
The cleaning people are good. No dust!

195
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,980
Once the acquisition is completed, the administration department can stay.

196
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,100
Everyone, today, I've brought the heads of several core departments,

197
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,050
such as the sales department, finance department, and legal department,

198
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,710
to come and get to know the place.

199
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:16,960
We'll be one family from now on.

200
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,490
President Chen, I'll get straight to the point then.

201
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,720
The same old topic, cooperation.

202
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,320
Cooperation is winning together.

203
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:34,940
We've seen each other a few times already.

204
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,040
Why don't you have anything new to say?

205
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:43,230
Today, Luo Jia will direct the meeting.

206
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:46,520
- Okay, Chairman Li?
- Sure. I'm all ears.

207
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,260
Come!

208
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,860
Sit!

209
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,560
Jieke's East China market is basically gone.

210
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:17,460
East China isn't safe, and North China is also under pressure by us.

211
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,310
It's about to lose everything.

212
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,190
Of course, you'll say you still have Northeast China,

213
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,200
Southwest China, and Northwest China.

214
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,330
But compared to Huikang's overall market,

215
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:28,540
you've already fallen far, far behind.

216
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:33,270
So according to what you said,

217
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,330
Huikang is the dominant force that can sink us?

218
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,640
It can be said to be invincible then.

219
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,080
Then, why are you here today acting all serious to talk with us?

220
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,580
Why don't you just follow your plan?

221
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,810
I have a clear understanding of Jieke's financial situation.

222
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,600
Three months.

223
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,820
In the next three months, I plan to

224
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,880
grab every one of your orders.

225
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,790
No matter how much you offer in price, mine will be lower than yours by 10 percent.

226
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,380
By then, I think

227
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:10,320
you'll be the ones to beg us to talk about an acquisition, won't you?

228
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,150
If we're two companies,

229
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,430
we can collaborate and serve customers together.

230
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,180
There will still be opportunities like this.

231
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:36,260
Right now, a company that's sales oriented

232
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:40,260
acquires our company that has technology in our soul.

233
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,450
This will only let the market squeeze and deform the technology.

234
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,600
Let's not mention any technological innovations first.

235
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,550
Just think about, regarding advancing this industry,

236
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:52,260
it would be so tragic.

237
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,450
- Director Luo.
- Zhou Rui, can't you go too far out?

238
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,900
Don't you understand, in this field, there's only life and death?

239
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:02,030
Our two companies used to have an excellent collaboration.

240
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,830
O&T's case was the perfect example

241
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,170
of your sales and our technology.

242
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:10,030
- Shouldn't we put that on the table?
- So what?

243
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:13,520
So what? It's all in the past!

244
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:19,140
Zhou Rui, you can't save Jieke.

245
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,740
You can admit it if you want to; you still have to admit it even if you don't want to.

246
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,110
You've already lost.

247
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:34,870
[Chairman Lin Zhen Wei]

248
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:05,710
What you just said was especially sincere.

249
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:10,190
But, Zhou Rui in the South, Jieke has lost.

250
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,500
I ordered Mutton Braised Noodles for you.

251
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,650
Get some raw garlic!

252
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,550
- May I use these garlic?
- Okay. Go ahead.
- Thanks.

253
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,140
The vinegar tastes wrong.

254
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,710
Can I use this vinegar?

255
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,210
Now, it's right.

256
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:58,420
It looks like you're more anxious than they are.

257
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,750
Our plan is progressing slowly; of course, I'm anxious.

258
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,760
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Your noodles.

259
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,180
- Thanks.
- Enjoy.

260
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,230
After discussing things all morning,

261
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:11,260
I'm really hungry.

262
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,870
Say! That President Chen of yours.

263
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,840
He's still trying to keep it up.

264
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,870
So stubborn.

265
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,810
What's our next steps then?

266
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,600
That Yang Lu of yours... is really a pain.

267
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,000
Yes.

268
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,700
Say! Why are so many tough ones coming out of your Jieke?

269
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,830
Except you!

270
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,600
You're the only one who sees things clearly.

271
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:08,400
President Lin, Yang Lu's leaving is a good thing actually.

272
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,200
I'll put my people in her position.

273
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,000
That way, we'll take East China for ourselves.

274
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:38,700
I can only eat like this in front of you.

275
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,400
When I go back, I still have to pretend

276
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,800
to be careful about my carb intake.

277
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,700
It's really tough being an Internet celebrity.

278
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,300
President Lin!

279
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,800
I've found another good noodle place.

280
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,300
- Where?
- I'll take you there next time.

281
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,600
All right.

282
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,700
Director Liu.

283
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,600
What are you...

284
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,100
You clearly knew I was coming here,

285
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,900
yet you still dressed like this?

286
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,400
I thought... I thought you asked me to the lakeside for a meeting.

287
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,400
So I purposely dressed more formal.

288
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,400
- I didn't think—
- I don't have time to hear this.

289
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,900
I only have half an hour for jogging.

290
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,600
If you can't jog, never mind then.

291
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,800
Director Liu, I'll run with you.

292
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,600
You accompany me to run?

293
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,600
With those? Are you sure?

294
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,600
I'm s-sure.

295
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,200
Take these!

296
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,800
Director Liu.

297
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,500
Let's go!

298
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,800
Director Liu, the stability of Jieke's servers...

299
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
as well as our range of customer services are both top-notch.

300
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,650
Director Liu, based on... based on the situation of your company,

301
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:55,100
we've prepared a complete set of...

302
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,600
Director Liu!

303
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,000
You're pretty good.

304
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,600
Director Liu.

305
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,000
Our Jieke's servers..

306
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,400
are the best value of them all.

307
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,790
There's no good or bad with servers;

308
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:45,600
however, I quite like your attitude.

309
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,800
You're persistent, and even harsh to yourself, too.

310
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,200
Come karaoke with me tonight!

311
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,100
- The shoes?
- Keep them!

312
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,500
Waiter, get me the check for three zero two.

313
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,200
All right.

314
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,200
Reception, get the check for three zero two.

315
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,800
Reception, get the check for three zero two!

316
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,400
The check for three zero two is 13,600 yuan.

317
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,600
Please repeat!

318
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,800
13,600 yuan!

319
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,200
How much?

320
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,200
You spent thirteen thousand and six hundred.

321
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,500
How would you like to pay?

322
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,800
All right. Enjoy your night!

323
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,600
Sir, do you want to consider getting an annual pass with us?

324
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,280
Because you spent a lot this time,

325
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,800
getting an annual pass will get you a major discount this time.

326
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,600
Fang Wei, did you get rich or go crazy?

327
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,800
I hit the jackpot today.

328
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,600
Did Director Liu agree to pay?

329
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:43,000
Not only did he agree to pay the rest of the payment, he also give me another lead.

330
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,100
Did your face or your cheap suit appeal to him?

331
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,820
He gave me a contract already.

332
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,500
It's up to you to believe it or not.

333
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,800
Yes!

334
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,000
Here, look! The contract.

335
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,900
- It's hard to say whether it's a blessing or a curse.
- Sister Yun, this is the spicy pot I ordered for you.

336
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:04,200
Take a look! Let me know if it isn't enough.

337
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,700
Fang Wei, I'm not eating.

338
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,600
I still have to go out later.

339
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,220
I appreciate the gesture though.

340
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,300
You're not eating?

341
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,330
So tacky!

342
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,200
Xie Yi, enough!

343
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,000
How long do you intend to keep doing this?

344
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,700
I've already apologized and explained, what more do you want from me?

345
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,400
I didn't want anything.

346
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:35,200
I just want to see how long can you keep being a hypocrite for.

347
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,800
You're bullying me? Fine!

348
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,000
You call me a hypocrite?

349
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,400
Xie Yi, aren't you a hypocrite?

350
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,040
You buy luxury bags, pretend to be a high-end office worker, and go back to your tiny apartment.

351
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:52,100
- Who are you being putting this on for?
- Xiao Yun, that has gone too far.

352
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,800
I'm spending my own money, whom am I hurting?

353
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,900
You hurt me!

354
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,700
Those deals you got signed,

355
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:02,600
without my help, could you have gotten them done?

356
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,400
Sister Yun.

357
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,800
She's the one to talk.

358
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,400
It's fine. Keep eating!

359
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,550
You guys eat.

360
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,800
- Why is every order falling into Huikang's hands?
- I...

361
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,400
Where did Lin Zhen Wei get his information?

362
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,600
I'll investigate it.

363
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,200
Are you only getting started?

364
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,500
The majority of the East China market has already been stolen.

365
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,400
So what if it's true?

366
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I'm the only one who wants to save the company.

367
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,300
Do you guys want me to become a laughing stock?

368
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,200
President Chen, can I deal with it my way this time?

369
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,600
- That Wang Yi Nan, when did he join Huikang?
- A while ago.

370
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,200
Look at the kind of people who worked for you!

371
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,800
They're either traitors or those who withheld contracts!

372
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,950
Also, that Luo Jia...

373
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,260
Don't ever go soft with her ever again!

374
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:17,200
[Jieke Company]

375
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,600
- Got the deal done?
- Yes!

376
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,000
I've got the contract already.

377
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,500
I also didn't think this could happen.

378
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,300
I got my first order so smoothly.

379
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,400
I not only got the payment of over nine million back,

380
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,200
but I also sold over two hundred devices.

381
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,600
I learned more about the company's asset situation

382
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,500
and looked up their offline distributors.

383
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:08,200
I made sure to understand the background of their investment company as well.

384
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,680
All of this, I learned from you.

385
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,000
- Really?
- Absolutely.

386
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,000
Okay. Leave this to me!

387
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,200
I have to look over it again.

388
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,800
- Do I need to sign it right now?
- No. No. No.

389
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,000
You can take your time.

390
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,960
Next, we'll have Liu Feng, Chairman Liu,

391
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,970
share with us the legacy and innovation of those who work with the internet.

392
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:57,290
Please welcome him!

393
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,680
What Mr. Liu just talked about was the structure.

394
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,140
Today, I'll be talking

395
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,680
about traditional and national culture.

396
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,390
It can be summed up in these words.

397
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:16,680
Life springs from suffering, and death is in happiness.

398
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,230
Throughout China's history,

399
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,720
those who will prosper if they remain vigilant in times of peace.

400
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,950
Otherwise, you'll take a decline, fail, and die.

401
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:28,320
The current surge of the internet wave

402
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,370
is something we didn't expect.

403
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:34,020
However, it's especially during these times,

404
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:36,040
that we've to be the most vigilant.

405
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,550
We've to be more vigilant in times of peace.

406
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,340
When a man swims against the tide,

407
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:47,000
they first have to make sure they don't get buried at the bottom of the sea.

408
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:52,920
How did it go?

409
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,210
Xie Yi.

410
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:04,090
Put together the information on Huikang's clients with contracts that are about to come to an end.

411
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:07,250
- The more detailed the better.
- What am I supposed to use to get that information?

412
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:09,790
It's called your brain.

413
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:11,560
Use it! Okay?

414
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,640
Ye Chao Dong.

415
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:17,030
Create an example case from our previous O&T project.

416
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:19,320
Make sure to highlight the key points.

417
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,610
- Yes?
- We'll have a meeting in an hour.

418
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:24,300
Have some people clear up the large conference room.

419
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,010
Okay.

420
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:29,230
Use your brain!

421
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:31,440
Shut up!

422
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,740
The beautiful lady over there.

423
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:44,800
Why does it seem like you don't agree with my take?

424
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,000
Are you talking about me?

425
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,820
Yes.

426
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:55,020
Actually, I agree with what you said on staying vigilant.

427
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:58,280
I just need some time to take it in.

428
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,140
I apologize I forgot to applaud just now.

429
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,270
I'll make it up to you now.

430
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,980
Look at you!

431
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,770
Come!

432
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:10,820
- Have a seat!
- Thank you.

433
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:15,960
You said just now you agreed with my take on staying vigilant.

434
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,060
I don't think that's necessarily the case.

435
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:22,840
Unless you're a lady with the appearance of an eighteen-year-old and the mentality of a fifty-eight-year-old.

436
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:30,020
Chairman Liu, if you don't mind,

437
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,620
I'd like to apologize to you in person.

438
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,390
Apologize for what?

439
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:38,500
I'm Huikang's sales director, Luo Jia.

440
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,520
I caused a lot of trouble for you

441
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,650
when there was a problem with O&T's logistics server.

442
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:46,490
I sincerely apologize.

443
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:49,010
Then I solemnly accept your apology.

444
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:51,360
It just so happens that I have a few questions to ask you.

445
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,030
- Can we have a chat?
- Of course!

446
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:56,570
Is the problem with the logistics server

447
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:59,080
completely solved?

448
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:03,160
From the technical standpoint, it's been solved.

449
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,380
Are you familiar with O&T?

450
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:10,870
I'm more than willing to learn more about it from your introduction of the company.

451
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:15,620
Luo Jia, you catch on very quickly.

452
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:19,340
O&T is involved in real estate, logistics,

453
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,840
building materials, communications, video, and more.

454
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,680
There's at least ten areas we work in.

455
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,890
Every area is worth more than a hundred million.

456
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:30,320
We've encountered many difficult problems now.

457
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,170
The problems you mentioned, can I understand as

458
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:36,250
you want to combine all the sectors

459
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:40,290
of O&T into an industrial chain,

460
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:43,570
to form a fleet at sea

461
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:47,300
instead of ships that fight their own battles?

462
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,630
Come!

463
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:59,060
Let me say a few more things.

464
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,430
Let me introduce you to everyone.

465
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:07,450
This is Huikang's very beautiful Luo Jia.

466
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:15,220
I'm in my sixties now.

467
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,970
It's the year in which I openly accept all criticism.

468
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:21,360
What she just said, you all might not believe,

469
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,070
but I do.

470
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:26,550
This is how young people should be.

471
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:30,190
They should have a longing for the future.

472
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:33,800
The future, to me,

473
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:37,010
it's a dread.

474
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:40,640
To be honest,

475
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:45,150
I really did understand what Chairman Liu said about being vigilant.

476
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,440
Thank you, everyone.

477

They're Huikang's biggest client in Beijing.

It's important to note that he has a very high alcohol tolerance.

486
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,470
This client—

487
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,740
is personally tended to by Luo Jia.

488
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:20,660
We'll go with him.

489
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,490
A professional salesperson likes to compare their customers to animals.

490
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:34,790
What's going on? Cui Long, what's up with you guys?

491
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:38,420
We're working.

492
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,810
Know what's proper, okay?

493
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:48,820
A professional salesperson likes to compare their clients to animals,

494
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:52,880
because it's simple, intuitive, and clear to categorize.

495
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:58,140
Chairman Zhang is obviously a typical peacock client.

496
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:01,470
He speaks quickly, likes to show off, and values interpersonal relationships.

497
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:04,910
At the same time, his alcohol tolerance is very high.

498
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:07,620
My dad surrounds himself with a lot of people like this.

499
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,800
Ye Chao Dong! You, Xie Yi, and Cui Long, you three

500
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,190
will make up a team.

501
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:20,840
First, we need to take down the director of their purchasing department, Director Mei.

502
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,850
You still need to keep an eye on Chairman Zhang.

503
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:26,670
Bring the client to our side starting with the people at the bottom.

504
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,700
It's okay if it takes some time.

505
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:32,430
- At least make some room for me to intercept.
- Let me point something out.

506
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:34,660
Director Mei and Chairman Zhang are good friends.

507
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,230
Okay.

508
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,810
Director Zhou,

509
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:41,460
how can the few of us beat Huikang?

510
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,950
We haven't tried yet, have we?

511
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:45,060
How can you be sure that we can't when we haven't even tried?

512
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,740
Where do we even start?

513
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,200
- Yeah.
- How can we beat them?

514
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,170
I've been in the North China Region for many months now.

515
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:05,020
Aside from Fang Wei and Cui Long, none of you are a new employee, aren't you?

516
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,850
Do you need me to hold your hand in teaching you how to take their clients?

517
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:11,490
Do you even need me to teach you? Do you need me to teach you?

518
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,740
Everyone, remember!

519
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,920
When faced...

520
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,530
When faced with such clients,

521
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,540
first, you've to make sure they understand

522
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:39,260
that they'll be in trouble in the future if they don't purchase our products.

523
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:42,860
It's called competing for demand.

524
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:46,110
Please take note of this.

525
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,640
- Compete for demand.
- Compete for demand.

526
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,170
Next—

527
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:53,710
If the clients were that easily swayed,

528
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:56,820
wouldn't our company be working on every project there is?

529
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:08,480
Ye Chao Dong, I've a favor to ask you.

530
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,340
Engrave every single word from the O&T example

531
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:14,150
into their minds.

532
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:16,130
Especially him!

533
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:18,470
I learned another new thing.

534
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:20,530
Meeting adjourned!

535
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,370
What's wrong?

536
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:27,250
All right, here. Come here!

537
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:31,610
Take a look! Come over. Come closer.

538
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:34,020
Write this down!

539
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,860
Fang Wei!

540
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:07,590
❝ One Half ❞ by Mo Fei Ding Lu

♫  The sun has only shone halfway  ♫

542
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:16,920
♫  The freckles on my face are bright and dark  ♫

543
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,130
♫  Oh...  ♫

544
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:25,170
♫  Who sung the song halfway through  ♫

545
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:31,050
♫  Leaving behind the roars of the chorus in an empty room  ♫

546
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:34,030
♫ I...  ♫

547
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:40,910
♫  Slowly tidied up the embarrassment of the dispersing crowd  ♫

548
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:49,030
♫  Who would abruptly break off the lingering care of the past?  ♫

549
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:51,670
♫  You deserved it, someone said  ♫

550
00:42:51,670 --> 00:43:02,930
♫  It would be for the best that the story stays unfinished  ♫

551
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:09,790
♫  Those words were spoken halfway  ♫

552
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:13,700
♫  When those few words reached the tip of the tongue  ♫

553
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:17,260
♫  It would take several years to accept  ♫

554
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:23,890
♫  Whose heart is closed midway from now on  ♫

555
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:31,460
♫  Locking up all the endless insomnia in the past?  ♫

556
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:38,020
♫  Some words are only spoken halfway  ♫

557
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:41,950
♫  To adjust the emotional intensity afterwards  ♫

558
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:45,510
♫  Just air-dry it slowly with time  ♫

559
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:52,040
♫  Whose heart will miss a half from now on  ♫

560
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,080
♫  Just let it totally submerge  ♫

561
00:43:54,080 --> 00:44:01,060
♫  My remaining dimness  ♫

562
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:07,010
♫  The other half  ♫

563
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,800
♫  The other half  ♫

564
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:20,480
♫  The other half  ♫
