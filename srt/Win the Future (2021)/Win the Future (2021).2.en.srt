Before I start, I want to ask my fellow colleagues,

31
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,560
don't you think

32
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,140
the data in your proposals are too idealistic?

33

Director Zhou, what you want to say, just go ahead and tell us.

00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,200
Let me explain!

35
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,490
The idealistic test index is in regards to the fact that

38

Of course, twenty degrees Celsius is too ideal.

How about our data?

40
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:51,430

00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:56,580
By the way, about O&T's new negotiation date,

178
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,360
when will you announce it?

179
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,100
According to what we've done before, it should be tomorrow.

180
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,270
I heard that Jieke suddenly changed their leader for the project.

181
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:08,090
I'm sorry, President Lin.

182
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,830
Zhou Rui is here.

183
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:13,340
He burned up his own proposal with fire and stunned everyone.

184
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,520
Zhou Rui burned his winning ticket?

185
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,070
How interesting!

186
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:23,530
Everyone in the industry knows that O&T's project is the last resort for Jieke.

187
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:27,190
It seems like Jieke will have to announce their doom in advance due to Zhou Rui's actions.

188
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:31,840
Chen Ming Kai doesn't seem to know that it's a taboo to switch out a leader during the middle of a battle.

189
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:37,200
It looks like that O&T's project might be Jieke's last attempt at a hopeless situation.

190
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,750
They only have one life; they can work hard temporarily, but not forever.

191
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,470
We're winning this project for sure.

192
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,170
I know!

193
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,770
Huikang's sales queen never loses.

194
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,680
Let me tell you a secret.

195
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,540
You have to pay special attention to Jieke

196
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,360
because the board of directors has included Jieke in their acquisition plan.

197
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,130
President Lin!

198
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,780
[Master]

199
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,170
Hello, Master?

200
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,930
Right now?

201
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:33,100
[Bobar Whisky & Cocktail]

202
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,010
Master.

203
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:53,550
The situation is urgent, but it isn't this urgent.

204
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm sorry, Master.

205
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,660
I hung up on you today because I was with Du Heng.

206
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,290
Do you know Du Heng well?

207
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,910
Du Heng and I are of the same generation.

208
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:07,790
I could see the sincerity in his eyes.

209
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:11,850
When did you start believing in what people have in their eyes?

210
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,830
Do you think you're dating him?

211
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,630
Master, you taught me that

212
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:19,770
being a salesperson is like dating their customers.

213
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:25,190
What's your backup plan?

214
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:30,190
I don't have a backup, just a hunch.

215
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:33,870
- About what?
- I'm waiting for the other party to make mistakes.

216
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:41,500
All these years, Huikang has never made any mistakes.

217
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:45,570
Luo Jia has never missed.

218
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,470
Lin Zhen Wei is an old fox.

219
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,250
If he wins the O&T project,

220
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,650
he'll come after us next.

221
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:56,630
But the decision hasn't been finalized yet.

222
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:03,140
Everyone knows that I had Wei Yan go on a long break

223
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,600
just to make room for you.

224
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,550
Yet you managed to ruin this.

225
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:15,930
Do you want me to go talk to Wei Yan

226
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,280
or are you going to do it yourself?

227
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:22,650
Do you really think that's necessary?

228
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:29,170
I didn't expect Sister to really be able to run this place.

229
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:32,960
I thought it was just another one of her crazy ideas.

230
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,510
Yeah!

231
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:42,280
I thought it was because of me,

232
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,660
but then I realized, she did it for herself.

233
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,370
Master, take your time drinking.

234
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:59,440
This is nothing. Here!

235
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:49,280
Luo Jia, we need to do another round of testing for the stability of the product.

236
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,980
Get ready yourself.

237
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,790
Du Heng.

238
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:11,040
- Director Zhou?
- Why is it you again?

239
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,090
The company stopped recruiting people to take care of the water, electricity, cooling, and heating.

240
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:19,660
So these dirty and tiring tasks can only be carried by the people in the Administration Department.

241
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,080
You're so competent.

242
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:33,510
The pipe is long so you'll have to wait for a moment for the hot water to come back on.

243
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,250
You dropped something.

244
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,530
A resume?

245
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,750
It's my resume.

246
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:45,540
I want to work for another company.

247
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:48,140
I think our company is hopeless.

248
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,390
Then do you think there's any hope for the company you want to work for?

249
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:55,920
At least, they'll let me do the things I want.

250
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,110
- Like what?
- Sales.

251
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,350
Move aside!

252
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,600
Director Zhou, have you been looking for me?

253
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,000
Any news from O&T?

254
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,600
No.

255
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,700
- Ask them!
- I won't ask.

256
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,200
Director Zhou, I don't know how you do things in the East China Region,

257
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,800
but this is the North China Region.

258
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,200
Why would go that far as ruining others' livelihoods?

259
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,800
You go ahead and play at being all classy.

260
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,800
About our list of orders, also stop being interested in them.

261
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,100
Sure! You aren't going to ask, are you?

262
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,050
I'll ask.

263
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,940
There's no more game, but he can still laugh.

264
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,100
He really is unique.

265
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,500
In my opinion, the game's still on.

266
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,920
Excuse me for telling it frankly!

267
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,800
In the sales profession,

268
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,800
first, you aren't the only one who has skills.

269
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:11,000
Second, at least, Director Wei is willing to teach us.

270
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,800
Zhou Rui, tomorrow is product testing and the opponent is Huikang.

271
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,400
It's your last chance. Du Heng.

272
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,800
Yes.

273
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,500
Confirm it again with Manager Li for me.

274
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,200
Director Luo, why are you here?

275
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,100
Go back to your work then.

276
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,700
Actually, President Du, you know why I'm here.

277
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,000
You really shouldn't have come.

278
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,400
I know!

279
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I really do know.

280
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,800
But I'm just curious.

281
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,200
Did Zhou Rui's five minutes impress you,

282
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,600
or is it the two of you tech guys admiring each other?

283
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,300
Actually, I don't feel nervous about anything.

284
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,300
I'm...

285
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:12,970
just here to visit you.

286
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:18,300
After seeing you, I found that there's nothing for me to say.

287
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,400
That's right, Director Wei!

288
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:26,000
I don't know why, but O&T suddenly changed their mind.

289
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
They said they wanted to do additional testing.

290
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,380
Director Wei, should we do it or not?

291
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,100
Okay, okay, okay! Director Wei, continue with your work.

292
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,800
Brother Dong, what did Director Wei say?

293
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:46,000
Director Wei said, whatever Director Zhou says to do, we'll do.

294
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,600
So everyone likes to have meetings here.

295
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,000
I'll talk about it here then.

296
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,700
For the testing tomorrow,

297
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,500
Xiao Yun, you'll record at the site tomorrow.

298
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,500
Xie Yi, you're responsible for guiding.

299
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,900
Ye Chaodong, what about the garage?

300
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,800
Director Zhou, I apologize!

301
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,400
I have a meeting with the multimedia tomorrow.

302
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,700
- It was scheduled a while back and can't be rescheduled.
- Sure!

303
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,400
Director Zhou.

304
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,400
There are many people in the Sales department, so why are you assigning only us tasks?

305
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,950
It's because only you guys have nothing to do.

306
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,300
Shouldn't this what the IT department be doing?

307
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,010
O&T suddenly added a section on product testing.

308
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:42,000
It must be Zhou Rui's trick behind the scenes.

309
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,100
Be prepared! Our equipment's reading and calculation speed must be even faster.

310
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,200
It's already at the maximum limit, Director Luo. Come and take a look!

311
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,600

315
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,800
Say something that I can understand.

316
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,700
- There is a way that isn't the usual way.
- Say it!

Set up overclocking to increase the CPU's frequency, but...

318
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,200
There are no "buts."

319
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,800
If we do this, the processing speed can increase,

320
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,700
but the stability will decrease drastically.

321
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,900
Are all tech guys like you so conservative?

322
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,600
Do what I say! This test will take place in Jieke.

323
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,200
- Hello! Are you here to participate in the O&T product testing?
- No, no!

324
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,900
Are you here to attend the O&T product testing?

325
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,400
Yes, yes! You're blocking my way.

326
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,000
This way, please!

327
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,400
Today, we're doing product testing for Jieke and Huikang.

328
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,200
Huikang uses optimized computing equipment.

329
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,400
The ratio between the CPU and the storage is 1 to 2, meaning 64C to 128G.

330
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,800
Jieke uses optimized memory equipment.

331
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:14,200
The ratio between the CPU and the storage is 1 to 8, meaning 32C to 256G.

332
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,860
The focus of each of the two companies is very clear.

333
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,700
Huikang emphasizes the CPU's processing power;

334
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,800
whereas, Jieke is emphasizing the scalability of its internal memory.

335
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,800
In this stress test, we're using equipment testing software.

336
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,800
In the first round, we will test the CPU.

337
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,810
The two companies' equipment will be started at the same time.

338
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,700
The one with the higher values will win.

339
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,700

349
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,100
You've noticed it, too?

350
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,400
This speed isn't what a regular CPU can reach.

351
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,400
They're playing a trick.

352
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,600
He just dares not compete with us on speed, so he wants to compete on reliability.

353
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,500
He wants to change the rules, so we have no choice but to play along.

354
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,090
Once the CPU's speed is adjusted higher,

355
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,600
the processing ability won't get higher after a certain amount of time.

356
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,400
It can easily crash then.

357
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,500
Just watch! During the second round, they'll definitely control

358
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,800
the test time to be within half an hour.

359
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:28,000
After half an hour, the negative side effects of the overclocking will appear.

360
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:40,600
Can you discuss with President Du to postpone this test?

361
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,400
The client doesn't like having no one to compete with us.

362
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,900
I'm confident about winning, but I want to win in style.

363
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,500

I think the client's pain point is only one word: speed.

Under what circumstances will men change their original decision?

369

We, men, normally won't change on our own,

- You're amazing!
- Director Luo, that's really good.

376
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:49,200
Huikang's products always have had a lead in speed.

377
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,600
However, I never expected the difference to be so great.

378
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,600
It's because we're that excellent.

379
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,200
Director Luo, may we speak privately?

380
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,100
Awesome processing!

381
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,600
Come, come! Fighting!

382
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,000
- Continue in the second round, Engineer Liu.
- Okay.

383
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,800
It was supposed to be Jieke dominating the show,

384
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,590
but now, it's Huikang.

That isn't important.

I already told you.

388
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,800
No opponent can resurrect itself in my hands, including you.

389
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,400
I really don't know if resurrection is impossible, but I know you're scared.

390
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,600
You're even using overclocking.

391
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,100
The result is more important than the process.

392
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,700
What if I ask President Du to extend the time by 20 minutes,

393
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,500
- will you agree?
- I won't agree.

394
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,400
But what if President Du wants to try?

395
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,000
Based on my understanding of him, he won't.

396
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,200
You used overclocking to cheat the client.

397
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,000
You've gone too far doing it this way.

399
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,200

Zhou Rui, let go! Let go of me!

Huikang's advantages have been more prominent in the short term.

414
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,260
Director Du, let's start the second round.

415
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,090
- Come on!
- Storage capacity test.

416
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:07,100
Alright then.

417
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,420
The second round is a competition on storage capacity.

418
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:13,530
The winner will be the one who stores a greater amount of memory in the allotted time of thirty minutes.

419
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:16,310
Director Du, I suggest

420
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:19,040
to extend the running time to a more appropriate time.

421
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,750
This way, we'll be able to better access the stability and durability of the equipment.

422
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,650
We won't be able to find the problems in just thirty minutes.

423
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:28,550
If we can extend the test time to 50 minutes,

424
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:31,540
- it can further demonstrate our abilities.
- President Du,

425
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:34,060
let's start after Director Luo comes back.

426
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,400

428
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:44,260

430

- Where's Director Luo?
- Where did she go?

431
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,540
She isn't replying to any of my messages.

432
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,980
President Du! President Du,

433
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,590
According to the rules, the testing time is only 30 minutes.

434
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,290
I don't see the need to extend the time.

435
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:15,180
You aren't the one who can decide whether or not it's necessary.

436
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:18,310
In a real situation, what if the 31st minute had an issue, what would happen?

437
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:21,390
- Is an extra twenty minutes a problem?
- Director Zhou, we both work in technology.

438
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:23,590
- Director Du, my suggestion is to extend the time.
- Within 30 minutes, the machine...

439
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:26,360
We can more effectively eliminate the hidden problems if we test for stability.

440
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,880
In a short amount of time,

441
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,790
you won't be able to be test out any minor problems.

442
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:34,090
Extending the time is a way to test.

443
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:37,990
- This–
- Let's extend the time to 50 minutes.

00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:36,610
A WeChat apology is too insincere.

517
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:41,250
Then give me a chance to apologize in person.

518
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:43,940
I was the one who overclocked our CPU first, so we're even,

519
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:48,080
but I'll make you admit defeat next time.

520
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:56,210
♫  Whose heart is closed midway from now on  ♫

521
00:41:56,210 --> 00:42:03,680
♫  Locking up all the endless insomnia in the past?  ♫

522
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,060
♫  Some words are only spoken halfway  ♫

523
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:21,710
❝ One Half ❞ by Mo Fei Ding Lu

524
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:25,370
♫  The sun is only shining halfway  ♫

525
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:31,120
♫  The freckles on my face are bright and dark  ♫

526
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,760
♫  Oh...  ♫

527
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:39,420
♫  Who sung the song halfway through  ♫

528
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:45,320
♫  Leaving behind the roars of the chorus in an empty room  ♫

529
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:48,300
♫  I...  ♫

530
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:55,100
♫  Slowly tidied up the embarrassment of the dispersing crowd  ♫

531
00:42:55,100 --> 00:43:03,260
♫  Who would abruptly break off the lingering care of the past?  ♫

532
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:05,960
♫  You deserved it, someone said  ♫

533
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:17,150
♫  It would be for the best that the story stays unfinished  ♫

534
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:23,970
♫  Those words were spoken halfway  ♫

535
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:27,960
♫  When those few words reached the tip of the tongue  ♫

536
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:31,480
♫  It would take several years to accept  ♫

537
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:38,090
♫  Whose heart is closed midway from now on  ♫

538
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:45,570
♫  Locking up all the past rainy nights of being restless  ♫

539
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:52,220
♫  Some words are only spoken halfway  ♫

540
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:56,180
♫  To adjust the emotional intensity afterwards  ♫

541
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:59,830
♫  Just air-dry it slowly with time  ♫

542
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:06,370
♫  Whose heart will miss a half from now on  ♫

543
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:08,390
♫  Just let it totally submerge  ♫

544
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:15,410
♫  My remaining dimness  ♫

545
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:21,060
♫  The other half  ♫

546
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:27,110
♫  The other half  ♫

547
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:34,560
♫  The other half  ♫
