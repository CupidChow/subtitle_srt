22
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:42,500
If... I mean if,

23
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,940
If I take on this project, for the price, terms of payment,

24
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,070
arrival time, engineering time,

25
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,520
service plan, personnel ratio, response time,

26
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,870
including maintenance,

27
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:59,300
what can you offer me?

28
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,900
Don't hold back! Just go ahead and tell me.

29
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,910
- Ladies first?
- Okay, I'll go first.

30
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,320
President Du, Huikang's response time

31
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,910
and backup storage is superb.

32
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:19,810
These are the two things other companies don't have and are most likely to ignore.

33
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:24,650
Let's do this! I'm willing to offer you an extra year of maintenance,

34
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:28,230
and handle your emergencies within 24 hours.

35
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,160
Additionally, we'll offer you three resident engineers.

36
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,410
I'm sure you know the value of these offers.

37
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:42,430
Then is one year your limit for maintenance?

38
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,780
With Huikang's product quality, one year of maintenance is more than enough.

39
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,600
President Du, I must say something that I shouldn't say.

40
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,360
I'm sure that you already know

41
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,390
about the general knowledge in our industry.

42
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,820
If the planner or the leader of a project doesn't come

43
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,640
from a technical background,

44
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,820
they better not make any mistakes.

45
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,440
Once something goes wrong, the consequences are unimaginable.

46
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,220
I've said too much.

47
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:40,580
Director Zhou, I have one last question for you.

48
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,580
Director Luo's offer for maintenance terms,

49
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,950
can your Jieke match that?

50
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:50,580
Or in other words, Director Luo, can Huikang offer

51
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,210
the same engineering plan as Jieke?

52
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,360
What about the price?

53
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,010
Please state your final prices.

54
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,600
I don't think it's necessary to give the prices in secret.

55
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,890
Because you've given the same price once again.

56
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:46,170
Let's just call out the bids then.

57
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,460
Who wants to go first?

58
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,430
Why don't you go first this time, Director Zhou?

59
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:07,800
One hundred sixty six million.

60
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,870
One hundred sixty five point five million.

61
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,100
One hundred sixty five million.

62
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,930
One hundred sixty four million.

63
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:53,450
Are you sure, Director Luo?

64
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,720
Director Luo!

65
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,810
Are you sure?

66
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,960
I'm sure.

67
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,460
Congratulations!

68
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,030
Condolences!

69
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,790
You're fighting over low prices.

70
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,390
Likewise!

71
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,680
I didn't expect you to go down to one hundred sixty five million.

72
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,950
I really admire your courage.

73
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,750
You clearly know that you won't make a profit with that bid,

74
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,100
yet you still insist on taking me down.

75
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,970
You can apologize to me now.

76
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:40,180
Why would I apologize if I already lost?

77
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,350
If you apologize to me now, I can consider forgiving you.

78
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,340
Five.

79
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,540
Four.

80
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,210
Three.

81
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,680
Two.

[Nurse Yu]

83
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,550
- Hello?
- Miss Luo.

84
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,620
I saw that you had an appointment for your third progesterone injection for next Sunday.

85
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,100
If you don't get the injection in time, it'll cause irregularities in your menstrual cycle,

86
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,640
it may even accelerate ovarian aging.

87
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,390
So be sure to make it to your appointment.

88
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,870
Okay. I got it.

89
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,660
Okay. Then I'll see you on Sunday.

90
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,440
Okay. Bye bye.

91
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,740
Zhou Rui.

92
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,240
- President Du.
- Bidding is a skill and calling for bids is a craft.

93
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,870
Your performance with Director Luo today has left quite an impression on me.

94
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:55,620
However, do you really think Luo Jia is that determined to win?

95
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:59,290
They're harming themselves to harm us even more.

96
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,580
Are you willing to admit defeat?

97
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:06,270
President Du, the O&T project,

98
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,020
I won't lose.

99
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,800
but I admit defeat to Luo Jia.

100
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,220
This wine was given to me by your President Chen.

101
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,000
I don't know anything about wine so there's no point in me having it.

102
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,890
No, my master gave this to you as a gift.

103
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,370

Lose once in a while so others can have a chance.

119
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,250
Why on earth, Director Luo?

120
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,510
- Aren't you being too stubborn?
- Director Luo, Director Luo.

121
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:06,220
- Do you know how much pressure your bid...
- It isn't that we didn't let you know our bottom line.

122
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,140
- ...gives us?
- The sale price was one million below the reserve price.

123
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,220
President Lin personally agreed, which is why we have work.

124
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,430
- By doing this, you've implicated us all!
- What twill we do??

125
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:14,780
- Do you think so, too?
- Director Luo, why don't you go to discuss it with President Lin?

126
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:17,750
Our department can't do anything about the contract.

127
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,570
All departments of Huikang

128
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:27,550
from finance, law, market,

129
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:31,690
down to security and janitorial, which of you doesn't rely on our sales department?

130
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,010
If we lose, where will we get the contract to sign?

131
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:37,080
Where are the report forms? Reserve price?

132
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:42,990
Let me tell you all! My, Luo Jia's, price is Huikang's reserve price.

133
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,360
But this company isn't owned by anyone with the surname Luo, is it?

134
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,450
- Director Luo, so you're saying the other departments aren't needed?
- What do you mean forget about it?

135
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,680
- You don't get to make all the decisions!
- When did you become the owner of the company?

136
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,880
Who do you think we are?

137
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,880
-Leave! Go, go, go!
- Get out of our department!

138
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,430
- Get out of our department!
- President Lin hasn't said anything yet!

139
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,460
- Seriously!
- Go! Get out!

140
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,880
The Marketing Department always has the most problems.

141
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,760
- Director Zhou is back.
- Is Director Zhou back?

142
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,750
- Is he back?
- Director Zhou is back.

143
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,180
Is he really back?

144
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,250
He's in a bad mood?

145
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,770
- What should we do?
- I'll go and take a look.

146
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:25,410
Now, I really miss the time when Director Wei was in charge.

147
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:30,250
Insider information says the company will be restructured

148
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,890
- Where will you go and who will you follow?
- Restructuring?

149
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:36,910
You'll all need to make a decision soon.

150
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:40,220
- I was afraid of this.
- Who should I pick?

151
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,170
How is it a difficult decision to make?

152
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:45,520
You like Zhou Rui so, of course, you must pick him.

153
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,280
You aren't like Xiao Yun who only wants a stable job.

154
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,280
I guess I'll pick Director Wei.

155
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,980
Don't even guess about Xiao Ye! He will surely want Director Wei.

- Listen, listen!
- Keep taking it!

If you guys still don't take the red envelopes, I won't send them anymore.

00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:42,440
- So much?
- How much did you get?

174
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,020
I got a big one.

175
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,170
I got eight.

176
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,740
I got eighty.

177
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:52,220
I think, when losing,

178
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,040
we need more encouragement.

179
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,040
It's raining red envelopes. Catch them!

180
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,640
Let me see!

181
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,630
Di you hear that?

182
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:06,320
Did you hear that? If you lose, you have red envelopes to snatch.

183
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,600
Snatch them! Snatch them with all your might.

184
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,040
Lose it with all your might, too.

185
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,080
How much did you get?

186
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,570
I snatched 28!

187
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,790
Come in.

188
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,600
Director Zhou, you were looking for me?

189
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,960
Your wish

190
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,140
is going to have to wait.

191
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,310
I understand.

192
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,710
If you need anything, call me anytime.

193
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,140
Look for this person's address!

194
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,400
Okay.

195
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,660
Did you come for an apology?

196
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,490
Master, I'm ready to face the consequences.

197
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,970
I can't face it!

198
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,490
How will you deal with it?

199
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:27,120
Huikang touched my bottom line.

200
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,840
They lost even though they won.

201
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,790
I can't accept a business deal that would cause us to have a loss.

202
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:35,030
I'm sure Director Wei knows the company's situation more than I do.

203
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:38,470
- What if it were you?
- If it were me?

204
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,240
I don't get to make the decisions, remember?

205
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,680
I'm not involved in this.

206
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:49,290
This quarter's collection ratio is at a record low.

207
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:51,820
The company is running out of cash.

208
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,640
If this continues, we'll have trouble staying open.

209
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,600
Initially, we placed all our hope on O&T.

210
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,380
But now?

211
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:12,690
Tell me, what plans do the two of you have?

212
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,060
I'm just a new comer in Beijing,

213
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,810
Director Wei can go first.

214
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:25,460
Next quarter, my sales department will,

215
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,520
first increase sales by twenty percent.

216
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,290
Twenty percent?

217
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:01,330
President Lin, can you give me some more time

218
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,920
before I report the situation?

219
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,470
You won, so why aren't you happy?

220
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:18,220
It's because I went past my bottom line this time.

221
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:22,650
However, if I didn't continue reducing the price,

222
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,820
we would've lost the deal.

223
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,460
Look!

224
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:33,040
I just bought a new collaboration edition. How is it?

225
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,490
A lot of people asked about it during my livestream.

226
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:41,330
It looks good.

227
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:47,030
Should I award you or punish you?

228
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,380
It's up to you.

229
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:54,390
Are the other departments currently angry at you?

230
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,130
I'm used to it already.

231
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,840
Then I'll choose to be neutral.

232
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,820
After all, you won against Jieke.

233
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,790
In the long run, it won't harm the company,

234
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:08,140
nor will it align with my plans.

235
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,850
It's really easy to meet the King of Hell.

236
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,280
The little demon is being difficult.

237
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,830
Boss, your face...

238
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,600
It's easy to see the King of Hell, but it isn't a pleasant meeting.

239
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,000
[Tai Koo Li]

240
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,170
How much effort did it take

241
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,720
to make your heel look like this?

242
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,680
Okay. Then tell me!

243
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,200
How are you going to restore my shoes?

244
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,470
Our company's shoes need to be taken back to the factory to be fixed.

245
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:10,060
But, your heels have already been discontinued.

246
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,960
However, I thought that you would want the shoe heel's color and height to be the same

247
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,820
so I talked to the manufacturer.

248
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,900
I said I'd provide the heel and they'll be in charge of repairing the shoe.

249
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,090
But, I've already thrown out the heel.

250
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:23,850
But your shoes are still here. Although your shoes are limited edition,

251
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:26,990
China still has at least 200 pairs left.

252
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:30,700
I believed I could find out if someone bought them and didn't wear them or bought second-hand,

253
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,410
in the end, I found them.

254
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:35,870
A pair in Nanjing and a pair in Hong Kong, both 9.5 stars.

255
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:39,300
- It's similar to this pair.
- What do you mean?

256
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:43,520
You mean that you bought a pair of shoes just to repair my shoes' heels?

257
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,870
Relax. I'll negotiate with the seller

258
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:48,580
to see if we can barter.

259
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,880
No matter how you exchange it, you still spent your own money.

260
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,950
As a staff, we get full privileges.

261
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:57,560
I gave the coupon to the seller.

262
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,920
The seller can buy shoes from us

263
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,790
and they can fix your heel for you as well.

264
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:04,230
Isn't this killing two birds with one stone?

265
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:13,570
Xiao Le, can I compliment you?

266
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,720
You scared me.

267
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,520
I like being complimented.

268
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,520
You're a talent in an undeserving role.

269
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,020
Indeed, I like selling shoes.

270
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,550
Here you go.

271
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,660
But I still need to treat you to a meal.

272
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,330
You really don't need to, Sister Jia.

273
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,270
I'll teach you one thing.

274
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:35,830
Never reject a customer.

275
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:52,010
You two, switch spots!

276
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:58,120
[Jieke Company]

277
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,470
We can't trust people anymore, so we can only trust fate.

278
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:16,100
The purpose of today's meeting is to formulate

279
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,740
next quarter's sales plan.

280
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,750
I'll begin with giving you all a heads up.

281
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,400
Director Wei has already stated that he wants to lead the team

282
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,850
to increase the company's performance by twenty percent.

283
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,220
Director Zhou, tell us what your thoughts are.

284
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:42,540
First, I'd like to apologize to everyone.

285
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,460
It's my fault that we were unable to secure O&T.

286
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,220
With the recent takeover of the business of the Northern China area,

287
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,520
it's true that I'm not as confident as Director Wei in

288
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,060
increasing performance by twenty percent.

289
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,940
Unless we include my performance in East China.

290
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,450
Forget about the East China.

291
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:04,920
Since you've brought up this matter, I'll announce

292
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:09,050
the company's decision regarding the regional distribution for you two.

293
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,200
The board of directors is making the following adjustments

294
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,300
based on the current situation of Jieke and the direction the company is developing in.

295
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,800
Zhou Rui is appointed as the Director of Sales of the Beijing Region

296
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,400
reporting directly to me.

297
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,400
Wei Yan is appointed as the entire North China Region

298
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,500
except for Bejing Director of Sales, also reporting to me.

299
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:35,400
We're regrouping the teams and the two of you can create that list yourselves.

300
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,000
The group that does not meet the sales targets at the end of the quarter

301
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,300
will be eliminated, no matter which team it is.

302
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,800
The person in charge will directly lead the performance improvement plan.

303
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:48,240
Other regions are no exception.

304
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:53,000
Wei Xiang, talk about how the Northeast Region is doing.

305
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,300
Our region...

306
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:59,200
President Chen, why don't I talk to you individually about this after the meeting?

307
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,800
Sure!

308
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,600
Xiao Ye, why don't you share with us?

309
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,800
Okay.

310
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,800
The sales of the Beijing Region have been uninspiring

311
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,600
There are many ministries and commissions

312
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,600
as well as large headquarters in Beijing.

313
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,600
There are banks, communication systems, and transportation systems.

314
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,100
Any of their orders will give us a volume of an entire province.

315
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:37,000
Hence, I believe, we have a lot of potential opportunities in Beijing.

316
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,800
Our performance in the new quarter will test our ability to secure these opportunities.

317
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,300
But I have to be honest with you.

318
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:46,630
We shouldn't underestimate the abilities of our competitors.

319
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,600
I don't think I'll be able

320
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,200
to improve our sales performance in Beijing

321
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:57,150
by the end of the quarter.

322
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,800
I think it's impossible.

323
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,700
It's possible.

324
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,500
Let's take a look at them one by one.

325
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:18,270
These are the large and medium-sized clients in Beijing.

326
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,800
I did a rough calculation.

327
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,600
If we can fulfill each order,

328
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,000
it's possible to surpass our target.

329
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,300
Zhou Rui,

330
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:33,000
do you still think it's impossible after looking at this list?

331
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,900
- Zhou Rui?
- I'll try my best.

332
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,000
Great! We'll leave it at that.

333
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,100
I have another appointment to announce.

334
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,500
- Take a look at this.
- Okay.

335
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,400
Hello, President Chen, it's Yang Lu.

336
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,200
Yang Lu,

337
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:09,040
the board of directors has decided that you will be in charge of the East China Region from now on.

338
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:12,570
You'll report to Director Wei.

339
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,200
President Chen, can I think this over?

340
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,800
We still have fifteen minutes left.

341
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,700
The department heads can report on their plans and the project briefing for the next year.

342
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,000
Focus on the main points during the report.

343
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,000
Talk about the plans for a solution if there are any problems.

344
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,600
It's not a drill! Not a drill!

345
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,800
Fire alarm! Don't come this way! Don't come this way!

346
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,400
Take the fire escape route!

347
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,000
Don't go in the elevators! Take the stairs this way!

348
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
This way!

349
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,900
To be safe, leave in an orderly fashion!

350
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,600
Evacuate in an orderly fashion!

351
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,000
Fire alarm! Fire alarm!

352
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,200
Who pulled the alarm?

353
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,220
President Zhou, the fire alarm was set off as soon as you got to Beijing.

354
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,000
You're so unlucky!

355
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,500
President Wei, I'm taking on a new position, so I'm not quite there yet.

356
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,400
Director Chen, Director Zhou, we didn't find an open fire.

357
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,800
When will this be over?

358
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,400
The firefighters should still be checking everything.

359
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,400
We can go back into the office after they finish their evaluation.

360
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,200
What about the machine room? Is the machine room okay?

361
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,800
It's fine.

362
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,500
- What's your name again?
- Fang Wei.

363
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,200
I'm from the administration department.

364
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,200
Go and get some coffee or something for everyone.

365
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,300
One for each person. It's my treat!

366
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,000
Okay.

367
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,100
Who pulled the alarm?

368
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,600
It's definitely someone who's at odds with the company.

369
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,600
However, the company's layoffs did offend many people.

370
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,300
At least, they didn't try to burn down the building.

371
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,100
You were the only one who didn't say anything when everyone was attacking me just now,

372
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,800
but I don't think it's because you don't have anything to say.

373
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:57,000
Director Luo, if I say anything, it'll be my honest opinion, but the truth hurts.

374
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:01,790
The pre-sales department, legal department, and finance department were all giving me their honest opinions yesterday anyways.

375
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,600
I don't care about whether or not it hurts, just say it!

376
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,600
Actually, the technology department doesn't care about what your quote was.

377
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,300
We're only responsible for the subsequent technological solutions.

378
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:16,800
Zhou Rui comes from a technical background like me, so I understand his intentions.

379
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,400
Get to the point!

380
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,800
Zhou Rui's plan is like digging a thirty-story foundation

381
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,400
to build a three-story building.

382
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,400
The deeper you dig, the greater you invest in it.

383
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,300
It may seem like we're being a bit too cautious now.

384
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,600
But when you want to build ten or twenty more floors in the future,

385
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,900
you'll understand that his plan will save him a great amount of money in the future.

386
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:40,900
Director Luo, our plan is too short-sighted.

387
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:45,100
In terms of a win or a loss, it's just a momentary win for us.

388
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,400
Engineer Liu,

389
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,700
why are your honest opinions so pleasant to hear?

390
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,700
I understand.

391
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,000
Brother Lei, does it feel better?

392
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,600
Going off of all my years of experience,

393
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,000
this is a conflict between companies, or a conflict between departments.

394
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,800
Someone is deliberately trying to sabotage us.

395
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,600
You won't be able to return to your old nest in the East China Region anymore.

396
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,200
You don't have the final say in Beijing anymore, either.

397
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,700
Our master really has his ways.

398
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,400
He's trying to get us to put on a suit of armor and stab each other.

399
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,600
"Increase twenty percent in sales performance,"

400
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,400
didn't you pass him the knife?

401
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,600
We're fellow apprentices, so if the old man wants us to fight, then we should give it our all.

402
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,800
We'll just die together, at worst, but I won't let him down.

403
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,770
Fine! I accept the challenge.

404
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,600
You can pick your team first.

405
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,300
I'll give you the original team including Ye Chao Dong.

406
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,100
Ye Chao Dong?

407
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,800
Ma Dong Mei.
 (fictional character from the movie "Goodbye Mr. Loser")

408
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,800
Are you really willing to?

409
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,300
He's considered to be one of the best in the Beijing Region.

410
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,800
If I took all of the powerful soldiers with me,

411
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,000
it'll bring me no honor to win you.

412
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,600
Boss, forgive me for making this decision before discussing it with you.

413
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,600
There are dozens of people who rely on this to make a living.

414
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,900
You also said that I need to take good care of the East China Region before you return.

415
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Director Zhou, President Chen is asking for you.

416
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,000
This way!

417
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,600
- Master.
- We found out who pulled the alarm.

418
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:07,600
It was Tian Cheng Zhou who was originally in your technology department.

419
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,000
We laid off so many people, but only one person came back to seek revenge.

420
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,700
It's alright.

421
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,700
How do you think we should handle this?

422
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,200
Me?

423
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,400
We should just let this go

424
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,600
since it didn't cause us any loss.

425
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,700
What do you think?

426
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,600
Director Zhou, that's President Du's car.

427
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,400
- President Du.
- Zhou Rui, what are you doing here?

428
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:04,500
These are the solution plans for problems that O&T might encounter.

429
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,700
I hope this will draw your attention even though I lost.

430
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,900
Please take a look!

431
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,500
It looks like that you haven't given up yet.

432
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,400
The contracts aren't signed yet so anything is possible.

433
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,000
Even if we don't end up signing a contract, we can still be on good terms with each other.

434
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,300
Why don't you come inside?

435
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,100
It's already very rude of me to meet you here.

436
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,800
We won't enter your company to avoid suspicion.

437
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,400
Alright. I'll check it out carefully.

438
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,000
Come, Baby. Baby!

439
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,700
Look at the camera. Look at the camera. Look at the camera!

440
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,040
A restaurant! It's a luxurious restaurant.

441
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,500
Let's take a selfie. Look at the camera. Come on!

442
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,000
Hurry up! Look at the camera and smile.

443
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,100
- You're here so early, President Cao.
- Isn't that Director Zhou.

444
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,800
Director Zhou, quick, quick, quick! Please, come inside.

445
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,000
- Please, come inside.
- Okay. Thanks!

446
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,800
Come on, come on, come on!

447
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,700
Please, please, please!

448
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,300
Director Zhou.

449
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,800
You... this— What are you doing?

450
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:10,600
I'm Cao Tian You from Fast Future Technology.

451
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,600
I witnessed your feat of destroying your plan that day.

452
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,300
I admire you so much for that.

453
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,600
My dream is to become someone like you.

454
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,600
- Were you there that day, too?
- Yes, I was.

455
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,900
O&T is a high-end logistics enterprise.

456
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,700
I asked someone to get me in to learn from the best.

457
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,000
Please! Come, come, come. Have a seat!

458
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
- What ghost thing on earth is this?
- How am I supposed to know?

459
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:40,330
Director Zhou, have a seat here!

460
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:42,130
I can just sit here. Just here!

461
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:44,270
Okay, sure! It's up to you.

462
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:49,400
Xiao Ye, your Director Zhou is a true hero.

463
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,440
Here! Give it to me.

464
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,460
Come here, Baby! Okay, okay, okay. It's okay, Baby.

465
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,900
Look!

466
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:02,230
This rooster is from a remote mountain area.

467
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:05,150
It tastes the best for only these three days.

468
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,630
It's chewy and not greasy.

469
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:09,380
It'll taste smooth and tender.

470
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,120
The meat won't be as tender after another day.

471
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,580
This rooster came from

472
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:17,770
the mountain areas of Qingyuan in Guangdong all the way here to you.

473
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:19,910
- Guess how many days it took to get here?
- Wait!

474
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:22,520
What is it exactly that you're trying to say?

475
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,290
Three days.

476
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:26,490
Here! Xiao Ye, hold this.

477
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:29,060
Just three days!

478
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:32,570
It's because of our Fast Future Technology.

479
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:36,100
Our name is a homonym of fast.

480
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:01,360
[How do women see through scammers upon first glance?]

481
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:05,100
President Cao, I understand the gist of it.

482
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,610
You're working on a rural logistics project,

483
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:10,390
- aren't you?
- That's right.

484
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:11,970
- Sit down! Sit down!
- Okay.

485
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:14,180
I'm telling you, Director Zhou.

486
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,560
What you said just now was amazing.

487
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,870
I've always had a dream

488
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:24,570
to start sharing the use of the idle mini-busses,

489
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:27,220
trucks, tractors, three-wheelers,

490
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:30,430
including ox-wagons and carriages in the countryside.

491
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:34,570
They all make up a very powerful logistics force.
[Those who make empty promises are all scammers.]

492
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,920
- Director Zhou, you must not think that I'm a scammer.
- No, no, no! I wasn't laughing at you.

493
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,700
Really! Our company has worked with Huikang.

494
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,640
Their servers are cheaper than yours.

495
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,740
However...

496
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:51,080
I'm not trying to find cheap ways to do business.

497
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,190
I want to work with Jieke this time around

498
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:58,210
for your stable servers.

499
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:02,180
President Cao, let me give you some professional advice.

500
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,610
Please!

501
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:07,890
You want to upgrade your servers through this

502
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:12,280
to do business as a large internet

503
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,710
rural logistics company.

504
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,550
Well... that...

505
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:21,630
Large... Large scale...

506
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,350
Yes, that... that's what I meant.

507
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:26,950
Manager Ye, please convert what Director Zhou just said

508
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:30,320
and send it as text to my phone.

509
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,540
H-He said a lot of words and it's a bit difficult for me to grasp.

510
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:37,920
However, Director Zhou, being able to meet with you today

511
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,800
is exactly... is exactly more rewarding than t-ten years of studying.

512
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,400
I'm really happy.

513
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,450
Well, Xiao Ye.

514
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:50,800
Take good care of President Zhou! Right now, I'll sing a song for you.

515
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,870
This song is dedicated to my beloved Director Zhou.

516
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:55,990
I hope you'll like it.

517
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,770

00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:08,130
♫  Ah, ah, the story starts  ♫

519
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:10,340
♫  I am a bad boy  ♫

520
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:13,360
♫  Oh, oh, the storyline is pretty good  ♫

521
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,770
♫  I am a bad boy  ♫

522
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:21,900
♫  I am a bad boy  ♫

523
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:26,000
♫  I am a bad boy  ♫

♫  Ah, ah, waiting with patience  ♫

525

♫  I am a bad boy  ♫

♫  The ending can't be re-done  ♫

532
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:57,720
- Sister Jia.
- Have a seat!

533
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:06,480
You look quite nice.

534
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,830
Sister Jia, I can come to work any time now.

535
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:15,260
Do you mind starting as my assistant first?

536
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:20,860
That's more than I could ask for, so why would I mind about it?

537
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,910
The salary's not as high as you think.

538
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:27,650
Beggars can't be choosers.

539
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,130
Come in!

540
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:35,960
Director Luo, I've brought over the voice recorder you asked me to prepare.

541
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:40,240
- Take her to HR to complete her employment procedures.
- Okay. (TN: HR = Human Resources)

542
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,660
- Come with me.
- Okay.

543
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,110
I'll get going then.

544
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,010
Xiao Le!

545
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:51,600
Yes, Sister Jia?

546
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,290
In the future, call me Director Luo when there are other people around.

547
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:58,320
Alright, Director Luo.

548
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,970
What do assistants do?

549
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:04,040
You'll start with recording the meeting minutes and sorting the voice recordings.

550
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,600
Hello, Director Du?

551
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:17,480
- Go ahead.
- Have all the department heads on the O&T project team come here now.

552
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:22,050
Is it necessary to have that many people for a meeting?

553
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:24,100
You'll understand once you get here.

554
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:31,870
We only included our requirements in our previous bidding documents.

555
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:36,280
But there are some problems that we are unable to notice ourselves.

556
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,340
These are some problems here that we need to solve.

557
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,990
There are technical and post-sales problems,

558
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:44,340
simulated malfunction handling, etc.

559
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,580
I'll collect the papers before lunch,

560
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,820
and then treat everyone to lunch in the cafeteria.

561
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,710
It's up to you whether you want to write your ideas down or record them.

562
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:55,790
Zhou Rui's plan may seem to be too cautious now,

563
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:59,020
but when you want to add ten or twenty floors in the future,

564
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:02,480
you'll come to understand that his plan will save him a lot of money in the future.

565
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,590
Director Luo, our plan is too short-sighted.

566
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:08,100
Who wrote these questions?

567
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,560
[Simulated Malfunction Emergency Handling]

568
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,360
I handed in an empty paper this time

569
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,890
because I saw what was on the back of it.

570
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:34,250
I think the right answer you're thinking of consists of only two words.

571
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,470
Teamwork.

572
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,840
Full points.

573
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:45,230
Even if you didn't mention it, I was going to talk to you about this.

574
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:48,220
Our minds think alike.

575
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:51,410
Please go through the technological change process.

576
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:55,830
You must have an expected share in your mind.

577
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:57,400
Let me hear it!

578
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:06,040
Everything we do is for our clients.

579
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:12,130
The reason why we're willing to give Jieke ten percent of our shares is also for the sake of our client.

580
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:17,560
It's so that the client's servers can have greater scalability.

581
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,500
From a business perspective,

582
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:24,390
President Du, our Huikang will suffer an immediate loss from this.

583
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:28,150
In the past, there were many cases of company cooperations within the sales industry.

584
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:32,100
How can you be sure that Zhou Rui will agree?

585
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:38,870
Do you think he'll accept your generosity for ten percent of the shares?

586
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,440
Be honest with me about this cooperation!

587
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,440
Do you really feel that strongly about it?

588
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:50,580
Of course, I'd like to see it happen.

589
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:53,250
However, I'm not sure

590
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:55,690
if your President Lin will agree to that.

591
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:58,740
Leaders also manage the expected profits.

592
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,770
Thirty percent.

593
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:05,920
President Du, you're taking advantage of us now.

594
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,630
- Thirty percent is impossible.
- Ten percent is too little.

595
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:12,880
I really can't do thirty percent.

596
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,630
Fine! We'll do this.

597
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:17,790
Let's go back and discuss this.

598
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:20,900
I'll tell you what we decide before we sign the contracts.

599
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:24,090
We'll work together if it's doable.

600
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:26,310
I'll be waiting to hear from you.

601
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:31,080
You only get one chance.

602
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:34,790
No problem!
