3
00:00:07,221 --> 00:00:08,561
CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS, INCIDENTS,
AND GROUPS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

4
00:00:08,561 --> 00:00:09,891
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED SAFELY
WITH THEIR GUARDIANS PRESENT.

5
00:00:09,891 --> 00:00:11,214
THE SCENES WITH ANIMALS WERE ALSO FILMED
SAFELY WITH THE ADVICE OF EXPERTS.

6
00:00:11,238 --> 00:00:14,160
DRUG USE ISNâ€™T JUST A MERE DEVIATION BUT A SERIOUS CRIME A SINGLE WRONG
CHOICE CAN DESTROY AN INDIVIDUAL, A FAMILY, AND SOCIETY AS A WHOLE

7
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:17,451
I don't need billions.
My dream is to have a small place

8
00:00:17,491 --> 00:00:19,051
to live with my family.

9
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:21,761
But now, our house is going up for auction!

10
00:00:22,031 --> 00:00:23,871
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma?

11
00:00:23,911 --> 00:00:25,331
There's virtually no hope.

12
00:00:25,371 --> 00:00:26,991
Dad will die without money.

13
00:00:27,751 --> 00:00:29,701
I wish a bag of cash
fell from the sky.

14
00:00:29,741 --> 00:00:31,611
Where did this come from?

15
00:00:31,921 --> 00:00:33,201
200 million every month?

16
00:00:33,201 --> 00:00:35,371
James?
He only deals with VIPs.

17
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,201
You're James, aren't you?

18
00:00:40,251 --> 00:00:42,201
Let's be partners.
You and me.

19
00:00:42,741 --> 00:00:47,201
The quiet art tutor
turns out to be a drug dealer...

20
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:51,871
For me, these are like game chips.

21
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:54,991
To get me to the real prize.

22
00:00:55,701 --> 00:00:57,121
My gift, brand new.

23
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:01,101
But with this,
no one gets hurt.

24
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:04,781
No one forces it.
They do it because they want to.

25
00:01:05,201 --> 00:01:06,911
I'm curious.

26
00:01:07,411 --> 00:01:10,371
What else can the lady give me?

27
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:13,041
I hope this doesn't screw me over.

28
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:15,951
If you don't find the bag,
it won't end with your brother's finger.

29
00:01:17,481 --> 00:01:18,431
I'll take care of him.

30
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:20,531
You little pussy!

31
00:01:23,781 --> 00:01:24,741
Run!

32
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:28,621
- What? Room 3?
- Room 3?

33
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:32,101
Are you sure it's room 3?

34
00:01:37,781 --> 00:01:41,991
There are countless dealers,
but there's no one safer than him.

35
00:01:42,021 --> 00:01:45,531
This is more than my 3 months'
worth of salary at the store.

36
00:01:45,811 --> 00:01:48,201
Boss, what should I do with the thief?

37
00:01:48,201 --> 00:01:49,331
Kill 'em.

38
00:01:49,331 --> 00:01:51,261
I think I found your drugs.

39
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:55,201
Don't worry, Sua.
Mommy loves you.

40
00:01:58,052 --> 00:01:59,172
MEDICAL REPORT

41
00:01:59,172 --> 00:02:02,552
It's the 2nd week of Mr. Park's treatment,
and he is experiencing adverse reactions.

42
00:02:02,832 --> 00:02:04,882
The abdominal pain has gotten worse.

43
00:02:06,052 --> 00:02:09,752
As you can see here,
the cancer is spreading too fast.

44
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:12,092
So, it's gotten worse?

45
00:02:12,092 --> 00:02:16,112
Our priority is to slow down the cancer
and shrink the tumor,

46
00:02:16,132 --> 00:02:20,132
but looking at the patient's condition,
continuing chemo is out of the question.

47
00:02:20,322 --> 00:02:22,052
Then what else can we do?

48
00:02:22,072 --> 00:02:24,552
Switching to immunotherapy
would be better.

49
00:02:24,702 --> 00:02:26,552
Immunotherapy?

50
00:02:26,592 --> 00:02:30,112
Conventional chemo affects healthy cells
and has severe side effects.

51
00:02:30,152 --> 00:02:34,302
Immunotherapy activates immune cells,
so the side effects are lighter.

52
00:02:34,422 --> 00:02:38,262
Of course, for pancreatic cancer,
there isn't much solid data,

53
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:41,752
but for now it's the only option
for Mr. Park Dojin.

54
00:02:41,802 --> 00:02:43,522
- I see.
- However...

55
00:02:44,752 --> 00:02:50,092
Most immunotherapies aren't covered
by domestic health insurance.

56
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:56,282
How much is it?
Just tell me straight.

57
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:58,732
Six million won per cycle.

58
00:03:02,262 --> 00:03:03,222
Ma'am?

59
00:03:05,292 --> 00:03:07,122
Ah, sorry.

60
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:33,012
Mom, the shower's weird!

61
00:03:46,752 --> 00:03:48,712
- Is it working?
- Yeah.

62
00:03:51,712 --> 00:03:54,272
Don't eat side dishes with your hands.

63
00:03:55,712 --> 00:03:57,712
Does she have eyes
in the back of her head?

64
00:04:02,932 --> 00:04:06,242
Mom, should we switch?
To a shower filter?

65
00:04:06,292 --> 00:04:07,962
Yoojung's family uses it.

66
00:04:08,002 --> 00:04:09,842
Who's Yoojung?

67
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:12,032
A new girl in the art class.

68
00:04:12,082 --> 00:04:14,602
She was originally Jinhee's friend,
but we got close.

69
00:04:14,742 --> 00:04:15,782
Really?

70
00:04:15,842 --> 00:04:18,362
The art class got
a ton of new members.

71
00:04:18,512 --> 00:04:21,802
Most of them are more interested
in Mr. Lee than in art.

72
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:24,502
They keep asking
if he has a girlfriend or not.

73
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:27,852
So annoying.

74
00:04:36,922 --> 00:04:37,882
Mom, are you okay?

75
00:04:50,052 --> 00:04:51,252
Fuck...

76
00:04:57,172 --> 00:05:00,172
EPISODE 3

77
00:05:33,172 --> 00:05:34,132
Thank you.

78
00:05:36,052 --> 00:05:40,242
- How's your hand?
- It's... fine.

79
00:05:41,302 --> 00:05:42,172
Show me.

80
00:05:42,282 --> 00:05:45,782
I called the best doctor,
so it should be fine.

81
00:05:45,802 --> 00:05:49,442
You get me, right?
I didn't want to hurt you.

82
00:05:49,762 --> 00:05:51,512
I was caught in the middle myself.

83
00:05:53,822 --> 00:05:54,982
I understand.

84
00:05:58,172 --> 00:05:59,592
Eat.

85
00:05:59,632 --> 00:06:01,462
Eat, Junhyun.

86
00:06:01,502 --> 00:06:03,252
- Thank you for the food.
- Yeah.

87
00:06:06,452 --> 00:06:08,442
You like this, right?
Have it as well.

88
00:06:09,672 --> 00:06:10,922
Help yourselves.

89
00:06:11,342 --> 00:06:14,152
Donghyun, do you want to quit?

90
00:06:15,092 --> 00:06:17,002
I wish I could let you.

91
00:06:17,052 --> 00:06:20,302
You're too good to be stuck here, right?

92
00:06:20,552 --> 00:06:21,762
Remember.

93
00:06:22,092 --> 00:06:26,752
No matter what,
whatever it takes,

94
00:06:27,052 --> 00:06:30,192
you have to get it back.
Got it?

95
00:06:35,002 --> 00:06:37,612
- Over here.
- Yes.

96
00:07:27,832 --> 00:07:30,952
The heating system's
water pump has burst.

97
00:07:31,212 --> 00:07:35,962
What's worse, there's leakage too.
A crack in the water pipes.

98
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:39,572
This house is very old
so it'll take a lot to repair.

99
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:44,042
Even if the leakage is sealed, the
heating system and the pipes need change.

100
00:07:44,722 --> 00:07:49,662
It'll cost about 2 million won.
Somewhere around there.

101
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:55,212
- Is it really necessary?
- Well, I guess not.

102
00:07:55,252 --> 00:07:58,422
As long as you don't mind washing
in cold, rusty water.

103
00:08:28,682 --> 00:08:31,172
483,000 won...

104
00:08:35,092 --> 00:08:39,002
Everyone buys groceries online,
not offline.

105
00:08:39,062 --> 00:08:40,682
Even if we promote like this,

106
00:08:40,702 --> 00:08:45,352
people will still buy through apps
like Market Kurly or Oaris.

107
00:08:45,382 --> 00:08:48,552
I personally still prefer
buying ingredients in person.

108
00:08:48,592 --> 00:08:51,172
Well, youngsters these days
are different.

109
00:08:51,462 --> 00:08:53,172
It's the age of
non-face-to-face.

110
00:08:53,212 --> 00:08:55,302
Dating, business,
time with friends...

111
00:08:55,342 --> 00:08:59,172
It's all done on the phone.
What makes groceries different?

112
00:09:02,632 --> 00:09:03,922
Eunsoo!

113
00:09:04,212 --> 00:09:07,302
Oh...
Hi, there.

114
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:10,052
- Long time no see.
- Yeah.

115
00:09:10,632 --> 00:09:12,172
Tell me about it.

116
00:09:12,172 --> 00:09:15,682
He's been busier than a professor
as a mid-level manager!

117
00:09:16,552 --> 00:09:18,052
I'm a department head.

118
00:09:19,052 --> 00:09:20,562
Whatever, same thing.

119
00:09:20,632 --> 00:09:23,212
Why do they send you
on so many business trips?

120
00:09:24,752 --> 00:09:27,592
Why'd you put that in?
It's not organic.

121
00:09:31,882 --> 00:09:34,182
And about that...

122
00:09:34,272 --> 00:09:39,922
This place barely has any organic produce.
Make a separate section for it.

123
00:09:39,982 --> 00:09:43,302
I usually go to the organic store
by the station.

124
00:09:43,342 --> 00:09:46,172
I only come here because of you.

125
00:09:46,942 --> 00:09:48,712
- I'll suggest it.
- Great.

126
00:09:48,752 --> 00:09:51,172
I knew you'd understand me.

127
00:09:51,822 --> 00:09:53,112
I'll leave you to it then.

128
00:09:57,932 --> 00:09:59,092
Sorry about that.

00:10:35,795 --> 00:10:37,405
Partnership contract.

133
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,425
This contract is between
James and Kang Eunsoo...

134
00:10:41,095 --> 00:10:42,595
KANG HWIRIM

135
00:10:42,885 --> 00:10:46,065
...for the purpose of supplying
and selling meth...

136
00:10:46,095 --> 00:10:46,815
Yeah.

137
00:10:46,825 --> 00:10:49,675
We're going to my villa this weekend.
Wanna come?

138
00:10:50,675 --> 00:10:51,465
Why not?

139
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:53,885
I don't invite just
anyone to my villa.

140
00:10:54,885 --> 00:10:56,005
You'll bring it, right?

141
00:10:57,015 --> 00:11:00,385
- The new one from Saturday.
- Maybe.

142
00:11:00,615 --> 00:11:02,795
I'll pay you well, so bring plenty.

143
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:02,805
I'll pay you well, so bring plenty.
Don't embarrass me
in front of my friends.

144
00:11:02,805 --> 00:11:04,595
Don't embarrass me
in front of my friends.

145
00:11:05,255 --> 00:11:06,765
I never forget stuff like that.

146
00:11:08,345 --> 00:11:11,765
One. Kang Eunsoo agrees
to supply meth to James...

147
00:11:17,515 --> 00:11:21,075
- Your grandfather's here, focus.
- Sorry, it was work.

148
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,325
Oh? Father!

149
00:11:25,175 --> 00:11:27,015
Father! Father!

150
00:11:28,175 --> 00:11:30,095
The kids are so beautiful.

151
00:11:40,265 --> 00:11:42,095
You did so well.

152
00:11:42,095 --> 00:11:43,725
Well done!

153
00:11:49,055 --> 00:11:53,215
Three. If Kang Eunsoo
fails to uphold Section 2

154
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:56,645
or is responsible for
causing damage to James,

155
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,805
Kang Eunsoo must compensate.

156
00:11:59,095 --> 00:12:01,425
Four. If any problem arises

157
00:12:01,475 --> 00:12:05,765
due to the source of the product,
Kang Eunsoo must take full responsibility.

158
00:12:30,355 --> 00:12:31,895
You're leaving now?

159
00:12:33,225 --> 00:12:34,635
Poor thing.

160
00:12:36,925 --> 00:12:39,495
I told you to wait
until the heating's fixed.

161
00:12:39,685 --> 00:12:42,505
Why would you wash your hair
with cold water?

162
00:12:42,515 --> 00:12:44,835
How can I not?
Impossible.

163
00:12:47,095 --> 00:12:48,095
Oh my!

164
00:12:49,425 --> 00:12:52,475
Hey, wait a second.
Stay here.

165
00:13:00,455 --> 00:13:03,385
Where's that black padded jacket
from last year?

166
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:05,955
Gosh...

167
00:13:19,605 --> 00:13:21,855
I wore this in primary school.

168
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:26,105
It still fits because
it was oversized. It's pretty.

169
00:13:26,135 --> 00:13:29,795
This is goose down, okay?
Real feathers.

170
00:13:31,095 --> 00:13:33,305
Better than freezing, right?

171
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:36,475
I'll get the boiler fixed quickly.

172
00:13:37,095 --> 00:13:40,175
I love you, honey.
Come straight home after school.

173
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:44,095
Love you too.
I'll be off then.

174
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,175
Mrs. Kang Eunsoo,
due to your continued missed payments

175
00:14:09,225 --> 00:14:12,095
and avoidance of contact,
legal action will be taken.

176
00:14:16,675 --> 00:14:17,385
ART CLASS TUTOR

177
00:14:20,385 --> 00:14:23,135
The number you have dialed
is switched off.

178
00:14:48,005 --> 00:14:49,385
Are you kidding me?

179
00:14:50,345 --> 00:14:53,215
- Can you tell who's who?
- Sorry, sir.

180
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:56,425
What about the VIP floor?

181
00:14:56,475 --> 00:14:59,375
The footage got wiped,
and we're still recovering it.

182
00:14:59,415 --> 00:15:01,725
- Show the day before.
- The entire month got erased.

183
00:15:01,765 --> 00:15:03,635
I'll report it
when it's all recovered.

184
00:15:04,765 --> 00:15:06,055
Hey, play it.

185
00:15:06,095 --> 00:15:07,055
Take a look at this.

186
00:15:11,965 --> 00:15:14,955
That day at Medusa,
there was an influencer's birthday party.

187
00:15:14,985 --> 00:15:18,835
That girl Mimi - her family runs
a foreign company,

188
00:15:18,855 --> 00:15:21,825
and has her own fashion brand.
She's an Instagram celebrity.

189
00:15:21,905 --> 00:15:23,095
Just get to the point.

190
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:27,295
As you can see, the birthday party
was open to the public,

191
00:15:27,295 --> 00:15:29,305
and took place on the main stage
of basement 2.

192
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:33,325
However, she hung out separately
with her friends on the VIP floor above.

193
00:15:33,425 --> 00:15:36,885
So basically, she spent around
two hours on the VIP floor

194
00:15:36,925 --> 00:15:39,095
before she came down to dance.

195
00:15:40,155 --> 00:15:42,495
I guess those two hours
were the highlight.

196
00:15:43,265 --> 00:15:45,695
I believe so,
but we have no proof.

197
00:15:45,715 --> 00:15:48,045
We haven't ID'd the others yet,
but over there...

198
00:15:48,055 --> 00:15:51,175
That's the grandson of
TwoN Group's Chairman, Kang Goonam.

199
00:15:51,225 --> 00:15:57,135
His name is Kang Hwirim,
either a boyfriend or sponsor of Mimi.

200
00:15:57,175 --> 00:15:58,585
Pause.

201
00:15:58,895 --> 00:16:01,085
Who's that? The tall guy.

202
00:16:01,155 --> 00:16:03,135
No idea.
Maybe a club official?

203
00:16:03,175 --> 00:16:04,715
He only appeared here.

204
00:16:09,225 --> 00:16:10,305
Hmm...

205
00:16:18,555 --> 00:16:20,135
I don't think so.

206
00:16:24,475 --> 00:16:28,055
You took your whole crew
and filmed a movie.

207
00:16:28,095 --> 00:16:31,255
But you let the drug dealer
and buyers get away.

208
00:16:31,315 --> 00:16:34,095
And the only guy you caught
is refusing to testify.

209
00:16:34,475 --> 00:16:36,555
Did I get the situation right?

210
00:16:38,805 --> 00:16:40,095
Hey!

211
00:16:40,935 --> 00:16:42,125
What's wrong with you?

212
00:16:42,705 --> 00:16:44,845
You're our best guy.
What's going on?

213
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:56,595
The Organized Crime Division
has taken an interest.

214
00:16:56,795 --> 00:16:57,755
What?

215
00:16:57,805 --> 00:17:00,305
Taegu, you have to produce results.

216
00:17:00,345 --> 00:17:04,725
If this collapses, your chances
of promotion will become zero.

217
00:17:14,175 --> 00:17:15,385
Hey!

218
00:17:15,425 --> 00:17:18,815
It's twice a month.
Twice, you hear?

219
00:17:19,135 --> 00:17:21,515
You're violating visitation rights.

220
00:17:21,635 --> 00:17:23,175
You want your custody revoked?

221
00:17:23,315 --> 00:17:25,385
Don't use Mingyo as an excuse!

222
00:17:25,425 --> 00:17:30,675
What did you say to him
to make him refuse to see me?

223
00:17:31,415 --> 00:17:33,005
Hey... Hey!

224
00:17:45,295 --> 00:17:46,875
Was that your wife?

225
00:17:49,315 --> 00:17:52,055
We divorced ages ago.
She's not my wife.

226
00:17:53,175 --> 00:17:56,285
Don't worry, we're keeping
the club under surveillance.

227
00:17:56,415 --> 00:18:00,015
Are you dumb?
All the clubs know about our raid.

228
00:18:00,055 --> 00:18:03,695
They'll be hiding for months,
and won't even violate traffic laws.

229
00:18:07,665 --> 00:18:10,495
Where did you say
Kim Minwoo is right now?

230
00:18:11,095 --> 00:18:13,135
HAPPINESS HOSPITAL

231
00:18:15,215 --> 00:18:17,375
It's been days.

232
00:18:17,415 --> 00:18:20,515
He's got a fever and
was in pain all night.

233
00:18:21,265 --> 00:18:24,235
Do something.
Give him painkillers at least.

234
00:18:24,235 --> 00:18:24,245
Do something.
Give him painkillers at least.
We've already given the maximum.
Let's wait and see...

235
00:18:24,245 --> 00:18:26,755
We've already given the maximum.
Let's wait and see...

236
00:18:26,755 --> 00:18:29,425
How long must we wait?
He's about to die!

237
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:32,095
You're making it worse.
Just let me be.

238
00:18:32,095 --> 00:18:33,125
Still...

239
00:18:45,805 --> 00:18:50,095
Looking at the patient's condition,
continuing chemo is out of the question.

240
00:18:51,425 --> 00:18:53,015
Then what else can we do?

241
00:18:53,025 --> 00:18:55,595
Switching to immunotherapy
would be better.

242
00:19:13,325 --> 00:19:15,095
No, it's okay.

243
00:19:15,995 --> 00:19:18,695
- Are you feeling better now?
- Yes.

244
00:19:23,055 --> 00:19:25,025
Shouldn't you be at work?
How did you get here?

245
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,975
I just popped in during lunch.

246
00:19:28,975 --> 00:19:31,225
Eunsoo, take this.

247
00:19:34,505 --> 00:19:35,785
What is this?

248
00:19:35,795 --> 00:19:39,475
You love my anchovies.
It's for you.

249
00:19:39,975 --> 00:19:41,095
Thanks.

250
00:19:43,055 --> 00:19:45,475
It felt empty after you left.

251
00:19:46,465 --> 00:19:50,165
But with Dojin also gone,
work's not fun at all.

252
00:19:50,925 --> 00:19:53,575
I didn't quit.
I got fired.

253
00:19:56,225 --> 00:19:57,995
Are you alright?
How do you feel?

254
00:19:58,035 --> 00:20:01,315
I feel a bit better.
Less nauseous.

255
00:20:01,845 --> 00:20:05,265
Really?
Hey, it's because I came.

256
00:20:07,135 --> 00:20:09,425
You know, right?
The Yeoju effect.

257
00:20:10,005 --> 00:20:11,845
They say laughing is the best.

258
00:20:11,865 --> 00:20:13,805
Call me anytime, boss.

259
00:20:14,095 --> 00:20:15,975
Yeah, I think it's working.

260
00:20:24,465 --> 00:20:27,975
I bought it at the clinic my mom goes to.
For you and Sua.

261
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:32,265
Thanks for getting one
for Sua too.

262
00:20:32,305 --> 00:20:35,515
You first!
Take care of yourself first.

263
00:20:35,555 --> 00:20:39,175
Dojin and Sua have you.
But who's taking care of you?

264
00:20:39,225 --> 00:20:43,345
You have to eat well
and pace yourself carefully.

265
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,825
Don't suddenly snap
and do something reckless.

266
00:20:48,475 --> 00:20:49,885
What would I do?

267
00:20:51,555 --> 00:20:53,825
People like you are the scariest.

268
00:20:54,195 --> 00:20:55,675
Don't you remember school?

269
00:20:55,695 --> 00:20:58,435
You threw flip-flops at that teacher
in front of everyone.

270
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:01,345
That was...

271
00:21:02,285 --> 00:21:08,095
I get it. He harassed us
whenever he could for being poor.

272
00:21:13,785 --> 00:21:15,095
Hey, Kang Eunsoo!

273
00:21:15,095 --> 00:21:19,095
You went from being called
the best student to a psycho.

274
00:21:19,415 --> 00:21:21,595
Don't mess with
the psycho Eunsoo!

275
00:21:25,095 --> 00:21:26,635
I remember it like yesterday.

276
00:21:27,385 --> 00:21:28,885
Baek Yeoju,
get back to your seat.

277
00:21:29,145 --> 00:21:30,235
Sit down, chop-chop.

278
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,595
You were really different.

279
00:21:36,415 --> 00:21:41,145
Our backgrounds were similar,
but you were confident, as if...

280
00:21:41,835 --> 00:21:43,245
As if you had everything.

281
00:21:44,295 --> 00:21:46,285
Maybe that's why
we're still so different.

282
00:21:50,095 --> 00:21:53,095
Anyway, don't let your stress pile up.

283
00:21:53,095 --> 00:21:57,725
If it piles up too much,
you won't be able to handle it.

284
00:22:00,265 --> 00:22:05,055
So don't bottle it up.
Let it out once in a while.

285
00:22:05,475 --> 00:22:09,595
Either to me or to your husband.

286
00:22:15,115 --> 00:22:15,925
Yeoju.

287
00:22:19,675 --> 00:22:21,345
Well, actually...

288
00:22:23,765 --> 00:22:24,885
What I mean is...

289
00:22:33,095 --> 00:22:36,555
I'll pay you back,
no matter what.

290
00:22:37,095 --> 00:22:40,465
Hey, it's fine.
It wasn't that much.

291
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:46,175
Pay me back by getting
Dojin completely healed.

292
00:23:20,925 --> 00:23:23,395
How's the food?
Does it suit your taste?

293
00:23:23,425 --> 00:23:27,505
Talk to my lawyer.
I've got nothing to say.

294
00:23:30,045 --> 00:23:32,955
Kim Minwoo, born 1993.

295
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:36,955
Father's name, Kim Seochil.
Former CEO of Hansu Heavy Industries.

296
00:23:36,975 --> 00:23:41,885
Once owned a few buildings in Gwangnam,
but the business went bankrupt.

297
00:23:41,945 --> 00:23:44,365
Everything gets sold
and he's been broke for a while.

298
00:23:44,385 --> 00:23:49,665
You're father is currently
an acting-executive of a bar in Daegu,

299
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:53,985
while his son continues
to enjoy chaebol cosplay.

300
00:23:55,265 --> 00:23:56,425
Who the hell are you?

301
00:23:56,475 --> 00:24:01,325
You paid a 200 million won deposit
to get into Medusa's VIP floor.

302
00:24:02,695 --> 00:24:04,185
Loan shark?

303
00:24:05,095 --> 00:24:10,635
It's obvious how you're
affording this private room.

304
00:24:11,465 --> 00:24:13,445
You'd rather die
than bend your pride.

305
00:24:13,475 --> 00:24:15,655
Class lasts forever, is that it?

306
00:24:18,985 --> 00:24:21,305
Are you a stalker?
Isn't this illegal?

307
00:24:21,345 --> 00:24:26,445
Does your loan shark
know that you're completely broke?

308
00:24:28,055 --> 00:24:29,785
I might as well tell them.

309
00:24:39,525 --> 00:24:41,095
I have no interest in you.

310
00:24:42,235 --> 00:24:44,775
All I need to know is the guy

311
00:24:46,465 --> 00:24:47,875
who brought the drugs.

312
00:24:49,995 --> 00:24:57,035
But if you keep your mouth shut
and refuse to cooperate like this,

313
00:24:59,095 --> 00:25:01,265
then I might start taking
an interest in other things.

314
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:06,505
What will it be?

315
00:25:16,925 --> 00:25:18,975
Do you really want my attention?

316
00:25:26,885 --> 00:25:30,805
James... James...

317
00:25:31,515 --> 00:25:33,855
How did you find all that out?

318
00:25:33,855 --> 00:25:38,175
State authority exists
for times like these.

319
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:41,455
What time did you say
Medusa opens?

320
00:25:41,615 --> 00:25:46,055
It opens on Fridays and Saturdays
from 9 pm to 10 am.

321
00:25:46,065 --> 00:25:48,805
- Call and double-check.
- Yes, sir.

322
00:26:17,515 --> 00:26:21,155
Sua, your cold seems bad.
Want to leave early?

323
00:26:21,425 --> 00:26:23,345
No! I'm fine.

324
00:26:23,635 --> 00:26:26,885
She'll skip other classes,
but never art.

325
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:26,885
She'll skip other classes,
but never art.
- Right, Sua?
- I just like this class.

326
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:29,865
- Right, Sua?
- I just like this class.

327
00:26:30,765 --> 00:26:32,095
So you don't like me?

328
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:35,975
No, I did not mean it like that.

329
00:26:36,225 --> 00:26:37,755
Then why's your face red?

330
00:26:37,775 --> 00:26:40,055
- What are you talking about?
- It's red!

331
00:26:43,885 --> 00:26:47,425
- Wipe your nose.
- Thanks.

332
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:51,385
Not there.

333
00:26:53,865 --> 00:26:55,335
- Done.
- Done?

334
00:26:56,455 --> 00:26:58,025
- Mr. Lee!
- Yes?

335
00:26:58,035 --> 00:26:59,845
Want to see Sua's sketchbook?

336
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:01,985
- There are drawings of...
- Yoojung, stop.

337
00:27:01,985 --> 00:27:01,985
- There are drawings of...
- Yoojung, stop.
- Hey, no!
- Just once!

338
00:27:01,985 --> 00:27:03,385
- Hey, no!
- Just once!

339
00:27:03,425 --> 00:27:06,555
No, don't. I'm serious!

340
00:27:06,595 --> 00:27:09,515
Sua, there's a hole in your jacket.

341
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:12,095
- Where?
- Here.

342
00:27:13,935 --> 00:27:17,075
Oh, she's right.
Sua, there's a hole in your sleeve.

343
00:27:22,005 --> 00:27:23,725
Where? I don't see it.

344
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:27,395
Look, on the left sleeve.
There's a big hole...

345
00:27:33,225 --> 00:27:34,675
Yoojung, go take your seat.

347
00:28:29,025 --> 00:28:30,065
Have a good day.

348
00:28:31,965 --> 00:28:35,925
- Eunsoo.
- Hey, going to give a lecture?

349
00:28:35,925 --> 00:28:37,435
Yeah, afternoon lecture.

350
00:28:37,595 --> 00:28:41,745
- Oh, take this.
- What is it?

351
00:28:41,755 --> 00:28:45,305
Get your girl a decent winter coat.

353
00:28:49,725 --> 00:28:51,425
Good grief...

354
00:28:53,095 --> 00:28:55,305
Wait!
Stop for a second!

355
00:29:36,305 --> 00:29:38,045
Damn it!

356
00:29:54,515 --> 00:29:56,425
You didn't have to carry it.

357
00:29:56,935 --> 00:29:59,805
You even gave me a lift.
Thank you.

358
00:29:59,845 --> 00:30:03,095
It's fine, I was on my way
to make a delivery.

359
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:08,095
- Where should I put this?
- Oh, over there. On top.

360
00:30:08,095 --> 00:30:09,675
Thank you.

361
00:30:10,425 --> 00:30:11,805
- Thank you.
- No problem.

362
00:30:11,815 --> 00:30:15,885
- Want some juice?
- No, water's fine.

363
00:30:17,555 --> 00:30:18,845
Just a moment.

364
00:30:27,435 --> 00:30:28,435
Thank you.

365
00:30:36,805 --> 00:30:39,925
Um, could I wash my hands?

366
00:30:39,975 --> 00:30:42,265
Just wash here.
Come.

367
00:30:47,225 --> 00:30:48,335
Oh my!

368
00:30:52,355 --> 00:30:54,555
As you can see,
the house is a bit old.

369
00:30:56,345 --> 00:31:00,515
Actually, we're replacing
the pipes tomorrow.

370
00:31:01,095 --> 00:31:02,345
Oh, I see.

371
00:31:03,475 --> 00:31:06,555
Sorry your hand got dirtier.

372
00:31:07,675 --> 00:31:11,875
- Want to rinse it with this water?
- No.

373
00:31:11,915 --> 00:31:14,765
Actually, if you don't mind...

374
00:31:51,305 --> 00:31:52,635
You know how to do that?

375
00:31:52,675 --> 00:31:56,485
Yeah, I used to do
pipe-cleaning as part-time.

376
00:31:56,525 --> 00:31:58,835
I learned it then.

377
00:31:58,855 --> 00:32:02,345
By the way, I heard you got
into Seonjoong Construction.

378
00:32:03,635 --> 00:32:07,095
Congrats!
That's a big company, right?

379
00:32:07,095 --> 00:32:10,595
Well, it's not finalized yet.

380
00:32:10,635 --> 00:32:13,015
There's a third interview left.

381
00:32:13,245 --> 00:32:15,555
But it's my first time making it this far.

382
00:32:15,595 --> 00:32:20,345
- So you'll soon switch jobs?
- Yeah, probably.

383
00:32:21,685 --> 00:32:23,945
I'll have to quit
everything I used to do.

384
00:32:24,775 --> 00:32:26,215
That doesn't sound easy.

385
00:32:26,865 --> 00:32:31,515
The boss is really fond of you.
You're quiet and good at the job.

386
00:32:31,925 --> 00:32:33,675
She won't let you go easily.

387
00:32:50,175 --> 00:32:52,095
Don't mind me.

388
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:57,345
No, it's fine.
It's all clean now.

389
00:32:58,265 --> 00:33:02,095
It's temporary, so rusty water
might flow out again.

390
00:33:02,555 --> 00:33:05,385
Still, it should be fine for a while.

391
00:33:05,405 --> 00:33:07,795
How can I repay you?

392
00:33:07,835 --> 00:33:12,465
How about some side dishes?
You live with a younger sibling, right?

393
00:33:12,905 --> 00:33:16,385
No, really.
You don't have to.

394
00:33:19,585 --> 00:33:22,805
You can't eat out every day.

395
00:33:22,845 --> 00:33:25,795
You need to eat well
before your interview.

396
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:25,805
You need to eat well
before your interview.
I'll pack you some soup too.
Do you like pollock soup?

397
00:33:25,805 --> 00:33:29,035
I'll pack you some soup too.
Do you like pollock soup?

398
00:33:30,095 --> 00:33:34,375
Yes, I do. Thank you.

399
00:33:37,305 --> 00:33:44,185
Listen, could you drop me off
at the subway station on your way?

400
00:33:44,185 --> 00:33:45,485
Ah, sure.

401
00:33:55,345 --> 00:33:57,425
The number you have dialed
is switched off...

DELIVERY MAN

403
00:34:16,485 --> 00:34:17,805
Sua.

404
00:34:18,565 --> 00:34:21,025
- Heading home?
- Yes.

405
00:34:27,145 --> 00:34:28,665
Welcome.

406
00:34:32,265 --> 00:34:36,305
Could you pick a padded jacket
for my girl at this price?

407
00:34:47,325 --> 00:34:49,095
You really didn't have to
give me a ride.

408
00:34:51,185 --> 00:34:53,265
I'm going in the same direction anyway.

409
00:35:12,095 --> 00:35:13,425
You got a feather there.

410
00:35:30,725 --> 00:35:33,095
- How are things going?
- Pardon?

411
00:35:33,095 --> 00:35:36,885
I heard your father's sick.
Cancer, right?

412
00:35:39,475 --> 00:35:40,975
How did you know?

413
00:35:42,425 --> 00:35:45,095
I just heard the girls talking.

414
00:35:46,765 --> 00:35:48,135
Am I being too nosy?

415
00:35:49,785 --> 00:35:52,295
My homeroom teacher
and friends all know.

416
00:35:52,985 --> 00:35:54,055
It's pancreatic cancer.

417
00:35:54,095 --> 00:35:57,755
Sorry, I shouldn't have asked.

418
00:35:59,475 --> 00:36:00,725
It must be hard for you.

419
00:36:02,095 --> 00:36:04,975
No, not as much as my mom.

420
00:36:05,425 --> 00:36:08,245
Caring for Dad, working,
and looking after me too.

421
00:36:08,925 --> 00:36:10,765
She never shows it though.

422
00:36:11,475 --> 00:36:13,665
She didn't even cry
when Dad got cancer.

423
00:36:14,345 --> 00:36:17,925
Actually, I've never seen her cry.

424
00:36:18,935 --> 00:36:20,865
Maybe she cries alone.

425
00:36:20,885 --> 00:36:22,475
That's even lonelier.

426
00:36:22,645 --> 00:36:25,015
Crying is worse
when you're alone.

427
00:36:26,845 --> 00:36:28,555
Are all grown-ups like that?

428
00:36:29,515 --> 00:36:31,675
Are you like that too?
Do you cry alone?

429
00:36:40,025 --> 00:36:42,095
Mr. Lee, it's this way.

430
00:36:42,135 --> 00:36:43,095
Yeah.

431
00:36:54,695 --> 00:36:56,095
Thank you.

432
00:36:57,915 --> 00:36:58,875
Is that...

433
00:37:00,265 --> 00:37:03,595
Thanks for the ride, Mr. Lee.
You made my day.

434
00:37:03,635 --> 00:37:05,315
Don't worry about it.

435
00:37:05,385 --> 00:37:06,345
God!

436
00:37:11,865 --> 00:37:13,695
Why are you getting out of his car?

437
00:37:13,795 --> 00:37:15,095
What do you mean?

438
00:37:15,135 --> 00:37:17,475
He's my art tutor, remember?

439
00:37:17,515 --> 00:37:19,975
Hello, ma'am.
Nice to see you again.

440
00:37:20,265 --> 00:37:22,765
He gave me a ride
because I caught a cold.

441
00:37:23,515 --> 00:37:27,095
Thanks, but please
don't do this again.

442
00:37:27,695 --> 00:37:29,025
Let's go inside, hurry.

443
00:37:29,695 --> 00:37:31,155
See you at school!

444
00:37:32,385 --> 00:37:33,345
Bye.

445
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,095
32 HAENGBOK-RO, 55

446
00:37:50,765 --> 00:37:53,225
DESIGNATED REDEVELOPMENT ZONE

447
00:37:55,135 --> 00:37:57,255
Where did you lose
the drug bag again?

448
00:37:57,345 --> 00:37:59,845
Haengbok-dong redevelopment zone.

449
00:38:21,955 --> 00:38:23,845
Yeah, I checked the samples.

450
00:38:24,895 --> 00:38:27,095
I think we found your stash.

451
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:30,930
What's this?

452
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,120
Try it on.

453
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:42,890
How is it? Do I look good?

454
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:46,220
Of course.
You look great.

455
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,640
So pretty.

456
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,860
Jinhee has one too.
Mine's prettier though.

457
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:53,390
I'm surprised.
You actually bought this?

458
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:56,140
Wasn't it expensive?

459
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:02,390
No, it was on sale.
Didn't cost much.

460
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,390
That's a relief.

461
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:19,390
Sua, don't hop into strangers' cars.

462
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:22,390
How is my art tutor a stranger?

463
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:27,220
He's still an adult man.
You're a minor.

464
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,890
He's not a criminal.
Don't worry.

465
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:38,580
Do you want to go
to an art academy instead?

466
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,140
Extracurricular art class is good.

467
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:44,390
But an art academy
will prep you better for Uni.

468
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,890
Art class is only three times a week.

469
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:49,020
Besides...

470
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,210
Why are you looking like that?

471
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,390
What about the fee?

472
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,640
Huh?

473
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:03,160
An art academy costs three times more.
Can we afford money?

474
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,520
What's this?

475
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:55,140
Buy her some nice winter clothes.

476
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:56,390
Do you have the money?

477
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:52,340
Gosh, unbelievable.

478
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:55,520
You looked at me like
I was a germ.

479
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:59,890
Sorry, I was just surprised earlier.

480
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:02,390
I'm tired,
just get to the point.

481
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,930
When will you start selling again?

482
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:10,520
You said you needed more, right?

483
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,830
But I haven't heard from you.

484
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:15,520
When are you selling again?

485
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:18,770
Didn't I tell you?

486
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:21,500
We can't operate at Medusa for now.

487
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,790
That district is crawling with cops.

488
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:27,020
Really?
For how long?

489
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,000
Could be a month.
Maybe two.

490
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:32,890
Then what am I supposed to do?

491
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:34,540
Why are you asking me?

492
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:37,240
It was your role to promote
and bring in customers.

493
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:39,140
We've got ten kilos of product.
If we can't sell,

494
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,520
what's the point of this partnership?

495
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,140
Why aren't you working?
Isn't this a breach of contract?

496
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:52,390
Mrs. Kang, did you say ten kilos?
Not one?

497
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:55,640
I knew something was wrong.

498
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:59,020
Turns out it was trouble after all, eh?

499
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:06,390
What do you mean by that?
What trouble?

500
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:15,390
Are we really giving James
ten percent?

501
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,520
Will you actually pay him
for bringing the stuff?

502
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,390
Ten percent is hundreds of millions.

503
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,020
Junhyun, aren't you curious?

504
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:24,260
About what?

505
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,390
What he looks like.

506
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:29,270
It's been two years,
yet we still don't know his face.

507
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:49,890
Aren't you coming in?
Then wait there.

508
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:35,640
PHANTOM
KANG EUNSOO

509
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:39,390
Explain this.

510
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:42,890
How is your stuff identical
to Phantom's new drug?

511
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:46,250
Head's up, lady.

512
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:49,520
Phantom is my supplier.

513
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,890
The drugs you stole
included my shipment too.

514
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,630
Honestly, I was surprised.

515
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:02,390
How does a civilian steal from pros?

516
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:04,340
And for what?

517
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,960
You're not the only one
who'll get screwed here!

518
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:09,390
Even the cops are after this stuff!

519
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:11,760
Are you trying to ruin my life?

520
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:16,400
I didn't mean any harm.

521
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:19,520
Do you know
how I survived in this industry?

522
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:23,040
I never take risks.

523
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:25,140
Not for customers nor myself.

524
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:27,510
It's easy to get carried away
in this line of work.

525
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:29,250
By drugs or money.

526
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:30,390
And then you get careless.

527
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:32,560
You start spilling info
and leaving traces.

528
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,190
That's how you get caught.
Or killed.

529
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,640
But me?
I never get carried away.

530
00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:42,410
Because I mustn't.
I can't afford to!

531
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:46,390
Then you came along
and broke the rules, you hear?

532
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:53,650
Wait, who are you calling?

533
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:57,140
Who else? The owner of the drugs.
I'm not taking the fall.

534
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:01,290
No, please. Have mercy...

535
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:02,640
Are you crazy?

536
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:06,020
What?

537
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:09,640
Hello?

538
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,110
What the hell?

539
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:34,390
Hey, do you really want to die?

540
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:43,390
Please, just give me
one more chance!

541
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:45,890
I'll do anything.

542
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:49,640
I'll do whatever you say.

543
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:55,070
Please, for my family's sake.
Just this once.

544
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,770
For Sua's sake, I beg you.

545
00:46:57,810 --> 00:46:59,390
Please.

546
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:03,510
You'll really do anything?

547
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,700
Yes, anything.

548
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:08,020
Then hand everything over.

549
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:10,270
The whole stolen bag.

550
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:20,000
Business is already down
because of police raids.

551
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,190
Are you really going to do this?

552
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:25,520
Then just bring me James.

553
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,580
He's the biggest shot
around here, right?

554
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:31,020
He buys new cars all the time,
and deals only with VIPs.

555
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:32,390
Let me meet him.

556
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:35,580
In a way, I'm a VIP too.

557
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,830
I don't know such a person!

558
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:39,100
You're so frustrating.

559
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:43,390
Check the employment list.
There's no James in there!

560
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:53,770
If you do that,
I'll at least spare your life.

561
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:59,120
But without that drug,
our family will...

562
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:00,390
Damn it!

563
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:04,770
You said it's none
of my business, remember?

564
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:25,250
Fuck, I forgot the number...

565
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:44,890
3, 2...

566
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:48,140
There's another way to sell it.

567
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,640
What?

568
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:57,390
People like you,
the younger generation.

569
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:59,290
Friends, romance, money...

570
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,150
Everyone does everything

571
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:02,770
using their phones.

572
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:07,270
Can't we sell drugs that way too?

573
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:15,390
If cutting risk is your rule,

574
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:17,080
online is the safest.

575
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:19,740
There are too many variables
with trades like this.

576
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,520
Remember Medusa?

577
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,770
That pussy...

578
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:28,550
When that man screwed up.
If I hadn't switched the room signs,

579
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:31,080
you and your customers
would've been arrested.

580
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:33,900
Don't get full of yourself.

581
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:35,390
Do you think I'm that sloppy?

582
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:38,390
You would've left a trace
or spilled some info.

583
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:43,390
I'll handle customer ops and delivery.

584
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:45,390
Everything will be
non-face-to-face.

585
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:50,390
Customers won't know who we are.
Certainly not you.

586
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:54,130
Think about it.
The police are watching the clubs.

587
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:54,140
Think about it.
The police are watching the clubs.
You said so yourself
that we need to find a new venue.

588
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:57,350
You said so yourself
that we need to find a new venue.

589
00:49:57,350 --> 00:49:59,140
It's everywhere.

590
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:02,650
You think I don't know that?

591
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:03,940
Hear me out.

592
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:06,550
When a bank markets itself,
it touts one thing.

593
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:07,420
Interest rates.

594
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:12,260
If people hear your interests
are even 0.001% better,

595
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:14,770
even picky customers will switch.

596
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:18,360
Same for us.
We can sell below the market price.

597
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:20,840
How? Because we don't
have an upfront investment.

598
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,710
High purity at a low price?
Word spreads fast.

599
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:25,340
People will flock from all over.

600
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:27,920
Selling in clubs
won't even be comparable.

601
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:30,120
Ten kilos?
I can sell that quickly.

602
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:32,540
Before the police
or Phantom even notice.

603
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,990
We can earn at least
eight to ten billion won.

604
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:42,840
Why give it up to the Phantom
when we can have it for ourselves?

605
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,820
Because of risks
that haven't even happened?

606
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:17,020
You said Kim Minwoo acted
on his own accord.

607
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:19,390
As for James,
you keep no record?

608
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:22,730
Which is better, boss?

609
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:23,870
A tax audit?

610
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,690
Or maybe...

611
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:33,140
Influencer Mimi,
W-Ent's only daughter Woo Sujin,

612
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:39,580
Sungdae Law Firm's Han Seonjae,
and TwoN Group's Kang Hwirim.

613
00:51:40,590 --> 00:51:43,770
They'll bring in a lot of views, eh?

614
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:48,330
I know they had
a drug party here, okay?

615
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:51,770
What'll it be?
Do you want to shut down?

616
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:58,155
Nice picture.

617
00:52:00,355 --> 00:52:02,355
RESUME

618
00:52:02,355 --> 00:52:05,355
KANG EUNSOO

619
00:52:12,505 --> 00:52:17,485
Your plan will be profitable
with low risk in the long run.

620
00:52:17,965 --> 00:52:18,905
Of course.

621
00:52:18,925 --> 00:52:22,055
But then again,
you missed something.

622
00:52:23,405 --> 00:52:27,735
Value - the product's value.

623
00:52:29,015 --> 00:52:31,595
Making money is important.

624
00:52:31,675 --> 00:52:34,265
But who I make it from
matters more to me.

625
00:52:35,005 --> 00:52:39,085
Do you think my clients
would take just any drugs sold online?

626
00:52:39,385 --> 00:52:43,105
Even luxury goods lose value
when sold in a shabby place.

627
00:52:43,645 --> 00:52:46,485
Please, you must reconsider.

628
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:49,695
I'll do the dirty work, so...

629
00:52:49,695 --> 00:52:52,305
I really hate repeating myself.

630
00:52:52,915 --> 00:52:54,505
You remember our contract, right?

631
00:52:54,675 --> 00:52:58,015
If issues arise due to the source
of the product, who's responsible?

632
00:52:59,665 --> 00:53:02,745
You're the one responsible,
Mrs. Kang Eunsoo.

633
00:53:14,295 --> 00:53:16,625
21,660 won.

634
00:53:16,635 --> 00:53:17,845
Here you go.

635
00:53:23,145 --> 00:53:24,355
Thank you.

636
00:53:43,145 --> 00:53:46,015
It's over.
There's no other way.

637
00:53:50,945 --> 00:53:52,525
What's left for me now is...

638
00:53:55,585 --> 00:53:56,545
Eunsoo.

639
00:53:57,715 --> 00:54:00,555
Wake up.
Did you sort the returned inventory?

640
00:54:29,895 --> 00:54:32,525
Bring me the drug bag
by 6 pm tomorrow.

641
00:54:32,585 --> 00:54:36,315
Then I promise I'll forget
you stole it.

642
00:54:40,065 --> 00:54:43,895
In three hours,
all hope will be gone.

643
00:54:44,745 --> 00:54:51,075
I finally understood how
my husband felt on the roof's edge.

644
00:54:58,165 --> 00:55:04,245
Of what it feels like
to really want to die.

645
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:40,070
Friday, Gwangjin Station,
6:30 pm, bench 5-4.

646
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:07,480
- What are you doing?
- Mom, this man is smelly.

647
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,060
Don't say stuff like that.

648
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:11,900
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

649
00:57:13,610 --> 00:57:16,050
Seriously, he smells like candy.

650
00:57:16,050 --> 00:57:17,870
It must be your own scent.

651
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:38,680
MEDUSA

652
00:57:39,551 --> 00:57:42,171
- Yeah.
- Where are you, James?

653
00:57:42,211 --> 00:57:43,891
- Why?
- Come on.

654
00:57:43,931 --> 00:57:45,761
I haven't seen you lately.

655
00:57:45,801 --> 00:57:48,371
The train is arriving.

656
00:57:48,391 --> 00:57:49,511
What? I can't hear.

657
00:57:49,551 --> 00:57:50,641
I'm busy, call me later.

658
00:57:50,681 --> 00:57:53,861
Hey, don't hang up!

659
00:57:54,741 --> 00:58:01,951
Many customers want you.
They're asking for you.

660
00:58:02,071 --> 00:58:04,231
So where you at, James?

661
00:58:04,281 --> 00:58:07,591
You said to lie low
for a month or two.

662
00:58:10,521 --> 00:58:14,141
Too bad we won't be
seeing each other again.

663
00:58:14,581 --> 00:58:15,841
Adios, bastard.

664
00:58:15,891 --> 00:58:16,731
What?

665
00:58:16,751 --> 00:58:20,001
Hey, James!
Don't hang up!

666
00:58:31,321 --> 00:58:33,201
We got him.
Gwangjin Station!

667
00:59:02,401 --> 00:59:04,911
Our boss won't be happy
with just the drug bag.

668
00:59:05,101 --> 00:59:06,641
He'll want the culprit too.

669
00:59:06,781 --> 00:59:08,511
But James didn't steal it.

670
00:59:09,051 --> 00:59:12,141
So what?
We just need results.

671
00:59:13,421 --> 00:59:16,061
Whatever the case,
he has our bag right now.

672
00:59:16,321 --> 00:59:17,391
Then...

673
00:59:17,791 --> 00:59:18,751
You see,

674
00:59:22,211 --> 00:59:24,171
I never liked that guy.

675
00:59:27,771 --> 00:59:28,981
Even his voice.

676
00:59:50,801 --> 00:59:51,761
Stop right there!

677
00:59:56,081 --> 00:59:57,031
Hey!

678
01:00:11,821 --> 01:00:12,781
Heads up.

679
01:00:28,301 --> 01:00:29,261
Grab him!

680
01:00:49,931 --> 01:00:51,011
Catch that guy!

681
01:01:46,001 --> 01:01:48,841
I'm going to kill you.

682
01:02:16,461 --> 01:02:17,761
Ah, damn it!

683
01:02:20,381 --> 01:02:21,641
What the hell, man!

684
01:02:23,291 --> 01:02:25,621
Fuck.
Hey, punk!

685
01:02:26,381 --> 01:02:28,891
You owe us an apology,
don't you think?

686
01:02:28,931 --> 01:02:30,921
What is he doing?

687
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:37,711
What's wrong with him?

688
01:02:45,341 --> 01:02:46,991
That crazy bitch!

689
01:03:25,261 --> 01:03:26,221
But then again.

690
01:03:28,521 --> 01:03:32,391
A cornered rat will bite even a cat.

691
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:44,731
You know, I just can't
hand you the drugs.

692
01:03:45,671 --> 01:03:48,501
If you don't change your mind,
there's nothing we can do.

693
01:03:49,351 --> 01:03:52,351
Let's just die together, Mr. Lee.

694
01:04:00,041 --> 01:04:01,491
Fuck.

695
01:04:05,101 --> 01:04:06,891
You should at least apologize...

696
01:04:21,511 --> 01:04:24,511
THREE HOURS EARLIER

01:05:55,681 --> 01:05:58,187
WALKING ON THIN ICE

699
01:05:58,419 --> 01:05:59,669
There's nothing wrong with that.

700
01:05:59,679 --> 01:06:01,859
Your pathetic family hardships!

701
01:06:02,229 --> 01:06:04,069
They're very common on the streets.

702
01:06:04,139 --> 01:06:06,309
Watch your tone, little brat.

703
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:07,689
So what now?

704
01:06:08,479 --> 01:06:12,359
Whatever you do,
keep our family out of it.

705
01:06:13,009 --> 01:06:14,199
Mom, what are you doing?

706
01:06:14,259 --> 01:06:16,699
Trying to die with that woman,
like she said.

707
01:06:16,729 --> 01:06:19,439
In one and a half months,
that'll be exactly 200 million won.

708
01:06:19,859 --> 01:06:20,659
It matches our product.

709
01:06:20,659 --> 01:06:22,369
I told you no face-to-face deals!

710
01:06:22,369 --> 01:06:22,379
I told you no face-to-face deals!
I want to make sure
nobody can mess with me again.

711
01:06:22,379 --> 01:06:27,819
I want to make sure
nobody can mess with me again.
