00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,382
[Harmon] <i>Previously
on</i> On Call...

2
00:00:07,383 --> 00:00:10,385
[Bishop] Gangs just ID'd
Delgado's shooter, Eddie Watson.

3
00:00:10,386 --> 00:00:11,553
Street name, Maniac.

4
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:14,597
[Harmon] <i>East Barrio executed one
of their own for killing Delgado.</i>

5
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,641
- Anything's possible.
- What about Maniac?

6
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:17,851
[Bishop] <i>Still in the wind.</i>

7
00:00:17,852 --> 00:00:19,102
[Koy] <i>How's your rookie?</i>

8
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:21,187
He's got potential, but he
needs to pick his battles.

9
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:24,941
- Karma's a bitch, huh?
- I was the best trainee you ever had.

10
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:26,776
Hey, speaking of Harmon, I
gotta ask you a question.

11
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:28,027
We found this.

12
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,362
[Harmon on video] <i>Next
time we show up here,</i>

13
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,156
<i>you're gonna be leaving in
the back of an ambulance.</i>

14
00:00:31,157 --> 00:00:32,241
Diaz, look at me.

15
00:00:34,118 --> 00:00:35,869
Did she make a threat?

16
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,912
[sirens wailing]

17
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:41,000
[tense music playing]

18
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:45,504
Move! Move! Move!

19
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:50,551
Get out of the way! Move!

20
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:53,471
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

21
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,850
[Diaz] Stop! Drop the hatchet!

22
00:01:00,186 --> 00:01:02,021
Come here. Stop!

23
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,065
Diaz, what's your 20?

24
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,152
In the office park, top
level. Eyes on suspect.

25
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:14,365
Move! Move! Out of the way!

26
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,494
Drop the hatchet! Stop!

27
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:21,290
Charlie-94, eyes on suspect
and Diaz. I'm in hot pursuit.

28
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,793
[sirens wailing]

29
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:25,920
- For fuck's sake!
- [tires screech]

30
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,172
Fuck!

31
00:01:32,635 --> 00:01:34,427
Fuck. Stop!

32
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:38,223
[grunting]

33
00:01:38,224 --> 00:01:39,683
I gotcha! Fuck.

34
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:42,520
Fuck.

35
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:01,330
[grunts]

36
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:04,291
Hey! Stop!

37
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,003
Stop! Stop!

38
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,631
There's nowhere to go!

39
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,590
Don't! Stop! Hey!

40
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:15,760
No. No. No, no, no,
no! Don't do it! Stop!

41
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:17,680
Don't, don't, don't.
Don't you fucking do it.

42
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:24,395
- [loud thud]
- [suspect] Fuck! [groaning in pain]

43
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:29,399
Oh, shit.

44
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,155
Oh. [panting]

45
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:46,333
Shit.

46
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,209
Fuck.

47
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,545
[sirens wailing]

48
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:52,798
[suspect whimpers]

49
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:55,758
He's high as fuck.

50
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,844
Tried robbing a
7-Eleven with a hatchet.

51
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,929
Chased him all the way
from 22nd up onto the roof,

52
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,806
then, of course, he
swan-dived off it.

53
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:03,350
How was his form?

54
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:05,978
[Holt] Yo, Diaz.

55
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:12,776
You, uh... drop this?

56
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,196
<i>Mi fucking compa.</i> I owe you.

57
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:19,490
My advice? Leave that
part out of your report.

58
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:21,075
Even though we recovered it?

59
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:24,622
Bro, have you not heard
what they say about Harmon?

60
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,291
Can't trust her.

61
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:30,418
Bullshit.

62
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:33,546
She got a bunch of cops fired,
including Lasman's partner.

63
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:34,673
For, for what?

64
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:36,550
Doing their job.

65
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:39,719
Diaz! With me.

66
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,222
[tense music playing]

67
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,373
You know, this one time, I
was training this big dude,

68
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:12,210
Samoan guy, like six-foot-five,
seemed tough as shit.

69
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:16,215
And his first week he had a
jumper land right in front of him.

70
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,257
That guy literally fainted.

71
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,385
He got a concussion when
he hit the pavement.

72
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:22,512
I had to call in a second
ambulance just for him.

73
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:25,849
And now that guy is
a sergeant with SWAT.

74
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:29,060
Really gives me faith in SWAT.

75
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:32,188
[chuckles] Look, the
point is, it gets better.

76
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,189
Okay?

77
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,359
And that shithead was so cooked he
was gonna take a jump off the roof

78
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,529
no matter what, so
that is not on you.

79
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,284
Can I ask you something?

80
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,121
Mm, depends on what it is.

81
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:51,745
Last night you brought up
my brother being locked up.

82
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,794
You know I had to
do my homework.

83
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,546
Come on. No, no. You see,

84
00:04:56,547 --> 00:04:58,715
I feel like you know
everything about me

85
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:00,217
and I know nothing about you.

86
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:02,720
What do you think
this is? A courtship?

87
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,268
I work. I take care of my dogs.

88
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:11,894
If I'm lucky, I surf.

89
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,148
Rinse, repeat. That's my life.

90
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,901
You never talk about your
time on the job before me.

91
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:21,029
What do you mean? I just
told you about my fainter.

92
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,280
What more do you want from me?

93
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:23,614
Okay, fine. [clears throat]

94
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:25,825
You said you had some
trouble in West, right?

95
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,201
People gunning for you.

96
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,202
Why?

97
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,334
Just old drama. It's nothing
you need to worry about.

98
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:41,425
- You get someone fired?
- Wait.

99
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,009
What?

100
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:45,094
[tires screech]

101
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,055
- Did I get someone fired?
- Uh, forget it.

102
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:48,848
- I shouldn't have asked.
- No. Where the fuck did you hear that?

103
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,935
- Did someone say something to you?
- No. No, I was just wondering. Okay?

104
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,563
- [phone vibrates]
- Fuck.

105
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,441
Jesus.

106
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,485
Hey, Mom. Are you okay?

107
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,403
I can't... No.

108
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:03,696
I don't need to chase her

109
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,656
because she'll turn up
when she needs something.

110
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:08,118
Yeah. I'll call you
later. Love you. Bye.

111
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:13,457
[sighs]

112
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:15,666
Everything okay?

113
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,210
Yeah.

114
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,420
My sister.

115
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,798
You have a sister? She
live in Long Beach?

116
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:23,633
No. LA. She used to be a cop.

117
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:26,010
Don't change the fucking
subject. Where did you hear it?

118
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,554
I told you, okay. I
was just wondering.

119
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:29,972

00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,612
It's not some shit
you just wonder.

125
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:51,369
[Harmon] Here it is.

126
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,621
If our suspect is GOA,
you're taking lead on this.

127
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,039
- Understood?
- Yeah. Copy.

128
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,460
[tense music playing]

129
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:03,132
[body cam beeps]

130
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:16,228
[Harmon] Long Beach PD!

131
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:25,945
- Whoa, let me see your hands!
- No, no, they're gone.

132
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,949
They're gone. We're in here.
Oh, thank God you're here.

133
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:31,868
[Diaz] What happened?

134
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:34,620
- I was upstairs and I...
- My husband was home alone.

135
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:37,081
I came in and I found
him tied up on the floor.

136
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,959
Some guy, he broke in
and hit him on the head.

137
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,836
He must've heard me coming
because when I walked in

138
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:42,753
he ran right past me.

139
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,213
[Diaz] Okay. So you weren't
here when it happened?

140
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,007
Oh, no, no, my husband
was home alone,

141
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:48,467
- but I-I just came in...
- Ma'am, I'd like to hear from him,

142
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,802
if that's okay. Sir?

143
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:50,887
That was about it.

144
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:53,055
I was upstairs in the bedroom
putting some clothes away

145
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,724
and next thing I know, bam.

146
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:57,018
I wake up on the floor and
I hear my wife screaming.

147
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:59,770
Uh, we're gonna need an
ambulance over here at location.

148
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,355
- We've got a male with a head wound.
- Hey, I'm fine.

149
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,441
Really. I don't need
an ambulance. Look.

150
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:06,068
Hon, hon, you
could be concussed.

151
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,279
I said I'm fine.

152
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:11,657
Any idea how he
might've gotten in?

153
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:12,825
Was the door locked?

154
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,870
Uh... Yeah. Yeah. It
was when I got home.

155
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,956
Okay. Take a look around outside. See
if there's another point of entry.

156
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,499
Did you see what he looked like?

157
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,752
Yeah. He was, um...

158
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:25,088
Uh, short, young, uh...

159
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,215
Mexican. I think.

160
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:28,383
What makes you think that?

161
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,761
He looked, um...

162
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,721
He looked swarthy.

163
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:34,389
Swarthy?

164
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:43,898
Hey! Police!

165
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:46,901

front yard of 30027 Toledo.

167
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,160
Hey! Long Beach Police
Department. Come out!

168
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:58,120
- He go in there?
- Yeah, I think so.

169
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:00,601
- What the fuck are you waiting for?
- Don't we need a warrant?

170
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,417
[Harmon] Long Beach Police!

171
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:05,420

00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:12,593
- Don't shoot.
- Whoa! Police!

173
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,637
- Stand up, nice and easy.
- Don't shoot!

174
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:16,347
- [Diaz] Let me see your hands.
- Don't shoot!

175
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,934
- [Harmon] Easy.
- Don't shoot. I don't have anything.

176
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:20,893
- What are you doing?
- Turn around.

177
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,436
What are you doing?
I didn't do anything.

178
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,021
- [Harmon] Then why did you run?
- 'Cause I was scared.

179
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,148
- Yeah, let's go. Come on.
- [suspect] Dude.

180

181
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,362
[Diaz] Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?

182
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:33,740
- [speaking Spanish]
- [Harmon] Dude.

183
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:35,784
Translate.

184
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,163
You two mind coming out here?

185
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,248
[Diaz] Chill.

186
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,292
All right. Don't
do anything stupid.

187
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:45,835
- You need to get your head checked out.
- Don't worry...

188
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:48,713
What if you actually have a
concussion, is what I'm worried about.

189
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:50,089
Oh, oh, that's him.

190
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,507
That's the guy who
was in our house.

191
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,009
- You need to pay me.
- [Diaz speaking Spanish]

192
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,554
- Do you know this kid?
- No, of course not.

193
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:58,640
- He's been DMing me all week.
- He's a liar.

194
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,851
Do you wanna tell us
what really happened?

195
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:05,397
You interrogating me now?
I'm the one who was attacked.

196
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:09,860
Okay. Well, he has
a different story.

197
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:11,695
You like BDSM sites?

198
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,739
Hmm? He says that's
where you guys met.

199
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,116
You offered to pay him to tie
you up and have sex with him,

200
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,285
but you were interrupted 'cause
your wife came home early.

201
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,411
And you believe him?

202
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:21,830
[Judith] You, you...

203
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:25,249
- You did what?
- Okay. Come on. This guy's a liar.

Do you wanna get that?

208
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:45,770
Uh...

209
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,944
- Where you from?
- San Pedro.

210
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:55,738
No, shit, what part?

211
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:58,366
- Wilmington.
- Wow, I grew up on Cabrillo.

212
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:00,034
- No way.
- Yeah, off Gatun.

213
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:01,244
You still live there?

214
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,498
No. No, I moved out.

215
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:06,082
I see.

216
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,501
Are you gonna arrest me?

217
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:09,502
No.

218
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,089
But get your shit
together. This ain't it.

219
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:14,757
Yes, sir.

220
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:20,096
Hey, nothing on the husband?

221
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:21,222
Solicitation?

222
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:22,431
Making a false report?

223
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:25,434
No, it's not our case to make.
We gotta hand this over to Vice.

224
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:29,021
And if we're lucky, they'll follow
up with him, close the loop, but...

225
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,607
he's not going to jail.

226
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,859
Messed up how fast he threw
the kid under the bus.

227
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,028
Well, he'll get his. Did
you see the wife's face

228
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,115
- when his phone rang?
- [scoffs] Yeah.

229
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:40,158
<i>Pinche gueros.</i>

230
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:43,328
Hey, so you wanna tell me what
the fuck happened back there?

231
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,205
- What, with the kid?
- Yeah, outside the house.

232
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,456
Why did you freeze up?

233
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,084
You had exigent
circumstance to enter.

234
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,461
I-I didn't know if he
was in there for sure.

235
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,296
I was playing it by the book.

236
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:57,174
A few days ago, you're playing
superhero, chasing after Maniac,

237
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,803
but now you're too chickenshit
to chase a suspect into a house?

238
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,681
- I'm not chickenshit.
- Okay. So what?

239
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,351
Come on. I thought we were at the
point where we could shoot it straight.

240
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:08,978
- We are. I...
- Does it have anything to do

241
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:12,232
with what you asked me earlier?
About me getting cops fired?

242
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,651
I'm just trying
to follow the law.

243

[phone vibrating]

244
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:23,785
You gotta know the

- Hey.
- [Koy] <i>Padawan, get my message?</i>

246

Uh, no, I was tied up
on a 459. What's up?

<i>Yeah, for real.
You're a hard charger.</i>

251
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,302
<i>I could use you.</i>

252
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:43,804
Well, there's no shot command
staff is gonna let me off patrol.

253
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:46,474
<i>Ah, fuck 'em. They can't keep
you in purgatory forever.</i>

254
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:48,225
I'd really like to
believe that, but...

Mm-hmm.

Anyone get the drop on
Delgado's shooter yet?

No.

269
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:48,537
The detectives think that
Maniac went southbound and down.

270
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:50,830
To Mexico?

271
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:54,251
You think they're right?

272
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:03,885

Nobody called the cops.

279

Cops are here.

What the fuck?

283
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,990
[Harmon] You rather I
drop by when you're open?

284
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:52,869
I'd rather you not
drop by at all.

285
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,665

Your daughter is... how old now?

What do you want?

288
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:10,804
A kid named Maniac.

289
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,139
He killed a police officer.

290
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:15,100
I heard.

291
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:17,102

00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,406
You and me, we got
a mutual respect.

300

You know that.

301
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:15,701
It was handled.

302
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,537
Is that what Cortez was?

303
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,248
Some sort of peace offering?

304
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,335
Could be seen that way.

305
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,632
Then why didn't Maniac
get his ticket punched?

306
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:31,968

Is Maniac in Mexico?

00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,018
I'll make it simple.

Stop looking.

Or someone will be
looking for you.

don't wait up for me, okay?

Okay. What'd he say?

334
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,446
He said stop looking for Maniac.

335
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:19,200
Think about it.

336
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:21,703
If he was really in Mexico...

337
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:25,529
There'd be nothing to look for.

00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:22,638
Shit in a neighbor's yard
a few days ago. Now this.

350
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:24,432
- What'd she look like?
- Feral.

351
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:26,892
Can you narrow it down?

352
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,645
Think she was wearing
purple sweatpants.

353
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,272
Which way'd she go?

354
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,192
Over there, screaming
like a banshee.

355
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:36,485
Right. Go check it out.

356
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:37,444
- [Diaz] Yes, sir.
- [Harmon] All right.

357
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:39,739
[Lasman] Hey, Harmon, can
you hang back for a sec?

358
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:48,539
So I, uh, I guess
you didn't hear?

359
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:49,998
Hear about what?

360
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:52,334
Department's being sued for that
street takeover the other night.

361
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:53,377
Sued by who?

362
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:54,545
Some shop owner.

363
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:58,216
When we pulled out, mob
destroyed his store.

364
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:03,512
- That was the Watch Commander's call.
- No, no, no, that was your call.

365
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:05,390
Based on how you
framed the situation.

366
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,475
I got us out of
a dangerous spot.

367
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:09,935
Since when is danger
not a part of the job?

368
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:11,103
I kept my trainee safe.

369
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:12,020
You kept him on a leash

370
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,605
because you didn't think
he could handle himself.

371
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:16,733
And because of that, we left
people to fend for themselves.

372
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:17,734
You know...

373
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:21,072
Maybe you're cool with that.

374
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:22,572
I'm not.

375
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:34,752
[Holt] We're doing
this without PPE?

376
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,296
You wanna tell Sarge you don't
wanna get your boots dirty?

377
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,965
Okay, then, here we go.

378
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:40,967
[clears throat]

379
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:45,303
All right. You two go up there,
I'll check out over here.

380
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,347
- Yep.
- Yep.

381
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:02,612
[Holt] Jesus.

382
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,533
- God.
- [Diaz] Keep moving.

383
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:08,870
[Holt] Yep. Okay.

384
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:18,086
[woman screaming]

385
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:19,380
What the fuck was that?

386
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:22,842
- I think it came from over there.
- All right, come on.

387
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:33,977
- [Diaz] See anything?
- [Holt] No.

388
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:36,022
[grunting]

389
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:38,231
[Diaz] Hey! Hey!

390
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:40,025
- Hey!
- [Holt] Fuck off.

391
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:42,360
- [Diaz] Motherfuck... Stay down.
- [man] No.

392
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,905
- Stay down, bitch!
- [grunting]

393
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:48,700
- [Holt] Fuck.
- Hey, no. Hey, Holt, enough.

394
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,453
Okay? Enough.

395
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:54,415
- Are you good? Okay.
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

396
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:56,583
Oh, shit.

397
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,294
- What?
- Uh...

398
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,003
Just don't move, okay?

399
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:01,463
- Just...
- What is it?

400
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:02,714
Don't move.

401
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,216
- What?
- Just don't move.

402
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:05,842
- [Holt chokes]
- Hey, hey, hey.

403
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:08,053
Hey, hey, hey!

404
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,931
Holt! Holt! Holt!

405
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:11,933
Fuck. Holt, stay with me.

406
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:14,726
Fuck.

407
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:18,313
Help!

408
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,442
- [coughing]
- Hey, hey, hey.

409
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:24,778
Hey, hey, look at
me. Hey, look at me.

410
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:26,113
- [Harmon] What happened?
- [Diaz] I got you.

411
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:27,948
- What happened?
- [Lasman] Charlie-89...

412
00:23:27,949 --> 00:23:30,909
[Diaz] The guy just... The
guy put a needle in his neck

413
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,744
and I Narcaned him.

414
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:35,580
Okay. Sit down. Sit down.

415
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:38,125
- [Lasman] Come on. Holt, come on.
- [Harmon] Breathe.

416
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:40,752
I Narcaned him. I Narcaned him.

417
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:41,795
Okay. Okay.

418
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:43,839
He, um, he got, he got pricked.

419
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,882
- And... [coughs]
- Okay, okay. Calm down.

420
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:47,926
You're good. You're
good. Breathe. Breathe.

421
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:51,097
[panting]

422
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:58,187
[Harmon] You're good.
You're good. You're good.

423
00:23:58,688 --> 00:23:59,688
I'm good.

424
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:07,404
[Harmon] <i>Next on</i> On Call...

425
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:09,030
- Cuff him.
- I've got something you wanna hear.

426
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:10,240
- For real!
- [Diaz] I got it.

427
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:12,075
There were some fools
from East Barrio earlier.

428
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:14,120
- East Barrio?
- Killed the cop, right?

429
00:24:14,704 --> 00:24:16,496
All you gotta do
is say yes or no.

430
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:17,706
Seen him around?

431
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:19,124
Goes by Maniac.

432
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,001
Oceanside Motel.

433
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:22,670
- Stay by my side.
- Okay. Okay.

434
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,716
[theme music playing]
