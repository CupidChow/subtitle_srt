You care for your husband and work
at the store every day.

00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,600
Aren't you tired?

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,820
You portion out the goods and
bring them each time.

10
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,450
It's such a hassle.

11
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,260
You're creating more work.
Just leave it at my place.

12
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,270

I sent it.

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,380
You could've told me. Why did you text?

18
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,000
What's this?

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,310
A list of customers.

20
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,590
I have a blacklist, a list of new
customers, and regulars.

21
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,040
You should study them, too.

22
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,020
We're a team now. Don't you trust me?

23
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,170
Do you trust me?

24
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,800

The leaves are still here.

28
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:26,710
- Why do you say that?
- I worked as a server for three years around here.

29

30
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:32,000
But I worked over there
where Mijeong Restaurant is.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,680
And I just found out today that
there was such a huge tree here.

32
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:47,750
You know, I like waking up
in the morning these days.

33
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:52,360
Caring for my husband and working
at the store aren't tiring at all.

34

I just can't help but smile.

35
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,900
Seeing the leaves swaying like this

36
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,420
makes me feel like the world has changed.

37
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,330

It doesn't. This is 300 years old.

41
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,220
It was designated to be protected on the same day.

42
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,450
You can tell it was reborn.

43
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,620
People recognized it and gave it a name.

44
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,070
It was a normal tree,
but it became one to be protected.

45
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:53,330
You asked me what I wanted to do last time.

46
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:56,440
I have something I want to hear instead.

but I want to hear, "Eun Soo,

52

you're so good. You're good at everything."

53
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,410
Is it because it's a protected tree?

54
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,640
Doesn't standing here make you feel like

55
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,780

Just go home.

Husbands coming home late
and not helping with child rearing

64

Where could it be?

79
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,090
Where could you have hidden it, huh?

80
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,770
Is it here?

81
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,830
Are you hiding it here?

82
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,910
I found it.

83
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,650
Amazing, Ahjumma. How did you think of this?

84
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:31,470
Have you been sleeping with the drugs?

Where's the money?

86
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,750
You sold that. You need to return the money, too.

87

T-That's all.

88
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,540
I-I just kept it at home.

89
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:11,690
I just kept it because I didn't
know who it belonged to.

T-Take all of it.

91

I-I swear I won't report you.

92
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,390
I didn't report the drugs, either.

Geez, this little thief.

You'll never know.

125
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,810
Can we really go on our own?

126
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:30,780
The Boss would make things worse.

You're late. Did you have fun with your friend?

154

You aren't using the heater, are you?

157
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,190
I told you to use it when you're home alone, too.

I didn't know you were working
as a housekeeper for Mr. Lee.

163
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:47,800
I also wondered...

164
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,630
if you were making money by doing something weird.

165
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,780
I'm sorry. I should've trusted you.

What's this, Team Leader?

178
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,340
It's the leftover after paying my wife alimony.

00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,040
Is it a loan payment?

182
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,830
I shouldn't have bought a house
I couldn't afford last year.

183
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,090
I owe millions a month just in interest.

184
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:56,920
I can't even imagine paying off the principal.

185
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:00,210
That's how life is.

186
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,120
But I can't accept this.

187
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,510
You gave me the most for
my baby's first birthday, too.

188
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,760
You know what?

189
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,950
People quit often in our field.

190
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:17,270
Whether they wanted to or were forced to.

191
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,980
There are many temptations.

192
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:25,210
Even if we worked our asses off to get paid,

193
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:27,690
the thieves we catch can

194
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:31,470
easily make that money in a day.

195
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,730
Once you see that, it drives you crazy.

196
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,550
You find it unfair.

197
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:38,260
They know that. That's why they tempt us.

198
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:42,750
You know Detective Park got
exonerated two years ago, right?

199
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:46,180
Those assholes put the money
in the trunk and framed us. To screw us.

200
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:50,350
Their tricks put our lives on the line.

201
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:54,600
Why are you telling me this?

202
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,260
Being honest and working hard

203
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,970
doesn't reward us anymore.

204
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,910
Let's hang in there.

205
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,990
We need bastards like you

206
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,570
to have hope in this world.

207
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:14,660
I'll make sure to pay you back.

208
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,540
Just find the drug bag.

209
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:20,890
Won't that get a promotion for our entire team?

210
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,710
- Let's eat just this much.
- What is it?

211
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,410
Two bottles of alcohol and two bags of chips.

212
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:39,790
I need more! I need more!

213
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,810
I need more, too!

214
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,530
Come, come...

215
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,260
It's okay. It won't be visible.

216
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,760
Take this.

217
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,810
Mom, make me ramen.

218
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,410
<i>I'll meet with Yeo Ju briefly.</i>

219
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,430
<i>Hey, Su Ah.</i>

220
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:32,540
<i>I-I didn't get to tell you
because I was in a hurry.</i>

221
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:35,830
She wanted to talk about something briefly.

222
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,240
I'll be back soon.

223
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,040
Pick up some ramen on the way. A spicy kind.

224
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,820
Okay, I will.

225
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,320
Okay. See you later.

226
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:26,320
Tell me. How many of you are there?
Who else knows about this?

227
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:30,080
You're all dead.

228
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:23,250
Get treated first.

229
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,870
This is a matter of life and death.

230
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:30,720
Is this important?

231
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,830
Thankfully, their higher-ups
don't seem to know yet.

232
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:45,050
I guess they were going to tell them
after getting rid of us.

233
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:48,550
It looks like "The Owner" is the boss.

234
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,880
He hasn't mentioned us yet.

235
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:56,530
Is Dong Hyeon really a member of Phantom?

236
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:01,380
Let's come up with a plan first.
How to get rid of them.

237
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,600
G-Get rid of them?

238
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,570
Do we just leave them like that?

239
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:06,360
How long do you think we can keep them in there?

240
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,800
They'll try to kill us first once they wake up.

241
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:12,470
B-But still.

242
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:15,440
There's no time. We need to decide now.

243
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,480
I heard the supply truck comes at 7.

244
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,680
I'm not saying this lightly.

245
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,520
If we don't kill them,

246
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,250
we'll die.

247
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:36,250
Do you want your family to go
through what they did to us?

[My Daughter]

249
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:35,760
It's not as good anymore.

250
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,740
Everything seems so boring
after I started using Mint.

251
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,590
That's what I'm saying.

252
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:42,440
Where's James?

253
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,150
Wasn't he supposed to come today?

254
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,570
You said he comes whenever you call.

255
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:48,920
Why isn't he coming?

256
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,670
I wouldn't have come if I had known.

257
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,870
I can't stay because I feel too anxious.

258
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:04,170
I'll drop off Su Ah at her uncle's.

259
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,790
Let's... Let's do it when I'm back.

263
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:50,730
- Hey.
- Where are you?

264
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:52,090
You weren't picking up.

265
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:55,170
I'm dealing with a personal matter.

266
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:57,720
You should've let me know, at least.

267
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,740
Everyone is here.

268
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:02,830
Sorry.

269
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,400
I've been so out of it.

270
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,590
So, when will you come?

271
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,480
I don't think I could today.

272
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:36,440
Hyung, Hyung!

273
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:55,630
Are you completely out of
what I gave you last time?

274
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,760
It was quite a bit.

275
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,540
Damn it! How dare you treat me like an addict?

276
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,520
Hey.

277
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,640
You think I'm just like those bastards?

278
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:47,460
How dare you act up just
because I've treated you nicely?

279
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,550
<i>You did this last time, too.</i>

280
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,200
<i>You only sent the attorney
while acting like you were coming.</i>

281
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,070
<i>How dare you?</i>

282
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:12,420
<i>Don't you know who you should prioritize?</i>

283
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:17,240
I said I can't talk right now.

284
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,610
Let's talk later.

285
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,430
<i>What did you say, you bastard?</i>

286
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:23,710
<i>Say that again.</i>

287
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:26,110
<i>Say that again, I said!</i>

288
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,740
The hospital? No, the Boss...

289
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,740
Shit. The bag.

290
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:58,620
<i>Shut up and come right now.</i>

291

<i>You're out if you don't come today. Understand?</i>

Hold on. There's a car...

You son of a bitch. I'll kill you.

00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,230
Thank you. Be good, okay?

00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:10,000

It's a body that arrived early this morning.

324
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:58,340
His outfit matched your
wanted suspect description.

325
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:03,890
Similar, right? The trauma is severe,
and the organs were seriously damaged.

326
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:07,070
He died from blood loss
on the way to the hospital.

327
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:08,980
The important thing is the blood test result.

328
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,560
He tested positive for the drug test.

329
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,240
Make sure to do that.

330
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:21,310
About the serial trespassing case
from the Violent Crimes Unit.

331
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:23,600
- They're giving it to our team.
- Why?

332
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:27,120
They found a trace of a substance
on the deceased suspect.

333
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,340
It was Phantom's new meth.

334
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:43,010
His grandma, who raised him, died

335
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:45,750
and he lived with his relatives in Ansan.

336
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:49,090
He moved to Seoul after his older
brother turned legally adult.

337
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:51,020
To find a job.

338
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:58,670
Huh?

339
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:05,400
Yes, it's them.

340
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,940
They fought James at Gwangjin Station.

341
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:14,570
Wait. Does that make them Phantom members?

342
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:16,070
Which one died?

343
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:18,380
Was it the younger one?

344
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:21,690
The other one is still unconscious.

345
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:25,570
They aren't sure if he could wake up.

346
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:28,100
What goes around comes around.

347
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:47,930
Eun Soo, did you clean the storage room?

348
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:51,150
<i>Nothing at all happened.</i>

00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,790

00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:37,380

<i>You need to stay the same.</i>

Seriously. You're so diligent.

354
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:47,130
I thought a cleaning company did it.

Thank you.

356
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:59,510

357
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:02,290
