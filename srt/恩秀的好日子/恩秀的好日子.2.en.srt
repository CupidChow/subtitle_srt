WALKING ON THIN ICE

2
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:44,999
DRUG USE ISN'T JUST A MERE
DEVIATION BUT A SERIOUS CRIME

3
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,432
A SINGLE WRONG
CHOICE CAN DESTROY

4
00:00:46,444 --> 00:00:48,240
AN INDIVIDUAL, A FAMILY,
AND SOCIETY AS A WHOLE

00:00:48,772 --> 00:00:49,959
KOREAN AIRPORT CUSTOMS

6
00:00:59,523 --> 00:01:01,147
Drugs in Korea?

7
00:01:01,368 --> 00:01:04,159
It used to be hard
to bring them in or to sell them.

8
00:01:04,841 --> 00:01:06,132
Delivery!

9
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:07,857
Why?

10
00:01:07,927 --> 00:01:08,952
Firstly,

11
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:13,959
people in this country
are super sensitive about morality.

12
00:01:17,683 --> 00:01:22,890
Secondly, Korean customs
and the police do their job well.

13
00:01:36,077 --> 00:01:38,042
Finally!

14
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:39,083
Come out!

15
00:01:40,584 --> 00:01:42,998
You won't come out?
Fine then.

16
00:01:42,999 --> 00:01:44,375
Don't come out.

17
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:48,334
No, you don't!

18
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,999
- Fuck you!
- Hey, move aside!

19
00:02:12,417 --> 00:02:14,626
90% of them get caught and fail.

20
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:15,667
Bingo.

21
00:02:20,563 --> 00:02:23,396
But there's always that lucky 10%.

22
00:02:32,042 --> 00:02:34,999
High risk, high return.

23
00:02:39,999 --> 00:02:41,834
MR. HWANG DONGHYUN'S INTERVIEW RESULTS

24
00:02:42,999 --> 00:02:45,459
WE REGRET TO INFORM YOU
THAT YOU DID NOT PASS

25
00:03:09,999 --> 00:03:11,626
I'm sorry.

26
00:03:17,334 --> 00:03:21,000
That's why people keep trying,
to get that 10%.

27
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:26,375
For someone with no hope,
drugs can be like stocks or coins.

28
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:33,125
LEE KYUNG

29
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,042
CAN I ORDER 10G? (NEED STRAWS TOO)

30
00:04:03,346 --> 00:04:04,554
Me?

31
00:04:05,171 --> 00:04:06,588
I'm different.

32
00:04:07,334 --> 00:04:08,999
For me,

33
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,751
these are like game chips.

34
00:04:18,417 --> 00:04:20,542
To get me to the real prize.

35
00:04:29,417 --> 00:04:31,083
I'm curious.

36
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,074
What else can the lady give me?

37
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:38,083
EPISODE 2

38
00:04:45,721 --> 00:04:47,053
Are you down or not?

39
00:04:51,944 --> 00:04:54,529
I need it tomorrow.
At least 15g up front.

40
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,258
Who are you, huh?

41
00:05:32,902 --> 00:05:35,083
Wait. The cleaning lady?

42
00:05:35,952 --> 00:05:36,952
What the hell?

43
00:05:39,286 --> 00:05:40,662
Why are you following me?

44
00:05:43,505 --> 00:05:46,292
It's me.
Don't you recognize me?

45
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,042
Sua's mother?

46
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,584
No way.
What are you doing here?

47
00:05:57,626 --> 00:05:58,626
James.

48
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,636
You're James, aren't you?

49
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,918
No, let me explain.

50
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,083
A guy I know needed
some help at the club.

51
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,209
Count me in.

52
00:06:15,732 --> 00:06:17,159
- What?
- Let's work together.

53
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:29,125
Let's be partners.
You and me.

54
00:09:00,936 --> 00:09:03,477
Never imagined I'd meet
a parent like this.

55
00:09:04,999 --> 00:09:07,999
I'm sure I was the one
more surprised.

56
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:12,459
How long have you been
working at Medusa?

57
00:09:13,856 --> 00:09:16,999
Well, not that long.

58
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:20,459
When did you start doing this?

59
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,834
Where'd you get it?
I've never seen this.

60
00:09:25,945 --> 00:09:28,351
Do I really have to tell you?

61
00:09:28,398 --> 00:09:30,445
I don't buy things
from unknown sources.

62
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:39,542
Suit yourself.
There are plenty of buyers.

63
00:09:39,592 --> 00:09:40,801
Who?

64
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:45,271
Tell me. Everyone knows
everyone in the drug scene.

65
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,292
I'll tell you if he's trustworthy.
Free of charge.

66
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:53,580
Have you forgotten that I caught you?

67
00:09:54,004 --> 00:09:55,004
So what?

68
00:09:56,048 --> 00:09:56,830
Huh?

69
00:09:57,667 --> 00:09:59,916
Are you going to tell everyone about me?

70
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:04,358
The quiet art tutor
turns out to be a drug dealer...

71
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,834
There's no reason not to.

72
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:09,218
Then should I tell Sua too?

73
00:10:09,417 --> 00:10:11,061
What her mom came here to sell?

74
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,500
Remember this.

75
00:10:15,542 --> 00:10:20,145
If you use someone's weakness,
you'll end up with one of your own.

76
00:10:21,626 --> 00:10:25,105
Sit down. Let's do business.
We need a contract.

77
00:10:27,933 --> 00:10:31,097
Are we really partnering up?

78
00:10:46,218 --> 00:10:47,384
Be honest.

79
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:51,182
You came here all relaxed,
didn't you?

80
00:10:51,268 --> 00:10:53,334
Thinking a beating will fix it all, eh?

81
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,166
Knife.

82
00:10:56,112 --> 00:10:57,795
No, boss.

83
00:10:57,818 --> 00:10:59,199
Then why are you empty-handed?

84
00:10:59,542 --> 00:11:01,959
Donghyun,
do you know what you lost?

85
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,658
That drug is way above
your usual shit.

86
00:11:04,682 --> 00:11:09,042
Specially made for VIP sales
with zero impurities.

87
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:13,397
And your group's Bongnam stole it
and died before we could even launch.

88
00:11:13,913 --> 00:11:18,250
If you knew your sins,
you should've brought back the bag.

89
00:11:18,336 --> 00:11:21,626
Isn't that simple common sense?

90
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:23,779
Did you really go to college?

91
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:26,607
Who ordered Bongnam
to go pick up the drugs?

92
00:11:26,622 --> 00:11:28,763
It was you, boss!
How is that our fault?

93
00:11:28,786 --> 00:11:29,999
Shut the fuck up!

94
00:11:41,542 --> 00:11:42,999
Partnership Contract

95
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:47,876
This contract is between
James and Kang Eunsoo.

96
00:11:47,918 --> 00:11:51,268
For the purpose of supplying
and selling meth,

97
00:11:51,354 --> 00:11:53,834
and it lays out the rules
to be followed.

98
00:11:58,358 --> 00:12:00,108
Don't stop, keep reading.

99
00:12:00,764 --> 00:12:02,709
Or should we call it off?

100
00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:09,876
One. Kang Eunsoo agrees
to supply meth to James.

101
00:12:10,542 --> 00:12:15,876
Two. If section one gets leaked
without James's consent,

102
00:12:15,918 --> 00:12:17,918
the partnership will be terminated.

103
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:39,083
Three. If Kang Eunsoo
fails to uphold section two

104
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,834
or is responsible for
causing damage to James,

105
00:12:42,876 --> 00:12:44,542
Kang Eunsoo must compensate.

106
00:12:44,584 --> 00:12:47,209
Four. If any problem arises

107
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:51,334
due to the source of the product,
Kang Eunsoo must take full responsibility.

108
00:12:59,484 --> 00:13:02,959
Five. The profit will be split
7:3 in favor of James.

109
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:04,999
Are you kidding me?

110
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,756
Not one bit.

111
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:14,611
All you have to do is
provide meth from home.

112
00:13:14,635 --> 00:13:19,064
I have to distribute and keep
customers happy - so much more work.

113
00:13:22,697 --> 00:13:24,447
I'll agree on one condition.

114
00:13:27,115 --> 00:13:30,834
If I become more valuable
than I am now, we renegotiate.

115
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:35,474
Interesting.

116
00:13:36,907 --> 00:13:40,292
I look forward to seeing
how valuable you become.

117
00:13:45,915 --> 00:13:46,999
Keep reading.

118
00:13:55,604 --> 00:13:56,559
One question.

119
00:13:58,117 --> 00:13:59,200
What's the drug's name?

120
00:13:59,727 --> 00:14:02,203
Itâ€™s too pure
to be just regular meth.

121
00:14:04,703 --> 00:14:06,584
- Vaka.
- What?

122
00:14:07,953 --> 00:14:10,667
They look like Vaka peppermint candies.

123
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:22,254
Pretty catchy name.

124
00:14:24,304 --> 00:14:25,429
Why do you do this?

125
00:14:26,215 --> 00:14:29,292
You look like a noobie,
and a very scared one.

126
00:14:31,918 --> 00:14:35,500
I know it's not my business.

127
00:14:36,815 --> 00:14:37,815
But I'm just curious.

128
00:14:38,331 --> 00:14:43,023
That's right.
It's none of your business.

129
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:15,459
I actually pulled it off.

130
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:19,999
I... I did it.

131
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:30,459
Bro!

132
00:15:35,436 --> 00:15:38,417
You bastard, I'll kill you!

133
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:49,417
What do we do, bro?

134
00:15:58,906 --> 00:15:59,906
Junhyun.

135
00:16:01,891 --> 00:16:06,209
If you don't find the bag,
it won't end with your brother's finger.

136
00:16:06,776 --> 00:16:08,233
I'll chop his hands and feet.

137
00:16:09,382 --> 00:16:10,424
You hear me?

138
00:16:12,999 --> 00:16:13,999
I can't hear you.

139
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,999
Yes, I understand.

154
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:22,547
I hope this doesn't screw me over.

155
00:18:26,334 --> 00:18:29,542
The shape and composition
are different though.

156
00:18:32,983 --> 00:18:36,151
Argh, why now?

158
00:18:47,999 --> 00:18:50,998
The phone you have dialed
is switched off.

159
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:53,292
Please leave a message
after the beep.

160
00:19:02,903 --> 00:19:04,459
Huh?

161
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:06,161
Let go of him! Stop!

162
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:10,191
Promise me, Junhyun.
Promise me...

163
00:19:19,753 --> 00:19:21,456
Bro!

164
00:19:21,922 --> 00:19:23,968
Let go of me!

165
00:19:33,197 --> 00:19:34,554
Does it hurt a lot?

166
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,083
It's not too bad yet.

167
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,459
You need to start treatment soon.

168
00:19:46,266 --> 00:19:47,266
I'm sorry.

169
00:19:50,881 --> 00:19:53,969
About everything.

170
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,500
Hey...

171
00:20:02,349 --> 00:20:03,390
Do you remember?

172
00:20:05,135 --> 00:20:10,011
You used to bring home dogs and cats
from the streets all the time.

173
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,918
Especially the ones sick or hurt.

174
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:19,292
And you didn't even know
you were allergic to fur.

175
00:20:19,334 --> 00:20:23,500
Coughing and sniffling,
saying that you had a cold.

176
00:20:25,137 --> 00:20:28,471
I was annoyed,
but at the same time,

177
00:20:28,902 --> 00:20:34,042
I wondered if you married me because
you have a thing for the vulnerable.

178
00:20:35,647 --> 00:20:38,000
Did I look like I needed help too?

179
00:20:38,733 --> 00:20:42,061
Struggling by myself
with both my parents gone?

180
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:43,999
No.

181
00:20:46,751 --> 00:20:47,792
You looked great.

182
00:20:49,275 --> 00:20:53,692
I admired your drive
for a better life.

183
00:20:54,792 --> 00:20:55,918
That's why I married you.

184
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:01,792
Don't let that mind change.

185
00:21:03,077 --> 00:21:05,912
No matter what I do
or who I become.

186
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:10,696
Of course.

187
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,999
You've never been wrong.

188
00:21:26,335 --> 00:21:28,252
I hope I'm not wrong right now.

189
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:08,998
Hey chat, can you guess where I am?

190
00:22:08,999 --> 00:22:11,334
Happy birthday, Mimi!

191
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:14,250
Can you wave this way too?

192
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:17,375
- It's Mimi's birthday!
- Congratulations!

193
00:22:18,582 --> 00:22:20,871
Chat, guess where I am!

194
00:22:20,886 --> 00:22:23,949
I'm at Mimi's birthday party!

195
00:22:28,709 --> 00:22:30,375
Did you bring your presents?

196
00:22:37,891 --> 00:22:40,083
Let's do it one at a time.

197
00:22:43,709 --> 00:22:46,125
- Congrats!
- Happy birthday!

198
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,000
Cut it out, Seonjae.

199
00:22:49,042 --> 00:22:50,500
Why? It's fun!

200
00:22:51,584 --> 00:22:52,998
Oh, there you are.

201
00:22:52,999 --> 00:22:54,626
Hey, James.

202
00:22:54,811 --> 00:22:57,810
Everyone, say hi.
He's the party planner for today.

203
00:22:57,878 --> 00:22:59,999
Oh, really? Impressive!

204
00:23:02,638 --> 00:23:03,638
First time seeing them?

205
00:23:03,959 --> 00:23:04,959
This is Seonjae.

206
00:23:05,328 --> 00:23:07,078
The nephew of
the Vice Minister of Justice.

207
00:23:07,591 --> 00:23:10,334
This is Hwirim.
Kang Hwirim.

208
00:23:21,459 --> 00:23:24,626
{\an8}KANG HWIRIM, BORN JULY 11, 1992,
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF TWON HOLDINGS

209
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:37,569
Hey, Hey! Hurry and hand over
your smartphones.

210
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:40,292
We can't upset our
Executive Director Kang, right?

211
00:23:43,139 --> 00:23:44,891
Do we really have to?

212
00:23:46,638 --> 00:23:47,721
Don't lose it.

213
00:23:48,292 --> 00:23:50,542
You're an executive now.
You need to be careful.

214
00:23:52,447 --> 00:23:56,167
Executive Director already?
You've only worked for two years.

215
00:23:56,713 --> 00:23:59,709
Why does that matter?
It's his family company.

216
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:03,763
James, you too.

217
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,403
Hurry up.

218
00:24:17,564 --> 00:24:20,542
Are you James?
I meet you at last.

219
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,834
I've heard so much about you.

220
00:24:23,918 --> 00:24:25,209
Oh.

221
00:24:26,183 --> 00:24:27,567
Wait a second.

222
00:24:33,474 --> 00:24:36,557
Familiar face?
I heard you two met.

223
00:24:36,999 --> 00:24:38,999
This is my childhood friend.

224
00:24:39,615 --> 00:24:41,281
You should've gone easy on him.

225
00:24:42,554 --> 00:24:45,888
Well, I guess there are always
people like you.

226
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:49,167
Thinking you're actually somebody
for getting a little attention.

227
00:24:50,761 --> 00:24:51,975
It's called crossing the line.

228
00:24:52,045 --> 00:24:55,082
And they always turn out
to be pathetic losers.

229
00:24:57,755 --> 00:24:59,672
This party isn't that bad.

230
00:25:02,405 --> 00:25:04,224
Except for the crowd.

231
00:25:06,999 --> 00:25:08,128
It's the most important.

232
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:12,636
Chill, this is your
girlfriend's birthday party.

233
00:25:12,784 --> 00:25:14,417
Who cares about the crowd?

234
00:25:15,792 --> 00:25:16,999
I like it.

235
00:25:17,096 --> 00:25:21,918
Hey, can you plan my birthday too?
Something similar to this.

236
00:25:22,459 --> 00:25:25,251
Bro, he's not even the owner.

237
00:26:05,334 --> 00:26:06,827
My gift. It's brand new.

238
00:28:45,209 --> 00:28:48,375
Mom, you're sleeping at the hospital
and coming in the morning, right?

239
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,366
Yeah, did you eat dinner?

240
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:01,553
Yeah, I had bulgogi at Jinhee's.

241
00:29:01,764 --> 00:29:04,250
Take care, see you tomorrow.
Love you.

242
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:13,000
Love you too.

243
00:29:18,729 --> 00:29:19,959
What the hell am I doing?

244
00:29:33,712 --> 00:29:35,196
- Sir.
- Yeah?

245
00:29:36,126 --> 00:29:39,584
It's already been days.
And we got nothing, right?

246
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:41,375
So?

247
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,856
I mean, it's not like we have intel.

248
00:29:45,864 --> 00:29:49,531
Blindly staking outside a club
doesn't seem efficient.

249
00:29:49,899 --> 00:29:52,083
Goodness gracious.

250
00:29:52,735 --> 00:29:56,742
Smart ass cops
always talk about efficiency.

251
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:02,941
Look, we swept Haengbok-dong
and found nothing.

252
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:05,999
So next, we search spots
with high chances of drug appearance.

253
00:30:07,183 --> 00:30:08,597
And we're not here blindly.

254
00:30:09,066 --> 00:30:11,667
I already called all my lookouts.

255
00:30:11,999 --> 00:30:13,851
If they see drug activity,
they'll call us.

256
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:17,688
- Like the club waiters?
- That's right.

257
00:30:18,093 --> 00:30:21,998
Didn't they fake a report
to cover up their VIPs,

258
00:30:21,999 --> 00:30:24,005
and got you in trouble?

259
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,000
Well, yeah.

260
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,701
That was ages ago!

261
00:30:31,626 --> 00:30:33,999
You remember the dumbest things.

262
00:30:35,451 --> 00:30:36,866
Are you fucking with me?

263
00:30:37,999 --> 00:30:39,500
No, not at all.

264
00:30:42,871 --> 00:30:44,079
Eat your burger, asshole.

265
00:31:25,626 --> 00:31:27,999
I know you like it too.

266
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:46,292
I'll take care of him.

267
00:31:50,459 --> 00:31:52,542
I just wanted to touch you.

268
00:31:52,584 --> 00:31:53,584
What the fuck?

269
00:31:54,999 --> 00:31:57,093
I know you're a hooker.

270
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,608
What? You crazy bastard!

271
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:02,918
He's crazy!
What's wrong with him?

272
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:04,375
Move aside.

273
00:32:08,127 --> 00:32:09,709
- Out you go.
- The fuck?

274
00:32:09,751 --> 00:32:11,292
- Come on.
- Let me go!

275
00:32:11,792 --> 00:32:12,999
Let me go!

276
00:32:35,959 --> 00:32:38,724
You're asking for it, aren't you?

277
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:51,500
Do you wanna die?

278
00:32:51,588 --> 00:32:54,588
I'm going to kill you.

279
00:32:55,999 --> 00:32:58,999
Hey, do you know something?

280
00:33:01,682 --> 00:33:03,965
People who actually do kill

281
00:33:05,934 --> 00:33:10,113
usually act before they talk,
like me.

282
00:33:28,999 --> 00:33:30,584
Are you insane?

283
00:33:31,198 --> 00:33:33,550
I'm best friends with Hwirim!

284
00:33:33,999 --> 00:33:36,374
You think you'll get away with this?

285
00:33:36,999 --> 00:33:41,030
Fucking coward,
get your head straight.

286
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,725
Just because you're close
doesn't mean his power is yours.

287
00:33:46,042 --> 00:33:47,998
Now get the fuck out.

288
00:33:47,999 --> 00:33:49,810
And don't come here again.

289
00:34:06,667 --> 00:34:08,500
How dare you...

290
00:34:09,999 --> 00:34:12,167
You're nothing...

291
00:34:39,284 --> 00:34:41,065
What the hell are you staring at?

292
00:34:47,092 --> 00:34:48,343
Cleaning lady?

293
00:34:52,334 --> 00:34:55,752
You got me into shit with James.

294
00:34:59,604 --> 00:35:04,999
I paid so much to get access,
but because of you...

295
00:35:13,876 --> 00:35:14,876
Don't come closer!

296
00:35:20,167 --> 00:35:22,657
What, is that a gun?

297
00:35:23,854 --> 00:35:24,854
Shoot me.

298
00:35:25,837 --> 00:35:28,999
I'm pissed anyway, so bring it on.

299
00:35:29,265 --> 00:35:30,250
Shoot me!

300
00:35:30,292 --> 00:35:32,312
You think I won't?

301
00:35:34,751 --> 00:35:36,125
Are you crazy?

302
00:35:45,999 --> 00:35:50,559
Hey, you piss me off too.

303
00:35:52,395 --> 00:35:56,959
Come on, bring it on!

304
00:35:56,999 --> 00:36:01,876
Bring it, you little... pussy!

305
00:36:02,918 --> 00:36:04,459
Crazy bitch!

306
00:36:16,334 --> 00:36:19,999
I can't believe I actually cursed.
Gosh...

307
00:36:36,469 --> 00:36:37,843
What the hell?

308
00:36:52,167 --> 00:36:53,542
There's been an accident!

309
00:36:54,789 --> 00:36:57,209
- There's someone inside.
- He looks badly hurt.

310
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,751
Honey, call for help.

311
00:36:58,792 --> 00:37:02,250
- Who should I call?
- Call 119.

312
00:37:02,292 --> 00:37:03,542
Holy moly...

313
00:37:05,331 --> 00:37:10,000
Hello?

314
00:37:10,042 --> 00:37:11,584
Yes, uh...

315
00:37:14,876 --> 00:37:16,167
Lighten up.

316
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:23,250
Mimi, cheer up.

317
00:37:23,999 --> 00:37:26,918
There are always people like him,
who think they're something

318
00:37:26,959 --> 00:37:29,918
just cuz they got a little attention.

319
00:37:31,334 --> 00:37:33,654
One should never cross the line.

320
00:37:36,626 --> 00:37:37,584
Right?

321
00:37:37,638 --> 00:37:40,178
Of course, it's important.

322
00:37:40,412 --> 00:37:42,999
Looks like our new friend
won't be crossing his.

323
00:37:48,447 --> 00:37:50,834
What was it called? Vaka?

324
00:37:51,999 --> 00:37:53,709
This is ice, right?

325
00:37:54,999 --> 00:37:57,500
I've never seen it in this shape.

326
00:37:58,417 --> 00:38:00,083
Not bad!

327
00:38:00,583 --> 00:38:03,302
Not bad?
More like fucking awesome.

328
00:38:04,452 --> 00:38:07,195
This is sick,
where'd you get it?

329
00:38:10,053 --> 00:38:13,266
How much?
I'll pay whatever you want.

330
00:38:26,046 --> 00:38:28,255
You look damn familiar.

331
00:38:31,968 --> 00:38:33,062
Don't you know me?

332
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:37,876
Careful, hold him still.

333
00:38:38,751 --> 00:38:39,792
All set.

334
00:38:42,459 --> 00:38:43,709
Police...

335
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,918
- Is this the car?
- Yes.

336
00:39:37,366 --> 00:39:41,593
What are you saying?
Hey, are you hitting on him?

337
00:39:46,558 --> 00:39:48,266
Watch your mouth, Sunjae.

338
00:39:56,375 --> 00:39:57,998
Sorry, sorry, alright?

339
00:39:57,999 --> 00:40:00,876
Our Hwirim's tough as always.

340
00:40:01,929 --> 00:40:03,639
That hurt.

341
00:40:03,751 --> 00:40:05,615
Guess I've got a common face.

342
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,667
Oh, I wish that were true.

343
00:40:08,709 --> 00:40:09,999
You're too good-looking.

344
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:15,658
But seriously, where are you from?
I'm curious too.

345
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:20,334
I don't know you,
so you're not from here. Overseas?

346
00:40:21,214 --> 00:40:23,547
No, all the overseas
know each other.

347
00:40:30,999 --> 00:40:34,209
Don't tell me...
A club host?

348
00:40:34,962 --> 00:40:37,999
Yes, that kinda makes sense.

349
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:40,334
Then there's no way I wouldn't know.

350
00:40:40,618 --> 00:40:41,792
Let me guess.

351
00:40:41,834 --> 00:40:44,584
Gwangnam? Or Itaewon?

352
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:47,999
Right? Come on, tell us.

353
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:52,250
Relax, we don't have to rush things.

354
00:40:52,292 --> 00:40:55,584
Tonight we drink till we drop, okay?
Drink up!

355
00:40:55,626 --> 00:40:57,792
Let's drink!

356
00:41:19,038 --> 00:41:22,038
It's identical to the one
from Kim Bongnam's motel room.

357
00:41:27,125 --> 00:41:28,626
Where did he come from?

358
00:41:28,792 --> 00:41:31,834
I think from the parking lot...

359
00:41:31,876 --> 00:41:33,999
Should we check the security cameras?

360
00:42:12,876 --> 00:42:13,999
Mr. Lee!

361
00:42:15,999 --> 00:42:17,375
Mr. Lee!

362
00:42:19,999 --> 00:42:21,584
Mr. Lee!

363
00:42:26,918 --> 00:42:28,042
What the hell!

364
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:29,999
Stop shoving!

365
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,042
What's your problem?

366
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:34,083
Mr. Lee!

367
00:42:34,918 --> 00:42:35,918
Here...

368
00:42:46,167 --> 00:42:47,918
PARK BOHEE

369
00:42:47,959 --> 00:42:48,999
Do you have a warrant?

370
00:42:59,195 --> 00:43:00,943
At least one of you gets it.

371
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,534
Huh? What does he mean?

372
00:43:03,085 --> 00:43:05,140
It means we don't need a warrant.

373
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:07,209
Alright, let's go.

374
00:43:19,542 --> 00:43:20,542
Wait.

375
00:43:27,042 --> 00:43:28,042
Mr. Lee!

376
00:43:30,751 --> 00:43:32,375
Hey! Over here!

377
00:43:33,375 --> 00:43:35,209
Lee Kyung! Lee Kyung!

378
00:43:37,019 --> 00:43:38,100
Mr. Lee!

379
00:43:39,375 --> 00:43:40,375
Run!

380
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:00,626
James.

381
00:44:01,042 --> 00:44:02,709
What are you staring at?

382
00:44:03,459 --> 00:44:04,500
The cops are here.

383
00:44:06,083 --> 00:44:07,998
Should we move to the next spot?

384
00:44:07,999 --> 00:44:12,442
Next spot?
Yes, that sounds fun.

385
00:44:13,792 --> 00:44:14,998
Let's go for round two!

386
00:44:14,999 --> 00:44:16,542
Bro, it's me.
You open tonight?

387
00:44:17,792 --> 00:44:19,500
Let me rent out your whole bar.

388
00:44:19,542 --> 00:44:22,000
I'll pay double your sales,
so clear all the tables.

389
00:44:23,914 --> 00:44:26,125
Hey, I want an explanation.

390
00:44:27,959 --> 00:44:29,334
You can trust him.

391
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,834
Run, hurry!

392
00:44:38,792 --> 00:44:40,709
Let's go to round two!

393
00:44:45,876 --> 00:44:48,667
Police! Please step aside.

394
00:44:58,042 --> 00:45:00,459
- Coming through!
- Step aside!

395
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,626
Excuse me!

396
00:45:01,667 --> 00:45:03,667
- Hold on!
- Police!

397
00:45:04,999 --> 00:45:06,250
Coming through!

398
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:09,125
Please make way!

399
00:45:17,999 --> 00:45:19,918
Passing through!

400
00:45:19,959 --> 00:45:22,542
- Move aside!
- Coming through!

401
00:45:25,292 --> 00:45:26,876
Please make way!

402
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,243
- Secure the security camera footage.
- Yes, sir.

403
00:45:50,108 --> 00:45:51,276
Watch it!

404
00:46:19,959 --> 00:46:21,042
What's going on?

405
00:46:21,083 --> 00:46:24,959
Erase the hallway
and VIP rooms 1, 2, and 3.

406
00:46:24,999 --> 00:46:25,999
Understood.

407
00:46:26,709 --> 00:46:28,292
Don't touch anything.

408
00:46:28,334 --> 00:46:31,626
Gwangnam Drug Crimes Unit.
We're taking over.

409
00:46:41,626 --> 00:46:42,709
Just a moment.

410
00:46:44,999 --> 00:46:45,999
I want a constant update.

411
00:46:48,667 --> 00:46:50,626
Entering the VIP hallway.

412
00:47:00,709 --> 00:47:02,542
They just went into room 3.

413
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:18,999
Coming through.

414
00:47:21,918 --> 00:47:23,673
Yes, yes, go that way.

415
00:47:26,999 --> 00:47:28,959
Hey! What's going on?

416
00:47:30,504 --> 00:47:32,584
Oh, no.
It shut down.

417
00:47:37,918 --> 00:47:38,918
The fuck...?

418
00:47:40,626 --> 00:47:42,209
Is this the right place?

419
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,250
Where the hell did they go?

420
00:47:49,999 --> 00:47:51,083
Are you sure it's room 3?

421
00:48:09,999 --> 00:48:11,626
- What? Room 3?
- Room 3?

422
00:48:11,667 --> 00:48:12,999
- It's Room 3.
- Room 3!

423
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,667
Search the place.

424
00:48:14,709 --> 00:48:15,709
Room 3...

425
00:48:18,959 --> 00:48:20,125
Room 3...

426
00:49:15,209 --> 00:49:17,334
Let's go!

427
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:52,876
I'm telling you,
we don't sell that kind of stuff!

428
00:49:52,915 --> 00:49:56,930
Why are you ruining our business
based on shady leads?

429
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:58,999
Are you going to cover the loss?

430
00:49:59,375 --> 00:50:01,042
Will the police pay for it all?

431
00:50:02,293 --> 00:50:05,125
I'm going to sue for damages, okay?

432
00:50:13,999 --> 00:50:16,593
Sir, the security footages are gone.

433
00:50:52,583 --> 00:50:54,959
So, how was your first day?

434
00:50:58,834 --> 00:51:00,042
Ah...

435
00:51:01,922 --> 00:51:03,959
Is that how you usually party?

436
00:51:03,999 --> 00:51:07,792
With those people?
With your customers?

437
00:51:08,024 --> 00:51:10,746
Were you expecting me
to play hopscotch, or what?

438
00:51:15,098 --> 00:51:17,265
Don't be a wuss.

439
00:51:20,776 --> 00:51:24,999
Koreans are messed up.
There's so much bad stuff out there.

440
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,999
Yet they're so paranoid about drugs,
as if it's a vicious virus.

441
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:31,615
Isn't that what it is?

442
00:51:33,751 --> 00:51:37,919
Listen, what do you think leads
to more crime in this country?

443
00:51:37,954 --> 00:51:39,578
Drugs or alcohol?

444
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:43,459
Did I do real estate speculation?
Or run a stock scam?

445
00:51:43,571 --> 00:51:47,500
Honestly, they're worse.
The whole nation gets hurt.

446
00:51:49,399 --> 00:51:51,998
But with this, no one gets hurt.

447
00:51:51,999 --> 00:51:55,629
No one forces it.
They do it because they want to.

448
00:51:58,999 --> 00:52:01,403
- Try it if you're curious.
- No, no. I don't want to.

449
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:03,460
Scaredy-cat.

450
00:52:06,709 --> 00:52:09,859
If it's no big deal,
why don't you do it?

451
00:52:12,477 --> 00:52:16,000
Everyone was drinking
Vaka with champagne.

452
00:52:16,042 --> 00:52:18,375
But you didn't drink it.

453
00:52:22,999 --> 00:52:26,167
How did you notice?
You've got sharp eyes.

454
00:52:28,257 --> 00:52:31,459
- I've got an eye for detail...
- Stop showing off.

455
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,999
How about you give a hand?
Help with the count.

456
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:37,920
Sure.

457
00:52:57,147 --> 00:52:59,619
I split my tip 7:3 as well.

458
00:52:59,646 --> 00:53:03,936
It's my token of thanks
for helping me out today unexpectedly.

459
00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:20,333
And don't be curious about me anymore.

460
00:53:23,999 --> 00:53:25,209
Okay.

461
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:30,456
Are we done?

462
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:32,250
Wait.

463
00:53:33,141 --> 00:53:34,542
What now?

464
00:53:34,703 --> 00:53:36,411
How much will you bring next time?

465
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:40,250
The customers loved it.
We'll need a lot more.

466
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,684
Or you could just hand over
everything you have.

467
00:53:45,424 --> 00:53:48,131
What?
Are you that rich?

468
00:53:50,584 --> 00:53:51,999
How much do you have?

469
00:53:55,918 --> 00:53:56,999
One kilogram.

470
00:53:58,999 --> 00:54:00,334
One kilogram...

471
00:54:02,542 --> 00:54:04,999
That is quite a lot.

472
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:08,999
Fine, I can buy that amount in cash.

473
00:54:12,696 --> 00:54:13,944
I'll think about it.

474
00:54:30,036 --> 00:54:31,209
DELIVERY MAN

475
00:54:33,999 --> 00:54:35,417
Press one for voice mail...

476
00:54:39,334 --> 00:54:42,209
It's me.
Let's talk offline.

477
00:55:04,891 --> 00:55:06,432
Are you okay?

478
00:55:08,083 --> 00:55:09,751
I'm fine!

479
00:55:16,999 --> 00:55:19,959
Sorry, thank you.

480
00:56:09,936 --> 00:56:11,229
5 million won.

481
00:56:12,626 --> 00:56:16,209
This is more than my 3 months'
worth of salary at the store.

482
00:56:22,334 --> 00:56:24,000
5 million won a day...

483
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:25,667
You just got here?

484
00:57:26,459 --> 00:57:28,334
Yeah, go to sleep.

485
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:32,200
Mom, did you cry?

486
00:57:33,257 --> 00:57:34,966
No.

487
00:57:38,959 --> 00:57:42,000
Lair.
You're really swollen.

488
00:57:44,375 --> 00:57:46,167
Is something wrong with Dad?

489
00:57:51,125 --> 00:57:52,792
Did you have a nightmare?

490
00:57:53,297 --> 00:57:55,464
It's because you didn't sleep well.

491
00:57:56,584 --> 00:57:58,626
Don't sleep at the hospital.

492
00:58:01,626 --> 00:58:05,459
No, I had a good dream.

493
00:58:06,584 --> 00:58:08,998
A really good dream.

494
00:58:08,999 --> 00:58:11,704
I cried because it was so nice.

495
00:58:11,774 --> 00:58:17,876
Dummy. Then you should be
smiling, not crying.

496
00:58:19,735 --> 00:58:21,234
True...

497
00:59:35,792 --> 00:59:37,042
The sample you mentioned.

498
00:59:39,131 --> 00:59:40,171
What do you know about it?

499
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:45,667
I'm not sure yet.
I'll compare it with this first.

500
00:59:47,865 --> 00:59:48,742
Are you kidding me?

501
00:59:48,769 --> 00:59:53,018
Stop. If you look at my face,
the deal's over.

502
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:03,807
Sit down.

503
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:21,367
Stop acting like a kid.

504
01:00:22,226 --> 01:00:25,236
What will you do
when you catch the thief?

505
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:29,080
You really don't know?

506
01:00:33,999 --> 01:00:36,792
Alright.
Wait for my call.

507
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:43,744
Hey, where did you lose
the drug bag again?

508
01:00:46,445 --> 01:00:48,198
Payment for Park Dojin.

509
01:00:49,344 --> 01:00:51,093
Yes, one moment.

510
01:01:18,999 --> 01:01:20,998
KANG EUNSOO

511
01:01:20,999 --> 01:01:21,999
PHANTOM

512
01:02:04,769 --> 01:02:07,139
Where'd you get it?
I've never seen this.

513
01:02:10,162 --> 01:02:12,667
Do I really have to tell you?

514
01:02:12,709 --> 01:02:14,999
I don't buy things
from unknown sources.

515
01:02:47,782 --> 01:02:49,542
Long time no see.

516
01:02:50,551 --> 01:02:53,676
Girls, let's welcome back Sua.
Applause!

517
01:03:01,792 --> 01:03:05,792
As I said,
today we'll practice coloring.

518
01:03:05,834 --> 01:03:07,999
- Take out your stuff.
- Yes, Mr. Lee.

519
01:03:19,881 --> 01:03:20,921
Did you change your brush?

520
01:03:23,709 --> 01:03:24,999
Wow.

521
01:03:25,662 --> 01:03:28,498
It looks expensive, lucky you.

522
01:03:28,918 --> 01:03:32,834
Whoa, new paints too?
Way to go, Sua.

523
01:03:32,876 --> 01:03:34,209
You went flexing.

524
01:03:35,292 --> 01:03:37,551
Girls, look at Sua's paints.

525
01:03:37,630 --> 01:03:39,654
Wow, what is that?

526
01:03:43,215 --> 01:03:46,167
- It's amazing.
- It's really pretty.

527
01:03:46,209 --> 01:03:48,626
- The colors are so nice.
- Right?

528
01:03:48,999 --> 01:03:51,266
- I want one too.
- Me too.

529
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:52,417
It's really pretty.

530
01:03:52,797 --> 01:03:54,000
It's crazy nice.

531
01:03:54,820 --> 01:03:57,998
Enough looking
and get ready for class.

532
01:03:57,999 --> 01:03:59,709
- Yes, Mr. Lee.
- Yes, Mr. Lee.

533
01:04:12,667 --> 01:04:16,148
Don't worry, Sua.
Mommy loves you.

534
01:04:48,844 --> 01:04:50,923
Are these three it?

535
01:04:51,334 --> 01:04:52,423
Yes.

536
01:04:53,829 --> 01:04:55,743
Wait, what's wrong with your finger?

537
01:04:55,959 --> 01:04:57,825
Are you sure you can deliver it?

538
01:04:58,334 --> 01:05:01,138
Yeah, it's just a small injury.

539
01:05:39,893 --> 01:05:44,853
Boss, what should I do with the thief?

540
01:05:44,861 --> 01:05:47,334
- Kill 'em.
- Kill...?

541
01:05:48,459 --> 01:05:50,542
Where did you lose
the drug bag again?

542
01:05:50,693 --> 01:05:53,192
Haengbok-dong redevelopment zone.

543
01:06:34,125 --> 01:06:37,042
WALKING ON THIN ICE

544
01:06:38,284 --> 01:06:42,144
{\an8}<i>Do you know
how I survived in this industry?</i>

545
01:06:42,566 --> 01:06:44,113
{\an8}<i>I have no interest in you.</i>

546
01:06:44,394 --> 01:06:47,250
{\an8}<i>All I need to know
is the guy who brought the drugs.</i>

547
01:06:47,292 --> 01:06:50,375
{\an8}<i>I never take risks.</i>

548
01:06:50,827 --> 01:06:52,876
{\an8}<i>I'll do anything.</i>

549
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:55,676
{\an8}<i>Then hand everything over.</i>

550
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:57,126
{\an8}<i>The whole stolen bag.</i>

551
01:06:57,182 --> 01:06:59,792
{\an8}<i>Between my husband's medical bills
and the house mortgage,</i>

552
01:06:59,834 --> 01:07:01,502
{\an8}<i>186.7 million won.</i>

553
01:07:01,518 --> 01:07:02,876
{\an8}<i>That's all I need to get.</i>

554
01:07:03,244 --> 01:07:06,042
{\an8}<i>I'll at least spare your life.</i>

555
01:07:07,209 --> 01:07:10,209
{\an8}<i>Let's just die together, Mr. Lee.</i>
