174
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:24,106
and I don't wanna have
to do that for you.

175
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,402
So the next time you wanna
run off after somebody...

176
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:32,738
[dispatch] <i>All available units respond
to Greenbelt Park, northeast corner.</i>

177
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,492
<i>Bus bench off Spring
Street. Possible homicide.</i>

178
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:39,121
You just do me a favor
and you think it through.

179
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:41,873
4-Charlie-85, five minute ETA.

180
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:05,558
[Mystery Mary] Cops is here.

181
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,775
Oh, hey, hey. Hey,
Officer Harmon!

182
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,027
- Whoa, whoa. Back up.
- Hey, Mary.

183
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:12,778
- No, no. She's harmless.
- Yeah.

184
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,780
Hey, Mary, what happened?

185
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,408
Well, somebody left a
surprise in the park.

186
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:20,119
Okay. Did you ever call
that number that I gave you?

187
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,998
Ah, man. You know, I just got
out of rehab like yesterday.

188
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:26,000
Come on. I gave you that
number like a week ago.

189
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:29,920
And, voila, here I am!
Totally upright and awake.

190
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,423
Glory be to Mother Earth.

191
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:33,090
Hey, who's that guy?

192
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:34,425
Oh, he's my new trainee.

193
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:35,551
Mm, is he cool?

194
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,262
I don't know. Jury's still out.

195
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,681
Hey, Mary, can
you do me a favor?

196
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,059
Can you go wait wherever your tent
is, and I'll come talk to you?

197
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,770
Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah. I
just wanted to let you know

198
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:48,523
that the Sheriff was walking
around here the other day.

199
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:51,360
- Yeah?
- [Mystery Mary] Yeah.

200
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:53,969
Thought you said
you were in rehab.

201
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:57,948
- Hey, she's looking for you!
- Call that number, Mary.

202
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:01,578
- Sheriff?
- Ah, she's so geared up, I don't know.

203
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:05,289
Hey. This is a first.

204
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,540
Is it real?

205
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,958
Poke a finger and find out.

206
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,002
Jesus.

207
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:10,711
Who found it?

208
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:13,589
One of the zombies here.
Somebody called 911.

209
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,673
[Traci] You talk to him?

210
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,761
No. He's all fucked up,
doesn't make much sense.

211
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,433
This is some real serial
killer shit right here.

212
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:23,140
Diaz, what do you think?

213
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,435
Was he murdered here in the
park or is this just a drop?

214
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,606
I'd say drop. [clears throat]
I don't see any blood anywhere.

215
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,191
Hey, what's the matter? You
don't like a little head?

216
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,734
- [laughing]
- Man, come on.

217
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:36,028
Are the detectives on their way?

218
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,447
No. They're tied up.
They've only got two on.

219
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,283
Said they'd be at least 45.

220
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,995
Hey, go find that other rookie,
start searching the park.

221
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:47,289
Diaz, this whole place
is a crime scene.

222
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,416
Okay.

223
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:51,710
Watch the chair. [chuckles]

224
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,295
All right, sir. I
need you to back up.

225
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:54,964
Hey, give me some
space, all right?

226
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:56,132
Yo.

227
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:58,426
There he is. The
Pride of San Pedro.

228
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:00,845
Shit, I'm the <i>mero
mero</i>. Don't forget.

229
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:04,014
Oh, you're a star, that's for sure.
Video from last night is everywhere.

230
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:06,559
Ah, guy went full
Tyson Fury on you.

231
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,185
Yeah, well, he ran
before I could grab him.

232
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:11,230
You know that chasing bad guys
is part of the job description?

233
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:14,316
Oh yeah? I guess you gotta
define "bad guys" these days.

234
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,570
- [grunting]
- [man] Hey! Hey! Give it to me!

235
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:18,112
Hey!

236
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,199
[Alex] Hey, back up!
Break it up! Break it up!

237
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:23,909
- They're trying to steal my bag.
- [Alex] Why do they want it?

238
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,910
'Cause they want what's in it.

239
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,245
- Show it to him.
- Let him see it.

240
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,621
- Sir, can I see?
- [man] No, no, no.

241
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,957
We're conducting an investigation.
Technically, we can take it.

242
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,625
He's just spooked,
okay? He's just spooked.

243
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:34,379
[spits] I ain't scared of you.

244
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:36,505
Dude, I just shined these!

245
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,090
I guess we got our first
customer of the day.

246
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,092
Hold up, hold up.
What's the deal?

247
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,178
- [Holt] This guy assaulted Diaz.
- No, he didn't assault me.

248
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:44,323
- There's something in his backpack.
- Okay, let him go.

249
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:45,473
All right? Hey, sir?

250
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:47,016
I'm sorry. We're just trying
to figure out what happened.

251
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:48,434
Have you seen anything unusual?

252
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:49,810
Show her. Show her
what you found.

253
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,729
Okay. We got him.
Thank you, thank you.

254
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:52,897
Can I take a quick peek?

255
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:54,231
No. I don't want to open it.

256
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:55,232
Why not?

257
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,402
I don't want the
coyotes to get it.

258
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,278
Okay.

259
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:02,156
I'll tell you what. If you
just let me take a quick look,

260
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:03,909
I'm gonna give you a prize.

261
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:05,660
A date with you?

262
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:09,122
Pretty close. How about if I
make you my deputy for the day?

263
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,542
- Okay. Okay.
- Yeah?

264
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:15,170
- Just a peek.
- Okay.

265
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:20,841
- Interesting.
- [Alex] What is it?

266
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:23,677
I got woke up last night
by the coyotes fighting.

267
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,429
That's when I found it.

268
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,558
It was like I was
chosen or something.

269
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:33,312
Yes. You definitely were. And this
is a very important discovery,

270
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,065
xso I'm gonna need to
hold on to it, okay?

271
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:38,817
But, hey, I promise I'm gonna
keep it safe from the coyotes.

272
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:39,818
Okay, Deputy?

273
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:42,905
Okay.

274
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:44,616
- Great.
- Okay.

275
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:49,662
[man] Hey, guys, check
it out. I got a sticker.

276
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,373
What does that ink
look like to you?

277
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,918
Jesus.

278
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:00,882
Judging by that, looks like somebody
cliqued up with East Barrio.

279
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:04,802
Okay.

280
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:06,971
We're gonna preserve
this for the detectives.

281
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:10,100
And start interviewing these people.
This did not just fall from the sky.

282
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:16,231
I'll call you when
I have more answers.

283
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,233
- Lieutenant.
- Harmon, what do you got?

284
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:22,444
A hand that likely belongs to our victim.
I think we can pull a print from it.

285
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:26,156
Okay. We're gonna need warrants
for every one of these tents.

286
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:28,617
It's a waste of time. I'd
start by notifying Gangs.

287
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,828
I think one of them might have
taken a lesson from the cartel...

288
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:32,705
cut up our victim and
served him to the coyotes.

289
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:33,747
That's not their M.O.

290
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:35,958
Well, M.O.'s change when you're
trying to make a statement,

291
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:37,459
and this is big
fucking statement.

292
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,836
Okay. I'll let the
detectives know.

293
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:40,504
Where are we on
Delgado's killer?

294
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:41,839
I'd tell you if
we had something.

295
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,549
Well, what about the
girl? Any ID on her?

296
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,968
- Not yet.
- Jesus. What are they doing?

297
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:48,762
Ma'am, respectfully,
just let me help them.

298
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:51,123
All right? I'm more plugged in
to East Barrio than they are.

299
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,185
You and your rookie went
off like an unguided missile

300
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:57,022
and let the shooter
get away, remember?

301
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,482
I know you wanna
get them. We all do.

302
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,192
But let the task
force do their job.

303
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:03,527
You could've put me
on the task force.

304
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:04,863
I need you on patrol.

305
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:10,784
[dispatch] <i>Narcotics Unit requesting
backup on suspicious vehicle.</i>

306
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,953
<i>West Anaheim Avenue
and Oregon Street.</i>

307
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:15,539
Charlie-85, we'll take
it. Three minute ETA.

308
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,540
Diaz!

309
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:30,263
Hey, what do you got, gentlemen?

310
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:34,558
There she is. We're Code 4.
Our second unit beat you here.

311
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,727
Come on. You need
any help wrapping up?

312
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:38,271
Nah, we're set.

313
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,357
Heard someone lost their
head in Greenbelt Park.

314
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:44,109
Lost a lot more than that.
We just came from there.

315
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,153
What did you get here?

316
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:47,029
Twenty racks.

317
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,430
Found it under the driver's seat
with a few ounces of powder.

318
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,660
Just looking for
the last ingredient.

319
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,453
There's always a gun.

320
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:54,954
Who trained you so well?

321
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,002
By the tats, I'd say they're
runners for L.B. Flores.

322
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:03,962
How's your rookie?

323
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:07,258
Uh, I don't know. We'll see.

324
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,969
He's got potential, but he
needs to pick his battles.

325
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,638
Karma's a bitch, huh?

326
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:15,684
Fuck you. I was the best
trainee you ever had.

327
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:18,937
Can I talk to them?

328
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:20,646
[Koy] About?

329
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:22,065
Delgado's murder.

330
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:25,819
Come on. Just two minutes.

331
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,698
I'll deny it if anyone asks.

332
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:31,365
Thank you.

333
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:34,827
Hey.

334
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,082
You know these guys?

335
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,293
You seen them around?
They're East Barrio.

336
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:44,753
Come on.

337
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:47,882
If you take a look, I can see
what I can do for you here.

338
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:54,723
Hey. Let me take a swing?

339
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:57,976
Yeah. Can't hurt.

340
