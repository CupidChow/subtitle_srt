2
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:10,260
Have you not heard what
they say about Harmon?

3
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:12,430
You can't trust her. She
got a bunch of cops fired.

4
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:16,391
- Don't move, okay?
- What is it?

5
00:00:16,392 --> 00:00:18,309
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Holt!

6
00:00:19,437 --> 00:00:22,355
Gangs just ID'd Delgado's
shooter. Street name, Maniac.

7
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,732
Is Maniac in Mexico?

8
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:25,233
Stop looking.

9
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:27,110
He said Delgado was
one of your trainees,

10
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:28,791
and that you'd take
her murder the hardest.

11
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,538
Forward arms!

12
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:40,583
Dress right face!

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,961
Aim!

14
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:48,215
Fire!

15
00:01:20,456 --> 00:01:21,499
Hey, Harmon.

16
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,709
You headed over to
the family's house?

17
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,421
No, uh, Watch Commander's expecting
us to clear. I told her we would.

18
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,799
All right. I'll see
you out there, then.

19
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,176
Yeah.

20
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:36,346
I know, I just can't
really get my head around it.

21
00:01:36,347 --> 00:01:38,140
Yeah, I get a...

22
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:42,685
just checking in...

23
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:44,522
You just, you just never know...

24
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:07,711
You okay?

25
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,136
Let's just get some food first.

26
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,481
<i>Gracias.</i>

27
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,990
You know what? I've actually
never seen you drink soda.

28
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:41,202
Well, it's my first time
taking you to my spot, so...

29
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:42,871
consider it a special occasion.

30
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:50,295
Mmm! <i>MÃ¡s chingon!</i>
That's good shit.

31
00:02:50,296 --> 00:02:52,672
How long you been coming here?

32
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,883
Longer than any of
these dipshit foodies.

33
00:02:54,884 --> 00:02:56,885
Chad got robbed,
right when he opened.

34
00:02:56,886 --> 00:03:00,430
And I caught the guy, so he's
been paying me in ribs ever since.

35
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:01,724
Mm.

36
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,270
Jesus, why don't you tell your
girlfriend to give you a break?

37
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:08,313
You are working.

38
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:11,317
It's not my
girlfriend. It's Holt.

39
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,277
How's he doing?

40
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:19,283
HIV test on the needle came back
clean, but his head is all fucked up.

41
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:24,371
Fuck... looks like
he's going on IOD.

42
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:28,291
Hey, you know Holt
wasn't your fault.

43
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,210
- Right?
- Yeah, yeah.

44
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:40,053
Hey, I've been, um... meaning to ask you...

45
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:41,513
- Mm?
- What happened to your sister?

46
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:43,973
My sister?

47
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,726
Yeah, you said
she was a cop. She quit?

48
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,020
Um...

49
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:51,439
No, she was injured
in the line of duty.

50
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,733
It was a high-speed chase.

51
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,152
Um...
and it ended her career.

52
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:57,987
Fuck!

53
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:00,699
Yeah, but she's...
she's okay now, right?

54
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:04,495
Depends on the day.

<i>4:15 domestic dispute, Monterey

Shit never happens
when we're at Chipotle.

57
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:15,588
Never.

58
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,049
Charlie-85, five minute ETA.

59
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,843
- I gotcha. Yep.
- Thanks.

60

Hurry!

61
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:51,332
Piece of shit's gonna kill her.

62
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,709
All right,
go wait over there.

63
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,502
Give me
my fuckin' money!

64
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:56,087
Get the fuck off me!

65
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:57,213
Police! Open up!

66
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,715
You fuckin' hit me!

67
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:00,967
We're coming in either way!

68
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:04,387
- What the fuck do y'all want?!
- Hey, step back.

69
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:06,848
- Back up, back up.
- Bitch burned me!

70
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:09,100
- Okay, everybody sit down!
- I did it in self-defense!

71
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:11,269
Everybody sit down
and shut up. What's your name?

72
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,771
- Liana.
- Liana, that's a very pretty name.

73
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,106
Want to tell me
what's going on here?

74
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:17,859
Bitch burned me!
Look what she did!

75
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,736
- Look what she did to my...
- Hey!

76
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:22,405
Hey, step back, okay! Put
this... Cover yourself.

77
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:23,781
Motherfucker stole my cocaine.

78
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,324
Nah, I paid you!

79
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,994
No, you paid for two
lines, you snorted four!

80
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,620
You snort it, you
gotta pay for it!

81
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:31,205
That's when you burned
him with the rice?

82
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,416
No, I burned him after he slammed
my fuckin' head in the wall!

83
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:36,919
I didn't do that! It was probably
one of the dozen <i>pinche pendejos</i>

84
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,838
- that fucked her before me!
- Okay!

85
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,257
Fuck you, you
two-pump motherfucker!

86
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,426
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Hey, hey, Diaz...

87
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:46,137
I got him, I got him.
Look at me. Look at me.

88
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:47,722
- What do they call you?
- Creeper.

89
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:50,308
Creeper? That's appropriate.
When did you make parole?

90
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:52,101
I walked the line.
Paroled three months ago.

91
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,479
Wow, it took you a whole three
months to violate. I'm impressed.

92
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,855
I'm the victim here!

93
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,858
No, the paraphernalia alone is
enough to bounce you back two times.

94
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,694
You add on assault to that?
That's <i>hasta luego</i>, Creeper.

95
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,197
- Bitch is lying. I didn't hit nobody.
- He's lying.

96
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:07,867
Okay. You know what? Come here, cuff
him. Everybody's going to jail today.

97
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,452
- Turn around.
- Stay right there. Stay right there.

98
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:11,871
Bro, hold up. There's
something you might be interested in.

99
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,123
- Something you want to hear. For real!
- I doubt it.

100
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,625
- For real!
- Gimme your fuckin' hands!

101
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:17,960
There were some fools
from East Barrio earlier,

102
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,713
partying with some girls.
Lot of talking and shit.

103
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:24,342
I heard one of them say that
they're sitting on a hot package.

104
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:25,718
East Barrio?

105
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,678
Killed a cop, right?

106
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,556
Come here, Diaz.

107
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,229
They were talking like
Scarface, or some shit.

108
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,731
They said they were
moving something big.

109
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,734
Welcome to Sodom and Gomorrah.
What the hell do we got here?

110
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,861
A frequent flyer
headed back to jail.

111
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,155
After what I just gave you?!

112
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,951
Never, ever put
hands on a woman.

113
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:52,870
Get him dressed.
Transport him to booking.

114
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:55,748
We'll take the reports when
we get back, all right?

115
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,166
All right, come on.

116
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,626
Get in the car.

117
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:00,670
- Everybody shut up!
- You shut up!

118
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:02,755
I need to run
something past you.

119
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:12,682
So, you don't have anything
with your name and photo on it?

120
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:15,144
I told you,
I don't got no I.D.

121
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:18,980
Please,
watch your head.

122
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:20,274
Watch your head.

123
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:23,652
Yeah. No. Thank you.

124
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:43,045
Liana, you know
any of those girls

125
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,506
who were partying with
the guys from East Barrio?

126
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,383
I keep to myself.

127
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:51,305
Don't waste my
fuckin' time, okay?

128
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,725
If you're smart, you're gonna be outta
here today on a simple possession charge.

129
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:58,812
Be stupid, I'm gonna pile
on assault and sales.

130
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:09,071
Okay. My girl, Baby
Blue, was with 'em.

131
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,656
What's
Blue's real name?

132
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,117
Fuck if I know.

133
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:14,745
She here?

134
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:18,832
Hm?

135
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:25,589
She'll be at Angel Food Donuts
off of Santa Fe around this time.

136
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:29,717
We're goin' for a ride.

137
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:41,020
That package they're
movin'... You think it's dope?

138
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,442
Yeah.

139
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,032
See her?

140
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:57,245
There. Blue shirt, blue
shorts. Can I go now?

141
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:58,872
Sit tight.

142
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:06,963
Afternoon.

143
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:09,340
I'm Officer Harmon,
this is Officer Diaz.

144
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:11,008
Come on, I'm just chilling.

145
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,551
You're not in any
trouble, all right?

146
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,762
A friend said you might
be able to help us out.

147
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,013
What friend?

148
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:19,058
Well, you were partying with some homeboys
from East Barrio at the Monterey Motel,

149
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,143
is that right?

150
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:27,191
All you gotta do
is say yes or no.

151
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:28,318
Was he there?

152
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:35,491
I bet you do all right
outside that uniform.

153
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,076
You'd be disappointed.

154
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,162
Come on, yes or no.

155
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:44,251
You think I want East
Barrio on my ass?

156
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,170
Okay, I'll tell you what.

157
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:52,300
Anybody ever tries to scare you or
if you get jammed up on the streets,

158
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:54,177
you make me your first call.

159
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:06,731
Yeah. He was there.

160
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:10,735
I didn't fuck with him,
okay? He spooked me out.

161
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:14,238
They asked if I wanted to party
tonight and I said no thanks.

162
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,948
At Monterey?

163
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:19,161
Oceanside Motel. Place
past Tam's off the highway.

164
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,337
You know
where to find me...

165
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:30,922
Upstairs!

166
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:35,134
Oh, Jesus, this place is
like a McDonald's drive-thru.

167
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,303
Maybe she
got the motel wrong.

168
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,565
- Whoa, whoa.
- Hm?

169
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,652
Look, you see that Escalade?
Look who it's registered to.

170
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:57,907
Norberto
Vierya, aka Monstro.

171
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:00,242
Gang affiliation, East Barrio.

172
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,328
Holy shit, he's a heavy hitter.

173
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:06,082
Mm-hmm. And I bet he
brought some friends.

174
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,417
Should we call it in?

175
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:14,257
<i>Charlie-33...</i>

176
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:20,304
No, we're gonna go Code Five.

177
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:23,140
But I thought we were supposed to forward
anything on Maniac to the task force.

178
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,893
Yeah, and by the time they get
here, he's probably gonna be gone.

179
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:28,021
I'm not gonna risk
losing him again.

180
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,902
You know what, just hang back.

181
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,822
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, why? Why?

182
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:40,533
I'm not gonna lie, we are a
little bit out of bounds here.

183
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:42,576
All right? And if you are
at all insecure about...

184
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,329
- I never said that...
- Asking if I got cops fired?

185
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,705
Fuck, you're still on that shit.

186
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:50,376
Listen, you are either
100% with me, or not.

187
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,546
Because I can't have
you uncertain here.

188
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:03,640
No, I'm... I'm the one
that let him get away.

189
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:09,563
There's no question...
I'm 100% with you.

190
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:24,327
Wait out here. Keep
your eyes open.

191
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:31,292
Evening, sir. Sir? Can I
have your attention, please?

192
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:33,003
Have you seen this man?

193
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,177
I got my eyes on you!

194
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:42,887
Take a good
look at the photo.

195
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:45,724
Have you seen this man, or a
Hispanic man check in tonight?

196
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:49,185
Fuckin' A, man!

197
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:50,936
Have you seen my cat?

198
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:54,191
No, lady, I haven't seen your
cat. Get back inside your room.

199
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,234
You got an aura around you.

200
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,821
Color of dawn.

201
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:04,409
Please, get back
inside your room.

202
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:08,454
Room 112.

203
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:11,999
Manager said he saw four check in.
They haven't left the room once.

204
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,459
He I.D. Maniac?

205
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,546
No, but my money says that
it's him and three hired guns.

206
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:34,230
Now, we call it in.

207
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:37,900
4-Charlie-85, we are Code
Six at the Oceanside Motel

208
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:42,112
west of Chestnut. Confirmed
Delgado's 187 suspect is on location.

209
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:45,449
Requesting all units, no
lights, no sirens, on Henderson,

210
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,493
south of PCH.

211
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,620
<i>4-Charlie-89 traveling south,</i>

212
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:52,414
<i>Charlie-93 and
Charlie-86 en route.</i>

213
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:56,794
<i>Copy, Charlie-89.
Showing U93 and 86 en route.</i>

214
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:59,672
Dispatch, requesting Air Unit Fox
One. Tell them to keep it high.

215
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:01,048
Do not alert our suspects.

216
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:04,718
<i>Copy. Fox One, five minute
ETA. All units keep the air clear.</i>

217
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,512
<i>Standby for additional
information.</i>

218
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:07,972
Stay by my side.

219
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:09,391
Got it, yeah.

220
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,393
- Look at me.
- Hm?

221
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:15,479
- No fear, no hesitation.
- Mm-hmm.

222
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,607
- No surprise. No doubt.
- Mm-hmm.

223
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,735
Understood. I got you.

224
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,237
Harmon, we need a sec.

225
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:07,573
Feds got good intel that
the kid's in Mexico.

226
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,450
- He's not.
- You know this how?

227
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:10,868
A source.

228
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:12,620
All right, let me talk to 'em.

229
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:14,371
Sir, there's no time.

230
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:16,999
Look, it's an exigent circumstance
with a confirmed cop killer.

231
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,418
You gotta trust me
on this. He's here.

232
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:30,263
All right. It's your
handle. You take lead.

233
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:33,350
Come on.

234
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:38,438
Go inside.

235
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:48,948
Push, push, push...

236
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:52,786
Get inside!

237
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:11,804
LBPD! LBPD!

238
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,350
Front room, clear!

239
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,858
I go, I go.

240
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:31,990
Show me your fuckin' hands!

241
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,248
- Go! Go! Go!
- Next room!

242
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:41,918
- Stay low! Go!
- Get back! Get back!

243
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,757
Don't fuckin' move!

244
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:53,095
Don't fuckin' move!

245
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:54,930
Do not take your
weapon off of him.

246
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,266
Hey! Drop the fucking gun!

247
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:58,601
Fuck the hura!

248
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:02,939
Hey! Hey! Hold them
down, I got him!

249
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,567
Hey! Hands! Give me your
fuckin' hands! Turn around!

250
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,094
Charlie-85 in foot
pursuit of the suspect.

251
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:36,805
At the abandoned Walmart just
south of Oceanside Boulevard.

252
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,141
Requesting backup.

253
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:27,523
Charlie-85 inside of the abandoned
Walmart. Suspect is here.

254
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:29,691
Requesting all
additional units... Ugh!

255
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:22,620
You motherfucker!

256
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,542
Harmon?!

257
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,795
- Harmon!
- Yeah, I'm here!

258
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:35,717
Get over here! Down!

259
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,802
You fuckin' move, I'll
blow your brains out!

260
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,680
You hear me? You
fuckin' hear me?!

261
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:46,727
Talk to me, Harmon! You good?

262
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:48,937
- We good?!
- I'm good, I'm good.

263
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:52,442
Stay there!

264
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:57,487
Charlie-89, suspect
is apprehended.

265
00:19:57,488 --> 00:20:00,074
Send a backup to my 20.

266
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:18,134
When you're up to it, the detectives
are gonna want to talk to you.

267
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:22,555
Do you have anyone who can
meet you at the hospital?

268
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:26,809
No one that matters.

269
00:20:28,186 --> 00:20:29,395
Hey...

270
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,275
I'm gonna come check in on you.

271
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:39,614
Okay.

272
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:06,431
- Hey, nice one.
- Thank you.

273
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,558
When you said you wanted
to run something past me,

274
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,645
I didn't think you
were fuckin' serious.

275
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:14,564
Yeah, you know me.
Never half-speed.

276
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,778
How'd your rookie handle it?

277
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:23,115
Come on.

278
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,243
Like I expected him to.

279
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:28,955
And you?

280
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:34,793
I...

281
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:38,172
From everything I've seen... it's
a clean shooting on your end.

282
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,303
Look... I can't tell
you how to process this,

283
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,306
especially since
this is your first.

284
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:52,145
But you should sleep easy knowing
that piece of shit made his choice.

285
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:14,375
How you holding up?

286
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:19,212
Uh... fine. I think.

287
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:23,217
Well, you've been through a lot tonight,
so we can get into the details later.

288
00:22:24,594 --> 00:22:26,386
But I gotta ask...

289
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:28,681
How'd you know he
was at that motel?

290
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:34,979
I just got lucky, I guess.

291
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:39,900
We got a task force dedicated
to working Delgado's murder,

292
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:42,111
and a patrol cop got lucky?

293
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:51,579
What do you want me to say?

294
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:00,045
I just need to know how to frame it
for the brass when they look into it.

295
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:02,924
If you went off book, you
might want to tell me.

296
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,972
Is this you and me talking?

297
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:13,810
Always.

298
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:27,447
Hey, everybody, listen up. We're
gonna head on over to Ballast Point,

299
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:31,243
get a couple of brews and celebrate
a positive outcome, all right?

300
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:33,453
- We'll see you there.
- Yep.

301
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:35,497
- Hey.
- Hey.

302
00:23:38,376 --> 00:23:40,127
Fitting end to the day.

303
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:41,254
Fuck.

304
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:44,631
Good job.

305
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,718
I appreciate that.

306
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:51,012
Hey, let me ask you a question.

307
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:52,473
Just between me and you.

308
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:56,394
Did you consider taking a shot?

309
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,480
I don't think I
could've held back.

310
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,702
No. I did right by Delgado.

311
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,246
I'm good.

312
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,959
Why don't you roll over
to the Point with us?

313
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,460
Be like the old times.

314
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:25,505
Pfft. Sounds fun,
but I'm gonna pass.

315
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:26,674
Suit yourself.

316
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:35,016
God, don't I drive
your ass around enough?

317
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,769
Hell of a shift, yeah?

318
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,647
Yeah. They don't really prepare
you for that at the Academy, huh?

319
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,942
No, they don't.

320
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:48,613
Yeah, but you did.

321
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:54,117
You're not gonna ride
with everybody else?

322
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:55,452
Not if you're not.

323
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:58,998
Come on, go. You deserve it.

324
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:01,374
You did great.

325
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:07,924
Hey, come on. Let me
buy you a beer. Hm?

326
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:12,928
Maybe a shot...

327
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:16,682
Ugh... yeah, okay.
I'll catch up.

328
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:21,854
- All right.
- Good night.

329
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:33,425
<i>Next on</i> On Call...

330
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:34,926
Gabriel has a hit on his head.

331
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,762
Over what we did.
Grabbing Maniac.

332
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:40,390
We're not going back to Smokey,
so you need to find another angle.

333
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:42,183
I said I see why people
talk shit about you.

334
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,102
- Yeah, why?
- Doesn't have your back.

335
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:45,146
Can't trust her.
