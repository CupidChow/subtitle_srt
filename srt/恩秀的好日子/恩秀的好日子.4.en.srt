You can't trust her. She
got a bunch of cops fired.

- What is it?

He said Delgado was
one of your trainees,

her murder the hardest.

No, uh, Watch Commander's expecting
us to clear. I told her we would.

is that right?

166

All you gotta do
is say yes or no.

Was he there?

00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,170
Okay, I'll tell you what.

173
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:52,300
Anybody ever tries to scare you or
if you get jammed up on the streets,

174
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:54,177
you make me your first call.

175
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:06,731
Yeah. He was there.

176
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:10,735
I didn't fuck with him,
okay? He spooked me out.

177
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:14,238
They asked if I wanted to party
tonight and I said no thanks.

178
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,948
[Alex] At Monterey?

179
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:19,161
Oceanside Motel. Place
past Tam's off the highway.

180
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,337
[woman] You know
where to find me...

181
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:30,922
Upstairs!

182
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:35,134
Oh, Jesus, this place is
like a McDonald's drive-thru.

183
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,303
[Alex] Maybe she
got the motel wrong.

184
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,681
[overlapping chatter]

185
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:42,934

186
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,565
- Whoa, whoa.
- [Alex] Hm?

187
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,652
Look, you see that Escalade?
Look who it's registered to.

188
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:57,907
[Alex] Norberto
Vierya, aka Monstro.

189
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:00,242

190
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,328
Holy shit, he's a heavy hitter.

191
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:06,082
Mm-hmm. And I bet he
brought some friends.

192
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,417
Should we call it in?

193
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:14,257
[on radio] <i>Charlie-33...</i>

194
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:20,304
No, we're gonna go Code Five.

195
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:23,140
But I thought we were supposed to forward
anything on Maniac to the task force.

196
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,893
Yeah, and by the time they get
here, he's probably gonna be gone.

197
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:28,021
I'm not gonna risk
losing him again.

198
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,441
[sighs]

199
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,902
You know what, just hang back.

200
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,822
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, why? Why?

201
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:40,533
I'm not gonna lie, we are a
little bit out of bounds here.

202
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:42,576
All right? And if you are
at all insecure about...

203
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,329
- I never said that...
- Asking if I got cops fired?

204
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,705
Fuck, you're still on that shit.

205
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:50,376
Listen, you are either
100% with me, or not.

206
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,546
Because I can't have
you uncertain here.

207
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:03,640
No, I'm... I'm the one
that let him get away.

208
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:09,563
There's no question...
I'm 100% with you.

209

210
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:24,327
Wait out here. Keep
your eyes open.

211
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:31,292
Evening, sir. Sir? Can I
have your attention, please?

212
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:33,003
Have you seen this man?

213
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,177
[woman in distance]
I got my eyes on you!

214
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:42,887
[Traci] Take a good
look at the photo.

215
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:45,724
Have you seen this man, or a
Hispanic man check in tonight?

216
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:49,185
Fuckin' A, man!

217
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:50,936
Have you seen my cat?

218
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:54,191
No, lady, I haven't seen your
cat. Get back inside your room.

219
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,234
You got an aura around you.

They haven't left the room once.

it's him and three hired guns.

346
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:28,681
How'd you know he
was at that motel?

347
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:34,979
I just got lucky, I guess.

348
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:39,900
We got a task force dedicated
to working Delgado's murder,

349
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:42,111
and a patrol cop got lucky?

350
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:51,579
What do you want me to say?

351
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:55,499
[sighs]

352
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:00,045
I just need to know how to frame it
for the brass when they look into it.

353
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:02,924
If you went off book, you
might want to tell me.

354
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,972
Is this you and me talking?

355
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:13,810
Always.

356
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:22,485
[overlapping chatter]

357
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:27,447
Hey, everybody, listen up. We're
gonna head on over to Ballast Point,

358
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:31,243
get a couple of brews and celebrate
a positive outcome, all right?

359
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:33,453
- We'll see you there.
- Yep.

360
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:35,497
- Hey.
- Hey.

361
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:38,375
[both sigh]

362
00:23:38,376 --> 00:23:40,127
Fitting end to the day.

363
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:41,254
Fuck.

364
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:44,631
Good job.

365
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:46,424
[cars starting]

366
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,718
I appreciate that.

367
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:51,012
Hey, let me ask you a question.

368
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:52,473
Just between me and you.

369
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:56,394
Did you consider taking a shot?

370
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,480
I don't think I
could've held back.

371
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,702
No. I did right by Delgado.

372
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,246
I'm good.

373
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,959
Why don't you roll over
to the Point with us?

374
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,460
Be like the old times.

375
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:25,505
Pfft. Sounds fun,
but I'm gonna pass.

376
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:26,674
Suit yourself.

377
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,885
[sighs]

378
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:35,016
God, don't I drive
your ass around enough?

379
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,769
Hell of a shift, yeah?

380
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,647
Yeah. They don't really prepare
you for that at the Academy, huh?

381
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,942
[chuckles] No, they don't.

382
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:48,613
Yeah, but you did.

383
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:54,117
You're not gonna ride
with everybody else?

384
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:55,452
Not if you're not.

385
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:58,998
Come on, go. You deserve it.

386
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:01,374
You did great.

387
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:02,668
[chuckles]

388
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:07,924
Hey, come on. Let me
buy you a beer. Hm?

389
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:12,928
[speaking Spanish]
Maybe a shot...

390
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:16,682
Ugh... yeah, okay.
I'll catch up.

391
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:21,854
- All right.
- Good night.

392
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:33,783
[car door closes, engine starts]

393
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:51,175
[crying, sniffles]

394
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:33,425
[Traci] <i>Next on</i> On Call...

395
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:34,926
Gabriel has a hit on his head.

396
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,762
Over what we did.
Grabbing Maniac.

397
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:40,390
We're not going back to Smokey,
so you need to find another angle.

398
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:42,183
I said I see why people
talk shit about you.

399
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,102
- Yeah, why?
- Doesn't have your back.

400
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:45,146
Can't trust her.

401
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,149
[theme music playing]
