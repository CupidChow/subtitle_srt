00:00:00,104 --> 00:00:05,077
WALKING ON THIN ICE

2
00:00:05,571 --> 00:00:07,474
PRODUCTION SUPPORTED BY
MINISTRY OF CULTURE, SPORTS AND TOURISM
KOREA CREATIVE CONTENT AGENCY

3
00:00:07,479 --> 00:00:08,819
CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS, INCIDENTS,
AND GROUPS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

4
00:00:08,819 --> 00:00:10,149
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED SAFELY
WITH THEIR GUARDIANS PRESENT.

5
00:00:10,149 --> 00:00:11,472
THE SCENES WITH ANIMALS WERE ALSO FILMED
SAFELY WITH THE ADVICE OF EXPERTS.

6
00:00:11,496 --> 00:00:14,418
DRUG USE ISN’T JUST A MERE DEVIATION BUT A SERIOUS CRIME A SINGLE WRONG
CHOICE CAN DESTROY AN INDIVIDUAL, A FAMILY, AND SOCIETY AS A WHOLE

7
00:00:27,544 --> 00:00:30,149
From the beginning through to now,

8
00:00:31,148 --> 00:00:33,108
it may all have been predestined.

9
00:00:56,904 --> 00:00:58,098
Then versus now...

10
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,974
Which one's worse?

11
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:14,558
One thing's very clear.

12
00:01:15,098 --> 00:01:17,017
Compared to back then,

13
00:01:20,675 --> 00:01:22,466
it's so much easier now.

14
00:03:18,048 --> 00:03:21,048
EPISODE 1

15
00:03:21,675 --> 00:03:24,132
It was announced that
full or partial restrictions

16
00:03:24,174 --> 00:03:26,967
will be in place
from 6 am to 11 am,

17
00:03:27,008 --> 00:03:29,174
and citizens are requested to cooperate.

18
00:03:29,216 --> 00:03:32,549
Darling, are you done washing?

19
00:03:33,424 --> 00:03:36,383
With reports of cryptocurrency
investment fraud continuing daily,

20
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:39,383
authorities urged the public
to be cautious when investing.

21
00:03:40,508 --> 00:03:42,174
Take a seat.
Let's eat.

22
00:03:43,258 --> 00:03:44,758
Are you taking cooking classes?

23
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,258
Your Dad's been losing weight, okay?
He looks like a walking stick.

24
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:51,048
Will you cook the same
if I lose weight?

25
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:53,883
- Sure, but you never lose weight.
- Whatever.

26
00:03:53,925 --> 00:03:55,048
Bon appétit.

27
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:57,049
You barely slept, right?

28
00:03:57,091 --> 00:04:01,047
You kept tossing and turning.
Look how pale you are.

29
00:04:01,048 --> 00:04:03,841
- You're worrying me.
- I'm fine.

30
00:04:03,883 --> 00:04:07,048
The bank people must think
you keep Dad up all night.

31
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:16,356
What? I'm fifteen.
It's a joke, okay?

32
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:19,258
Unbelievable.

33
00:04:20,508 --> 00:04:23,216
Eat up.
We'll talk when you get taller.

34
00:04:23,258 --> 00:04:26,758
- You can have mine, beloved father.
- No chance.

35
00:04:27,091 --> 00:04:28,591
This is way too much.

36
00:04:32,174 --> 00:04:33,967
Bye, Mom.

37
00:04:34,008 --> 00:04:36,758
Sua, hold on a second.

38
00:04:38,591 --> 00:04:40,132
I didn't do makeup.

39
00:04:41,383 --> 00:04:43,048
Schools aren't that strict anymore.

40
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,466
And there...

41
00:04:45,508 --> 00:04:48,258
Alright, there we go.

42
00:04:51,048 --> 00:04:52,280
All pretty now.

43
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,883
I love you.

44
00:04:56,549 --> 00:04:59,341
- Yes, yes. I love you too.
- Love you.

45
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:02,048
- I have to go now.
- Okay, take care.

46
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:04,619
Hey, Sua!

47
00:05:07,323 --> 00:05:09,048
- Bye bye!
- Yeah!

48
00:05:13,048 --> 00:05:15,633
Oh! Hey there, sweetie!

49
00:05:19,341 --> 00:05:21,048
That's for you.

50
00:05:22,675 --> 00:05:24,132
Hey, Sua!

51
00:05:27,048 --> 00:05:29,091
How'd you recognize me so fast?

52
00:05:29,132 --> 00:05:32,841
You're the only one
who wears a knee-length skirt.

53
00:05:32,883 --> 00:05:36,048
And you're the only one
who rides a five-minute walk to school.

54
00:05:37,048 --> 00:05:38,091
It's seven minutes.

55
00:05:39,575 --> 00:05:43,925
Anyway, can't you shorten
that skirt by just an inch?

56
00:05:43,967 --> 00:05:46,549
I'll show you the best place
to get it done.

57
00:05:46,591 --> 00:05:47,591
Mom won't approve.

58
00:05:47,925 --> 00:05:49,591
You're such a mama's girl.

59
00:05:49,633 --> 00:05:52,716
What about you?
You always obey your mom too.

60
00:06:03,758 --> 00:06:05,841
I do it because I'm scared.

61
00:06:05,883 --> 00:06:07,716
But you love your mom.

62
00:06:08,578 --> 00:06:10,242
Everyone loves their mom.

63
00:06:10,335 --> 00:06:12,048
No, I don't.

64
00:06:12,242 --> 00:06:14,216
How can you say that?

65
00:06:18,048 --> 00:06:20,047
Hey! Why aren't you
answering the phone?

66
00:06:20,048 --> 00:06:23,508
The cops are on us.
Grab the cash and get out, now!

67
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,091
The Phantoms are on us too.
We'll die if we get caught!

68
00:06:54,672 --> 00:06:56,508
Wow, you're really something.

69
00:06:56,549 --> 00:07:00,258
How can you be so accurate
without measuring the scale?

70
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,341
Is it because you were a banker?

71
00:07:02,591 --> 00:07:05,048
Anyone can do it
after a month on the job.

72
00:07:05,136 --> 00:07:09,466
Really? But I've been here six months...

73
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:12,047
Oh, by the way!

74
00:07:12,048 --> 00:07:15,048
I heard your neighborhood's
getting redeveloped. Congrats.

75
00:07:16,048 --> 00:07:19,466
That only concerns
real estate speculators.

76
00:07:19,508 --> 00:07:21,591
It's got nothing to do
with people like me.

77
00:07:21,758 --> 00:07:25,679
Look, I don't need billions.
My dream is to have a small place

78
00:07:25,724 --> 00:07:27,557
to live with my family.

79
00:07:28,617 --> 00:07:33,383
Wait, haven't you already achieved that?

80
00:07:33,767 --> 00:07:35,351
You're living your dream.

81
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,411
OFF-SHAPE APPLES
15,900 WON FOR 3KG

82
00:07:43,048 --> 00:07:45,216
Stupid cops!
They almost ran him over!

83
00:07:45,703 --> 00:07:46,786
Gosh, that was close.

84
00:07:49,263 --> 00:07:52,800
You're done already,
even without Donghyun?

85
00:07:52,912 --> 00:07:54,299
So how many kilos in total?

86
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:59,508
Well, 39 bundles at 3kg each,
so just under 120kg.

87
00:07:59,549 --> 00:08:03,466
Amazing, you're a human calculator.

88
00:08:03,508 --> 00:08:05,216
- And the order?
- Already done.

89
00:08:05,258 --> 00:08:09,445
Mister, we have a delivery.
20kg of cabbage to Daepo Restaurant.

90
00:08:09,552 --> 00:08:12,259
- 20kg? Got it.
- Yes.

91
00:08:13,883 --> 00:08:16,836
Oh, I put your takeaway
at the counter.

92
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:19,167
Aw, thank you!

93
00:08:21,165 --> 00:08:22,917
Hey, crackheads!

94
00:08:23,841 --> 00:08:25,091
Hurry up, quick!

95
00:08:25,132 --> 00:08:28,174
Hey, stop-stop.
Put it down, put it down.

96
00:08:29,369 --> 00:08:30,870
Stay away, bastard!

97
00:08:42,048 --> 00:08:43,341
No, you don't.

98
00:08:54,736 --> 00:08:57,112
Enough running already.

99
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:16,345
Stay put.

100
00:09:24,328 --> 00:09:25,829
Alright, alright, alright.

101
00:09:50,732 --> 00:09:52,466
Damn, what a pain.

102
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:57,132
Mr. Crackhead, you have the right
to remain silent.

103
00:09:57,174 --> 00:09:59,047
You may hire a lawyer,

104
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:04,216
and anything you say
can be used against you in court.

105
00:10:06,286 --> 00:10:07,286
College students?

106
00:10:08,883 --> 00:10:10,442
Do your parents know?

107
00:10:11,723 --> 00:10:13,536
That their kids wish
to become drug lords?

108
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:15,758
How dare you

109
00:10:17,048 --> 00:10:19,258
show up here

110
00:10:20,368 --> 00:10:21,703
to buy stolen drugs?

111
00:10:22,716 --> 00:10:23,716
Huh?

112
00:10:25,048 --> 00:10:27,174
Damn, where is it?

113
00:10:27,925 --> 00:10:29,591
Check outside too.

114
00:10:31,439 --> 00:10:32,917
- Detective.
- Yeah.

115
00:10:34,048 --> 00:10:36,675
From now on,
just stay in the office, okay?

116
00:10:36,716 --> 00:10:37,967
You screw up every time!

117
00:10:38,048 --> 00:10:40,633
If it wasn't for him,
we would've lost them all.

118
00:10:40,675 --> 00:10:42,800
Forget it, alright?

119
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:47,202
You even quit med school
because blood scared you.

120
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:52,758
Sir, the money is right here.

121
00:10:54,284 --> 00:10:55,800
- Sir.
- What?

122
00:10:55,924 --> 00:10:57,758
They don't have any drugs.

123
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,048
Bastards, where's the drug bag?

124
00:11:12,132 --> 00:11:16,091
Shit. These bastards
are driving me crazy.

125
00:11:16,132 --> 00:11:18,925
Give me a break,
you Phantom bastards!

126
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:20,675
Junhyun, get closer.

127
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:23,008
Where the hell is he going?

128
00:11:23,048 --> 00:11:25,466
- Stop the car!
- Shut your damn mouth!

129
00:11:25,508 --> 00:11:28,048
You fucking traitor!
Stop right now!

130
00:11:28,633 --> 00:11:30,048
Where are you going, bitch?

131
00:11:34,299 --> 00:11:38,675
- Stop the car! Stop, you bastard!
- Screw you, damn Phantoms!

132
00:11:38,716 --> 00:11:39,800
Kim Bongnam, that bastard!

133
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,705
Junhyun...

134
00:12:20,299 --> 00:12:21,383
Time to fuck off.

135
00:12:24,048 --> 00:12:26,675
Argh, seriously?

136
00:12:32,716 --> 00:12:36,351
No, fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

137
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:39,675
Hey, hey! Get your ass out!

138
00:12:39,716 --> 00:12:41,258
Fine, I'll give it back.
Here, here.

139
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:42,800
Get out!

140
00:12:42,841 --> 00:12:44,466
Get the fuck out!

141
00:12:45,048 --> 00:12:47,383
- Just smash it.
- Smash everything!

142
00:12:51,048 --> 00:12:52,716
Alright, alright.
Here.

143
00:12:52,758 --> 00:12:55,424
Enough, enough, enough!

144
00:12:55,466 --> 00:12:58,048
Shit. Put that down.
Hey, hey!

145
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:03,841
- Catch him!
- Stop, Bongnam!

146
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:07,549
- Stop that thief!
- The bag! Get the bag!

147
00:13:08,174 --> 00:13:10,466
You're dead meat, bitch!

148
00:13:12,549 --> 00:13:15,048
Stop right there!

149
00:13:15,383 --> 00:13:18,049
Stop right there!
I said stop!

150
00:13:18,341 --> 00:13:19,716
Shut the fuck up!

151
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,591
Hand over the bag!

152
00:13:40,716 --> 00:13:45,047
What's causing the recent surge
in drug crimes among people?

153
00:13:45,048 --> 00:13:50,883
Today's guest is Lt. Song Jeongseon
from the Seoul Police Drug Crimes Unit,

154
00:13:50,925 --> 00:13:53,317
and we'll be talking about
drug crimes among ordinary people.

155
00:13:53,341 --> 00:13:57,578
Nearly 800 suspects were arrested
just last month alone.

156
00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:00,967
It has literally spread
into our everyday surroundings.

157
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:02,716
What do you think is the cause?

158
00:14:03,074 --> 00:14:05,341
Online distribution
has become more active.

159
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:08,549
Drugs now have much easier access.

160
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:12,800
Anyone can search online
and order drugs like food delivery...

161
00:14:12,841 --> 00:14:14,466
SAERO GIRLS' MIDDLE SCHOOL

162
00:14:57,925 --> 00:15:01,049
- Hi.
- Good afternoon.

163
00:15:03,132 --> 00:15:06,216
You girls came way too early again.

164
00:15:07,883 --> 00:15:09,841
And your makeup keep getting thicker.

165
00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:16,383
Put just as much
effort into drawing, okay?

166
00:15:16,424 --> 00:15:17,424
- Okay.
- Okay.

167
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:26,831
Ah, I thought I barely ate...

168
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:29,315
Honey, any antacids at home?

169
00:15:36,048 --> 00:15:38,466
NOTICE OF FORCED SEIZURE OF MOVABLE ASSETS

170
00:15:40,204 --> 00:15:41,247
What happened?

171
00:15:46,048 --> 00:15:49,716
MORTGAGE LOAN

172
00:15:53,383 --> 00:15:54,800
Crypto?

173
00:15:55,216 --> 00:15:57,758
You even got a loan against the house?

174
00:15:58,591 --> 00:15:59,883
How much?

175
00:16:00,867 --> 00:16:02,758
Don't tell me you lost everything.

176
00:16:03,325 --> 00:16:04,909
Say something!

177
00:16:09,356 --> 00:16:10,398
I'm sorry.

178
00:16:10,476 --> 00:16:14,091
Wha... What were you thinking?

179
00:16:14,297 --> 00:16:17,132
Did I ever tell you
to earn more money?

180
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:20,047
Have I ever nagged you
for never being promoted?

181
00:16:20,048 --> 00:16:22,299
Or for co-signing a friend's debt,

182
00:16:22,341 --> 00:16:25,132
or helping your brother buy his house!
Did I say anything?

183
00:16:25,338 --> 00:16:28,880
I was okay with them
because it's in your nature to help.

184
00:16:29,648 --> 00:16:33,148
All I wanted was just this...

185
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:36,383
To protect what we already have.
But how could you?

186
00:16:39,445 --> 00:16:43,110
We're short on money
for the additional deposit as it is.

187
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,567
But now, our house is going up
for auction!

188
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:49,341
Where will we live then?

189
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,450
What about Sua?

190
00:16:53,841 --> 00:16:55,028
Are you even her father?

191
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,583
Are you really my husband?

192
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,813
Eunsoo, Eunsoo!

193
00:17:08,687 --> 00:17:11,104
For the first time,
I actually regret marrying you.

194
00:17:21,383 --> 00:17:24,967
2014 HAPPY BANK FALL OUTING

195
00:17:33,425 --> 00:17:36,216
So that's why you ran away?

196
00:17:38,703 --> 00:17:42,786
Today, I just couldn't bear
to even look at him.

197
00:17:47,716 --> 00:17:48,996
You'll let me sleep over, right?

198
00:17:49,048 --> 00:17:52,048
Of course, I will.

199
00:17:53,008 --> 00:17:57,216
Don't you dare go back
in a few hours to make breakfast.

200
00:17:58,008 --> 00:18:00,925
Gosh, what am I gonna do?

201
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,466
I have no idea...

202
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:14,216
I'll look into employee loans tomorrow.

203
00:18:14,258 --> 00:18:18,216
You'll be able to get twenty million won.

204
00:18:18,258 --> 00:18:19,549
Thanks.

205
00:18:19,591 --> 00:18:21,716
Why did your husband do that?

206
00:18:21,758 --> 00:18:25,183
He's not the type to invest recklessly.

207
00:18:26,008 --> 00:18:27,466
I really don't get it.

208
00:19:02,853 --> 00:19:03,822
Honey?

209
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:06,478
Sua?

210
00:19:15,675 --> 00:19:17,841
Where did they go off to?

211
00:19:21,967 --> 00:19:23,258
Mom, what's wrong?

212
00:19:28,049 --> 00:19:29,299
Dad!

213
00:19:30,132 --> 00:19:31,967
- Honey!
- What should we do?

214
00:19:32,008 --> 00:19:33,091
Honey!

215
00:19:43,174 --> 00:19:45,466
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma?

216
00:19:45,508 --> 00:19:49,047
The tumor has invaded the vessels
around the pancreas.

217
00:19:49,048 --> 00:19:51,292
Unfortunately,
surgery won't be possible.

218
00:19:51,401 --> 00:19:53,048
Things might have been better

219
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:56,383
if he started chemo
when he was diagnosed last May.

220
00:19:56,424 --> 00:19:58,883
- But at this point...
- Last May?

221
00:20:00,174 --> 00:20:01,925
Are you saying my husband knew?

222
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:06,319
Well, pancreatic cancer treatment
is expensive and risky.

223
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:10,508
There are many patients
who delay or don't tell their families.

224
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:15,216
Has he recently lost a lot of weight,
looked yellow in the face,

225
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:18,132
or collapsed from
stomach pain like today?

226
00:20:24,883 --> 00:20:29,049
If it spreads to his liver or brain,
there's virtually no hope.

227
00:20:29,508 --> 00:20:34,800
He must be admitted right away
and get treated.

228
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:46,967
Eunsoo, I checked
the company loan status.

229
00:20:47,008 --> 00:20:49,047
Your husband already took his at max.

230
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:51,132
He took it last summer,
didn't you know?

231
00:20:54,048 --> 00:20:57,174
Hello? Eunsoo?

232
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,925
Oh my God...

233
00:21:56,925 --> 00:22:01,716
Why would you make breakfast
in that condition?

234
00:22:03,048 --> 00:22:08,758
You're driving me crazy here.
Dear Lord...

235
00:22:09,675 --> 00:22:11,048
Gosh...

236
00:22:19,716 --> 00:22:23,883
I have to clean this up too?

237
00:22:27,758 --> 00:22:32,925
PANCREATIC DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA

238
00:22:32,967 --> 00:22:36,048
PANCREATIC CANCER,
THE SECOND MOST EXPENSIVE CANCER

239
00:22:38,265 --> 00:22:41,084
THE AVERAGE TREATMENT COST FOR
PANCREATIC CANCER IS ABOUT 62 MILLION WON

240
00:22:41,177 --> 00:22:44,058
MUCH OF IT ISN’T COVERED
BY NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE

241
00:22:53,925 --> 00:22:58,048
Abdominal CT, MRI, PET-CT,
endoscopic ultrasound...

242
00:22:58,591 --> 00:23:00,491
Metal stent procedure,
and hemostatic

243
00:23:00,503 --> 00:23:02,716
injections... That
totals to 1,031,500 won.

244
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:07,841
There's a discount for
severe cancer patients, right?

245
00:23:07,883 --> 00:23:09,048
It's already been applied.

246
00:23:18,048 --> 00:23:20,091
- Paying in installments?
- Yes, six months.

247
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,450
I can give you your pay
in advance, don't worry.

248
00:23:33,258 --> 00:23:35,008
- Thank you
- Hang in there.

249
00:23:35,048 --> 00:23:38,008
I heard about Dojin,
but my situation's tight too.

250
00:23:38,048 --> 00:23:43,258
I know it's a lot to ask,
but is there no way?

251
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:46,675
Sorry, I have a meeting to attend.

252
00:23:56,048 --> 00:23:59,841
He has to start
chemotherapy right away.

253
00:24:00,591 --> 00:24:04,424
If you could help out
your brother a little,

254
00:24:04,466 --> 00:24:08,216
it would mean a lot.
Just a little help...

255
00:24:08,716 --> 00:24:11,091
Stay strong, Eunsoo.
I'll find a way...

256
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,750
Yes, stay strong.

257
00:24:29,816 --> 00:24:31,047
Seriously?

258
00:24:31,048 --> 00:24:32,299
Only a million won?

259
00:24:32,511 --> 00:24:34,048
Wow...

260
00:24:34,448 --> 00:24:37,758
His brother is about to die, and his
niece is about to become homeless!

261
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,341
They even took
the entire family inheritance.

262
00:24:41,383 --> 00:24:45,258
You also gave them tens of millions of won
for their real estate purchase!

263
00:24:45,456 --> 00:24:48,048
How can they be so shameless?

264
00:24:53,716 --> 00:24:58,675
Hey! What about his school friends?
Don't they owe him a lot?

265
00:25:01,883 --> 00:25:03,048
Same story.

266
00:25:06,244 --> 00:25:09,675
Wow... Those shameless bastards!

267
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:12,008
Hey, calm down.

268
00:25:12,048 --> 00:25:15,216
I'm just so upset.
That's why!

269
00:25:15,455 --> 00:25:20,508
He started small and was doing well.
So he got a loan to invest more.

270
00:25:21,048 --> 00:25:24,638
To leave behind some money
in case he died.

271
00:25:24,758 --> 00:25:26,508
That's not an excuse.

272
00:25:27,216 --> 00:25:29,048
I just need 200 million.

273
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:33,591
No more, no less.
Just 200 mil.

274
00:25:42,883 --> 00:25:46,153
I wish a bag of cash
fell from the sky.

275
00:25:51,274 --> 00:25:52,274
What's this?

276
00:25:53,967 --> 00:25:57,549
Sorry, it's only a million won.

277
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:17,008
Your million is different
from my brother-in-law's...

278
00:26:17,468 --> 00:26:19,633
I wanted to give you more.

279
00:26:20,048 --> 00:26:22,398
But my brother's gym
went bankrupt, remember?

280
00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:28,503
So you've been covering
his living expenses?

281
00:26:28,565 --> 00:26:29,967
Yeah, I hate blood ties.

282
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:33,971
But he got a job recently though.
I was surprised.

283
00:26:35,048 --> 00:26:37,299
But he's still a trash.

284
00:26:37,553 --> 00:26:41,022
He wants me to work
part-time in a kitchen.

285
00:26:41,342 --> 00:26:42,925
And give him the money.

286
00:26:43,216 --> 00:26:44,299
Hey...

287
00:26:44,758 --> 00:26:47,885
Do they give salaries in advance?

288
00:26:47,924 --> 00:26:50,424
It's a club.
You're a mother, remember?

289
00:26:50,466 --> 00:26:54,091
Come on, I can do anything
for my family.

290
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,466
The auction will proceed within two weeks.

291
00:27:17,931 --> 00:27:21,048
We'll inform you of
the exact date and time later.

292
00:27:28,466 --> 00:27:30,466
- Eat before you go.
- I don't want breakfast.

293
00:27:31,301 --> 00:27:32,466
Sua!

294
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:34,925
Sua!

295
00:28:09,758 --> 00:28:10,758
Delivery!

296
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:29,937
Who is it?

297
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:33,273
Oh, you answered.
I was about to leave this and go.

298
00:28:33,351 --> 00:28:37,174
Great, it's best to eat
while it's still hot.

299
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:40,194
- Leave.
- Yup, have a good one.

300
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,048
Sorry, I forgot the pickled radish.

301
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:10,508
Fucking bastard.

302
00:29:16,132 --> 00:29:17,383
You annoying shit...

303
00:29:21,758 --> 00:29:27,048
Hey, Bongnam. Your phone's off, and
you don't use credit cards. But for what?

304
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:31,048
You used a delivery app to order, dumbass.

305
00:29:37,758 --> 00:29:40,424
Oh, you guys are cops!

306
00:29:43,466 --> 00:29:45,800
Wait, hold on a sec.

307
00:29:46,216 --> 00:29:48,466
Don't come near me!
Stay away!

308
00:29:48,971 --> 00:29:50,012
Stay away!

309
00:29:56,048 --> 00:29:59,424
Ah, that tickles.
That tickles!

310
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:01,758
Eat this!

311
00:30:09,049 --> 00:30:10,841
Wow, it's so damn high!

312
00:30:11,549 --> 00:30:14,049
Hey, do you know who I am?

313
00:30:15,048 --> 00:30:17,047
I'm Superman!

314
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:19,341
What a pain in the ass.

315
00:30:20,675 --> 00:30:23,591
Ah, my leg's broken.

316
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,841
Bye, now.

317
00:30:27,716 --> 00:30:28,925
Hey, Kim Bongnam!

318
00:30:30,048 --> 00:30:31,048
Getting comfortable?

319
00:30:40,008 --> 00:30:41,258
Gotcha!

320
00:30:44,925 --> 00:30:46,174
Crazy bitch.

321
00:30:50,841 --> 00:30:52,048
Stop!

322
00:30:54,174 --> 00:30:56,216
Get him already!

323
00:30:59,341 --> 00:31:03,758
DESIGNATED REDEVELOPMENT ZONE

324
00:31:06,478 --> 00:31:12,258
My husband is Park Dojin.
He should have cancer insurance.

325
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:17,262
I'm sorry,
but he terminated it last fall

326
00:31:17,345 --> 00:31:19,345
and already took the refund.

327
00:31:21,148 --> 00:31:23,481
No, that can't be.

328
00:31:25,048 --> 00:31:28,925
Never mind, I must've forgotten.

329
00:31:30,132 --> 00:31:35,716
What about my life insurance?

330
00:31:39,227 --> 00:31:40,074
Yes...

331
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,384
Would you like to cancel it?

332
00:31:45,048 --> 00:31:46,383
Oh, no.

333
00:31:46,424 --> 00:31:52,048
How much is the payout
upon death again?

334
00:31:58,336 --> 00:31:59,784
It shows as 100 million won.

335
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,097
100 million...

336
00:32:09,048 --> 00:32:11,633
Ma'am? Ma'am?

337
00:32:12,091 --> 00:32:19,800
Oh, sorry about that.
I'll call you back, thanks.

338
00:32:24,132 --> 00:32:25,341
Ouch...

339
00:32:27,716 --> 00:32:29,048
Argh...

340
00:32:29,883 --> 00:32:31,048
Ah, that hurts...

341
00:32:45,049 --> 00:32:46,549
Is anyone there?

342
00:32:47,172 --> 00:32:48,382
Anyone home?

343
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:05,341
What is this about?

344
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,048
JANG TAEGU

345
00:33:07,049 --> 00:33:11,048
Police, we need your cooperation.

346
00:33:31,424 --> 00:33:33,675
- Not up there?
- We got nothing.

347
00:33:34,883 --> 00:33:35,967
Did you search properly?

348
00:33:37,341 --> 00:33:40,174
- Any signs?
- No, nothing.

349
00:33:43,675 --> 00:33:46,049
Split up and search.

350
00:33:46,091 --> 00:33:48,132
You two go up there.
You're with me.

351
00:33:52,258 --> 00:33:54,633
What was the house address again?

352
00:33:54,675 --> 00:33:57,049
33-gil? 34-gil?

353
00:33:57,091 --> 00:33:59,850
Bongnam, get your head straight!

354
00:34:01,048 --> 00:34:02,048
What's wrong?

355
00:34:02,049 --> 00:34:06,916
That man sure walks
like someone I know.

356
00:34:07,002 --> 00:34:11,174
32-gil 55.32-gil 55.
32-gil 55.

357
00:34:11,509 --> 00:34:14,466
32-gil 55, 32-gil 55...

358
00:34:14,508 --> 00:34:15,841
Bongnam!

359
00:34:39,668 --> 00:34:42,508
I'm sure there's
a bigger bag somewhere...

360
00:35:00,329 --> 00:35:01,829
Jump!

361
00:35:03,971 --> 00:35:06,248
Eat this, you damn cop.

362
00:35:18,967 --> 00:35:21,048
Bring it.
I'll smash your head open.

363
00:35:32,008 --> 00:35:34,258
There you are.

364
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:37,216
Stop following me already.

365
00:35:43,898 --> 00:35:45,522
Strike!

366
00:35:48,048 --> 00:35:49,675
Little rat.

367
00:35:50,005 --> 00:35:51,964
Bongnam, let's go home.

368
00:35:55,675 --> 00:35:58,258
Don't move!
This is a real gun! Stay away!

369
00:35:59,048 --> 00:36:01,132
- Calm down, man.
- Stay away!

370
00:36:01,174 --> 00:36:02,675
Catch me if you can.

371
00:36:02,716 --> 00:36:04,048
- Quit it.
- I'm Superman!

372
00:36:08,216 --> 00:36:09,216
Hey, hey!

373
00:36:29,703 --> 00:36:31,078
Is he... dead?

374
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:35,048
Sir... Sir?

375
00:36:35,883 --> 00:36:37,483
- No drugs...
- You shouldn't touch him.

376
00:36:38,424 --> 00:36:40,048
Where are the drugs, you bastard!

377
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,591
Huh?

378
00:37:00,258 --> 00:37:02,508
Where did this come from?

379
00:37:27,383 --> 00:37:32,008
Around 5:30 pm today in the redevelopment
zone at Haengbok-dong, Gwangnam...

380
00:37:32,048 --> 00:37:35,383
By the way, this golf bag.
Is it yours?

381
00:37:36,048 --> 00:37:38,258
It was full of strange things.

382
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:41,047
Kim was a member of
the Phantom drug trafficking gang.

383
00:37:41,048 --> 00:37:44,091
Police said Phantom recently smuggled
10kg of meth from Southeast Asia...

384
00:37:44,132 --> 00:37:47,800
- It's not mine.
- Really? It's not Sua's either.

385
00:37:47,841 --> 00:37:49,299
Then where did it come from?

386
00:37:49,341 --> 00:37:52,591
Police succeeded in recovering the body.

387
00:37:52,633 --> 00:37:55,633
- But they failed to obtain the meth...
- Huh? Wait.

388
00:37:55,675 --> 00:37:57,258
- which he had fled with.
- Why?

389
00:37:57,299 --> 00:38:02,591
Police are backtracking Kim's
escape route for the meth bag.

390
00:38:02,633 --> 00:38:08,310
This crystallized drug resembles ice,
and thus is called 'Ice' or 'Crystal'.

391
00:38:08,424 --> 00:38:11,048
It was recently
smuggled in from Vietnam.

392
00:38:11,675 --> 00:38:14,091
Based in clubs around Gwangnam,

393
00:38:14,132 --> 00:38:17,675
the Phantom drug gang
has recently grown rapidly.

394
00:38:17,716 --> 00:38:21,883
Unlike the gangs of the past, they
operated virtually and in small cells.

395
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:26,341
Their true identity is hidden,
hence the name Phantom.

396
00:38:26,383 --> 00:38:29,048
- It looks like a candy.
- The cautiously operating gang

397
00:38:29,049 --> 00:38:33,758
recently left behind a trail
due to their gang member, Kim Bongnam.

398
00:38:34,424 --> 00:38:39,466
The police got intel about
10kg of meth being smuggled in,

399
00:38:39,508 --> 00:38:41,048
and surveilled Kim.

400
00:38:42,008 --> 00:38:47,633
The 10kg of meth had come in
from Vietnam a week ago.

401
00:38:47,675 --> 00:38:51,800
A taxi driver reported on Kim
for acting weird in the back seat

402
00:38:51,841 --> 00:38:56,049
and being suspicious
while carrying a heavy bag.

403
00:38:56,728 --> 00:39:02,047
Kim used the subway and the bus
from Seoul to Incheon...

404
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,508
I don't feel anything.

405
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:09,675
Don't overthink it.
There's no drug in this neighborhood.

406
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:13,633
Police traced back
the delivery app Kim used

407
00:39:13,675 --> 00:39:16,341
and raided the motel where Kim was hiding.

408
00:39:16,383 --> 00:39:20,761
After recklessly jumping off
a building in an attempt to escape,

409
00:39:20,862 --> 00:39:23,154
Kim eventually ended up dead.

410
00:39:23,885 --> 00:39:25,596
- Kim betrayed the gang...
- It looks the same!

411
00:39:25,635 --> 00:39:30,091
and tried to steal the drugs
with his acquaintances.

412
00:39:30,132 --> 00:39:35,424
Holy! Are these actually real?

413
00:39:36,967 --> 00:39:39,132
But how did it end up here?

414
00:39:41,383 --> 00:39:44,383
Wait a second...
Who brought it here?

415
00:40:04,132 --> 00:40:06,758
Hold on, think.

416
00:40:08,925 --> 00:40:10,883
while stealing drugs and running away.

417
00:40:12,177 --> 00:40:16,591
We can see how deeply
drugs have infiltrated our daily lives.

418
00:40:17,258 --> 00:40:19,492
Trades by tossing
happen in residential areas.

419
00:40:19,531 --> 00:40:21,211
Calm down.

420
00:40:21,234 --> 00:40:27,424
The ones doing the tossing are
students, housewives,

421
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:31,341
and ordinary people
who'll avoid suspicion.

422
00:40:32,455 --> 00:40:36,416
Meanwhile, the Phantom
drug trafficking gang...

423
00:40:36,463 --> 00:40:40,967
- has earned over 200 million won a month.
- 911, what's your emergency?

424
00:40:41,716 --> 00:40:43,048
Hello?

425
00:40:43,966 --> 00:40:46,508
Can you hear me? Hello?

426
00:40:47,091 --> 00:40:48,383
200 million?

427
00:40:50,673 --> 00:40:52,297
200 million every month?

428
00:40:57,633 --> 00:40:58,967
With this?

429
00:41:03,764 --> 00:41:05,140
Kang Eunsoo?

430
00:41:08,764 --> 00:41:10,140
Kang Eunsoo?

431
00:41:10,915 --> 00:41:11,915
Ah, yes.

432
00:41:12,221 --> 00:41:16,222
You're here through Manager Baek?
To work in the kitchen?

433
00:41:16,792 --> 00:41:17,889
- Yes.
- Damn.

434
00:41:18,221 --> 00:41:22,221
You're unlucky.
We already hired someone.

435
00:41:23,437 --> 00:41:26,807
Are you okay with other work
besides kitchen duty?

436
00:41:28,377 --> 00:41:29,973
Yes, of course.

437
00:41:39,014 --> 00:41:42,805
You'll see nasty things in club toilets.
Try to ignore.

438
00:41:56,472 --> 00:42:01,556
The Phantom drug trafficking gang has
earned over 200 million won a month.

439
00:42:11,607 --> 00:42:14,274
Have you all been
on vacation or something?

440
00:42:14,919 --> 00:42:17,793
- No, sir.
- Were you lazing off?

441
00:42:19,479 --> 00:42:20,376
No, sir.

442
00:42:20,439 --> 00:42:23,026
How could you not find the bag
with so many people?

443
00:42:25,221 --> 00:42:27,431
It's messy as it is
with the suspect dead.

444
00:42:27,472 --> 00:42:30,014
If you don't find those drugs,
I'll get screwed.

445
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:34,221
And that means all of you
will get screwed too.

446
00:43:05,657 --> 00:43:08,322
Hey, you're all gonna get
ass-cramps.

447
00:43:09,056 --> 00:43:13,556
Go door to door,
stake out in clubs, or do whatever.

448
00:43:14,264 --> 00:43:18,056
Don't sit there like idiots.
You hear me?

449
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:22,690
Everyone, outside.

450
00:43:32,221 --> 00:43:34,764
GWANGNAM POLICE STATION

451
00:43:53,221 --> 00:43:55,973
ART TEACHER

452
00:43:58,411 --> 00:43:59,764
Sua's mom speaking.

453
00:44:00,096 --> 00:44:02,221
Sua hasn't been coming to class?

454
00:44:03,639 --> 00:44:08,221
For a whole week?
That can't be...

455
00:44:08,806 --> 00:44:12,864
My daughter loves art class,
more than anything else.

456
00:44:13,014 --> 00:44:14,806
Yes, I'm aware of that.

457
00:44:15,641 --> 00:44:21,140
I can tell apart between those
who love art and those who're forced.

458
00:44:21,181 --> 00:44:23,368
But why...

459
00:44:29,181 --> 00:44:32,710
Is there something you know?

460
00:44:35,194 --> 00:44:40,472
Well, I could be wrong...

461
00:44:48,184 --> 00:44:49,932
SCHOOL WITHDRAWAL FORM

462
00:45:00,889 --> 00:45:01,931
Are you okay?

463
00:45:03,014 --> 00:45:04,014
Did you get burnt?

464
00:45:04,056 --> 00:45:08,762
Sorry, I have to go.
Thank you for calling me.

465
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:17,181
Quitting school?

466
00:45:17,851 --> 00:45:21,343
You can't just quit school
out of nowhere, okay?

467
00:45:21,413 --> 00:45:25,440
If I go absent for three months,
I can file a withdrawal.

468
00:45:25,518 --> 00:45:28,800
What are you saying?
It's already difficult as it is!

469
00:45:28,815 --> 00:45:32,514
Exactly! Dad collapsed,
and we're about to get kicked out.

470
00:45:32,698 --> 00:45:34,741
How can I keep painting
and go to school?

471
00:45:35,756 --> 00:45:36,850
It's impossible.

472
00:45:38,756 --> 00:45:43,842
Sua, it's not as bad as you think.

473
00:45:44,342 --> 00:45:45,973
Mom will take care of it.

474
00:45:46,588 --> 00:45:50,666
You're only fifteen. If you drop out now,
what will you become later?

475
00:45:50,682 --> 00:45:52,682
Yes, I'm fifteen.

476
00:45:53,947 --> 00:45:56,222
Why do you keep
treating me like I'm five?

477
00:45:56,264 --> 00:45:59,537
The situation's not that bad?
You'll take care of it?

478
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:01,508
Liar...

479
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:06,221
I can see and hear.
Did you think I wouldn't know?

480
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:11,556
You've been borrowing money everywhere
and even sold your wedding ring!

481
00:46:13,351 --> 00:46:15,227
I'm not acting impulsively.

482
00:46:15,556 --> 00:46:17,056
I thought a lot about this.

483
00:46:17,493 --> 00:46:22,556
For now, I'll work part-time
and help pay for Dad's treatment.

484
00:46:23,442 --> 00:46:25,014
I can take the GED for school.

485
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,115
As for painting...

486
00:46:28,668 --> 00:46:30,056
I don't need it anymore.

487
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:32,681
It's not like I'll die without it.

488
00:46:35,973 --> 00:46:37,431
But Dad will die.

489
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:42,264
Dad will die without money.

490
00:47:13,209 --> 00:47:14,209
Is that weed?

491
00:47:16,764 --> 00:47:19,221
Wow, it has no scent.

492
00:47:19,592 --> 00:47:22,280
It's like a cigarette.
Where'd you get it?

493
00:47:22,326 --> 00:47:23,472
James.

494
00:47:23,683 --> 00:47:26,573
Oh, the new dealer you found?

495
00:47:26,681 --> 00:47:29,221
How is he?
Is he good-looking?

496
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:34,622
He's coming later.
Wanna see him?

497
00:47:35,253 --> 00:47:36,253
Yeah.

498
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,054
More than enough.

499
00:47:44,973 --> 00:47:47,597
Let's see how cute this James is.

500
00:48:33,472 --> 00:48:35,472
I saw the news.
What happened?

501
00:48:36,764 --> 00:48:39,306
Something came up.

502
00:48:39,848 --> 00:48:42,014
I can't go into detail.

503
00:48:43,056 --> 00:48:46,264
I need more time
to get your stuff.

504
00:48:46,305 --> 00:48:50,305
You already took my money
for the new drugs. What the fuck?

505
00:48:51,098 --> 00:48:53,514
I can't believe I even listened to you.

506
00:48:53,734 --> 00:48:55,681
Enough. Let me speak to your boss.

507
00:48:55,722 --> 00:49:00,264
Listen, I'll call you back
as soon as I get it.

508
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:05,011
Hey! Hey!

509
00:49:15,806 --> 00:49:16,889
BOSS

510
00:49:20,222 --> 00:49:22,264
Yes, boss.

511
00:49:23,305 --> 00:49:27,098
Damn idiots!
How could they fuck up now?

512
00:49:27,242 --> 00:49:30,056
We're almost out of stock...

513
00:49:30,292 --> 00:49:31,461
James!

514
00:49:32,848 --> 00:49:34,221
There you are.

515
00:49:35,475 --> 00:49:36,764
Got anything on you?

516
00:49:44,389 --> 00:49:46,181
I know you don't take checks.

517
00:49:46,221 --> 00:49:47,691
It's an advanced payment
for this weekend.

518
00:49:47,855 --> 00:49:49,855
You know who's coming, right?

519
00:49:49,886 --> 00:49:52,064
This amount won't cut it.

520
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:53,643
They're used to bigger stuff.

521
00:49:53,697 --> 00:49:55,549
Don't worry.
I'm always ready.

522
00:49:55,596 --> 00:49:58,013
Great, come on.
I'll introduce you to Sujin.

523
00:49:58,099 --> 00:50:00,045
- The daughter of W Entertainment.
- Sure.

524
00:50:13,973 --> 00:50:15,221
James?

525
00:50:15,639 --> 00:50:17,721
He only deals with VIPs.
Why?

526
00:50:18,221 --> 00:50:23,524
- Oh, he left something behind.
- Okay, wait.

527
00:50:25,667 --> 00:50:27,291
Look, he's over there.

528
00:50:28,221 --> 00:50:29,985
Over there, with glasses.

529
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:33,222
Next to the rabbit.

530
00:50:33,264 --> 00:50:36,221
- That's James, right?
- Him?

531
00:50:38,221 --> 00:50:39,889
Yeah, I think that's James.

532
00:51:12,973 --> 00:51:15,023
We gave him
painkillers, so he'll be fine.

533
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:16,167
Okay.

534
00:51:21,098 --> 00:51:24,681
- How are you feeling?
- It hurts.

535
00:51:59,884 --> 00:52:01,073
Honey, I'm here...

536
00:52:09,509 --> 00:52:11,222
HAPPINESS HOSPITAL

537
00:53:11,048 --> 00:53:12,048
Honey.

538
00:53:13,889 --> 00:53:15,347
Why are you here?

539
00:53:15,732 --> 00:53:19,931
Hey, I just felt suffocated.

540
00:53:20,736 --> 00:53:22,290
Needed some air.

541
00:53:22,626 --> 00:53:27,642
But you can't be up there.
Everyone got startled.

542
00:53:28,462 --> 00:53:31,797
If you're feeling stuffy,
should we go for a walk?

543
00:53:31,978 --> 00:53:33,811
Let's go eat out.

544
00:53:34,704 --> 00:53:38,016
- Will that be okay, Doctor?
- Yes, of course. Anytime.

545
00:53:38,221 --> 00:53:43,139
We can call Sua too.
And have a family dinner.

546
00:53:43,397 --> 00:53:44,327
You know...

547
00:53:46,549 --> 00:53:47,841
I regret it too.

548
00:53:49,221 --> 00:53:50,221
What?

549
00:53:50,222 --> 00:53:51,861
I regret marrying you.

550
00:53:53,565 --> 00:53:55,143
If it hadn't been me,

551
00:53:57,221 --> 00:53:59,431
you could've lived more comfortably.

552
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:02,140
You could've been happier.

553
00:54:03,443 --> 00:54:07,639
I thought I could
make you and Sua...

554
00:54:08,841 --> 00:54:12,056
live a really happy life.

555
00:54:17,385 --> 00:54:18,385
Honey.

556
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:21,172
I never thought...

557
00:54:22,848 --> 00:54:24,639
I'd end up like this.

558
00:54:26,857 --> 00:54:29,476
I took everything away from you both.

559
00:54:30,998 --> 00:54:32,998
No, that's not true.

560
00:54:34,181 --> 00:54:37,245
Stop, don't talk like that.
It's not true.

561
00:54:37,346 --> 00:54:38,346
Eunsoo.

562
00:54:42,788 --> 00:54:43,948
I'm sorry.

563
00:55:08,174 --> 00:55:10,253
HAPPINESS HOSPITAL FUNERAL HALL

564
00:55:22,014 --> 00:55:23,973
Uh, ma'am...

565
00:55:25,221 --> 00:55:27,462
We understand you're shocked.

566
00:55:27,970 --> 00:55:30,157
There's nothing I can say
to comfort you.

567
00:55:30,259 --> 00:55:33,848
But we need to know
how you'd like to proceed.

568
00:55:36,221 --> 00:55:37,221
No...

569
00:55:38,597 --> 00:55:42,098
My husband is gone...

570
00:55:46,138 --> 00:55:47,845
What should I do?

571
00:55:50,424 --> 00:55:51,634
I need to go home.

572
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:54,205
Excuse me?

573
00:55:55,014 --> 00:55:56,221
Ma'am?

574
00:55:57,766 --> 00:55:58,861
Ma'am!

575
00:56:39,424 --> 00:56:40,633
No!

576
00:57:02,056 --> 00:57:03,056
Lift him up!

577
00:57:17,077 --> 00:57:18,826
We're not losing the house.

578
00:57:20,722 --> 00:57:22,221
And you're not dying.

579
00:57:22,514 --> 00:57:24,181
I'll protect everything.

580
00:57:24,353 --> 00:57:26,563
So just stay by my side.

581
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:28,514
Just stay alive.

582
00:57:29,221 --> 00:57:30,597
If you die...

583
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:32,639
Me and Sua will...

584
00:57:33,931 --> 00:57:35,559
We'll lose everything.

585
00:58:31,796 --> 00:58:32,797
Sua.

586
00:58:38,987 --> 00:58:41,405
Don't skip school.

587
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:43,520
You don't have to give up
painting either.

588
00:58:43,717 --> 00:58:46,671
I have a plan.
I'll only take a few days.

589
00:58:54,016 --> 00:58:55,517
I'm your mother.

590
00:58:56,262 --> 00:58:59,012
Mothers can do anything.

591
00:58:59,635 --> 00:59:00,800
Trust me, okay?

592
00:59:19,943 --> 00:59:21,351
400,000 WON PER 0.5G. HOW MUCH?

593
00:59:21,385 --> 00:59:22,385
100.

594
00:59:47,307 --> 00:59:48,557
James?

595
00:59:58,630 --> 01:00:00,893
What business does a cleaner
have with me?

596
01:00:02,243 --> 01:00:05,908
I can't wait forever.
Your time's up.

597
01:00:06,301 --> 01:00:08,385
Wait, hang on.

598
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:22,377
When is James coming, anyway?

599
01:00:23,619 --> 01:00:26,760
He shows up when he wants,
sells, and leaves.

600
01:00:26,892 --> 01:00:30,681
None of his customers know
about him apart from his name.

601
01:00:30,728 --> 01:00:33,423
Really? What does he have to hide?

602
01:00:34,677 --> 01:00:35,843
300 million?

603
01:00:36,071 --> 01:00:39,176
In Gwangnam, everyone knows everyone.

604
01:00:39,306 --> 01:00:41,876
Then suddenly,
he appeared out of nowhere.

605
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:44,251
Sounds fishy.
Can we trust him?

606
01:00:44,306 --> 01:00:47,760
Everyone was skeptical at first.

607
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,970
He'll get you weed, ketamine, meth...
Whatever you want.

608
01:00:53,994 --> 01:00:54,800
Hold on a sec.

609
01:00:54,801 --> 01:00:58,283
Plus, he plans his transactions perfectly,
and has good manners.

610
01:00:59,433 --> 01:01:01,800
I was wondering
what you were up to.

611
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:05,260
Lady, did you go around eavesdropping?

612
01:01:06,292 --> 01:01:10,468
Gwangnam is different from Hongdae
or Itaewon. If you're rich and stylish,

613
01:01:10,510 --> 01:01:11,800
they don't care about your age.

614
01:01:12,661 --> 01:01:16,176
Many people are into older prostitutes.
Like guys in their fifties.

615
01:01:17,343 --> 01:01:18,271
What?

616
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:22,032
There are easier ways to earn money.
Why be a cleaner, right?

617
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:32,800
What... are you doing?

618
01:01:33,427 --> 01:01:34,800
Aren't you going to show me?

619
01:01:37,878 --> 01:01:40,515
I need to check you out
before I connect you.

620
01:01:41,506 --> 01:01:43,048
Are you crazy?

621
01:01:44,468 --> 01:01:47,301
Lady, stop pretending!

622
01:01:47,514 --> 01:01:50,306
Nothing's free in this world, right?

623
01:01:52,926 --> 01:01:54,593
No, I'm serious!

624
01:01:56,553 --> 01:01:58,135
You fucking whore.

625
01:01:58,176 --> 01:01:59,593
Come here!

626
01:02:00,468 --> 01:02:02,193
Can we do the transaction tomorrow?

627
01:02:02,381 --> 01:02:05,926
No, security has tightened cuz of Phantom.
No shipments until next week.

628
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:10,968
Crazy bitch!

629
01:02:17,719 --> 01:02:21,552
Damn, do you have
a death wish or what?

630
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:24,926
Bitch, how dare you slap me?

631
01:02:26,593 --> 01:02:27,800
Get up.

632
01:02:31,093 --> 01:02:32,593
You piss me off.

633
01:02:32,635 --> 01:02:33,800
Get up.

634
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,760
What a fucked up day.

635
01:02:37,024 --> 01:02:38,926
Bitch, you need more beating.

636
01:02:48,213 --> 01:02:50,338
- Wha..?
- What are you doing?

637
01:02:53,854 --> 01:02:55,062
I was just...

638
01:02:56,071 --> 01:02:57,530
Payback?

639
01:03:02,137 --> 01:03:03,179
No, no.

640
01:03:11,199 --> 01:03:13,283
She hit me first.

641
01:03:13,801 --> 01:03:17,051
How about we let a third party decide?

642
01:03:17,510 --> 01:03:19,800
Like the cops, for example.

643
01:03:20,552 --> 01:03:22,677
Chill, why go that far?

644
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:25,800
Exactly.
Why go that far, right?

645
01:03:26,892 --> 01:03:29,385
I told you not to cause trouble.

646
01:03:33,135 --> 01:03:35,010
You're banned from coming up here.

647
01:03:35,593 --> 01:03:37,010
Hand over the card key
and fuck off.

648
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:39,926
Who do you think you are?

649
01:03:47,964 --> 01:03:49,299
Wanna find out?

650
01:04:16,283 --> 01:04:17,450
What is this?

651
01:04:22,552 --> 01:04:23,593
Yours?

652
01:04:29,719 --> 01:04:31,176
Is it gold or what?

653
01:04:31,677 --> 01:04:34,486
You can report his ass
for assault if you want.

654
01:04:34,501 --> 01:04:37,677
No, I won't do that.

655
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:46,799
If you change your mind...

656
01:04:48,916 --> 01:04:50,042
Uh, wait.

657
01:04:53,174 --> 01:04:56,466
Thank... you.

658
01:05:09,385 --> 01:05:13,760
There are countless dealers,
but there's no one safer than him.

659
01:05:19,005 --> 01:05:22,136
Nor anyone who draws more curiosity.

660
01:05:32,483 --> 01:05:33,940
James!

661
01:05:41,643 --> 01:05:43,101
Are you down or not?

662
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:50,427
I need it tomorrow.
At least 15g up front.

663
01:06:41,144 --> 01:06:42,228
Who are you, huh?

664
01:06:48,647 --> 01:06:50,800
Wait. The cleaning lady?

665
01:06:51,634 --> 01:06:52,924
What the hell?

666
01:06:55,069 --> 01:06:56,319
Why are you following me?

667
01:06:56,486 --> 01:06:58,694
Hey, are you listening?

668
01:07:03,432 --> 01:07:06,500
It's me.
Don't you recognize me?

669
01:07:12,010 --> 01:07:14,066
Sua's mother?

670
01:07:15,051 --> 01:07:17,613
No way.
What are you doing here?

671
01:07:17,629 --> 01:07:18,629
James.

672
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:26,800
You're James, aren't you?

673
01:07:33,902 --> 01:07:35,612
No, let me explain.

674
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:38,799
A guy I know needed
some help at the club.

675
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:39,800
Count me in.

676
01:07:40,543 --> 01:07:42,002
- What?
- Let's work together.

677
01:07:50,934 --> 01:07:53,933
Let's be partners.
You and me.

678
01:08:48,677 --> 01:08:51,593
WALKING ON THIN ICE

679
01:08:52,234 --> 01:08:54,624
The profit will be split
7:3 in favor of James.

680
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:55,921
Are you kidding me?

681
01:08:56,093 --> 01:08:58,398
I look forward to seeing
how valuable you become.

682
01:08:58,569 --> 01:09:00,036
I can sell it in no time.

683
01:09:00,036 --> 01:09:01,304
I'm curious.

684
01:09:01,390 --> 01:09:03,059
Hey, where did you lose
the drug bag again?

685
01:09:04,093 --> 01:09:06,286
It's identical to the one
from Kim Bongnam's motel room.

686
01:09:06,301 --> 01:09:07,260
James!

687
01:09:07,301 --> 01:09:09,710
You think I don't know
they had a drug party here?

688
01:09:09,765 --> 01:09:11,343
You look damn familiar.

689
01:09:11,385 --> 01:09:14,800
Have you forgotten that I caught you?

690
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:17,296
Then should I tell Sua too?

691
01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:18,799
Fucking bastard...

692
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:20,800
Did you expect
a drug dealer to be nice?
