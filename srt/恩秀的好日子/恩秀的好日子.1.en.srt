1
00:00:53,763 --> 00:00:55,096
4-Charlie-92.

2
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:57,850
Show me out of traffic at Anaheim
and Oregon on the last plate.

3
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:27,170
Hey. Look who it is.

4
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:28,546
What's up, Officer Delgado?

5
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:29,923
You back on good paper already?

6
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:32,843
Yeah, been off probation a month
now. You know, I'm stayin' low.

7
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:37,783
Do me a favor. Keep your hands where
I can see them and turn the car off.

8
00:01:37,807 --> 00:01:38,891
I do something wrong?

9
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:42,393
This your ride?

10
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:43,770
<i>Es de mi papa.</i>

11
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,105
He know his tags are expired?

12
00:01:46,065 --> 00:01:47,649
Shit. He didn't say
anything to me about that.

13
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,114
You been partying?
What's up with her?

14
00:01:54,657 --> 00:01:56,533
No, she's just tired.
You know what I'm sayin'?

15
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:59,244
Oh, yeah? You cruisin'
Millikan High for dates now?

16
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:01,120
<i>Chale,</i> why you gotta
mess with me like that?

17
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,914
Seriously, man, how old is she?

18
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:05,458
All right, look, I'm gonna keep
it straight with you. All right?

19
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,877
She ate a bunch of gummies,
knocked her ass sideways.

20
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:10,278
I'm just trying to get her home
safely. You know what I mean?

21
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,011
Wake her up and step
out of the vehicle.

22
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:18,638
- Fuck, are you serious?
- All three of you.

23
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,515
- Let's go. Nice and slow.
- Man, this shit ain't right.

24
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:22,559
You just be pullin' people
over for nothin' now.

25
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,726
Yo, is that thing on?

26
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,270
I want everyone to see how
you're fuckin' with me.

27
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:28,399
Yo. I'm not gonna ask
again. Out of the car. Now!

28
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,277
4-Charlie-92, requesting back...

29
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,115
What the fuck?!

30
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:45,791
Zoom in, zoom in.

31
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:51,713
999. I'm hit. Officer down.

32
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:55,301
<i>All units 999,
4-Charlie-92 at Anaheim and Oregon.</i>

33
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:04,435
<i>Charlie-92, your status?</i>

34
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,061
<i>Charlie-92, your status?</i>

35
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,626
- Hey. 'Morning.
- Good morning.

36
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:34,840
Hi.

37
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:38,677
Excuse me.

38
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:50,689
Fucked up, right?

39
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:53,776
Insane.

40
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,446
Think something's
off, wait for backup.

41
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,365
Field Training 101.

42
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,873
Command Staff's set up a
GoFundMe for her family.

43
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:10,250
Rookies donate, too.

44
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:13,670
Make sure it's at least
200. Leave your names.

45
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:14,671
Yes, sir.

46
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,177
Let's see who hooks the
bigger fish day one.

47
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,199
Sorry.

48
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:34,959
Uh, squad's ready.

49
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,044
Great.

50
00:05:36,045 --> 00:05:39,881
Wiped everything down, checked it
for contraband, filled the tank.

51
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:41,007
Checked the 12-gauge.

52
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:44,218
So you know, I'm big on effort. I have
a low tolerance for people who bitch.

53
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,888
But if you give me effort,
I can teach you the rest.

54
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:47,847
Got you.

55
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,142
Everyone, bring it in.

56
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,102
Listen up.

57
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,606
Gangs just ID'd
Delgado's shooter.

58
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:57,440
Eddie Watson.

59
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,859
He and the piece-of-shit
driver, Juan Cortez,

60
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,779
are still believed to be in the
city but likely trying to flee.

61
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,156
Watson is a member of
the East Barrio clique.

62
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:07,784
Street name, "Maniac."
I'm not making that up.

63
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:10,369
Detectives are still trying
to ID the female passenger.

64
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,080
We think she's a minor
being trafficked,

65
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:13,790
which could've been
motive for the shooting.

66
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,542
If you get eyes...
any one of you...

67
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,003
on either Watson or Cortez,

68
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:21,131
you do not engage alone.

69
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:23,050
Understood?

70
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:24,509
Yes, ma'am.

71
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,513
I know we're all raw,
but let's keep it in check.

72
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:30,431
We have a multi-agency task force
looking for these motherfuckers.

73
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:31,390
That's their job.

74
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,644
Your job is business as usual.

75
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,354
Any questions?

76
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,941
Watch each others'
backs. Let's get to work.

77
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:41,443
Harmon, hold up.

78
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:44,195
Just give me a sec.

79
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:45,405
Yeah, copy.

80
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,949
You want me to give
the rookie to Rolland?

81
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,410
There's no harm taking
a few days riding solo.

82
00:06:55,124 --> 00:06:56,124
I got him.

83
00:06:58,836 --> 00:06:59,878
Okay, then.

84
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:01,797
Be safe.

85
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:09,012
All right. Let's go.

86
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,806
Academy taught you
need four mags, right?

87
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:14,184
- Yeah.
- You also need four in your bailout bag.

88
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:16,562
Let me get a look at you.
Whoa, watch your back.

89
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:20,556
You forget to shine your belt?

90
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,775
Uh, no, ma'am.

91
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,193
Take the details seriously.

92
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,946
Polishing your boots and your belt
shows you're taking the day seriously.

93
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,281
I'll do better, ma'am.

94
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:30,867
Okay. Oh, shoot, I forgot
something. Can you put this in?

95
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:31,868
Yeah.

96
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:51,430
- Officer Harmon.
- Oh. Diaz.

97
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:54,307
Now that we got that out of the way,
you can stop calling me "ma'am."

98
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,560
- Yes, ma'am. Uh...
- Just "Harmon."

99
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,645
I give this to all
my trainees day one.

100
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,349
"Get out of jail free" card.

101
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:02,357
And they've all used it?

102
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,194
So far, every single one.

103
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:09,447
Do you like Cambodian
coffee, Diaz?

104
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:10,949
Yeah. I grew up on it.

105
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:12,784
Charlie-85, clear.

106
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,078
Look at that. We already
have something in common.

107
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:32,971
Rocket fuel.

108
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:35,724
- <i>Gracias.
- De nada.</i>

109
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:40,354
So, how'd you do at the Academy?

110
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:42,564
Second in my class.

111
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:44,565
Out of how many?

112
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,236
Three.

113
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:53,199
Well, I'm sure that really
reaffirmed your career choice.

114
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,243
Mm.

115
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:56,954
It motivated me.

116
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:58,454
Where you from?

117
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:01,040
Just over the bridge. San Pedro.

118
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,210
Are you the only
badge in your family?

119
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:05,086
Yeah.

120
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:06,754
How'd that go over?

121
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:09,006
- Not too good.
- Mm.

122
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:12,427
My mom, she, uh...
she hates cops.

123
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,099
Everything cool?

124
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,101
Mm-hmm.

125
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,353
East Barrio hotspot.

126
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:26,649
Uh...

127
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:31,113
Hey, you want me to go
inside and check it out?

128
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,573
Where are we?

129
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,536
Uh, where are we now?

130
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:40,871
One of them just shot
me. Where are we?

131
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,957
- Uh, the Cambodian coffee truck.
- That's mobile.

132
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,001
Yeah, it's the one on, um...

133
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:46,961
I'm bleeding out,
for Christ's sake.

134
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:48,672
Yeah, I just... It's fine, um...

135
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,675
No. Get back in
here. Shut the door.

136
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,260
What's the First Commandment?

137
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:57,138
Uh, First Commandment. Uh, know
your use-of-force policies.

138
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:58,639
That's the Academy answer.

139
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,892
Out here, you need to know
where you are at all times.

140
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:03,312
It's life and death.

141
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:04,979
- Got it.
- Okay?

142
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,938
Yeah. Got it.

143
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,232
Staffing shortages means
no more two-officer units.

144
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:09,817
You'll be out here on your own.

145
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:12,570
So study the beat maps of the area and
know them like the back of your hand.

146
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:13,697
Understood?

147
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,072
Understood.

148
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,666
Oh, uh, we got a 273-5
at Ocean and 13th.

149
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,292
Code 3 response is needed.

150
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:27,293
Okay.

151
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:29,803
Let's stimulate our minds.

152
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,309
Hey. Don't forget.

153
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:50,691
Keep him away from me!

154
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:53,277
Calm down, calm down.

155
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:55,988
- Hey, asshole, I will tase you.
- Okay. Dude. Hey! Hey!

156
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,156
Somebody tell me
what's going on.

157
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,575
- He took my purse.
- She's crazy. I didn't take shit.

158
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,994
Neighbors saw him beating on her
after she refused to give him money.

159
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,704
That's bullshit! She
doesn't have any money!

160
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,247
Okay. Just cuff him and
get him out of here.

161
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:08,376
All right. Ma'am?
Sit down. Sit down.

162
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:10,628
Charlie-85. I need
EMS on location.

163
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:12,213
I have a female with a head wound.

164
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:13,672
- Ma'am, is that your son?
- Yeah.

165
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,926
Can you go get me some ice or
something from the freezer?

166
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:18,928
Ma'am, tell me...
hey, it's okay.

167
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:20,513
It's okay. Has he done
this to you before?

168
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,181
You mean robbed me or beat me?

169
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,517
- Why would he rob you?
- He wants money for dope.

170
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:26,478
Okay. Thank you.

171
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:29,647
It's all they had.

172
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,817
Put this over your eye until
the paramedics get here.

173
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:34,026
Or until you get hungry.

174
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,737
Okay. Ma'am, it's okay.

175
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,990
The good news is your son is gonna
cool off in lockup tonight, all right?

176
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:42,326
No, no, no, no. We just
had a little argument.

177
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,286
- Ma'am, he assaulted you.
- Yeah. He's my boy.

178
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:46,122
He's a good kid. He just,
you know, he got into...

179
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:47,957
when he gets in one of
his moods, you know?

180
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,708
Believe me, I get it.
But you can't enable him.

181
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,086
Handing him over to you is
the answer? I don't think so.

182
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:53,045
It's not a suggestion.

183
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:56,090
Hey, don't come in here judging me
like you're better than me, okay?

184
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:57,611
We're more than good,
so you can leave.

185
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,263
Be a hero and get a statement.

186
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:06,475
Hey.

187
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:07,935
What's your name?

188
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,353
Ricky.

189
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:12,232
Answer me this, Ricky.

190
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:14,818
What kind of man
hits his own mother?

191
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,195
You don't know shit.

192
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:20,907
Okay, tough guy.

193
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:24,618
The cop that was shot near
here a few days ago...

194
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:25,953
do you know anything about that?

195
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:27,372
Not any more than you.

196
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:28,831
What about this guy?

197
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,086
You seen him around?
Goes by "Maniac."

198
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:37,007
How about you arrest me on
whatever bullshit charge you got?

199
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,426
Not like I won't be
out in an hour anyways.

200
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,969
Next time we show up here,

201
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,889
you're gonna be leaving in the back
of an ambulance instead of a cruiser.

202
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:48,851
And I am gonna personally make sure that
it is for an attempted murder charge.

203
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:51,104
That's five-to-seven.
You hear me, asshole?

204
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,028
You get a statement?

205
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:01,113
She locked herself in the
bathroom and won't come out.

206
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,823
Told you that bitch is crazy.

207
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:04,783
- She what?
- Yeah. I tried talking to her,

208
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:05,826
but she just yelled at me and...

209
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,411
Didn't they teach you
anything at the Academy?

210
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,163
- The camera goes off after enforcement.
- I know. I know.

211
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:10,623
- I'm sorry. I forgot.
- You forgot.

212
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:11,708
- Where?
- Left.

213
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:15,369
- I didn't see anything inappropriate.
- Yeah. You're not the only one watching.

214
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,799
Ma'am, open up. We are still
conducting an investigation.

215
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:22,384
Ma'am.

216
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:24,512
Take the door.

217
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:27,598
Ow, fuck.

218
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,604
- Oh, fuck.
- Dispatch, where's that EMS?

219
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,355
<i>EMS is en route.</i>

220
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:36,899
Jesus.

221
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,861
I told you. We're good here.

222
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:44,908
We're Code-4.

223
00:14:10,976 --> 00:14:12,936
So, um, you surf?

224
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,191
Do me a favor. Run that Ford.

225
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:20,568
Yeah.

226
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,363
Clean.

227
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:30,203
I saw the board in
your Jeep, so I...

228
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:32,998
Yeah. Okay.

229
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,541
That one.

230
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,003
Running plates takes
luck and skill.

231
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:40,713
You need skill to know
what you're looking for,

232
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,881
but luck determines
what you're gonna get.

233
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,384
I'm sorry. What
are we looking for?

234
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,970
East Barrio affiliations.

235
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:49,722
Um, okay.

236
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:52,433
Uh, well, no East Barrio or
any other clique affiliations.

237
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:53,559
- Mm-hmm.
- But...

238
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,560
the owner does have an active warrant
out for driving on an expired license.

239
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,064
- Light 'em up.
- Let's do it.

240
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,663
Sir, can I see your hands?

241
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,503
License and
registration, please.

242
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,172
Where you coming from?

243
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:25,300
Uh, Del Taco.

244
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,760
Do you have anything in
the vehicle I should know about?

245
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:29,178
Uh, no, Officer.

246
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:32,219
Really? 'Cause if you're straight
with me, this will go a lot easier.

247
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:37,019
I have, um... I
have a pipe in here.

248
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,063
What kind of pipe?

249
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:39,813
Meth.

250
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,273
Is there meth in the car?

251
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,275
No. There's
nothing. No drugs.

252
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,360
- Okay.
- I swear.

253
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:46,236
Okay. Keep your hands
up. That's good.

254
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,797
Take a step out of
the vehicle, please.

255
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,619
Come on out.
Turn around, please.

256
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:56,580
- Why'd you stop me?
- Driving on an expired license.

257
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,917
My license isn't
expired. Check it.

258
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,170
He's right.

259
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:04,498
Is this your vehicle?

260
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,674
It's my brother's.
I'm borrowing it.

261
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:09,052
Well, your brother's
license is expired.

262
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,179
- Watch him, Diaz.
- Yeah, I got him.

263
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:15,516
Hey.

264
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:17,594
Have you tried getting clean?

265
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,020
A bunch of times.

266
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:22,064
Well, you got
anyone that can help you?

267
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,275
Mom? Dad? Cousin?

268
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:29,114
My dad... he's been, um, trying
to get me into a program.

269
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:31,866
Yeah, he's clean. Put
him in back for now.

270
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:37,287
Turn around. Hands
behind your back. Thank you.

271
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,957
All righty, come on.

272
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,440
All right, careful.
Watch your head.

273
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:45,879
Get your gloves.

274
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,716
Split the car up into sections
so we can be more methodical.

275
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:50,592
And remember, head on a swivel.

276
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:51,593
Yeah.

277
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:00,812
Anything?

278
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,396
He loves takeout.

279
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:03,439
Who doesn't?

280
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,399
- Ooh.
- What?

281
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,400
Found something.

282
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:11,197
He was straight with us.

283
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:12,906
Cut him loose.

284
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,537
Look, could I talk to him first?

285
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,205
What are you? Dr. Phil?

286
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,791
Two minutes.

287
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:28,201
Step out of the vehicle, please.

288
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,553
See your pipe on the hood?

289
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,140
You know we can take you
to jail for that, right?

290
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:37,473
You want to go to jail?

291
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:38,641
- No.
- Okay.

292
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:40,267
All right.

293
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:43,729
Call your dad.

294
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:45,106
Right now.

295
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:48,942
I can't do that.

296
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,491
Listen, man. Look at me.

297
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,911
It's your only option here.

298
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,596
Hey, Dad, it's me.

299
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,849
I'm with the police, um...

300
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:22,393
Yeah.

301
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:26,231
No. I know.

302
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:29,651
Go ahead. Tell him.

303
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,153
Tell him you want help.

304
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:38,201
I want... I want help.

305
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,540
Okay. Okay.

306
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:46,542
Okay, bye.

307
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,006
He, uh...

308
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:54,967
He wants me to come back home.

309
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:56,261
There you go.

310
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,263
See? Light at the
end of the tunnel.

311
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:00,764
Okay.

312
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:02,307
I think we're good here.

313
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,937
Get your stuff, please. You can
take the pipe or destroy it.

314
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:07,438
Your choice.

315
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:25,331
Most trainees would've
handled that differently.

316
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,375
I think he might get clean.

317
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:31,254
Yeah. Keep that optimism
as long as you can.

318
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:47,644
<i>And I am gonna personally make sure that
it is for an attempted murder charge.</i>

319
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,354
<i>That's five-to-seven.
You hear me, asshole?</i>

320
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:52,024
You know what? You can hardly
hear what you say to the guy.

321
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:57,030
Shh. I brought
you here for a reason.

322
00:19:57,989 --> 00:20:00,033
This place is like my monastery.

323
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:02,911
Let it all go.

324
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:05,663
I'm just saying, you got
nothing to worry about.

325
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,583
You've been
on a whole six hours.

326
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:12,002
Already you know what I should
and shouldn't be worried about?

327
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:13,712
Here. Take a look.

328
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,464
I don't need to. Report it.

329
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:18,718
I made a threat. That is misconduct,
and I'm better than that.

330
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,640
You want me to rat you out?

331
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:26,559
I can't ask you to lie for me.

332
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:30,938
All right, look, you don't gotta
be so by-the-book for my benefit.

333
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:33,899
Oh, fuck the book. It's got
nothing to do with that.

334
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,028
I've got some people gunning for me.
I don't want that coming off on you.

335
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:40,782
Well, I'm no snitch.

336
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:44,868
<i>All
units be advised</i>...

337
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:47,162
<i>APLR identified a green Mustang</i>,

338
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,790

340

00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:57,006
<i>Consider 187 suspect
armed and dangerous.</i>

342
00:20:57,632 --> 00:20:59,352
I think I know
where they're headed.

343
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:09,393
Why are we here?

344
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:12,187
Dispatch had the
vehicle heading south.

345
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:14,147
East Barrio's been
moving into this area,

346
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:16,526
using some of the foreclosed
homes as drop spots.

347
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,032
You want me to
radio another unit?

348
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:25,261
You know, get some
more eyes out here?

349
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:28,037
No. I wanna play this out first.

350
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:44,429
Shit. That's it. That's it.

351
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:46,805
Fuck. Fuck.

352
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:55,272
Charlie-85, I have eyes on a
vehicle matching that description

353
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:58,359
moving eastbound down the
2200 block of Myrtle Avenue.

354
00:21:58,735 --> 00:21:59,943
<i>Copy, Charlie-85.</i>

355
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:02,155
<i>Be advised, do not engage
until backup has arrived.</i>

356
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:05,574
- Do you see a plate?
- No. Fuck. Can't see around the van.

357
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:07,135
Let me know
when you can see it.

358
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:09,578
I have eyes on
the license plate.

359
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:11,830
It is Tom-John-737.

360
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:16,543
Mustang is moving at
a high rate of speed

361
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:18,712
northbound down the alleyway
off of Myrtle Avenue.

362
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:37,482
Come on, come on, come on.

363
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:52,871
Move, move, move.

364
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,165
He's gonna fucking kill someone!

365
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:58,668
Jesus Christ!

366
00:22:58,669 --> 00:22:59,795
Car, car, car!

367
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:01,556
Yeah, yeah,
yeah! I got it! I got it!

368
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,633
Fuck. Fuck!

369
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:12,641
Oh, shit!

370
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:15,102
Diaz, call EMS!

371
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:17,104
Charlie-85, Charlie-85.

372
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:20,817
Get out of the car! Slow!
Show me your fucking hands!

373
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:23,443
Whoa, freeze! Freeze!

374
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:24,653
Hands! Hands!

375
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:27,197
- Don't move! Hey!
- Hey!

376
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:29,741
- Hey!
- Hey! Diaz! Diaz!

377
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,576
Diaz, stand down!

378
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:32,578
Stop!

379
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:34,913
Fuck! Fuck!

380
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,623
Charlie-85, my
partner's in foot pursuit.

381
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:37,917
I still have one in the car.

382
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,473
<i>Diaz, what's your 20?</i>

383
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:01,899
<i>Diaz, do you copy?
What is your 20?</i>

384
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,403
<i>Diaz, respond!</i>

385
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:12,493
Hey! Let me see
your fucking hands!

386
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,470
<i>Diaz,
come in. Where are you?</i>

387
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:28,425
Vacant home. Vacant home on the
corner of Conley and Valley Drive.

388
00:24:28,426 --> 00:24:29,384
Suspect's inside.

389
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:31,865
<i>Copy. En route.
Stand down until I get to you.</i>

390
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:00,790
Hands! Let me see your hands!

391
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:02,001
What'd I do?

392
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,928
Okay. Did you clear the house?

393
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:14,889
- No, he's not here. He must've...
- Stop talking.

394
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:17,642
Charlie-85. Suspect fled on
foot and is still outstanding.

395
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:19,810
Shit.

396
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,647
You aren't acting right.

397
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:26,066
Why the fuck wasn't he
listening to his radio?

398
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:28,361
I am sick of your
cowboy mentality.

399
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,663
Driver didn't make it.

400
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:41,164
K9 and air support
can't find Maniac,

401
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:43,416
and Cortez is still out
there, so we've got shit.

402
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:45,585
And when I clock out, I gotta
explain to the watch commander

403
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:48,421
why I disobeyed orders and I
almost got my trainee killed.

404
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:50,548
- Didn't you hear me say "stand down"?
- Yes, I did.

405
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:51,716
But you said you
were big on effort.

406
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:55,053
Yeah. I'm also big on IQ, all
right? Entering alone is not smart.

407
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,180
What was I supposed to do,
huh? Just let him get away?

408
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:58,516
You are not hearing me.

409
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,687
What did Lasman
tell you earlier?

410
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:04,896
Sergeant Lasman?

411
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,577
Yes. You two were chopping it up
in the motor pool. What did he say?

412
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:11,945
Is he the one gunning for you?

413
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:13,656
Answer my fucking question, huh?

414
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:16,992
What did he say to you? Did he
tell you not to listen to me?

415
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:19,828
Did he fill your head with more
of that warrior-mode bullshit?

416
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:22,038
He said Delgado was
one of your trainees.

417
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,000
And that you'd take
her murder the hardest.

418
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:32,300
I'm sorry. I... I didn't
want to say anything.

419
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:34,885
Okay? I'm trying to
be respectful here.

420
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:42,225
Yes.

421
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:45,313
Yeah, she was one
of my trainees.

422
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:56,032
She was lucky to have you.

423
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:09,670
What's the fastest you've
ever gotten it back?

424
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:11,547
- Keep it.
- No.

425
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:13,841
I'm not gonna need it.

426
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:17,261
You want to put money on that?

427
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:22,975
<i>All units be advised</i>... <i>211
in progress at 2415 Pacific Avenue.</i>

428
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,396
Charlie-85. Two minute ETA.

429
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:31,108
Clear your head. We still
got half a shift to go.

430
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:59,386
<i>This season
on</i> On Call...

431
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,024
- You good?
- I was.

432
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,651
Until you completely
fucked with my vibe.

433
00:28:14,652 --> 00:28:17,071
- Oh, okay.
- All right? Yeah.

434
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:22,618
Police! Open up!

435
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,286
<i>You need skill to
know what you're looking for.</i>

436
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,164
Luck determines what
you're gonna get.

437
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:31,042
<i>Coming up, knocking
people around was the norm.</i>

438
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:33,628
It is imperative for you to
be smarter and more strategic.

439
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,428
<i>Every move we make
is under a microscope.</i>

440
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:44,597
<i>You're holding me to
some impossible standard.</i>

441
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:45,766
No! No!

442
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:49,227
<i>If we're gonna
make any real difference,</i>

443
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,814
we gotta learn how to
stand shoulder-to-shoulder.

444
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:55,442
<i>We only get one shot at this.</i>

445
00:28:55,443 --> 00:28:57,361
- So what's the move?
- Stay by my side.

446
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:01,406
<i>We think we know
what this job is.</i>...

447
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:03,242
until we get that one call.

448
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:06,078
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

449
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:14,044
Breathe. Breathe.

450
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,432
You are either 100%
with me or not.

451
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:29,727
<i>I'm 100% with you.</i>
