1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,099
Welcome, everyone, to our music club.

2
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,859
This year is so special.

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,539
Because we have the legend here with us.

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:18,139
People call her the legendary electric guitarist.

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,540
Let's meet her, guys!

6
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,770
Why is no one attending?

7
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,300
This way.

8
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,501
Who's she?

9
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,459
P'Jennie. The legendary electric guitarist.

10
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:49,399
She's from Hot Wave Contest the same year as P'Toon. P'Toon Bodyslam, you know?

11
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:52,700
Well, look at this.

12
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,939
Not just Toon. I just dined with Ohm from Cocktail yesterday.

13
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,110
How was it?

14
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,980
I paid.

15
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:10,279
Oops. Let's focus on the present.

16
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,111
I am a fan of you two. I like every post of yours.

17
00:01:14,111 --> 00:01:17,809
By the way, did you guys dance to the Spider song?

18
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,019
Yes? That's all right.

19
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:22,389
Let's skip to this part.

20
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,170
The snack game!

21
00:01:29,031 --> 00:01:33,581
P'Jennie, the university bans students from playing such games.

22
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,969
What? Why is it like this? Who banned it?

23
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:40,739
I can't believe it.

24
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,429
I took a day off just to see you guys play this game.

25
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,429
Can you just proceed with it? I will take all responsibility.

26
00:01:48,429 --> 00:01:51,559
We can't. If these juniors report it to the board,

27
00:01:51,559 --> 00:01:53,659
ur club can get shut down.

28
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,059
Let's do this then.

29
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,859
You don't need to do anything.

30
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:02,639
Wat and Tine will be the ones playing the snack game.

31
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,579
Just the two of them.

32
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,079
Give it up for them.

33
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:12,660
Give me Cha Cha Cha!

34
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,369
Snack! Snack!

35
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:23,060
WatTine!

36
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,129
This game will live on forever.

37
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,999
Who will be the feeder?

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,289
Wat?

39
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,479
Tine?

40
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,413
I will.

41
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,489
You standstill. Let me handle it.

42
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:47,439
Please! My heart!

43
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,999
He said he'd handle it.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,733
Drum roll!

45
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,760
Closer!

46
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,950
Closer! Closer!

47
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,690
A professor is here!

48
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,179
Everybody knows it. My fans know it.

49
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,789
I live my life just to see their moments.

50
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,450
I'm so happy.

51
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,700
What did you just do?

52
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,209
A professor was here. I had to destroy the evidence.

53
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:46,689
You're my secretary.

54
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,340
A little kiss from me won't hurt.

55
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,160
P'Jennie, you're heavy.

56
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:27,740
♫ We see each other every day, and every day is different ♫

57
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:33,610
♫ It seemed like there was no way, how could we fall in love? ♫

58
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,720
♫ But because of our closeness, there are no more excuses ♫

59
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:43,170
♫ I wasn't prepared for these wrong sparks in my heart ♫

60
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:49,610
♫ I used to be a person who never understood ♫

61
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:57,760
♫ I'm so addicted to you that I accidentally and
unconsciously fell in love with you ♫

62
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:06,450
♫ I've been caught in your trap, how can I resist your heart? ♫

63
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:10,430
♫ Excuse me for causing confusion ♫

64
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:14,180
♫ I'm sorry that my heart wants to have you by my side ♫

65
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:22,440
♫ Just being able to love you,
I can't force myself to forget about you ♫

66
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:36,400
♫ I've fallen in love with you,
I can't force myself to forget about you ♫

67
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,689
What should I get Tine for his birthday?

68
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:45,580
I want something simple… but special.

69
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,929
How about… turning a university hall into a surprise party?

70
00:05:48,929 --> 00:05:51,630
Don't you get what 'simple' is?

71
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,949
I just don't know what he likes. I can't figure it out.

72
00:05:55,949 --> 00:05:57,039
He likes you.

73
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,909
I know that. He likes me. He likes me very much.

74
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:04,640
How about you tie yourself with a ribbon?

75
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:09,559
I am being serious here. What color of the ribbon?

76
00:06:09,559 --> 00:06:10,859
Pink.

77
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,410
I can't stand you guys anymore.

78
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,930
How old are you really?

79
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,250
Crappy ideas.

80
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,349
Speak out your idea, then.

81
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,899
Sing him Scrubb songs.

82
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,469
Scrubb again?

83
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,589
Will you ever let my friend move on from this band?

84
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:35,199
But Tine really loves Scrubb. Go on.

85
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,909
Throw him a Scrubb Music Festival.

86
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:41,839
Play him one song every night until his birthday.

87
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,219
This way he will know you're paying attention to him.

88
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,180
Boy!

89
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,410
The Philosopher.

90
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,469
Good morning.

91
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:01,620
I've looked into your latest marketing analysis.

92
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,330
Well... It's so good.

93
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,039
- The team loves it.
- Thank you.

94
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,159
One more thing.

95
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,849
Our company is looking for a new marketing team leader.

96
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:20,400
Would a hard-working young man like yourself be interested, Type?

97
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,789
I'm interested.

98
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:24,990
But you'll be sitting in the Phuket office.

99
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,850
- Phuket?
- Yes.

100
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,089
I know it's far,

101
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:37,850
but this is a good opportunity for you.

102
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:41,439
All right. Just think about it.

103
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,020
When you have your answer, just let me know. Okay?

104
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:48,253
Sure.

105
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,950
You're going to love it.

106
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,999
What's the matter? You seem cranky.

107
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,129
I just got back from the hospital.

108
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,139
The cheerleading team just had a car accident.

109
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,120
What?

110
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,120
[Emergency Room]

111
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,329
P'Fang.

112
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:47,649
I heard your car overturned. I thought you were badly injured.

113
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:50,330
It's great you're all right.

114
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,749
I have a ruptured tendon.

115
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,299
I am not all right, Tine.

116
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,540
Ruptured tendon?

117
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,789
How about the others?

118
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,623
Over there.

119
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,043
I am okay.

120
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,850
As you can see.

121
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,839
I've told you many times to drive slowly.

122
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,890
You never listened.

123
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:22,599
What about our cheerleading club?

124
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,929
What do we do?

125
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:28,109
That's why I called you.

126
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,739
We're about to hit the audition day.

127
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:35,119
And the person I trust the most is you, Tine.

128
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,133
Tine.

129
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,770
Be the club president for me, please.

130
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:56,439
I told her I wanted to be your secretary,

131
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,359
but she wanted me to think again.

132
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,580
You don't have to. Be a cheerleading club president.

133
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,259
Hey! Why so easy?

134
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:08,110
Then don't. Be my secretary.

135
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,499
What? You're confusing me.

136
00:10:10,499 --> 00:10:14,369
You're confusing me. I found an easy way out for you.

137
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,629
So what do you say?

138
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:20,729
I've been practicing guitar.

139
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,120
I want to be your secretary.

140
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,263
I know.

141
00:10:25,263 --> 00:10:27,700
I don't want you to go either.

142
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,740
But what can I do?

143
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:35,650
My boyfriend is smart. Responsible. Hard-working.

144
00:10:35,659 --> 00:10:38,060
And good-looking.

145
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,440
Everyone wants to have you.

146
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,950
What a spoiler!

147
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,989
I only have one boyfriend.

148
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,490
If I don't spoil you, who'd I spoil?

149
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:55,369
Sweet talk. You must be rewarded.

150
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,529
Which song do you want to hear?

151
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,840
I'll play it for you.

152
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,370
You just spoiled my mood.

153
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,779
How was your day, darling?

154
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,489
Stop with the sweet words. Are you online shopping again?

155
00:11:24,489 --> 00:11:28,959
Who is? Do not accuse me.

156
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,260
You're wrong.

157
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,369
You always forget to log out of your email.

158
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,960
I see everything.

159
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,459
I am sorry. I'll stop buying now. Please don't be mad.

160
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:44,589
Okay?

161
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,349
I am not mad.

162
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,829
It's no big deal.

163
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,930
I'm taking a shower.

164
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,909
Our company is looking for a new marketing team leader.

165
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:11,110
But you'll be sitting in the Phuket office.

166
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,100
What?

167
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:23,609

00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,310
You like to force people... and like other things.

337
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:22,450
(You!)

338
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,570
What thing?

339
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,220
Stay out of it!

340
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,489
I'm playing here.

341
00:23:31,489 --> 00:23:33,509
If you aren't happy, then get out.

342
00:23:33,509 --> 00:23:34,550
You too.

343
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:38,479
Fine!! I'm so going. No need to fire me.

344
00:23:38,479 --> 00:23:41,379
Tine! Can I join your cheerleading club?

345
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:44,440
I'm so tired of this asshole.

346
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,279
Hey!

347
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,709
Hey! Just calm down.

348
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:51,320
I just came to ask you guys to keep it low.

349
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,090
Calm down.

350
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:54,670
Don't.

351
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:57,900
Wat, you are the club president.

352
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,099
You carry everyone's dignity. Tell him.

353
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:03,920
Should we lower the noise for them?

354
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,833
No.

355
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,030
I really am sorry.

356
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,260
Please don't be mad.

357
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,193
No.

358
00:24:32,193 --> 00:24:33,850
I'm tired.

359
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:36,759
I killed my throat just to compete with your club.

360
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,540
And here I am being sorry.

361
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,500
Let me put on the lotion for you.

362
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:50,490
Please forgive me.

363
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,690
Wow! It smells great.

364
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,773
Here.

365
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:03,609
Don't be mad. I was standing in front of my club members.

366
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:06,259
I was just going with the flow.

367
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:09,110
I need to take care of my club members, too.

368
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:15,430
Damn! I thought working separately would be good.

369
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,760
It's even worse now.

370
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:21,729
Please forgive me. I will talk to P'Dim tomorrow. Okay?

371
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:24,319
Don't be mad. Let me give you a massage.

372
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:27,009
No. I'll go to bed.

373
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,273
Tine.

374
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,340
Aren't you forgiving me?

375
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,890
Fine. Wait here.

376
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:58,890
This song is for my beloved nuisance…

377
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,160
Again?

378
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:15,600
P'Type, can I borrow your laptop and put on some music?

379
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,133
Sure.

380
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:24,809
Someone forgot to log out of his email.

381
00:26:24,809 --> 00:26:27,470
You're finished!

382
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:32,459
"Details on Marketing Team Leader, Phuket Office."

383
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,709
"Mr. Teerasup.

384
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:41,340
Please be informed about the job promotion in Phuket Office?"

385
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:46,619
P'Type, when will you tell me what's going on?

386
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,780
Do you think I can't see it?

387
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,139
You're overthinking. I am all right.

388
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,090
Just a bit tired.

389
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,629
My name is on the list.

390
00:27:05,629 --> 00:27:07,219
Good job, bro!

391
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:11,379
Are you sure P'Mil will pay attention to me if I'm a cheerleader?

392
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:14,349
Believe me. Stop playing soccer.

393
00:27:14,349 --> 00:27:16,620
He won't care. He only sees you as a brother.

394
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,809
But if you're a chic and lovely university cheerleader,

395
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:22,279
trust me you will have his full attention.

396
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:25,790
- You sure?
- I am! Be confident.

397
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,020
Damn! Nobody is single.

398
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,113
Phukong.

399
00:27:31,113 --> 00:27:34,070
We miss you on the soccer field.

400
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,509
I have practice.

401
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:39,643
Practice?

402
00:27:39,643 --> 00:27:40,439
Practice what?

403
00:27:40,439 --> 00:27:44,079
I am a university cheerleader now.

404
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,090
For real?

405
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,010
Good for you.

406
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:53,643
Anyway, make time to play soccer with me, too.

407
00:27:53,643 --> 00:27:55,420
Don't forget.

408
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,153
See you.

409
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,679
He doesn't seem to be interested.

410
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,150
You're stupid.

411
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:06,600
He kept it inside. Can't you see?

412
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,679
Let me tell you.

413
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:12,540
My next plan is going to work for sure.

414
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,739
Hey!

415
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,140
How many songs has he played for you?

416
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,510
More than ten.

417
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:32,830
His bass was so loud. We couldn't even practice.

418
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,599
Hold on. I'm not talking about the clubs.

419
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:38,630
I'm talking about things at home.

420
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:42,820
- What things?
- About your bir…

421
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,080
Hey! Ohm!

422
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,960
He meant to ask

423
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,919
if you two have sweet moments at home.

424
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,853
Right.

425
00:28:52,853 --> 00:28:56,269
If you had any idea how seriously our two clubs are fighting,

426
00:28:56,269 --> 00:28:57,929
you wouldn't ask that question.

427
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:01,830
Who on earth put the music club next to the cheerleading club?

428
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,070
It's chaotic.

429
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,570
Green just exploded the other day.

430
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:09,010
Guys, be ready for 'Who Are We?'

431
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:10,669
3. 4.

432
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:12,369
♪ Who are we? Who are we? ♪

433
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:14,949
Fine! If you like it this way.

434
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:15,859
I thought things were over.

435
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:19,960
But P'Dim struck back.

436
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,310
Let's go!

437
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,100
Enough!

438
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,309
I will not live with this.

439
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:38,930
Guys! Let's go.

440
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,220
P'Dim!

441
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:45,170
This is how you want it?

442
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:48,139
Yes. Why?

443
00:29:48,139 --> 00:29:51,090
This is my club, my speakers.

444
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,280
I'll play as I please.

445
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,620
Sure you can play.

446
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:59,200
Just pay back the money you borrowed from my dad to buy these speakers.

447
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:06,259
P'Dim! You said you spent the club budget.

448
00:30:06,259 --> 00:30:08,160
Do you think we had a lot?

449
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,760
We had enough just to buy a Bluetooth speaker.

450
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:18,160
I guess we can't stay in peace.

451
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:22,149
Guys, let's take back these speakers.

452
00:30:22,149 --> 00:30:26,050
Take them back!

453
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:28,839
Tine, talk to your friends, please.

454
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:33,109
- Phukong, what are you doing?
- My club comes first.

455
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:37,494
Tine, can you please talk to them?

456
00:30:37,494 --> 00:30:38,950
But Green gave the order.

457
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,440
But you're the club president.

458
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,870
How are we going to practice now, Tine?

459
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,070
Game on!

460
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,840
My dear Green.

461
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,309
I miss you, baby.

462
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,510
I want to kiss you on the cheek!

463
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,399
I haven't started my Scrubb Music Festival yet.

464
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,109
And his birthday is tomorrow.

465
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,429
I got one night left.

466
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:04,710
A love guru once said…

467
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:09,770
never let work conflict ruin your love life.

468
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:13,109
You should do something sweet towards each other.

469
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:17,370
Your work might get smoother and sweeter, too.

470
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,960
Sure. Hold on one second.

471
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,179
Any of you who has finished with the makeup, come over here for the profile photoshoot.

472
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,473
Hurry.

473
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:34,950
We still have time.

474
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,449
Excuse me. Can you put on the wrong foundation color and make it really thick for him?

475
00:31:42,449 --> 00:31:45,840
Hey! Are you crazy?

476
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,119
Trust me. When Tine had makeup on, Wat cleaned it for him.

477
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:54,309
If you wear thick makeup, trust me P'Mil will clean it for you.

478
00:31:54,309 --> 00:31:56,839
- Really?
- Really.

479
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:01,899
Let me know if it's too tight. Can I see the outfit?

480
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,093
Pear is here.

481
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,500
Easy man. Calm down.

482
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:15,040
P'Green asked her to help with the costumes.

483
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,090
You are damn lucky!

484
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:22,030
If I were you, I'd make a move right now.

485
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:28,130
You're carrying perfume around?

486
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:31,639
Make it thick!

487
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,773
Hold on.

488
00:32:33,773 --> 00:32:36,040
They just dumped me.

489
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,100
Hey! What are you doing?

490
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,620
- See you later.
- See you.

491
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:48,540
We're shooting profile photos.

492
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,510
Do you think my makeup is too heavy?

493
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,750
No.

494
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,710
Not at all?

495
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:10,730
Take a look again.

496
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,650
No. It's fine.

497
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:20,260
I'll see you later.

498
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,710
So?

499
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:34,319
It didn't work.

500
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:36,360
How come?

501
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,989
Maybe your makeup isn't heavy enough?

502
00:33:39,989 --> 00:33:41,810
That's right.

503
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:42,830
Put on some more.

504
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,390
This is too much already.

505
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:47,500
How about you two wear it yourselves?

506
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,609
I'm going to clean my face.

507
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,480
Hey!

508
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,130
Green, don't forget to email me the pictures you took.

509
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:06,770
I'll talk to the teachers again about the 2U event budget.

510
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:10,349
I'm home now. Bye-bye.

511
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:16,780
I am exhausted! I'm hungry, too.

512
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,620
King of complaints.

513
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,160
But I'm really tired.

514
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,990
I had to shout louder than P'Dim's guitar.

515
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,809
Would you like to listen to a song? I will play it for you.

516
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:34,490
Come on. You're home now. Stop talking about work.

517
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:38,059
Let's talk about us.

518
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:39,993
Tine.

519
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:47,899
I'm tired. I'll take a shower and go to bed.

520
00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:49,970
How about one song?

521
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:51,569
Just one?

522
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:56,260
I've listened to your club songs all day.

523
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,740
But I tuned my guitar since noon for you.

524
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,990
Aren't you going to listen?

525
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:09,989
A love guru once said… never let work conflict ruin your love life.

526
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,990
Care to join me in the shower?

527
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,170
Just listen to one Scrubb song.

528
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:20,610
I've practiced for you.

529
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:21,789
You choose then.

530
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:25,940
You will play a Scrubb song or scrub my back?

531
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:31,410
Take your pick.

532
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,680
Tine, hold the door!

533
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,269
You're a perv!

534
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:48,040
You lost to your sexual desire.

535
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,740
Let me see.

536
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:53,450
We finally bought a cake just like I said.

537
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:54,829
How is it for a simple surprise?

538
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:57,400
We need to have a cake no matter what.

539
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,090
I just want it to be a little more surprising.

540
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:03,990
Yeah, yeah. Surprising.

541
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,180
Call Tine here.

542
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,413
Wat!

543
00:36:08,413 --> 00:36:10,070
Come out and talk to me.

544
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,903
What?

545
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:20,540
Did your club just request for my club to move away?

546
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,470
I didn't.

547
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,780
Who reported the cheerleading club?

548
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,389
I did.

549
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:37,020
Move.

550
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:39,100
What are you doing?

551
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,059
Well, our members can't practice.

552
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:44,070
Because you always do as he says.

553
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:46,250
I have to do this.

554
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:50,430
Fine. Do you think you're the only one who can report it?

555
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:54,304
We're reporting that your club is loud, too.

556
00:36:54,305 --> 00:36:55,660
- Right, guys?
- Right!

557
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:59,179
- Go on!
- Calm down, everyone.

558
00:36:59,179 --> 00:37:00,799
We can talk things out.

559
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,150
It's no big deal. We don't need to report anything.

560
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,100
It's true. Let's not make it a great deal.

561
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:07,900
Please.

562
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:10,860
I'm doing this for you two.

563
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,979
Let's draw lots.

564
00:37:13,979 --> 00:37:16,229
Who gets the shorter lot can get out.

565
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,900
Get me the lots.

566
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,379
Hey! Hold up!

567
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:23,829
P'Dim, I didn't mean it this way. I mean we should negotiate.

568
00:37:23,829 --> 00:37:28,570
Fine! If you dare challenge us, I mean we should negotiate.

569
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:30,690
Tine, you do it.

570
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:33,039
Great! If that's how you want it.

571
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,070
Wat! You draw it.

572
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,560
Everyone, please stay calm.

573
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,293
Green.

574
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,041
Don't go there.

575
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:48,330
Sorry.

576
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:50,840
- Let's talk.
- What's that smell?

577
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:56,369
Fire!!

578
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:58,890
Shit!!

579
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:01,200
Fire!

580
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,540
- Don't go yet. Help us!
- Help us!

581
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:07,020
Get the instruments out!

582
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,169
That's cool!

583
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:11,739
Cool, my ass! Get the stuff out.

584
00:38:11,739 --> 00:38:14,440
Quickly!

585
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:22,440
Go get the costumes in that room!

586
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,600
The costumes!

587
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:45,259
Everyone, the fire is out now.

588
00:38:45,259 --> 00:38:47,660
Luckily, it didn't spread.

589
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:50,490
How did it start?

590
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:52,870
It was me.

591
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:06,100
It was supposed to be a surprise.

592
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:09,510
This is what's left of it.

593
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,443
I am sorry.

594
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:15,550
Damn you, Wat!

595
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,850
I have no energy left to yell at you.

596
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:21,440
They're in trouble because of you.

597
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,440
I am sorry.

598
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:26,750
I am sorry, guys.

599
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:30,950
Thanks to the cheerleading club for helping us remove the instruments.

600
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:33,390
We have to thank your club, too.

601
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:37,290
I don't think we need to draw lots anymore.

602
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:39,350
If we do that, one club needs to move away.

603
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:42,790
Let's find a way to live together in peace.

604
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:45,549
True.

605
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:49,320
We don't practice loudly every day, actually.

606
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,163
How about…

607
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,670
we schedule when we can be noisy?

608
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:59,119
If the president is okay, then I'm okay too.

609
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:00,660
I am.

610
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,990
P'Dim?

611
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:06,650
The president has said it. I stand by what he said.

612
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:10,500
Okay. If we're good now,

613
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,925
let's move back to our rooms.

614
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,615
Thank you all.

615
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,645
Let's help each other.

616
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,965
My dear Green.

617
00:40:23,965 --> 00:40:26,620
If I stop being an ass,

618
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:29,815
will you come back to the music club?

619
00:40:29,815 --> 00:40:31,179
I don't know.

620
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,065
I'm helping them move things back.

621
00:40:33,065 --> 00:40:36,435
No! I'm helping my friends!

622
00:40:36,435 --> 00:40:37,729
Thank you.

623
00:40:37,729 --> 00:40:41,815
What a surprise!

624
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:45,860
I'll buy you a new one.

625
00:40:47,865 --> 00:40:49,398
Come on.

626
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:52,870
P'Dim, is this your ex's guitar?

627
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,530
You said you sold it.

628
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:56,944
Green, keep your voice down. People can hear.

629
00:40:56,944 --> 00:41:00,930
Keep my voice down? They all know we're together.

630
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:04,215
So you still miss your old sweet times?

631
00:41:04,215 --> 00:41:06,530
Fine!! Stay with your guitar.

632
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:08,995
Don't stay with me!

633
00:41:08,995 --> 00:41:10,480
Wat!

634
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,315
My dear brother, please rescue me.

635
00:41:12,315 --> 00:41:14,839
Hey, bro! Green!

636
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:16,920
Bye!!

637
00:41:18,905 --> 00:41:21,039
The cake is ruined.

638
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:23,135
I didn't even get any picture with you.

639
00:41:23,135 --> 00:41:24,434
It's okay.

640
00:41:24,435 --> 00:41:27,320
You can always buy a new one.

641
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,175
I'll do that later.

642
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:35,119
Fong asked me to join him for hotpot.

643
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,553
Want to come?

644
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:38,720
You go on.

645
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,270
I'll go home.

646
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:42,484
Why?

647
00:41:42,484 --> 00:41:45,235
So you can celebrate with your friends.

648
00:41:45,235 --> 00:41:47,950
We can celebrate later at our place.

649
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:49,685
- Really?
- Yeah.

650
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,300
- You sure?
- Yes.

651
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,469
See you.

652
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:54,774
- Get home safe.
- See you.

653
00:41:56,245 --> 00:41:57,778
Tine.

654
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,519
Hey! P'Type.

655
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:01,699
What are you doing here?

656
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,335
You came to see Man?

657
00:42:03,335 --> 00:42:04,609
To see you.

658
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:06,343
- Me?
- Yeah.

659
00:42:06,343 --> 00:42:08,755
Here. Happy Birthday.

660
00:42:08,755 --> 00:42:12,705
Wow! You got me a present.

661
00:42:12,705 --> 00:42:14,515
I might be in Phuket on your next birthday.

662
00:42:14,515 --> 00:42:17,605
So I wanted to give you this myself.

663
00:42:17,605 --> 00:42:19,235
Celebrities like this plant.

664
00:42:19,235 --> 00:42:20,489
- Really?
- Yes.

665
00:42:20,489 --> 00:42:23,245
Planting can help reduce stress.

666
00:42:23,245 --> 00:42:25,108
Thank you.

667
00:42:25,108 --> 00:42:29,639
By the way, have you told Man about Phuket?

668
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:33,309
Not yet. I don't know how to.

669
00:42:33,309 --> 00:42:36,229
Why? What are you afraid of?

670
00:42:36,229 --> 00:42:39,719
Tine, long distance relationships are scary.

671
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:41,689
The distance is one thing.

672
00:42:41,689 --> 00:42:43,495
But a third person is quite another.

673
00:42:43,495 --> 00:42:47,255
Though we don't have those problems, we still fight every day.

674
00:42:47,255 --> 00:42:50,335
What if I told him I'm going to live in Phuket?

675
00:42:50,335 --> 00:42:52,740
Would he break up with me?

676
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,285
I don't know about that.

677
00:42:58,285 --> 00:43:01,215
If I were you,

678
00:43:01,215 --> 00:43:03,405
I'd tell him straight away.

679
00:43:03,405 --> 00:43:05,069
And if he's not okay?

680
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:07,500
At least you tried.

681
00:43:17,685 --> 00:43:20,405
Surprise!

682
00:43:28,415 --> 00:43:30,465
What are you wearing?

683
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:33,053
Am I cute?

684
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,659
Can you tell what I am?

685
00:43:35,659 --> 00:43:37,680
A shark!

686
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,985
A sea animal is a Phuket theme.

687
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,785
Who told you? Tine?

688
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:49,765
Between the two of us,

689
00:43:49,765 --> 00:43:54,430
I'm not the only one who forgets to log out of his account.

690
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:56,345
I am sorry.

691
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:58,930
I didn't tell you.

692
00:44:00,035 --> 00:44:02,200
Are you okay with it?

693
00:44:02,675 --> 00:44:04,490
I am.

694
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:07,545
It's a good job opportunity.

695
00:44:07,545 --> 00:44:09,065
I understand.

696
00:44:09,065 --> 00:44:13,535
I can follow you there after I graduate.

697
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:18,043
Thanks a lot.

698
00:44:18,043 --> 00:44:21,840
Oh! For you, I got you something.

699
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:29,280
I shopped online the other day

700
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,709
and bought two pairs of shoes.

701
00:44:31,709 --> 00:44:35,119
So we can wear them and run together.

702
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,685
We're both on a diet. Right?

703
00:44:37,685 --> 00:44:39,785
Let's try them on.

704
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:46,165
Are they cute?

705
00:44:46,165 --> 00:44:48,108
They are.

706
00:44:49,385 --> 00:44:50,699
They have dolphins on them too.

707
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:53,270
Are you crying?

708
00:44:54,455 --> 00:44:56,605
So cute. Do they fit?

709
00:44:56,605 --> 00:44:58,915
Perfectly.

710
00:44:58,915 --> 00:45:01,905
- You should wear them too.
- Why?

711
00:45:01,905 --> 00:45:04,070
So we can go run together.

712
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:07,780
After I'm gone, you'll be running with someone else.

713
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:10,264
P'Type, just put your trust in me.

714
00:45:10,265 --> 00:45:12,950
You should know how hard it was to get you.

715
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:15,230
I will never leave you.

716
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:17,709
You, on the other hand, will get to meet new people

717
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:19,199
and live in a new place.

718
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,390
I remember one time.

719
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:25,195
You ditched my motorbike for a car.

720
00:45:25,195 --> 00:45:29,929
I haven't forgotten. It's still in my head.

721
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:33,080
It hurt.

722
00:45:35,765 --> 00:45:40,254
If you want me to trust you, you have to trust me too.

723
00:45:40,254 --> 00:45:44,125
Of course, I do.

724
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,753
Thank you.

725
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:12,050
Meet me at the pool.

00:47:26,018 --> 00:47:28,755
That plan also failed every day.

It has a disturbing face, just like you.

740
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:42,350
It's my doll. It has to look like me.

Isn't it the music club's turn today?

766
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:55,120
We need to practice for the 2U event, too.

767
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,630
- You figure out.
- You too, Tine.

768
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:58,840
This is a card of truce.

769
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,629
You said we wouldn't talk about work at home.

If you want love, you have to fight for it.

Hey! Boss.

772
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,364
What do you want me to do?

773
00:50:05,365 --> 00:50:07,239
We've been like this since the beginning.

774
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,470
If you don't like me, just stay away from me.

775
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:12,200
Come on. Don't be upset.

776
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,969
I miss you, Wat.
