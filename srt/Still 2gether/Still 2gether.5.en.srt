335
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,753
Let's do this.

336
00:20:19,753 --> 00:20:22,819
You share the seafood with Green.

337
00:20:22,819 --> 00:20:26,209
He loves to eat. He'll come around.

338
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,139
True.

339
00:20:29,139 --> 00:20:33,400
I know, that deep down you want to make up with Green.

340
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,229
Why are you pretending not to?

341
00:20:35,229 --> 00:20:37,846
You still have him on your screen.

342
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,099
Stupid ego!

343
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:42,870
It's no big deal at all.

344
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:49,320
You have sold out?

345
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,240
All right. Thank you.

346
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,846
They said a guest here bought it all.

347
00:20:54,846 --> 00:20:58,520
Must be P'Dim who bought it before us.

348
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,780
See?

349
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,213
Green.

350
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,340
Well...

351
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,173
We'd like to share this house with you.

352
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,759
We didn't come empty-handed.

353
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:16,779
We have all the seafood from the market.

354
00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:18,390
We can share it all with you.

355
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:23,420
I will give you… one-thirds of the seafood.

356
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,380
About the house sharing, I'm okay with it.

357
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,879
About the seafood,

358
00:21:33,879 --> 00:21:36,399
I want two-thirds.

359
00:21:36,399 --> 00:21:37,910
Nope.

360
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:40,319
I give you one-thirds. Take it or leave it.

361
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:41,729
No way!

362
00:21:41,729 --> 00:21:44,379
Then no seafood for you. Let's go!

363
00:21:44,379 --> 00:21:46,324
Hey! P'Dim.

364
00:21:46,324 --> 00:21:49,979
Look at him. This is who he is.

365
00:21:49,979 --> 00:21:51,639
He's always like this.

366
00:21:51,639 --> 00:21:53,610
He can't stand losing. He just has to win.

367
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:54,940
He always gets what he wants.

368
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,326
About our YouTube channel, too.

369
00:21:58,326 --> 00:21:59,960
YouTube channel?

370
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,646
What YouTube channel?

371
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,105
We were naming our YouTube channel together.

372
00:22:06,106 --> 00:22:08,486
We agreed to name it GreenDim at first.

373
00:22:08,486 --> 00:22:10,219
But P'Dim changed his mind.

374
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:14,306
He wanted his name first. He wanted DimGreen.

375
00:22:14,306 --> 00:22:18,140
I am a leader. My name must come first.

376
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:22,249
We had to compete in that stupid volleyball game

377
00:22:22,249 --> 00:22:24,689
just because you wanted your name before his?

378
00:22:24,689 --> 00:22:27,812
It's a big deal. It's my dignity.

379
00:22:27,812 --> 00:22:29,973
Right, everyone?

380
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:32,639
Guys, bring this inside. Let's eat together.

381
00:22:32,639 --> 00:22:34,620
Help each other.

382
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,346
Come on.

383
00:22:37,346 --> 00:22:39,339
Let's go.

384
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,039
Grill them. Come on, Green.

385
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:44,080
- My money.
- No. It's the club's budget.

386
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,820
Wat, it's my money. I paid for that.

387
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,720
Let's eat.

388
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,250
GreenDim, it is.

389
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,493
What the heck?

390
00:22:57,493 --> 00:22:59,890
I always please you when you pout.

391
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:01,860
Why can't you do the same for me?

392
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,090
Who are you looking for?

393
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:16,733
Your brother.

394
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,559
Seriously. When did you two get together?

395
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,869
When he became a cheerleader,

396
00:23:24,869 --> 00:23:27,410
but I'd liked him long before that.

397
00:23:33,534 --> 00:23:38,359
You're serious with him or you just want to get back at me?

398
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:39,990
Why would I do that?

399
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,449
Waste of time.

400
00:23:41,449 --> 00:23:43,940
I'd rather spend my time playing soccer with your brother.

401
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,319
So you are serious.

402
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,390
If I wasn't,

403
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,340
I wouldn't be standing here talking to you.

404
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,760
Take good care of him.

405
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,870
Or I'll take him back.

406
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:12,100
You're using my words against me now?

407
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,280
Fine.

408
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:19,160
Go find him. That way?

409
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:22,390
Thank you.

410
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:32,740
Phukong, here you are. I looked for you everywhere.

411
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,832
Where have you been?

412
00:24:34,832 --> 00:24:36,600
Well…

413
00:24:37,426 --> 00:24:40,320
I've been with your brother asking for his permission.

414
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:43,606
Are you kidding me?

415
00:24:43,606 --> 00:24:45,270
I have no reason to do that.

416
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:47,649
I don't know. You've always fooled me.

417
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:52,100
You tricked me all the time to play soccer or build models with you.

418
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,833
I wasn't tricking you.

419
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:58,170
I was just finding excuses to get close to you.

420
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:04,520
I told you a million times that this area is for brothers.

421
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,199
I know. Right here.

422
00:25:07,199 --> 00:25:08,819
You just can't remember, can you?

423
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:13,139
But for me, patting the head is 'I like you.'

424
00:25:13,139 --> 00:25:15,070
Can I get your hand?

425
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,913
Hand, please.

426
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,050
Look at me.

427
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:30,780
- What?
- Holding hands is 'you're my boyfriend.'

428
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,770
Aren't you shy now?

429
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:36,239
Why should I be?

430
00:25:36,239 --> 00:25:38,070
My boyfriend is so cute.

431
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,800
You just realized now that I'm cute?

432
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:46,140
Oh! I've got something for you.

433
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,910
- What?
- I drew it the best I could.

434
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,443
Let's see.

435
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,730
Tell me again that you're an Architecture student.

436
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,630
This is the best you've got?

437
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:07,540
Let me have a clear look.

438
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:09,950
It's not so bad.

439
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:12,550
Judging from the eyebrows, I can tell who this guy is.

440
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,740
Give it back.

441
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,090
You gave it to me. It belongs to me now.

442
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,380
And I belong to who?

443
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,710
Me?

444
00:26:24,633 --> 00:26:26,840
The one sitting next to you now.

445
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:34,920
Boss.

446
00:26:35,463 --> 00:26:37,180
Your chance is here.

447
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,713
Confess already.

448
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,900
What should I say?

449
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,299
You can start with your soccer jersey.

450
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:46,889
Tell her you printed it wrong.

451
00:26:46,889 --> 00:26:49,520
It was supposed to be Doctor Pear or something.

452
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,333
Go on.

453
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,321
- Come on.
- No.

454
00:26:55,321 --> 00:26:58,819
Trust me. One last time. Don't back off now.

455
00:26:58,819 --> 00:27:02,080
Go. Do it!

456
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,610
Hi, Boss.

457
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:17,480
Why are you sitting here by yourself? You okay?

458
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,809
I am. I'm a bit worried about school and a bit sick.

459
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:24,090
I don't want to spread the flu.

460
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:30,559
About school, you can talk to me.

461
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,059
I might not seem like one, but I am a nerd.

462
00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:36,300
Are you serious?

463
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:40,569
And about the flu... Are you going to spread the flu to me?

464
00:27:40,569 --> 00:27:43,630
No. I won't do that.

465
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:50,490
By the way, how is it going with you and that Cute Piggy?

466
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:55,330
It wasn't supposed to be 'Cute Piggy' actually.

467
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:57,120
What should it have been then?

468
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,280
Take a guess.

469
00:28:19,386 --> 00:28:22,066
[Cute XXX]

470
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,420
Cute Bear?

471
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,559
No.

472
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,193
Go again.

473
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:39,160
- Cute Puppy?
- Why would I print that?

474
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,206
I don't know.

475
00:28:42,793 --> 00:28:44,120
I'll give you clues.

476
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,260
She is very cute.

477
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:49,290
She is kind.

478
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:53,510
When she sees someone getting hurt, she always helps.

479
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,863
Who is it?

480
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:09,403
Cute Doctor?

481
00:29:09,403 --> 00:29:10,940
Which doctor?

482
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,940
Do you like one of my friends?

483
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:17,220
Right? Which one? I'll introduce you.

484
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,834
He likes you, Pear.

485
00:29:23,834 --> 00:29:26,410
- What?
- He likes you, Pear!

486
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:30,019
- I can't hear you.
- He likes you!

487
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:06,820
Hello, P'Type.

488
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,609
Hello. What are you doing, Man?

489
00:30:09,609 --> 00:30:12,826
I am missing you.

490
00:30:12,826 --> 00:30:14,780
I am at the beach.

491
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,510
So many couples here.

492
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:21,190
But I am all alone with no one.

493
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:24,919
I can't listen to your complaint. I have to go meet someone.

494
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:26,780
What? Meet who?

495
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:30,279
With a man with thick eyebrows,

496
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,780
mustache, and a lustful face.

497
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:37,260
He can't be trusted.

498
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,190
Do not go near him.

499
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:40,820
Understand?

500
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,740
I think so too but it's too late now.

501
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,700
I do trust him.

502
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,820
Hello? What did you say?

503
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,529
P'Type? Can you…?

504
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:54,589
P'Type, how did you come here?

505
00:30:54,589 --> 00:30:56,110
I took a flight, of course.

506
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,780
I can stay one night only and go back tomorrow.

507
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,806
Just one night?

508
00:31:01,686 --> 00:31:05,739
That's okay. One night is enough for me.

509
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,490
Enough for what?

510
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:10,123
It's…

511
00:31:11,873 --> 00:31:15,512
When I was away, did you have eyes on someone else?

512
00:31:15,512 --> 00:31:18,323
Here we go again. You always ask me that.

513
00:31:18,323 --> 00:31:20,340
Who would I lay eyes on?

514
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,100
I have eyes on you and you only.

515
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,340
I told you to trust me.

516
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,110
I'm joking.

517
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,000
I do trust you, Man.

518
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,680
You told me it was difficult to get me.

519
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:36,073
And I didn't open my heart so easily.

520
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,420
Why are you being romantic today?

521
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,353
Are you sick?

522
00:31:41,353 --> 00:31:42,933
You okay?

523
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,139
- What I'm telling you is...
- Is…?

524
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:51,550
A long distance relationship is tough.

525
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:54,140
It requires trust.

526
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,620
It requires patience.

527
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,270
And I want you to be patient.

528
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:00,066
I will be, too.

529
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:09,849
That's it. Let go.

530
00:32:09,849 --> 00:32:14,253
P'Type, I miss you.

531
00:32:19,033 --> 00:32:20,760
Just "um"?

532
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,979
What? How could you respond to me with that?

533
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,385
I've always missed you. We are so far apart.

534
00:32:26,385 --> 00:32:28,086
- We get to meet once in a blue moon.
- Man.

535
00:32:28,086 --> 00:32:29,519
You said…

536
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:41,926
You can't say I don't miss you now.

537
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:52,866
So we have just one day, right?

538
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,320
Should we…

539
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:59,953
do it now?

540
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,849
Do what? No!

541
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:07,500
Do what we always do.

542
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,000
Come on. Don't be shy.

543
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,820
Where are you going? P'Type.

544
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,413
Should we start?

545
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:19,600
Hello, everyone, Green Grub Grub's fans.

546
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,320
Long time no see.

547
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,430
You all know it.

548
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:25,540
Green and I had a fight.

549
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:29,600
Because I forced him to name this channel DimGreen.

550
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,740
I wanted to come first.

551
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:35,060
So I want to say I am sorry.

552
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,690
Louder!

553
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:38,150
I am sorry.

554
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:41,893
From now on, this channel will be called GreenDim.

555
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,600
No.

556
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,030
Our channel will not be GreenDim.

557
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:50,280
From now on, this channel has a new name called

558
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:54,660
"Sunshine and Daisy."

559
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,040
How come?

560
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,040
Hey! It's your band's name.

561
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,720
Sunshine Daisies and Butter Mellow.

562
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:05,933
You will be the sunshine and I'll be a daisy.

563
00:34:05,933 --> 00:34:10,093
So you let my name come first.

564
00:34:10,093 --> 00:34:11,760
Yeah.

565
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,560
Why are you so cute?

566
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,290
Let me give you a kiss.

567
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:18,899
Stop! We're still live.

568
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:20,344
That's okay. Let them witness.

569
00:34:20,344 --> 00:34:22,959
It's embarrassing.

570
00:34:22,959 --> 00:34:25,310
Let's start our first video.

571
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:34,273
Everyone, our first episode will be "Sunshine and Daisy on the Beach."

572
00:34:34,273 --> 00:34:36,089
You want it on the beach?

573
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:37,820
I'll do it till you drop.

574
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:40,120
Let's take the camera, too.

575
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,653
Everybody, please help.

576
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:13,430
♫ I'm the one who once had a dream ♫

577
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:20,610
♫ And I'm the one who one day left it ♫

578
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:28,210
♫ One day the events of the past passed away ♫

579
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:35,100
♫ One day what is stored will remain that way ♫

580
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,920
♫ Looking up to the vast sky and ocean ♫

581
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:47,580
♫ Smelling the earth out of the wind blowing
towards me from very far away ♫

582
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:55,510
♪ On this gigantic planet, we are just small people
looking up to the vast sky and ocean ♪

583
00:35:55,510 --> 00:36:02,540
♫ Smelling the earth out of the wind blowing
towards me from very far away ♫

584
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:14,534
♪ On this gigantic planet, choose your desired path ♪

585
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,980
How was it?

586
00:36:21,633 --> 00:36:23,720
Did you feel the love?

587
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,793
How would I feel love?

588
00:36:25,793 --> 00:36:27,893
It's not a love song.

589
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:32,490
How is it not?

590
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:37,130
Every song I play for you, I play with love.

591
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:41,430
Yuck! Cheesy.

592
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:47,330
Where did you go just now?

593
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,760
To get you this towel.

594
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,446
Your hair is wet. You can get sick.

595
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:05,180
Why don't you take good care of yourself like you take care of me?

596
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,293
I'm your boyfriend.

597
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:15,570
I need to take care of you.

598
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,350
I know.

599
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:22,110
But being boyfriends is about give and take.

600
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:25,670
Let's do this. When you're too lazy to take care of yourself,

601
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:29,720
let me take care of you.

602
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:31,903
Okay?

603
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:41,480
Taking care of me is easy.

604
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,710
Just let me grab your boobs.

605
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:47,083
My boobs?

606
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,300
All right.

607
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,510
Go ahead. Do it.

608
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:54,070
Grab them.

609
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:56,371
- Do it.
- Hey!

610
00:37:56,371 --> 00:38:00,680
And I thought you were brave.

611
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,520
Earn.

612
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,384
We have plenty of squid here. Come get some.

613
00:38:30,384 --> 00:38:31,889
Wait here.

614
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:33,723
Stand here.

615
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,732
Why aren't you talking to our friends here?

616
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:37,940
What's the matter, Boss?

617
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,540
- He's thirsty.
- What's up, Boss?

618
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,372
Talk to them.

619
00:38:41,373 --> 00:38:44,200
We're off now. Don't get too drunk.

620
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,733
You suck.

621
00:38:48,733 --> 00:38:50,620
You got a very good chance this evening.

622
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,940
Why did you run into the water?

623
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,973
What happened?

624
00:38:53,973 --> 00:38:55,050
Wat and Tine…

625
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:56,260
- Don't.
- I'm telling them.

626
00:38:56,260 --> 00:39:00,150
This evening, Boss had a chance to confess to Pear.

627
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:03,000
But he ran into the water.

628
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,400
Were you that shy?

629
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,733
It was hot.

630
00:39:07,733 --> 00:39:10,900
- I went for a swim.
- You sure?

631
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,750
What's wrong with that?

632
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,970
Why do you keep looking at your watch?

633
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:18,120
Anywhere to get to?

634
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,733
Nowhere.

635
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,613
What's up?

636
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:26,705
Nothing.

637
00:39:26,706 --> 00:39:28,480
You can talk to me.

638
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,360
I'll go get more ice.

639
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,133
We ran out of ice cubes here.

640
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:37,853
We still have a lot.

641
00:39:46,271 --> 00:39:50,120
How did you guys come?

642
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:55,400
We're here to witness your little surprise for him.

643
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,560
And I'm going live it for Phuak to see.

644
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,150
So how is it going?

645
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,447
It's going nowhere.

646
00:40:02,447 --> 00:40:03,780
Look!

647
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,609
He's still drinking with his friends.

648
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:08,066
He might be drunk already.

649
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,020
Will it even work?

650
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,826
I've got a plan. Don't you worry.

651
00:40:20,826 --> 00:40:23,880
You can take him for a walk along the beach.

652
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,809
Leave the rest to us.

653
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:27,643
You're so smart.

654
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:32,039
- Are you sure?
- Just trust us.

655
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:33,700
It's so good here.

656
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:37,440
With you, anywhere is good.

657
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,420
Wat, have you ever thought about how you would be

658
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:47,946
if I turned you down that day?

659
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,500
No.

660
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,733
You were that confident?

661
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,300
I wasn't.

662
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,946
But when I love someone,

663
00:41:02,946 --> 00:41:05,230
I don't keep my heart in reserve.

664
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:13,173
The worst-case scenario was I got hurt...

665
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:16,026
and got over you.

666
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:22,173
Then, you're lucky I didn't turn you down.

00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,600
Right.

I was lucky enough to see you cry, too.

669

Don't rub it in!

670
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:40,613
Since that day,

671
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,480
we have been through a lot together.

672
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,913
Yeah.

673
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,906
Wat!

674
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,640
The soccer game is on.

675
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,220
Can I go watch the game?

676
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:59,520
- But today is…
- Man U against Liverpool. It's about to start.

677
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,330
Let me go check it out.

678
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,793
Where is Wat?

679
00:42:13,793 --> 00:42:15,660
Went to see a soccer game.

680
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:20,310
So much for a smart plan.

681
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:21,920
It failed.

682
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,553
I am sorry.

683
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,400
Let's do this.

684
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:32,340
Since he's gone, how about we go get drunk?

685
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:34,743
Yeah?

686
00:42:38,773 --> 00:42:41,670
Now we all learn that

687
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:45,593
not everyone can remember their anniversary.

688
00:42:45,593 --> 00:42:47,606
Keep that in mind.

690
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,200
I read this somewhere.

691
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:57,120
Scrubb asked his fans

692
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,860
if they listened to the same song a hundred times over,

693
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:03,160
would they still be into the song.

694
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:07,786
For me, yes.

695
00:43:07,786 --> 00:43:12,546
For him, I'm not so sure.

696
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,550
You're not sure.

697
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:18,173
You want to know. Right?

698
00:43:18,173 --> 00:43:19,966
Then go ask him.

699
00:43:19,966 --> 00:43:21,299
What?

700
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:24,420
- Ask him?
- Yes.

701
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:28,160
You promised him that

702
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,539
whatever was on your mind, you must speak out.

703
00:43:31,539 --> 00:43:35,580
- Right.
- If you want to know if he's still into the same old song,

704
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:38,080
you have to ask him.

705
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:40,580
- Right.
- Go on.

706

What happened to you?

711
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:38,553
I went out for a walk.

712
00:44:38,553 --> 00:44:40,680
And I just tripped over my feet.

713
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,970
Did you hurt yourself?

714

715
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:49,190
Just be more careful next time.

716
00:44:57,730 --> 00:44:59,830
Do you have anything to say to me?

717
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:05,310
I can always tell when you act suspiciously.

718
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:07,020
Just tell me.

719
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:13,860
You said we would have a heart to heart talk.

720
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,720
Fine.

721
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,393
I didn't trip over.

722
00:45:19,393 --> 00:45:21,400
I fell because I was drunk.

723
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:25,986
I was drunk because you forgot our anniversary.

724
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:33,410
I asked you to take a walk because I wanted to surprise you.

725
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:35,913
I was going to play guitar for you.

726
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,600
Okay.

727
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,650
It's good you got it out.

I have something to tell you, too.

I prepared you a surprise as well.

You're overthinking it.

So… is it too late to ask for that surprise?
