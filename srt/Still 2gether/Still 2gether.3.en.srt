00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,919
After I saw you at the Scrubb concert,

3
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,759
I looked for you at every concert that Scrubb played.

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,206
I saw one guy who looked exactly like you.

5
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,939
- Yeah?
- What's up?

6
00:00:45,939 --> 00:00:48,372
Did you find that smiley guy of yours?

7
00:00:48,373 --> 00:00:52,706
I didn't. I looked for him everywhere.

8
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,606
I guess I failed again.

9
00:00:55,606 --> 00:00:58,180
I started questioning myself about what I was doing.

10
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,120
Why did I bring myself to disappointment over and over?

11
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,620
It was time for me to get over you.

[Present Day]

14
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:15,239
The coming traditional football and music day is called 2U.

15
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,679
Our university will compete against the other participating universities.

16
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,469
It's a chance for us to make friends through a soccer match, music show, and cheerleading activity.

17
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:26,809
Winning or losing is not the point.

18
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,219
We can let our sucky soccer team lose.

19
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,519
But our cheerleading team… must win!

20
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:34,144
Don't take it as a serious competition.

21
00:01:34,145 --> 00:01:37,053
Just compete with yourselves and beat them up!

22
00:01:37,053 --> 00:01:43,230
This is just one of the most IMPORTANT events for our club!

23
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,659
Don't worry about the prize. It's only a few hundred thousand.

24
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,760
Though we can use it to better our club.

25
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,286
I am not pressuring you guys.

00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,999
And we aren't using microphones for you.

45

Yeah? What are the rules for if you come up with an excuse?

- I have something to talk to you about.
- I knew it.

You're so easy to read. You've been glancing at me.

62
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,720
Right. I feel so damn uncomfortable here.

63
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,520
My club is behind schedule.

64
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,520
I'd like to ask for more time to be loud.

65
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,509
Can we change it from 'every other day' to '2 days for me and 1 day for you'?

66
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,492
P'Dim was thinking three for us and one for you.

67
00:05:11,492 --> 00:05:14,719
What? Are you serious? I just told you we're so behind.

68
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:16,140
That's why I didn't tell you.

69
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,860
But you already said it, Wat.

70
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,919
See this? The card of truce.

71
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,559
You said so yourself that we wouldn't talk about work at home.

I…

73
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,253
Fine. We can talk later.

74
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,780
Where is my facial foam?

75
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,469
Oops! I forgot. It's in my bag.

76
00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:53,560
- Go get it.
- Okay.

77
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,346
I know you like it.

78
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:16,153
Someone once said, "If you want to use my stuff, you need to ask first."

79
00:06:16,153 --> 00:06:18,500
So much for rule-keeping.

80
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,099
Oh well! Are you picking at me about the club?

81
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:28,152
That's right. Our couple has passed the sweet period.

82
00:06:28,152 --> 00:06:29,953
I am not.

83
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,100
Good then.

84
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:40,039
Because I see that my body lotion always gets stolen, too.

85
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,640
That thief must have really nice skin.

86
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:49,190
You haven't washed your face yet. Let me help.

00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,939
Clean.

88
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,253
It's clean now? You haven't brushed your teeth either.

89
00:06:55,253 --> 00:06:58,233
Hey! But that's my neck.

90
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,619
Wat.

91
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,590
I'm not talking about work.

92
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,209
I know.

93
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,473
I just can't sleep.

94
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:22,670
How about we play guitar?

95
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:26,053
I want to hear…

96
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,793
"Everything."

97
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:33,212
No. I'll play Desktop Error's songs.

98
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:39,699
Right! Our couple has passed the sweet period.

99
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:41,539
Back then,

100
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:46,006
you played me any song I wanted to hear.

101
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,090
How about you play it yourself?

102
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,649
Fine!! Give it to me!

103
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,186
I was joking. Joking.

104
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,266
Back then,

105
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,999
the most serious argument we had was about what we were going to eat.

106
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,553
Look at us now.

107
00:08:10,553 --> 00:08:15,920
The work, the clubs, and the members.

108
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,550
Everything is just so messed up.

109
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:23,506
Choosing a song to play can be our quarrel now.

110
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,466
Being mature is not easy.

111
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,120
Oh, Wat!

112
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,689
My cheerleading club will practice on the field tomorrow.

113
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:42,673
You guys can be as loud as you want.

114
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,889
- No need.
- I've thought about it.

115
00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:50,866
My team can practice anywhere.

116
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,899
You can't. They are now practicing in a nice room with an air-con.

117
00:08:56,899 --> 00:08:59,420
If you drag them down and practice outdoors,

118
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,759
how will they think of you now?

119
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,459
It's okay. I will talk to them.

120
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:07,850
I'm sure they understand.

121
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:14,749
Don't worry. I'll deal with them.

122
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,149
Phukong, how is it going?

123
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:24,639
The competition is near. I still can't remember all the moves.

124
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:27,919
It's not that. We're asking about you and P'Mil.

125
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:29,453
How is it?

126
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:34,130
I haven't seen him since the day we had the profile photoshoot.

127
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,899
He didn't bring you snacks or makeup remover?

128
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,999
Did he follow your IG? Did he want to grab your boobs?

129
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,059
Not at all.

130
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:46,439
If he were Wat, you'd be testing the bedsheets together by now.

131
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,779
Come on. Don't be sad.

132
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,579
If you want love, you need to fight for it.

133
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,700
Hi. How are you?

134
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,593
Hello. Keep fighting.

135
00:09:57,593 --> 00:10:00,739
- Hey, Boss! What are you doing here?
- Holy sh…!!!

136
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,620
Keep it together, man.

137
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:10,279
- What nice weather.
- But you're sweating.

138
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:12,320
Yeah?

139
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,349
Boss! You just told him to fight.

140
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:18,039
You're even crappier than him.

141
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,980
Can I see these steps first?

142
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:25,609
Practicing outdoor is not so bad, actually. The weather today is perfect.

143
00:10:25,609 --> 00:10:27,739
Phukong has improved a lot.

144
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,209
Seeing them like this makes me relieved.

145
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,446
They're all improving.

146
00:10:32,446 --> 00:10:34,353
Should we pause here?

147
00:10:34,353 --> 00:10:37,960
I think so.

148
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,199
Guys, let's call it a day.

149
00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:44,040
Don't forget to practice at home.

150
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,252
We might need to practice outdoor for a while.

151
00:10:46,253 --> 00:10:50,299
Because it would be difficult for the music club to move.

152
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,409
Let's say we are doing this for our university.

153
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:57,719
But when I walked past their room, they were unusually quiet.

154
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,713
Welcome to call back service.

155
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,300
When did you get home?

156
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,090
I feel really sticky.

157
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:55,219
Where have you been? I couldn't reach you.

158
00:11:55,219 --> 00:11:57,253
My phone died.

159
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,153
We were…

160
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:03,300
We rented a studio off campus to practice.

161
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,369
What?

162
00:12:04,369 --> 00:12:08,139
Wat, I know you want to practice off-campus.

163
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:11,520
But look at the condition here. I don't think it'll work.

164
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,970
This is the best we've got around here.

165
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,579
I don't want to practice at the club.

166
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,840
Don't want to fight with your wife, you mean?

167
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,693
I can tell.

168
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,759
That's why I want you guys to practice in a nice place.

169
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,550
If you win, you can spend that money on a soundproof room.

170
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,640
And you don't need to fight with him anymore.

171
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,340
What are you suggesting?

172
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,973
We agreed to…

173
00:12:33,973 --> 00:12:36,140
practice at P'Dim's house for two weeks.

174
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,920
Two weeks?

175
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,680
Right.

176
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,030
It's not like I want to go.

177
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,720
But it's a good idea.

178
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,293
We can both focus on our clubs.

179
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:55,453
Don't be upset. Come here.

180
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,369
- Miss me already?
- It's two damn weeks.

181
00:12:59,369 --> 00:13:03,659
It's just two weeks. It's not like I'm dying next month.

182
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,740
I will come back to you.

183
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,799
You do your job and I will practice my music.

184
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,289
When we win, we will be together again. Okay?

185
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,330
It's two weeks!

186
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,619
Oh, there, there. Someone is pouting.

187
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,804
See you. Bye.

188
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:26,033
Get home safe.

189
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,189
Make time to play soccer with me, too. Don't forget.

190
00:13:40,189 --> 00:13:41,913
See you.

191
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,225
When you're done, please keep it in my workshop room. Here is the sandpaper.

192
00:14:04,225 --> 00:14:07,300
Do you think my makeup is too heavy?

193
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,853
No.

194
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,889
Shampoo?

195
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,790
I'll borrow Temp's.

196
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,489
Toothbrush?

197
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:41,509
I will… buy a new one.

198
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,959
Does P'Dim have a spare towel for you?

199
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:49,146
I have my own. I'm not borrowing his.

200
00:14:49,146 --> 00:14:51,150
Give it here. I'll pack it for you.

201
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,209
You're helping me pack?

202
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:55,843
Right.

203
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,410
Hey! I'm taking this with me.

204
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,439
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

205
00:15:12,439 --> 00:15:14,929
It is a rare item.

206
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,330
You can't just go buy it anywhere.

207
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,966
Come to think of it.

208
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:29,180
We've never been apart for this long

209
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,470
if we don't count when we had a fight.

210
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,850
P'Dim already graduated. Why is he still here messing things up?

211
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,153
I think…

212
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:46,039
it's not a coincidence I decided to compete in this event.

213
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,259
What do you mean?

214
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,193
It's…

215
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:55,103
Come and hear it.

216
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:01,840
After I saw you at the Scrubb concert.

217
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,830
Remember?

218
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:07,340
I went looking for you at every concert that Scrubb played.

219
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:13,000
University concerts, temple fairs, bar concerts, and high school events.

220
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,200
I went literally everywhere.

221
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,400
But I never found you.

222
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,833
Until this last one.

223
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,186
I saw one guy.

224
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,439
He looked exactly like you.

225
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,066
He was wearing a white shirt and jeans.

226
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,300
What's up?

227
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,430
Did you find that smiley guy of yours?

228
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:51,140
I didn't. I've looked for him everywhere.

229
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,053
I guess I failed again.

230
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:57,750
I started questioning myself about what I was doing.

231
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,610
Why did I bring myself to disappointment over and over?

232
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:04,249
It was time for me to get over you.

233
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,679
It was when I heard P'Dim's voice.

234
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,533
To those who are discouraged and giving up.

235
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,780
You might have just 1% chance,

236
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:16,280
but if your heart still wants to keep going,

237
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,550
that chance will never reduce to 0%.

238
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:21,660
This song is for those who are fighting for that 1%.

239
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,310
One day, your fight will pay off.

240
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,753
You know what?

241
00:17:44,753 --> 00:17:47,339
What P'Dim said that day

242
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,600
encouraged me to go on.

243
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,520
I applied to this university

244
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,013
because it's the place I met you.

245
00:17:57,013 --> 00:17:59,590
And I got to see you again at last.

246
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,133
Wait.

247
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:09,590
The event you were talking about was 2U?

248
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,119
Yes.

249
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,480
P'Dim signed up for the music contest that year and his band lost.

250
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,920
That's why I'm doing this for him this year.

251
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,359
More importantly,

252
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:25,679
he wants us to win so we can spend the prize on a soundproof studio.

253
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,280
And we don't have to fight ever again.

254
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,480
Damn!

255
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:36,459
I feel bad now. I just talked shit about him.

256
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,873
That's very touching.

257
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:49,480
Aww! Don't worry.

258
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,940
He's got good reasons.

259
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,286
By the way,

260
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:01,833
the guy I saw at the last concert, was it you?

261
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,360
I can't remember.

262
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,990
I went to many Scrubb shows as well.

263
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:09,350
It's no point thinking about it.

264
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,329
Because right now,

265
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,625
we are together.

266
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,166
I don't want to go to bed.

267
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,230
Would you like to take a walk with me?

268
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,693
Let's go.

269
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,830
Hey! What are you filming?

270
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,739
I'll watch it when you're not around.

271
00:19:47,739 --> 00:19:49,340
Nope.

272
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,700
Come on. Say something.

273
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,280
Something.

274
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,679
Say anything else.

275
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,919
Do it.

276
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,750
Give it here. I'm filming.

277
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,753
Hey! Give it back.

278
00:20:00,753 --> 00:20:02,640
Wait here. Just for a bit.

279
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,600
Do you want a video or not?

280
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,700
Here it is.

281
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,540
Wow! Thank you.

282
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,373
Sure.

283
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,550
Looks yummy, huh?

284
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:54,999
I was going to cook green curry for you this Saturday.

285
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,629
But you'll leave before that. The plan has already failed.

286
00:21:00,366 --> 00:21:02,766
Let's do it when I get back.

287
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,213
Let me taste it.

288
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,679
Have I told you?

289
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,420
Your instant noodles are the best.

290
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,492
Might be that it's a new flavor.

291
00:21:16,493 --> 00:21:19,173
I didn't add anything.

292
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,652
It's not about the flavor.

293
00:21:22,653 --> 00:21:24,400
It's because you added your love to it.

294
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,350
That's why it's better than any restaurant.

295
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,740
Did you forget anything?

296
00:21:46,633 --> 00:21:48,166
I did.

297
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,560
I forgot to grab your boobs.

298
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,980
You leave bruises all over them.

299
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,139
Why?

300
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:59,200
Do you want me to grab your boobs or kiss you till you drop?

301
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,270
Kiss me till I drop?

302
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,049
I hear that countless times.

303
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:08,450
And I haven't dropped yet.

304
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,920
Right.

305
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,400
Since you asked for it.

306
00:22:15,966 --> 00:22:17,916
You wanna drop, yeah?

307
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:22,700
Wat, I'm here to pick you up.

308
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,573
I'm going now.

309
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:40,210
Just call me when you have time.

310
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:42,790
Even if I don't have time, I will.

311
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,893
If you miss him, call him.

312
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:07,319
With great power comes great responsibility.

313
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,310
Ohm, you asshole!

314
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:12,319
He is sad. Stop teasing him.

315
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:14,300
I am not.

316
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,599
I'm reading movie quotes.

317
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,550
Spider Man, you know?

318
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:20,846
Why did I get kicked?

319
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,993
We talked.

320
00:23:22,993 --> 00:23:25,680
If he has time, he will call me.

321
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,920
If he doesn't, that means he's busy.

322
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,819
I've been busy too these days.

323
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,439
We don't have partners just to be with them all the time.

324
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,560
We have partners to remind ourselves that there's someone who loves us.

325
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,340
And now you know how to comfort your friend, too.

326
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,430
What are you talking about?

327
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:45,180
It's a quote from a movie, too. Bangkok Traffic Love Story.

328
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,653
Mei Li, you know?

329
00:23:47,653 --> 00:23:49,840
Don't you guys worry about me.

330
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,239
We talked it through.

331
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,960
We will both focus on our work.

332
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,673
So we don't think of something else.

333
00:23:56,673 --> 00:23:58,440
Eat up.

334
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:03,899
I'm full. I'm headed out.

335
00:24:03,899 --> 00:24:06,044
- See you.
- Aren't you going to eat this?

336
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:07,633
No. I'm full.

337
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,499
Can I have it then?

338
00:24:09,499 --> 00:24:11,233
Go ahead.

339
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,060
- What are you doing?
- Damn!

340
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,100
You scared me.

341
00:24:42,406 --> 00:24:46,856
When I'm not here, I can be sure you drink something healthy.

342
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,279
Wow! Real fruit juice from the farm?

343
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,313
High in vitamin C.

344
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:58,369
Healthy just like you said.

345
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,220
Of course, it is.

346
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,969
Look. My idea was all broken!

347
00:25:04,969 --> 00:25:06,840
Damn you!

348
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:09,200
What are you laughing at?

349
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,453
Wat.

350
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:58,693
♫ Time travels by so slowly ♫

351
00:25:58,693 --> 00:26:02,209
♫ How many days have come into your life? ♫

352
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:07,119
♫ How many days have you walked in and out of? ♫

353
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,826
♫ Are you still on your journey? ♫

354
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:16,480
♫ How many people have come into your life? ♫

355
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:22,140
♫ How many people have walked into your life and left? ♫

356
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:40,945
♫ Keep them, those good memories of you once loving each other ♫

357
00:26:40,946 --> 00:26:44,212
♫ Memories of you once loving each other ♫

358
00:26:44,213 --> 00:26:46,440
Wat, wake up.

359
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,550
As of late, the bed is just too big.

360
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,573
Tine.

361
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:03,900
♫ That day will be gone and will stay deep in your memories ♫

362
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,240
I bet you're lonely.

363
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,673
We started a war and now you're gone.

364
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:26,260
I told you to turn your clothes inside out before washing.

365
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,950
It's my shirt.

366
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:30,404
Mumbling? Hey!

367
00:27:33,826 --> 00:27:36,676
Someone forgot to turn his shirt inside out.

368
00:27:39,013 --> 00:27:41,620
Three, four...

369
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:44,100
Phukong, you're far behind!

370
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,230
I am sorry.

371
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,919
If you can't do it, you can leave the team.

372
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:49,939
Tine, he is doing his best.

373
00:27:49,939 --> 00:27:51,299
Do not put pressure on him.

374
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:54,673
We've given him so much time. Why…?

375
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:55,889
Pear, you're in charge.

376
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,723
Tine!

377
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,690
I hate myself today.

378
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,106
All right!

379
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:35,823
Damn you!

380
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,633
Phukong.

381
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,230
What's up?

382
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,809
Why are you guys practicing on the soccer field?

383
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:51,289
It's P'Tine. He wants us to be familiar with the location.

384
00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:54,729
Hey! Your P'Mil will play a warmup match here.

385
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:56,625
His team against ours.

386
00:28:56,626 --> 00:28:57,424
And?

387
00:28:57,425 --> 00:29:00,866
Well, you can… pretend to faint.

388
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:02,146
Get your answer today.

389
00:29:02,146 --> 00:29:04,773
You just run and then…

390
00:29:04,773 --> 00:29:08,573
Then P'Mil comes in.

391
00:29:08,573 --> 00:29:09,440
Like this.

392
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,673
No.

393
00:29:11,673 --> 00:29:15,040
If he liked me a bit, we'd be together by now.

394
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,529
Why are you backing off now?

395
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:20,946
Your big brother spent a year trying.

396
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,790
Thank you.

397
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:27,490
But I don't think I'll be as lucky as P'Wat.

398
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,913
Bye now.

399
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,830
Hey!

400
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:34,689
What? Don't give up now.

401
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:39,851
I'll take care of the team. You can handle the costumes, Tine. It's okay.

402
00:29:39,851 --> 00:29:43,989
Don't worry. Talk to you later. Bye.

403
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,359
Guys, the break is over.

404
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:47,989
Go to your position.

405
00:29:47,989 --> 00:29:51,740
Let me see your guard.

406
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,280
Smile. Smile.

407
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,759
Smile like we're about to win.

408
00:29:56,759 --> 00:29:58,406
Smile. Great!

409
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,640
Hey!

410
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,549
Phukong, are you okay? You seem kind of pale there.

411
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:06,539
- I am.
- Are you sure?

412
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:08,573
Hands down.

413
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,239
You look really pale. Are you all right?

414
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,630
Just a bit tired. I stayed up late working last night.

415
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,285
Do you want to take a break? You can.

416
00:30:16,285 --> 00:30:19,269
It's okay. I'm good.

417
00:30:19,269 --> 00:30:21,190
If anything at all, just let me know.

418
00:30:22,265 --> 00:30:25,059
Boss, sorry I tackled you last year.

419
00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:26,699
That's all right.

420
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:27,999
It's in the past.

421
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,980
Warriors and wounds always come in a package.

422
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:33,566
But this year, just be nice.

423
00:30:33,566 --> 00:30:36,979
Sure. Don't worry. Just a warmup match.

424
00:30:36,979 --> 00:30:38,683
Okay.

425
00:30:44,193 --> 00:30:45,900
I want to see 'Who Are We?'

426
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:49,820
Put all your effort into it this time. Okay?

427
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,187
Ready for Who Are We?

428
00:30:51,187 --> 00:30:52,280
Ready!

429
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,105
Three, four...

430
00:30:54,106 --> 00:30:55,400
One, two, three.

431
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:59,333
♪ Who are we? Who are we? ♪

432
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:06,510
Ouch!

433
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:08,089
Damn it!

434
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:09,659
This is just like a flashback.

435
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,460
Are you all right?

436
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,090
Warmup, my ass!

437
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:15,610
I am sorry.

438
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:20,060
♪ Who are we? Who are we? ♪

439
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,330
Again!

440
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:27,360
♪ Who are we? Who are we? ♪

441
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,860
Hey!! Phukong!! Hey!! Phukong!!

442
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,870
Phukong!

443
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,470
Are you okay?

444
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,880
Phukong!

445
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,020
Hey! What's wrong?

446
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,540
Phukong.

447
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,460
Step back.

448
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,073
Phukong.

449
00:31:47,073 --> 00:31:48,630
What's wrong with him?

450
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:51,506
I don't know. He looks pale. He might have a fever.

451
00:31:51,506 --> 00:31:54,710
One second he was dancing and then he fell to the ground.

452
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:56,980
Let's go to a hospital.

453
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,680
Let me help.

454
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,870
It's okay.

455
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:05,760
You guys go on. I'll take care of him.

456
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,859
Okay.

457
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,580
- Are you sure?
- I am.

458
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,600
Please take care of him.

459
00:32:12,633 --> 00:32:13,933
Come on.

460
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,946
Hey, you!

461
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:36,980
Green said you stayed up so late working.

462
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,300
Welcome to the Faculty of Architecture.

463
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,100
I warned you before.

464
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,020
I'll let him know that you've woken up.

465
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,280
You brought me here?

466
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:54,613
I am sorry for the trouble.

467
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,173
Phukong,

468
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,870
what has been wrong with you lately?

469
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,860
Nothing is wrong.

470
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:12,230
Ever since you became a cheerleader, you've been weird.

471
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,260
Isn't it good for you?

472
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:18,990
You can play soccer all you want without me bothering you.

473
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:22,460
When did I ever say you were bothering me?

474
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,671
Hey! I'll be right back.

475
00:33:43,671 --> 00:33:45,223
Phukong!

476
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:53,510
I played soccer every night waiting for you to show up.

477
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:55,646
You never did.

478
00:33:55,646 --> 00:33:58,860
You wore too much makeup, so I got you a remover.

479
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,160
You were gone before I got a chance.

480
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,390
Tell me what's wrong.

481
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,720
Don't do anything like this.

482
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:21,453
If you don't like me, stay away from me.

483
00:34:21,453 --> 00:34:24,020
One-sided love is painful, you know?

484
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:32,860
Why do you like me? Tell me.

485
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,413
I don't know.

486
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,300
You're like my big brother, I guess.

487
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,719
Are you saying I'm crappy?

488
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,613
Yeah. I like crappy people.

489
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,520
When will you like me back?

490
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,510
It's tiring to run after you all the time.

491
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:54,866
If you don't like me, let me move on.

492
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,950
What do you want me to do?

493
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:07,220
We've always been like this since the start.

494
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:11,066
Do you want me to kiss you and act lovey-dovey?

495
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,250
Wouldn't that be weird?

496
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,870
What do you mean exactly?

497
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:20,580
All the things I just said,

498
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,740
don't you get it?

499
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,830
I am not sure.

500
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:28,590
Am I still your little brother now?

501
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,633
You are…

502
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,090
not my brother for quite some time.

503
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,300
This is brother zone.

504
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,960
Pat here.

505
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:06,640
Thank you for looking after Phukong.

506
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,305
Green will be there soon.

507
00:36:08,306 --> 00:36:10,150
You can go home and rest.

508
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,783
Thank you.

509
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,959
Damn it!

510
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,410
Do you really need to update now?

511
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,179
Give it here. I'm filming.

512
00:37:51,179 --> 00:37:52,700
Hey!

513
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,519
What are you doing?

514
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,786
You wait here.

515
00:37:56,786 --> 00:37:58,380
Stay right there.

516
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,940
Stay right there.

517
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,739
Wat, are you done?

518
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,966
Save the battery.

519
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,373
Wat.

520
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:18,980
Why do you keep calling me?

521
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,120
What are you doing?

522
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,753
Take it back.

523
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:25,005
Did you just snoop around my phone?

524
00:38:25,005 --> 00:38:26,500
What is there to see?

525
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,173
Your gallery is full of my pictures.

526
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,819
Watch it later.

527
00:38:35,819 --> 00:38:37,586
Save it until…

528
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:43,740
Until one day you miss me really bad. You can watch it then.

529
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:47,220
I doubt that day will come at all.

530
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,686
We will see about that.

531
00:38:50,686 --> 00:38:52,613
No way.

532
00:39:00,813 --> 00:39:02,733
What should I say?

533
00:39:02,733 --> 00:39:04,780
Should I sing you a song?

534
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:07,470
You'll make me sing Scrubb songs for sure.

535
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,720
I'm sick of your list already.

536
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:13,580
Let's… Let's hear a secret I've never told you.

537
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,720
You know what, Tine?

538
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:19,060
The day I saw you again,

539
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:25,386
I freaking cried.

540
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,930
Of course, I did. I lost 1,000 baht to Man.

541
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:36,513
I told him that if I saw you again,

542
00:39:36,513 --> 00:39:38,770
I'd pay him that amount.

543
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:43,326
I'm glad I did though.

544
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,726
What else?

545
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:50,473
You and I…

546
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:54,440
We never really talked about our feelings.

547
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:56,860
That's right.

548
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,493
Never.

549
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:05,020
I said I liked you once in the "Your Smile" video I recorded for you.

550
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,610
You too.

551
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:10,230
You said you liked me once and you've never said it again.

552
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:13,580
All you do is bug me over and over these days.

553
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,320
You think I'm going to confess, don't you?

554
00:40:20,313 --> 00:40:22,046
Listen carefully.

555
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:25,293
I will say it only once.

556
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,920
I bet you're listening so carefully now.

557
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,913
Okay.

558
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,993
Though you like to nag me,

559
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,226
steal my food,

560
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:48,713
always demand what you want,

561
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:52,530
and like to think it all in your head,

562
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:57,939
I still…

563
00:40:57,939 --> 00:41:00,373
Wat.

564
00:41:00,373 --> 00:41:04,999
Are you done? Save my battery.

565
00:41:04,999 --> 00:41:08,799
Look at yourself. This is just how you are.

566
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,029
Fine! I won't say it.

567
00:41:12,029 --> 00:41:15,519
Wat!! Just a second.

568
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:17,520
I'm not saying it.

569
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,393
I will say it when I get back.

570
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:41,579
You're crappy. Why is it so hard to say?

571
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:54,320
You have dragged me to this point.

572
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:59,700
The point where I'm talking to your doll all alone.

573
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:04,993
When you're here, all I did was complain.

574
00:42:04,993 --> 00:42:08,219
But you always did something that bothered me, too.

575
00:42:08,219 --> 00:42:10,689
You didn't turn your clothes.

576
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:14,120
You liked to steal my stuff.

577
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:19,000
And you wanted to grab my boobs all the time.

578
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:24,320
Now, you're not here.

579
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:28,753
You know I'd let you do anything to me...

580
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:34,170
in exchange for you to come back.

581
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:43,706
Just like you said.

582
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:48,506
I must be patient.

583
00:42:48,506 --> 00:42:51,240
I must be strong.

584
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:57,020
I'll wait until this event is over.

585
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:01,000
I'll wait until we meet again.

586
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:11,840
What I want to tell you right now is…

587
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:26,933
I miss you so bad, Wat.

588
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:31,210
I miss you so damn much too, Tine.

589
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:45,946
P'Type.

590
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:52,669
Your new job has just started. Can you even take days off?

591
00:43:52,669 --> 00:43:54,879
I came back to get my documents.

592
00:43:54,879 --> 00:43:59,789
Man told me you were alone. I knew right away you'd be lonely.

593
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,749
I thought I wouldn't be.

594
00:44:03,749 --> 00:44:09,149
But after being alone for a while, I started to feel kind of empty.

595
00:44:09,149 --> 00:44:11,639
How can you even do it?

596
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:15,879
Only a few days without him makes me suffer this bad.

597
00:44:15,879 --> 00:44:20,599
You don't get to see Man for months. How can you not go crazy?

598
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:24,909
This is real life.

599
00:44:24,909 --> 00:44:27,319
You'll need to go through tests like this.

600
00:44:27,319 --> 00:44:30,669
My test is the distance.

601
00:44:30,669 --> 00:44:33,829
For some other couples, their test is the people around them.

602
00:44:33,829 --> 00:44:37,960
And the test for your couple is duty.

603
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:42,299
No matter how much you love each other, it can find a way to come between you two.

604
00:44:42,299 --> 00:44:45,880
It's stronger than the yellow tape I once used with you.

605
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:57,179
When he was here, I wanted to do many things for him but never got time to do it.

606
00:44:57,179 --> 00:44:59,566
Same here.

607
00:44:59,566 --> 00:45:01,819
When he comes back,

608
00:45:01,819 --> 00:45:05,726
I'll make him green curry every day until he's sick of it.

609
00:45:05,726 --> 00:45:08,399
You only say that when he's not around.

610
00:45:08,399 --> 00:45:12,819
I bet you'll become lazy again when he gets back. Believe me.

611
00:45:12,819 --> 00:45:15,019
Is this the truth of real life, too?

612
00:45:15,019 --> 00:45:16,553
Right.

613
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:20,339
Thank you for staying with me.

614
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:25,230
But you can stay with Man tomorrow. I am okay.

615
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:27,959
It's good you're okay. Besides,

616
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:30,950
I never intended to stay with you for two nights.

617
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,149
You fell real hard too, huh?

618
00:45:37,149 --> 00:45:39,166
Don't you tease me.

619
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:49,519
I'm your brother. I never got to taste your green curry.

620
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:50,919
You can cook it yourself.

621
00:45:50,919 --> 00:45:52,353
What?

622
00:45:55,070 --> 00:45:57,170
Can you even cook green curry?

623
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,040
I watched it on YouTube.

624
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:07,799
I'm about to practice. You?

625
00:46:07,799 --> 00:46:12,669
About to get to guitar practice. They're calling me now.

626
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:16,519
Hold on. Before you hang up, what should you say?

627
00:46:16,519 --> 00:46:18,639
What? No!

628
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:21,346
Come on! I want to hear it.

629
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:25,139
I miss you.

630
00:46:25,139 --> 00:46:28,699
What? I couldn't hear you.

631
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,433
I miss you.

632
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:36,273
I miss you, too.

633
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:40,159
- See you.
- See you.

634
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:46,539
Well, well. You're like a teenager in love.

635
00:46:46,539 --> 00:46:48,599
What?

636
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,993
I'm envious.

637
00:46:50,993 --> 00:46:53,059
I'm so in love. That's why.

638
00:46:53,059 --> 00:46:56,159
Why are you envious?

639
00:46:56,159 --> 00:47:00,339
Though your boyfriend is far away, you still have a friend here.

640
00:47:00,339 --> 00:47:03,699
Don't worry. I'll treat you to BBQ pork buffet today.

641
00:47:03,699 --> 00:47:06,753
- You gave your word?
- Of course.

642
00:47:06,753 --> 00:47:09,409
That's awesome! Thanks, my friend.

643
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:11,913
Wanna join us? It's my treat.

644
00:47:11,913 --> 00:47:14,960
I'm busy. Cheerleading practice.

645
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:20,280
Since he became a cheerleader with a boyfriend, our BBQ pork has been abandoned completely.

646
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,649
Is he really busy practicing?

647
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:26,233
- Of course.
- Okay. You just saved my money. See you, bro.

648
00:47:26,233 --> 00:47:28,790
See you later. Next time.

649
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:30,965
Are you all right?

650
00:47:30,965 --> 00:47:32,059
I am.

651
00:47:32,059 --> 00:47:34,040
Boss!

652
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:36,450
What happened to your leg?

653
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:43,419
I played soccer with P'Mil, and I got tackled.

654
00:47:43,419 --> 00:47:45,763
Let me see.

655
00:47:45,763 --> 00:47:50,129
Aren't you going to clean it? It might swell if you leave it be.

656
00:47:50,129 --> 00:47:53,566
Do you want to go to my faculty's infirmary?

657
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,909
Are you sure about that? Should we go now?

658
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:03,566
BBQ pork is not good for my wound.

659
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:06,866
BBQ pork is not good for my wound. I can't eat it.

660
00:48:06,866 --> 00:48:09,680
My wound will be swollen.

661
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:12,370
Ouch!

662
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,785
It hurts.

663
00:48:16,785 --> 00:48:18,686
Does it really hurt?

664
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:21,933
But you seemed okay just now…

665
00:48:21,933 --> 00:48:23,806
It does.

666
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:26,940
Sorry. Ouch! It hurts.

667
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:29,010
(What about me?)

668
00:48:29,013 --> 00:48:31,799
- Are you sure?
- I am.

669
00:48:31,799 --> 00:48:33,733
Slow down.

670
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:38,993
Pear, slow down.

671
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:57,960
Did you bring anyone here when I was away?

672
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,890
When did you come? Huh?

673
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,393
The familiar scent of you.

674
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,200
This is the familiar scent of you, too.

675
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,850
Yeah?

676
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:15,959
Right. You stink.

677
00:49:15,959 --> 00:49:18,544
Go take a shower. I'm eating.

678
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,560
No more eating food.

679
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:25,593
I am eating you.

680
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,160
Did you miss me?

681
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,800
No, I guess.

682
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,609
You never say sweet words to me.

683
00:49:36,609 --> 00:49:38,960
Answer me nicely and I'll let you go.

684
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:42,429
- I missed you.
- Huh?

685
00:49:42,429 --> 00:49:44,109
I missed you.

686
00:49:44,109 --> 00:49:46,143
What?

687
00:49:46,143 --> 00:49:47,723
I missed you.

688
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:50,846
I missed you, too.

689
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:54,819
You said you'd let me go.

690
00:49:54,819 --> 00:49:58,909
No. I missed you so much. Let's eat.

691
00:49:58,909 --> 00:49:59,969
You said you'd let go.

692
00:49:59,969 --> 00:50:02,260
No. I'm hungry.

693
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:07,140
One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two.

694
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:14,269
Okay, guys. You did a great job.

695
00:50:14,269 --> 00:50:16,440
Let's gather round here.

696
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,239
Tomorrow is the big day we've waited for.

697
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:26,839
I know it's been exhausting for all of you.

698
00:50:26,839 --> 00:50:30,619
Some of you even had a fight with your loved ones.

699
00:50:30,619 --> 00:50:34,029
Some of you missed nice trips with your friends.

700
00:50:34,029 --> 00:50:36,959
Some of you were on a strict diet to look perfect.

701
00:50:36,959 --> 00:50:38,859
And Phukong…

702
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:44,710
You worked and practiced so hard… that you collapsed.

703
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:51,069
Thank you all for your dedication. Thank you so much.

704
00:50:51,069 --> 00:50:53,626
It's tomorrow, guys.

705
00:50:53,626 --> 00:50:56,729
It's time to show them

706
00:50:56,729 --> 00:51:00,806
how great we are.

707
00:51:00,806 --> 00:51:02,849
- Fight or give up?
- Fight!

708
00:51:02,849 --> 00:51:04,779
- Fight or give up?
- Fight!

709
00:51:04,779 --> 00:51:08,086
- Fight or give up?
- Fight!

710
00:51:08,086 --> 00:51:10,293
See you tomorrow.

711
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:14,239
See you tomorrow, everyone. Get home safe.

712
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:17,459
Goodbye. Get some rest.

713
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:21,710
Hang in there, bro.

714
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:23,453
Get some sleep.

715
00:51:23,453 --> 00:51:25,373
Bye.

716
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:26,944
Bye.

717
00:51:26,945 --> 00:51:28,191
- See you.
- Bye.

718
00:51:28,191 --> 00:51:29,799
Bye.

719
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,584
See you. Get home safe.

720
00:51:31,584 --> 00:51:32,719
Bye. Fighting!

721
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:34,253
Bye.

723
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:22,659
Hello! It's the biggest rehearsal today and they need an audience.

724
00:52:22,659 --> 00:52:26,653
So I just called out randomly.

725
00:52:26,653 --> 00:52:31,659
You happened to be the lucky one. So, please be the audience for them.

726

My first relationship has become a long-distance one.

745
00:54:39,304 --> 00:54:41,569
Sathorn and Ladprao? This is your long distance?

746

I missed you.
