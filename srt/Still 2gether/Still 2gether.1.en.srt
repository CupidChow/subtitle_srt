1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,199
Hi, guys. I am Tine, Mr. Chic. And this guy next to me is…

2
00:00:04,199 --> 00:00:05,870
Tine's boyfriend.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,710
What? Am I not?

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,539
Hi, guys. I am Tine, Mr. Chic.

5
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:15,919
And this guy is Sarawat. Want to know how we met?

6
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:19,510
It started out when someone confessed his feelings to me.

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,110
I rejected and turned him down many times.

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,209
He never left.

9
00:00:24,209 --> 00:00:28,239
So I asked this guy to pretend to hit on me and be my shield.

10
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:30,939
Not only did I get rejected…

11
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:35,599
Keep looking at me like that… and I will kiss you till you drop.

12
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:39,090
Look at him. I didn't give up, though.

13
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,720
I tried to join the music club just to pursue him.

14
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,800
He didn't know he failed the audition.

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,239
I was the one that begged the seniors to accept him.

16
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:49,990
Actually, I'd had a crush on him for a long time.

17
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,570
So I was fooled big time.

18
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,440
I thought he was pretending. But no. He hit on me for real.

19
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:58,329
In the end, this little buffalo became mine.

20
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:04,019
We've been together for over a year now.

21
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,359
Many things have changed.

22
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:11,410
We moved to a new place that is closer to the university.

23
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,069
I got a new guitar. And he got… You should see it for yourself.

24
00:01:16,069 --> 00:01:17,899
- Do you like it?
- Of course.

25
00:01:17,899 --> 00:01:19,779
- I like it, too.
- You mean the speaker?

26
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:21,383
I mean you.

27
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,490
Wat, have you seen my laundry basket?

28
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:25,820
At the same spot.

29
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,120
You can use mine. We live together now. What's the problem?

30
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:30,929
- At the same spot?
- Ouch!

31
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,130
Tine, what the heck are you playing?

32
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,299
Our sweet level, which is usually low, slowly hit rock bottom.

33
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:39,650
Chaos has completely replaced it.

34
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,060
Wat, wake up! Wat!

35
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,770
Wat!

36
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:52,960
Damn it! Again?

37
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,899
Tine, come closer.

38
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,339
Stop!

39
00:02:01,339 --> 00:02:04,640
I already washed my face.

40
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,499
Frozen food is high in sodium. I don't want to eat this.

41
00:02:07,499 --> 00:02:10,859
Quit complaining. We're blessed to have food on the table.

42
00:02:10,859 --> 00:02:16,759
Nope. You used to cook me Green Curry and Stewed Pork with Eggs every day.

43
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:18,329
Are you going to eat or not?

44
00:02:18,329 --> 00:02:20,050
Yes, dear.

45
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,000
Tine, have you seen my sausages?

46
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,339
Where are they?

47
00:02:37,339 --> 00:02:39,440
You ate them already, maybe?

48
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:44,099
Hey, Tine! Give it back.

49
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:47,219
- It's mine now.
- Spit it out.

50
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,799
- Wat.
- What?

51
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:57,279
I told you to turn your clothes inside out before washing. Do it now.

52
00:02:57,279 --> 00:03:00,179
- Here!
- It's my shirt.

53
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:02,379
- Mumbling?
- Hey!

54
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:09,929
Sometimes I wonder if other couples in a long relationship

55
00:03:09,929 --> 00:03:11,879
are like us.

56
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:14,759
P'Type, I have finished the washing.

57
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,770
Do you want me to hang them now?

58
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:22,199
I told you a million times. Before washing clothes, you need to empty the pockets first.

59
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:25,259
Look! Bits of tissues are all over.

60
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:27,140
Get rid of them.

61
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,339
I get you now, Wat.

62
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:34,549
They are so alike, these two brothers.

63
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:35,859
What are you saying?

64
00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:39,999
Nothing. I'm just cleaning them.

65
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,220
I wonder if other couples are like us.

66
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,409
You are such a lovely kid.

67
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:54,059
Thanks.

68
00:03:54,059 --> 00:03:56,460
I tricked you to help me build this model and you fell for it.

69
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,599
I thought you wanted to see a movie.

70
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,329
What are you mumbling about?

71
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:03,963
Nothing.

72
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,079
Too much glue there. Put the lid on.

73
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:11,189
I think dating is only the beginning. We will have to face a lot more.

74
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:13,759
But if our hands are held tightly enough,

75
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,490
no matter what there is waiting for us,

76
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,490
we will go through it eventually.

77
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:22,160
Because we are together.

78
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,540
No. Because we are still together.

79
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:51,800
♫ We see each other every day, and every day is different ♫

80
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:58,660
♫ It seemed like there was no way, how could we fall in love? ♫

81
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,730
♫ But because of our closeness, there are no more excuses ♫

82
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:08,320
♫ I wasn't prepared for these wrong sparks in my heart ♫

83
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,660
♫ I used to be a person who never understood ♫

84
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:22,900
♫ I'm so addicted to you that I accidentally and
unconsciously fell in love with you ♫

85
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:31,400
♫ I've been caught in your trap, how can I resist your heart? ♫

86
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,320
♫ Excuse me for causing confusion ♫

87
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,270
♫ I'm sorry that my heart wants to have you by my side ♫

88
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:47,500
♫ Just being able to love you,
I can't force myself to forget about you ♫

89
00:05:47,500 --> 00:06:01,400
♫ I've fallen in love with you,
I can't force myself to forget about you ♫

90
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,109
Wow! Wow!

91
00:06:06,109 --> 00:06:11,609
And that was the story of WatTine, the hottest couple in our university.

92
00:06:11,609 --> 00:06:16,599
Before we say goodbye, can you please do a cute couple pose for the fans

93
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:20,390
so they can capture and ship you two even more?

94
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,910
What are you doing?

95
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:30,249
Sarawat come on! The fans want to ship you two.

96
00:06:30,249 --> 00:06:32,270
Why do I need to?

97
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:37,479
All right, guys. Let's say goodbye right here.

98
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:42,199

100
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:49,459
Have a great day, guys. Bye.

101
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:50,979
Cut!

102
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:53,609
Sarawat! Can't you just do this one thing?

103
00:06:53,609 --> 00:06:55,889
The fans need something to ship and dream about.

104
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:58,099
Ship what?

105
00:06:58,099 --> 00:07:02,679
We are a real couple. This is real sweetness.

106
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:04,940
Do we need to show them?

107
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,459
Whatever you say, boss.

108
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:11,639
When we earn some money or get sponsored, I will pay you two. Okay?

109
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,079
Green, you should pay me.

110
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:16,759
I'm a cameraman and a video editor. I should be paid.

111
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:19,720
But I already paid you with my body, dear.

112
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:25,860
Tine, when you are free, can I get a solo interview from you again?

113
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,909
But I just said everything.

114
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:29,800
You sure?

115
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,039
There's still one thing people want to know.

116
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:36,380
About Pam.

117
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:40,299
They want to know how things were.

118
00:07:40,299 --> 00:07:43,459
People gossip about Sarawat hugging her.

119
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:49,099
And when you were in the hospital, Sarawat didn't take care of you, Tine.

120
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:52,939
Green, who said Sarawat didn't go and take care of him?

121
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:56,579
What? You were there taking care of me?

122
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:02,779
I just realized I forgot to shut off the gas valve at home.

123
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:05,629
You didn't forget but you're about to start a fire here. Let's go.

124
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:07,999
Oops! The fire is burning!

125
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:11,760
P'Dim, let's run!

126
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,340
We should go, too.

127
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,400
What did P'Dim mean?

128
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,370
Did you come to the hospital?

129
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,239
Is there anything else I don't know about?

130
00:08:29,239 --> 00:08:31,290
What do you want to know?

131
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,830
I know it was a long time ago,

132
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,450
but it is still stuck in my head.

133
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,160
Why did you two hug?

134
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:49,529
It was a difficult situation for me. Pam is my close friend.

135
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,500
She was crying.

136
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:56,010
I just meant to comfort her and then follow you.

137
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,440
That's true.

138
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,719
Then what? You let P'Mil take me to the hospital.

139
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:08,180
You were sick. Did you really want me to start a fight?

140
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,220
Actually, I was there next to you all night.

141
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,409
I went home and changed the next morning.

142
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,690
When I came back to you, you refused to talk to me.

143
00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:21,019
It wasn't funny.

144
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:27,519
Not just that, I found your bracelet left in our place.

145
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,270
I thought you didn't want to see me again.

146
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,719
Why didn't you tell me?

147
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,150
You didn't ask.

148
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:40,190
Let bygones be bygones. We shouldn't bring it up.

149
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,729
Tine, you are my first boyfriend.

150
00:09:52,729 --> 00:09:57,110
Sometimes we don't realize we make a mistake until it already happened.

151
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,320
I might make mistakes from time to time...

152
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,370
but I never intend to hurt you.

153
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,993
I am sorry.

154
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,590
I am sorry, too.

155
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,619
I am sorry I jumped to conclusions so easily.

156
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,439
From this day on, whatever is in our minds,

157
00:10:23,439 --> 00:10:25,780
we need to have a heart-to-heart talk.

158
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,069
- Promise?
- Promise.

159
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,160
I need to be frank with you now.

160
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,300
- Can I grab your boobs?
- Hey!

161
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,429
Again? Hey!

162
00:10:48,429 --> 00:10:51,140
What a perv!

163
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:55,209
Wait! I am meeting P'Fang for lunch.

164
00:10:55,209 --> 00:10:57,260
A meal with codeshare students.

165
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,829
Shit! I am late. I need to go now.

166
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:04,659
See you at home. Bye.

167
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:18,149
Eat up. It's my treat.

168
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:23,780
But don't order meat dishes. Order vegetables.

169
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,779
Pass that over here.

170
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,699
Why are you late?

171
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,959
I am sorry.

172
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,679
Hold on! Who said you could sit?

173
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,740
You kept us waiting. You will be punished.

174
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:37,369
I am punished anyway even if I am on time.

175
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:40,359
Everyone, listen up.

176
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,770
This is P'Tine, the legendary chic guy of our codeshare.

177
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:45,659
He will show us his moves. Want to see?

178
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:48,550
Yeah!

179
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,739
I already did it last year.

180
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,539
Do I need to do it again?

181
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,020
That's right. Now get up.

182
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,230
You do it with me.

183
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,749
No. Just you. Do it fiercely.

184
00:11:58,749 --> 00:12:03,030
- Perform with me.
- No way. You do it!

185
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:07,470
Show us your introduction.

186
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:12,219
My name is Tine. I am a chic guy. I like to act cute. I can be top but the bottom is also fine.

187
00:12:12,219 --> 00:12:15,961
I like to strike hard!

188
00:12:15,961 --> 00:12:18,620
Do it again. Make it harder.

189
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,000
That's it!

190
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,330
I couldn't hear you.

191
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,400
Sarawat!

192
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,470
Wat, why are you here?

193
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:36,840
What was that dance? It's like a kid's dance.

194
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,160
I know you are shy. Right?

195
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,500
You've got a backup here.

196
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,070
Wat,

197
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:45,049
if you love him, dance with him.

198
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,620
Perfect!

199
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,819
I forgot my phone somewhere.

200
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,079
Sarawat, come here.

201
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,279
Go on.

202
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,430
Give it up for them if you want to see.

203
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,249
- Come on.
- I am out.

204
00:12:57,249 --> 00:12:58,849
Hold on.

205
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,619
Stay.

206
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,553
Ready?

207
00:13:02,553 --> 00:13:06,339
My name is Tine. I am a chic guy. I like to act cute.

208
00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:08,630
Come on. Be cute.

209
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:12,209
My name is Tine. I am a chic guy. I like to act cute.

210
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:15,810
Cute. Cute.

211
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:18,059
Really? Cute. Cute.

212
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,950
I can be top but the bottom is also fine.

213
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,220
I like to strike hard!

214
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,890
Why are you smiling?

215
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,910
I just… smile for a cutie.

216
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,631
He gets a head pat.

217
00:13:33,631 --> 00:13:37,420
All right, guys. Come and have a seat.

218
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,820
Should we go now?

219
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,560
I am waiting for Tine.

220
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,899
I will see you later then.

221
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,009
Hold on.

222
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:50,343
What is it?

223
00:13:50,343 --> 00:13:53,060
I have something to talk to you about.

224
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,040
Here. Pillowcases.

225
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,039
They're a different color.

226
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,439
Come on. It doesn't matter.

227
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,299
They don't go well together.

228
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,633
Get new ones.

229
00:14:12,633 --> 00:14:13,919
Blue is pretty.

230
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,080
Nope. Get the ones in the same color.

231
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,199
By the way, P'Fang asked me something.

232
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,100
P'Dim asked me something, too.

233
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,020
Really?

234
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,060
You first then.

235
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,319
P'Dim graduated.

236
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,760
He said… he doesn't have much time for the club.

237
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,170
He asked me to be the club president.

238
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:41,629
Yeah? What did you say?

239
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:44,600
What else could I say?

240
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,440
I have my condition though.

241
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,129
You have to be my… secretary.

242
00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:55,339
I want to. But…

243
00:14:55,339 --> 00:14:58,590
But P'Fang asked you to be a cheerleading club president.

244
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,620
It's hard to say no to her.

245
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:09,980
Hey! But I want to work with you.

246
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:15,119
That's okay. I understand.

247
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,600
What are you doing now?

248
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,420
Testing the sheets.

249
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,670
Soft as always.

250
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,209
Testing the sheets? I'll go…

251
00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:31,443
No!

252
00:15:31,443 --> 00:15:32,510
Let's do this.

253
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:35,590
I will help you make the decision.

254
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:40,330
Choose 1 or 2?

255
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:45,180
If I choose 1, I am your secretary.

256
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:49,150
If I choose 2, your secretary is me.

257
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:54,470
Whatever I choose, I end up being your secretary.

258
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,619
Clever. Little buffalo.

259
00:15:57,619 --> 00:15:59,800
What a cheater!

260
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,699
So? Yes or no?

261
00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:05,840
Fine. It's a yes.

262
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:10,570
Should a secretary start working tonight?

263
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:14,290
You can start right now.

264
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,619
- Hi.
- You're here!

265
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,659
Come on. Have a seat.

266
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:33,350
Tine, you sit here.

267
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,000
Wat, move a bit left.

268
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,340
Left, please.

269
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,519
I mean your right.

270
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,360
Your right.

271
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,830
That's it.

272
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,630
Pick up the guitar.

273
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,699
Okay. Thanks for taking the job.

274
00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:54,369
Let's not waste any more time. Let's shoot. It's your script.

275
00:16:54,369 --> 00:16:56,810
Don't worry too much about it.

276
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,100
What is this?

277
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,490
A Live. Ask people to join our club.

278
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,289
You didn't have to do anything like this.

279
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:08,729
It's a new normal.

280
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:11,580
Social media is a must.

281
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,769
Especially you, Wat. You need to be more friendly.

282
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:16,559
People are coming.

283
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,479
- Should we start now?
- Be friendly.

284
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,739
But I…

285
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,010
Five, four, three, two...

286
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,170
Anything.

287
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,693
Tine.

288
00:17:34,961 --> 00:17:36,819
Hi, guys. I am Tine, Mr. Chic.

289
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,689
I am a club secretary.

290
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,890
This is Sarawat. He is the club president.

291
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:46,740
We're going to tell you what is special about our club.

292
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,449
We have so many Likes. Do something cute.

293
00:17:50,449 --> 00:17:53,099
Give them a mini heart.

294
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,400
Students from our university are watching.

295
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,230
"P'Tine, can I be your fan?"

296
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:02,839
Sure. Please apply for the music club.

297
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,519
"You two are so hot."

298
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,940
"P'Tine is so cute."

299
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,830
Wave for them.

300
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:20,189
I might not be so smiley, but I can play guitar.

301
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,559
There's a new comment.

302
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,330
"P'Sarawat, can you play a song to hit on us?"

303
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,163
Of course.

304
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:44,030
♪ Time has brought us together ♪

305
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:51,669
♪ The bond we create each day is getting more
and more meaningful ♪

306
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:09,500
I am home. Did you miss me?

307
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,860
I did.

308
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,710
I wonder when you will stop putting these used papers in the printer.

309
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,199
It's good I saw them first. If I brought these to my boss, I'd be doomed.

310
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,700
I am sorry.

311
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,139
I just thought that we could use the other side.

312
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:33,050
Look! I bought you your favorites.

313
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,439
See? We have plenty.

314
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,140
Don't you know I am on a diet?

315
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,820
That's all right. I will eat them all.

316
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:44,679
No. I'm on a diet and so are you.

317
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:48,180
But this one is your ultimate favorite.

318
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,910
This one is super delicious.

319
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,460
Take off your shoes.

320
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,340
I do TikTok dance every single day. I'll never get fat.

321
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,840
What are you watching?

322
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,770
Watching the club president serving his fans.

323
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,673
Are you jealous?

324
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,959
Who is?

325
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,119
You just played a Scrubb song for your fans.

326
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,049
What is the reason to be?

327
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:39,450
Why don't you just throw a concert already?

328
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:43,570
Look! You sent them your mini heart!

329
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,599
You smiled for them from ear to ear.

330
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,169
Do I get to say anything?

331
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:51,880
I did what I was told.

332
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:56,120
Then why are you getting mad?

333
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:59,480
You said we would have a heart-to-heart talk.

334
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,639
Just admit you're jealous.

335
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,710
I am not jealous.

336
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:06,180
- You shouted. Not convincing.
- I am not jealous.

337
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,160
Still not convincing.

338
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,793
I am not.

339
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,290
Damn! You get jealous just because of a mini heart.

340
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,470
You're so cute.

341
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,020
I told you.

342
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:27,420
For other people, they need to force me to do it.

343
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:32,810
For you, I do it by heart, not by duty.

344
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,433
Cheesy.

345
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,480
So…

346
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,009
Can I hear one song now, my club president?

347
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:52,350
Of course, my dear secretary.

[Serviced Apartment & Restaurant]

360
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,109
It's late. Get some sleep.

361
00:23:01,109 --> 00:23:04,020
I am reading comments from our Live.

362
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:07,320
A lot of people are interested in joining our club.

363
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,460
[Is he the one who got in because he had connections?]

364
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,489
[I heard he didn't even pass the audition.]

365
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:20,210
[His hubby is the boss. That's why.]

366
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,829
Just don't read. It's full of rubbish comments.

367
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,010
Don't think about it.

368
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,200
I know.

369
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,840
You get some sleep. I'll listen to music.

370
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,299
No way. I won't let you be sad all alone again.

371
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,333
Get some sleep.

372
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,920
You will sleep now or do you want me to kiss you till you drop?

373
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,340
I've heard that for over a year now.

374
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,520
And I haven't dropped yet.

375
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,040
Are you challenging me?

376
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,019
I'll make you drop right now.

377
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,699
I am kidding. I will sleep now.

378
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,529
- Not sleeping?
- I am!

379
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:28,090
You're safe tonight.

380
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:29,610
All right?

381
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:31,510
I'll turn off the light.

382
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,580
You said I was safe.

383
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,920
Don't ask for it.

384
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,449
Get some sleep.

385
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:51,919
- Good night.
- Good night.

386
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,160
Stop reading it already.

387
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,119
Why are people so good at criticizing?

388
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,070
You realize that and you're reading them anyway.

389
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,960
Enough.

390
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,710
Hey! Phuak just yelled at us through his post.

391
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,199
He's mad because we didn't see him off.

392
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,659
But we got a test.

393
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,729
We threw him a farewell party yesterday. Why so demanding?

394
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,500
It's an exchange program for just a few months.

395
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,339
He is exaggerating.

396
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,720
Let me yell back.

397
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,279
See? You guys get hot-headed, too.

398
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,499
He is our friend.

399
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,439
But those comments you're reading are from people you don't know.

400
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,340
Their profile pictures aren't even themselves.

401
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:45,449
Fake profile pictures. But their comments are so harsh.

402
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,790
Exactly.

403
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:49,260
That's why I told you.

404
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,219
Couples shouldn't work together.

405
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:53,779
There're a lot of problems coming your way.

406
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,939
Why is that?

407
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:59,040
These trolls are all on team #SarawatsWives.

408
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:03,120
They see you guys spending time together and working together. They are envious.

409
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,270
That's why they dig up your past to sabotage you.

410
00:26:07,571 --> 00:26:11,779
But wow! If I were him, reading these comments, I'd quit immediately.

411
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:15,810
Ohm! Are you suggesting that he quit his relationship?

412
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:18,740
No! I mean quit being his secretary.

413
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,339
Quit being his secretary?

414
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,660
That's right.

415
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:34,939
Mine is empty. Can I have a sip?

416
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,969
Wow! You asshole!

417
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:40,620
Sorry about that.

418
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,140
Sorry, Boss.

419
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,773
Sorry.

420
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,080
I'll see you later then.

421
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,210
Boss! You've had your eyes on her for a year.

422
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:04,320
When will you make a move?

423
00:27:04,329 --> 00:27:07,280
She won't be single for long.

424
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:12,840
Today! I will join the music club.

425
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,820
Last year, WatTine couple happened.

426
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:21,519
This year, I will make BossPear happen.

427
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,589
- Pear resigned just now.
- What!?

428
00:27:23,589 --> 00:27:28,170
She wants to find what she really likes.

429
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:30,980
Do you still want to join now? Huh?

430
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,130
Go and figure out.

431
00:27:32,139 --> 00:27:34,979
Everyone, let's gather round.

432
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,659
Quickly!

433
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:40,719
Why so serious? Let's be joyful.

434
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:50,799
I have to say congratulations to everyone who passed this year's audition.

435
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:55,300
This year we get a new club room because the old one is under maintenance.

436
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,920
We also have a new club president and club secretary.

437
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,440
Want to meet them?

438
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,320
Please step in and welcome our new members.

439
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:14,189
Helo, everyone. I'm just here to kick off the event.

440
00:28:14,189 --> 00:28:16,690
Can I please not introduce myself?

441
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:26,009
I am Tine. I am a club secretary.

442
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,380
[Is he the one who got in because he had connections?]
[I heard he didn't even pass the audition.]

443
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,660
[His hubby is the boss. That's why.]

444
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,510
- So today…
- Many of you might be thinking…

445
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:49,640
I am here because of the connections I had.

446
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,090
That's true.

447
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:02,140
I didn't pass the audition.

448
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:07,260
I was accepted because I got some help.

449
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,980
My first stage performance,

450
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,200
I couldn't even finish the song.

451
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:20,540
So I am thinking, it's not fair to all of you

452
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,380
if I am the secretary.

453
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,540
What I am asking here is…

454
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:36,230
One week to practice guitar.

455
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:39,130
And I will audition for this club again.

456
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:55,110
♪ As long as… ♪

457
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,440
♪ As long as… ♪

458
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:05,140
♪ As long as I have you ♪

459
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,450
Tine, just stop.

460
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,000
It's not going to work.

461
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,849
What now? Did Wat ask you guys to talk to me?

462
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,783
- No.
- No.

463
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,340
- Really.
- Really.

464
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:32,849
Yes. He is worried about you.

465
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:35,959
So he asked us to talk you out of it.

466
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,530
Does he think I won't pass?

467
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:43,080
Not that. He just doesn't want you to care about those negative comments.

468
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:48,720
Hey! We can't care about everyone all the time.

469
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,800
Just care about those who care about us.

470
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,810
Wow! Here comes Fong The Philosopher.

471
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,860
Who said I cared about those comments?

472
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,280
I care about Sarawat.

473
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,520
I don't want anyone to talk behind his back that… he is unfair.

474
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,270
Tine spoke like a philosopher, too.

475
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:09,360
Only me left now.

476
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,410
Who are you talking to?

477
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:23,669
P'Mil, you know what? Of all the models we have built, this one is my favorite.

478
00:31:23,669 --> 00:31:25,560
It sure is.

479
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,680
I designed it just the way you like it.

480
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:31,343
It's our home.

481
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:34,520
What do you mean?

482
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,340
You once asked me to keep my heart open.

483
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,430
Now, I have the answer for you.

484
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,479
Phukong. Phukong!

485
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:54,279
I have the answer. The door is too large.

486
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,659
It is?

487
00:31:56,659 --> 00:31:57,839
Let's do it again.

488
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,673
Okay.

489
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,050
Phukong.

490
00:32:12,793 --> 00:32:15,260
Why did you choose the Faculty of Architecture?

491
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:19,200
I have my motivation.

492
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,493
P'Mil.

493
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:30,979
- After we finish this model…
- P'Mil, the soccer field is available.

494
00:32:30,979 --> 00:32:33,780
Great! Let's go.

495
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:38,349
Can you take care of the rest? I don't think I will come back.

496
00:32:38,349 --> 00:32:39,900
Wait up!

497
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,260
When you're done, keep it in my workshop room.

498
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,800
Here is the sandpaper.

499
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,500
- Let's go.
- What the heck!

500
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:52,110
When will I get to hear the answer?

501
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:01,899
Hey! The song you like, I learned all the chords.

502
00:33:01,899 --> 00:33:03,579
- Really?
- Yeah.

503
00:33:03,579 --> 00:33:05,119
I'll play it for you the next time.

504
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,410
I can't wait.

505
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:22,690
[Take a sad song and make it better]

506
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:25,919
Hey! You came so late.

507
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:32,080
Why are you here at this hour?

508
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:36,370
I came to borrow your guitar.

509
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:39,490
You are borrowing my guitar?

510
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,233
Why?

511
00:33:42,233 --> 00:33:47,100
To play and record a video.

512
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:57,660
Here. Who are you hitting on?

513
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,559
No one. Hit on? No way!

514
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,649
Really.

515
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:04,430
The video is for me to watch.

516
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:07,230
I am your brother. You can talk to me.

517
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,913
No one.

518
00:34:09,913 --> 00:34:11,740
Just want to play.

519
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,860
I'm thinking of writing a song, too.

520
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,359
Yeah?

521
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,940
Not just recording a video, but also writing a song.

522
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,840
What song?

523
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:25,320
A song about... someone whom we do everything for.

524
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,100
But we get brother-zoned in the end.

525
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:32,110
Are you really talking about the song?

526
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:34,659
Yeah! What are you laughing at?

527
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:37,280
You are so into the song. You know?

528
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,150
Into what?

529
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:44,470
You seem so hurt. How about we open bottles and drink?

530
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:48,719
Nope. I will hurry back and write a song.

531
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,260
What are you doing anyway?

532
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,760
The club's budget paper.

533
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,010
I am the president, aren't I?

534
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:05,560
Where is P'Tine?

535
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,060
Practicing guitar at the club.

536
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,040
He said he couldn't focus here.

537
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,820
It's so late already.

538
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,870
Is he still practicing?

539
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,220
Hey! You're home?

540
00:35:45,373 --> 00:35:47,780
I told you not to wait.

541
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,340
Who is waiting?

542
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:52,900
I am hungry. Just filling my stomach.

543
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,309
Hungry? Yeah.

544
00:35:54,309 --> 00:35:58,660
You must be starving. You drink two cups.

545
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:03,360
Thank you.

546
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,110
How was your practice?

547
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:08,960
I am exhausted.

548
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,660
Look at my fingers. They're all worn out.

549
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,900
Just like old times.

550
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,120
Let's do this.

551
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:22,810
I'll let you grab my boobs (milk) to relieve your tiredness.

552
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:25,460
How is that going to help?

553
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,930
I meant this condensed milk.

554
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:35,360
You're always with a dirty mind.

555
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:43,259
- I'm going to pour it.
- Go ahead.

556
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,653
Thank you.

557
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,969
- So good.
- Yeah.

558
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:16,139
You just grabbed my milk (boobs).

559
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,859
It's my turn to grab yours.

560
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,493
Nope!

561
00:37:20,493 --> 00:37:21,750
Grab this.

562
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,259
Well. It's mine. I want to grab your boobs.

563
00:37:23,259 --> 00:37:26,089
No! Don't play. I'm still tired.

564
00:37:26,089 --> 00:37:28,129
Let me give you a massage.

565
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:30,100
Come on.

566
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,940
I built your brother up from when he was this small.

567
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,360
- And now?
- He is this big!

568
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,900
Seriously?

569
00:37:43,173 --> 00:37:45,110
What are you talking to these assholes about?

570
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:47,759
We are assholes now.

571
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,940
Just you.

572
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,839
I came to return your guitar.

573
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,379
We're just having a little chat.

574
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,779
Your brother told me that

575
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:02,239
your wife demands you to turn clothes before washing them.

576
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,270
Do not believe him.

577
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:07,600
Be on your way already.

578
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,550
Come on. Go to class.

579
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,610
Go on.

580
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:15,089
Tell your friend to keep fighting.

581
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:18,909
Sure. If he succeeds, he will treat you guys to one big meal.

582
00:38:18,909 --> 00:38:21,369
We will wait for it.

583
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:25,179
Of course. See you later. Bye now.

584
00:38:25,179 --> 00:38:28,330
You didn't store your empty plate, dipshit.

585
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,680
Who is fighting who?

586
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,179
Your brother asked us for love advice for his friend.

587
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,550
His friend?

588
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:39,539
His friend loves this person but doesn't get loved back.

589
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:42,000
Same old stuff.

590
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,099
Not his friend. It's him.

591
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:47,440
He just borrowed my guitar to write a love song.

592
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,959
He must have a crush on someone.

593
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,569
Student from his faculty maybe.

594
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:55,150
Architecture people are hot!

595
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:57,260
Must be a senior from his faculty.

596
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:00,609
The other day at home, I heard him talking to someone on the phone.

597
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:02,190
When he saw me, he did this.

598
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:04,799
- He knocked on the table?
- He hung up.

599
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,540
I don't want him to get hurt. He is naïve.

600
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,609
Before you're worried about your little brother,

601
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:16,020
you should be worried about yourself.

602
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,633
Why?

603
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:22,020
Who is teaching Tine guitar?

604
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:25,130
He practices by himself.

605
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:28,310
My friend walked by the music club the other day.

606
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:30,990
He heard Tine talking so closely to someone.

607
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:33,840
They were practicing music together.

608
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,230
Not practicing by himself obviously.

609
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:39,760
Might be his friend. He has friends, you know?

610
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,459
That's good. We're just afraid it'd be someone else.

611
00:39:44,459 --> 00:39:49,759
Imagine a late night with just the two of them.

612
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,710
Damn! I don't want to picture.

613
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,859
- Can you teach me guitar?
- Sure thing.

614
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,820
It's his friend. You guys are overthinking.

615
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:18,619
What are you watching? Porn?

616
00:40:18,619 --> 00:40:21,160
I am not a perv like you.

617
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:27,820
I'm off for guitar practice.

618
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,529
Food is on the table.

619
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:32,380
Wash the dishes when you're done.

620
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,999
You can practice here.

621
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,150
I won't distract you.

622
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:38,049
I'm not afraid of that.

623
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:41,879
I just… don't want to bother you.

624
00:40:41,879 --> 00:40:43,980
I am off now.

625
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:49,679
Don't wait up. I'll be late. Just go to bed.

626
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:51,470
See you.

627
00:40:52,253 --> 00:40:54,133
See you.

628
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,950
Can't sleep?

629
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,129
You can't sleep?

630
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:14,229
Right. You make me eat only salad.

631
00:41:14,229 --> 00:41:16,130
I am so hungry.

632
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:18,790
Can I go get something to eat?

633
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:21,399
No. You'll get to eat in the morning.

634
00:41:21,399 --> 00:41:24,569
Come on. Just boiled eggs?

635
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:27,749
No. Get some sleep. I have a presentation tomorrow.

636
00:41:27,749 --> 00:41:30,040
Boiled eggs?

637
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,930
Sleep!

638
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,190
What are you doing?

639
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:06,259
I am hungry. I'm fixing myself something to eat.

640
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,550
Go ahead and condemn me.

641
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:12,070
What are you laughing at?

642
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,530
Nothing.

643
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:17,599
It's just amusing that you're falling off the wagon. It's cute.

644
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:18,620
You're not yelling at me?

645
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:22,619
Only if you share some. I won't yell at you.

646
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:24,553
Fine.

647
00:42:24,553 --> 00:42:25,699
Just wait for a bit.

648
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,633
Hurry.

649
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,800
Done!

650
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:43,950
What a cute dish.

651
00:42:43,959 --> 00:42:46,380
There's a mini heart here.

652
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:49,140
- Let's eat.
- Yep.

653
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:55,600
You started off first.

654
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,780
Hungry, huh?

655
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,433
Feed me?

656
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:03,840
I cooked for you.

657
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,060
And I have to feed you, too?

658
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,919
I know I'm a pro. Yummy, right?

659
00:43:12,919 --> 00:43:16,229
It's delicious. One more, please?

660
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,140
It's so good.

661
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,790
Enough!

662
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:21,930
Go cook it yourself if you want more.

663
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,039
You said you would share.

664
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,689
Can I have some?

665
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:27,719
But I am hungry.

666
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:31,760
Let's share. Okay?

667
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,890
Can I have some? No?

668
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:54,030
Hey!

669
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:55,460
What are you doing?

670
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,400
Nothing.

671
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,449
Here. I'm returning Tine his lecture notes.

672
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:11,339
He hasn't come back yet. He's still practicing.

673
00:44:11,339 --> 00:44:15,979
Yeah? I'll leave them with you then.

674
00:44:15,979 --> 00:44:18,060
Didn't you see him at all today?

675
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:20,689
I thought he was practicing guitar with you two.

676
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:22,150
Are you nuts?

677
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:25,900
Do we look like we can play guitar?

678
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:28,150
Then, who is he practicing with?

679
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,599
What are you watching? Porn?

680
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,630
Didn't you see him at all today?

681
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:47,140
I thought he was practicing guitar with you two.

682
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:51,749
Are you nuts? Do we look like we can play guitar?

683
00:44:51,749 --> 00:44:54,120
Then, who is he practicing with?

684
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,889
My friend walked by the music club the other day.

685
00:44:56,890 --> 00:44:59,319
He heard Tine talking so closely to someone.

686
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:02,049
They were practicing music together.

687
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:04,750
Not practicing by himself obviously.

688
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:12,929
C. Like this.

689
00:45:12,929 --> 00:45:16,400
- Slow down. I can't remember.
- This is G.

690
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,153
G.

691
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:27,040
What's this?

692
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,913
Like this.

693
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,730
Wrong! Start over!

694
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:37,292
Wrong. Press again.

695
00:45:37,292 --> 00:45:39,440
You show me.

696
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:43,843
Record it.

697
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,580
C Chord.

698
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:04,340
Imagine yourself as a protagonist in a movie.

699
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:07,319
You are a well-trained guitar player.

700
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:11,889
It's a scene where you're about to perform in front of many people.

701
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:13,339
They are screaming and cheering for you.

702
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:15,879
You are so great. It's the ending scene of the movie.

703
00:46:15,879 --> 00:46:18,520
A happy ending, you know?

Do you prefer acoustic or electric guitar?

718
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,630
Acoustic.

719
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:09,970
Because someone just bought me one.

720
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,270
Do you know any other musical instruments?

721
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:14,240
Bass, drums, electone, ukulele.

722
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,000
That's my boy.

723
00:48:16,001 --> 00:48:17,620
Is there anything you don't know?

724
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:20,620
I know nothing about being a club secretary.

725
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:28,329
Your fingers are ruined. You should've let me teach you.

726
00:48:28,329 --> 00:48:31,340
I wanted to do it myself.

727
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,833
Am I good?

728
00:48:33,833 --> 00:48:35,339
- No.
- Did I play it well?

729
00:48:35,339 --> 00:48:37,949
- No.
- Yes!!

730
00:48:37,949 --> 00:48:40,020
It should've been better if you'd let me teach.

731
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:43,790
But I pulled it off, didn't I?

732
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:45,430
People were clapping for me.

733
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:49,499
You did great! All right? Happy?

734
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,830
Will you marry me?

735
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:11,009
Having me as a secretary is not enough?

736
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:13,310
I want to have you as my wife.

737
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:20,780
Many people have warned me not to work with someone I love.

738
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:23,900
Because duties might put us in difficult situations.

739
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,260
But I want to try.

740
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:31,180
We might fight, but it can help us understand each other more.

741
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:32,740
More importantly,

742
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:38,160
no one can stand the outrage of this club president like I can.

Millions of people are out there. Why are you hitting on Boss's sweetheart?

748
00:50:15,919 --> 00:50:16,809
You like P'Mil?

749
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:18,159
Take back all the speakers.

750

Tine, can you talk to your friends?

Fire!

A love guru once said…

Never let work conflicts ruin your love life.

754
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:29,140
Will you play Scrubb's songs for me or scrub my back?

755
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:30,305
Take your pick.

P'Jennie.The legendary electric guitarist.

She's from Hot Wave contest the same year as P'Toon Bodyslam.

♫ You came into my life and caused chaos ♫
