Do you want me to grab your boobs or kiss you till you drop?

00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,910
Kiss me till I drop?

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,740
I hear that countless times.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,169
And I haven't dropped yet.

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,504
Right.

6
00:00:14,504 --> 00:00:17,680
Since you ask for it.

7
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:21,860
You wanna drop, yeah?

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,750
Wat, I'm here to pick you up.

9
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,643
I'm going now.

10
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,500
Just call me when you have time.

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,700
Even if I don't have time, I will.

12
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,420
Get the door for me.

13
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,320
I see that I'm very welcomed here.

14
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,399
I am out now.

15
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,133
See you.

16
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,260
Want some help with that?

17
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,779
Take care of him for me, P'Dim.

18
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,129
Don't worry.

19
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,399
I will do my best.

20
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,626
I'm sure I'm in the wrong hands.

21
00:01:13,627 --> 00:01:15,999
What did you just say, Wat?

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,450
I can take care of you just fine.

23
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,240
Hey! Stop with that sad-ass face.

24
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,373
What's wrong?

25
00:01:26,373 --> 00:01:28,780
Who would have thought

26
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:32,733
that my first relationship has become a long-distance one?

27
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,369
Sathorn and Ladprao? This is your long distance?

28
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,780
Hello!

29
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,693
Ladprao is not Las Vegas.

30
00:01:41,693 --> 00:01:43,649
But I miss him.

31
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,979
We see each other every day.

32
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,930
He's not in the mood.

33
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,340
Is this really your house, P'Dim?

34
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,339
Make yourselves at home.

35
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,740
Pay respect to my house spirits, too.

36
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,839
Guys!

37
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,590
This is the front yard Green told us about.

38
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,972
Right here.

39
00:02:10,972 --> 00:02:12,079
They did it outdoor.

40
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,779
What? Right here what?

41
00:02:13,779 --> 00:02:16,280
Nothing. We're talking about dogs.

42
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,129
Nothing.

43
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,492
Let's get inside, you assholes.

44
00:02:20,493 --> 00:02:21,891
I don't have dogs, by the way.

45
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:23,759
In front of the spirit house?

46
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,425
Yuck! Stop already!

47
00:02:25,426 --> 00:02:26,639
Did they really do it here?

48
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,940
The gate is always closed, too.

49
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,440
They weren't ashamed at all.

50
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,399
I've set up this room for you to practice for fun.

51
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,746
For fun?

52
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,300
Why didn't you bring us here in the first place?

53
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,179
These instruments are not mine.

54
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,219
I borrowed them all.

55
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,693
This electric guitar belongs to P'Jennie.

56
00:02:51,694 --> 00:02:54,339
Damn! The legendary guitar.

57
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,099
Let's take a selfie, guys.

58
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,493
Cool stuff.

59
00:02:58,493 --> 00:02:59,491
Let's capture the memory.

60
00:02:59,492 --> 00:03:01,125
Come here.

61
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,329
Wat, come here. It's your last chance.

62
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,299
We're done taking a selfie.

63
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,339
What now?

64
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,060
I'm going to keep it.

65
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,212
Good musicians must focus on their music.

66
00:03:15,213 --> 00:03:16,659
If I don't do this,

67
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,890
you guys will chat with your partners all day.

68
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,199
I will take care of your phones for you.

69
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:23,319
Give it. Don't argue!

70
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,219
What if my mom calls?

71
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:26,319
I'll answer for you.

72
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,850
Wat, come on.

73
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,199
Don't be reluctant.

74
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,710
Quickly. Now!

75
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,513
People are waiting.

76
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:40,329
I am an exception. Because I am single.

77
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:42,129
But you're on TikTok every day.

78

I'm following you, Miss TikTok star.

79
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,353
Give it to me.

80
00:03:46,353 --> 00:03:48,110
Seriously?

81
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,779
- Hurry up!
- Fine.

82
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,419
When will we get them back?

83
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,220
After practice.

84
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,190
You mean today?

85
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,260
No.

86
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,880
After this schedule is completed.

87
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,866

88
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,590
This is your practice schedule.

89
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,004
Do we even have breaks?

90
00:04:08,004 --> 00:04:10,713
Are we allowed to eat?

91
00:04:10,713 --> 00:04:13,529
We don't have any day off. Isn't it too tough?

92
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,480
Will we be able to do it?

93
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,850
If you guys can't do it, then quit.

94

- Yes.

Temp, why are you not eating?

183
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,639
I've felt full since last night.

Yeah?

185
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,983

No.

- Are you really sick?
- Nice acting.

- Temp, can you walk?
- I can.

- To see Tine.
- You can't.

00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:40,999
P'Type, my jersey is the point here.

338
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,019
I'm having a meeting soon.

339
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,199
Let me make this clear, don't get near Jib.

340
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,479
P'…

341
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,940
What's with him?

342
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:52,825
I showed him my jersey. Why did he keep asking who Jib was?

343
00:20:52,826 --> 00:20:55,180
What's that? Khao Oho.

344
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:58,399
- Cool?
- What a subpar. Mine is better.

345
00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:00,929
Did you print "Dr. Pear?"

346
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:03,253
That'd be too simple.

347
00:21:03,253 --> 00:21:07,360
I'll let you guess. Three syllables.

348
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,033
- My Dear Doc?
- What?? That's too plain.

349
00:21:12,033 --> 00:21:14,220
I printed "Cute Doctor".

350
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,649
That's nice.

351
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,065
Just wait and see. I'm coming, bro!

352
00:21:19,065 --> 00:21:23,479
Great! You'll blow her mind today.

353
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:24,910
A bit tight.

354
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:29,399
Guys, your food is here. Let's eat first.

355
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,393
Take one.

356
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,079
Don't eat too much or you might get side stitches.

357
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,913
We have to be on the field around 12:45.

358
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,809
Okay, P'Mil. I will be there.

359
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,029
Phukong, aren't you going to eat?

360
00:21:55,029 --> 00:21:57,620
I'm not really hungry.

361
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,580
P'Tine, if we're all set now,

362
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:04,650
can I stop by the music club for a bit?

363
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,010
Are you going to see Wat?

364
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:11,439
Right. I'm going to see my big brother.

365
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:13,613
Who else would it be?

366
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,270
I want to go with you

367
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:20,320
but I need one last rehearsal with people on the bleachers.

368
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,846
You wait here.

369
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,940
Can you take this to Wat for me?

370
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,449
What is it? Can I see?

371
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,620
Hey!

372
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,732
For Wat, not you.

373
00:22:35,733 --> 00:22:37,390
Can't I just take a peek?

374
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:38,306
No. It's for Wat.

375
00:22:38,307 --> 00:22:41,452
You're too possessive. I'm his brother here.

376
00:22:41,453 --> 00:22:42,612
Take it to him.

377
00:22:42,613 --> 00:22:44,009
Okay. See you later.

378
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:44,939
See you.

379
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,365
- Thanks.
- Sure.

380
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:49,299
P'Dim, can I see Boom?

381
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,030
Anything urgent?

382
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:54,399
If you want to give him anything, leave it with me.

383
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,100
I'll give it to him.

384
00:22:57,446 --> 00:22:58,731
I just want to meet my boyfriend.

385
00:22:58,732 --> 00:23:00,519
Why are you such a love blocker?

386
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,759
You can't eat.

387
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,647
You're being a jerk just because you had a fight with your wife.

388
00:23:03,647 --> 00:23:04,619
Nice mouth!

389
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,831
I'm going to eat them all.

390
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,780
P'Dim.

391
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,990
Is P'Mil here?

392
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:12,459
Why? You're his boyfriend or what?

393
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:13,505
No.

394
00:23:13,506 --> 00:23:15,706
Someone wanted me to give this to him.

395
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:19,453
I was just teasing.

396
00:23:19,453 --> 00:23:21,839
You two will never be a thing.

397
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,830
I'll call him for you.

398
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,339
- Mil!
- What?

399
00:23:25,339 --> 00:23:26,790
Sarawat's little brother is here for you.

400
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,220
Phukong?

401
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:36,043
What?

402
00:23:36,043 --> 00:23:38,579
I don't know. He is here to see you.

403
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,980
I'm going to have lunch.

404
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,070
It's your watch now.

405
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:45,509
If the members' lovers are here, drive them out. Just like I did.

406
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:47,430
Sure.

407
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,479
My eyes are like scanners.

408
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,010
I can tell which one is the boyfriend or girlfriend.

409
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:53,729
You're clever.

410
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:55,263
Thanks.

411
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,346
Have a seat.

412
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,839
This is for P'Wat from P'Tine.

413
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,690
Can you give it to him?

414
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,773
And mine?

415
00:24:10,773 --> 00:24:12,390
That's all I'm here for.

416
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,823
Yeah?

417
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,520
But I can smell crispy pork with kale.

418
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,050
Perfect sniffer like a dog.

419
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,100
- Are you picking at me?
- No.

420
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,573
Here it is.

421
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,466
I got it right.

422
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,403
Thanks.

423
00:24:36,403 --> 00:24:38,266
That's it?

424
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:41,290
All I got is 'thanks?'

425
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,919
I told you many times.

426
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,119
This is the brother zone.

427
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,012
Why don't you remember?

428
00:24:51,013 --> 00:24:53,213
I'm going to kick your ass.

429
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,793
Come on.

430
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,513
Happy?

431
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,140
You're not wearing heavy makeup today.

432
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,409
You look good.

433
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:09,610
If I did, someone would need to clean it for me.

434
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:21,419
- There's something in your hair.
- Right.

435
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:23,820
- Right there.
- I got it for you.

436
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,100
You can go now.

437
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,833
See you later.

438
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,381
- See you later.
- Bye.

439
00:25:31,381 --> 00:25:34,019
- Bye, P'Dim.
- Bye.

440
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,439
What's up?

441
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,769
Brothers pat each other's head now?

442
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:45,020
There was something in his hair. I helped him get it out.

443
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,289
- We're brothers.
- Yeah, yeah. Brothers.

444
00:25:47,289 --> 00:25:49,040
I can pat your head, too.

445
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,293
Brothers…

446
00:25:53,293 --> 00:25:54,450
Mil!!

447
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,346
I am so sorry.

448
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,503
Wat.

449
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,306
It's from Tine.

450
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,283
Thank you.

451
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,039
Why did you agree to be our guitarist?

452
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,929
If this was last year, I wouldn't do it.

453
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:30,480
But everything has changed now.

454
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:52,353
A good drink will make you fresh and give you the energy to perform on stage.

455
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:05,660
Wat, I'm so busy that I can't bring this to you myself.

456
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,719
I cooked this because you said you didn't get to eat it anymore.

457
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,250
This chicken green curry from Chef Tine is full of love.

458
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,739
When the cheerleading contest is over,

459
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,890
this chef will be there supporting you.

460
00:27:39,026 --> 00:27:41,200
Your food looks kind of different.

461
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:47,590
A new menu… from a restaurant… around here.

462
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,119
Just what I thought.

463
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,640
It's their marketing, right?

464
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,190
It looks delicious.

465
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,800
When you guys do the soundcheck,

466
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,373
do it slowly. Do not rush it. Okay?

467
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:11,226
I will be there next to you. Okay?

468
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:22,879
We have time.

469
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,649
I will stand next to the stage, helping you with the soundcheck.

470
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:28,559
You must look at me.

471
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,279
I'll tell you to volume up or down.

472
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,213
Understand?

473
00:28:32,213 --> 00:28:34,526
Wat, did you understand me?

474
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:44,066
Keep fighting.

475
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,206
Keep fighting!

476
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,853
You too!

477
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,053
Wat.

478
00:29:38,393 --> 00:29:40,426
Thank you.

479
00:29:40,426 --> 00:29:42,419
Wat! Come on.

480
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:44,060
We're running out of time.

481
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,439
Tineee!

482
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,600
Let's go.

483
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,129
Wat!!

484
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,963
Come on.

485
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,290
[Traditional Soccer Match: 2U]

486
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,289
Hello.

487
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:17,579
Welcome you all to the 2U.

488
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:21,089
The 17th Traditional Soccer and Music Day.

489
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:23,709
Apart from the fun soccer match to watch,

490
00:30:23,709 --> 00:30:25,150
there's another highlight.

491
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:28,889
- Which is?
- The cheerleading competition. Just wow!

492
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:31,519
They are gorgeous.

493
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,345
I saw the cheerleaders in the purple costumes. They're just great.

494
00:30:34,346 --> 00:30:36,890
- What is great?
- The cheerleaders.

495
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,189
They are beautiful.

496
00:30:38,189 --> 00:30:40,790
I think just the same.

497
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,390
Be serious.

498
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:47,490
We're about to play now.

499
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:51,190
Hey!! Boss!

500
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,612
That's Pear.

501
00:30:52,613 --> 00:30:54,466
Your Dr. Pear.

502
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,411
- Your beloved doctor.
- No.

503
00:30:58,411 --> 00:31:00,213

669
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,390
Jib again?

670
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:12,220
She is a staff taking care of the soccer team.

671
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,920
Pay your attention to me.

672
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,870
I just won the big game.

673
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:18,759
Yeah. I was just playing.

674
00:42:18,759 --> 00:42:21,190
What reward do you want most?

675
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:23,060
I don't want any reward.

676
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:26,573
I just want you to see the goal medal yourself.

677
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,980
You came last minute, Tine.

678
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:39,040
I ran as fast as I could.

679
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,510
Fong, thanks for your support today.

680
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:44,500
You too, Ohm.Thank you.

681
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,599
See you. Bye.

682
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,330
Bye.

683
00:42:47,933 --> 00:42:50,350
What are we going to eat?

684
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:52,059
She just thanked me.

685
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:54,359
- But she touched my arm.
- She looked into my eyes.

686
00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:56,499
But she grabbed my shoulder. She likes me.

687
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,733
Are you sure?

688
00:42:58,733 --> 00:43:00,700
What the heck?

689
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,379
She likes me. You can ask Tine.

690
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:03,913
Right…?

691
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,773
She likes me.

692
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:14,849
Are you free this Saturday?

693
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:16,700
Are you tricking me to build a model again?

694
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:19,749
- I'm asking you to see a movie with me.
- Seriously?

695
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:22,520
My turn to play hard to get.

696
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,500
So this is how you're going to be?

697
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,739
What a perfect day!

698
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:29,790
- Our cheerleading team and the band won.
- Bye, everyone.

699
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:32,213
See you.

700
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,880
Where should we celebrate?

701
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:46,930
The band will go celebrate at Jae Tun's tonight.

702
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:49,553
If you guys don't have plans,

703
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:53,444
- you can come and join us.
- Are you just saying or actually inviting?

704
00:43:53,444 --> 00:43:55,480
I can go but…

705
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:59,093
I will make the call about that thing.

706
00:43:59,093 --> 00:44:02,089
Again? That thing again?

707
00:44:02,089 --> 00:44:03,660
No way!

708
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:05,959
No? Bye then!! Come on, guys.

709
00:44:05,959 --> 00:44:10,326
Let's go party!

710
00:44:10,326 --> 00:44:12,093
Bye.

711
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:51,200
Why did you tag me when you just posted a picture of yourself?

712
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,980
Who told you it's just me?

713
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:55,193
It's a picture of us.

714
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:59,840
Picture of us?

715
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:04,779
I somehow got the familiar vibe being here.

716
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:08,260
So I looked it up in my gallery.

717
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:12,980
I didn't think I would find a familiar face in my picture.

718
00:45:17,766 --> 00:45:19,599
Is that me?

719
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:22,683
Me?

720
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:27,746
That means…

721
00:45:27,746 --> 00:45:32,226
the guy I saw at that concert was you?

722
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:42,730
Thank you for searching for me.

723
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:48,633
Thank you for coming back to me.

724
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,750
So this is our first couple photo, actually.

725
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,473
You looked so hot that day.

726
00:46:03,473 --> 00:46:05,080
I look a lot hotter now.

727
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,100
I said it because I only saw your back.

728
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,660
What a shame.

729
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:20,900
The other band performs the last act tonight.

730
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,920
If today was that day,

731
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,973
we'd get to hear Scrubb songs again.

732
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:31,550
You can hear it tonight.

733
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:38,873
Again?

734
00:46:38,873 --> 00:46:40,820
Same old. Same old.

735
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:42,506
Old but classic.

736
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:46,460
Your ear, please.

737
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:52,063
Thank you.

738
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:07,893
I think I get it.

739
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:11,400
Get what?

740
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,133
Want to know?

741
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:16,093
Get closer.

742
00:47:16,093 --> 00:47:17,980
Get your ear closer.

743
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:24,100
Damn you!!

744
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:26,489
So many people here.

745
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:28,600
What people? Where?

746
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,139
A lot inside.

747
00:47:30,139 --> 00:47:32,679
I'll show them. Did they see that?

748
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:34,546
They didn't.

749
00:47:34,546 --> 00:47:37,300
You're an ass.

750
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,640
Are you blushing?

751
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,180
No.

752
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,686
I get it.

753
00:47:46,686 --> 00:47:49,680
I get how good it is to have you by my side.

754
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:00,000
Two years ago, we bumped into each other.

755
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,130
Last year, we waved our hands in a concert together.

756
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:08,900
This year, we stand next to one another.

757
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:18,726
The years to come, it can be anywhere as long as we're together.

758
00:48:18,726 --> 00:48:25,470
♫ I just want to ask you ♫

[Next Week]
Welcome everyone to the music club's volunteer camp.

761
00:48:51,453 --> 00:48:54,719
My friend wants to surprise his boyfriend for their anniversary.

762
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,993
Do you think we don't know it's you?

763
00:48:56,993 --> 00:49:00,933
How about you go check if he remembers at all?

764
00:49:00,933 --> 00:49:04,006
The winner gets the room with air-con.

765
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,245
When did you become my little brother's boyfriend?

766
00:49:10,245 --> 00:49:12,140
You should ask your brother.

767
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:31,310
♫ I don't know why I don't look at you like I used to ♫

768
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:36,420
♫ I don't look at you like the first time we met. I liked you then ♫

769
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:43,410
♫ I just don't know when it became love ♫

770
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:52,380
♫ Music that I used to listen to, today, I hear them like never before ♫

771
00:49:52,380 --> 00:50:00,720
♫ No matter how many songs I play, they sound similar now ♫

772
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:05,220
♫ Like every song was written for you ♫

773
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,980
♫ You came into my life and caused chaos ♫

774
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:10,560
♫ But without you, I miss that chaos ♫

775
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:13,400
♫ You're the only one who can make me cry ♫

776
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:16,010
♫ And you're the only one who can make me smile ♫

777
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:18,690
♫ Because I can't be alone anymore ♫

778
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:21,820
♫ I can't be without you ♫

779
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:26,020
♫ Forever I want you by my side. How long will it take to be with you? ♫

780
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:32,020
♫ I can't recall what it was like without you by my side ♫

781
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:37,390
♫ I have completely forgotten how it was like to live each day ♫

782
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:43,080
♫ I've been with you for too long,
I don't know what I'd do if you were to disappear ♫

783
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:49,940
♫ I want to know how long we'll be together? ♫

784
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:56,520
♫ Still together ♫
