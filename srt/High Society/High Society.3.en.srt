1
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,380
In the next life,

2
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:40,340
let's be born as the Chaebol's youngest daughters.

3
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,680
Come here.

4
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,190
Daebak.

5
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,340
Why haven't you left yet?

6
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,060
I need to see the ending before I leave. Why did you come here?

7
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:18,740
I want to ask you the same. Why did you come?

8
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,910
Your love affairs have been impressive.

9
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,730
You only look for one thing: a pretty face. Ji Yi is pretty.

10
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:29,300
Girls are funny. Even when they're not pretty, when they meet each other, they comment that they've become pretty.

11
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,680
She asked me to take her home.

12
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,230
Yeah right.

13
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:35,580
I know her. She's not someone who would ask that.

14
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,460
She's not someone who puts a straw on a man to upgrade her life.

15
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,290
If you try to mess with her, I will kill you.

16
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,250
Did I say anything?

17
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,780
Why do you pick on someone for something that didn't even happen yet? Do you know what I went through because of her?

18
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:01,130
Why do you keep coming to this neighborhood? You're not even going to live here.

19
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:04,190
She doesn't know anything about you.

20
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,370
Don't you think she'll get hurt when she finds out later?

21
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:10,040
You know something like that, too? Feelings?

22
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,240
What kind of person do you think I am?

23
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,900
Next time, call me oppa. I know all of your siblings.

24
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,070
Then you must know how I am at home.

25
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:21,720
I found out not too long ago. That you're a pain in the neck.

26
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,550
But what does having a part-time job change?

27
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:29,100
It lets me endure my life at home. Even if I leave the house, hell is still waiting for me.

28
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,400
So,

29
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,170
you see other people's hardships and think, "Oh, I am better off than them. I have to endure."

30
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,100
Is that how you feel?
- I don't think I'm better than them.

31
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,440
I don't want to live in a different hell when I'm already living in hell.

32
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,810
Just marry someone. Then you can leave your house. That's killing two birds with one stone.

33
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,420
I want to marry someone I love.

34
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,910
I yearn for a warm, simple life.

35
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,450
I want someone who loves me for who I am.

36
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,970
Not because I'm a daughter of a wealthy family.

37
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,160
Wow, your standards are weird.

38
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,580
Why would you hide that you're a daughter of a wealthy family? That's your best qualification.

39
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,820
Let's stop now. We've been talking for way too long.

40
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,150
We should go. I'm going to sleep in tomorrow.

41
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,490
I was fired from my part-time job. I'm in a bad mood.

42
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:16,710
I'm in a bad mood because I was fired. And Deputy Choi is a jerk.

43
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:20,430
Don't talk bad about Joon Ki. He's my friend.

44
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:25,150
Why can't I talk bad about him when I got fired? That bastard.

45
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,350
High Society
Episode 3

46
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,390
Did you personally order the creation of the subsidiary's secret funds?

47
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,450
No.

48
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:43,170
What do you think of the fact that the global group Taejin is quickly becoming known for being hotbed for crime?

49
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:48,500
Please, make one more statement.
- Wait
- Just one moment!

50
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,480
He's really going to throw me away. How could he decide to go to the prosecution investigation without me?

51
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,170
It's Vice President Chang's work.

52
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:01,720
It seems like he's trying to sway the company towards himself.

53
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:13,260
You know that we have to be careful right now, right?

54
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,450
Yes. I saw the news.

55
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:19,510
Can't you get involved in our affairs in times like these?

56
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,680
From now on, your marriage will be thoroughly proceeded in political terms.

57
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,080
That's how I married, too.

58
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,040
Do you want me to live like you do?

59
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,220
Life after you marry is all the same. Whether you love or not.

60
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,970
I'll marry someone I love, and I'll see whether it's the same life or not.

61
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,990
Stop being so difficult. Do what I tell you to do.

62
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,050
Do you think your parents would tell you to do something that harms you?

63
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,440
Hello?

64
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,990
It's Choi Joon Ki.

65
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:59,270
Chae Joong Ki? A scale?
(Chae joong ki means a scale in Korean.)

66
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,050
No, I'm Choi Joon Ki.

67
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,970
Can I now go upstairs?

68
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,570
Is this a bad time to call?

69
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,450
No, I'm fine now.

70
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,230
Come to the company.

71
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:26,930
I knew this would happen. You regretted firing me and you're asking me to come back, right?

72
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:30,910
No. You're optimistic about the trouble you caused.

73
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,830
Why did you tell me to come if you weren't going to accept me again?

74
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,440
I came because I have a good personality.

75
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,960
You must have a good support.
- Excuse me?

76
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,700
The terrible customer is waiting to apologize to you.

77
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,510
It seems as if she's going to die if she doesn't apologize.

78
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,300
I want to leave.
- What are you doing?

79
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,640
I'm not even a part-timer anymore anyway.

80
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,730
If I don't accept her apology, you'll go through a hard time.

81
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,070
I want to see that happen.

82
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:59,880
You understand what's going on, but I know what type of person you are.

83
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,010
Responsibility. You lack it.

84
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,990
Because of what you did, someone is about to get harmed.

85
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,690
But it has nothing to do with you?

86
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,780
♫ Sunday morning, rain is falling. ♫

87
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,900
I'm sorry about that time.

88
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,820
It was because I wasn't in a good mood.

89
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,940
You're going to accept my apology, right?

90
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,160
Don't act like that again.

91
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,810
Okay. I don't know whose support you have,

92
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:32,690
but please speak well of us. My husband's company...

93
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:37,120
is about to go bankrupt.

94
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,100
I understand, so you may leave.

95
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,680
When I come next time, let's meet again. I'll do better next time.

96
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,270
I got fired.

97
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,070
You didn't hear?

98
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:53,650
I told them to accept you again. Did I do well?

99
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,530
Yes, Yoon Ha?

100
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,760
Why do you do useless things, Oppa? I told you not to do it.

101
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,920
If you say you want it and then make two requests, it means you want me to act.

102
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,450
I'm sorry for bothering you.

103
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,600
Thank you for distracting me for a little bit.

104
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,600
Letting you continue your part-time job isn't only for your sake.

105
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,670
It's because I think it's going to help us when I use you later.

106
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,350
They're not telling me to come to work again.

107
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:22,320
I think it's too voracious of me to say it first.

108
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:27,510
If you can't get your job again, I'm going to question your sincerity.

109
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,590
I need your storage separation method manual

110
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,940
and the event with the best marketing effect.

111
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,650
Yeah, could you please organize it and send me an email?

112
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,520
Alright, thanks.

113
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,820
Today's get-together, include all of the part-timers, too.

114
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,620
Even the part-timers?

115
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,430
Part-timers are the ones who engage with the customers.

116
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:52,740
They may not feel any sense of belonging, so this is the only way we can make them loyal to us.
-Okay.

117
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,000
Oh, and also.

118
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,930
Get Chef Jung Chang Wook's, Chef Raymon Kim's and Chef Choi Hyun Suk's phone numbers and give them to me.

119
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,140
Okay.

120
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:08,120
This is Deputy Choi Joon Ki from Yoo Min Department Store.

121
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,910
I would like to talk to Chef Ishikawa Hideki myself.

122
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:15,520
Yes. It's because of a collaboration.

123
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,260
Yes. Thank you.

124
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,680
Let's have a meeting.

125
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,790
What is it?

126
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,150
I have something to tell you.

127
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,870
Phone numbers?

128
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,340
Excuse me-
- Go ahead.

129
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,340
Can we go somewhere else?

130
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:41,560
Let's go outside. I have to leave anyway.

131
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,860
Why aren't you saying anything?
- What do you mean?

132
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,770
I heard that she asked for me to be restored to my former position.
- So?

133
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,860
When should I start coming to work?
- Don't come.

134
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,500
Why?
- Because you're someone who would cause trouble again.

135
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,670
Problems that were fixed aren't problems.

136
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,090
This job doesn't seem desperate to you.

137
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:08,360
So, it's right to give your position to someone who's desperate.

138
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,510
- I don't think that's right.
- What isn't?

139
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:14,710
The source of the problem apologized. And if she wanted me to be restored to my position, you have do as she says.

140
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:17,230
Why do you think the source of the problem apologized?

141
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,490
It's doubtful. Humans

142
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:22,750
don't change that easily.

143
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,150
Why are you looking at me like that?

144
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm thinking whether you gave the source of the problem a pill or not.

145
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,280
Are you going to give me a pill, too?

146
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:43,880
What would a son of a wealthy family know? Have you ever experienced failure?

147
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,470
How can I express my desperation? Should I hold onto you and beg?

148
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,940
I don't know why I want to say this.

149
00:09:54,940 --> 00:10:00,620
It's a personal story. I don't tell my personal stories to people I'm not close with.

150
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,380
What do you do?

151
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:10,480
What is this? I said, what is your job?

152
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,020
I'm sorry.

153
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,850
Is it all if you're sorry?

154
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:16,530
I said, is it all if you're sorry?

155
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,250
How am I supposed to eat this?

156
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,070
If a parcel service came, you should've told me that there was a delivery for me.

157
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,870
Ah, yes.

158
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,780
Don't do that to my dad!

159
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,950
Who the heck are you?

160
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,200
I'm sorry.

161
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,330
What did my father do wrong?

162
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,710
You should have picked up your own package.

163
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:36,790
Stop it! The adults are talking.

164
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:41,140
Seriously. Some type of dirtbag you are.

165
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,520
Stop it... to my dad!

166
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,440
This kid!

167
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,790
Ah, it's my wrongdoing. What misdeed does this child have?

168
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,550
I'm... sorry.

169
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:55,250
You're going to die wiping other people's bottom like your dad.

170
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,650
Just eat this and disappear!

171
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:07,610
I'm going to go in after cleaning this. So, just go inside the security office.

172
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,090
Why did you stay still after getting hit?

173
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:18,380
Why can't you hit him? Just quit this kind of job!

174
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,580
I'm sorry.

175
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,280
What are you sorry about?

176
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,890
For making you tell a story that was hard for you to talk about.

177
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:44,790
Miss Jang Yoon Ha, do you think this story is something to be ashamed about?

178
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:48,790
That's why you can't advance while coming from a bad environment.

179
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,360
Are you ashamed of your poor background?

180
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:58,330
The person who made me like this is my father. My mother is a maid.

181
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:01,230
Laughter never left my household.

182
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,670
The thing that I want to tell you

183
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:07,140
through the story of a man that went through that kind of insult to keep that job

184
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:10,770
is how much of a privilege it is to work.

185
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:14,530
That's what work is to me.

186
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:17,180
What is it to you?

187
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:29,640
I don't know why I'm saying these things to you.

188
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,450
I'll see you later.

189
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,460
Then, can I start working again?

190
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,250
We have a company get-together dinner. Please attend.

191
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,900
Come inside. Let's have a match.

192
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,960
I don't have extra clothes, so come out.

193
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,390
Really?

194
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,960
♫ This is what you meant. 'Cause after all. ♫

195
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,100
♫ The city never sleeps tonight. It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit  ♫

196
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:28,300
♫ bigger, but then I'll admit. I'm just the same as I was.  ♫

197
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:35,730
♫ Now don't you understand
that I'm never changing who I am  ♫

198
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,390
Wear this.

199
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,320
- I was called by my brother.
- I have to go, too.

200
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,470
He should be satisfied after talking with me. Why is he calling you?

201
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:49,710
He personally checks my performance everyday.

202
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:52,060
He told me to be careful of you.

203
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,910
We need an event. After remodeling, I am working to prepare for a reopening.

204
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:59,730
Because he doesn't have a person of his own. Who would like that kind of temper?

205
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:04,230
There's no one to risk their life and fight for him. He's envious of me. That's why he's trying to separate us.

206
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,860
We aren't ones to be separated.

207
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:12,510
I know... He's probably going to tell you to come to him. He did that last time while I was watching.

208
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,210
He told you to come to his side.

209
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:17,060
When I think about that time... even now, my blood gushes backwards.

210
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,070
Someone will probably think that we're dating if they saw us.

211
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:24,810
Even though you can breakup after dating a girl, there's no reason for friends to be separated. You are more precious to me than a girl.

212
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,660
You... How come you never say that you like me?

213
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,220
This guy acting like a girl...

214
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:34,560
You need to say words of affection. Repeat after me.

215
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,730
"I like you."

216
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,950
"I hella like you."

217
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,720
You crazy person!

218
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,040
Ah, you should at least say it to me once!

219
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,210
Ah... Ah, I'm going to die.

220
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:54,180
Aigoo, aigoo! So why did you drink past your limit?

221
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,700
Ah, my head is aching.

222
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,620
Eat!

223
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:03,570
The director jerk didn't make a fuss last night?

224
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,020
Oh, it looks good!

225
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,510
You say that you don't want to eat and then you always steal from other people.

226
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:12,030
It's more delicious if you steal from others.

227
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,500
He probably won't ask me to pay for his ripped clothes, right?

228
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,940
- You remember that?
- Just up to that point.

229
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,390
That's the reason why my film got cut off. It's awful to think back on that event.

230
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:25,020
Aigoo, how expensive it must it be? It would probably be a few months' wages.

231
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:30,680
You know when someone tells their story to a person for the first time...

232
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,400
Yes.

233
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,830
If someone says "I'm saying this to someone for the first time."

234
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,400
They told a story that they never told anyone.

235
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,700
If he's a guy, it's 100% a ploy to get you.

236
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,470
A ploy?

237
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:46,220
Did you think that they were innocently saying that because they like you?

238
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,890
It might be different if Deputy Choi said that.

239
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:54,290
Ah, really? He said that.

240
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,850
What? He talked about himself.

241
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:00,390
He's not the son of a rich household. He grew up in a poor family.

242
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,090
Then, why is his personality so great?

243
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,490
You have a prejudice about the rich.

244
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:10,070
That's true. Seeing the director jerk, just because you're a chaebol doesn't mean you're innocent and don't know how the world is.

245
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:14,680
He thought I would like him so he was super cautious. He's watched too many dramas.

246
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,120
If they're a chaebol, they think that one would sell their soul to like them.

247
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,060
Now you're talking.

248
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,850
I see Deputy Choi in a different light now.

249
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:28,170
Has he become someone I can look up to?

250
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,290
Yup.

251
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:34,490
Wow, so exciting! To celebrate, I should visit the office.

252
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:04,010
Miss Lee Ji Yi!

253
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,350
You've heard of noblesse oblige, right?

254
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,130
I've heard of it.

255
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:18,730
We're calling it even with what you said for the ripped dress shirt, right? Thank you.

256
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,800
This person is funny.

257
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:25,390
I understand. While paying it back, I will starve...

258
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:29,660
I can get kicked out to semi-basement because I can't pay the rent.

259
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,570
You are quite funny.

260
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:34,940
Then me being funny evens it out for the dress shirt, right?

261
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,920
Is your head only filled with thoughts of money?

262
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,490
Yes.

263
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:46,500
Ah, am I losing it? Or am I just meeting strange people?

264
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,280
How can you look at me and only think of money?

265
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,870
What?

266
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,990
Of course, I'm not saying that it's a definite that you should fall in love with me,

267
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,360
but you are extreme.

268
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,960
What is he saying?
- Forget about the shirt.

269
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,110
I'm saying that it's noblesse oblige.

270
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,070
Thank you!

271
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,510
Are you just leaving?

272
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:10,660
And if I don't just leave?
- This person...

273
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:15,620
You don't have any manners? If someone shows kindness, you should also show kindness.

274
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,890
Your relationship with people can't be one-sided.

275
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,820
I understand. Follow me.

276
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,830
In any case, the rich are more stingy with their money. That's how they are able to collect more money.

277
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:31,480
Lee Ji Yi, you must do better. From now on, let's bring packed food for lunch.

278
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,200
Ah, what is she saying?

279
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,890
Talking about ghosts chewing and eating rice seeds.
(Korean proverb to say they're saying nonsense)

280
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,960
Joon Ki.

281
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,410
Yes.

282
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:46,800
You know our nation's soccer when Hiddink was around, right?

283
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,000
Your life can change based on which leader you meet.

284
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,480
I thought that you were smart. You have been with Chang Soo for too long.

285
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,760
This is it? You said you understood.

286
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,610
Your $1,000 is the same as my $10.

287
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,170
Our relationship works out so well.

288
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:21,260
I don't like coffee if it's not from coffee beans.

289
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:25,320
Should I drink it then? It's a waste.

290
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:28,420
Drink it.

291
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,830
You are quite strange.

292
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,810
What is?

293
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:39,450
You're uncultivated, poor, and dumb.

294
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,620
But strangely... I want to be with you.

295
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:46,400
Who's uncultivated, poor, and dumb?

296
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,060
You.

297
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,690
If you have something to say, then say it.

298
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:55,960
I'm not in the position to say anything I want.

299
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,110
Even though you can say anything you want.

300
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,480
That's why I'm telling you to say it.

301
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,050
You might get upset.

302
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,300
What exactly do you think of me?

303
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:09,070
Director from hell, hella player, hella rude, hella selfish, hella delusional, hella awkward!

304
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,650
Hey!

305
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,940
You also make me think of a seaweed.

306
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,920
What kind of seaweed?

307
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,860
Good-looking?
(Play on words: seaweed is 'gim' in Korean and good-looking is 'jalsenggim'. She's saying he's a hansome seaweed)

308
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:24,020
You're not going to give me a disadvantage after you told me to tell you honestly, right?

309
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,400
Then, I'll be leaving.
- Let's meet sometimes.

310
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,100
Why?
- Because it's fun.

311
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:34,950
When I'm tired or down, it'd be perfect to lift my spirits.

312
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:37,560
You said that relationships with people can't be one-sided.

313
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,080
I don't find you entertaining, Director.

314
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,740
Isn't just meeting me good thing for your life?

315
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:46,510
I think it's best to meet people like you on television.

316
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,860
I actually am a fan of Chaebols.

317
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:53,740
But I'm changing my mind after meeting you.
- What's wrong with me?

318
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,370
I already told you before.

319
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:00,000
The hella series?
- I don't really have a lot of joy in my life.

320
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,450
I want to keep being a Chaebol fan.

321
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:06,570
Imagining and being envious. That's actually fun.

322
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:10,820
I don't like spending time with one in real life.

323
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,780
Did I just get rejected?

324
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:36,550
You're trying really hard. Why did father appear in court?

325
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,740
What are you plotting?

326
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:41,900
If you keep eating oily foods and sweets, it will cause impact on your blood vessels.

327
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,740
- At times like this, there's a need for cleaning.
- Quit being so conceited.

328
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,540
I heard that you are staying with Tae Jin Group up until this month.

329
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:53,050
- What about after this month?
- Take your hands off this group.

330
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:58,590
I'll look for another position for you; not in the company management.
- Was I that big of a threat to you?

331
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,990
I told you that it's cleaning.

332
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:09,290
You're overly ambitious and willing to do anything for your ambition. That's an outdated form of leadership.

333
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,670
Is romanticized and an sentimental leadership

334
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:17,300
the new, modern form of leadership? You didn't even want to do management.

335
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,640
You wanted to sit in this seat, right?

336
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,910
Sit, even for a moment. I'm busy, so I need to leave.

337
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:41,080
I keep calling, but I can't get in contact with the President.

338
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:45,640
My evil thoughts that I can't carry into action...

339
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,040
I wish there was someone who can make that a reality.

340
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:53,210
I wish someone would kill him.

341
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,510
Call Han Nam Dong

342
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,910
Ahjumma!

343
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,270
There's a guest coming over, so get some tea ready. And you can go home today.

344
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,830
I'll just finish this.
- No, do it tomorrow.

345
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:13,550
Ah, yes.
- I like you because you don't ask questions.

346
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,810
What will I do with that knowledge?

347
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:18,090
Right, what would you do?

348
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:22,550
I will give you money, so buy groceries before you arrive. You must buy it from the food market at Yoo Min Department Store.

349
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:26,320
It's the market where only the wealthy go. Don't buy it from normal marketplace.

350
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,960
Yes.

351
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,860
Oh my, you shouldn't have.

352
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,910
Ah, have a seat here.
- Yes.

353
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:42,430
The President arrived. He's going to come soon.

354
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,590
Thank you for listening to my request.

355
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:48,240
No... I'm on your side.

356
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:54,920
I'm sorry. But when father arrives, could you give us some time alone, aunty?

357
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:58,580
I was going to leave anyway.

358
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:02,600
I want to help your mother with the bazaar.

359
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,370
I think he's here.

360
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:09,370
You came?

361
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,950
I'll be leaving.

362
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,970
I came because I need to talk to you.

363
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,640
Gyung Joon is deceiving you.

364
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,790
Examine this, please.

365
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:38,950
It's unfair for me to be the only one to be kicked out.

366
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:42,910
Then, what do you want to do?

367
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,070
You love Gyung Joon.

368
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,580
If you want to make a deal with me,

369
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,680
you should have brought something that would benefit me.

370
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,300
You can't bring a bait.

371
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,390
Welcome. It's made with 100% organic mung beans. Would you like to try one?

372
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:11,550
Should I?

373
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,680
Oh my!
- It's okay. Take this one.

374
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,690
It's good. I should buy it.

375
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:24,280
I'll come after I buy all of my groceries.

376
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,760
Okay. Come back later.

377
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:32,930
For this bazaar, we have to promote it well in order to turn the public sentiment around.

378
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:37,610
That we're doing this not because of the secret fund scandal but because this is part of our company ethics.

379
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:40,720
Did I have an appointment?
- No.

380
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:47,120
Hello, Hyungnim. I can't just stay still when you're doing good deeds.

381
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,770
You can't come without any prior appointment.

382
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:57,640
We're a family. Families don't need to make appointments. Get me some tea.

383
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:05,300
Hyungnim, you don't even tell me to take a seat?

384
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,610
Since you're not saying much,

385
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:14,080
I feel a bit awkward.

386
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:20,430
Right now, Ye Won is at my house.

387
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:22,410
The president is too.

388
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:26,900
It felt nice seeing Ye Won at my house.

389
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,820
Are you ignoring me? Why don't you reply?

390
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:39,460
I don't know what to say because I'm seeing something so out of the ordinary.

391
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:45,490
Right? After I slapped her, I also thought that was too much.

392
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:49,640
But living is... Hyungnim, not really ordinary, no?

393
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,150
Look at our relationship.

394
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:55,370
Who would imagine this?

395
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:58,350
Now, you just have to get used to it.

396
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:01,350
Even if this world isn't ordinary,

397
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:04,840
there have to be people who stand up for propriety.

398
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,320
I have an appointment, so I have to go.

399
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,040
Thank you for thinking about the bazaar.

400
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:15,360
You're telling me to leave.

401
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,930
Hyungnim, goodbye.

402
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:30,160
Invite me to your Pyungchangdong house too. I want to see how you live.

403
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:49,590
Call Ye Won and tell her to come home.

404
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:57,800
I'm disappointed. You think you can lead the group when you can't even block Ye Won?

405
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,670
From now on, start from base zero again.

406
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:04,510
Leave the group's headquarter and go to the outpost!

407
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,900
I don't want to.
- You don't want to?

408
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,780
Since when did your opinions matter more than mine? Get out!

409
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,900
Thank you.

410
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,790
Wel-

411
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:33,690
You really came.
- I said I'd come back.

412
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:36,850
There are lot more people who don't come afterwards.

413
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:39,710
Isn't it tiring to be facing people?

414
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:44,420
A little bit.
- I know that feeling too.

415
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:46,490
Thank you.

416
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:49,610
Pack me two of these.
- Of course.

417
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:00,940
Do you know him?
- My son.

418
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:05,760
You're Deputy Choi's mother?

419
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:09,070
You know my son?
- Of course. I do!

420
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:13,290
Call him.
- No, it's fine. I don't want to act like I know him. It will interfere.

421
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:17,690
You won't bother him. He'll like it. Deputy Choi!

422
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:27,730
I didn't want to act like I saw you. I didn't want to annoy you.

423
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:30,490
I'm not annoyed.
- I told you.

424
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:33,960
You're mother didn't want to, I'm the one who made the fuss.

425
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,770
You're not making a fuss, you're being affable.

426
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:40,680
I'm Jang Yoon Ha, a part-timer. Come here more often.

427
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:44,620
Even if you told me not to, I should come more often to see you.

428
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:48,540
Do you want tea?
- I have to make food for your father.

429
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,860
But I should have some tea, right?

430
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,440
Let's go.

431
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,370
He's blunt. He wasn't like this when he was little.

432
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:57,490
Let's go together to have to some tea.

433
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,750
You're making her feel uncomfortable, Mom.
- I am aren't I?

434
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:03,240
Then, let's meet again.

435
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,070
Wait!

436
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,730
You came early.

437
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:28,180
This room is sound proof so it feels so isolated.

438
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,830
What were you thinking going to Han Nam Dong?

439
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:33,260
It's been a while since you moved to this room, right?

440
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,690
We've been using separate bedrooms since last year, too.

441
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:42,030
Don't change the subject. What did you talk about with just your dad?

442
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:50,030
Mom.

443
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:52,560
I don't want to live.

444
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,810
What do I have?

445
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:03,530
Marriage full of formality? Company anniversary?

446
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:09,500
What did I do so wrong?

447
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,690
Did someone say something to you?

448
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:16,590
Gyung Joon is trying to kick me out of the company.

449
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:19,130
Do I have anything more than work?

450
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:22,110
What am I supposed to do after leaving the company?

451
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:28,890
Am I supposed to wait for death living with a such a cold man? Making it my life's goal for him to look at me once?

452
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:32,690
Money doesn't matter when I'm about to die.

453
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:38,090
Am I asking for too much? If they gave me one part of the company...

454
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:42,650
I'd work hard to live according to your's and dad's will.

455
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:45,550
I have no idea what you're talking about.

456
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:49,470
Why is Gyung Joon trying to kick you out? Did you do something wrong?

457
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:54,320
Even if I did something wrong, I'm his older sister. I'm better than a stranger.

458
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,170
I... I wouldn't feel like this is unfair if I was doing this for myself only.

459
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:01,950
Then you should beg Gyung Joon.

460
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:08,010
Why are you acting like you're scheming something with your father? Especially at Han Nam Dong.

461
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:11,730
Father told me to meet him there.

462
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:15,010
Do you think I would want to see that garbage Han Nam Dong?

463
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:21,920
It's not bad to leave the company and enjoy your hobbies.

464
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,710
You like looking at exhibitions.

465
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,730
Mom, did you hear what I've told you so far?

466
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:39,990
The one who likes looking at exhibitions is Gyung Joon.

467
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:45,160
Anyway, follow what Gyung Joon tells you to do.

468
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:55,570
What would I expect from Mom.

469
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,470
I should have gone to get the drinks.

470
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:05,780
It's fine. Make the man do the chores when you're at places like these.

471
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:08,810
You can speak informally to me.

472
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:12,530
I told you to let the man do this at these types of places.
- Please sit.

473
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:18,130
Joon Ki is good at this. He helped me a lot while he was growing up. This is for you, Miss Jang Yoon Ha.

474
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:21,410
You remember my name?
- Yes, I remember things I hear easily.

475
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:23,670
Deputy Choi's intelligence must take after you.

476
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:28,630
Joon Ki takes after his father. My husband is smarter than I am.

477
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:31,810
Yes? Oh. Yes, this is he.

478
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:33,710
Yes, I am Deputy Choi Joon Ki from Yoo Min Department Store who called you earlier.

479
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:38,970
He's never even been to Japan. I don't understand how he speaks Japanese, it's a wonder.

480
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:45,510
I have to leave first.
- Go, I'm going to be with Yoon Ha for a bit.

481
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,490
Do as you please.

482
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:54,320
Aigoo. It's Joon Ki's father. He made something again when he shouldn't have.

483
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,250
My husband fried tofu.

484
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:59,690
Wow! He made them pretty.

485
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:04,300
Then, I... Heart. (Send heart emoticon)

486
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:12,410
I should get going. I'm afraid of him making food while waiting for me to come home.

487
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:15,270
Why does that make you afraid? Don't you like it?

488
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:16,870
His body is not well.

489
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:23,740
He's improved a lot through rehab training but I would rather him be comfortable rather than trying to do things on my behalf.

490
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,890
You seem like a really good person.

491
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:27,590
How do you know when you just met me?

492
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:30,870
I know. I'll walk you to over there.

493
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:33,400
Yeah?
- Yes.

494
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:49,330
You were adorable back then.

495
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:53,620
"Mom, in America, do you get money if you donate your hair?"

496
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:58,770
"If they talked it out, one person would've gotten what they wanted. So disappointing."

497
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:03,850
Hm... "Since they got to know how big their love is for each other,

498
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:07,910
they received the best Christmas gift. Gyung Joon,

499
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:10,980
a person's heart is more important than money."

500
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:16,730
You gave me a lot of happiness when you were growing up.

501
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:24,460
Ye Won came and left. I don't know what's going on, but don't kick her out completely.

502
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:29,270
Parents like it when siblings get along.

503
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,360
You're strong.

504
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:36,740
What are you saying out of the blue?
- That's how much I trust you.

505
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:40,510
Don't worry about sis. I'll settle it at the appropriate extent.

506
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:46,040
I'm going to leave this affair to father, and I'm going to go on vacation.

507
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,790
What kind of vacation?

508
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:49,780
To clear my head a bit.

509
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:55,710
And plan out the group's future. I'm taking Yoon Ha, too.

510
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:58,290
Why are you taking her?
- I'll be bored alone.

511
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,830
Let us enjoy our stay there.

512
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:06,970
Okay. But why her? You have me, too.

513
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:10,170
You should be next to father during this time.

514
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:14,690
I'll help you clean up.

515
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:16,810
Are you going to throw away this, too?
- Status Anxiety by Alain de Botton -

516
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:20,690
No, I'm going to take it with me on the trip.

517
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,720
You enjoy a variety of sports.

518
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:46,310
When I was training, I got awards for being a good shooter.

519
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:50,450
We chose the guests for our special event after remodeling. They'll demonstrate cooking show on the spot.

520
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:57,600
By the way, shouldn't we examine what happened in launching the premium market for the upper class target, first?

521
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:01,710
I mean, I did put it together but the results aren't too good...

522
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:04,490
It makes me wonder if we shouldn't examine it from the launch of it.

523
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:06,950
That's a good point.
- What are you doing now?

524
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:10,680
I'm supposed to go to the company get-together dinner with everyone, including the part-time employees.

525
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,830
Then Lee Ji Yi is coming too, huh?
- Leave her alone. Don't make the innocent girl get the wrong idea.

526
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:17,950
Why are you talking like I'm going to do something, when I didn't yet?

527
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:20,140
You're making me want to.
- Don't.

528
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:23,950
Play with a girl who meets your standards. I'm leaving.

529
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:27,190
Hey, let's go together. I have to leave.

530
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:34,900
Oh my, it's so good!

531
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,130
Here.

532
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:39,390
I can't drink soju that well. Can I just drink soda?

533
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:43,900
Pork Belly means Soju. Why are you so picky as a part-time employee?

534
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,480
Pour it then.

535
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:58,010
How can you drink by yourself? Pour me a shot, too.

536
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:59,850
Yes.

537
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,450
Is it tasty?
- Yes.

538
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:11,030
The pork belly here is good.
- Now it's our turn, Deputy.

539
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,930
Order more meat.

540
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:19,530
Excuse me, can you give us two more servings of pork belly?

541
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:24,910
Everyone, cheers! His position may be just deputy,

542
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:30,550
but his work is that of a director. For our remodeling, Deputy Choi, can you say a few words?

543
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:33,450
Okay, let's just say that. Let's do our best!

544
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:35,630
Cheers!
- Cheers!

545
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:39,790
Girls always try to act cute. Yum, yum, it's tasty.

546
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:44,790
Oh, there's none left.
- This is a first. Including all the part-time employees as well.

547
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:48,670
We can't just leave you guys out of the company dinner.

548
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:53,010
But why do you speak formally to Ji Yi?

549
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:55,490
Just speak informally to me as well. It feels more friendly.

550
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:57,030
I will, if you want.

551
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:59,640
Wow, how nice.

552
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:10,230
Oh, Director! The director is here, the director is here!

553
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:13,530
Everyone sit, sit.

554
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:17,160
I heard there was a company dinner so I stopped by on my way home.

555
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,230
In hopes of turning over a new leaf and to do well together,

556
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,980
the second round is on me.

557
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:26,670
Second round is on you? Woooooo!

558
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:36,920
Deputy...

559
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,350
Thank you.

560
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:44,600
For what?

561
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:49,970
For being considerate while drinking... And reinstating me...

562
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,530
I'm like that with everyone.

563
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,300
I knew you'd be like that. But I'm still thankful.

564
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,690
You know when a person tells a personal story to someone else for the first time...

565
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:25,070
"You're the first person I'm telling"

566
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:27,500
and tells you something they haven't told anyone else...

567
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,350
If he's a guy, it's 100% a ploy.

568
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:32,590
Unless it was Deputy Choi.

569
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:36,520
That's what he said and revealed something personal.

570
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:57,260
Do you know the greatest part about a one-sided crush?

571
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,800
What?

572
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:05,530
Both the beginning and the end are of my accord,

573
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:07,990
I'm done with Deputy Choi.

574
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:11,160
Done? Why?

575
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,750
I heard the girl shouldn't like the guy more in a relationship.

576
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:19,880
What's important about who likes whom first? The important thing is that you're dating.

577
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:24,350
You can have him.

578
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,850
I think Choi Joon Ki likes you.

579
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:31,740
No, why would he?

580
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:35,380
I saw everything earlier when he poured you water instead of alcohol.

581
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:38,200
He said he would do that for anyone.

582
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:42,830
He even gave you the potato dish. Would he do that for someone he wasn't interested in?

583
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:45,430
It means he is was looking at you.

584
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:49,540
Is that so?

585
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,540
You like him, too.

586
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:57,140
What? No!

587
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,710
His mother is nice.

588
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:05,780
His parents have a good relationship and remain optimistic even in the midst of difficult situations.

589
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:09,470
What kind of bullshit are you talking about now...

590
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:11,130
Because you like him...

591
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:14,250
you like his parents as well.

592
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:16,930
Hey.

593
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:21,250
Why is that a reason for you to stop liking him?

594
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:28,820
I want you to be happy.

595
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:35,670
When I didn't want to live... When I was living in my own misery...

596
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:40,310
I met a man loved...

597
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:44,780
And because of that man, your heart got better.

598
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:47,970
Because his parents refused to accept us, I let him go.

599
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:52,790
I don't want to marry someone whose parents oppose the marriage.

600
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:55,970
Choi Joon Ki's parents would never refuse a marriage.

601
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:58,340
Jang Yoon Ha, you idiot.

602
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:04,840
You're my only friend and family.

603
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:16,460
I hope that you find a man who will make your heart happy–like I did.

604
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:28,170
I'm speaking from experience but Choi Joon Ki is interested in you.

605
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:34,230
A good man will make you look at the world positively.

606
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,240
What are you doing?

607
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,230
The president ordered this...

608
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:12,430
Gyung Joon that bastard.

609
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:16,430
Director, you were so cool tonight.

610
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:19,460
We're all members of your fan club starting tonight.

611
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:23,370
Fan club, cheer!
- Woooooh!

612
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:26,730
If you ever have any problem, tell Deputy Choi anytime.

613
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:29,130
I've prepared the car for you. Let's go.

614
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:32,710
-We'll see you tomorrow.
-We'll see you tomorrow.
-We'll see you tomorrow.

615
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,640
Let's go!

616
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,210
Do you not want to head home?

617
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:43,120
You should go!

618
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,880
You ladies are okay to head home, right?

619
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:56,180
I think Yoon Ha is a little drunk. Could you take her home?

620
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:56,950
I can go on my own!

621
00:44:56,950 --> 00:45:00,190
Please, Deputy. I'm asking you. I'll work hard!

622
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:02,850
Where's your house? It's in Donamdong!

623
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:11,850
Goodbye!

624
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:13,170
Hey!

625
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,400
I'll call you a taxi.

626
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:34,930
After a company dinner, if a man whom you're not close with offer to take you home, you have to refuse it.

627
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:40,650
♫ Please stop coming close to me ♫

628
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:47,550
♫ Please stop smiling as well ♫

629
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:51,760
Donamdong, please.
♫ If I start to want you ♫

630
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,040
Thank you.
♫ If I start to want you ♫

631
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:01,790
♫ It will hurt a lot ♫

632
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,300
♫ Please don’t dream of me ♫

633
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:14,900
♫ I’m also pushing you away like this ♫

634
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:19,480
I want you to be happy.

635
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:24,330
I hope that you find
♫ Please stop coming close to me ♫

636
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:27,640
a man who will make your heart happy, like I did.
♫ Please stop coming close to me ♫

637
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:31,210
♫ Because your warmth will surely shake me up ♫

638
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:34,000
I don't know why I want to tell you this...
♫ Because your warmth will surely shake me up ♫

639
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,160
It's a personal story... And I don't
♫ As much as I am holding back from you ♫

640
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:40,430
tell personal things to people I'm not close to.
♫ As much as I am holding back from you ♫

641
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:44,520
♫ As much as I am holding back from you ♫
♫ It may hurt but I have to hold back from you ♫

642
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:52,640
Ahjussi, can you go to Seongbukdong?
♫ It may hurt but I have to hold back from you ♫

643
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:11,230
She's not here.

644
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,490
If she's not here, I'll just go there.

645
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:23,770
Let's work hard! Let's work hard!

646
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:26,590
Let's continue to live diligently.

647
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:29,930
If you continue to live like that, you'll meet a man you'll love.

648
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:33,330
Why are you coming back so late?
- Oh! You surprised me.

649
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:37,480
Isn't it too dark here? Isn't it dangerous?

650
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:42,170
You're more dangerous!

651
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:45,390
Hey! Why am I dangerous?

652
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:54,720
Are you not cold?

653
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,840
I like the Republic of Korea.

654
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:01,340
Really? I like Mansae.
(play on words/names of "Hurray Republic of Korea" or the names of the triplets on Superman is Back)

655
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:03,790
I'm saying I like our country.

656
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:07,090
You're living in a place like this and you like it...?

657
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:12,020
I'm happy with the fact that when I wake up in the morning, the sun is shining.

658
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,830
I guess a person who lived so comfortably that the chairs from the street vendors are uncomfortable wouldn't know...

659
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:20,630
How long are you going to bring that up?

660
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:23,740
I think the background is really important for people.

661
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:27,510
When I knew you as an unemployed loser, you looked like you were imprudent and good-for-nothing.

662
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:29,550
And I thought, "where could you even go to earn enough to eat and live?"

663
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:32,080
Hey! Even so, I...

664
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,890
But now that I know you're a chaebol's son...

665
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:38,820
All your actions are great and you're good looking...

666
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,800
and cool.

667
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,790
That's me?
- Yes.

668
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:50,330
When I first met you, I didn't feel inferior...

669
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:53,370
Now when you're in front of me, I feel inferior... I don't like that.

670
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,890
Why feel inferior because of me?

671
00:48:56,730 --> 00:48:58,960
You don't have to feel like that.

672
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:02,980
I'm close to Joon Ki! His situation is like your situation...

673
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:06,300
But we're still friends. There's nothing to it.

674
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:10,770
It's a little funny how you're like this just because I gave you a compliment.

675
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:14,830
It's funny, right? I told you, I'm fun, too.

676
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:26,260
I can't live anywhere else because I only know Korean.

677
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:29,490
But you can live in another country besides this one.

678
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:32,860
Now you're trying to emigrate me by force.

679
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:34,500
I like our country, too.

680
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:39,300
I'm saying... I'm desperate because I only have this place to live.

681
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:42,640
But you have a choice.

682
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:48,560
I know what it's like to be in a relationship. Because I was in one.

683
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:52,630
When a man comes to a woman's house... Green light.

684
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:59,620
I'm not interested in a relationship that won't work out.

685
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,720
What's a successful relationship?

686
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:07,450
Marriage?
- Yes.
- Ah, so simple.

687
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:10,250
We're only in our 20s. You should think more progressively.

688
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:15,910
In my experience, those who don't link dating to marriage were a**holes.

689
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:22,300
Liking me is your prerogative

690
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:24,910
but don't tell me you like me.

691
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:30,950
Because... I think I might fall for you.

692
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:37,110
Okay then... Goodnight.

693
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:48,220
Did I just get rejected again? She really gets my competitive spirit up.

694
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:50,000
She's an expert.

695
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:04,840
Ahjussi!
- Why are you out and about by yourself so late at night?

696
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:09,640
You even drank!
- Don't worry.

697
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:12,420
Did my brother come home yet?
- Yes, why?

698
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:16,010
I have something that I want to tell him first.

699
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:21,950
I thought you were a coward but I guess you did inherit father's blood.

700
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:29,140
You acting like this doesn't change anything. Don't get so emotional.
- How dare you take advantage of father?

701
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:32,300
How dare you manipulate father?
- Get out.

702
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:36,110
I put up with all of your tantrums because I felt bad for you.
- I'm not done.

703
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:40,120
You'll be surprised at just how much I know about you; more than you know yourself.

704
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:42,560
You're taking medication for depression, right?

705
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:47,630
You think that's it? I'm taking other medications as well.

706
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:53,120
- Looking at you makes me disgusted that we're the same human beings.
- Same goes for me.

707
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:56,340
Where do you get off living off our parents' backs with no skills?

708
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:59,570
For how long are you going to mistakenly think you have skills?

709
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:04,060
Even without me, you'll never be king. I guarantee it.

710
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:24,930
Big sis...

711
00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:31,340
Oppa...

712
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:38,060
Daebak, did the oldest sister do this?

713
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:53,120
What is this?
- If something happens to me, you find it and open it.

714
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,230
I don't want to.

715
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:05,610
Why would something happen to you? That'll never happen.

716
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:09,940
Let's go out for a little bit.
Please clean this place up.

717
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,360
What is this? You're giving me goosebumps...

718
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:30,870
I know you're not in a great mood,

719
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:33,290
but I guess people are selfish...

720
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:37,570
I'm in a good mood today... I can't really hide it.

721
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,390
- Spread that good mood to me.
- Oppa, do you know?

722
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:48,220
Things that don't seem like much can all align one day and become something meaningful?

723
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:52,220
- Put it plainly.
- You know I have this wariness when it comes to men...

724
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,610
You do...
- But this guy makes me feel reassured.

725
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:57,350
I met his mother.

726
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:01,160
There's someone you like, huh?

727
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:03,770
You already met his mother?

728
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:07,720
No, just by coincidence. Yes, coincidence.

729
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:10,240
What could be more innocent than coincidence?

730
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:12,650
This man doesn't like me yet...

731
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:17,640
But everything seemed to align and it felt something like fate.

732
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:24,960
Only you like him?
- For now...

733
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,860
No, it could be forever...

734
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:33,280
Hurry up and tell him you like him.

735
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:37,910
I heard guys don't like it when girls confess first.

736
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:41,280
When it's not a girl they're into, they don't like it.

737
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:45,600
But when a pretty girl confesses first, a guy will always welcome that.

738
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:49,220
Is it like that?
- It is. Tell him how you feel.

739
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:53,330
There's nothing more foolish than holding back "I like you" for years.

740
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:58,160
Really?
- Holding on to it will turn it into poop.

741
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:01,420
This is the word from the your living romance bible.

742
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:04,320
Remember it in your head.
-I don't want to.

743
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,590
I'll remember it in my heart.

744
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:15,220
And what happens if I start liking you?

745
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:17,930
What?

746
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:23,970
Let's see who the real winner is.

747
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:26,420
My first technique is marriage.

748
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,350
I'm going to marry the daughter of Taejin group I'm being set up with today.

749
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:31,120
Do you know me?

750
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:45,140
If you meet 3 times coincidentally, they say it's fate.

751
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,600
I don't believe in fate.

752
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:52,120
I only make choices.
