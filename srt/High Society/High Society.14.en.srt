1
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,990
Why?

2
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,390
I have to talk to you.

3
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,730
Move.

4
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,970
Wow. How can you be so emotionless?

5
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,650
Same for you.

6
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:07,390
I think I've gotten weird ever since I met Lee Ji Yi.

7
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:11,890
My romance cells have all died. I used to not be like this.

8
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,030
How were you?

9
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:18,490
I used to drink and play with girls even if I'm wasn't attracted to them.

10
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:21,370
But now I can't do it. It's so boring.

11
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:24,230
Are you saying I'm boring?

12
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:27,300
You're not a girl. You're a little sister.

13
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,530
I was originally picky.

14
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:34,840
I went on a couple of dates, had a fling for a couple of months, and had a relationship

15
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,260
but it was never hot.

16
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,330
Then how did you fall so quickly for Joon Gi?

17
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:45,700
If I think about it now, it's a mystery. I thought it was fate back then.

18
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,620
There are a lot of girls who think love is fate.

19
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:52,340
Don't guys think it's a choice?

20
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,900
Normally. How did you know?

21
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,420
That's why Joon Gi and I are like this.

22
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:04,260
For me, it was fate. For him, it was a choice. There was a conflict between the two.

23
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,440
But Joon Gi...

24
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,440
really loved you.

25
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,780
I knew about Joon Gi but I didn't say...

26
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,340
He told me this before you found out about him.

27
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:26,440
"Just because an intention is impure, doesn't mean the process is too."

28
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:39,230
What's the use of saying that now.

29
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,630
It's about time for Ji Yi to show up.

30
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,030
Really? I should leave.

31
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,910
Okay then.

32
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,540
Deputy, what's going on?

33
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,740
Chang Soo is inside. Will you be okay?

34
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,630
Deputy, I think I'm going to leave. You should go in.

35
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:21,600
If you leave, I should leave, too. I don't even have an appointment.

36
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,100
You want to see Yoon Ha.

37
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,500
I don't want to suddenly appear and throw her off.

38
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
Will you really be okay?

39
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,780
I'm okay. Let's go.

40
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,960
High Society
Episode 14

41
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,530
Hello?

42
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,310
Why aren't you coming?

43
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,430
Isn't Director Jerk there?

44
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:14,350
Yeah... he was here. He just stopped by to take care of something.

45
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,350
How did you know?

46
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:18,170
To be honest, I went with Deputy Manager.

47
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,890
I asked him to go with me.

48
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:24,250
He saw the two of you so we left.

49
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,610
With Joon Gi...?

50
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,610
You saw Chang Soo and me together?

51
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,930
I didn't but Deputy Manager did.

52
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,890
Don't you want to see Deputy Manager?

53
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:39,110
No, I don't.

54
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,570
Then I'll send him home and go over.

55
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:51,610
Oh, no-no. Ji Yi, today's not a good day. Let's meet tomorrow.

56
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:55,430
Yeah, I'll call you later. Sorry!

57
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,370
Why are you back?

58
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:02,550
I saw Joon Gi and Ji Yi leaving together and thought they wouldn't come here.

59
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,360
I'm going to have one more drink before I leave.

60
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:13,360
What are we doing? I lied to Ji Yi.

61
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,860
I think something came up with Yoon Ha. She can't meet today.

62
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:31,540
Ji Yi seems so comfortable around Joon Gi.

63
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,310
I thought that, too.

64
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:40,830
Ji Yi will live well no matter who she marries.

65
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:47,970
Joon Gi, too, will live well no matter who he marries.

66
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:52,550
Joon Gi...? He will. But Min Jeong...

67
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,650
Sorry.

68
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:59,770
It's okay. I... met her because she wanted to meet.

69
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:02,570
Why is she like that?

70
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,430
Anyway, with Min Jeong, too... her conditions were good.

71
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,630
She was a B. He matched all of that.

72
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,710
That girl... he didn't love her.

73
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,200
How do you know?

74
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,980
He matched everything because he had a motive.

75
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:22,520
If he loved her, he would have pointed things out with that personality.

76
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,420
Do you believe that?

77
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:32,790
I am believing those words... At some point, I guess I started to believe in it.

78
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,850
I should get up now.

79
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,420
Are you going home?

80
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:43,670
No, I'm going back to work. I'm so bad at it.

81
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:47,830
I only have my effort. And I only got in based on my connections.

82
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:54,490
"There's no status for makeup"... I think that's okay.

83
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:58,170
Right? No matter who, they are equal in front of makeup.

84
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:01,250
A daughter of a chaebol or a girl like myself uses the same makeup.

85
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,530
I think it'd be better if a famous person put this on their SNS rather than yours.

86
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,750
Don't you think Yoon Ha knows a lot of famous people?

87
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,140
A .gif file or a short clip would be better than a picture.

88
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:14,440
I'll ask the professionals in this area to make one.

89
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:19,400
Then...I'll talk to Yoon Ha tomorrow and send you the video.

90
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,480
Okay.

91
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,440
We should get going. Are you going home?

92
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,860
Yes. What about you?

93
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,200
I'm going back to work. There's nothing else to do.

94
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:37,080
There is some news regarding Vice President Jang Gyeong Joon.

95
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,600
It's something that will shock the President.

96
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,600
What is it? Is there something?

97
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,860
There's a possibility... that he's alive.

98
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,270
How?

99
00:07:55,970 --> 00:08:01,090
When you cook meat, try to remove all the fat and maximize the protein.

100
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,050
He won't eat it if it doesn't taste good.

101
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:06,480
Yes. I'll get the recipe.

102
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,570
Make it 7 in the morning and make sure the whole family can eat together.

103
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,550
Okay.

104
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,150
I have something to tell you.

105
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,430
What is it?

106
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,770
I have something to report regarding Gyeong Joon.

107
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,930
Is there something new?

108
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:29,450
There's no activity in the accounts but the company presented a new opinion.

109
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,330
What opinion?

110
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:34,670
They're wondering if it's a voluntary disappearance.

111
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,510
What is a voluntary disappearance?

112
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,950
It's when someone disappears from their current life to

113
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:44,950
live as a new person, in a new place, for a new life.

114
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,330
No way!

115
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:51,470
Then you mean Gyeong Joon stabbed a dagger into his family

116
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:54,380
so he can disappear and live a new life?

117
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,760
I'll tell you after more investigation.

118
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,620
It's not sure for now.

119
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,360
That's nonsense.

120
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,380
I've never heard of this kind of thing.

121
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,160
It's not something that never happens.

122
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,720
There was a time when it was a social phenomenon.

123
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:17,080
Since nothing is for sure yet, I wanted to tell you even if it's small.

124
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,960
I'm here. - Mom

125
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:20,770
I heard you ate ramen as dinner. Is that enough?

126
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,730
Still, why did you come? You must be tired.

127
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:26,650
This is not tiring. I can do this a hundred times.

128
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,130
You like fried tofu rice balls.

129
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:34,050
I packed one more lunch box, so take it and eat more.

130
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,810
How long do you have to stay?
- Just a little more.

131
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:40,140
I have my work... and someone else's work as well.

132
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,260
Someone else's work? Whose?

133
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,100
Yoon Ha.

134
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,200
Yoon Ha?

135
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,240
I thought you broke up with her.

136
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,240
I did, but because we're in the same company.

137
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,330
It's her first time in an organization and she has a heavy responsibility.

138
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,960
She's unfamiliar with work.

139
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,200
Good for you!

140
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,510
My son. You're this kind of person!

141
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:11,790
I was suspicious of you for a bit.

142
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:15,220
Mom is so bad!

143
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,420
What are you saying?

144
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:21,330
No, I heard some strange rumors about you, that you-

145
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:24,380
Nevermind.

146
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,820
Do you still work at that house?

147
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:32,940
I was about to quit, but she came to the house and pleaded.

148
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,260
You don't like it?
- No.

149
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,620
It's your work. Do what's comfortable for you. More than my opinion.

150
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,960
She's not a bad person.

151
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:45,600
She just not careful with what she says. I've gotten used to it.

152
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,900
Then it's okay.

153
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,920
Then does Yoon Ha work in the same department as you?

154
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,480
Nope, in a different department.

155
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,990
But I'm proud of her. Her office lights were on.

156
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,780
It looks like she's working.

157
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:04,400
Oh... I haven't seen her since the last time.

158
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,740
I want to see her once.
- Don't.

159
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,280
She's weak towards you.

160
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,440
Poor Yoon Ha.

161
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,000
I saw Yoon Ha's mom.

162
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,300
The fact that she's had to live concurrently with her husband's mistress.

163
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,320
How do you think she feels?

164
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,100
She probably didn't have the luxury to think about her kids.

165
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,200
You saw her childhood photos, right?

166
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,140
That young one was alone.

167
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:37,840
Even if she was wearing a pretty dress, she was in the shade.

168
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,820
So what if you have money?

169
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,900
You eat three meals a day, not five.

170
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:48,250
Here you go again, about how rich people, too, eat three meals a day.

171
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:52,270
It's true!

172
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,720
I'm going to go in now. Give me that.

173
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,100
This, you can't.

174
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,580
Why? You told me to eat more later.
- I was about to, but now I can't.

175
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:07,260
Alright, give it to Dad.
- You've gotten brighter.

176
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,680
Is there something good going on?

177
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,640
I think I feel relieved after being honest.

178
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:18,740
Starting from my childhood, I started to hide my heart from those precious to me.

179
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,280
Just surface level interactions.

180
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,300
You were like that. Even to Mom, you started calling me "Mother" and even put a distance.

181
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,780
You called your dad, "Father."

182
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,920
Were you like that to Chang Soo, too?
- He's one of the reasons.

183
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,540
He made me open and close my heart.

184
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:38,250
That's what friends are for. You grow from fighting.

185
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:42,480
I miss Chang Soo. How's he doing?

186
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,880
He's sick.
- Sick? Where?

187
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,520
To be honest, we're all hurt, Mom.

188
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,660
We are maturing a little late.

189
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:58,540
Stand up. I'll drop you off at the front.

190
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,880
I can go by myself.

191
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,280
Okay. Thank you!

192
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,650
Yes, Mother.

193
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,810
You picked up!

194
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:28,750
Of course, I'll pick up.

195
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:32,890
I'm in your company's lobby... should I just leave?

196
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:36,120
Or can I see you?

197
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,800
I have fried tofu rice balls.

198
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,720
Are you going home?

199
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,720
Earlier...

200
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,240
did you see Chang Soo and me together?

201
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,940
I did.
- Then why did you just leave?

202
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,200
I thought Ji YI shouldn't see.

203
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,610
What did you see?

204
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,890
You two close together.

205
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,630
It might be weird for me to say this...

206
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,660
I know it's nothing.

207
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,340
I know you.

208
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,550
You're the type to move when you like someone.

209
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,780
Even Chang Soo.

210
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,020
If he likes someone, he'll move.

211
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:43,120
How are you sure that Chang Soo doesn't like me?

212
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,480
It's not that he doesn't like you,

213
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,600
but he gave so much of his heart to Ji YI.

214
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,510
He has no space for other girls.

215
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:56,200
The surprising fact is that he still possesses pure love.

216
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,470
I bought too many clothes this month.

217
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:27,720
But, oh well, I bought them because I entered a new company.

218
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,360
It's an investment.

219
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,440
Director Jerk, you bad guy.

220
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,240
It's difficult moving houses.

221
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,440
It's good to be able to live in one place.

222
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:08,450
♫  What should I do, what shall I do  ♫

223
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:14,600
Ah, mosquito!

224
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:23,170
♫  From beginning, maybe something was wrong  ♫

225
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:30,240
♫  How can love be like this, it's so hard ♫

226
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,980
♫  Every day by day that you are not here ♫

227
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:45,240
♫  All day, I think I will die from this pain in my heart ♫

228
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,720
Yoon Ha? Here!

229
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,460
Mother! How have you been?

230
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,540
Well. It's been a long time!

231
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,550
How did you know I was here?
- Joon Gi.

232
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:03,730
He said he's proud of you for working until so late.

233
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:06,610
Proud? I'm not his child.

234
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:09,660
I know, right. You're not even his child.

235
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:13,380
Did he raise you? What is there to be proud of?
- I know.

236
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:18,100
Do you like fried tofu rice balls?
- Yes! I've been hungry.

237
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,200
Thank you.

238
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,320
For what?

239
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,140
For seeing me. It must not be comfortable for you.

240
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,990
You're like a child. You have something on you lips.

241
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,280
I'm sorry.

242
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,640
I couldn't contact you after I left like that.

243
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,640
You broke up with Joon Gi. Of course, you can't contact me.

244
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,120
You don't have any fault.

245
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,240
But still... you adored me.

246
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,200
You know I adored you?

247
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,650
Yes.

248
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:58,280
I'm happy that you understand me.

249
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:03,400
There's no one more thankful than someone who understands you.

250
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,540
It's not easy to understand someone.

251
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:12,320
I'm sad that this is the end of us,

252
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,470
but I'm happy I met you.

253
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,960
Me, too.

254
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,540
If Joon Gi did any wrong to you,

255
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:30,320
don't forgive nor understand him. Hate him.

256
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,450
It sounds like you're being ironic.

257
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:36,980
I got caught.

258
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,240
Oh my, Chang Soo!

259
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,980
How much did you drink?

260
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,960
I didn't drink that much.

261
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,630
Did you meet Yoon Ha?

262
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,480
Hey! Why are you like this?

263
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,750
Mom!

264
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,390
Mom!

265
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:50,050
I'm going crazy, really.

266
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,790
Why?

267
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:58,610
What is this? What is this?

268
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,720
What is this?

269
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:08,140
What did Yoon Ha say? Did something go wrong when you met with Yoon Ha?

270
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,240
Really!

271
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,300
Chang Soo, why are you being like this exactly? Huh?

272
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,250
You have to tell me. Speak!

273
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:28,810
I can't do this. I really can't do this.

274
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:30,850
Hey!

275
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:38,210
I'm having a really hard time.

276
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:45,230
Don't. My heart is going to rip into pieces.

277
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:54,910
I thought I could get married even if I didn't love the woman.

278
00:21:56,030 --> 00:22:02,890
Even if I didn't love her, I thought I could live.

279
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,790
But...?

280
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:14,460
I can't do it. I don't want to live!

281
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:30,440
Is marriage such a big deal? Just meet a girl with a similar background as you and carry on meeting your close friends...

282
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,840
and I thought I could just have a kid and live well.

283
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,720
Everyone marries like that and lives.

284
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,440
I don't think I can do that.

285
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,960
Is it because of Lee Ji Yi?

286
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,240
Because of her.

287
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,720
You like her that much?

288
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,280
No.

289
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,380
I love her.

290
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:03,050
This is the cheer given only to Jang Yoon Ha.
- Joon Gi

291
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:50,370
Don't misunderstand. I only came to give this to you.

292
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:56,390
You came here right on time.

293
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:01,050
What is that?

294
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:03,310
The phone number for the one in charge of the department store in Shanghai.

295
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:06,290
And the number for the director of the location in SE Asia.

296
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:08,710
I've already given them calls.

297
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:12,450
Just call them tomorrow and send them the revenue reports in the mail.

298
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,730
What the heck!

299
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:21,310
This can't be for free. Doing all this was hard.

300
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:26,410
Although I want to say I don't need it, I need it so give it to me.

301
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,630
What shall I do?

302
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:41,210
First, drink this.

303
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:55,510
If you want to work well then in the beginning you have to listen well.

304
00:25:55,510 --> 00:26:01,010
If you are a team leader, you have to maximize your team member's skill.

305
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:08,510
If you want to do that, you have to show your humane side or skill.

306
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:15,670
I met your mother. She's always good whenever I see her.

307
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,220
I was wrong.

308
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,540
I acted childish.

309
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:46,060
Revenge and whatnot, and telling you that I'm not going to allow you to come here.

310
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:50,400
You, really.

311
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,280
I'm really, what?

312
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:57,460
You consent easily, reflect upon yourself well, and are easy to persuade.

313
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:00,140
Are you telling me that I'm easily deceived like that?

314
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,100
Yeah.
- Tch.

315
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:06,440
You are trying to climb up to me now that I let you talk back to me.

316
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,260
No matter what it is, I try to get into any cracks. You shouldn't have shown your cracks to me.

317
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,450
Now you are giving me advice.

318
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:15,550
Do you want to go out for fresh air?

319
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,230
No.

320
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:36,070
I like walking. Not parks but places that have fresh air.

321
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:40,470
I wanted a simple life. Walking in a quiet park with children.

322
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:44,090
But why is living an ordinary life so hard for me?

323
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:46,790
I was never interested in a simple life.

324
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:50,590
When I was younger, I laughed while living a simple life.

325
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,950
I thought that was happiness.

326
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:55,770
But life isn't only lived with family.

327
00:27:55,770 --> 00:28:02,240
Did you know that you have what I dream of, and I have what you dream of?

328
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,920
I know.

329
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:06,680
Do you want to hold hands and walk?

330
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,080
This is a technique.

331
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,780
Why do you keep going over the line?

332
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,680
It's obvious that you can't work well. Work...

333
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:21,500
You learn the basics after going through steps, but you don't have any.

334
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,980
Is this how you hook (meaning tempt) people?

335
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,140
Have you been hooked? It's a skill.

336
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,070
Ugh, really.

337
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:29,850
You like my technique. You came over it well.

338
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:33,390
Why are you suddenly like this? Do I look easy because I can't work?

339
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,330
Yes, you look easy.

340
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:40,030
I still haven't forgiven you. Having this kind of conversation is comfortable.

341
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:45,320
We communicated with our body often. I think it's because of that. We are familiar with each other.

342
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,950
You're very honest, how could you say that?

343
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,510
What words?

344
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,050
You don't even know what?

345
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:55,470
I don't know. How am I honest?

346
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,670
It's been a long time.

347
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,270
Our family is eating together after a long time.

348
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,710
You look good, Father.

349
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:21,680
Since nothing bad has happened. Now, let's eat.

350
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,240
I have something to decide.

351
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,890
There has to be a witness for death

352
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:38,400
for us to gain certainty.

353
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:42,730
Next week, I'm going to announce my appointed personnel.

354
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:47,630
I'm going to make Ye Won the sole successor.

355
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:50,910
I will work hard, Father.

356
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:53,150
What about me?

357
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:58,150
Uh, you... just stay like you are now.

358
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,620
Yoon Ha, you need to work harder.

359
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,740
I was expectant, but you aren't meeting my expectations.

360
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,800
I understand.

361
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,140
I heard news about Vice President Jang from Secretary Hong.

362
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,400
What new news could there be?

363
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,420
It's possible that he's alive.

364
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,390
Although it has not been confirmed yet.

365
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:28,410
Even when it hasn't been confirmed yet...

366
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:31,510
They probably just want to get money from a mother who lost her son.

367
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:35,710
That's not it. If you look at the investigations, there is some mystery behind it.

368
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:38,730
From the point when he went on a vacation to the point when he disappeared.

369
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:42,050
It's too clear, as if it was all planned.

370
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,990
So what is he doing right now?

371
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:49,170
Creating a new identity isn't as hard as you think.

372
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:53,410
After buying a passport from the Philippines and creating a fake identity,

373
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:55,350
he could live with that identity.

374
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,950
Then where is he right now?

375
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,470
I don't know that.

376
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:01,930
What's that about? You don't know but you're just throwing anything out there?

377
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:05,130
If this is true

378
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:10,050
and we try to match his actions to what people may take... It all adds up.

379
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:15,230
Gyeong Joon did start acting strange since the scandal with the cosmetic branch.

380
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:17,010
He did gather all the evidence as well.

381
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:19,390
He was going to hand that over to the other side...

382
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:21,570
before you put a stop to it.

383
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:25,130
Because I thought he was completely out of his mind.

384
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:27,850
That's sticking your neck out (for a blade) to your enemy.

385
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:31,010
Because Vice President Jang Ye Won was overseeing it all,

386
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:34,550
that ended the way it did.

387
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:06,390
The person you are waiting for won't be coming.

388
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:19,370
Give me the USB.

389
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,590
What happened?

390
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:25,290
You think that those people are 100% innocent? That they're gathering evidence to do right?

391
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:28,070
How could you hand over the company's secret to them? You of all people?

392
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,690
Are you still Taejin's heir?

393
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:32,630
I didn't decide to be the heir.

394
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:34,630
Don't back me into a corner with that.

395
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:39,310
Why are you being so chic about the thing that I want which you have? It hurts my pride.

396
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:44,050
What I'd bet my whole life on to get... is nothing to you?

397
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:51,110
Our wants are different. What you wanted was given to me.

398
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:54,030
The greatest honor that you could have.

399
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,690
Throw it away and step down.

400
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:58,070
I told you, it was given to me.

401
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,570
I can't throw it away.

402
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:04,050
I was always used as a tool to train and develop you.

403
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:08,090
While being used as a tool, I... became stronger.

404
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:10,990
Father knows. What are you going to do?

405
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:16,010
Of course, he'd know, since you know.

406
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:21,310
Why don't you try getting chased out for once. Then you'll see how it feels.

407
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:36,650
Congratulations, Unni.

408
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:38,510
Thank you.

409
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:42,410
You took my USB, didn't you?

410
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:46,410
Yeah. Did you check using the security camera?

411
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:51,450
But you know... you miss too many of the details. How are you going to make it in this world?

412
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:54,170
You should be relieved that you were born into this kind of household.

413
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:59,410
Like you said, I've been more guarded lately.

414
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:02,730
A few days ago, you were still pretty proud.

415
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:07,730
It seems to have died down. How is it living in reality?

416
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:11,970
It's different from trying to avoid it when you were a part-timer, huh?

417
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:22,130
I didn't avoid it. I was confronting it in my own way.

418
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:26,470
Since I am still inexperienced and it's my first time starting this job, it's a definite that I can't do well.

419
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:28,190
It will be better tomorrow.

420
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:33,090
That's right. You should live with that kind of hope at least.

421
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:37,130
If it's for the goal, you use any means.

422
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:39,270
No, I do choose carefully.

423
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:44,190
I don't do anything illegal. But what is legal?

424
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:49,530
Our brother must have had a hard time arguing with you.

425
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:53,930
Fighting is hard no matter who you're fighting against. Until you see who they really are.

426
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:04,550
Choi Joon Gi said that he was going to present his proposal and asked me to make some time tomorrow morning.

427
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:07,090
That person has nothing to do with me.

428
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:13,010
Choi Joon Gi...even though it hasn't been decided yet, he's alright.

429
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:16,810
If he was a person with no relation to you, I would have really supported him.

430
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:20,810
Unni, you're well liked by the employees at the company.

431
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:24,770
For being fair. Be fair to Choi Joon Gi as well.

432
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:27,810
To a person who used you with a plan and then came to work under me...

433
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:31,290
you still have feelings for him? That's a bit strange.

434
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:36,110
He didn't use me to get ahead. He's just ambitious.

435
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:38,370
I guess that's better.

436
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:06,690
You slept without taking a shower?

437
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:15,790
Drink this.

438
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,870
No, thanks.

439
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,230
Where are you going?

440
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:25,250
To shower, of course. I have to go to work.

441
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,290
You're not eating?

442
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:34,990
I'm not eating.

443
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,430
Why are you being like this, really?

444
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:41,110
I won't tell you to meet Yoon Ha. And I don't like Si On.

445
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:43,690
Let it go.

446
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:45,870
Mom.
- What?

447
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:50,470
I chose you. I'm going to live with you.

448
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:52,470
Hey, it's scary.

449
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:56,710
What's scary? I couldn't keep a girl, so what's there to be scared about?

450
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:59,830
I have no responsibility.
- Stop it!

451
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:05,530
Even if I die, you won't blink an eye.

452
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:09,430
Mom and Dad have three children. I'm one of them.

453
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,510
If one of them dies, two are left.

454
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:15,810
You! What a horrible thing to say.
How could you say that without blinking?

455
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:18,830
You started this.

456
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:22,730
Okay. I got it, so let's eat.

457
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:25,510
Let's eat first and then go to work.

458
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:28,510
I don't have an appetite.

459
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:34,310
Ah, I'm going crazy because of him!

460
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:47,530
What is it?

461
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:50,070
You had something to say to me yesterday, but you couldn't say it.

462
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:53,410
You don't look very good.

463
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:57,930
No, I lied to you yesterday.

464
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:01,770
When you said you were coming, Chang Soo was there.

465
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:06,630
It was like that. You did well.

466
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:10,590
If I heard you guys were together, I would have been really upset.

467
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,250
You guys are close.

468
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:15,570
While he was going out, he saw you and Choi Joon Gi together.

469
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:18,390
After he saw that, he came back in.

470
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,030
You match with Director Jerk.

471
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:25,150
When you guys are together, you both look comfortable.

472
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:29,340
Chang Soo and I talked about the same thing.

473
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:32,810
That when you and Joon Gi are together, you both look comfortable.

474
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,510
I guess the similarities met yesterday.

475
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:37,370
Chang Soo and I, the losers of love.

476
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:40,390
Me and Deputy Choi, the losers of money.

477
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:43,730
In the end we're all losers.

478
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:47,550
Yoon Ha.
- Hm?

479
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:53,910
Would I have loved the Director Jerk if he was unemployed and a player?

480
00:38:55,350 --> 00:39:00,630
Because he was a chaebol, his rude behavior towards me in the beginning

481
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:03,150
was charming and I liked him.

482
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:08,090
And that's how I came to love him. That's how it started.

483
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:10,550
Is my love a lie?

484
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:13,870
How can you understand Choi Joon Gi more than you understand me?

485
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:16,190
I think it's because we're of similar backgrounds.

486
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:20,650
Because he's the best in our neighborhood, I want to root for him.

487
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,330
What's the thing you wanted to talk about?

488
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:25,810
I uploaded your picture on my SNS. You said it's okay even if the picture is embarrassing.

489
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:27,090
Is that what you meant? (upload on SNS)

490
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:29,410
Yeah. The reactions are good.

491
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:32,710
The way I look at it, you're a great product.

492
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:36,230
The response will be great if I sell makeup linked with you.

493
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:40,030
Deputy Choi also said the idea was good and that he'd make us a video. Let's do it!

494
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:40,790
What?

495
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:44,410
A picture of you putting on makeup. A commoner and a rich daughter.

496
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:46,890
Even though the identity is different, the makeup is the same.

497
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:49,450
If the makeup gets a lot of sales its good for you, right?

498
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:54,630
It's a good thing. But how could you think of something like that?

499
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:57,430
I want to be at least a little help to you.

500
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:03,030
I don't go close to you at the company because I'm scared that I'll be a burden to you.

501
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:14,230
You're already here.

502
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:19,090
Of course, I should be here early. I have a chance to give a presentation to the Vice President.

503
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:23,410
I like it. Even though I didn't assign it, you found work to do.

504
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:26,530
Starting in November, the people in the department stores get a special cut.

505
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:29,730
Starting in September, Hoo Song department store is planning to come in.

506
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:34,340
The department store revenue will continue to increase.

507
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:38,160
Let's hear more.

508
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:58,190
I received your email. I'll make the video.

509
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:00,210
Thanks.

510
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:02,590
Do you want to eat lunch together?

511
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,610
I have an appointment.

512
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:06,430
Have a good lunch.

513
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,660
I loved that man at one time.

514
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,460
Being able to solve all kinds of problems...

515
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:21,560
There was a time when I was full of ambition.

516
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,370
With the company. Regarding Oppa. Even the future.

517
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:32,170
I found out what love is.

518
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:39,810
As I lost love and will, I became incompetent.

519
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:44,180
The time when I was in a fake love,

520
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:47,840
my inner-self shined the most.

521
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:05,110
Should I get you something to drink?

522
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:07,410
I'm fine.

523
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:10,690
He said he's fine. Go inside, Ahjumma.

524
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:12,530
Alright.

525
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:17,610
I am giving you this on behalf of the Chairwoman.

526
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:37,660
Is she trying to wrap things up with me using this?

527
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:42,960
You can move out within three months... and how's living in the U.S.?

528
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,220
We'll prepare a place for you to live in the U.S.

529
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:52,140
That's nonsense!

530
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:56,380
Why should I leave the country and live abroad? Does the President know, too?

531
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,660
She already told him.

532
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:04,000
He knows... but he didn't even say a word?

533
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,830
We will sell the house, so that it won't be too bothersome for you.

534
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:21,830
Tell her to recalculate again.

535
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:26,430
If I keep sticking around I could receive something better than this.

536
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:30,670
She must take into account that I must live comfortably.

537
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:33,430
Don't give me a house, I'll take care of it myself.

538
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:37,680
If I finish my calculations cleanly, I will take care of myself.

539
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:43,640
Ahjumma! The guest is leaving, you have to see him out.

540
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,470
Where is the President?

541
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:56,910
He's at home.

542
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:59,150
When does he start working at the company?

543
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:01,230
Madam is taking complete care of him.

544
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:03,010
Follow what Madam wants you to do.

545
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:06,960
Secretary Hong... are you going to be like this?

546
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,860
What did I do all this time?

547
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:13,820
I warned you last time.

548
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:19,280
If you make me upset, I won't innocently step down.

549
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,340
I understand.

550
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:36,750
Seriously. I might as well as eat ssam.

551
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:45,390
There must be something if information keeps coming out.

552
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:48,570
Gather everything related to Gyeong Joon

553
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:50,230
and give it to a more skilled company.

554
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:52,130
I understand, President.

555
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:57,390
Drink this. It's aronia juice.

556
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:11,880
I'm getting better professionals working on Gyeong Joon's case.

557
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:15,060
It's not a voluntary disappearance.

558
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:17,040
Why would he do that?

559
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,060
There's nothing that can't happen.

560
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:21,660
Then it's more hopeless.

561
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:26,100
He decided for himself to suddenly disappear. How can you make him appear?

562
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:29,500
I hope it really isn't that.

563
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:33,000
And I took care of Hannam-dong.

564
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,960
Don't do anything else.

565
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,180
I can't promise that.

566
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:40,260
You were pretty much dead, but they saved you.

567
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:41,830
It wasn't serious.

568
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:45,300
You don't know what will happen from now on! We're old now.

569
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,720
You might not be able to lightly pass through it like this next time.

570
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,940
Can't we live our old age peacefully and quietly?

571
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:54,440
I'm not old yet!

572
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,120
I know you're not old.

573
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:59,040
I'll treat you based on your standard.

574
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:03,380
In return, don't step over the line.

575
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,640
Yeah?

576
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,420
What are you doing?

577
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:14,740
Working, what else?

578
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:15,880
Let's go out to eat.

579
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,080
I ate already.

580
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,120
I haven't eaten.

581
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:22,680
Let's eat together. You can't even do that for me?

582
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:25,980
Then do you want to come here?

583
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:29,080
Do you want to eat in the cafeteria here together?

584
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,940
Does it not suit your taste?

585
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:49,800
I don't really have much of an urge to eat lately.

586
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:54,030
You should still pretend to eat. Think of the person eating with you.

587
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,740
What are you going to do after you finish eating?

588
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:34,500
I have to work, of course.

589
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:37,230
How's working at this company?

590
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:40,220
You ask me every time you meet me.

591
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:41,340
I know, right.

592
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:43,920
Do you want to go ride our bikes?

593
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,550
No. If we go right now, I'll lose.

594
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:50,150
I'll lose for you.

595
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:54,970
Forget it. Letting me win is worse than me losing.

596
00:47:57,150 --> 00:47:58,510
I have to go.

597
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:01,070
How can you just leave?

598
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:02,790
Then what should I do?

599
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:05,830
You should carry the tray and put it back, of course.

600
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:11,410
Why did I come here... ?

601
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:16,430
My mom said she wants to see you.

602
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:21,830
When I see your mom, I'm going to tell her everything. You bastard. I'm still mad.

603
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:25,510
I'm sorry.

604
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:28,410
I think I only thought about myself.

605
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:33,110
Do you think I'll forgive you because of that, you bastard.

606
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:34,870
I think I like you better than before.

607
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:37,430
Ah, perverted bastard. I don't like it, so why do you?

608
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:38,790
I don't know.

609
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:42,710
Maybe it's because we were separated, or I changed.

610
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:44,890
I'm going.

611
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:46,970
Should I call Ji Yi for you?

612
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:52,730
You came to meet Ji Yi. Why would you eat cafeteria food?

613
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:56,210
Is she doing well?

614
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:00,370
Then that's fine.

615
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:02,230
Do you have anything for me to help you with?

616
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:06,210
What could you help me with? I have to do it.

617
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:16,730
♫ Please stop coming close to me ♫

618
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:24,550
♫ Because your tears will shake me up again ♫

619
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:32,170
♫ As much as I am pushing you away ♫

620
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:34,790
♫ It may hurt  ♫

621
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:40,930
♫ But I have to hold back from you ♫

622
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:46,810
♫ Tears are spilling out ♫

623
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:50,430
♫ Though I try to push you away ♫

624
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:57,010
♫ And make effort to hold it ♫

625
00:49:57,890 --> 00:49:59,910
Congratulations on your appointment.

626
00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:03,230
Yeah. So what happened with Gyeong Joon?

627
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:06,750
The President began to involve himself with it personally.

628
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:10,250
If he comes back...

629
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:12,750
What happens if it is a voluntary disappearance?

630
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:15,330
The game is already over.

631
00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:18,590
And why would a kid who decided to live another life come back?

632
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:22,730
Won't the President and his wife try to find him no matter what?

633
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:26,260
Whether they find him and drag him back, or he comes back by himself,

634
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:27,730
it will be good.

635
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
He can't come back. He wouldn't have done this if he was going to come back.

636
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:47,090
Mom! My m..

637
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:49,130
Mom!

638
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:51,370
Hey, did you drink again?

639
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:54,370
How much did you drink?

640
00:50:57,110 --> 00:50:59,190
I didn't drink that much.

641
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:21,470
Chang Soo, drink this.

642
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:22,850
No, I don't want to.

643
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:25,190
Drink it.

644
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:40,490
Hey!

645
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:45,910
Hey!

646
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:48,710
Hey!

647
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:51,810
Why are you like this?

648
00:51:58,190 --> 00:51:59,950
Are you okay?

649
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:06,230
Mom... remember.

650
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:09,810
I chose you.

651
00:52:09,810 --> 00:52:13,550
Can you stop talking about that?

652
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:18,190
Mom,

653
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:22,370
do you want me to live like a beggar?

654
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:24,290
Why would you live like a beggar?

655
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:26,450
Why can't I have the thing I want?

656
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:29,990
Have it all. You can have everything.

657
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:32,470
Lee Ji Yi, too?

658
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:34,550
Let me have Lee Ji Yi.

659
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:39,610
Let me have Lee Ji Yi, too.

660
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:44,210
Hey, hey, hey! Don't lie on the floor.

661
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:46,930
Hey, hey, hey! Why are you like this! Get yourself together!

662
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:50,910
Chang Soo, wake up. Son?

663
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:53,550
Are you here?

664
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:57,170
I'm home.

665
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:01,530
Why do you look so tired?

666
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:03,590
I don't want to live.

667
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:20,270
How can you just say that and go upstairs?

668
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:22,130
Say what?

669
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:24,450
That you don't want to live.

670
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:33,530
I said it to make you feel better.

671
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:35,410
What do you mean?

672
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:38,810
You want me to die.

673
00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:40,550
Hey!

674
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,690
I want to die.

675
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:49,190
I want to be dead.

676
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:54,910
Like you said, I shouldn't have been born.

677
00:53:54,910 --> 00:53:57,790
If I wasn't born,

678
00:53:57,790 --> 00:54:01,610
you wouldn't have had to go through all that pain.

679
00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:05,230
I'm the problem.

680
00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:09,170
Like you said, I'm always the problem.

681
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:11,150
Yoon Ha!

682
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:14,650
My life is cursed.

683
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:21,850
Is it asking for too much to want a normal life?

684
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:29,530
Wanting to live being loved... and giving love...

685
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:32,010
is that so wrong?

686
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:38,090
I mean,

687
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:43,850
even my mom who gave birth to me hates me. So who would love me?

688
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:46,330
Why are you like this?

689
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:48,770
Mom,

690
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:56,490
if I love someone, they all leave me.

691
00:54:57,450 --> 00:55:00,250
Oppa died because of me,

692
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:06,890
and the person I loved used to act like he loved me,

693
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:10,690
but says he loves me now.

694
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:14,410
Does that make sense?

695
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:20,670
Mom, I'm sorry.

696
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:23,690
I'm sorry for being born.

697
00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:26,810
Don't do this.

698
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:33,190
It's not like that, don't do this. Did I do this to you?

699
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:35,750
Did I make you like this?

700
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:37,390
Mom,

701
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:40,770
I killed Oppa.

702
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:44,490
You are right.

703
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:46,830
If I went with him then he...

704
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:49,310
Gyeong Joon is not dead.

705
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:52,770
It's not your fault. He's not dead.

706
00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:53,850
He's not dead?

707
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,210
He's not dead.

708
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:56,570
Then where is he?

709
00:55:56,570 --> 00:56:00,470
We're looking for him. So stop being like this.

710
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:02,130
No...

711
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:06,410
Then, I've done something wrong again.

712
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:08,850
I've done something wrong

713
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:10,850
and things are going wrong again.

714
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:14,390
No, it's not. It's not your fault.

715
00:56:14,390 --> 00:56:19,610
It's my fault. It's not your fault. Come to your senses!

716
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:36,790
Mother

717
00:57:43,890 --> 00:57:47,130
Mother, how are you doing?

718
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,510
I need to see you.

719
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:52,430
Should I go to your company?

720
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:11,690
I'm not kind to just anyone.

721
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:15,130
I'm kind to you because you're Jang Yoon Ha.

722
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:27,310
According to this company's resolution, Vice President Jang has voluntarily disappeared.

723
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:30,050
This company's resolution as well.

724
00:58:34,910 --> 00:58:37,590
That is Gyeong Joon.

725
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:40,630
No way! I'm speechless.

726
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:42,090
How far have you tracked him?

727
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:44,570
He has a few residences in Southeast Asia.

728
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:46,330
It seems like he has planned this carefully.

729
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:47,810
Can't we make him come back?

730
00:58:47,810 --> 00:58:51,550
What's the use of having someone like this come back!

731
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:54,490
Honey!

732
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:57,370
President!
- President!

733
00:58:57,370 --> 00:58:58,770
Are you okay?

734
00:58:58,770 --> 00:59:03,150
I'm on my way back from a meeting. Have a chat until I get there.

735
00:59:16,350 --> 00:59:18,230
What are you doing?

736
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:21,430
I'm being your shade.

737
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:24,130
I'm fine. Move.

738
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,470
Did you eat the sandwich well?

739
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:29,510
I ate it.

740
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:32,450
How come you don't say thank you? You have no manners.

741
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:34,210
I don't have manners.

742
00:59:36,370 --> 00:59:38,950
You almost fell!

743
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:42,150
Are you worrying about me?

744
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:47,090
Seriously, why would I worry about you.

745
00:59:47,090 --> 00:59:50,950
Anyway, since it's unsafe walk next to me.

746
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:00,770
Yes, Ahjussi.

747
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:05,850
I'm at the hospital. The President has fallen ill again.

748
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:08,490
Okay, I'll go right over.

749
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:09,230
What happened?

750
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:11,190
Dad has fallen ill again.

751
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:13,650
He's in the hospital.

752
01:00:15,790 --> 01:00:18,450
What are you doing?
- I brought my car to work. I'll give you a ride.

753
01:00:18,450 --> 01:00:20,230
Okay. Let this go.

754
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:21,990
I don't want to.
