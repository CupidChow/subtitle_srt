1
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,680
I know what love is.

2
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,220
Being able to smile during a pathetic situation.

3
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,070
Being able to see the dark reality in bright light.

4
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:02,400
Then you come to like the situation you're facing.

5
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:08,510
Because you come to like it,

6
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,770
love makes you stay in that dark reality.

7
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,910
That's why...the one thing I'm the most cautious of...

8
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,640
You...

9
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,370
are very different.

10
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,810
♫ I’m also pushing you away like this ♫

11
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:33,130
So you don't like that?

12
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,680
I didn't know back then.

13
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,350
That I...had already stepped over that border.

14
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:50,460
♫ Because your warmth will surely shake me up ♫

15
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:58,330

Episode 10

18
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,690
Why are you so late?

19
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,240
I'll tell you the reality between you two.

20
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,970
We wouldn't accept a daughter-in-law like you.

21
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,820
Chang Soo won't marry you.

22
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:44,190
If you really love someone, you'd be willing to step aside for him. How much humiliation do you want to go through before this ends?

23
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,000
Did something happen?

24
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,760
You have to tell me.

25
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:12,370
You cry often. I really hate women who cry.

26
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,550
I'm not crying.

27
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,760
Since you listened to me well, I should give you a reward.

28
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,350
Where are we going?

29
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:31,340
To a place with a good view. You like places like that.

30
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,320
Give me your car key.

31
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,220
I'll drive. I'll drop you off at your house and go home.

32
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:46,400
That's the most efficient way. If you take me home, you have to find a taxi and then go home.

33
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,060
That's inefficient.

34
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,900
You should get in. I'll take you home.

35
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,640
Okay.

36
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,020
There was a place like this in Seoul?

37
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,780
The view is really nice.

38
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,800
I was right, right?

39
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,920
This isn't operated by Korea, which you like, but the city of Seoul.

40
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,280
Then it's free.

41
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,020
It's free.

42
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,760
I like it.

43
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,960
But you are a bit cheap.

44
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,720
What?

45
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,080
You got the streetlamp from the district office. This place is free because it's run by the city.

46
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,520
You conserve a lot of money.

47
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,220
I don't spend my money on useless things.

48
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,640
But there are women lining up because they like me.

49
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,140
I'm very-
- "I'm very full of myself," right?

50
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:45,980
Hey.

51
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,340
You must have been to many places with women.

52
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,860
You even know places like this.

53
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,400
You don't look very diligent, but you actually are.

54
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:02,340
Wow, you are alive now. You were crying a while ago.

55
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,400
Do you want me to tell you who I came here with?

56
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,260
I'm going to go home. My mood is ruined.

57
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,180
From now on I'm not a girl that gets mad and becomes okay easily.

58
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,820
This is my first time coming with you.

59
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,740
It seemed like you like things that don't require money, so I found this place.

60
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:28,700
I was going to take you here when you are feeling down, but I didn't expect us to come here so quickly.

61
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,640
Are you happy?

62
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,500
I am happy.

63
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,880
My leg hurts.

64
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,460
What do you expect me to do?

65
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,400
I didn't ask you to do anything.

66
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,780
I'll piggyback you.

67
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,600
No. You said that my lower body is plump.

68
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:20,310
Now that I think about it, I think it's good for women to have a plump lower body.

69
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,580
Size 26 is the best.

70
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,720
Did something happen today?

71
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,340
Nothing happened.

72
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,020
It's hot.

73
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,620
I'm not going to break up with you.

74
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,880
We are in our twenties.

75
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,040
Why would we connect dating and marriage?

76
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,760
Isn't it hot?

77
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,380
Let's be like this for a moment.

78
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,680
Why are you getting off?

79
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,680
I wanted to look at you face-to-face and say goodbye.

80
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,560
Go home safely. Text me once you get home.

81
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,400
Yes, sir.

82
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,720
Why are you here?

83
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,220
Let's talk for a moment inside.

84
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,800
No. Let's talk somewhere else.

85
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,520
If we are going to walk this much, let's take the car.

86
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,800
Why? You don't want to?

87
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,340
Does the world seem like it's yours now that Taejin Group's daughter drops you off in her car?

88
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,240
We broke up.

89
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,280
It doesn't matter to you whom I date.

90
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,780
I still like you.

91
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,060
I'm sorry.

92
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:50,160
When a man tells a woman to break up, the women should just break up with him, Min Jeong.

93
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,540
I know that the word "let's break up" can mean "hold on to me" to women,

94
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,660
but it's not like that for men.

95
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:59,000
You broke up with me after cheating on me with Taejin Group's daughter, right?

96
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,520
You dug through my family's background.

97
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,580
I never did that. You said it with your own mouth.

98
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:09,120
Your brother, father, and house! You talked a lot about them.

99
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,780
You kept saying how amazing you were, so I just looked up your father's company.

100
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,540
If you call that digging through your background, you can call it that.

101
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,500
Do you love her?

102
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,850
Do you really love her?

103
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,520
Should I take you home? You brought your car, right?

104
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,830
Don't pity me.

105
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,950
The results of the 2nd investigation of Gyeong Joon's itinerary before the accident

106
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:48,010
confirmed the previous results.

107
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:53,100
According to their expertise,

108
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,830
they said that because it's so simple, it's strange.

109
00:10:55,830 --> 00:11:00,150
The last person he spoke with was the President.

110
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Did you cry?

111
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,620
Did you cry after hearing about Gyeong Joon's news?

112
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:24,790
Am I not human? How could I not cry after hearing that happen to my child?

113
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:28,940
No! You didn't cry!

114
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,590
It seems like you won't be able to avoid prosecution.

115
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,580
I got it.

116
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,270
How should I deal with Vice President Song?

117
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,850
Step on them completely.

118
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:53,390
They regret what they've done and keep sending gifts to ask for our forgiveness.

119
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,570
What should I do for it to be good?

120
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,320
Even though they betrayed us, they're reflecting on their mistakes.

121
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,940
Their family also has a lot of fate with our household.

122
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,710
Gyeong Joon.

123
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,250
Yes?

124
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,400
Throw away your heart.

125
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,760
I don't have a heart.

126
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,990
Working together with a good competitor, will only have them hold a knife against my back.

127
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:20,930
I have seen how people who I opened up to changed in front of money.

128
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:24,420
Do you know what you're better off with in life in the end?

129
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:30,000
Money. Girls. Food.

130
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,610
Material possessions are life.

131
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:40,210
If we're human...shouldn't we leave meaning to our lives?

132
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,280
Where's my mom?

133
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,880
She's with Butler Hong.

134
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,140
Why hasn't he left work yet?

135
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,200
Lately, the two have been spending a lot of time together.

136
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,190
What about Yoon Ha?

137
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,380
She's in her room.

He looks like he has a good character.

His family background isn't good.

as well as leadership.

However, their decision on public dating is positive.

What is she doing at the President's Secretary's office?
And with the Public Relations team?

153

Tell them to release an article of our own.

154
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:52,630
That they only met while she worked part-time there. That they're not in any relationship.

Tell Yoon Ha to come. I really don't know why she's like this!

Yes, I understand.

You still haven't gotten off work?

Yes, I'll leave eventually.

00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,700
You should rest. Why did you come?

163
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:27,220
I'm moving here tomorrow. Mom, you don't remember, do you?

164
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,570
I'm sorry. I didn't have the chance.

165
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,290
Do you have some sort of problem?

166
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:34,670
I'm perplexed. About Yoon Ha, too.

167
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,580
Gyeong Joon's case still hasn't been confirmed either.

168
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:42,120
Leave Yoon Ha alone. Getting involved with their young, affectionate relationship will make them become hostile against you.

169
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,140
Furthermore, Yoon Ha's not the type to listen to somebody else.

170
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,970
Still, how could I leave her alone? I'm a parent after all.

171
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:50,010
The girl is about to jump into a fire. How can I leave her alone?

172
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:52,750
Father is gonna make Yoon Ha work at his company.

173
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,240
Receiving her wage while working at the business is alright, too.

174
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,320
Even if she were to meet with someone similar and live together with them, there are a lot of problems in marriage.

175
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,860
Do you think it's easy to get a divorce just because you say it?

176
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,150
Getting a divorce isn't difficult.

177
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,830
For people like us, how would a divorce become a problem?

178
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:10,310
Getting drained while being tied down from marriage and ruining your life would be the bigger problem.

179
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,280
You don't think a divorce is a big deal?

180
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,800
Of course, it's not just nothing.

181
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,020
Because I've been preparing, there wasn't much damage.

182
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,290
Our children's father had an affair.

183
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:24,200
Without him knowing, I gathered evidence and turned it all in.

184
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,020
He had nothing to say.
-Prepare?

185
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,000
For example, let's say you'll get a divorce.

186
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,840
Dad always had another women.

187
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,980
And after some time, he started another life with her. A mistress.

188
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:41,480
If you gather that kind of evidence, it's a strong advantage.

189
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,160
A divorce suit is all about fighting for money.

190
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,200
It's about who will take more money.

191
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,320
You're astute. I don't ever have to worry about you.

192
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,050
That's why you should leave everything to me.

193
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,330
After all, I'm the eldest daughter.

194
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,040
As I lived life, the fun thing was...

195
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,790
being good can be more harmful than being bad.

196
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,750
What does that mean?

197
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,180
All good actions don't turn into good results.

198
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,270
Ah...this is hard.

199
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:31,990
But in the end, human life is headed to a good direction;

200
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:34,790
In the end, being kind will let you succeed in everything.

201
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:37,860
What to do? I'm not kind.

202
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,180
An eye for an eye; a tooth for a tooth.

203
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,250
You're back?

204
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,620
Yeah, Mom.

205
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:17,830
I was going to call, but I held it in. I was on my way out now.

206
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,750
Were you with Yoon Ha?
-Yeah.

207
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:25,350
Is Yoon Ha really the daughter of Taejin Group?

208
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,750
Yes.

209
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,590
Right now, I'm busy receiving greetings from my friends.

210
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,070
What are you going to do? You must be surprised.

211
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:52,000
When did you know? You didn't know a while ago. Did you also find out from reading the article?

212
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,770
No, she told me in advance.

213
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:58,490
Then that's a relief. I thought you found out today, so I was worried.

214
00:18:58,490 --> 00:18:59,520
Why were you worried?

215
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,560
You'd be hurt.

216
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,840
Why would I be hurt?

217
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,400
That kind of household, to you...

218
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,750
No, even though you don't lack anything, for us...

219
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,170
What's wrong with us?

220
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:13,890
We're a bit...you know.

221
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:17,950
We don't have the requirements that that kind of household would like.

222
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,570
Who was the one who said a person's character is important?
- Me.

223
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:28,150
Who was the one who said one doesn't calculate a person?

224
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,130
Me.

225
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:32,590
Why can you stand by that when you're the one in power but not when you're the disadvantaged?

226
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:35,310
That's why sat I don't like poverty. Why are you intimidated?

227
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:38,350
"Because the personality is important,

228
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:41,950
we aren't inferior even to a chaebeol!"

229
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,960
You have to be like this.

230
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,150
I'm sorry.

231
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,750
I won't be hurt from this matter, so don't worry.

232
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,090
I got it.

233
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,810
I'm going to go home now.

234
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:01,690
I'll take you.
-No!

235
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:03,550
Listen to me.

236
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,580
Did you not hear me asking you to come?

237
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,580
I heard.

238
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,800
Come here and sit down.

239
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,110
End it with the man you're dating right now.

240
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,460
End it while I'm being nice.

241
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,760
I'm saying this for the good of your life.

242
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,940
Everything is complicated for me right now. Don't make it more complicated.

243
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,820
Father approved of it.

244
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:50,700
Do you think that's because he approves of you two?

245
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,600
He's just using you briefly as a marketing strategy!

246
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,360
Even if he's using me as a marketing strategy or whatever, the fact that he approved is more important.

247
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,430
Are you saying your father's words are the heavens and my words are something you can step on?

248
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:04,990
I am saying that I will only respect words I want to hear.

249
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:05,750
What?

250
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,990
I told you before. I'm going to marry who I want.

251
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:11,790
I also told you before. You can't.

252
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,880
I live my own life.

253
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,220
I have lived that life! The outcome is so obvious!

254
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,560
Even if you marry and live with a man with an ordinary household,

255
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,620
it's difficult. Ye Won got a divorce!

256
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,950
Because it was matched with the same class.

257
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:29,040
Marriage is done with the person you love.

258
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,250
I really like that man.

259
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:36,990
Even if I had nothing, back then he liked me.

260
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,870
Where could I find another man like him?

261
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:42,950
Have you checked? That he liked you without knowing whose household you're the daughter of?

262
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:45,730
Don't insult him.

263
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,080
You've gone crazy.

264
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,640
Yes. I'm crazy.

265
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,400
So don't stop me.

266
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:00,660
Let's only make our own lives unfortunate.

267
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:05,780
Don't go to the point where you drag someone else into your misfortune.

268
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,670
Can't you come in for a bit and leave later?

269
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:32,870
Your dad really misses you.

270
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:35,870
Can't you let him see your face?

271
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:40,550
Next time. I'm a bit tired today, Mom.

272
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:43,850
Alright. You must feel tired.

273
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:45,350
Go then.

274
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:48,670
You said you are going to visit Joong Hyun next week, right?

275
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:55,130
It's okay, Mom has money. For you, it's important, just keep it.

276
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:57,110
Go.

277
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:19,520
Isn't this Joon Gi's graduation?

278
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,420
You're back?
-Yeah.

279
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,640
Something big happened, Honey.

280
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,790
What?

281
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:40,110
I told you about the girl that Joon Gi is dating, right?

282
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,830
The girl who works at the supermarket.

283
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:44,650
She's not a part-timer at the supermarket.

284
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:48,110
She's the daughter of the President of Taejin Group.

285
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,380
No way!

286
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:54,500
No, it's true. I've confirmed with Joon Gi as well.

287
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,360
You met Joon Gi?

288
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,880
Yeah. He brought me home and left.

289
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,580
Why did he just leave if he came all the way to the front of our house?

290
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:07,300
He must be tired. We have to understand him.

291
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,980
Of course, we should try to understand him.

292
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:17,200
What is our son going to do? The two like each other so much.

293
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,470
No matter what, Yoon Ha's household isn't going to accept our Joon Gi, huh?

294
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:26,010
Why are they making such a big deal out of class difference when the two like each other?

295
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:31,150
Saying that there's just a difference is embarrassing.

296
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,310
That's true.

297
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:39,230
Let's have a drink today.

298
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:42,610
Yeah, let's do it.

299
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,100
You're late.

300
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,020
Yeah.

301
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,360
I have something to say to you.

302
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,320
Come up.

303
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:13,850
Today, I met the part-timer you're dating.

304
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,410
You didn't hear from her?

305
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:25,220
I didn't. She has a name. Her name is Lee Ji Yi.

306
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,780
Alright. Lee Ji Yi.

307
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:31,020
I almost fell for her.

308
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:37,880
She has charms. She has self esteem, too. She's cute and energetic.

309
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,340
Get to the point.

310
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:44,750
I understand why you like her. That's why this won't do. I won't stop you from liking her.

311
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:48,910
But your actions are changing right now.

312
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:54,390
You're straying outside of the pattern you had with the girls you've dated until now.

313
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,330
So?

314
00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:02,850
That kind of kid...a kid who's in such a low class...I can't accept her as a daughter-in-law.

315
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:04,380
I know.

316
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:10,720
While I'm at it, I've decided not to give you the hotel stocks we talked about.

317
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:18,160
I got it. You're so cheap.

318
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,150
I'm sorry.

319
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,420
I'm going to talk to dad again.

320
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:23,160
There's no use. I told him already.

321
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,340
We're done talking.

322
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,020
Why are you so sensitive about Ji Yi?

323
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:32,190
Let's say it's mother's intuition. This is both a warning and the beginning that it's not going to happen.

324
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:35,700
I know you. You can't live without money.

325
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,060
You can't live without this kind of background either.

326
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,540
So give up on Lee Ji Yi.

327
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:45,420
If you can't, then meet her secretly so I don't notice.

328
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:48,700
Or...I'll meet Lee Ji Yi again.

329
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,580
Mom!

330
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:53,800
I don't want the relationship between you two to be bad.

331
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,660
THAT is the reason I am going to bother her.

332
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:06,060
I understand. I'm going to wash up so leave.

333
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:16,660
Ah, one more thing. I told Joon Gi to come tomorrow morning before he goes to work.

334
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,520
Why him?

335
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,260
To fire him. She's the girl you were supposed to have an arranged marriage with.

336
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,760
You didn't know about Joon Gi and Yoon Ha dating.

337
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,980
It's a backstab.

338
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:27,120
Are you really going to be like this?

339
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,740
Am I a preschooler?
Why are you interfering with my work?

340
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:35,140
Since my marriage will involve you, I'm holding back whenever you say anything about Ji Yi.

341
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,340
But this isn't it.

342
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,800
Even so, why are you so mad?

343
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:42,660
Why wouldn't I? Why do you make a person so laughable?

344
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,430
Will you be happy making me look like a person who couldn't judge a person's character and got backstabbed?

345
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:53,610
I'll decide whether I get backstabbed or face someone head on. Not you.

346
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:58,730
I got it. I went too far.

347
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:16,170
I won't break up with you.

348
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:24,290
We're in our 20's.
Why do you keep associating dating with marriage?

349
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:31,140
I know why you're mad.

350
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:36,590
Because your prospects could be mine, too.

351
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:39,760
That's why I'm not telling you, because I know you.

352
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:45,660
I accepted this kind of action from you. You're childish, just as I thought.

353
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,520
Bastard.

354
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:23,210
From: Jerk Director

355
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:27,250
Sleep well.

356
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:36,220
♫ If you're going to hurt me, why did you come?
The hunch of whether you might not come ♫

357
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:42,750
♫ Or you might come ♫

358
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:48,890
♫ I miss you a bit more ♫

359
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:52,650
♫ What should I do? ♫

360
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:57,010
Sleep well. I really enjoyed today.

361
00:29:57,010 --> 00:30:06,370
♫ A day without you is difficult ♫

362
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:15,970
♫ All day, it feels like my heart is aching to death ♫

363
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:20,630
Eldest sister.

364
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:22,830
You come here often.

365
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:25,350
Did you hide something here?

366
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:29,730
No. It's your space now.

367
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,710
I came here often because of our brother.

368
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,060
I came because I don't think I can come often anymore.

369
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:39,170
Why can't you come often? Come often. I'll fill in the empty spot that Gyeong Joon left.

370
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,180
Do you not like me?

371
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,360
No, that's not it.

372
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,030
I thought there was something up when you said you were too busy to meet up. So you were dating, huh.

373
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,180
Yeah.

374
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,780
If you are dating someone, you should come to me for advice and talk to me.

375
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,020
Must I hear about your relationship through the news?

376
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:59,240
It just happened like that in several hours.
-You're not going to introduce him to me?

377
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,960
I will.
-I was just asking.

378
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,400
He's not even someone you're going to marry. He's someone you're just dating so why would he have to see me, too?

379
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,090
You're going to end up with an arranged marriage in the end anyways.

380
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:15,300
No. I've already told mom and dad.

381
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:20,120
I'm going to marry the way I want to. With the person I love.

382
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,200
Then you're going to marry that man?

383
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,410
I want to but I don't know if he does.

384
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:29,960
It's hard. He's not an easy person.

385
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,430
I was also the one who asked him out first.

386
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:36,270
I see.

387
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:38,910
But Unni...

388
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:43,890
Is the scandal with Taejin Cosmetics over yet?

389
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:52,720
There are countless lawsuits against each company so I'm not exactly sure which one you are talking about.

390
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:03,590
The cosmetics for children.

391
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,810
I don't know.

392
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:14,070
When I was around, that project continued, but it's probably over now. Why?

393
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,930
How did you know about that?

394
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:20,000
Gyeong Joon told me.
-Gyeong Joon?

395
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,900
He told you that kind of stuff, too?
- Yeah.

396
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:28,910
You two were a lot closer than I thought.

397
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,990
He...

398
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:35,130
said that people's lives are going in a good direction.

399
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:39,660
He said that being kind will help you succeed everything in the end.

400
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:43,480
Sounds like something he would say.
-You're right, Unni.

401
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,900
That's why I told him this at that time.

402
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:50,120
An eye for an eye;

403
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,500
a tooth for a tooth.

404
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,390
That matches me.

405
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:01,630
You're going to lead Taejin Group now, aren't you?

406
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:03,940
I don't know about that. There's you and So Hyeon, too, after all.

407
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:07,120
I don't have any interest in the company.

408
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,210
But you...

409
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:11,880
You've been starting to be a problem lately.

410
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:16,900
You're going to start work next week even though you say you have no interest in the company and that you'll never come to the company.

411
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,040
Your words and actions are completely different.
- I have a situation for that.

412
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,720
Everyone has a situation, but you still have to stick to what you say.

413
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,540
I welcome you to the company. But one part of me is worried.

414
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:34,300
I am worried that you, who has no real work experience, will just take up the manager position and become a nuisance to those under you.

415
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:37,370
Yoon Ha.

416
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:40,970
I'm moving in now.

417
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:43,750
We three sisters should have a drink then.

418
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,350
Okay.

419
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,720
I have something to tell you.

420
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,260
Okay.

421
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,360
Stay here as long as you want.

422
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,180
Starting tomorrow, you won't be able to come here freely like you used to.

423
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,260
Okay, Unni.

424
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:14,740
Team Leader Jang Yoon Ha and Choi Joon Gi have come to the company.

425
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,960
They went to see Yoon Ha's office and left.

426
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,200
Make an appointment with Choi Joon Gi. I have to see what kind of person he is.

427
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,010
Okay.

428
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:34,330
Unni.

429
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:40,340
Oppa, did our eldest sister do this?

430
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:46,230
He told you that kind of stuff, too? You guys were a lot closer than I thought.

431
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,410
Hello?

432
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:03,110
I'm Choi Joon Gi's ex-girlfriend.

433
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:05,010
I have something to tell you.

434
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:07,260
Let's meet.

435
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,280
But why do you want to meet me?

436
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:16,350
To tell you what kind of person Choi Joon Gi is.

437
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:18,590
I only believe what I see.

438
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:22,370
I don't know what you're going to say, but I won't meet you.

439
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:26,810
Besides what you see, don't you want to know more?

440
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:45,030
Come quickly.
- Yes.

441
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:47,850
Sit down and wait. Chang Soo will come down.

442
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,410
Should I get you anything?

443
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:53,070
No, Mother. Tell me what you want to say.

444
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:55,840
Ah, what I have to say...

445
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,490
I forgot all of that.

446
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,980
Ah, he has come down.

447
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,790
Let's go.

448
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,830
Go?
- Go to work together.

449
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:09,500
You should eat something and then go.

450
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,160
You ate, right?

451
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,910
Yeah, I did.

452
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:15,010
We'll just go.

453
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:28,710
I recently became a pushover because of you.

454
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,980
No matter how I think of it, I was sincere towards you.

455
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:35,090
But you used me?

456
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:39,340
Let's have a cycling race. It's been a long time.

457
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:47,550
What's the occasion? It's so early in the morning.

458
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:50,870
Your maid isn't here yet, right?

459
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:56,290
Her work hours have not started yet. Why? Do you have business with her?

460
00:36:56,290 --> 00:37:01,660
I'm just saying just in case it will become a problem in the future but watch out for your maid.

461
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:05,200
Why?
- That would be good for you.

462
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:11,790
Is this the President's command?
- No. I came here before he could order me to.

463
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:15,800
Do you secretly watch over me, too? Who are you to tell me to fire my worker or not?

464
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,360
Even if the President were to tell me to fire her, I won't.

465
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,200
That's not it.
- Stop telling me this and that.

466
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,860
Does it look like I'm staying still just because you told me to?!
It's not like that, please be calm.

467
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,920
Ahjumma's here.

468
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,740
Then I'll be leaving.

469
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:46,140
I'm here.

470
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,540
Ahjumma.

471
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,730
Give me a glass of iced Americano.

472
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:53,590
In the morning?
- Yes, in the morning.

473
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,610
In the daytime.

474
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,650
[Chang Soo's mother]
Ah, what do I do now?

475
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:11,810
I don't want to answer.

476
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:24,630
Hello, Mother.

477
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:26,400
Let's meet for a bit today.

478
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:31,910
Okay.

479
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,020
Lee Min Jung?

480
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,830
Sit.

481
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:55,040
You're a lot prettier than the photo in the article.

482
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,100
Thank you.

483
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:01,050
Actually...I saw you in real life yesterday.

484
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:06,100
I waited for Joon Gi in front of his apartment.

485
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,150
I'll just tell you what I'm here for.

486
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:12,420
I also didn't know I'd be the one in this pathetic position.

487
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,700
When Joon Gi asked to break up, did you guys part on bad terms?

488
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:18,640
If you're thinking of marriage, think well.

489
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:23,240
He's a man who uses women to save his own household.

490
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,750
His household really has no money.

491
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:29,280
My parents found out and opposed us.

492
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,730
But I still said I would.

493
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:37,090
You still like him?

494
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:39,840
You still want to meet him, don't you?

495
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,350
If I break up with him, you're going to go out with him again, aren't you?

496
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:45,830
Since we're both girls,

497
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:50,340
I'm giving you advice.
- I reject your advice.

498
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:55,230
I understand why Joon Gi broke up with you now.

499
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:59,030
Even if you break up, he was a man you once loved...

500
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,730
Do you really want to be saying these things?

501
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:06,040
I met Joon Gi's parents. I like how his parents have a good conjugal harmony.

502
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,940
I like that.

503
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,600
Anyways, thank you for your advice.

504
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,890
Finding somebody else's phone number and calling them...

505
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:16,990
is uncomfortable.

506
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,350
Why are people like this?

507
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:33,340
Why do they always suspect an innocent love?

508
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:37,700
I know, right. Why do they make such a big fuss?

509
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:40,820
I was going to go buy clothes today but I guess I can't go today again.

510
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:45,220
What are you going to do?

511
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:49,850
Meeting once is good enough. Why is she asking to meet again?

512
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,500
Is Chang Soo's mother scary?

513
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,840
She's extremely scary, her eyes are like huge marbles.

514
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:03,120
What are you going to do? Joon Gi's mother is so nice.

515
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:07,020
Do you really have to rub it in at a time like this?

516
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,510
Hey! It's time for you to go now! I'm also going to meet Joon Gi's mother.

517
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,390
Oh, it is.

518
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,950
Ah, they're both mothers but the difference is just too much.

519
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:22,520
I have to get my head on straight.

520
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:29,190
You, too!

521
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:32,420
Hey! Let's talk on the phone later.

522
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:46,860
Let's try it properly once.

523
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:52,280
One...two...go.

524
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:08,860
♫ Back beat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out ♫

525
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:13,950
♫ I'm sure you've heard it all before. But you never really had a doubt ♫

526
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:21,220
♫ I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now ♫

527
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:30,610
♫ And all the lights that lead us there are blinding ♫

528
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:38,320
♫ There are many things I'd like to say to you, but I don't know how ♫

529
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:50,960
♫ Because maybe you're gonna be the one that saves me ♫

530
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:57,140
♫ And after all ♫

531
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,260
Are you in a bad mood because you lost?

532
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,320
I don't feel good about it.

533
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:11,110
I lost almost every time.

534
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:16,280
Because you have to win. Especially against me.

535
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:23,030
I like you.

536
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:25,210
Are you having mercy on me?

537
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:30,970
What I want is to be second-in-command. To me...

538
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:34,740
I can't become first-in-command due to an inherent limit.

539
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,570
So I chose you.

540
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:37,930
Because you needed me?

541
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:41,050
Yeah. Because I needed you.

542
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:46,180
Helping me at that time...did you plan that with the group?

543
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:49,330
You were truly receiving hate from those guys.

544
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:51,340
That became an opportunity to me.

545
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:55,370
I thought you were a pretty good person, but...

546
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:59,720
you were just a cheap person who clings onto powerful people to benefit from them.

547
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,950
In societal terms, it's called building up connections.

548
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:05,310
You attend meetings for third generation chaebols.

549
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:08,510
You even attend meetings for young directors. It's the same thing.

550
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:11,190
But when I do it, it's called cheap.

551
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,480
When you do it, it's called management lessons.

552
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:17,520
Chang Soo, I admit and know you're an innocent person.

553
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:22,170
I know you're different from other rich people. That's why you became friends with me.

554
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:25,290
I'm also like that. That's why I came under you.

555
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:28,370
I said we should go together.

556
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,620
I even said that you were family.

557
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,460
Do you know how big of a betrayal I felt because of you?

558
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:40,010
You think that you can obtain people's hearts if you want it because you have a sense of elitism.

559
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:44,020
You can't have my heart.

560
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:48,060
I can't accept your elitism.

561
00:44:55,410 --> 00:45:00,060
You can't overcome yourself. You won't be able to marry Lee Ji Yi.

562
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:02,950
It's not because your household opposes or because someone is stopping you.

563
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:06,180
It's because you, yourself, can't allow it.

564
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:08,790
Your elitism...

565
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:11,170
You will never be able to overcome it.

566
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:18,760
You don't know me.

567
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:22,300
If I make a decision, I can change.

568
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:30,300
If you want to change your values, you first have to overcome yourself and other people.

569
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:33,720
If you overcome other people but can't overcome yourself,

570
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,830
you have to forever live in your belittlement.

571
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:38,790
Why are you so full of yourself?

572
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:42,510
People from here and there will come after me. If it's someone that can offer me benefits,

573
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:46,300
I will hold anyone's hand. Of course, if you extend your hand to me...

574
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,700
I will hold your hand. But...

575
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:52,120
after you prove that you are a strong individual.

576
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:55,270
Joon Gi...
- I saw my dad's life.

577
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,320
He has a good personality. Although he didn't attend school for long, he's smart.

578
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:07,980
I love my family. My mom. My dad.

579
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:12,050
My sibling, Joon Yang. These three people...

580
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:16,780
If I leave them alone, they won't be able to break away from their poor life forever. Then...

581
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:20,840
they'll think they're happy and live that way.

582
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:24,590
I dislike that.

583
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:33,850
Without knowing anything, sincerely...

584
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:36,770
What does that make of Yoon Ha who loves you?

585
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:46,560
I figured this out. Just because my motives were dishonest, it doesn't mean that the process is dishonest as well.

586
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,860
I love Yoon Ha.

587
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:58,840
I revealed everything. Like you wanted, I revealed everything.

588
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,690
Are you happy now?

589
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:38,490
I ordered this in advance. So that you can conserve time.

590
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:50,360
I wanted to drink something else today.

591
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:53,020
I'll drink this because of your thoughtfulness, though.

592
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,890
There were stocks that were going to be given to Chang Soo.

593
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:08,480
I've decided not to give it to him because he's dating you.

594
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:15,340
If he keeps dating you,

595
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:18,650
he will even have everything he owns right now taken away from him.

596
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,230
Yeah, Mom?

597
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:39,510
I'm on my way back from meeting up with Lee Ji Yi.

598
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:43,440
She will probably suffer less if you stop dating her.

599
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:29,410
What?

600
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:33,040
Why are you in a bad mood?

601
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:36,260
Did something happen?

602
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:40,020
Nothing happened.

603
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,860
I have to go buy clothes now.

604
00:49:45,770 --> 00:49:48,770
You still haven't bought those clothes?

605
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:51,670
I don't think I'll be able to buy them today either.

606
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,290
Let's meet up. I have something to say.

607
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:27,690
Why are we meeting in this kind of place?

608
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:32,590
To tell you quickly and then leave.

609
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:36,550
What is it?

610
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:42,290
Let's break up.

611
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:51,930
I tried not to, but we must break up.

612
00:50:56,010 --> 00:50:57,890
I'm sorry.

613
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:02,350
Your mother is too scary.

614
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:06,120
I can endure it if she only says things to me,

615
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:10,020
but because of me, your future...
- Okay.

616
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:14,000
Let's break up.

617
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:31,330
Go.

618
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:35,650
You go first.

619
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:57,780
You go first, quickly!

620
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:00,580
I told you to go first!

621
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:38,670
Do we have to break up today?

622
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:44,370
That's right... It's raining.

623
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:48,170
Shouldn't we avoid the rain?

624
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:54,820
I don't think we should break up on a rainy day.

625
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:59,520
Me, too.

626
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:13,060
♫  Rose was born.  ♫

627
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:18,680
♫  Child actor-ess ♫

628

♫  On the fifth day of the snow  ♫

629
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:29,840
♫  Be good or be gone. ♫

630
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:35,820
♫  Be good or be gone.  ♫

631
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:55,130
I'll do it.

632
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:14,000
Let's not break up today. The weather isn't nice.

633
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,940
The weather isn't nice.

634
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:37,890
♫ Please stop coming close to me,  ♫

635
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:45,630
♫ Because your warmth will surely shake me up ♫

636
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:53,370
♫ As much as I am holding back from you ♫

637
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:55,950
♫ It may hurt  ♫

638
00:54:55,950 --> 00:55:02,750
♫  but I have to hold back from you ♫

639
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:05,930
Do you want to be with me today?

640
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,440
Were you well?
- Yes. Sit down.

641
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,960
Mother.

642
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,140
It's a yellow rose!

643
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:36,000
The meaning behind the flower isn't good, but I don't believe in that.

644
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,680
I think the yellow rose is the prettiest rose.

645
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:41,500
It's really pretty and bright. I should put it in a vase.

646
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,600
I gave it to you. You should take it.

647
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:46,400
I can give this to Joon Gi.

648
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:51,820
Okay. It's nice to see a flower after a long time. I'll take them.

649
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:53,560
Okay.

650
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:58,500
Why didn't you tell me?

651
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:02,760
It's burdensome.

652
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:08,540
But how did you grow up so well, without showing signs of your wealth?

653
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:12,780
Did I grow up well?

654
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:17,160
You grew up well. Thank you.

655
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:22,240
One out of ten reason why I began to like Joon Gi was because of you.

656
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,300
That's not right.

657
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:25,440
Is it too little?

658
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:29,580
No. You should like my son for all the ten reasons.

659
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:33,140
I am already loved by my husband.

660
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,260
Okay.

661
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:38,960
I've never seen a woman that Joon Gi liked this much.

662
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,580
It's the same for me as well.

663
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:46,350
You look very similar to when you were little.

664
00:56:46,350 --> 00:56:50,390
How do you know how I looked like when I was little?

665
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:52,870
I saw it.

666
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:54,170
How?

667
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:57,050
Joon Gi had a photo.

668
00:56:57,050 --> 00:56:58,730
A picture of me when I was little?

669
00:56:58,730 --> 00:57:01,210
Yeah. Do you want me to show it to you?

670
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:03,770
Yes, show it to me.

671
00:57:09,870 --> 00:57:12,110
Joon Gi, where are you?

672
00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:13,730
I'm in the parking lot.

673
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:15,670
I'm with your mother right now.

674
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:17,830
I know. I'll go up now.

675
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:24,270
Isn't this you?

676
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:31,690
That's right.

677
00:57:33,890 --> 00:57:36,170
Twentieth Anniversary

678
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,220
Is that yours as well?

679
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:47,460
Yes.

680
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:51,220
You must have been here often, without me realizing it.

681
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:56,320
No, Mother.

682
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:00,640
Why are you so blanked out?

683
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,700
No, Mother.

684
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:09,080
My thoughts are mixing up in my head.

685
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:12,060
I don't think so... Why are you like that?

686
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:19,080
Mother, I can leave first, right? Something urgent came up.

687
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:20,860
Okay.

688
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:25,900
I can take this, right?

689
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:29,320
You can take it. It's yours.

690
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:30,940
Okay.

691
00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:53,970
Why are you outside?
