1
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:46,630
What is it?

2
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,590
I woke up early.

3
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,740
Aren't you just excited about the remodeling opening?

4
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,130
I'm not someone who's crazy over work, you know.

5
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,160
Try to beat me today.

6
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,340
Why are you bothering me at my home when you have a nice one of your own?

7
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,910
I was about to go morning exercising, but I thought about you and changed my direction.

8
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,480
Do I have to explain these things to you?

9
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,110
It's not that, is it? You have something going on.

10
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,030
About Lee Ji Yi,

11
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,330
can't you promote her a little? Even if it's just a temporary position?

12
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,210
It's better if you make her a full-time employee.
- I told you to stop.

13
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,390
Cosmopolitan. I'm concerned for humankind, that's all.

14
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,020
It's dangerous for a girl to live on a rooftop house alone.

15
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,970
If you're concerned about humankind, just donate. Instead of ruining your life.

16
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,850
But don't I have more rights in hiring and firing employees? More so than you?

17
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:54,970
Temporary and part-time employees are employed through the service department. Do you even know what you're talking about?

18
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,580
Even if we're close,

19
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,870
let's respect each other.

20
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,510
High Society
Episode 4

21
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,670
Hey, Deputy Choi!

22
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,080
I heard one of your part-time employees created a problem.

23
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,960
Why do you even have to deal with things like that? You should just leave it to the managers.

24
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,190
I'll deal with it on my own.

25
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,430
Introduce me to the director, too. Don't be the only one succeeding.

26
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,240
You only get to work when you have support anyway.

27
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,700
There's nobody more comfortable than your colleagues.

28
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,620
There's nobody who can be the strongest competitor than your colleagues.

29
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:50,240
Deputy Sung, let's focus on our duties. Don't think about useless stuff.

30
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,290
Do you know what people say about you behind your back?

31
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,010
Whatever I do, there are always people who talk behind my back.

32
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:04,790
They are people who will talk about other people until they die.

33
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:08,490
Do you think you'll be successful forever? A hound gets eaten after it finishes its hunt.

34
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,850
Even if he gets eaten afterwards, he liked it when he hunted.

35
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,910
It's better to have a time he liked.

36
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,640
Let's work hard today as well.

37
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,010
That jerk.

38
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,920
Pack me two lunches today.

39
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,980
With food that is expensive and tasty, but looks simple.

40
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,990
That's a difficult order. Okay, I got it.

41
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,690
Thank you.

42
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:38,790
You know we're going on vacation tomorrow, right?
- I know. I'll ask for a vacation today.

43
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,760
Do you really have to take her with you?

44
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,250
What's today's menu?

45
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,870
Hello.

46
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,430
What's this, what's this, what's this... oh?

47
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,670
You live your life really well. You pick the right connections.

48
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,690
Thank you.

49
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,820
What is this? Is she taking it as a compliment?

50
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,880
I was insulting her for sure.

51
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,280
Where were you?

52
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,090
Choi Joon Ki's office. I gave him a lunchbox just like yours.

53
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:40,280
Ahhhh, why I am acting so dull?

54
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,930
I always thought it was corny when I saw you bringing sandwiches for someone.

55
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,780
But I'm doing the same.

56
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,140
This puts me in a bad mood.
- Why?

57
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:54,330
How could you pack the same thing for me and him? I should be above him so far.

58
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,330
I want to confess to him.
- What?

59
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:04,280
I'm not coming for two weeks from tomorrow. If it's not today, I'll have to suffer for two weeks.

60
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:09,090
You're so quick to act. I never knew you could do that.

61
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,210
I'm good at choosing and focusing.

62
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:15,720
I have a high concentration for choosing.

63
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,920
Choosing and focusing are good.

64
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,890
But what are you going to do if you get rejected? Why don't you do it after you get to know him better?

65
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:28,400
Well, I'm okay with getting rejected.

66
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,150
I've been rejected several times, so I'm immune to it.

67
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,780
I've been rejected a lot, too, so I know.

68
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:39,120
It hurts whenever you get rejected.

69
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,600
I was trying to act strong. What am I going to do if I get rejected?

70
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,810
Check the preparation for today's opening for remodeling.
- Yes, sir.

71
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,440
Follow up on Chef Raymond Kim.
- Okay.

72
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,650
What is this?

73
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:03,610
[You said] it was goodwill you'd do for anyone, but it was special to me. Thank you.

74
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,570
What are you looking at?

75
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,030
"Passionate Chef 'Raymon Kim,' One Day Cooking Demonstration"
"Raymon Kim's Soul Food: Father's Kimchi Rice Soup"
When you are handling garlic, take out the center of it.

76
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,150
Oh.

77
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:16,710
The reason why you take out the center is because the sprout grows from this area.

78
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,960
Garlic with good sprouts are the best ones to use.

79
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,130
And especially when you make a broth out of anchovies,

80
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:25,500
during the time when bubbles start to form, which is about 70°C,

81
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,380
put in a few small ones. Cutting most of your ingredients before you start cooking

82
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,520
is a good tip to let you cook all at once without stopping.

83
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,780
Any kind of kimchi is good, but the older the kimchi is,

84
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,810
the more interesting it will be.

85
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:44,800
Actually, when I was young, my father always gave it to me after he washed it.

86
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:51,700
The difference between frying the rice and making it into a porridge is making the rice into a more soupy texture, so don't cook it for too long.

87
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,920
It's done.
- Woah!
- It looks so good!

88
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,760
If you have sesame oil, you can use that. But most of you use perilla oil, right?

89
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,940
You can just use a small drop of perilla oil and mix it.

90
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:07,910
I made it spicy on purpose. I know elders like to eat it spicier.

91
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:08,930
So well done!

92
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,800
Try some.

93
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,630
Hello.
- Yes.

94
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,040
Lee Ji Yi, see me for a moment.

95
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:35,790
I called you to hear your future plans.

96
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:42,010
First, I want to become a contract employee. They said if I work hard for six months, they'll raise my position.

97
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:46,020
Do you want me to speed that process up for you?

98
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,860
Why?
- I received a request.

99
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:53,680
But I think that your opinion comes before the request.

100
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:59,320
I can become a temporary worker with my own power.

101
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,020
Do it with your effort. That's a good attitude.

102
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,480
Yes, thank you for worrying about me.

103
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,720
Hey. You know that director jerk's phone number, right?

104
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,820
Yes, I know it.
- Give it to me.

105
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,540
What does he think of me?

106
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,840
Is this rooftop after school? Why call me somewhere like this?
(Korean students call each other to rooftop to have private talk)

107
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,510
How much can you raise me up?

108
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:42,000
Why would I raise you?
- I'm asking how far of a position can you make me into.

109
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:48,220
You know, even if I want to do something, and someone asked me to do it,

110
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:51,240
I no longer want to do it.

111
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:55,690
And so, lend me some money.

112
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:59,220
What do you mean "and so, lend me some money"?
Just what is "and so" about this?

113
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,110
When people ask you to do it, you no longer want to do it.
So, lend me some money.

114
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:07,280
Why this... You should study Korean again. What does that have to do with this?

115
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,230
It will put you off.

116
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,830
You probably don't have any deep affections for me,
but I'm doing this so that you'd be put off.

117
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:17,650
I... don't think anything in this world is free.

118
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,520
Same here.
- Then why did you do that to me?

119
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,360
When Deputy Choi was offering the temporary employee position to me, I really wanted to take it.

120
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,930
I learned that nothing is free in this world, but I wanted to take it.

121
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:31,390
You can take that type of thing.

122
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:34,550
Are you going to take responsibility of me forever?
- Don't do that, it's scaring me.

123
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,020
You have an ability to be scary without drinking alcohol, don't you?

124
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,010
I really don't date anyone I know I'm going to breakup with.

125
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,230
Did I ask you to date me?
- You were going to!

126
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,430
I won't do it!

127
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,790
You won't do it? Why not?

128
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:52,060
Because I'm not going to connect dating and marrying.

129
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,940
I wanted to help you because you were living so brightly.

130
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:01,330
I would've done that for anyone besides you.

131
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,430
Help that you can give to anyone,

132
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:10,450
do it when you're unattractive, old and ill.

133
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,040
Why?

134
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,250
Because it makes my heart flutter.

135
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:27,450
Anyway, thank you for worrying. I'll be going then.

136
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,100
Wow. Is she really messing with my feelings?

137
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,030
Oh yeah, I got the document you sent me.

138
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:47,790
For next month's promotion, I'm thinking about a partnership with your market.

139
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:54,210
I'll contact you with further details. Alright, thanks.

140
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,500
It's embarrassing to ask you of my own accord.

141
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,500
But did you enjoy the lunch?

142
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,700
Sorry for letting you know so late.

143
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,100
It was good.

144
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:29,790
When you are done with work, give me a little time.

145
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,320
It'll be brief.

146
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,770
Tell me the time and place.

147
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:42,890
Deputy Choi, line 3.

148
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,250
Oh.

149
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,100
Yes, this is Choi Joong Ki.

150
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:52,850
The Woonjung Foundation was launched purely

151
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:59,030
with the mindset to acquire the public's support and love as did Taejin Group.

152
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:04,040
The bazaar of the Woonjung Foundation that is managed by the wife of the President Jang Won Shik of Taejin Group

153
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,520
went smoothly without any references to the Taejin Group secret fund scandal.

154
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:13,330
Because of the recent scandal with the secret funds, it seems that Taejin Cosmetics' Vice President Jang Kyung Joon's

155
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,610
succession to Taejin Group has become more certain.

156
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,010
Ahjumma!

157
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,450
Yes.

158
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,890
Call me Miss.
(Agassi is for young mistress of the house)

159
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,230
Excuse me?

160
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:29,390
Did you not understand? I said call me Miss.

161
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:32,290
But why Miss?

162
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:38,770
I want to feel like an aristocrat. These days, money is what defines class and rank. So in that sense, I am an aristocrat.

163
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,830
Yes.

164
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,870
Say it.

165
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,470
I'll do it slowly.

166
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,360
Let's go out.

167
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,580
I'll show you what type of person I am. Then you call me Miss more easily.

168
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,310
Welcome!

169
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:02,070
I was going to contact you because we have a new arrival.
- Oh, really?

170
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,830
Is this your older sister?

171
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:08,490
No, just an old lady. Ahjumma, go look for something, I'll buy it for you.

172
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,750
No, it's fine.
- Please guide around Ahjumma here.

173
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,010
Please come this way.

174
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,290
Do you like this style?

175
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:22,530
I don't necessary like it but I bought it because it's cheap and practical.

176
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:26,410
Oh, you like something that has practical use.

177
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,670
How is this?

178
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:33,070
How much is it?
- Just take it when she's offering.

179
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:36,230
It's polite to just let people brag when they want to brag about money.

180
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:40,550
Even so, how much is it?
- $2,700.

181
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,470
With a little discount.

182
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:50,550
Do you have limited edition products that just arrived? I like limited edition products.

183
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,390
We have. Should I show them to you?

184
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:55,250
Just give them to me. The designs here are all similar.

185
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,110
Ok.

186
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,150
My time is up.

187
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:03,170
I'm buying you a bag. You can think of that as time.

188
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,410
I don't need the bag.

189
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:10,660
Why? You really act poor. It would be sophisticated of you to accept what I buy you.

190
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,230
I like my denim bag. It's light.

191
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:17,210
Aigoo, seriously. How can I be nice to you if you act like this?

192
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:21,310
I'll get going then.
- Didn't you forget something?

193
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,910
I don't think I can say that while looking at you.

194
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:29,710
Ahjumma, you really are subjective.

195
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,750
Miss...

196
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,830
Yes?

197
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,610
Why aren't you saying anything?

198
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:25,390
I'm thinking about how to say this.

199
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,410
Oh...

200
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:34,680
I don't have a good relationship with my parents.

201
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,320
I'm close to my older brother,

202
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,890
but I don't have a good relationship with my older sisters.

203
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:43,950
Do you need counseling for family problems?

204
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:48,900
I don't have anything, and I don't have much that I can brag about.

205
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,350
Will you date me?

206
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,950
Is this funny to you?

207
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,650
Yes.

208
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,670
I see.

209
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,620
Are you rejecting me?

210
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,090
Yes.

211
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,590
Oh, I see.

212
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:20,210
Goodbye. Thank you for spending time with me.

213
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:26,030
Ah, if you happen to see me at work, don't be awkward. I'm fine.

214
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,970
Miss Jang Yoon Ha.

215
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,870
Miss Jang Yoon Ha.

216
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,840
A beginning of a relationship

217
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,790
is easier psychologically if you conform to custom.

218
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:05,340
A guy should be the one to ask a girl out first.

219
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:12,670
Family is the most important thing in my life. I have a good relation with them.

220
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:17,850
I have a studio apartment, security deposit, annual salary of $52,000, and a car.

221
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,820
Will you date me?

222
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,770
Yes.

223
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:36,830
Then... we're dating from now on.

224
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,710
Yes.

225
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:51,280
♫ I run to you. Nobody knows my heart but perhaps you will ♫

226
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,660
I can't take you home.

227
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,550
I have an appointment.

228
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:59,990
♫ Romance that gently soaked the corners of my lips ♫

229
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:04,930
♫ Your warm name that stuck onto the corners of my lips ♫

230
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:12,490
♫ Nobody knows why my heart is racing to you ♫

231
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,600
♫ Closer and closer to you ♫

232
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:27,250
Why are you out so late?

233
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:33,870
No way...
- That's right. It's me.

234
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,840
You cannot think weirdly.

235
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,490
It's just that I am a member of the leading company.

236
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,810
What are you doing?
- I told you to stop.

237
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,130
What?
- If you keep doing this,

238
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:49,430
I'll want to date someone who lacks responsibility.

239
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:55,430
I'm going. Good night.

240
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,880
Does this mean... success?

241
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,150
Success!
- Congratulations!

242
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,200
How? He said yes on the spot?
-No.

243
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,930
No, I got rejected and then got asked. He said men are supposed to confess.

244
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:29,010
He's the only one who acts cool.

245
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:32,400
Why are you acting like that? You used you say that he's super cool.

246
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,110
Because my stomach hurts from jealousy.

247
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:37,330
You're so lucky.

248
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:41,030
But why didn't he take you home?
- He said he had an appointment.

249
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:44,990
That's not right. He should've taken you home even if he had an appointment.

250
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:50,570
That's not right. I'm not a child, I can go home by myself. If he's busy, he should go.

251
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:53,090
Are you taking his side already?

252
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:56,180
Eat. Let's eat.

253
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,990
Did you get home safely?

254
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:10,650
No, I went to Ji Yi's house.

255
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:14,370
Come back soon. I'll keep sending messages.

256
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:18,690
Yes. ^^

257
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,370
Stop it.

258
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:22,890
Are you proving that this is the first time you're dating someone?

259
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:26,290
You're smiling from ear to ear whenever you get a text.

260
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,470
Do you perhaps...

261
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:31,130
still like Deputy Choi?

262
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:35,470
Whatever. I don't care a fig about Choi Joon Ki.

263
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:39,870
Then... why are you grumpy?

264
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:43,250
You shouldn't even start dating a bad guy. That's a basic rule of dating.

265
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:47,240
Don't you find out whether he's a bad guy or not by dating him? He could be a good guy to me.

266
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,230
How could a bad guy become a good one? A good guy could become a bad one,

267
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:54,030
but a bad guy can't become a good guy.

268
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,240
Okay.

269
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,980
Oh?

270
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,500
Seriously.

271
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:28,230
Here you go.

272
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,050
Do you like it that much?

273
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,090
I understand girls who go crazy for men now.

274
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,480
That won't do.

275
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,170
What?
- I'll drop you off at Gimpo Airport.

276
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,280
Why?
- Because you'll have freedom for two weeks.

277
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,900
You can go on a vacation or whatever with your new boyfriend.

278
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,230
Have fun. This is my gift to you.

279
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,240
No.

280
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:07,790
If I were father, I would choose you as the successor.

281
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:12,860
That's nonsense! Oppa!

282
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,560
♫ Listen to my story that really has no use ♫

283
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:36,240
♫ And nod your head for me ♫

284
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:41,290
♫ Even if I am immature like a kid  ♫

285
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:46,130
♫ You smile for me just as usual ♫

286
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:51,120
♫ Tears start to form when I'm looking at you, ♫

287
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,910
♫ Since my heart fills to the brim, I start to run to you  ♫

288
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:59,000
You said you have something to do with your family.

289
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,540
It got cancelled.

290
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,450
Did you intend to go on traveling?

291
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:09,310
Yes.... With my older brother.

292
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:13,270
Can you not look me in the eyes?

293
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,440
It's weird.

294
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,220
What is?

295
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:23,250
It feels like a dream.

296
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:27,810
♫ Closer and closer to you ♫

297
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:30,820
What are you doing? People are going to look.

298
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,470
So that it feels real.

299
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:40,060
♫ Everything around me looks so differently ♫

300
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,310
Are you hungry?

301
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:44,940
No.

302
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:49,840
♫ I make the whole world into you ♫

303
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:56,420
♫ The world is dyed with my feelings for you ♫
♫ Tears start to form♫

304
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:59,110
Why aren't you eating?

305
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,610
Come here.

306
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:03,270
No. I know that us dating is real now.

307
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:07,360
What do you think I'm going to do?

308
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,090
♫ Why does my heart race for you ♫

309
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:15,910
♫ Closer and closer to you ♫

Eat a bunch like you did before.

312
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:29,050
Yes.

313
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:33,910
♫ Maybe someone is sneaking a glance at our love ♫

314
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:36,130
You're going home, right?

315
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:40,970
No. I'm going to be at Ji Yi's place for a bit.

316
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:43,790
Ahjumma, give us some more sliced radish kimchi, please.

317
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,190
We're here.

318
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,780
I'll bring your bag up.

319
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,430
I'm strong. Let me do it.

320
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,620
Act like you're a little frail sometimes.

321
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,540
Do you like that girls acting that way?

322
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:59,750
No. I dislike it.

323
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:04,130
I'm going to dislike it. It's not fun if you act too cute all the time.

324
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,580
What?

325
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:33,330
What are you talking about? Hold on.

326
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:34,770
Here you go.

327
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:36,890
What is it?

328
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:40,470
Yes?

329
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,180
What are you talking about?

330
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,890
NEWSFLASH: Taejin Group's Vice President, Jang Gyeong Joon was at Gulf of California in Mexico...

331
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:55,940
What is that?
He was on his yacht when

332
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,700
The boat was shattered when it hit a submerged rock.

333
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:02,830
It has been reported that his body has not been discovered.

334
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:05,570
What are they talking about?

335
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:08,650
That can't be. Call Gyeong Joon.

336
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,800
Wait, I'll do it.

337
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,720
Call couldn't be connected.

338
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,370
Please leave your message...

339
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:21,080
Call the President right now.

340
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,900
There's no way Gyeong Joon would be like this.

341
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,590
That doesn't make sense.

342
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:28,380
He was fine when he left to go on vacation.

343
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,690
Gyeong Joon isn't some ordinary person.

344
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:34,360
He's the heir of Taejin Group. Vice President Jang Gyeong Joon.

345
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,000
How can a Vice President die?

346
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,150
No. There's no way that something bad could happen to Gyeong Joon.

347
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,920
There must have been a mistake.

348
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,960
Right, Yoon Ha. Yoon Ha was with him.

349
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,800
There's no word about Yoon Ha. Call Yoon Ha.

350
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:59,250
Where are we meeting today?

351
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,160
Is there something you want to do?

352
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,400
I get to choose.

353
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:18,380
Butler Hong

354
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,230
She's not picking up.

355
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,280
Hello?

356
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,560
Oh, Yoon Ha.

357
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,560
Is it Yoon Ha? Give me that.

358
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,360
Where are you right now?

359
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,130
I'm at a friend's house.

360
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,240
You're in Korea?

361
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,040
Yes.

362
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,930
Hey! Hey.

363
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:06,440
Vice President of Taejin assumed dead from yacht crash

364
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:17,520
I heard and verified it many times, but I still can't believe it.

365
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,590
Madam, the youngest daughter is coming.

366
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:31,070
What happened? Why would my older brother be...

367
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,510
Mom...

368
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,820
Why did you come alone?

369
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,310
Where's your older brother?

370
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,660
Only you lived? Only you?

371
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,620
We didn't even leave together.

372
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,930
Why are you here alone after you left with him together?

373
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,810
I knew you would be like this...

374
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:03,240
You killed your brother, right?

375
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,630
You killed him. I knew you would do something like this!

376
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:11,080
I knew this would happen ever since he said he would take you with him.

377
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,340
I should have stopped him...

378
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,630
Gyeong Joon...

379
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:18,350
Mom is sorry.

380
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:23,620
Mom is sorry. I should have stopped him...

381
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,200
Die. You should also die.

382
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,960
You should die, too!

383
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:38,320
You should die as well! Die! You should die, too...!

384
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,250
Jang Gyeong Joon

385
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,590
My brother

386
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:41,740
was born with the greatest luck in the world.

387
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:47,670
Everyone I love leaves my side.

388
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:52,600
Even my brother who was born with great luck,

389
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,510
could not avoid my jinx.

390
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:58,550
I...

391
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:01,220
I can't ever...

392
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,770
love anyone.

393
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,300
Sleep well.

394
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:15,510

[Yes]

396
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:04,680
Due to the death of Vice President Jang Gyeong Joon, the stock prices of Taejin have crashed.

397
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:10,620
Taejin Group which was already facing a prosecution investigation due to the secret fund overseas is now facing a difficult situation.

398
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:14,940
President Jang Won Shik of Taejin Group will now place his oldest daughter, Jang Ye Won, former representative of Taejin Pharmaceuticals

399
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:19,090
in the center of the reorganized succession list and is starting new with his company.

400
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:38,510
Come in.

401
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:57,730
You must attend breakfast.

402
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:03,100
The harder the times get, you should act as the center of the family all the more.

403
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:09,390
The President thinks you're managing breakfast, too.

404
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:15,560
You're strong, Mom. I trust you that much.

405
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,960
Okay.

406
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:22,210
Mommy's strong.

407
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:26,230
I'm going to find you.

408
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:29,100
I'm going to find my Gyeong Joon.

409
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,880
He could have hit his head while he was swept away.

410
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,470
And unable to come back because he lost his memory.

411
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:37,850
Accept reality.

412
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,400
I don't care how much it costs,

413
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,150
just hire someone who can find Gyeong Joon.

414
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:45,680
Yes.

415
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,850
I'm going to eat.

416
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:52,290
I'm going to eat a lot

417
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:55,140
and get stronger.

418
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:33,210
You must not be a human being.

419
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:36,770
How is your food going down when your child is dead?

420
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:39,510
Bring more beef.

421
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:47,040
How can you swallow the food?

422
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,720
Let's eat quietly.
- The atmosphere is already down. Why are you being like that?

423
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,960
What are you doing?

424
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,290
Miss...
- Ma'am...

425
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:57,940
She had a few drinks of alcohol.

426
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:01,650
Take her out.
- I asked how you can eat!

427
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:04,050
Your son died.

428
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:09,230
Your older brother died. How could you guys eat?!

429
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:12,290
I'm not human, but you guys aren't human either.

430
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:13,670
Have you gone crazy?

431
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:17,270
My child is out there; no one knows if he's alive or dead. So how can I live without becoming crazy?!

432
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:20,580
Is he just my son? He's your son, too.

433
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:25,020
Accept it. Do you think he's alive because they haven't found his corpse?

434
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,210
Even when he dies, he can't clean it up properly.

435
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:29,350
So?

436
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:32,990
You concluded that he was dead and set a funeral?

437
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:34,470
You cold-hearted–

438
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:37,110
Then do we all die because of him?!

439
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:39,070
Should Taejin Group collapse because of him?

440
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,590
Does Taejin collapse that easily?

441
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:45,920
Does a building slowly collapse? It just collapses.

442
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,160
The company was already having a hard time. The fact that he decided to go on vacation at a time like this...

443
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,910
That was foolish and it proves that he couldn't lead Taejin.

444
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:56,030
It's because you're here.

445
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:58,680
He left because you were here.

446
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:03,250
Have you ever trusted him? You only tested him!

447
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:06,180
I was trying to make him stronger by testing him.

448
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,270
He's too sentimental and weak!

449
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:11,210
He was an incapable man who didn't have the ability to make dreams into reality, that one!

450
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,430
My older brother...

451
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:18,370
was humane and calm. He was free yet had regulations. And most of all,

452
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:23,000
he had a strong sense of responsibility for the community and our company.

453
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,410
Please do not denigrate him.

454
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,600
Our household is rotten!

455
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:48,590
Why are you butting in? You always butt in when you shouldn't.

456
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,410
Why are you outside?

457
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:03,780
I was waiting for you.

458
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,040
Give me. Give those to me.

459
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,850
It's okay. I'm stronger than you.

460
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:11,380
That's not true.

461
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,700
Right, that's not true.

462
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:17,130
Give me. Put it on my shoulders.

463
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:19,550
Here you go.

464
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:24,300
I'm still useful, aren't I?

465
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,590
I'm going to be sad if you are like this.

466
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:29,020
Don't be sad.

467
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:32,140
It's because I have a guilty conscience.

468
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:37,010
So why are you thinking like this?

469
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:40,630
Because you only suffered after you got married to me.

470
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:47,270
This can't do. I should punish you today so that you don't say anything like this again.

471
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:49,940
Don't punish me.

472
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,390
Your punishment.

473
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:57,460
The bean paste stew you like. If you say something weird again,

474
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:01,810
then I'm going to punish you with bibimbap that you like.

475
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:06,620
If you're bored at home, watch TV.

476
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:10,070
Then, the electricity bill will be high.
It won't be too bad.

477
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:12,820
You work so hard for that money, though.

478
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:15,720
I... wish there was a part-time job for me, too.

479
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,290
Just rest. I'll make money.

480
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:23,300
Then you want to read books? You like reading books, and it doesn't cost money.

481
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,250
Do you want me to bring you some books from Joon Ki's house?

482
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:28,370
Leave it. You're going to worry him.

483
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:32,000
I'm not going to worry him. I'm just grabbing some books from his house.

484
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,430
But still.

485
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:37,560
You get too intimidated by your own son.

486
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:43,340
It's hard living by himself.

487
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:46,490
Don't you want him to get married?

488
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:51,650
I do, too. I'll welcome a woman like me,

489
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:54,120
but women like me are hard to come by.

490
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,220
Hard to come by, of course.

491
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:05,710
When I think of him, I'm ashamed to be his parent.

492
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,300
I'll visit him later. I'll check up on him while I'm at it.

493
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:54,510
Phone still exists. But I'm not sure whether the owner is still alive. I'm worried.

494
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:03,880
Delete

495
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:15,650
♫ Please stop coming close to me ♫

496
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:20,220
♫ Please stop smiling as well ♫

497
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:24,440
I usually don't like putting in the sliced radish kimchi, but I tried it. I copied you.

498
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,630
Why am I copying you?

499
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:32,810
I want to think that you're doing so well that you're forgetting to reply back.

500
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:39,880
Nickel-silver pot is for ramen. Come over to my place. I'll make it for you.

501
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:43,440
P.S. I live alone.

502
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:50,480
♫ I'm pushing you away ♫

503
00:40:53,270 --> 00:41:00,110
♫ Please stop coming close to me ♫

504
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:07,120
I miss you.
♫ Because your warmth will surely shake me up ♫

505
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,500
I miss you.

506
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:14,280
♫ As much as I am holding back from you ♫

507
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,100
I miss you...
♫ As much as I am holding back from you ♫

508
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:26,220
♫ It may hurt but I have to hold back from you ♫

509
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,080
Yes.

510
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:40,180
President wants to see you for a second.

511
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:53,930
We need a hand.

512
00:41:56,670 --> 00:42:00,490
I don't want to take a spot that is now open just because my brother's position is empty.

513
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:02,620
Your opinion doesn't matter.

514
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:07,190
I need time to decide where to use you.

515
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:09,210
I agree with mother.

516
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:12,710
My brother's death is questionable.

517
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:16,240
One person at home to misjudge the situation is more than enough.

518
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,110
You may leave.

519
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:35,620
Are you...?

520
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:38,810
That's right, it's me.

521
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:47,280
It was romantic at night, but it's miserable when I look at it in the morning.

522
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,060
You're that type of man.

523
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:05,700
I want to just pluck that out. It's getting on my nerves.

524
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:13,910
Stop it, Mom. I've spent enough time with you.

525
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:18,250
What? You don't like walking arm in arm with me?

526
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:19,930
I like it.

527
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:22,110
How are you?

528
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:24,900
Oh, yes. How are you?

529
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,020
Mom, you can leave. I'm going with Joon Ki.

530
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,220
Why? Go with me.

531
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:31,520
And let Joon Ki follow us.

532
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,680
Then why would I have called him?

533
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,280
You like Joon Ki way too much.

534
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:40,540
Just who went with you without any complains when you wanted to go to Thailand for a golf trip?

535
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:42,000
I did something not even Dad did.

536
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,800
You show off too much.

537
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,800
So I'm saying we should buy a private plane, too.

538
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,540
We can come and go whenever we please.
How convenient is that!

539
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:51,180
Whatever. You're talking about this again.

540
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,760
I'm saying you and dad should try to make an effort, too.

541
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,860
Until when are you going to stay like this?

542
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:59,140
I can get richer if dad gets richer.

543
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:01,520
Aigoo, seriously. You're way too good at talking.

544
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,880
Are you going to buy a private plane or not?

545
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,580
I'm not going to buy it. What happens if we travel abroad all the time on a private plane,

546
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:09,520
and then get in an accident? Look at what happened to Gyeong Joon.

547
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,740
Why are you mentioning Gyeong Joon in this conversation?

548
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:16,480
Do you know horrible it is? She lost her all grown-up son.

549
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,720
Some say he committed suicide.

550
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:26,210
You know that Yoon Ha girl whom you went on the arranged meeting with? There are rumors that President Jang might put her on the succession list.

551
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:29,070
Where do you hear all of these things when they're not even on the news?

552
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:32,070
I'm the core member of the charity meeting.

553
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:35,610
Give Yoon Ha a call at times like these.

554
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:36,450
Why would I call her?

555
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:38,170
It's good to be in a good relationship with her.

556
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:41,710
She didn't even have a man. It was a misunderstanding.

557
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:46,910
Mind your own business. Do you think she will like it if I call her all of a sudden? Unless time passes a bit.

558
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:51,190
The death of a parent or a sibling bites on the heart. It has nothing to do with time.

559
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:57,120
Everything is different depending on the situation.

560
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,460
You know that, too?

561
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:01,780
Don't fool around.

562
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:08,280
I say, if you look at marriage as a business, there's no other business partner better than Yoon Ha.

563
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,940
She has a private plane, too.

564
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,360
Ah, seriously. You sound so poor.

565
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:17,320
We are chaebols, too. Are you trying to win me over with other family's private plane? I'd rather buy it myself.

566
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:20,560
Then you buy it. Wow.

567
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:29,320
How's Jang Yoon Ha, that part-timer doing?

568
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:33,620
It seems like you have a lot of interest in the market part-timers. Are you bored of Lee Ji Yi now?

569
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:36,600
We didn't even do anything, how could I get bored?

570
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,980
Her dating skills are no joke.

571
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:43,080
So I've put on a skill, too. I haven't called her.

572
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,960
She is probably curious about me to death.

573
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,530
Then why are you asking about Jang Yoon Ha?

574
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:50,570
Taejin Group's daughter that I asked you to look into the other time,

575
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:54,240
is the Food Market's part-timer, Jang Yoon Ha. Same person.

576
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:57,730
Aren't you surprised?

577
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:02,370
Aren't you going to ask why a Chaebol's daughter is working at the Market?

578
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:04,930
Is the princess going incognito?

579
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:08,550
You're kind. You're like my younger brother.

580
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,400
Yoo Chang Soo.

581
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:27,210
Hello?

582
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:30,330
Why are you saying "Hello?" when you know who this is already.

583
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:31,950
This is the first time I saw your phone number, so...

584
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:34,110
What about the Market? Did you quit?

585
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:37,570
I'm about to come. My holidays are over.

586
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:44,290
Yeah, you thought well. Keep coming. Outside is better than staying home.

587
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:45,840
Thank you.

588
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,980
I don't know what to say in situations like these.

589
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,720
Just don't say anything.

590
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,280
Do you want to eat lunch together?

591
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:57,660
No. I have some things I need to wrap up.

592
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:03,240
To be honest, I don't want to wrap it up.

593
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:07,050
But I have to. So it's hard.

594
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,240
You're so complicated.

595
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:15,960
If you don't want to end it, don't. Why do you have to?

596
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:21,400
I should end the call. Someone's calling.

597
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:34,030
Are you on your way?

598
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:35,170
Yes.

599
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:37,250
It was really hard for you, wasn't it?

600
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:42,330
Still, eat and meet up with your friends. Everyone lives like that.

601
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:45,330
I was like that when my grandmother passed away.

602
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:48,570
It feels like a dream.

603
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:50,650
What did Deputy Choi say?

604
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:54,790
I'm relieved that you have Deputy Choi.

605
00:47:56,490 --> 00:47:58,490
Hello?

606
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:02,090
Why aren't you saying anything?

607
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:12,590
Ji Yi, I'll be there soon. Let's talk when I arrive.

608
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:32,530
I saw that this month's performance raised much higher than last month's.

609
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:38,030
I think the special event was effective. But to not fall below right after a big opening, we are working with the marketing team.

610
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:43,510
You should come back to the Planning Department and then we can just visit the Food Market once in awhile.

611
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:46,930
I can't figure out what my brother is trying to do because you're not on the planning team.

612
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:51,010
The Food Market probably won't like it there. There's an employee who's opposed to it.

613
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:55,430
Put those people on a list. They're probably working for my brother.

614
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:15,650
Choi Joong Gi

615
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:33,250
I can't call him.

616
00:49:54,270 --> 00:49:56,390
I miss you.

617
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:00,790
I want to lean on you.

618
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:12,120
Jang Yoon Ha.

619
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:24,580
Hello?

620
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:28,170
Are you able to talk?

621
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:29,780
I can't for long.

622
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:34,180
I'm sorry that I haven't contacted you.

623
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,950
Let's talk in person.

624
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:42,100
That's why I called.

625
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:48,870
I have... something to tell you.

626
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:51,410
Okay.

627
00:50:57,110 --> 00:50:59,700
Are you dating someone without me knowing?

628
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:02,390
Go to sleep.

629
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:18,210
Yoon Ha!

630
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:21,820
Why aren't you inside?

631
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:24,320
To go inside with you.

632
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,780
Nice to see you, friend.

633
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:30,220
You heard about a ghost who died because they couldn't say anything, right?

634
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,460
I understand that.

635
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:34,730
Did you miss me that much?
- Yes.

636
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:39,610
I missed you so much that I couldn't talk to anyone when you were gone.

637
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:42,710
I smile because of you.
- Success!

638
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:44,680
Let's go.
- Okay.

639
00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:50,160
We came all the way here while we were talking.

640
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:54,040
We can just go up again. It's good that we didn't go all the way to the parking lot.

641
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,800
♫ Paralyzed ♫

642
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:17,980
Get on.
♫ by ancient delight ♫

643
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:21,290
♫ I try to fall and fall ♫

644
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:24,530
Let's get on.

645
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:31,190
♫ I am dressed in style, so eager in mind ♫

646
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:37,320
♫ But furthermore distracted by you ♫

647
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,860
♫ And it's like I... ♫

648
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:43,110
Everyone is getting off the same floor besides me.

649
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:45,290
Are you talking to me?

650
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:50,430
No, I was talking to myself.

651
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:56,660
♫ Oh, I've got no clue how I could fight that ♫

652
00:52:56,660 --> 00:53:03,650
♫ All that I am is worth a dime ♫

653
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:07,290
♫ Worth a dime ♫

654
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:10,470
Wait.

655
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:14,210
I'm borrowing her for a second.

656
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:23,400
Wow. They act like they're filming a movie.

657
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:45,160
I'm sorry to the point that I can't even say I'm sorry.

658
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:50,590
When you were on the phone with Chang Soo, I was there.

659
00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:54,750
I just found out that you answered everyone's calls except mine.

660
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:03,590
When you break up,

661
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,840
is it the man or the woman

662
00:54:08,770 --> 00:54:14,520
who's supposed to say it first if you conform to customs?

663
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:20,180
The one who wants to break up.

664
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:34,170
Thank you for everything.

665
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:40,650
You didn't do anything wrong. It's just my problems.

666
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:43,850
Don't drag it out

667
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:47,670
and look at my eyes while you tell me you want to break up.

668
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:21,440
Let- Let's break up.

669
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:28,350
Is that the look of someone who wants to break up?

670
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:35,490
I lied to you.

671
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:39,280
Everyone lies. I did, too.

672
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:44,790
I'm not poor.

673
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:50,370
I started my part-time job to endure my family.

674
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:55,200
I could leave if I don't like my family, but I was scared.

675
00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:00,510
Becoming poor by myself, I prepared to live on my own.

676
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:05,020
And I thought I was a pretty good person.

677
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:11,710
I thought I made a realistic choice, but...

678
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:17,100
my brother died.

679
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:22,050
There's no way my brother would've died.

680
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:24,920
Do you know what type of person my brother is?

681
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:30,100
He's the Vice President of Taejin Group. My brother...

682
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:35,770
he was born with all of the luck that a human can have.

683
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:56,880
Everyone I love...

684
00:56:58,890 --> 00:57:00,800
all get hurt.

685
00:57:02,370 --> 00:57:08,800
Everyone I love, all leave my side.

686
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:13,540
Ever since I was born, my mom became miserable.

687
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:17,080
So...

688
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,920
So leave me.

689
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:20,430
When I let you go, leave-

690
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:23,540
Misery is something you choose to have.

691
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:26,500
Don't try to take responsibility for someone else's misery.

692
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:42,940
I missed you.

693
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,900
I wanted to come run to you.

694
00:57:47,990 --> 00:57:50,730
But I couldn't do that.

695
00:57:55,070 --> 00:57:58,420
What if you get hurt because of me?

696
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:04,010
You're not someone who's that outstanding for that to happen.

697
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:10,720
Don't leave me.

698
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:15,200
Please don't ever leave me.

699
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:19,000
♫ Please don’t dream of me ♫

700
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:29,900
♫ I’m also pushing you away like this ♫

701
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:40,270
♫ Please stop coming close to me ♫

702
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:47,600
♫ Because your warmth will surely shake me up ♫

703
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:51,600
♫ As much as I am holding back from you ♫
