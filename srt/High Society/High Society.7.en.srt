1
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,100
I'll pour for you.

2
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,390
Joon Gi?

3
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,010
What?

4
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,790
I trust you.

5
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,210
Why all of a sudden?

6
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,300
Do you trust me?

7
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,880
For me,

8
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,290
I think there are two reasons as to why people don't express themselves.

9
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,330
1. They don't like the person.

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,900
2. They don't like the person but they don't want to leave.

11
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,040
Joon Gi?

12
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,720
Why are you here?

13
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,470
Why did you come here?

14
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,500
I called her.

15
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,530
Make some room for her.

16
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,300
Sit here.

17
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,120
Can we get some beer?

18
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,640
Do you have ale beer? I like ale better than lager.

19
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,770
Yes, we do.

20
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,290
What about you, Joon Gi?

21
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:11,330
I can just drink this.

22
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,900
Are you guys dating?

23
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,640
We are.

24
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,820
Why are you telling me this now?

25
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:40,520
If you told me earlier, I would have been careful because I had a blind date with Yoon Ha.

26
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,990
Just act as you are. It's weirder if you're careful.

27
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,950
You told him, right? About our blind date. To Joon Gi?

28
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,990
It's something I needed to tell him since you guys are friends. You guys might feel bad.

29
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,890
Did you tell Ji Yi that we had a blind date?

30
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,300
I did.

31
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,180
Why did you do that?

32
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,290
I should have told her first.

33
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,270
I have to live first.

34
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:08,650
If she heard it from you first, how mad at me would she be? It'll seem like we tricked her.

35
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,990
It's not tricking.

36
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,040
I didn't know you guys were dating. I found out today.

37
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,570
So why would you do part-time work while hiding it? You were no joke, you were the top search topic.

38
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,750
Me? Why?

39
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,670
Do you know?

40
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,760
Yeah.

41
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,430
You tell her.

42
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,130
Making me frustrated.

43
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,810
What about Ji Yi? You said she was coming?

44
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,360
She said she's not coming. I was originally going to drink with all four of us.

45
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,880
With that I was going to reconcile with her but she's not listening.

46
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,690
Why are you getting up?

47
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,380
I'm going to leave.

48
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,760
If you're going to Ji Yi, then let me go with you.

49
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,920
Forget it. Do you think she'll want to see you?

50
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,160
If it was me, and someone deceived me for such a long time, I wouldn't see that person ever again.

51
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,030
Aren't you underestimating her because she's nice?

52
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,470
What's wrong with you, really?

53
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,210
Being friends with you, our Ji Yi must have been tired.

54
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,410
Don't speak like that.

55
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:00,500
Have fun. I'll pay.

56
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,680
Why did I come up on the top search topic?

57
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,250
Let's have a drink first.

58
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:21,150
High Society
Ep 7

59
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,560
She's really the daughter of Taejin Group? Then she's been lying to me this whole time?

60
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,470
It's not like that-

61
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,410
Why are people like this?

62
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,390
Don't you have feelings for each other? You guys had a blind date.

63
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,830
Before seeing you, I had a set up meeting.

64
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:43,720
As soon as I sat down, I came to you. Do you want to be a girl who goes on blind dates with me, or a girl who's in front of me now?

65
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,200
What is it?

66
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,740
Where are you?

67
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,280
You don't need to know.

68
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,000
Ah, your anger is lasting for a while.

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,840
You normally feel better quick. Yoon Ha came and was looking for you.

70
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,720
"Yoon Ha came?" You must be really close to Yoon Ha.

71
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,680
You guys already had a blind date and your classes are the same. Why aren't you dating her?

72
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,900
Class? What class?

73
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,680
If you think like that, you're twisted.

74
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,700
Who was the one who said even though we may have same status, we are still different?

75
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,700
If I argue about class, I'm twisted.

76
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,440
But if you talk about social standing, then you're not, right?

77
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,100
Go to sleep.

78
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,290
How can I sleep like this?

79
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,040
Now that I think about it I didn't even get to eat.

80
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,500
Why do I have to starve?

81
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:56,200
Uh, the last time you said single dish menus are not meant for delivery.

82
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,540
The chicken feet set can be delivered, right?

83
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,630
Yeah, it's me.

84
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:11,090
What do you mean where am I? I'm on the streets. I'm on my way home.

85
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,650
Who's coming?

86
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:22,340
How did an article about me working part-time get released?

87
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,330
It was bound to happen anyway.

88
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:28,440
If this type of article comes out, you'll receive attention, and if you receive attention, your position in the household will get better.

89
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,110
I don't care about my position in the house.

90
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,490
I went to the company this afternoon and met with my dad.

91
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,490
I told him I want to be independent.

92
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,700
He told me to.

93
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,650
Is being independent from your family possible?

94
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,490
Not just physical independence, but emotional one as well...

95
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,570
I was already independent from them emotionally.

96
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,500
I lived away from them in middle school.

97
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,700
You know...

98
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,700
There are probably parts of me that are twisted.

99
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,700
I have a lot of doubt and I have a lot of wariness, too.

100
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,380
I don't know about doubts.

101
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,700
Did you doubt me, too?

102
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,150
Thinking back, I didn't doubt you.

103
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:24,070
It was because at first, you weren't my partner, but a person for Ji Yi.

104
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,790
The guy Ji Yi liked.

105
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:30,030
Another one. Because you're Chang Soo's friend.

106
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,940
Because the people around me were all connected to you.

107
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,460
And your mom was a strong deciding figure, too.

108
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:40,700
I really like your mom. It's nice to see you guys get along well.

109
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,580
It's fascinating.

110
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,840
It's the first time I've opened up to a person so easily like this.

111
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,380
But don't think of it as a bad thing.

112
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,920
Those who come inside my boundary, I trust them to the end.

113
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,540
Who are the people who came inside your boundary?

114
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,300
There are a few.

115
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,300
Someone that you know is Ji Yi.

116
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,670
Do you think she would be very angry?

117
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,330
It's a situation where she would get angry.

118
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,210
This won't do.

119
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,350
I think I have to go to her.

120
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,900
I don't think I can leave her alone like that for long.

121
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,600
Seven Year-Old

122
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,370
You're not going to answer it?

123
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,860
It's my second older sister.

124
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,940
She called to pick a quarrel. She's sensitive to social media.

125
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,820
Then shouldn't you have to go home first?

126
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,900
Ji Yi is first.

127
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,260
I'll drop you off.

128
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,400
It's okay.

129
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,940
I haven't dropped you off once.

130
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,520
A man dropping off a girl at her house is a joy of dating as well.

131
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:52,300
Won't you give me joy?

132
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,440
Taejin Group's Youngest Daughter, Jang Yoon Ha. Who is she?

133
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,720
What the heck is this?

134
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,200
From her actions, it looks like she's been preparing for it in a premeditated and elaborate way.

135
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,940
From a young age, she was a bit different.

136
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,760
She didn't play with us and she played well with the helpers.

137
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,710
Because of her, the innocent helpers all got fired.

138
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,210
She was appointed as Team Leader of Strategy in China.

139
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:22,170
It seems like the President is expecting a lot from her because of her experience studying abroad in China.

140
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:25,810
She's a child who wanted to study in China in 6th grade.

141
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:29,500
If you're in 6th grade, you're 13 years old. What does a 13 year old know?

142
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,380
Now that I think of it, she's very different from others.

143
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,840
I think that the article about Jang Yoon Ha being a part-timer at a market

144
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,500
was released from the President's side.

145
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,850
What?

146
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:44,750
It doesn't seem like a coincidence that this type of article was released right before the official announcement of her position.

147
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,670
That's his method, starting a war on loyalty.

148
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:52,260
He seems like he's going to give things to you, but he doesn't give you certainty.

149
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,980
I thought I could finally just focus on my work, but it's like this again.

150
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,140
They said that Team Leader Jang Yoon Ha stopped by the company earlier in the day today.

151
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,700
She probably received some sort of promise from him.

152
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,240
Even if he does that, I don't think he considers her my competition.

153
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,400
He's testing me.

154
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,590
Just like he used me to help Gyeong Joon grow.

155
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,410
But even if he does that, you should be careful.

156
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,930
It's a media war nowadays.

157
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:16,250
If she's packaged nicely, she can become a skilled person overnight.

158
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,840
She has a lot of conditions that the media likes.

159
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,830
What conditions?

160
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,950
First, her looks are outstanding.

161
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,050
She's tall and looks–

162
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,250
What's pretty about her?

163
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,110
What are you going to do if your standards for beauty are so low?

164
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,600
So Hyeon's prettier.

165
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,180
Your position becomes dangerous if you have that type of judgment.

166
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,020
I'm sorry.

167
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,240
Mom, Mom!

168
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,580
Mom, did you see this?

169
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,260
What is it?

170
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,380
Look at it! Look at Yoon Ha!

171
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,360
I can't see because I don't have my glasses.

172
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,900
You can't see the photo either?

173
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,960
Here, your glasses.

174
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,620
Mom, did you know she was doing a part-time job?

175
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,660
What type of part-time job?

176
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,900
She was working part-time at Yoomin Department Store. It came out on the news.

177
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,920
Why would she do that?

178
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,800
That's what I'm saying. Why would she do that?

179
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,100
Even if she did, why are you getting your temper up over her part-time job?

180
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,640
Some actor uploaded her photo on social media

181
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,600
and said she's a sensible chaebol daughter.

182
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,740
It got over 100,000 likes!

183
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,980
30,000 was my highest. Ugh! So frustrating!

184
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,600
This is all because father doesn't let me use my social media.

185
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,060
I don't know what you're talking about.

186
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,860
I can tolerate everything else.

187
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,240
But the comments say that she's pretty. Why is she pretty?

188
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,740
The comments say that it's the first time seeing a chaebol that pretty! They've all become crazy!

189
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,840
Calm down.

190
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,480
Ah, really. Okay. Calm down.

191
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,900
Unnie! Did you know about Yoon Ha doing part-time work?

192
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,940
Has Yoon Ha come back?

193
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,480
She doesn't even answer my calls.

194
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,650
Did Mom not try to contact her?

195
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,450
Mom, have you tried contacting Yoon Ha?

196
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,170
She said she was coming in.

197
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:56,100
She said she was coming in. Looks like she didn't completely leave.

198
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,380
Why would she leave completely?

199
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,820
She said she was ready to leave completely.

200
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:04,160
Ye Won said that Gyeong Joon oppa even bought her stocks under her name.

201
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,500
What? Why would Gyeong Joon do that?

202
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,700
Since I mentioned Gyeong Joon Oppa, Mom's reacting.

203
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,080
♫ Yeah. Here we go. I'm feeling good right now. ♫

204
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,880
Oppa!
- Oh, hey.

205
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,100
Hey, Chang Soo!

206
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,960
Oppa! It's been such a long time.

207
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,640
It's been a while.

208
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,380
I heard you had an arranged date with Shi Hyun.

209
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,380
Who said that?

210
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:52,520
Shi Hyun said so herself. That you're the same bastard as you were in the past.

211
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,580
She's the same back then and now, too.

212
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,500
Oppa!

213
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,960
Oh, Min Jung, it's been a while. You're doing well, right?

214
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,880
Do you think I'd be well? You heard the story.

215
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,840
People date and break up, right?

216
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,360
How is Joon Gi oppa?

217
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,200
He's well. He's even dating someone new now.

218
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,560
Already? Did he catch a chaebol daughter or something?

219
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,540
What's that supposed to mean?

220
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,660
That son of a bitch.

221
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,780
Yoon Ha hasn't come in yet?

222
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,960
She isn't picking up her phone calls.

223
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:44,240
She will come in. She's someone who keeps her word.

224
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,180
She knows something about Gyeon Joon that we don't know.

225
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:55,640
Tomorrow at 10am, Attorney Hong will come to reveal Gyeong Joon's will.

226
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,580
You didn't forget, right?

227
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,460
Call Yoon-Ha again.

228
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,200
Butler Hong

229
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:18,160
Don't worry about it. I can do things on my own.

230
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,320
Unnie! This one, this one, too.

231
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,560
Stop it.

232
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:44,300
Well, then I want to stop being your informant, too.

233
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:49,300
Here, pose again.

234
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,480
I'm going to post it on social media.

235
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,240
After looking at my body, everyone will know who's the prettiest chaebol daughter!

236
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,880
How is Mom?

237
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,720
She's waiting for Yoon Ha. Since I lit a fire,

238
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,040
using Gyeong Joon oppa's name.

239
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,620
Why isn't she answering her phone?

240
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,600
How would I know that?

241
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,120
Oh, tomorrow Attorney Hong is coming to reveal Gyeong Joon oppa's will.

242
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,780
All of his possessions will probably go to Hye In, right?

243
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:21,580
If he wrote up a will, then he probably chose a guardian.

244
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,860
Oppa's quite elaborate.

245
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:28,120
Who would have thought that he would have a will written out?

246
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,220
Unnie, did you do it?

247
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,340
Why would I do that?

248
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:33,540
That's my point. Why would you do that?

249
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,440
He prepared beforehand thoroughly.

250
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,820
He would have probably managed the company really well, if only our father didn't have such a nasty personality.

251
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,060
Are you reading books these days?

252
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,320
Why are books suddenly being brought up?

253
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,140
Read some books.

254
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,180
That way your judgement would get better.

255
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,880
Is it because I complimented Gyeong Joon oppa?

256
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,020
Unnie, I have a head, too.

257
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,080
The guardian is probably Mom, right?

258
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,960
You think so? That's not for sure either.

259
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,520
The things that have happened so far weren't what we predicted.

260
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,320
Then who else is there? He probably didn't assign Hye In's mother as the guardian.

261
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,780
I heard that he paid all settlements when they divorced.

262
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,860
Father? Or Yoon Ha?

263
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,180
Why would Yoon Ha come into this?

264
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,920
You know how much she and Oppa stuck around?

265
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,360
Even the accident happened while them two were on a trip.

266
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,280
Would he ever ask to go on a trip to either you or me?

267
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,720
I'll be waiting.

268
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,400
It'll be quick.

269
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,760
Do it comfortably.

270
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,480
Okay.

271
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,340
Dear God.

272
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:02,460
Why are you giving me such ordeals to go through?

273
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:08,120
I mean, a chaebol is hard to meet once in a lifetime, but two of them?

274
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,100
What did I do so wrong?

275
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,020
Ji Yi.

276
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,920
Hey...

277
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,780
What?

278
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:31,100
Do you not see me?

279
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,280
I can see you but I don't want to.

280
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm sorry.

281
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,140
There's no need to be sorry.

282
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:45,940
You told me you were the daughter of Taejin Group.

283
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:51,140
Since you said you would tell me about your family when you were ready,

284
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:54,300
you didn't trick me.

285
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,860
The thing I'm angry about is that I'm so dumb.

286
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,500
Why?

287
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,680
You and the director knew each other at the market.

288
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,060
I did suspect it then a little.

289
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:14,680
But I couldn't even think of you being a chaebol daughter.

290
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:20,260
But my suspicions towards you were either sponsorship,

291
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,600
or your parents working at the Director's house.

292
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,920
But when I said no, you believed me right away.

293
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:34,260
I...feel like I'm going to die soon.

294
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,540
There's no denying that I received a curse.

295
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:40,820
Hey. Why are you like this?

296
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,980
It's just that....

297
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:49,140
Chaebols, who are hard to meet even once in a lifetime,

298
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,860
why do I meet two of them?

299
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,660
You're on your second bottle?

300
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:02,440
Since when? It's been a while?

301
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,320
Yeah.

302
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:17,320
Ji Yi...

303
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:22,780
I heard that you had an arranged date with that Director jerk.

304
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:25,620
You don't have to worry about that.

305
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:29,560
You know how my heart is toward Joon Gi.

306
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:34,080
You know how high my focus is towards my decisions.

307
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,120
I'm sad.

308
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,260
Why wasn't I born like you?

309
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:46,560
I want to be a woman who can go on arranged dates with that Director jerk.

310
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,860
Have an arranged date, and then I want to be a woman who can date him.

311
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:57,060
But why do I become a woman who can date, but not marry?

312
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:00,520
Who says that? That you can only date and not marry?

313
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,140
That Director jerk said so!

314
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,520
That son of a bitch...! He–

315
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,660
Hey. It's not to the point where you have to curse.

316
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,240
Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.

317
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,060
I wasn't envious of chaebol sons,

318
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,240
but I was envious of a chaebol daughters.

319
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,620
But there was one living right next to me.

320
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,980
It must have been really hard for you.

321
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:38,740
If you live a life that others envy, it's hard to live honestly.

322
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,680
Getting people to understand your pain is difficult.

323
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:50,550
Is there a glass for me? I want to drink, too.

324
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:53,130
There isn't. You don't like soju.

325
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:55,270
Still, I want to drink it.

326
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:14,350
My mom...

327
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:18,130
told me when I was seven years old.

328
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:23,620
"Nothing works out because of you."

329
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:30,440
She didn't hit any of my siblings. She only hit me.

330
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,530
I was always alone.

331
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:42,260
I started to be able to breathe in middle school.

332
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:47,040
Rather than feeling lonely in my family,

333
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,590
feeling lonely by myself was better.

334
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:57,570
Even when my parents divorced,

335
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:00,230
it wasn't horrible.

336
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,890
My mom...

337
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,390
abused me,

338
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,170
emotionally.

339
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:17,410
But...

340
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,350
I understand my mom.

341
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:42,310
I'm jealous of you.

342
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,450
I'm jealous of your personality.

343
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,390
You took my heart.

344
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:53,790
It's not easy to take my heart. On top of that, we met on the streets.

345
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,370
Even though you liked Choi Joon Gi...

346
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:59,090
For me, you let him go.

347
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,310
Try a little bit more.

348
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,280
This is comforting.

349
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,440
Of course,

350
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,520
you're a bit ignorant.

351
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,500
Skip that!

352
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,990
I...

353
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,160
am someone with a difficult heart,

354
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,510
but meeting you made it lighter.

355
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:35,080
If you didn't say I was ignorant, I wouldn't have believed you.

356
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,290
I love you.

357
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:43,810
Ah! I'm becoming sober.

358
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:46,390
I miss that Director jerk.

359
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:50,490
Hey! You think of that Director jerk at a time like this?

360
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:55,160
Oh yeah, Joon Gi is here. Should I tell him to come?

361
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,710
No. If I can't call, neither can you.

362
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,190
Then I'll call for you!

363
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:06,670
Is he really dating? Joon Gi?

364
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:12,090
Yes. Did you like Joon Gi that much? You can't forget about him?

365
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:14,280
What kind of girl is she?
- Why are you curious about that?

366
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,030
I want to know if she's more qualified than me.

367
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,470
I want to know if she's the daughter of a family richer than mine.

368
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:22,870
If she's better than me, I'll congratulate her.

369
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:26,170
He's selfish, calculative and cunning.

370
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:31,690
If it's sweet, he'll swallow it and if it's bitter, he'll spit...
- Joon Gi is my friend. Just stop.

371
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:33,810
If you say any more, you'll just look indecent.

372
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:37,460
You two are saying the same thing. Indecent.

373
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,310
You be careful, too!

374
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:45,580
Do you think Joon Gi is someone innocent who's being your friend because he likes you?

375
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:50,870
Do you know why I was turned down? Because I didn't have enough qualification for him.

376
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:56,370
He investigated my entire background. If there wasn't anything for him to use me for, he threw me away.

377
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:06,210
Do you want to come to Ji Yi's rooftop?

378
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,950
What are you doing here?

379
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:32,510
I'm waiting for Yoon Ha. Did you come here to meet Ji Yi?

380
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:35,290
Yoon Ha called me. To come here.

381
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:37,590
If you look at her, she's quite on the nosy side, actually.

382
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:42,010
She's not like that to everyone. She's only like that to her own people.

383
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:45,250
Wow. How long have you been dating for you to be this close already?

384
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:49,810
Time isn't important in a relationship between a man and a woman. The depth of our feelings is important.

385
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:53,630
What you want to know

386
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:59,270
and what you are not satisfied with, tell me clearly. Don't beat around the bush.

387
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:07,730
I can't figure you out, Joon Gi.

388
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,750
Whether the Joon Gi I know is you,

389
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:14,770
I'm not so sure.

390
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:22,470
I know you are you.

391
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:24,750
Why don't you know me?

392
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,040
I know, right.

393
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:38,070
It's because you only care about yourself. Because everyone always matches up to you.

394
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,590
That's a bit unfair.

395
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:46,030
Even if everyone in the world says that, shouldn't you be the one not to?

396
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:53,130
You don't know me, either.

397
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:16,410
How is living without having to worry about money?

398
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:18,780
Worrying is fear.

399
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:25,330
Because there are other fears besides money, there's no guarantee that you will be happy with money.

400
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:27,860
I see.

401
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,520
Then everyone lives their whole life worrying?

402
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,930
Whether they become rich or not. Then what's the use of being rich?

403
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:36,250
You just don't have to worry then.

404
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,870
I guess so.

405
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:40,810
If you don't worry, a rich person is the same thing as a poor person.

406
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:43,870
Even if it doesn't make sense, it's true.

407
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,570
If you had a lot money, what would you want to do the most?

408
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:54,410
I want to go to a party with a shoulder revealing dress.

409
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:59,390
If I make memories like that, I think I'll be able to make it through life.

410
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:02,440
You've tried, haven't you?

411
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:08,810
Of course. But it doesn't seem to suit me.

412
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:10,470
It wasn't that great.

413
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,970
Are you guys dating?

414
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:18,470
Aren't you suppose to be fighting?

415
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:22,870
Hey, Lee Ji Yi. You're supposed to hate her.

416
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:25,150
Why?
- She tricked you.

417
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:27,790
Talk about yourself.

418
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:31,050
What's up with being able to date her but not marrying her?

419
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,870
Isn't that so childish?

420
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:37,170
I know! We are in our 20s. I think his thoughts are outdated.

421
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:42,110
Shouldn't something have changed if you're in your 20s? When your chaebol status doesn't even fit in the top 10...

422
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:45,410
Hey!
- Isn't your family's company bigger than his?

423
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:47,210
It probably is.

424
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:56,390
Let's go now.
- Hey, Joon Gi!

425
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,580
Did you hear what they were saying?

426
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:02,590
No.
- You didn't see them teaming up and ganging up on me?

427
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:05,150
I should have seen it. What a waste.

428
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:10,290
Joon Gi, I drank a lot.

429
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,310
It's okay. I'll take you home.

430
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,960
Director, I also drank a lot.

431
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,230
Go inside and sleep. Don't cry and whine later on.

432
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:50,710
I'm sleepy.

433
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,590
Sleep.

434
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:58,130
What if I sleep with my mouth open and start drooling?

435
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:06,510
Sleep.

436
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:38,320
I'm sorry!

437
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:42,490
That's the second time you're saying sorry.

438
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:46,590
Out of the girls I've dated, you're the first I've said sorry to.

439
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:52,180
If everything's a first, I'll think of it as a good thing.

440
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:56,460
I like it because you are so positive.

441
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,550
Since you like it, I'll think of it in a good way.

442
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,370
Since you're smiling, I'll think of it as a good thing.

443
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:12,760
♫ Please don’t leave ♫

444
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:20,630
♫ I’m in love with you like this too ♫

445
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:28,340
♫ As much as I pushed you away ♫

446
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:36,550
♫ From beginning, I was loving you ♫

447
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,500
Are we here?

448
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,840
Yeah. What do we do about the car?

449
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,360
It'd be nice if we could go in together.

450
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,170
Next time.

451
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:02,620
Next time. I just have to get and tell the security team to take the car in.

452
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,880
Alright. I'll go.

453
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,630
Do you know how to get home from here?

454
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,630
I'm not a little kid.

455
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:13,220
You're just...leaving?

456
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,540
Yoon Ha has come.

457
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,430
Sit.

458
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,490
Until now, I haven't asked you, but

459
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:00,310
now I need to know.

460
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:04,770
Because the last person Gyeong Joon was with was you.

461
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,630
Please continue.

462
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:10,670
What did Gyeong Joon say to you when he dropped you off at the Gimpo Airport?

463
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:16,140
He said it was a gift. A two week vacation for my boyfriend and I.

464
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:19,030
You have someone you're dating?

465
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,000
Yes.

466
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,910
Were you with that man yesterday?

467
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:24,940
Yes.

468
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:28,420
You're doing all sorts of things now.

469
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:33,080
I have thoughts of marrying him.

470
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:38,410
I already told father. That I am going to become independent.

471
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:41,880
Independent?
- I don't want to stay in this house anymore.

472
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:46,020
I don't want to stay at a house without my brother.

473
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,810
I couldn't choose the family I was born into,

474
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:52,590
but I will choose the family I'll establish a household with from now on.

475
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:54,840
I want to raise a family that possesses warmth.

476
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,190
If it's with that man, I think it's possible.

477
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:00,820
I have no idea what's on your mind.

478
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:04,170
It's scary. Even secretly meeting a man,

479
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:07,150
coaxing Gyeong Joon and even getting stocks from him.

480
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:10,600
Are you leaving after taking what matters?

481
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,610
What do you mean I received stocks?

482
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:15,850
I heard that Gyeong Joon bought stocks in your name.

483
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:17,450
I didn't know that.

484
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:21,190
Of course, you have to say you didn't know.

485
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:24,090
After being satisfied with the vacation that you got, did you go to that man?

486
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:27,620
If it's good for you, do you not think about others?

487
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:30,370
Staying at a friend's house was that man's house?

488
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:35,210
Mother, I know that you are having a hard time, but please don't be insistent.

489
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:39,470
Do you think you can really live if you leave this house?

490
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:40,950
Yes.

491
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:46,400
Since it's getting late today, you should go to sleep. We'll talk tomorrow.

492
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:51,410
I just found out now... that Gyeong Joon bought stocks in your name!

493
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:54,350
Are you not curious at all? Why he did that?

494
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:56,340
Even so, you only think of leaving?

495
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:59,810
If you leave like that, do you think you can live happily?

496
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,360
I want to live normally.

497
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,590
Gyeong Joon thought of you so much.

498
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:07,960
Your brother died– No,

499
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:12,240
it hasn't been that long since he's gone missing and you're going out meeting a man and doing all sorts of things.

500
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,030
Doing that, are you still human? Do you think I'm being like this to you for no reason?

501
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,910
I'm doing so because you deserve it!

502
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:24,790
Do you think that father will really just let you leave the house?

503
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,670
After living with him for this long, you still don't know him?

504
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:33,180
We need extra hands for the company. You are part of this family's bloodline.

505
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:37,750
Ahjussi, please take care of mom.

506
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:41,100
You're crossing the line. Who are you to be asking for me to be taken care of?

507
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:48,380
I can't control myself whenever I see her.

508
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,990
It's probably because she looks exactly like the President.

509
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:52,860
Give me my sleeping pills.

510
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,280
Okay.

511
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:10,350
I don't understand. Why did my brother buy stocks for me?

512
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:12,380
You didn't hear anything from him?

513
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,470
Yes.

514
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:16,940
Gyeong Joon wouldn't do that without thinking about it.

515
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:19,210
There definitely has to be a reason.

516
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:27,400
What is it?

517
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,850
If anything happens to me, find this and open it.

518
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,780
What?

519
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:38,720
It's nothing. I'll tell you later.

520
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:49,120
I have stalkers nowadays. My position is that type of position.

521
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:53,010
In simpler terms, I'm enjoying focus and control.

522
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,200
So you've come back.

523
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,490
What are you doing here?

524
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:15,040
I will be using this place from now on.

525
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,000
Why?

526
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:19,310
I'm getting a divorce.

527
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:24,180
As I got older, I realized in the end, family is all I've got.

528
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:30,230
Gyeong Joon isn't even here. Shouldn't I at least play the role of the firstborn?

529
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:35,480
What are you doing here?

530
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,570
Did you leave something behind?

531
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,880
No.

532
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,540
I heard you're starting to work tomorrow.

533
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:47,190
If anything's hard, tell me. I'll help you.

534
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,050
I'm not going to work.

535
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:52,520
Your appointment to the position has been confirmed. I told Father

536
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,230
to give you some work.

537
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:59,040
I don't have any thoughts of working for the company. I told father already today.

538
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,570
You did?

539
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:05,450
Yeah. Are you...going to sleep here at home?

540
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,680
No, I have to go, of course.

541
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:12,370
I should come back when this place is remodeled.

542
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:16,160
Are you going to stay here longer?

543
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,810
No. I have to go, too.

544
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:39,910
Something about Yoon Ha bothers me. Look into her surroundings thoroughly.

545
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,460
Okay.

546
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:46,340
You'll be free for two weeks. With your new boyfriend,

547
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:52,350
whether you go on vacation or whatever you do, enjoy. This is my present for you.

548
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:54,200
Why are you being nice to me?

549
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,470
A brother is doing this for his younger sibling. What's so nice about that?

550
00:40:57,470 --> 00:41:01,080
I wish your era would come sooner.

551
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,530
Because you're a warm-hearted, good person.

552
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:16,750
Oppa!

553
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:25,150
Oppa...

554
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,750
Choi Joon Gi. 29 years-old. Yoomin Department Store Planning Department Deputy.

555
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:19,690
Graduated from an all male high school. Seoul University, economics major. Father's highest education was middle school. Father was a construction worker then a security man.

556
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:23,500
Has cerebral apoplexy. In process of recovery. Currently has no job. That is it.

557
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,290
Really...

558
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:28,310
Even if you get involved with other people, how do you get involved with that type of person?

559
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:33,470
His height is 188cm. He has the appearance of a model.

560
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:35,650
Are you calling that an answer right now?

561
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:39,310
As of now, that's the only way for me to explain it.

562
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:47,310
Tell Yoon Ha to come here.

563
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:05,030
I heard that Gyeong Joon bought stocks for you.

564
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:08,710
Aren't you curious at all? Why he did that?

565
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:12,160
There's no way Gyeong Joon would do that without having thought about it.

566
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,980
There is definitely a reason.

567
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:18,600
If I were Father, I would have made you the successor.

568
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:29,750
Sit.

569
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:37,350
Are you working part-time at Yoomin Department Store?

570
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:38,750
I quit.

571
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:42,090
People are talking about it mindlessly.

572
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:45,490
I'm already having a hard time with the company's image. Are you trying to add to that?

573
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:48,090
Everything has pros and cons.

574
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:53,610
You said that focusing on the pros will make a path.

575
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:56,920
So?
- You can make use of it for the image of the company.

576
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:01,370
"Chaebol daughter who works part-time. Head of Taejin Group, Chairman Jang Won Shik.

577
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:06,830
He teaches his daughter the wholesome worth of manual labor."

578
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:09,990
When are you going to leave home?

579
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:15,530
Just tell me the plans you have for me. What's so important about my plans?

580
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:19,040
Go to work.

581
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:23,210
Alright.
- What? Alright?

582
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:25,180
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

583
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:29,570
Usually girls change their minds up to twelve times a day.

584
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:36,730
If I need to work at the company, I need to prepare. Give me a few days to prepare myself.

585
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:42,430
I understand.

586
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:50,100
Attorney Hong has come.

587
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:54,070
Soon, they will be revealing Vice President Jang Gyeong Joon's will.

588
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:05,350
All of Vice President Jang Gyeong Joon's possessions will be

589
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:07,610
passed onto his child Jang Hye In, and

590
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:13,910
until Jang Hye In comes to legal age, his legal guardian shall be Min Hye Soo.

591
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:19,930
You've worked hard.

592
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,850
What?

593
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:39,690
I've decided to work at the company.

594
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:43,590
I knew that would happen. Would a shrewd kid like you just leave?

595
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:46,230
Why are you so cynical?

596
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:49,190
Do you know how sad I am after losing my brother?

597
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:53,310
You and I have something similar. We both lost a loved one.

598
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:58,380
I know how hard that is, so I'm staying still.

599
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,880
I have some doubtful points about brother's death.

600
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,700
I'll stay until I reveal that.

601
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:07,130
Can't we get along?

602
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:10,190
Get out.

603
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,890
Yeah.

604
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:57,250
You went home safely, right?
- I'm able to answer the phone so, of course, I did.

605
00:46:57,250 --> 00:47:00,130
What are you doing?
- Just...

606
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:01,790
I'm just here.

607
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:04,870
I thought you were leaving your house. How can you just stay there?

608
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:07,630
I've decided not to leave.

609
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:13,590
Weren't you really determined?
- I am determined.

610
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:15,670
Before I start, I'm going to warm up.

611
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:17,940
What are you starting?

612
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:21,300
When I look at you, you seem like a really detailed person.

613
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:24,640
There's nothing that loosely passes by you.

614
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:30,980
Why aren't you saying anything?

615
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:33,900
I'm about to eat.

616
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:36,640
It's your day-off. What are you doing?
- I was planning on playing around.

617
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,870
Do you want to play around together?
- Sounds good!

618
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:46,190
If you had a lot of money, what would you want to do most?

619
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:54,310
I want to go to a party with a shoulder revealing dress.

620
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:56,350
If I had that kind of memory,

621
00:47:56,350 --> 00:47:59,630
I think I'd be able to make it through life.

622
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:07,630
Ahjussi!

623
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:10,580
I have a favor to ask you. You have to listen to it.

624
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:12,450
What is it?

625
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:25,330
What's up?
- What are you doing

626
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:27,310
"Should I roll around,"

627
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:31,640
or "If I call that Director jerk first, would I look bad?" Those type of thoughts?

628
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,980
A car is going to go to the front of your house.

629
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:38,240
Why?
- To film a movie. Get ready and come!

630
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:50,900
Prepare a car. I'm leaving now.

631
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,380
Where are you going?

632
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:53,910
Dermatologist.

633
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:57,210
What are you trying to do this time?
- What did I do?

634
00:48:57,210 --> 00:48:59,740
Right now you look like a vampire, stop it.

635
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:02,350
Your dad likes it though.

636
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:06,850
Why are you going around so late nowadays? I heard that you decided to meet Shi Hyun again.

637
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:11,830
You have to be thankful to me. Of my three sons, you're just like me.

638
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:14,230
Min Soon takes after his father so he's a bit odd.

639
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:18,160
I'm fresh, of course.
- Meet her father, and set a date.

640
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,250
If you think about it too much, you won't be able to get married.

641
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:23,290
Forget it, I don't think she's great.

642
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:27,040
Who is it? Is it Yoon Ha? Oh my gosh, it's Yoon Ha!

643
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,860
Ah, I said forget it.
- Do well!

644
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:33,280
Before getting married, two-timing and three-timing are special privileges!

645
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:37,880
What do we have here?

646
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:40,910
What are you doing today?
- For now, I'm about to go work out.

647
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:44,690
Let's hang out.
- Why would I hang out with you?

648
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,590
I feel the same way. I'm saying let's hang out with Ji Yi.

649
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:52,650
You girls hang out by yourselves. Being ganged up on once is enough.

650
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:58,010
Joon Gi will be coming, too. Now have all the requirements been fulfilled?

651
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:04,670
Alright, then.
- You seem to know what to do when you're going to have fun. So arrange a place for us.

652
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:35,870
I'm here to pick you up. Please, get in.

653
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:42,390
Ahjumma.
- Aigoo, yes, yes.

654
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:44,650
Spread these out.
- Okay.

655
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:47,570
Ah, I'm in a hurry, a hurry.

656
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:56,770
Ahjumma, how do I look? Do I look elegant and refined?

657
00:50:56,770 --> 00:51:00,870
How can you leave it there? You should give it to me.

658
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:05,610
How is it?

659
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:10,070
I think your earlier style looks better.

660
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:11,590
What?

661
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:14,150
The store manager put this on me

662
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:19,430
and said that I look like a noblewoman. Why do I even ask you?

663
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:21,200
Where are you going?

664
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,480
Since you don't have anything to ask me, I was going to prepare dinner.

665
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,870
There's a lot of time until it's time to eat dinner. Why get ready now?

666
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:30,680
Alright.

667
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,690
What is that?

668
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:35,010
What?

669
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:41,550
You should tell me more! Like if it looks good on me, if I look like a noblewoman, or if I look sophisticated.

670
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:43,570
How come you're so senseless.

671
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:45,770
It's hard to say my thoughts.

672
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,310
Ahjumma, seriously—

673
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:54,170
How can you say only what you like when you live in someone else's house? You have to match me.

674
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:58,750
Ahjumma, you really are subjective.

675
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:00,650
I actually

676
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:03,830
like people like you.

677
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:07,010
So, I'll ask you something else.

678
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:08,620
Okay.

679
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:14,330
I'm thinking of getting a child. What do you think?

680
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:17,150
Whose child?

681
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:20,630
What do you mean? Do you think I act as his second just for the money?

682
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:24,310
If it was like that, I'd have gotten my share from the beginning.

683
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:27,050
But would he

684
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:29,530
be able to?

685
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:35,230
Well, I first need to have some sort of determination for him to do something.

686
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:37,930
What are you going to do with a child at this age?

687
00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:42,270
I know... it's just a thought I had on the thought of revenge.

688
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:46,470
If you have a child out of revenge, how would that child's life turn out to be?

689
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:52,630
Ahjumma! Say just the first verse. I understood what you meant a while ago. You always repeat these types of things.

690
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:55,390
Now, I'll get ready for dinner.

691
00:52:55,390 --> 00:52:57,210
Steam boil some abalones!

692
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:59,780
Okay.

693
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:04,420
I should find out the President's schedule from Secretary Song.

694
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:16,420
No, you can't! Please don't get off.

695
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:18,440
Ah, yes....

696
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:34,390
Lady is waiting for you inside.
- Ah, yes.

697
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,370
Hey!
- Welcome.

698
00:53:42,370 --> 00:53:45,670
This is your house?
- Yeah. Let's go to my room.

699
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:53,990
Oh my!

700
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:57,350
This is my friend. This is my sister.

701
00:53:57,350 --> 00:54:00,250
Unnie! I'm a huge fan!

702
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:03,050
Now that I'm seeing you in real life, you're really pretty.

703
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:07,230
Unnie, I advertised you everywhere saying you are easygoing and pretty.

704
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:08,780
Really?

705
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:12,720
Unnie, you know the picture you took when you were at the hospital taking vitamins?

706
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:16,340
Yeah.
- Your spelling was wrong.

707
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:21,450
But I saw that and liked you even more! I think you and I are going to get along very well.

708
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:23,410
It was wrong?

709
00:54:23,410 --> 00:54:25,510
I checked it multiple times to get it correct.

710
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:28,870
But seeing you in person, your voice sounds unique.

711
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:31,050
You aren't that normal either.

712
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:33,790
Ah yes. For a girl, I have a deep voice.

713
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:35,750
Let's go up now.

714
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:39,270
See you next time, Unnie!
- Okay.

715
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:44,530
Hey, come in.

716
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:50,250
This is all yours.

717
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:53,310
Whenever I wanted to give you a gift, I bought you one.

718
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:56,190
Now I can finally give them to you.
- Really?

719
00:54:59,110 --> 00:55:00,940
Even the labels are still there!

720
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:06,030
Now, Miss, would you go to tonight's party with me?

721
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:09,020
I only go with men to parties.

722
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:12,720
Of course, I prepared a man as well.

723
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:21,420
♫ Tears are about to come when I see you ♫

724
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:26,230
♫ My heart fills to the brim so I start to run to you ♫

725
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:32,810
♫ Nobody knows my feelings, but if it's you, will you know? ♫

726
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:38,150
♫ Closer and closer to you ♫

727
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:45,950
♫ When I say "I love you" in front of you today ♫

728
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:50,850
♫ When you smile to my words ♫

729
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:57,770
♫ Maybe someone is sneaking a glance at our love ♫

730
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:05,530
♫ Gentle romance soaks into the corners of my lips all day long ♫

731
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:10,410
♫ Your name blooms on the corner of my lips ♫

732
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:18,110
♫ Nobody knows why my heart is racing to you ♫

733
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:21,890
♫ My heart goes closer to you ♫

734
00:56:21,890 --> 00:56:24,890
You!

735
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:27,250
I love you, Yoon Ha!
- Yah~

736
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:32,750
♫ My heart goes closer to you ♫

737
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:36,730
♫ More of you inside me ♫

738
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:41,940
My dad promised to give me hotel stocks as a gift.

739
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:45,990
He wants to keep it secret from my brothers and reduce his tax payment.

740
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:47,710
You take care of it for me.

741
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:51,750
But your share of the hotel doesn't even compare to your second older brother.

742
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:53,530
I know.

743
00:56:53,530 --> 00:56:57,550
Even if I have a way smaller percentage, I have real estate.

744
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:00,370
Land has more potential.

745
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:02,810
I'll look into it.
- Ah,

746
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:05,850
I met Min Jung.

747
00:57:05,850 --> 00:57:08,370
Yeah?
- She had a lot of things to say about you.

748
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:12,650
Oh, you guys probably got a long then. It seems like you have a lot of things to say to me lately.

749
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:16,130
I calmed her down.

750
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:20,310
You think I would talk about you behind your back with her?

751
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:22,120
What are you going to do?

752
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:25,510
It seems like Ji Yi likes you a lot.
- Then what about you?

753
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:29,030
How do you meet someone already knowing the outcome?

754
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:32,090
I'm the same way.
- No, you're not.

755
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:34,660
You already drew a conclusion.

756
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:49,540
They're really late.

757
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:51,670
Call them.

758
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:22,980
What are you guys doing?

759
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:24,730
What?

760
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:29,030
I'm not going to say what you want to hear.

761
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:31,890
What is it that I want to hear?

762
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:35,610
You thought I was going to fall for it, huh?

763
00:58:35,610 --> 00:58:40,310
Can't you just say it? That I look pretty? I took the time and the effort.
