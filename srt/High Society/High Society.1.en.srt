1
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,360
Isn't it sweet and refreshing? June is for oriental melons. It's healthy to eat fruits in season

2
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,700
Because it has a lot of beta-carotene, it's good for the liver and heart.

3
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,100
It's diuretic so it's good for your skin and reduces swelling.

4
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,660
Mm, it's good.

5
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,160
Please get rid of the seeds.

6
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,780
We eat these for the refreshing taste. How could we eat it with all the seeds on it?

7
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,430
Most people usually eat oriental melons for the seeds.

8
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,970
Right? I'm a bit special.

9
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:03,110
Please cut some of that for me too.

10
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:06,420
Customer, I can't.

11
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,620
Why not? I need to taste it in order to determine whether I'll buy it.

12
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,840
It's expensive. I can't use it for tasting.

13
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,440
That's not expensive. It's not even $100.

14
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,110
You can trust and buy the products at a department store.

15
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:21,530
If you buy it and it doesn't taste good, I can exchange it afterwards for you.

16
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:25,540
So, you're saying it could taste bad.

17
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,710
Why would I come back? It's troublesome.

18
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,350
It tastes good. I've eaten it too.

19
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,650
You stole it and ate it, didn't you?

20
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:35,480
Pardon?

21
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,370
Can you buy that with the money you're earning?

22
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,230
You stole it and ate it secretly, didn't you?

23
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,720
I ate it at home.

24
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,550
You're kidding. Why would a kid like you eat that at home and

25
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:48,310
work at a place like this?

26
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,530
You know you're being ridiculous, right?

27
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,300
What? Ridiculous?

28
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,250
This girl, seriously. You!

29
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,480
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, customer.

30
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,000
What are you doing? Bow your head and apologize.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,080
What is this? Are you the manager?

32
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,770
How are these employees taught?

33
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,280
I'm sorry. I'm also a part-time worker.

34
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,050
What?

35
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,750
Hey, call the manager!

36
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:26,110
They say you can solve 90% of your problems with money.

37
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,060
I carry 10% of the problems.

38
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,870
If you look at it statistically, you can be 9 times happier

39
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,700
than those carrying the 90% of the problems dealing with money.

40
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:47,810
However, when numbers are applied to people instead of money,

41
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,710
the numbers always lie.

42
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,110
Go over there.

43
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,220
Stop.

44
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,930
What a wench. Why are you wearing white?

45
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,460
-Are you the only one who can wear white?
-Yup.

46
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,480
I can't believe this beggar-like person is my younger sister.

47
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,850
Ouch.

48
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:10,670
I'm taking the picture now. Look over here. 1, 2, 3.

49
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,950
What is it?

50
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,070
I wasn't the one who did wrong earlier.

51
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,720
-Unnie was mad we wore the same color...
-How old are you guys?

52
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,670
Just because you were wearing the same color! There were people around too! You were being frivolous.

53
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:45,290
What I'm saying is, scold us fairly.

54
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:50,810
No! You're the problem. You're always the problem in our house.

55
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,910
That's right. I'm a problematic person.

56
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,920
Who's trying to find happiness.

57
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:05,070
High Society
Episode 1

58
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:09,780
Miss Jang Yoon Ha, why do I have a feeling that you will repeatedly cause problems?

59
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,680
I did not do anything wrong.

60
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,260
You didn't do anything wrong, but if the customer says you did,

61
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,280
you must apologize. Don't you know the basics of service?

62
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,370
I think there is a limit. To annihilate basic human dignity—

63
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,100
Look at this, look at this.

64
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,800
Human? Dignity? Are you registered in part-timer union or something?

65
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,700
No.

66
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,510
There's nothing to it in life. Let's just go nice and easy. Just apologize for doing wrong!

67
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:35,330
-There are times...
-Ahhhh!

68
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:41,100
Stop it. Do everything by yourself. Or just quit. Why do you quibble about human dignity and stuff when you're just a part-timer?

69
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,090
I'm an official employee and a manager at that. And even I don't quibble over stuff like that!

70
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,300
Miss Lee Ji Yi.

71
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,300
Yes?

72
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,950
You said you wanted to go from a part-timer to an official worker by working hard, right?

73
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,490
-Yes.
-Model yourself after Miss Ji Yi!

74
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:57,010
You don't have hope, do you? If you have hope, you can tolerate whatever anyone says.

75
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,120
Yoon Ha, you don't have the desire to achieve this;

76
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,530
but at this rate, you'll be working at a $5.60/hour rate and kicked out soon! Understand?!

77
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,200
Right now, our team is going through a difficult time.

78
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,840
The profits shine brightening only in the beginning and is taking a downward trend. What do you think our bosses will do then?

79
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,030
They pick on us.

80
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,300
Yes, that's correct. They continuously pick on you.

81
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,020
So why choose the Food Market's concept as department store for the upper class?

82
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:26,940
Because there are stupid people like this above us, the company president's son was put in charge of Food Market sect,

83
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,850
so our profits keep falling. Honestly!

84
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,380
Compared to last year, our Spring Seasonal Sale had decrease in profit of 0.3%.

85
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,060
And in the Food Market's case, which is our company's core business,

86
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,190
the profit decreased by 15%.

87
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:47,480
Stop. The reason why we have this emergency meeting is because

88
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,840
we didn't do well in the Spring Seasonal Sale. But the major reason is the company's food division's core,

89
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,720
Yoomin Green Food's collapse.

90
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,380
Oh, I chose the wrong words to say.

91
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,640
If the sales have risen at least once, it can be called collapse.

92
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,200
It was hitting the bottom from the very beginning and it went further down.

93
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:10,330
You said that the general trend is premium food market for the upper class, yes?

94
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:15,320
You said to trust you, right? How will you take responsibility for that trust?

95
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,480
I will bring the profits back up.

96
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,700
How?

97
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:24,000
Listening to this during a meeting may feel insulting,

98
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:28,620
but Chang Soo, insults create motivation.

99
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,840
Motivation to improve.

100
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:36,240
I believed in the Premium Food Market because it was you. Because you're my younger brother.

101
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,440
If you can't get out of the declining profit stage in three months,

102
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,310
Food Market will come under my supervision.

103
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:01,570
The road to becoming rich is to be born rich.

104
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,230
If you do your best, good things will happen to you.

105
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,800
As long as you have love, you'll be happy doing anything.

106
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,390
Those are the words of my parents. I won't get deceived.

107
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:16,740
Maybe I should shake this. Aigoo!

108
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,720
I fell again. Haha.

109
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,950
Did you fall?

110
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,290
Yeah.

111
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,040
You should've been more careful.

112
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,290
I was careful.

113
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,460
Then you should've been even more careful.

114
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:33,400
I was going to make food for you and do all the dishes.

115
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,060
You came too early.

116
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,590
Madame told me to leave early.

117
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,670
Rest honey. I'll make food for us.

118
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:42,490
What food? There's already rice in the rice cooker.

119
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:47,550
I'm saying, I'm going to make dinner for you. I'm going to make the fried eggs that you love.

120
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,070
You are so lovable.

121
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:54,970
I can never get tired of you after living together for 30 years.

122
00:07:54,970 --> 00:08:00,310
All of a sudden, I became sick, couldn't work, and had to stay home.

123
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,930
I have a lot of changes, huh?

124
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:06,220
That's why you're such a charming man.

125
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,660
Now.

126
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:12,040
The reason why poor people stay poor is because rather than wanting to escape their poverty,

127
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,080
they found happiness in being poor.

128
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,510
You can never be happy when you're poor.

129
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,930
Is this home? Am I his younger brother here?

130
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,780
How much does he look down upon me to be acting like that during a meeting?

131
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,440
I guess he's using this opportunity to kick you out.

132
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,010
Do you think I'll allow that?

133
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,860
Those who are skillful will never be able to win against those who are lucky.

134
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,490
He can do all sorts of things to achieve good results. I'll give him the knockout blow.

135
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,340
That kind of mindset in this kind of situation is good.

136
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:46,160
You take care of it. Go back to Food Market.

137
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,990
You and I are in the same boat. If I'm doing well, then you are as well.

138
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,900
You can do it, right?

139
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,840
I guess I have to do it, even if I can't.

140
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:03,640
You are my real family. Hyung and I are just business partners.

141
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,390
He probably thinks that it's obvious for him to take over the company, but I don't think so.

142
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,950
Wait and see to know who will become the true winner.

143
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:16,690
My first technique is marriage. I'll marry with the Taejin Group's daughter whom I'm having arranged meeting with.

144
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,900
Good days turn into bad ones. You had to get beaten to hell on an important day, of all days.

145
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:34,490
I didn't get hit, my role-model friend. And it's not an important day.

146
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,740
Why are you taking early leave when it's not an important day?

147
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,800
Let's leave it at that.

148
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,030
When you act like this, I feel left behind. I tell you everything.

149
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,920
Why don't you as well?

150
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,690
I told you my heart hurts. When a scab forms over my scratch,

151
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:55,890
and when it doesn't hurt me to see people know about my history,

152
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,380
I told you I'll tell you then.

153
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,630
My name is Lee Ji Yi. Even if you say it backwards, it's Lee Ji Yi.

154
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:07,150
You need distance between people.

155
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:13,290
You're so simple. You laugh so easily.

156
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:18,890
Still, I'm proud of you. You probably wanted to quit on a day like this, but you still stand strong.

157
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:24,010
No, it makes me feel that working here was a great choice on a day like this.

158
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:27,220
You really are a pervert. You shine more when you encounter hardships.

159
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:31,350
I feel relieved that I'm daughter of a rich person on a day like this.

160
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,690
You're staring off into space again. Why do you do that while talking?

161
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:35,690
Sorry.

162
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,850
You're coming later, right? To my housewarming party?

163
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:43,210
Sorry again. I don't think I can.

164
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:46,010
Then buy me a better present if you're sorry.

165
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:51,790
Just wait. How should I celebrate you for escaping
semi-basement flat and getting a rooftop house?

166
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:55,330
Don't go overboard. I don't have a toaster.

167
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:58,010
So buy me a toaster. You can probably buy one for 20 or 30 dollars.

168
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:01,790
I don't want to. I'll buy something much better.

169
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,970
Sorry.

170
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,920
Charity

171
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,940
It's the charity again.

172
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,250
How much did you donate to them to get calls so often like this?

173
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,940
Let's go.

174
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,730
What have you been doing these days?

175
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:20,630
Why did you make me call you two times and not pick up the first time?

176
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,270
I'm sorry.

177
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,470
Did you get your makeup done?

178
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,390
Yes.

179
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:29,450
Do well this time. Why can't you get into the hearts of men?

180
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:34,190
If you get rejected again this time, I'll completely throw out arranged meetings and such.

181
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:57,370
Let's change our meeting location. Meet me at the lobby cafe. I don't like enclosed spaces.

182
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:00,270
What is this now?

183
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,530
You came quickly. As soon as I spoke to you.

184
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,290
This place is still the same.

185
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,880
Where is my seat?

186
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,020
Sit over there. I'll leave it open.

187
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,170
Is that the Director? It must be nice for you. You're the most sucessful out of us.

188
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,230
Yes, Director.

189
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,970
How does it feel to climb up a golden ladder?

190
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:29,150
In order to survive in society, you need to have good connections.

191
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:33,550
Why are you laughing like an idiot? Go.

192
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:36,930
You're at the office right? You really know how draw a line between public and private matters.

193
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:41,610
I can't call Mom. I thought she was going out for the charity bazaar but I think she's getting a face massage.

194
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:44,890
You look on the internet for me. Tae Jin Group's daughter Jang Yoo Na.

195
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,470
There must be a picture of her somewhere.

196
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,070
You'll meet her soon, so why the need for a picture?

197
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:51,310
I just got a message from her saying that she's changing the location.

198
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:54,730
I don't feel too good about this. I need to look at her face beforehand.

199
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:59,310
I need information to look for her. What's her age? What about school?

200
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,390
Wear anything you want.

201
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,970
Ahjusshi, you can go back now. I'll do the rest.

202
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:08,750
No. Agassi told me to take you to the hotel.

203
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:12,790
You're someone who would get a star from the sky if my mom asked for one.

204
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:15,040
She's not someone to ask me to do something absurd like that.

205
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,400
I'm envious of my mom for one thing. Do you know what?

206
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,820
What is it?

207
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,640
You.

208
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,080
How is this?

209
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:29,400
Yoon Ha! Yoon Ha! Hey, Yoon Ha!

210
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,460
Ajussi, please let me breathe as well.

211
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,580
No, we have to go to the hotel together.

212
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:39,710
If you keep coming out like this, I may reveal your secret.

213
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,800
I just barely got one due to the lack of information.

214
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,440
This is a bonus.

215
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,290
Do you want to keep doing your work like this?

216
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,290
I'm sorry.

217
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,750
Find a way to make them stop protesting in front of our company and report it to me.

218
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,250
Yes. The Vice President is here.

219
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,870
Why?

220
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,420
You have such good luck.

221
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:33,080
Mom seemed to be busy setting up the bazaar. Don't you need to go and help her?

222
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,720
I wasn't able to but I did send her a present.

223
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,300
She's someone who would be happy with a present even if I don't go.

224
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:43,640
There's someone born with a golden spoon in his mouth and can do anything he wants. He even get spraised when he messes up.

225
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,200
And there's a person who runs around day and night to get told

226
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,320
to be satisfied with what you have.

227
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,420
It must be great for you. You were born with a golden spoon in your mouuth.

228
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:57,220
How much do you need to be satisfied?

229
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,580
Would you be satisfied by taking everything I have?

230
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,900
Then try giving it to me and we'll see if it satisfies me or not.

231
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:06,820
I'm not curious as to whether it will satisfy you or not. So I have no reason to give it to you, Noona.

232
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:10,090
Why are you here?

233
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,510
Did you see protestors on your way here?

234
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,650
What does it have to do with you?

235
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:17,610
Isn't Taejin Pharmaceutical part of the Taejin Group? I'm the vice president of Taejin Group.

236
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:18,410
So what?

237
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:22,130
Is the Taejin Pharmaceuticals innocent from the protests and lawsuits?

238
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,230
We've kept that position for a long time.

239
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:28,330
I heard something weird today. A person was confined without any crime.

240
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:31,010
If you're a group owner, then protect your subsidiary.

241
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:34,510
It's because you have thin ears, you become swayed easily and get losses and minuses.

242
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:37,130
Don't forget that I'm father's son.

243
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:39,850
Think about what our father did when facing an enemy.

244
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:43,410
Think about what he did to his siblings.

245
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:51,180
It's a fact that I have the power to do something like that to you.

246
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,180
If you have a brain, then think it together.

247
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:01,380
The asbestos that was found in the baby powder, if it's proven that it was used even though you knew of its harmful effects,

248
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,800
you'll be finished from this place, Noona.

249
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,120
Whether I'm finished or not, is for Father to decide, not you.

250
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,640
Father is still the decision maker.

251
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:16,760
We know that he will end the life of anyone who challenges his authority.

252
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:21,520
Don't think that you're an exception. It's still Father's era.

253
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,560
It doesn't look unnatural, right?

254
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,400
Not at all. You know I hate it when it's obvious that one has gotten plastic surgery.

255
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,200
Of course, I know.

256
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:40,580
If you come here a few years later and get surgery to lift the skin under your ear, you'll live like a woman in your 40's forever.

257
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:44,640
What's so great about living like you're in your 40's?

258
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,100
Miss So Hyun, you're still young, so you don't know.

259
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,280
For a woman, the 40's is when they're at their golden prime.

260
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,260
That's something doctors tell their old patients

261
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:57,740
to prevent them from knowing that they can't make them look any younger.

262
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,180
Miss So Hyun, you say some funny things.

263
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:04,400
I hear that I'm humorous and witty quite often.

264
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,440
But it looks like Unnie isn't coming.

265
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:12,380
She won't be able take brother's position no matter how much she tries. She tries too hard.

266
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,220
Think before you speak.

267
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,820
"I'm not sick. I'm taking Vitamins."

268
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,160
Can't you stop doing that? You still can't get to your senses after being scolded that much?

269
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,220
It's because I'm social like this to normal people that our family doesn't get cursed at as much.

270
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:41,120
I have fans too. So many girls wear what I wear.

271
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,840
You still haven't come to your senses after your engagement broke off from you playing around so much?

272
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,420
If your father finds out, you'll lose all the stocks that you have.

273
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,560
I'm making sure he doesn't find out.

274
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,440
And please don't talk about the broken engagement. I feel like throwing up.

275
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,260
I need to go. Father said he would be eating lunch at home.

276
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:02,320
I also have to visit Unjeong Foundation for bazaar. My schedule is packed.

277
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,040
It looks like Ye Won is taking a promise with me lightly.

278
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,740
I got goosebumps all of a sudden.

279
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,680
Unnie got a minus 1 point. She dropped 1 point from the succession list.

280
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,920
Ye Won wasn't even on the succession list.

281
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:19,320
You guys need to know that Kyung Joon isn't your competition rival.

282
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,980
Who are you kidding?

283
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,700
Wow, got goosebumps for the second time.

284
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,560
Ah, hello.

285
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,980
Oh, did you make a promise to meet Hyungnim?

286
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,640
She probably went ahead first. I'm a bit late.

287
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,920
Then let's go in together.

288
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:57,670
You know I'm pushing for you to the President because I like you?

289
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:06,390
Hyungnim, you were still here.

290
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,450
You told me you couldn't come.

291
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:13,270
The thing is, Mom...

292
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:16,940
Taking care of your skin is work. It's important for her to do her work.

293
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,660
Hyungnim, you keep taking care of it to no end, too.

294
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:24,010
I'll be going in first. Mom, I'll call you later.

295
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,610
Hyungnim,

296
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:32,030
it's already 3 bitches this month.

297
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:36,430
One bitch was a waitress at a restaurant and came by for golf once or twice.

298
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,380
Her eyes were completely cut open.

299
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:44,720
This bitch who looks like a short-necked clam, she was sticking around him so she can fix up her life.

300
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,030
You should know it's all thanks to me.

301
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,590
It's because I dealt with all kinds of bitches

302
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:54,670
you are able to elegantly keep your space next to the president.

303
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,410
Agassi...

304
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:59,150
Let's go.

305
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:04,430
Butler Hong! Do you not see me? Why aren't you greeting me?

306
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:10,670
What do you mean "Agassi"? She's past that age now.
(Agassi is for young mistress, Samonim is for older mistress)

307
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,860
I'm very sorry.

308
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:17,920
Hyungnim, it's because you look down upon me that the people under you act so rudely to me.

309
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:23,920
I didn't think we were close enough for you to be calling me Hyungnim. Butler Hong is very old.

310
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:30,310
He's not someone in a place to be looked down upon from someone younger than him. Please show some manners.

311
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:37,480
You are always so cultured, Hyungnim. I'm not envious at all.

312
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,090
What if you are the his wife and the Lady of the House?

313
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:44,610
It's not like it's the Joseon era. He can have concubines all he wants.

314
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:50,810
If I were you, I would have burned up all those bitches' faces with an iron.

315
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:53,540
You are too kind.

316
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:01,390
I'm sorry, Agassi. I should've come earlier.

317
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,400
Is the lunch ready?

318
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,210
It doesn't taste as good as it did last week.

319
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:31,140
It looks like we need to eat it diligently until the end of this month.

320
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,400
Why are you talking so much?

321
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,870
I think there's too much red pepper paste in this.

322
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:40,440
-Make it again.
-Yes.

323
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,510
Eat the marsh snail soup first.

324
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:48,380
You're just saying things. If I told you I was coming in for lunch,

325
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:51,510
you should've checked everything perfectly beforehand.

326
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,170
- I'm sorry.
- I set up a charity for you

327
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:56,450
but don't you think you're slacking with work around the house?

328
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:59,430
I'm trying my best. Stop acting so stubborn.

329
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,850
There's a limit to my patience.

330
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:05,310
I met Han Nam Dong.

331
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:10,370
I won't say anything about you meeting other women. You can meet as much as you want.

332
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,990
- Shut up.
-You

333
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:15,750
do everything you want do.

334
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,910
It's not like you only have one woman like Han Nam Dong either.

335
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:22,370
The core point is, in other words, I get to have everything I want.

336
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:28,330
You live as my wife in return for ignoring and tolerating everything I do and get.

337
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:31,410
Living as your wife is such a trifle...

338
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:34,800
What's so great about living as your wife when your concubines look down on me?

339
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,780
Is that so? Then leave.

340
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,690
If you don't want to live with me, then leave!

341
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:42,670
You say that every time. Do you think I'll become scared?

342
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:46,990
-Do you think I'm living with you because I want to?
-This woman...!

343
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:53,390
You have a bad memory! Do you really not understand?!

344
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:56,030
Do I have to teach you again like this?!

345
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:01,610
I'm the king. If you want to live under this roof, there's no choice but obedience!

346
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:04,310
If you're the king, then I'm the queen.

347
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:07,350
I can't live like this either.

348
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,860
That...!

349
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,310
- Oh, son.
-Are you on your way?

350
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,870
Yeah.

351
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:46,120
- Is everything going well with the bazaar?
-Yeah, we have a preparation meeting today.

352
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,010
If you need anything, tell me. I'll get it.

353
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:52,870
You should be busy with company affairs. You don't need to worry about me.

354
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:56,610
Worrying about you is my work as well.

355
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:59,940
You say such nice words.

356
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:05,150
Please go to Hae In this weekend. I called earlier and it seems like she's having a hard time.

357
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:07,910
It must be hard for her at such a young age.

358
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:11,970
To have her parents divorce and for her to go study overseas.

359
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:15,530
Don't worry. I will act as a father for her.

360
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,910
Thank you very much.
-No need for thanks.

361
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:20,770
After the preparation meeting is done, I'll go immediately to New Jersey.

362
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:23,180
Yes. I'll see you at home later on.

363
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,980
Let's go.

364
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:33,980
It's not like my life will change with me crumbling down and crying.

365
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,870
I'm a bit nervous now that I'm getting ready to marry.

366
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:51,050
Are you serious?

367
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:55,150
I told you I will because of my brother making me upset. You're going up right?

368
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:57,310
Yeah. After I park the car in the parking lot.

369
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,730
Min Jung is lucky today.

370
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,770
It looks like you're very tense, Joon Gi!

371
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,870
Move your arm. My fist will come out soon.

372
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:06,590
Ah, punk.

373
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,630
You are a man after all.

374
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:12,820
I'm just gonna talk for a while and go to the Food Market. Today is my first day.

375
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,750
Did someone say something?

376
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:34,590
♫Paralyzed by ancient delight ♫

377
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:41,070
♫ And riding for a fall today ♫

378
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:47,650
♫ I am dressed in style, so eager in mind ♫

379
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:53,770
♫ But furthermore distracted by you ♫

380
00:25:53,770 --> 00:26:01,130
♫ And it's like I lose myself in dreaming ♫

381
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:07,080
♫ of summer days in bloom ♫

382
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:15,200
♫ Oh, I've got no clue how I could fight that ♫

383
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:22,760
♫ All that I am is worth a dime ♫

384
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:09,870
Who are you?

385
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:15,970
I searched for you. I knew at first sight. I'm Jang Yoon Ha.

386
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:25,690
Would you like to order?

387
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:27,530
We'll order later.

388
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:28,990
Alright.

389
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:36,990
Did you change locations to do something like this?

390
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,050
It's our first meeting. Please keep your manners.

391
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:42,950
I heard you graduated elementary school here but schooled in China afterwards.

392
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:46,490
I tried investigating you, too, but I couldn't.

393
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:52,370
Since you're speaking informally, I'll do so as well.

394
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,730
You're coming on strong.

395
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,850
Who is it?

396
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:00,630
You really do things without reason. There is no logic.

397
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:03,510
You're dating someone your household is against.

398
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:07,080
You're putting on a show like this to dump me here because of him.

399
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,970
Oh should I say, to get yourself dumped?

400
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:12,920
That's not why, but that's the outcome that I want.

401
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:17,690
Don't talk about my attitude or clothes. Just say you don't like me.

402
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:21,000
Tell them that I'm rude.
-You're speaking informally when you're asking for a favor?

403
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,890
Please keep your manners. You're two years younger than me.

404
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:27,470
You're just as I thought. Pulling out our ages because you have nothing to say.

405
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:32,180
I have many things to say. You've messed with the wrong person today.

406
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,610
I'm going to tell my household that I really  like you.

407
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:42,240
I'm going to tell them that I'm going to marry you.

408
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,990
I can just say I don't want to.
-You're in a household where your words aren't heard.

409
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,130
So that's why you put on a show like this.

410
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:51,960
You act strong but you're too weak. You lack creativity.

411
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,210
Look at your state at a dining table.

412
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:00,910
You know what I hate the most in the world?

413
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:04,070
Becoming a pushover. And another,

414
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:06,310
Being used.

415
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:11,890
-Sorry.
-Did you just realize that the world isn't so easy?

416
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:17,490
Why would you be using a plan that isn't even possible? If you asked me sincerely, I would've listened to you.

417
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:20,250
I listen to girls' favors very well.

418
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,040
Why are you getting up?

419
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:32,090
I'm going home.
-Come out after I do. I don't want to walk with you.

420
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:35,790
Don't come into my view anymore.
-You said you were going to tell your family that you'll marry me.

421
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:39,990
What is this now? You're acting innocent now?

422
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:42,040
I was scaring you.

423
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,950
Thank you.

424
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,910
There's nothing free in this world.

425
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:10,390
Oh, Mom. Tae Jin Group's daughter is a weirdo!

426
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:15,070
She came out purposely to upset me. She even has a guy she's dating.

427
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:21,110
You thought I was just going to leave it at the water hit?

428
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:24,930
Try studying life again a little more.

429
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,610
Oppa.

430
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,950
Oppa~

431
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,360
Oppa...

432
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,790
Don't be like this. It's pathetic.

433
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:54,290
I told you I can pay for your parents' living fees if you get married to me.

434
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:57,970
To tell them not to push me around as daughter-in-law in return, was it so wrong?

435
00:30:57,970 --> 00:30:59,840
This is what that sounds like,

436
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,670
"I'll give you money so don't order me around!"

437
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:06,820
The type of guy a girl hates the most is like you.

438
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,890
You are outstanding but

439
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:11,740
your family is a nuisance.

440
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,480
Let's see...

441
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,930
Your father's furniture company. It's net profit is $36 million.

442
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:23,500
120 employees. It's a reliable company.

443
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,460
But the future isn't that bright.

444
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:29,860
Father who doesn't know how to deal with changes, he gets cheap and he's narrow-minded.

445
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:34,170
Your brother wants to work with food industry rather than furniture industry.

446
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:35,790
Did you investigate my background?

447
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:37,930
You have no charm at all.

448
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:43,010
You act like you don't know anything and count the money in your pocket.

449
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:47,540
Your father's company is too wasteful for me to invest my mind and heart into.

450
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,770
So it was not me,

451
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:53,970
but my background that you loved?

452
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:56,310
It wasn't love,

453
00:31:56,310 --> 00:32:00,150
but I liked you.. until I found out your true nature.

454
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,260
Let go me. How could you use someone's heart?

455
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:07,650
How could you easily say that you met me because of my background and not because you loved me?!

456
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:11,100
Was I the only one who looked at background? You did as well.

457
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,140
Do I have to take all the blame?

458
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,880
I was serious.

459
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,560
I was serious as well.

460
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:22,020
Son of a bitch!

461
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:29,060
Take care.

462
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:35,530
Even so, you won't be able to find a woman like me again!

463
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:40,790
I'm the best woman you can meet with your condition!

464
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:03,380
♫ Please stop coming close me ♫

465
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:10,800
♫ Please stop smiling as well ♫

466
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:16,250
♫ If I start to want you ♫

467
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:23,870
♫ It will hurt a lot ♫

468
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,700
♫ Please don’t dream of me ♫

469
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:39,300
♫ I’m also pushing you away like this♫

470
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:49,080
♫ Please stop coming close me ♫

471
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:56,790
♫ Because your warmth will surely shake me up ♫

472
00:33:56,790 --> 00:34:04,550
♫ As much as I’m holding back from you ♫

473
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:14,020
♫ It may hurt but I have to hold back from you ♫

474
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,230
Yeah.

475
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,830
You sure are holding it in well. Not talking and all.

476
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:34,140
Mom

477
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:40,300
Ma'am, this is Chang Soo!

478
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:44,000
Oh, so you're with Joon Gi. Are you well?

479
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,300
Come by sometime. I'll make you your favorite clam noodles.

480
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,440
Yes, I will come by to eat some noodles soon.

481
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,600
Is there something wrong?

482
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:55,370
There's nothing wrong. It's been over two months since you've come home.

483
00:34:55,370 --> 00:35:00,330
Since you say you're busy every time I call you, I tried picking a good time to call you, but looks like it's a bummer again.

484
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:02,930
No, it's not bummer but super best!

485
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:05,100
You were able to hear my voice, too.

486
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,760
Yeah, it's the super best.

487
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,350
Chang Soo, thank you.

488
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:14,920
For what, Ma'am?
- Just thank you.

489
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:19,270
Joon Gi, then work well with Chang Soo.

490
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:25,500
I'll take no news as good news. Your mom and dad will be fine. Fighting!

491
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,540
Let's go ride our bicycles.

492
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:35,170
You really are out of the blue.

493
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:38,860
Such bad timing.

494
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:42,720
Even if they're friends, it should be uncomfortable since he's in a higher position in the company.

495
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,920
How can I never get the right time?

496
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,860
Ahjumma.

497
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,950
Yes, you came back?

498
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,610
Yes.

499
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,310
Please get me something cool.
-Yes.

500
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:05,370
The atmosphere doesn't seem too good.

501
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:08,750
There's information that the prosecution has started an internal investigation.

502
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,170
Was there ever a good atmosphere?

503
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:15,680
We're always nervous. There's nothing definite.

504
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:24,070
If it rains, we should get hit by the rain.

505
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:27,350
But prepare an umbrella.

506
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:31,970
Hong Nam Dong, Madame Kim.

507
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:37,070
Did you just go back home, President, this early?

508
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,940
I got it.

509
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:45,450
Chief Song... You should tell me beforehand if he's coming or not!

510
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,080
I'm watching out for you since if I call the President personally, it'll cause problems.

511
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:55,350
What goes around should come back around.

512
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:58,100
What should we do about dinner?

513
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:02,850
My ahjusshi isn't coming today so let's have dinner together.

514
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:06,760
-That's just...
-Is there a problem at your home? Always going home at the exact time.

515
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,480
My husband is home alone.

516
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,880
He can't eat when he's alone?

517
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,520
If he has such manners, what are you going to do?

518
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:18,910
There's some dried yellow corvina fermented in barley. Should I prepare it so you can have it for dinner and go?

519
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:23,630
Grill some meat and make it into a birthday party kind of meal. Then you can go.

520
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:24,490
Yes.

521
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:26,400
Ahjumma.

522
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:30,520
Isn't this pretty?

523
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:38,750
I have others, too. You might become so shocked if you see the others.

524
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:48,860
Bazarr preparation is almost ready and the vice president has provided sponsorship.

525
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,320
Prepare the plane so I can go to Hae In.

526
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,860
Yes.

527
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:59,530
Vice President, please schedule a plane so the Madame can go to New Jersey quickly.

528
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:03,250
Really? How could she act like that at an arrange date?

529
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:06,650
She made her parents look bad.

530
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:09,910
There are rumors that she isn't their biological daughter.

531
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:14,770
When she was pregnant with Yoon Ha, she didn't come out to meetings as often.

532
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:20,110
Oh my, that necklace looks really beautiful.

533
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:23,860
Oh my, she's coming.

534
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,750
Looks like everyone has gathered together.

535
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:28,430
Oh my, it seems like you've gotten younger.

536
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:34,160
Thank you for coming to preparation meeting even though you're busy.

537
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:39,250
The products that the Vice President sent are all stacked over there.

538
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:45,440
Our Vice President is helping out once again since it's his mother's bazaar preparation meeting.

539
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,590
There are rumors that Kyung Joon is a very loyal son.

540
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:52,300
He must be a guy who's very nice to women.

541
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:56,260
Even if he's divorced, there must be women going after him.

542
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:59,200
Please tell him to be careful.

543
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,500
Ah...

544
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,770
Did you hear about our kids' arranged meeting today?

545
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:08,210
Not yet.
-I heard she has a man she's dating.

546
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:11,570
She must be the type to clearly express her opinion.

547
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:14,780
There's no reason for her to show off, though.

548
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:17,660
She's usually docile... I wonder why she did that.

549
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:21,530
It looks like she didn't take after her mother.

550
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:25,560
Truthfully, it's rare to find someone like Chang Soo who is so straightforward.

551
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,660
A girl like Yoon Ha is normal.

552
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:31,620
Acting like she listens when in front of people but rebelling from behind the curtains.

553
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:35,530
It must be great for you since your child is so smart.

554
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:40,610
She's really going after me. Even bringing up Kyung Joon.

555
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:49,970
My dad made this place. I came with him when I was 5.

556
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,920
Speaking as if you inherited it from the dead.

557
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:58,070
Okay, one, two, go!

558
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:04,740
♫ That big apple took a bite out of me ♫

559
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:08,210
♫ Never the same after living in the city ♫

560
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:11,680
♫ You got to tell yourself... You can do you can do ♫

561
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:18,630
♫ Now now when I met you. How how could I let you
Into all my nooks. So into your looks ♫

562
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:22,210
♫ Bet you’re probably crazy. Bet I’m being rolled ♫

563
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:25,950
♫ Bet you’re probably perfect for me. Bet you’re made of gold ♫

564
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:29,540
♫ All the girls from Harlem to Wall Street ♫

565
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:32,990
♫ That Big Apple took a bite out of me ♫

566
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:36,400
♫ Crushed dreams from Chelsea to Queens ♫

567
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,670
♫ That Big Apple took a bite out of me ♫

568
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:53,880
♫ Doo-doo Doo-doo Doo I wonder what you are
Doo-doo Doo-doo Doo I wonder what you are ♫

569
00:40:53,880 --> 00:41:00,960
♫ Doo-doo Doo-doo Doo I wonder what you are
Doo-doo Doo-doo Doo ♫

570
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,130
♫ Doo doo doo doo ♫

571
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:11,460
Yeah!

572
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:18,200
She came with a plan from the very beginning. She was planning to use me.

573
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:24,270
You know that the one thing I cannot forgive is when people use me when I'm trying to be nice to them.

574
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:26,940
Would I be able to do it?

575
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:30,530
When I start to doubt myself, others doubt me as well.

576
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:34,070
This is the worst day. I got put down by Hyung and that girl.

577
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:38,110
I'm at a loss. I don't want to be a son of rich empty headed man.

578
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:41,380
If you want to crumble over something like that, then don't have desires.

579
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:45,770
I'm sorry. You were spending some romantic time with Min Jung.

580
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:48,990
We broke up. I met with her to tell her that.

581
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:51,940
How unexpected. I thought you were going to marry her.

582
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:54,460
It's not easy to find a girl with a background and a face like hers.

583
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:57,970
She's too good for me. And too kind as well.

584
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:01,050
You're purer than you look.

585
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:03,690
That's why I like you.

586
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,280
Let's go. No more childish talking.

587
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,800
You are indeed my loyal subordinate!

588
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,600
No, friend.

589
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:28,320
Here.

590
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,710
Oh, thank you, every time.

591
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:34,970
It's no problem. If you need something, please ask me without hesitation.

592
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:40,190
When you first came here, you were all over the place. Now you're diligently and efficiently doing your work.

593
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:43,540
I'm someone who gets better with time.

594
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:48,010
Is Deputy Choi Joon Gi coming back?

595
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:50,540
He's dispatched here until the market revives again.

596
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:53,670
If not, why would they send the best brain of planning department to work here?

597
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:56,650
The Director probably caused a problem and he came to fix it.

598
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:59,760
Where does he sit then?

599
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,260
Over there.

600
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:05,490
But, Miss Lee Ji Yi, are you close with Deputy Choi?

601
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,990
You aren't? That's why you asked me?

602
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:10,490
That's right. We aren't close.

603
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:14,200
Don't try to become close with him. You can be close to me.

604
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,900
But if Deputy Choi wants to be close to me, I can't do anything about it.

605
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:23,110
Why would he want to be close to a part-timer? You seem to understand your position but go astray.

606
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:26,680
-Deputy Choi isn't a snob like that.
-And I am?

607
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:30,410
That's....I can't answer that.

608
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:35,330
Ah, she...

609
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:45,000
Do you know where I can find some cereal?

610
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,380
Thank you.

611
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,450
Ma'am.

612
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:02,470
Ma'am, I'm looking for some cereal. Do you know where I can find some...

613
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:03,480
cereal?

614
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,900
Ce-Ce...?

615
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:07,420
Could you wait for a second? Where is the cereal?

616
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:10,400
Cereal? Over there.

617
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,560
Ah...cereal?

618
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,540
Yes. Cereal.

619
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:19,650
Left. Left. Left.

620
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:21,780
-Left!
-Left?

621
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:25,570
Left! Straight! Left and straight!

622
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:27,980
Straight? Ah, okay!

623
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:30,610
Left and straight? Okay, thank you!

624
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:32,670
Thank you!

625
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:38,910
When communicating with a foreigner, the most important thing is to be tactful.

626
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:40,930
Don't avoid them next time, okay?

627
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:42,060
Thank you.

628
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:43,110
What is your name?

629
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:45,690
It's Lee Ji Yi.

630
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:48,200
It's Lee Ji Yi even when backwards.

631
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,460
My name is Lee Ji Yi. If you read it backwards, it's still Lee Ji Yi.

632
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:01,590
The person I love is Choi Joon Gi. If you read it backwards, it's Gi Joon Choi!

633
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:03,420
Gi Joon!

634
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,870
I'm going to sleep. Wake me up when we get home.

635
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:16,460
Okay.

636
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:21,600
Turn off the music.

637
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:31,060
"It's been 5 years since we established this Unjeong Foundation.

638
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:34,890
To everyone who came to celebrate such a meaningful day,

639
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:37,240
I give you a word of gratitude.

640
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,880
For the past 5 years—

641
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,190
Did you find out where Yoon Ha is?

642
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:44,310
She's at home.

643
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:46,220
When can the plane take off?

644
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:49,190
They said it's not possible.

645
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:52,350
-Why?
-Apparently, it was on the President's orders.

646
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:57,880
Then look for an airplane ticket. The fastest one to New Jersey. When can we go?

647
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:02,570
I already looked. It's not possible.

648
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:05,700
Did the president block all my funds?

649
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,400
Yes.

650
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:24,250
Oldest younger brother.

651
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:25,930
Yeah?

652
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:28,740
Did you fight with brother-in-law?

653
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,140
No.

654
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:32,590
Then please speak nicely to him.

655
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:36,770
If Tae Jin Group stops advertising with our company, our company will be ruined.

656
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:40,130
I suddenly heard the advertisements stopped.

657
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,590
Saying it was the company's course of action.

658
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:44,810
Don't worry. I'll make sure to talk to him.

659
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:49,580
After mother passed away, you became like our mother.

660
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:53,600
Alright. Go home.

661
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,960
How embarrassing.

662
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,060
What is?

663
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:04,110
Life.

664
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:21,960
He's eating by himself.

665
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:26,020
It's when he's the most happy.

666
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:28,080
Welcome back.

667
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:31,380
How did it go today?

668
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:34,810
-The thing is...
-Go to your room.

669
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,410
I'm sorry.

670
00:47:57,410 --> 00:47:59,260
Go.

671
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:06,050
When will everything be restored?

672
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:09,400
You're so pathetic.

673
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,360
Why do you seem so surprised?

674
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,840
I'm sorry.

675
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:29,670
You saying sorry is even worse.

676
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:33,550
Let me hear what you did wrong.

677
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:38,320
Are you dating someone we don't know? I heard you have a man.

678
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:44,770
I didn't say that I had a man. That guy was the one who-

679
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:53,200
I didn't want to have an arranged meeting. I did everything you wanted me to until now.

680
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,950
But I didn't want to anymore. And I decided to act upon your words

681
00:48:56,950 --> 00:49:00,470
that you'll make me stop having arranged meetings if I get rejected again.

682
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:02,820
I decided to rebel and-

683
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:15,110
I'm no longer a child and I think using violence when I did something wrong is not right.

684
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:20,480
Do you know why you creep me out?

685
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:25,030
You were hit. You should cry if you have been hit.

686
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:30,910
If you've been hit, you should shrivel up. If you've been hit, you should be sad. If you got hit, you should become obedient!

687
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:34,880
You may not remember.

688
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:40,460
But when I was first hit, I cried. When I was hit again, I shriveled up.

689
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:45,950
When I got hit the 5th time, I became sad. When I was hit the 10th time, I became obedient.

690
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:48,390
But while I was changing, you remained the same.

691
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:52,410
Nothing works out because of you.

692
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:57,380
Do you know what kind of day I had to endure today? It was horrible, I couldn't handle it,

693
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:01,590
and just when I was holding down what I couldn't handle, you lit a fire over it.

694
00:50:01,590 --> 00:50:05,290
You're always like that! When I lay prone, you strike!

695
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:06,680
It was like that since you were born!

696
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:10,890
It's not my fault that Father went off to other women when I was born.

697
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:14,970
You always think that every problem in your life is my fault.

698
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:18,610
To the one whose most weak and naive in this household,

699
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:21,280
you let all your emotions out

700
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,620
and say that you were trying to discipline me because you love me. But...!

701
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:27,250
But that's very cowardly!

702
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:28,930
Because you are like this,

703
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:31,380
I am put off by you.

704
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:36,300
You always try to win against everyone. Whether it's parents or siblings.

705
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:40,340
I can't even make a sound in this house. How can I win against someone?

706
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:44,290
I'm trying my best to live in this house as well.

707
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:47,730
Why would you work hard? You can just leave by getting married!

708
00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:50,280
I'm just waiting for you to get married.

709
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,310
I'll think I've done my role as a parent when you get married.

710
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:58,120
But, it has to be a marriage that we want!

711
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:11,040
I can do everything as you wish

712
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,570
but I will marry on my own accord.

713
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:17,650
Since you were born in this house, there is nothing you can do by yourself.

714
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:20,920
But you gain a lot of benefits instead.

715
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,030
Did you forget?

716
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:24,480
How could I forget?

717
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,240
That's how you're living as well.

718
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:31,890
Look at you. You grab at a weakness any chance you get!

719
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:35,860
Stop hitting me today.

720
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:39,620
I think I received enough punishment for what I've done.

721
00:51:58,010 --> 00:51:59,560
I'm still at the department store.

722
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,770
Is there something wrong?

723
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:03,970
No,

724
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:05,790
I just started to miss you.

725
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:09,210
Looks like you need vitamins if you miss me.

726
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:12,160
A vitamin for the soul~

727
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,340
Forget it.

728
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:18,050
Come here. I'll give you a vitamin shot.

729
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:19,400
What do you want to eat?

730
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:25,140
You would know what I want to eat if you think about it just a little.

731
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:26,800
Okay.

732
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,650
It's gabmok. (Korean fortune telling word)

733
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:53,410
It's even the best among the gabmok.

734
00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:56,080
It's fate of a king.

735
00:52:56,080 --> 00:53:00,960
It's better if you avoid someone that has this kind of fate.

736
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,320
It's someone who takes away other people's luck.

737
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,920
It'll spark conflict among men in the household.

738
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:12,410
It'll send all the men in his household out since it's such a strong fate.

739
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:18,500
That's why he started a different lifestyle after I gave birth.

740
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:21,770
Moreover, if you are with

741
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:26,200
your youngest daughter, nothing will ever work out.

742
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:29,420
Since your youngest daughter has a superior fate,

743
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:32,540
you'll be devoured.

744
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:37,000
There is a need to hold her down.

745
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,530
You look very beautiful when you sit in front of a piano.

746
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:57,810
I'm so happy that you are my son.

747
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:01,420
Please accept Father.

748
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:03,880
Don't try to understand him.

749
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:07,120
I know.

750
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:10,100
I told them to prepare a plane so I can go see Hae In tomorrow.

751
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:11,490
Yes.

752
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:14,720
Please get So Hyun married off before Yoon Ha.

753
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:19,100
It's impossible for her since her engagement got cancelled. She just needs to date.

754
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:21,140
Yoon Ha doesn't have any shares in the company.

755
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:24,450
Marriage is all we can give to her.

756
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:26,950
I think Yoon Ha would be better in the company than So Hyun.

757
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:30,790
Not her. She'll try to overcome you since she has a strong personality.

758
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:33,720
Prowling about you provoking you,

759
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,250
I think Ye Won alone is enough.

760
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:38,330
It's the same for me whether it's one or two.

761
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:40,730
I think Yoon Ha has what it takes to work in the company.

762
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:42,300
No.

763
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:48,050
Leave the girls to me. Just focus on making Taejin Group yours.

764
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:53,240
That's my dream and purpose in life. You'll do it for me, right?

765
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,700
Don't put your purpose in life on me.

766
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:58,690
But instead on your life.

767
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:05,380
My life doesn't exist in this life.

768
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:22,440
Miss Lee Ji Yi?

769
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,890
Why are you here so late?

770
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:27,850
After hearing you're dispatched here again,

771
00:55:27,850 --> 00:55:29,830
I was cleaning your desk.

772
00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:33,470
Thank you. You're as bright and hardworking as always.

773
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:35,890
But why are you here this late?

774
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:37,280
I'm turning over a new leaf.

775
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,770
I thought I should at least sit in my seat beforehand.

776
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:44,540
As expected of you, Deputy. Now that you're here everything will work out!

777
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:45,850
I'll do my best.

778
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:47,650
Please take care of me as well.

779
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:50,300
It looks like you were on your way out, so go.

780
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:53,970
What about you, Deputy?

781
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,290
Please check the fish market corner as well.

782
00:55:58,290 --> 00:56:00,040
Yes, sir.

783
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,690
-Miss Lee Ji Yi.
-Yes?

784
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:07,370
Weren't you on your way out?

785
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:09,310
Yes.

786
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:16,310
Miss Lee Ji Yi.

787
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:17,300
Yes?

788
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:18,530
You can go now.

789
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:20,630
Yes.

790
00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:28,680
What do you think is the problem with the Premium Food Market?

791
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,150
Yes?

792
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:32,020
You keep saying "Yes."

793
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:33,970
Yes.

794
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:40,230
I'll go now. I think I'm bothering you.

795
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,560
Go. I'll go with you.

796
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:42,710
It's okay!

797
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:45,570
Then I'll really become a bother to you.

798
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:47,900
I don't like being a nuisance.

799
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:48,820
Let's go out together.

800
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:50,820
Yes.

801
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:05,450
You've worked hard.

802
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:07,540
Thank you.

803
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:18,830
Hey!

804
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:21,720
Oh, oh!

805
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:24,520
It's your favorite chicken feet and soju.

806
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:25,740
Hey.

807
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:28,770
What do you mean I like chicken feet and soju?

808
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:47,540
Excuse me, Deputy!

809
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:50,840
This is my friend. She works with me.

810
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:53,230
Hello.

811
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:55,750
Then we'll see each other tomorrow.

812
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:59,050
Yes, goodbye.

813
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:02,410
What the heck? Why do you scan people up and down?

814
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:04,640
Hey.

815
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,300
Do you know me?

816
00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:18,700
They say it's fate if you coincidentally meet three times.

817
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:21,680
I don't believe in fate.

818
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:24,900
I only choose.
