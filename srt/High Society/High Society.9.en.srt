1
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,480
I have thought about it...

2
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,920
You are the Deputy Manager.

3
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,960
Isn't there a problem with policies if the Deputy Manager

4
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,280
personally brings this to me?

5
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,500
Let's keep our policies from now on. Wouldn't it be better?

6
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,600
I'll just accept it this time.

7
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,260
Why aren't you saying anything?

8
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,400
From whose perspective should I tell you?

9
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,200
Friend... or employee?

10
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,220
Friend.

11
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,840
Am I really a friend to you?

12
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,720
Forget it. You may leave.

13
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,300
You're still messing with my sincerity.

14
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,780
I know why you're mad.

15
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:40,660
It's because your partner can also become my partner.

16
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,200
That's why I didn't tell you. Because I know you.

17
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,840
I know a lot about you, Chang Soo.

18
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,500
Saying that you like me and that you trust me,

19
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,120
you didn't have assurance in yourself. Expressing myself would reassure you.

20
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,080
I predicted these actions.

21
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,020
Yoo Chang Soo is immature, just as I thought.

22
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,800
High Society ep 9

23
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,660
Is it like that?

24
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,180
What?

25
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,620
I asked you what relationship do you have with the chaebol part-timer.

26
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,600
You should've told me that you guys were dating.

27
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,040
I don't know what you're talking about.

28
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,400
Hey, search the news.

29
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,220
You and the chaebol daughter's romantic love story is causing a frenzy.

30
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,840
The movie becomes reality?
The daughter of a chaebol and an ordinary man's romance topic!

31
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,680
I will tell you directly.

32
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,440
The chairman is against it.

33
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,900
This is something I predicted.

34
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:24,280
If you tell me what you want, I'll try my best to make it happen.

35
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,680
I believe you have it wrong.

36
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,200
If there's something I want, that means I have a motive...I think you're thinking too much about a man-woman relationship.

37
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,280
The daily news...Yoon Hae Joon reporter...you were high school classmates, right?

38
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,000
Yes.

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,460
Yoon Reporter was the first to release Jang Yoon Ha Team Leader's market part-timing article.

40
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,000
Don't you have a relation?

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,680
Since he's a friend, I can talk about the girl I'm dating, and my friend is a reporter.

42
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,240
If it's article-worthy, he has the right to release the article.

43
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,620
If you call that a motive, it's not very convincing,

44
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,600
and makes me uncomfortable.

45
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,960
Yoon Ha wants to become independent from the household and

46
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,180
I...am supporting her.

47
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:06,040
That article...it became a clue to us.

48
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,060
Before that, through that article, I would have no gain.

49
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,600
Maybe if it was an important announcement, I don't know.

50
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,200
Then... I will leave now.

51
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,160
Yes.

52
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,580
You are really something! The daughter of Tae Jin Group,

53
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,140
I heard she's the part-timer you're dating... You chose really well.

54
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:42,860
I'm just dating her, it's not like we're announcing marriage. It's not much.

55
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,660
Joon Gi, do whatever you can to hold on to Tae Jin Group's daughter.

56
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:51,080
Then even if you can't become partners, you can become friends.

57
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,480
Don't forget that I kept giving you love advice!

58
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,280
If you are done speaking I will leave.

59
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,980
Let's get along, Joon Gi.

60
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,880
Chang Soo will probably become a tied-down spirit now.

61
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,200
I should go to rub it in.

62
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,740
So that he can't mess around like this ever again.

63
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,440
Were you really born to ruin my life?

64
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,040
The movie (Notting Hill) comes to reality?
The daughter of a chaebol and an ordinary man's romance topic!

65
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,320
While knowing I was always on SNS,

66
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,740
you took the focus issue for yourself, and now you even released hot commentary!

67
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,320
Didn't you release these articles on purpose?

68
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,920
Where are you going? I'm not finished talking.

69
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,340
To meet Joon Gi. How shocked would he be?

70
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,100
You've really opened up.

71
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,900
When I said they were like models, you looked down on me.

72
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,020
You all acted high and mighty with your commoner?

73
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,720
He is more handsome, taller, and more charming than a model.

74
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,880
Don't compare him to the guys you're meeting.

75
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,700
Do you think that guy is dating you out of true love?

76
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,610
I met him while working. He didn't know whose daughter I was,

77
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:18,400
When I first met him, status and condition, this guy had it better.

78
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,420
You're not going to marry him anyway.

79
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,380
You used him to raise your image.

80
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,340
If he asked, I was going to, but

81
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:30,280
if it keeps going like this...I guess I have to ask him to marry first.

82
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,040
What kind of man are you?

83
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,460
I am sorry.

84
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,460
Didn't I tell you not to let her drink alcohol?

85
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,340
I am sorry.

86
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:54,600
But committing for a bit...I think it would be best to let her.

87
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,480
Let her commit for a bit?

88
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,960
Since you're like this, she can't come to her senses!

89
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,020
In that condition, what is she going to do? You, too!

90
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,040
Stop working here from now on.

91
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,860
What?

92
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,800
I told you before, if she drinks again, I would put the blame on you.

93
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,360
Tell her to come to my study.

94
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,820
Since the mother is like that, all the children are like that!

95
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,680
Let's divorce.

96
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,780
I can't live with a person like you.

97
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:40,360
I think about it hundreds of times every day.

98
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,500
I think I can do it now.

99
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,990
I'm tired of hating you.

100
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,260
Miss.

101
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,560
Why are you so surprised?

102
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,680
I must have been in deep thought.

103
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,480
Is he looking for me?

104
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,320
Yes...

105
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,240
I guess while living my life, holding in my emotions became a habit.

106
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:24,780
When I drink, I start yelling my thoughts

107
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,420
and sleep peacefully.

108
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:31,640
But when I wake up, it's scary.

109
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,660
Miss.

110
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,460
What?

111
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:42,300
If deceased Mother...saw your state right now...

112
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,440
Mom...

113
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,480
Father...

114
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,900
I miss you.

115
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:58,420
When you were 20 years old, how wise and beautiful you were...

116
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,900
Do you remember it?

117
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,200
It was so long ago, I don't remember well.

118
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,220
I am not talking about a long time period.

119
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,100
I was already dead long ago.

120
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,300
I don't know if I had days like those.

121
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,700
Now I have to go to my husband

122
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,700
and say I did wrong.

123
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,840
Gyeong Joon...have your forgotten him?

124
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:38,360
How could I forget him? Even if I die, I can't forget.

125
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,780
There is a lot to report to you.

126
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:46,600
Gyeong Joon's accident has a few reports from unknown places,

127
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,520
and Yoon Ha is on the newspaper.

128
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:55,680
Gyeong Joon and Yoon Ha are always tied together.

129
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,640
With that said,

130
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,440
if my feelings towards Gyeong Joon were bright and warm,

131
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,960
then my feelings towards Yoon Ha...maybe it's guilt...

132
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:12,340
they are heavy and dark. I also get mad at myself.

133
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,260
Today,

134
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:19,020
I think this will be the last report I ever give to you in this household.

135
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,720
What are you talking about?

136
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:28,020
If you drank again, I was told I would be blamed.

137
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,420
After getting off of the airplane,

138
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,500
I checked all of Gyeong Joon's activities...

139
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,560
After seeing Chairman I will hear your report.

140
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,040
Miss, please stop it.

141
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:52,470
Why did this kind of article come out? What were you doing instead of blocking this article?

142
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,470
I apologize.

143
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,470
Block the article!

144
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:58,690
Nowadays, for articles that have already came out, it'll simply cause a headache.

145
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:02,580
Since this kind of article is like a celebrity gossip article, the interest of people is high.

146
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:06,170
Even if we try to get rid of it, it will just become suspicious chaos.

147
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:09,700
Even so, there has to be a certain degree!

148
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,810
How did the fear-giving go?

149
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:18,030
Well, with the favor of breaking up with Jang Team Leader, I offered him whatever he wanted,

150
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,200
but he said it made him uncomfortable.

151
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,620
It seems he has big ambitions and is intelligent.

152
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:26,430
Since an article came out, I don't know how else it would have been released.

153
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,170
Aigoo.

154
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,980
Hey. Why do these articles keep coming out?

155
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:40,050
It's fun. You have no idea how many times I clicked on it.

156
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,730
I uploaded it to my SNS too.

157
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,250
You too, really!

158
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:48,250
But Deputy Choi and you standing together really was complete art!

159
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,130
But Deputy Manager must be a bit flustered.

160
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,330
Right?

161
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:57,630
Right! Even with me, do you know how many people are talking?

162
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,510
Is she Cinderella? She doesn't know men well.

163
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:05,140
But even though this happened, Joon Gi hasn't even contacted me.

164
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:09,570
Rather than calling you, he's probably busy greeting people in other places.

165
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:13,450
The company has been chaotic because of Deputy Choi.

166
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,950
I have to go in to meet the Manager.

167
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,990
Okay.

168
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:37,940
Are you okay?

169
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,320
I'm fine.

170
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:50,210
Let's meet later. When we meet, let's discuss the situation.

171
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,280
I got it.

172
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,910
Fighting today, too!

173
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,750
Manager.

174
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,160
Oh, Miss Lee Ji Yi, sit down.

175
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,980
What's up?

176
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,970
I'm going to quit.

177
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:14,620
Oh no. Oh no! You can't!

178
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,620
There's so much air trapped in your head. What are you going to do, Miss Lee Ji Yi?

179
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,680
What?

180
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,610
Just because your friend and boyfriend are chaebols, are you a chaebol? Why are you quitting?

181
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,670
You're going to be washed away in the Nakdong River!

182
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,420
I found another job.

183
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,450
What job?

184
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:30,140
I've decided to work at Yoon Ha's company.

185
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,770
What's so different about there and here that you're going there?

186
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,330
There's a difference in the pay.

187
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,080
Really? Then you should go of course.

188
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,590
Oh, they said I would be receiving pay in salary.

189
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,310
Then are you a part-timer there, too?

190
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:42,010
No! I'm a full-timer.

191
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:46,790
That's too much! What do they think you know how to do?

192
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,860
You know how to do a lot, of course. A ton.

193
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:55,680
Still, you're going to get a lot of stress from having to work under a friend.

194
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,520
It's not working under her, she said it's an equal level.

195
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,710
That's what they say but will that really happen?

196
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:06,280
I know right. I'm going to try to work there, and if it doesn't work out I'll let you know.

197
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:10,210
To me? This isn't the end, but you're going to meet me again?

198
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:11,740
Of course!

199
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:15,700
Oh! Miss Lee Ji Yi has loyalty!

200
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,000
I'll continue working here for this week. Until you find a replacement.

201
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,070
You can just quit. I can find a replacement.There's so much you'd have to prepare for to work at a new company.

202
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,810
Thank you, Manager!

203
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:28,560
Ah, wait.

204
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,210
Tell me your secret.

205
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:36,140
What do I have to do to meet two chaebols that are so hard to see even once in real life?

206
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,610
That's why I also kept wondering why it happened to me.

207
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,130
After you thought about it...?

208
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,890
Kindness. Because I'm kind, I think I've been blessed!

209
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:48,530
That's nonsense. Then my mom would be meeting and going out for drinks with chaebols all her life!

210
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,480
Your mom likes to drink?

211
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,780
She does. To the point that it makes me crazy. That's why I still can't get married.

212
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,090
I thought you didn't want to get married, I see it's because you can't?

213
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,820
You caught me!

214
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:04,180
Now, even if you break up with Director, it wouldn't be the end.

215
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,680
You must be busy.

216
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,930
Give me a cup of tea.

217
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,550
Bring a cup of coffee here.

218
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,920
You're not drinking?

219
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,490
I drank earlier after exercising.

220
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:30,120
Joon Gi, that guy, he's really something.

221
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,170
Did you know, too? That he was dating Taejin Group's daughter?

222
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:37,910
I guess you didn't know since you said you were meeting again.

223
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:40,690
Did you get backstabbed?

224
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:45,000
If you pay close attention, it seems like you have a lot of interest in Joon Gi.

225
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,970
I heard Taejin Group's daughter was our department store's part-timer.

226
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:55,390
I heard she's friends with the part-timer you dated. Hey, is the girl you dated also the daughter of a rich family?

227
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:58,040
You have too many questions, Hyung.

228
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,310
When people get old, I heard the first symptom is too much talking.

229
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,550
Is this your doing?

230
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,310
Suspicious corporate card use?
-You used the corporate card for gain?

231
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,570
You went to a dermatologist?

232
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:20,060
Wow, you also bought a luxury bag. Did you buy a woman's bag?

233
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:24,190
Hyung, sister-in-law must scold you a lot. Doesn't Dad hate this kind of thing?

234
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,110
Hey.

235
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,840
Yes, Dad?

236
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,870
Hyung is here.

237
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,380
I got it.

238
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,690
Hyung, Dad called you earlier. You didn't answer?

239
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:45,700
What do you mean didn't answer? I couldn't because I was in a meeting, of course.

240
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:50,270
Ah, I really don't like it when you're scolded by Dad.

241
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,390
You should go. Dad told you to go to his office.

242
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,290
Wife

243
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,050
Is it sister-in-law? Why aren't you answering?

244
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:07,430
Still, getting hit first is better.

245
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:10,850
Ah, I really don't like it when you get scolded by sister-in-law.

246
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,870
Stop it.

247
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:15,670
You're a sly player.

248
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:18,270
When we were young, you were also a player in telling on me to Father.

249
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,860
It's because you'd hit me whenever mom and dad weren't looking, of course.

250
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:26,900
In any case, what should you do? Your trusted friend backstabbed you.

251
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,080
I told you to be careful of him.

252
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,800
Doesn't he know a lot of your weaknesses?

253
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,980
You can't get rid of him, you can't keep him close, you must be suffering.

254
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,590
He probably has a lot more of Hyung's weaknesses.

255
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,830
I ordered him once.

256
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:02,550
I should go. I have an appointment. Eat lunch and continue working.

257
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:18,600
Isn't your lunch break short? Can we go out like this?

258
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,980
I quit today.

259
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,810
Good job.

260
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:29,150
But what should we eat for lunch today? I want to eat spicy rice cakes.

261
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,930
Is that childish?

262
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:33,650
Don't say the word childish in front of me ever again.

263
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:36,930
I dislike spicy rice cakes. Let's eat meat.

264
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:39,200
I don't really feel like it,

265
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,520
But I'll eat it for you.

266
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,230
Mmm, it's delicious.

267
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,200
The water kimchi is good too.

268
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,740
Are you the girl that said she didn't feel like eating meat?

269
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,170
You have to go back to the company, don't you?

270
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:01,500
Well, after exercising a bit.

271
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,070
What a glamorous life. You don't have to worry about time and can just do whatever you want.

272
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:09,000
You should stop it, Ji Yi.

273
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,890
Something bad happened, didn't it?

274
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:16,040
I know it all just by seeing your expression. I can see your inner thoughts on your face.

275
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,240
I wonder if it's because you don't care what others think?

276
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,110
I told you to stop. Where are we going to go now?

277
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:26,840
Since I have to go to a new workplace, I was going to buy a few clothes.

278
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,860
You're going to a new workplace?

279
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,120
Where?
-Yoon Ha's company.

280
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,520
Yoon Ha said we should work together.

281
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,890
Are you saying you're going to work under her?

282
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:39,420
If you're looking at it as a workplace, then I guess I am under her.

283
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,620
Don't do it.

284
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:44,950
Just play. I'll give you money.

285
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:51,470
For things that involve us eating and living, I would like it if we both respected each other.

286
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:56,940
Do you not even have pride? Why would you work under a friend? Doesn't that make you feel bad?

287
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,360
Why would I feel bad?

288
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,260
My friend said she wants to work with me because of my capabilities and strengths. Why would I feel bad?

289
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:08,700
My salary is high, too. What exactly would I feel bad about?

290
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:13,050
Don't be like this, really. Then what does the Deputy Choi who works under his friend become?

291
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:15,140
Is that how you think of Deputy Choi?

292
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:18,630
"Even if you're my friend, you're lower than me." That makes one feel very bad.

293
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:22,440
It's not even from a stranger, but if a friend does that, then you really feel bad.

294
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,370
Hey!

295
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,580
How can you leave like this?

296
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,110
I've been holding in a lot of things because of you.

297
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:46,600
While you're meeting me, how could you nonchalantly say you went on a blind date?

298
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,990
If it's that kind of situation, it's not weird if I ask you if you're looking down on me.

299
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,390
Don't forget that I don't say those kinds of words.

300
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,820
Because I know you don't look down on me.

301
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,760
It's just that when I think about the difference between you and I,

302
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,490
I know I have to respect the different ways we think.

303
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,790
Or we'd have to break up.

304
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:14,060
That's why working under Yoon Ha–
-With Yoon Ha.

305
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,740
Working  with  Yoon Ha, you're telling me to respect it?

306
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,410
Yes.

307
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,750
I don't want to.

308
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,050
I got it.

309
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:32,080
I'm still going to work though.

310
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,960
What?

311
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:52,480
End it quietly.

312
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,210
Dated and broke up already, go with that.

313
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:57,590
I can't do that.

314
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,510
Are you refusing?

315
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,880
Yes.

316
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,200
Even if I take everything you have away from you?

317
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,830
I'm doing business so why are you interfering with my personal life?

318
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:10,830
You and I both need each other.

319
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,650
I work well.

320
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:15,430
How can I trust that you're going to work well?

321
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:18,670
I do well which is why you assign me work.

322
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,380
Trust yourself.

323
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,260
How can you not even lose to anything I say?

324
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:26,990
Having lost all the time, I know how to win.

325
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:29,090
You still can't get married.

326
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:33,800
That man hasn't said he wanted to marry me yet.

327
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,420
I want to marry him,

328
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,210
but it seems he still doesn't have those thoughts.

329
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:39,990
To you?

330
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,980
I was also the one who first said we should start dating.

331
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,840
A man—!

332
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,280
Someone who can't even approach a girl first—

333
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,540
That's why I was turned down.

334
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:53,070
He said that asking someone out is what a man should do for a woman.

335
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,480
Then I got asked.

336
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:00,760
Father, please respect me.

337
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,310
I'm happy.

338
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:08,110
Innocently, without considering who's household I'm the daughter of,

339
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:12,180
he acknowledges and likes me for who I am.

340
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,180
Please respect us.

341
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:18,620
You're not afraid of me?

342
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:22,340
How can you say everything you want to say in front of me?

343
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:27,930
You fed me, clothed me, and raised me.

344
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:32,820
Usually... you don't bite the hand that feeds you.

345
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:37,090
Of course, I have courtesy towards you.

346
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:39,870
I'm not afraid.

347
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,920
I'll talk to you later.

348
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,780
I have too much to do today.

349
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,610
You just focus on making Taejin Group yours.

350
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:40,360
That is my dream and goal.

351
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,840
Don't leave your goal upon me,

352
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,930
can't you leave it to your own life?

353
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,360
Nice shot!

354
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,270
Don't worry about hurrying up.

355
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,610
I don't worry about it.

356
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:04,210
Encountering shortages and encountering excess can happen.

357
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:08,100
With that, you learn the system of continuing to encounter excess.

358
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,370
I'm speaking with results here.

359
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:14,430
I'm managing excess now. I'm doing well.

360
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:19,230
Exactly. I'm starting to compare.

361
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,220
Ye Won's news reports always come out good.

362
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,490
Noona and I have different roles.

363
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:27,410
In our company, the number of jobs is about 5,230.

364
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:33,290
Part-time workers, the families of all of them, if you put that all together...it's on my shoulders.

365
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:37,420
I'm getting as much evaluation as there is weight on my shoulders, so don't worry too much.

366
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,210
Alright.

367
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:45,740
Occasionally, I just wonder what it'd be like if I was born unto an ordinary household and studied?

368
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,870
I've also thought about that before.

369
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:51,480
A good couple relationship, living happily;

370
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,270
but this is the life we've been given.

371
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:58,740
Exactly. You have to live the life you've been given,

372
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:03,750
But at times, I think living oppositely is good.

373
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:23,850
Are you scared? When did I call you for you to be coming now?

374
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:27,750
Why do you live like that?

375
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,920
Why won't you handle the absentee property management?

376
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,820
We have to take care of that kind of stuff quickly!

377
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:43,370
How are you raising the kids?

378
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:45,190
Did you know about the article on Yoon Ha?

379
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:50,120
You can't even manage the kids properly. Do you think you can properly play your role in this household?

380
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:54,350
If I can't do it properly, are you going to replace me?

381
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:59,670
Did you drink? Because of you, Butler Hong was fired, but you still can't come to your senses?

382
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,860
I didn't drink any alcohol.

383
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:07,420
Butler Hong is one of my people. Who are you to make him quit or not?

384
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,660
He is someone I brought from my parents' home.

385
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:13,600
When my father sent me off to marry you, he sent me Butler Hong.

386
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,100
I did it because I thought a worker needed to be fired for you to snap out of it!

387
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:20,520
Fire one of your workers first. So that you can come to your senses.

388
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,720
I can't cooperate with you.

389
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:29,780
You're so malicious. Only thinking about numbers when it comes to their child, I hate that!

390
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:32,850
Then...are you saying you really are going get a divorce or what?

391
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:36,000
I told you. I will.

392
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,180
You're not going to regret it?

393
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,870
Not at all.

394
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:43,110
I'm telling you this in advance.

395
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:45,930
There is something that's changed between you and I.

396
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:51,110
I had something I'd bet everything in my life on just to protect.

397
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:53,110
But I don't anymore.

398
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:59,550
You have no idea how scary a person, who has nothing to protect, is.

399
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:03,230
Don't touch my parents.

400
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:06,840
Don't touch my people! I will not stay still.

401
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,600
I've lived with you for over forty years.

402
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,890
Up until now, the dirty, terrible behaviors of yours,

403
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:15,850
I know all of them.

404
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,460
What would you do knowing that?

405
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:24,540
Even if making people prosper is hard,

406
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,960
ruining them is easy.

407
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:47,290
Why do you have to call me all the way to the company? I have to go exercise.

408
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:50,660
I knew your mood would be bad right now so I came.

409
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:55,610
You were backstabbed, right? What did I say? I told you to be careful of him.

410
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:58,850
I told you that when you make friends, you should make friends that are of a similar level.

411
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:00,210
Stop it.

412
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:04,220
What about Yoon Ha? She contacted you first...

413
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,780
Was she two-timing?

414
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,220
Your teasing is getting more and more harsh.

415
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:12,310
Joon Gi...do you know how sly he is?

416
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:17,910
I asked him to give me the phone number of the part-timer you're meeting, and he zipped his lips.

417
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:19,920
I can't believe you met that kind of part-timer.

418
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,110
I told you to stop, Mom. Don't touch the part-timer.

419
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:27,380
I'll get angry at you.

420
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:33,010
I haven't disappointed you with my girl problems. I do things on my own.

421
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,900
Where are you going?

422
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,240
To exercise.

423
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,490
Because my mind is cluttered.

424
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:51,680
Lee Ji Yi quit.

425
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:53,860
Give me her contact information.

426
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,810
I understand.

427
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:02,200
Do you think Chang Soo became her lifeline?

428
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:05,990
He's not that kind of kid. He treasures money too much.

429
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:08,730
We have too much, why would he treasure money?

430
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:12,300
You should stop now too. What kind of humiliation is this?

431
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,380
I can't even face my own daughter-in-law.

432
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,950
Why are you being like this to me?

433
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:19,700
You're older, so you should take care of him more. Why are you so cranky?

434
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,390
That brat needs to plead.

435
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,650
Your secretary works too slowly.

436
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:29,200
When did we ask for the contact information for her to not tell us yet?

437
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,140
What is this?

438
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:02,790
If something happens to me, find this and open it.

439
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:23,470
Oppa, lend me a book. Okay, choose one.

440
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:42,240
Wow, your safe is in here!

441
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,690
Because it's you, I'm showing it to you especially.

442
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:25,060
Do you know why I came to like you?

443
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,930
Why did you come to like me?

444
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:32,030
You had many opportunities to destroy yourself.

445
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:34,990
Plus, you have a lot of money.
- So?

446
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:39,500
But instead of destroying yourself, you decided to become better.

447
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,180
Thank you for understanding.
-Yoon Ha,

448
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:46,710
that's a great thing. Do you know how hard it is to defend your heart?

449
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:50,600
When dad was younger, he was very lively and energetic.

450
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,130
Also, he had a sense of affection. But how is he now?

451
00:32:55,810 --> 00:33:00,970
Mom? She's a very great person, but

452
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:04,020
she lost her wisdom in herself.

453
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:08,270
The heart is a skill; it can't just be your feelings.

454
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:13,020
So, you have very great skills.

455
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:15,170
Then, you're a skilled man, too, Oppa.

456
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:18,720
My skills are decreasing these days.

457
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,000
Oh yeah, there's something you need to know about me.

458
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,470
I always use my passwords as 0070.

459
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,460
Company Taejin

460
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:11,410
Yeah, Ji Yi?

461
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:15,730
Where are you?
-I was thinking about going out to meet Joon Gi.

462
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:16,990
You?

463
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:20,140
I just quit my job, and now I am going to buy clothes.

464
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:24,310
But why is your voice like that?

465
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:28,890
My mood isn't great. I fought with Jerk Director.

466
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:36,040
Is it really okay for me to go to your company?

467
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,100
Where are you?

468
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:45,080
I received it from my mother.

469
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:52,600
If I only left a business card and did not contact you, she was afraid I would seem like a person with no matters. Executive Director Jang Ye Won was.

470
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,230
Why are you trying to meet me?

471
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:57,780
Taejin Group had a few extensions not too long ago.

472
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:03,080
Madam has plans to breathe life into the group again.

473
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:08,330
Through a head hunter, Yoomin Department Store's brain of the planning team, you were recommended.

474
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:10,400
That's not very believable.
-What?

475
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,710
The only place I've been accepted to after graduating was Yoomin Group.

476
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:18,380
There's no way that the head hunter has my information. I'm still a deputy.

477
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:23,880
It's been too short of a time for a head hunter to come to know of my skills.

478
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,110
I'm sorry. My thoughts were short.

479
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:33,410
I wanted to help you choose without burden, so I spoke with an optimistic outlook.

480
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:36,950
What about a private outlook?

481
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:40,460
Executive Director Jang Ye Won is Jang Yoon Ha's older sister.

482
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:45,570
She was worrying about what kind of man Miss Jang Yoon Ha was meeting, and she wanted research on you.

483
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:51,030
She was pleased with you capabilities and she thought it would be nice to work together, which is why I made a move.

484
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:57,220
I want to know if Executive Director Jang Ye Won wants to work with me because of my capabilities, or...

485
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:01,380
if she needs new territory to take over.

486
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:07,230
She is fighting with Yoon Ha, and even if a young war becomes an old war, there is no reason for it to end.

487
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:12,600
I want you to tell me what the real motive of scouting me is.

488
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:17,790
I don't move unless I'm fully prepared.

489
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:30,310
It's okay. Tell me.

490
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:32,890
You're in the middle of a meal.

491
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:36,140
Do you know why I like eating alone?

492
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:40,030
I can focus even while I'm eating.

493
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,810
What happened with meeting Choi Joon Gi?

494
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:45,740
He seemed like he would have accepted the scouting offer if the conditions were right.

495
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:48,130
Conditions? What kind of conditions?

496
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:50,740
Probably money, right?

497
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,550
Is that so?

498
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:57,480
Then it's easier than I thought.

499
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:01,780
If Yoon Ha really marries him, then he would be of use to me,

500
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:07,530
but if not, he would't be.
-Jang Yoon Ha's Team Leader seems to be planning.

501
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:17,100
When you feel depressed, giving your eyes something else to look at is good.

502
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:21,400
Or put something in your mouth.
-Right.

503
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,900
I...keep having doubts, Yoon Ha.
-Why?

504
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,760
I'm not good at anything.

505
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:33,870
If I go into your company and people make fun of me because I got in through your support...

506
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:37,260
Then you make fun of those people.

507
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,720
Ji Yi,

508
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,070
the mind is a skill.

509
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:48,060
What?

510
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:53,620
Until now, you've had a lot of moments where you felt like your life was falling apart.

511
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:56,730
The time when your parents got a divorce,

512
00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:00,580
the time when you couldn't go to college even when everyone was going,

513
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:07,690
sometimes you couldn't rest, and even if you lived in a humid and musty rooftop room,

514
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:10,790
you didn't do that.

515
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:13,260
I didn't do that.

516
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:16,150
You protected yourself.

517
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,630
Your heart is,

518
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:21,710
in other people's words, it would be

519
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:24,780
enough to get a doctorate at Harvard.

520
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:30,730
Now that I think about it, it seems like that.

521
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:39,050
Wait, that's pretty.

522
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:47,000
You want to buy it for him, huh?

523
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,450
No.

524
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:52,730
Buy it for him then. That's love, when you keep wanting to give him something.

525
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:54,480
Are you going to buy it for him, too?

526
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,370
I can't buy it. But Jerk Director has tons of those.

527
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:02,690
I can't say I wanted to buy it for him and give it to him while bleeding or something.

528
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:04,540
But you're different.

529
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,260
You, really.

530
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:09,930
My heart is the level of a professor at Harvard.

531
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:11,670
Let's go.

532
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,430
This would really suit Deputy Choi.

533
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:22,160
Give it to me, please.

534
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,080
Hello?

535
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,830
I'm Chang Soo's mom.

536
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:39,320
Are you Lee Ji Yi?

537
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,410
Yes.

538
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,960
I know why you're mad.

539
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,730
It's because your partner can also become my partner.

540
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:02,480
You keep saying you like me.

541
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,960
You keep saying you believe in me.

542
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,970
It's because you have no assurance in yourself.

543
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:12,660
You gain assurance by expressing it.

544
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:18,030
The marriage technique you use is right, but the marriage technique I use is immoral?

545
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:33,510
Do you not even have any pride? Why are you working under a friend? Don't you feel bad?

546
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:35,570
Did you treat Deputy Choi like that up until now?

547
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:39,490
"Even though you're my friend, you're lower than me." That makes one feel really bad.

548
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:43,420
It's not even from a stranger. When it's from a friend, that makes you feel horrible.

549
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:00,560
Oh, what's up?

550
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,920
I have something to tell you.

551
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,370
Tell me now.

552
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:09,150
I want to meet up and do it. It'll only take a bit.

553
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:13,740
I only have about thirty minutes. Until I have to go meet Joon Gi.

554
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:36,020
Ahjumma! It keeps ringing.

555
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,520
Go check it out.

556
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,950
I worked out too much.

557
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:57,010
Oh my. Isn't this Joon Gi?

558
00:42:57,010 --> 00:43:01,160
This is Joon Gi, right? What are you guys going to do now?

559
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,410
You have a chaebol daughter-in-law now?

560
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:18,030
Are you sure that the President fought with his wife?

561
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:20,920
Tell it to me exactly. Wasn't she the one who suffered?

562
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:25,260
No. Lately, Madam hasn't been acting like herself.

563
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:29,160
Okay. How is Ye Won? Has she already moved in?

564
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,990
The remodeling is complete. She'll move in tomorrow.

565
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:37,450
There's a bag I've had my eye on lately. I bought one for you, too. I'll send it.

566
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:43,170
So she's saying they fought.

567
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,210
I heard you told Ji Yi to go to your company.

568
00:43:58,210 --> 00:43:59,350
Yeah.

569
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:00,630
Does that make sense?

570
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:01,660
Why not?

571
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:05,030
What department are you working in? You didn't even get proper education on that.

572
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:10,270
Do you work according to what you majored in from college? It's not like that.

573
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:13,320
I'm not giving her the job because she's my friend.

574
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,790
Then?
-She has capabilities.

575
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:17,170
What capability?

576
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:20,930
The ability to have the combination of business and emotion.

577
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:25,970
I got it.

578
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:28,900
Be nice to her. She was really excited.

579
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,230
Don't worry.

580
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:33,940
At least you take care of your girlfriend though.

581
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:40,600
Do you think Joon Gi truly likes you?

582
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:46,930
Should I tell you truthfully?

583
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:56,960
Sometimes he looks at me with a gaze that I can't understand.

584
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,510
"What am I doing right now?"

585
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:06,530
"I'm being whirled into her."

586
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:09,190
That makes me cringe.

587
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:13,240
What if...

588
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:18,120
What if Joon Gi approached you with an intention?

589
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:22,660
That would never happen. I'm the one who approached him first.

590
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:25,890
You did?

591
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:29,260
I have to go! I'm late.

592
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,030
Alright.

593
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:59,570
I'm going to be late because Chang Soo suddenly called me out to meet him.

594
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:05,080
I'm a sincere person, right? Even if I'm a bit late, I always let you know!

595
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:14,720
Aigoo. What are you going to do now?

596
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:19,500
Even if there's a difference between you two...such a big one is...

597
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:26,570
It must be someone who just likes looks like her.

598
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:30,030
Why would the daughter of a rich family work part-time?

599
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:43,620
Taejin Group Founder Jang Tae Jin 20th Anniversary Memorial

600
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:54,900
It's true.

601
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,050
Are you waiting for someone?

602
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:10,170
Yes.

603
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:15,320
She's over 170cm tall. Her bra size is a B-cup.

604
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,950
You heard that?

605
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:21,750
We men...we hear those kinds of things no matter what.

606
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:27,000
I have a lot to say. There's also many things to discuss.

607
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:31,960
And this is a gift.

608
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:38,320
This is the first time someone has given me a present so laid back.

609
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:42,850
If I make a big deal, you might think it's something amazing and refuse to accept it.

610
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:47,780
What do you think?

611
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:52,820
It's okay.

612
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:55,150
It's just "okay"?

613
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:55,960
I like it.

614
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,750
Success!

615
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,520
Give me your hand.

616
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,840
What is the thing you want to say? And what is the thing you wanted to discuss?

617
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,020
Let's take a walk.

618
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:27,740
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

619
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:32,540
You're getting so much attention and you're hearing bad things because of me.

620
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:36,790
I'm nervous. Walk properly or else you're going to fall.

621
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:38,810
I won't fall.

622
00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:44,890
The thing I want to discuss is...I found the shares and USB drive my brother has left for me.

623
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:47,520
What was in the USB drive?

624
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,200
I'm going to see it when I go home.

625
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,560
Since this isn't something that can be resolved easily.

626
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,810
What do you mean you found the shares?

627
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:58,570
After my brother disappeared,

628
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:01,430
I don't want to say that he died.

629
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:03,760
Okay.

630
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,080
I found out that my brother bought 2% of stocks under my name.

631
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:13,080
Does that make sense? Since your brother's at the company's top, if he purchases more stocks even a little bit,

632
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:17,830
it's supposed to be reported. There couldn't have been a way for him to buy it without people knowing.

633
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:22,310
Exactly...it doesn't make sense.

634
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:27,220
But it could work through a third-party.

635
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:30,700
The third-party, after your brother die—

636
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:34,230
After he disappeared, it's possible that he passed it to you.

637
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:41,060
Since I have a special relation, if stocks are purchased, it's supposed to be reported.

638
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:45,370
After your brother disappeared, if the third-party passed them to you, then it's possible..

639
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:48,750
Since everyone would've been grieving and not paying attention to that.

640
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:49,940
I guess so.

641
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:52,510
So now all you have to do is find the third-party.

642
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:55,090
Then if I do that, it's resolved.

643
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:58,180
I told you not to do that or else you'd fall!

644
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:02,390
Are you worried about me right now?

645
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:07,760
Why?

646
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,600
Do you know that you're a geum-sa-bba (easy to fall in love with quickly)?

647
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:10,990
What's that?

648
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:12,400
You don't go online?

649
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,530
I do, but not a community.

650
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:17,360
But what is it?

651
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,300
Ah, what is it!

652
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:22,460
I won't teach you. Let's go eat.

653
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:28,390
After eating, do you want to go see the company? I'm going to go to work there now. I want to look around.

654
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:57,520
Hello.

655
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:05,240
Sit down, please.
-Yes.

656
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:19,680
I already ordered to save time.

657
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,120
Yes, I'm fine with that.

658
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:35,220
I'm not a person who interferes in my son's relationships.

659
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,440
Yes.

660
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:42,120
But this time, he's being odd. He is doing things that he's never done before.

661
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:44,580
Instead of fixing things when they've gotten too far,

662
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:47,920
I thought debuting early would be best.

663
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:50,820
Yes.

664
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:57,180
You know yourself that this does not make sense?

665
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:03,900
I...would not have come out to see you if only you graduated college at least.

666
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:09,280
Mother, do you know Park Myung Soo?

667
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,720
He's a gag man (comedian).

668
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:12,680
I know.

669
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:15,120
Park Myung Soo is also a high school graduate.

670
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:19,360
But now, even after raising his academic level, he still tells people he is a high school graduate.

671
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,340
Why?

672
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:25,980
Because for Park Myung Soo, it's nice that he is a high school graduate. He has a building and his wife is also a doctor.

673
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:34,420
Mother, today, I heard very nice words from my friends.

674
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,680
She said my heart is a skill.

675
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:42,340
She said my heart is the level of a Harvard professor.

676
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:48,700
At one time, being only a high school graduate was a complex of mine, but not anymore.

677
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:52,840
This is why Chang Soo fell for you.

678
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,520
You really won't do.

679
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:01,040
I will tell you the reality for you two.

680
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,860
We will not accept a daughter-in-law like you.

681
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:07,120
Chang Soo probably won't even marry you.

682
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:12,320
I know him. He's just playing in a hormone game.

683
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,720
Yes, I understand.

684
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:20,620
Mother, I also will not marry if the guy's parents do not approve of me.

685
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:23,180
Yes. You thought well.

686
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:27,780
But Chang Soo still has not decided to marry me yet.

687
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:30,020
That means I can see him until then.

688
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:31,260
Do you not have any pride?

689
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:34,160
There is no pride in love.

690
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:38,120
Missing him is first.

691
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,700
What a leech you are.

692
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:47,320
If you really love someone, you'd be willing to step aside for him.

693
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:50,000
How much of a lesson do you want to be taught before this ends?

694
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:24,980
♫ Dressed in style, so eager in mind ♫

695
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:31,180
♫ Furthermore distracted by you ♫

696
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:38,420
♫ And it's like I lose myself in dreaming ♫

697
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:44,180
♫ Of summer days in bloom ♫

698
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:52,460
♫ Oh I've got no clue how I could fight that ♫

699
00:54:52,460 --> 00:55:00,640
♫ All that I am is worth a dime. Worth a dime. ♫

700
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:17,580
♫ This liquid lunch will not stop my punch. ♫

701
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:24,140
♫ Drunk quality to doze while I run. ♫

702
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:28,800
♫ And it's thirty nine degrees in my mind. ♫

703
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,660
Why are you coming in so late?

704
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:35,020
♫ It's thirty thousand miles more to go. ♫

705
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:36,680
Who are you?

706
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:41,740
I'm a man who moved all of Korea to hang a streetlamp for you.

707
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:47,300
♫ In dreaming of summer days in bloom. ♫

708
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:49,320
What?

709
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:58,180
♫ Oh I've got no clue how I could fight that. ♫

710
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:06,640
♫ All that I am is worth a dime. Worth a dime. ♫

711
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:14,800
There is nothing here yet.

712
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,840
The space is a bit smaller than expected.

713
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,800
I still think I have it nice.

714
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,640
I don't think the team members get a room.

715
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:25,500
You're right. They wouldn't give a room to the team members.

716
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:32,060
You have to start here and continue to go up.

717
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:34,600
Go up to where?

718
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:37,820
Don't you want a higher position?

719
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:39,760
President?

720
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:43,900
No. Once I resolve my brother's case, I'm going to leave right away.

721
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,540
My goal isn't a position.

722
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,220
Why do you look at me that way?

723
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:03,460
To me...you sometimes give me an unfamiliar gaze...did you know that?

724
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:06,440
I did?

725
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:14,120
Yes. So every time that happens, I think I have to do this.

726
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,480
I know what love is.

727
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,680
Being able to smile during a pathetic situation.

728
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:42,680
The dark reality...looking at it in a bright light.

729
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:47,780
Then you come to like the situation you're facing.

730
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,920
As I've come to like you,

731
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:56,840
you're making the dark reality fade away.

732
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:02,820
That's why...the one thing I'm cautious of...

733
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,080
You...

734
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:14,200
I think you're really different.

735
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:20,280
So you don't like that?

736
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:29,940
♫ Please don't be hurt. ♫

737
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:32,640
I didn't know back then.

738
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:38,680
That I...had already stepped over that border.

739
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:46,560
♫ As much as I am pushing you away ♫

740
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:55,220
♫ It may hurt but I have to hold back from you ♫
