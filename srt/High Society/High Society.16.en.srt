1
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:36,110
They're numbers. The ones that I've made ever since I came into the company.

2
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,400
I compared my results with yours when you entered the company,

3
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,980
I was higher. Now will you acknowledge me?

4
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,960
Choi Joon Gi turned in his resignation letter.

5
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,150
If it was something solely from your ability, I would've acknowledged.

6
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,070
What does that mean?

7
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:58,030
I'm not kind. You think about it.

8
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:26,010
♫ Please stop coming close to me ♫

9
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:33,570
♫ Because your warmth will surely shake me up ♫

10
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:41,310
♫ As much as I am holding back from you ♫

11
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:50,830
♫ It may hurt but I have to hold back from you ♫

12
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,780
Yes.
- You quit the company?

13
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,920
You already know? That's fast.

14
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,210
Why did you quit? Eating while living is the most important to you.

15
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,050
I know now.

16
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,610
I told you I was sorry,

17
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,280
and even said I was wrong, but it felt like it didn't.

18
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,840
Why?

19
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,240
Because I didn't get a punishment for my wrongs.

20
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,930
Let's not meet anymore.

21
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,750
Let's also not call each other.

22
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,250
Live healthily.

23
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:45,570
♫ Please don’t leave ♫

24
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:53,360
♫ I’m in love with you like this, too ♫

25
00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:01,010
♫ As much as I pushed you away ♫

26
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,920
♫ From the beginning, I was loving you ♫

27
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,470
High Society
Final Episode

28
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,340
The electronic sales this quarter

29
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:15,650
have stopped rising at 1.7% from last year

30
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:21,650
and the Premium Food Market is actually losing money at -.02%.

31
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:26,930
Even if we try, we're going to say 'sorry' and break up.

32
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,790
I'm like this. My heart is like this nowadays.

33
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,890
They say the heart is a skill, but

34
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,470
my skill is lacking.

35
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,940
Director Yoo Chang Soo?

36
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,780
Are you just going to leave Premium Food Market as it is?

37
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,930
Profits are declining month-by-month.

38
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,230
We're in the middle of changing the concept.

39
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,970
Did you fix the mistakes you made?

40
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:01,250
I'm not fixing it, I'm securing it.

41
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,820
What are you doing here at this time?

42
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,460
What about you? What are you doing here at this time?

43
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,400
She told me to leave early, so I left.

44
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,550
Lately that house has been a little crazy.

45
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,380
I quit my job at the company.

46
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,620
Okay, you did well.

47
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,930
I did well?

48
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:37,040
You did well. I know how hard you must have thought about it.

49
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,890
This is the first time since middle school where I decided without thinking about the consequences.

50
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,050
Even so, I did well?

51
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,980
You did well! That's why being young is good.

52
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,230
And it was possible because you don't have in-laws.

53
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,180
No matter what I said, I did well.

54
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,380
I heard you told Dad that you were coming home? He really liked it.

55
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:01,060
He was always envious of how lucky I was to always see you.

56
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,130
I'm going to look at some part time jobs. I can't just play.

57
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:09,510
Just think about it as rest and play a little.

58
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:14,070
Do you not have money? Should Mom give you some?

59
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,740
Why are you like this?

60
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,600
It's comfortable.

61
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,340
The person who initiated the Taejin Premium at Big Premium is

62
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,450
Vice President Jang Gyeong Joon.

63
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,940
Who's the Vice President now?

64
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,150
I'm sorry. It's Jang Gyeong Joon's work.

65
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:00,760
Gyeong Joon having Alimama stocks means he has foreign investments.

66
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,460
Doesn't that break international law?

67
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:07,520
He invested when he was in college and already reported it to the authorities.

68
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,900
Not criminal law but civil law.

69
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,730
The meeting with Big Super is today, right?

70
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,590
Yes. It's at 3 pm.

71
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,630
The fact that Jang Gyeong Joon has been fighting internally in the company

72
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:19,410
and his investments in Albimama have spread

73
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:23,710
to the point that the President's position is threatened.

74
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,740
I need to meet Father.

75
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,680
Unni,

76
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,370
give me some of your time.

77
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,050
Leave first.

78
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:41,020
How do Choi Joon Gi's resignation letter and my numbers relate?

79
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:45,750
Did you ask Gyeong Joon why he took you on vacation with him?

80
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:49,600
No.
- Are you afraid my words are the truth?

81
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,580
Because your illusion of him may shatter?

82
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,380
What do you gain from ruining my relationship with Oppa?

83
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,290
I'm not ruining it. I'm telling you to fix it.

84
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:01,050
I'll tell you then. About the deal between Team Leader Choi and me.

85
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:04,030
Is there even a deal?

86
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,740
I left after waiting. I have to see father first. See you at home. Gyeong Joon.

87
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,010
What brings you here, unni?

88
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,010
Did you meet Gyeong Joon?

89
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:35,430
No.
- You can't like him.

90
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,900
Why do you think he took you there that day?

91
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:42,810
Probably because he needed a witness for his disappearance.

92
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,050
If there was an accident at sea but no body was found,

93
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,380
people will be suspicious and say he didn't die.

94
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:53,080
However, if there's a witness, it's different. He used you.

95
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,910
Oppa is not that kind of person.

96
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:01,380
Whether or not he is that kind of person, confirm and tell me. I'm very curious.

97
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:07,250
I'm curious to know if the two of you will continue to be close once you find out who he really is.

98
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:11,280
In the end, you'll probably just become fodder for him.

99
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:28,310
Yes, Yoon Ha. I met everyone but you.

100
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,050
Were you that busy?

101
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,470
Yes, a bit.

102
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:35,700
I saw the broadcast. You're better in real life.

103
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,700
Oppa.

104
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,930
It's like you're avoiding me.

105
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,110
Is there something?

106
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:44,280
Nothing. Do you have time today?

107
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,120
Even if I didn't have time, if you ask to meet, I should meet with you.

108
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,710
I'm indebted to you.

109
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,490
What kind of debt?

110
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,270
Let's meet and then talk.

111
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:06,500
Currently, Gyeong Joon is a shareholder and board member of Albimama.

112
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,510
I know.

113
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,520
We can't have Gyeong Joon on our company's board any longer

114
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,850
as long as he remains on Albimama's board.

115
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,850
I know.

116
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,370
With this opportunity, take him out of Taejin

117
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:22,690
and take the 12% of Taejin shares he holds.

118
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:26,820
Do you think he'll obediently give it?

119
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,020
He came and left earlier as the representative for Albimama.

120
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:34,330
He asked about the possibility of a merger with Taejin Home Shopping.

121
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,980
Merger proceedings?

122
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,530
So what did you do?

123
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,670
I told him I'd look at it objectively.

124
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,570
I'm going to meet with Albimama.

125
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,910
Because of what Gyeong Joon did, our stocks plummetted

126
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:56,240
and our company as a whole was in danger.

127
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,500
He's the child who left the company and family for his own comfort.

128
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,510
You're going to accept a proposal from that kind of kid?

129
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:08,590
I accept everything that has to do with raising numbers.

130
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:11,310
I'd even deal with the Grim Reaper.

131
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:15,090
The proposal that Gyeong Joon came with

132
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:18,410
will become an opportunity for Taejin to take off.

133
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,920
You are Taejin's Vice President.

134
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,100
If it's for the benefit of the company, you must hold hands even with your enemy.

135
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,810
This is fundamental.

136
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:45,750
Thank you to channel managers:
nelju1998 & marykarmelina

137
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,110
Vice President Jang Ye Won

138
00:10:53,770 --> 00:11:00,740
Thank you English moderators:
pilar_velasquez, lupita311, gmtn96

139
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:22,800
Thank you to segmenters:
pilar_velasquez, kitty100, bagy, gesti_lagi, bkiss

140
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,440
Come in.

141
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,720
You're living here?

142
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,900
For the time being. You seem to have grown a lot.

143
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,820
A lot of things happened.

144
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,880
You died. I was heartbroken.

145
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,280
I was told I couldn't work when I came to the company and I was turned down here and there.

146
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,400
I survived.

147
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,240
Congratulations for surviving.

148
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,200
Since I know I can't do it well, I feel more comfortable now.

149
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,220
I really thought I'd do well.

150
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,200
Is knowing you're not good the most important thing?

151
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,360
As expected, it feels good to meet you. Words just come out.

152
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,800
But why did you avoid trying to meet me?

153
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,040
I was scared.

154
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,460
Scared of what?

155
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,340
Ye Won said so.

156
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:20,500
She said you used me as a witness for your death.

157
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,820
To block a lot of things that would come out because there was no corpse.

158
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,680
If you look at it like that, I guess.

159
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:35,720
I love you. When I thought you used me,

160
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,900
I thought that my heart, which I had just barely scraped back together, would fall apart again.

161
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,950
Why did you do that? What's with the stocks?

162
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:49,140
The USB you gave me was stolen from me right in front of my eyes.

163
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,300
Ye Won is really impressive.

164
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,220
Giving you the stocks...

165
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,740
I did it because I wanted to magnify your existence within the company.

166
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:01,740
Truthfully, 2% isn't amazing,

167
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,820
but it gives you social existence.

168
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,680
Why?

169
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,900
You should also be encouraged to learn about your reality.

170
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:13,240
You were never a part of the responsibilities that we all have as members of this family.

171
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:19,580
I thought I could escape from this place.

172
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:24,960
You escape the physical possessions, but how can you overcome these relationships?

173
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,880
The last moment I lived as Jang Gyeong Joon, I hoped you'd remember.

174
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,300
But while you talked about the man you were dating...

175
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,700
you looked happy.

176
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,540
The thoughts of disappearing came to mind, so I quit.

177
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,220
You could think like Ye Won. Then...

178
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,700
You and I would be over. It's your choice.

179
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,880
My choice is always you.

180
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,680
Thank you. The last moment...

181
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:05,180
you chose me to be the one to remember your life.

182
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:09,060
As expected of you. I didn't judge you wrong.

183
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,620
What are you going to do with Father?

184
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,320
He won't leave you alone.

185
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,600
Father loves me.

186
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,780
He will never throw me away.

187
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:24,960
That's the knot between our relationship. That's why I chose to disappear.

188
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:29,540
Unless I'm reborn, Father and I...

189
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,600
can't be separated.

190
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:40,780
Thank you to segmenters:
ukepoet, LittleMG, dudie, amypun, marykarmelina, pinoccchiokat

191
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:50,800
Thank you to Korean to English subbers:
jennyjpenny, mini_lemons, michellesays, starlightO, kdramaforlife

192
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:57,820
Mother, let's be honest with ourselves.

193
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:02,700
No matter how much parents love their children, there's no way they love them more than themselves.

194
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,360
I know about parents, too.

195
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,700
That you bet your life on me...

196
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,580
I know it was for yourself.

197
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:14,760
Because of you, there's nothing going right.

198
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,420
I want to die.

199
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,460
I hope I'll just die.

200
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:24,480
Like you said, I shouldn't have been born.

201
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,270
If I wasn't born...

202
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:31,120
you wouldn't have painful situations.

203
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:38,720
When did it all start going wrong? Marriage?

204
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:43,320
I bet everything on my husband.

205
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,860
After that, I bet everything on my son.

206
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,020
All the people I bet on abandoned me.

207
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:03,520
Life is like this, I guess. Addition and subtraction...

208
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,700
being wrong.

209
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:15,820
Thank you to Korean to English subbers:
isabelalala, chubbyricecakes, dntsmshj38, min_ji_kim, alessia_prata

210
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:24,790
Thank you to Korean to English subbers:
cherin0799, meilian, hellojonathan, dongwooned, DiaNguc, jartop, jithe

211
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:33,770
Thank you to Korean to English subbers:
thethirddino, elena_song, xnabi, jina_suh, taraism /i>

212
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,380
I think we failed.

213
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,900
I think we shouldn't have met each other.

214
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,280
What did we fail?

215
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,280
Our relationship...

216
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,260
as husband and wife.

217
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:07,000
We are both responsible for our relationship failing.

218
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,050
I always blamed you.

219
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:12,300
I hated you.

220
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,500
Our failures remained and were passed on to our children.

221
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,140
It breaks my heart.

222
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:25,840
I didn't fail. You failed.

223
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,860
We are on parallel lines.

224
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:36,160
If one of the two fail, then both fail.

225
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,500
But you say that it isn't so...

226
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,320
So, would our conversation flow?

227
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,620
I tried to do well...

228
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,420
When a steel man like you fainted, I realized that I have a position here.

229
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:50,880
If I wasn't here, it wouldn't work out for you.

230
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,400
So I tried to do well.

231
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,060
I'm getting tired of it.

232
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,040
Tired?

233
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,560
Yeah. You saying the same thing every time we meet.

234
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,220
So?

235
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,200
What is the point of this discussion?

236
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,480
The point?

237
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,380
You're not going to get a divorce and you're just going to continue living like this anyway.

238
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,240
Anything else?

239
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,920
There isn't.

240
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:24,760
The end result is the same, so why do you keep talking about it? Just live.

241
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,320
It's not just a wall. It's an indestructible wall.

242
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,560
Even if the end result is the same, the course is different.

243
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,540
Even if the course is different, even if the result is the same,

244
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,000
the attitude can be different.

245
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,300
Let's drink alcohol instead of tea.

246
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,500
No. It's not good for the heart.

247
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,840
I'll get up.

248
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,940
We must have gotten old. Change what?

249
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,500
It's lonely.

250
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,820
You're coming now?

251
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,260
Yes. Did eldest sister come?

252
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,300
She came. Talk to me first.

253
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,600
I'll change first.

254
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,540
Is it busy working for the company?

255
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,180
I can't get used to it.

256
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,800
Get used to what?

257
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,900
Garnering attention to every detail of my life.

258
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,260
Do you hate me that much?

259
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,060
Why would I hate you?

260
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:56,260
Even if you push me away, I always wanted you, Mom.

261
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,860
The reason that I lived clenching my teeth and protecting my heart,

262
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,020
that was because I wanted to be acknowledged by you, Mom.

263
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,960
But I'm not a young child anymore.

264
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,640
I don't want you as much as I did when I was younger.

265
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,690
But...when I experience really difficult situations...

266
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:19,670
I'll think of you first, Mom.

267
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:23,120
I think you're like that.

268
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:28,740
There is one thing that you should do.

269
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,460
What is it?

270
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,120
My life has been a bit hard for me.

271
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,540
I know.

272
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,800
When life gets hard,

273
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,960
people with strong hearts find the problems within themselves.

274
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,100
Mom was a weak person.

275
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:52,460
Out of all the words I've told you,

276
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:58,460
forget the ones that tired you.

277
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,680
I'm sorry, Mom,

278
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,900
but I don't think I'll forget.

279
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,280
The words that you told me,

280
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,880
I'll think of it more when I fall into hardship.

281
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,890
But what can I do?

282
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,890
You tried your best.

283
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,320
Okay.

284
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:45,020
I need to change my clothes.

285
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:53,720
Thank you to Korean to English Editors:
mjkrech, mirna023_316, lonequinn
Chief editor: kakashiandme

286
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,950
I won't marry a man whose household opposes it.

287
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,550
Can you live without me?

288
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,250
I can live without you.

289
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,330
Ji Yi.

290
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:08,110
I won't love again.

291
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:10,700
I'm going to grow old by myself and die.

292
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,470
I don't want to break up again.

293
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:17,760
I can't meet again and break up again.

294
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,100
We are not going to break up again.

295
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:23,500
How do I know your heart won't change? Money doesn't change.

296
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,530
You came home early.

297
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:41,450
I have something to discuss with you.

298
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:42,450
Discuss what?

299
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:43,550
Come to my room.

300
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:46,190
No. Why do you tell me to come and go?

301
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:48,590
I assure you,

302
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:52,500
you will come... because you are curious.

303
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,120
Say it. What is it?

304
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,300
You have three sons.

305
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,300
Enough! Don't tell me that.

306
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,280
I did wrong, I did wrong.

307
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,680
I chose you, Mom.

308
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,960
Don't say that, too! I'm getting goosebumps.

309
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,680
I have to marry Ji Yi.

310
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,720
What? Are you crazy?

311
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,270
That can never happen.

312
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:32,090
Just play. I told you I gave permission for you both to play.

313
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,960
Why should I get permission from you to play? I can just play.

314
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,440
Exactly, so just play.

315
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,580
It's complicated if you marry. It's 99% divorce.

316
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:45,200
Meet Ji Yi as much as you want. Then that's good enough.

317
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,560
Even if we divorce, I want to marry her.

318
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:54,690
I want to become a man with responsibility. Responsibility, I want it.

319
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:58,810
It makes me feel great, and I think I'll work really well.

320
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:01,380
The reason why I want to marry Ji Yi is genuinely for me.

321
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,620
Then leave. Marry by yourself.

322
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:07,440
I can't do that. Ji Yi said she won't marry a man whose household opposes their marriage.

323
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,290
Therefore, you and Dad must approve.

324
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:12,070
She's very funny.

325
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:14,860
What does she have that will make the man's household not oppose?

326
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,860
Her household isn't a household to show off.

327
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,100
She tends to be funny.

328
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,650
That's how I got to like her.

329
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:24,440
But she...

330
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,960
No matter what she does, she's too much. Even if she has nothing, she has too much of nothing.

331
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,360
Of all things, she doesn't even have a college diploma. She has to have at least something to take her in.

332
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,650
You can make it for her. If you put your heart into it, what is there that you can't do?

333
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:42,230
I'm telling you to put your heart into it. Her heart is good.

334
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,320
She does have a good heart.

335
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,500
But that's good.

336
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,080
Brothers all got married by class.

337
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,240
You need at least one daughter-in-law like this so you can do things.

338
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,100
You said you don't like both sister-in-law's hearts.

339
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,630
Then how are you going to persuade Dad?

340
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,680
Why are you asking me that? You need to do it.

341
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,580
Me?

342
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:08,340
Of course, then who will do it? Do you think Dad will leave me alone if I do it?

343
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,280
At least, you know.

344
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,120
I know. I choose Mom.
- AH!!

345
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,730
You scared me!

346
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:20,610
I chose you, Mom. Not girls.

347
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:22,900
You are really a trickster...

348
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:26,810
I am a trickster. Whose son am I?

349
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:29,130
I don't want to be separated from you,

350
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:32,960
and I don't want to be separated from Ji Yi either. I want both.

351
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,520
Chang Soo, you just need to pass this season in your life.

352
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,020
Let's pass this season together.

353
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,450
Let's leave for Paris for three years and come back

354
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:45,620
No. I want to live with her.

355
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:51,040
Even if we separate after living together for a day, I still want to do it. Even if we separate after living together for ten days, I still want to do it.

356
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,830
Hurry and use your head.

357
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,290
Use what head?

358
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:01,250
Persuading father, persuading Ji Yi and polishing up Ji Yi.

359
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,240
Hey!

360
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,120
I want to live happily with you forever.

361
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,100
Even if I separate with Ji Yi after living with her, you're still here.

362
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,240
I want to be a man.

363
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,860
It's hot.

364
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,330
That scared me!

365
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:43,510
Who is it?

366
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,900
I was about to call you, so I came.

367
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,700
Why?

368
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,720
Mom will call you soon.

369
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,650
Why?

370
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,100
She'll ask to meet with you.

371
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,320
Exactly, so why?

372
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,850
Let's talk after meeting with Mom.

373
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,660
I came today because you might be shocked from my mom's phone call.

374
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:21,600
My mom, you.

375
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,650
I decided to intervene between you two.

376
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,480
I'm leaving.

377
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,110
I met Oppa.

378
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,740
What did he say?

379
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:05,340
He chose me as the last person who would remember his existence.

380
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:09,310
See there, that's the same thing I told you.

381
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:13,910
No, you said Oppa used me as a witness.

382
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:16,170
Your head must be bad.

383
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:19,210
What's the difference between someone who'll remember and a witness?

384
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:21,810
He just changed the words to sound better but they're the same.

385
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:23,730
He's usually good at covering things that way.

386
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:26,580
I want to choose the path of trusting people.

387
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,700
It all depends on which perspective you look at.

388
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,580
Now, you accepting Choi Joon Gi's resignation letter

389
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:37,330
and my numbers; tell me how they relate.

390
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:45,270
I told him to absorb the China expansion team.

391
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,620
You fired him for not doing that?

392
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,140
He quit personally on his own.

393
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:54,260
If he did that well, he would have been a shoo-in.

394
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:58,320
But someone of that level... He went home.

395
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,180
Why did you come to our company?

396
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,980
Moreover, under Ye Won.

397
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:32,070
I can't reply to your question right now.

398
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,390
Why?

399
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:35,850
I just can't tell you right now.

400
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,210
You said that you would make sure that I won't step foot into this industry.

401
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:44,130
Would you be able to do it? Become strong, Jang Yoon Ha.

402
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,010
I can't do this for free.

403
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:53,080
Although I want to say I don't need it, I need it, so give it to me.

404
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,410
I'll help you.

405
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:58,970
It'll become hard to be involved with me.

406
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:01,150
Ye Won unnie won't like it right away.

407
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:06,610
When the hunt is over, I have the choice to not bring the prey to the hunter.

408
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:08,750
Win.

409
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,710
I will win.

410
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,930
I know now.

411
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:19,470
Why it felt like I didn't say sorry, even though I said I was.

412
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,090
It's because I didn't get punished for what I did wrong.

413
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:31,420
♫ Every day by day without you ♫

414
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:35,200
♫ All day long ♫

415
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:41,810
♫ I feel like I'm going to die from the pain in my heart  ♫

416
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:04,690
Are you doing well?

417
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:06,770
I heard you quit.

418
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:08,110
How did you know?

419
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:11,510
Yoon Ha called me and asked why you quit.

420
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:16,600
But I'm also curious. Why did you quit?

421
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,810
Chang Soo,

422
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:21,130
you know...

423
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:24,210
I didn't want to live like my parents.

424
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,610
Especially my father.

425
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:29,390
I also don't want to live like my parents.

426
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:33,190
But you know now,

427
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:37,090
I came to think that it's fine to live like my parents.

428
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:41,090
I lived my life just looking forward.

429
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:45,210
I thought I was old, but I'm only in my 20's.

430
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:48,830
Because I'm still in my 20's, I'm going to catch my breath before going further.

431
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:51,030
Sure...

432
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:55,810
We're only in our 20's. I thought we got so old.

433
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:59,390
You are still progressing with Lee Ji Yi, right?

434
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:02,270
How did you know?

435
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:05,550
Have we met 1 or 2 girls?

436
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:10,530
We know that there won't be other girls who'll make us feel so deeply.

437
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:14,240
That's why.

438
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,050
Even when I met Ji Yi for the the first time, I didn't know I would become this genuine.

439
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:20,430
Will you be able to choose Lee Ji Yi?

440
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,550
I already chose.

441
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:29,090
But Ji Yi rejected me. She said she likes money more than me.

442
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:32,450
She said she's going to gather money while living alone.

443
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:36,600
Isn't that telling you to hold on to her?
- Right?

444
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:40,610
Now it's time to win someone over like you said.

445
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,830
I don't know if it'll work out.

446
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:47,000
The kind of mess I've seen you do...

447
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,140
I think you can do it, you punk.

448
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:54,120
Will you come again to me, punk?

449
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,070
I don't want to right now.

450
00:32:56,070 --> 00:33:01,160
But I'm slowly growing to like you, more than before.

451
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,110
Crazy bastard.

452
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:13,690
I lived well here.

453
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:18,400
Things turned out well with you tidying stuff here.

454
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:23,160
Ahjumma, I'm very hurt, are you rubbing salt?

455
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:27,450
Why would I rub salt at something good?
- Is this something good?

456
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:32,150
Think that starting fresh is a good thing.

457
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:36,170
It's good to start with new people in a new way.

458
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:39,430
I'm being kicked out, with a lot of money.

459
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:41,650
What does that mean?

460
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:44,120
Ahjumma,

461
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,310
although it's hard abruptly ending a marriage,

462
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:49,870
it's the same for a man and a woman.

463
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:54,440
Then, you're not tidying and starting a fresh life?

464
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,910
I'm cleaning up the house, but-

465
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:02,500
This thing called feelings, do you think it's easy to clean it up?

466
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,440
So it is like that...

467
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,910
So, I'm telling you, when my house becomes set, I'll call you.

468
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:11,010
Do I have to go, too?
- Yes.

469
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:13,790
I just hate when I bring in people that I don't know.

470
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:18,260
I know everything I have to know about you, so there's no need to guard myself.

471
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:21,240
But what to do...

472
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:24,300
I already planned to go to another house.

473
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:29,420
You can't! How much is there? I will give you more, don't go there!

474
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:32,900
I can't, I've already promised.

475
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:38,980
They'd been asking for a long time but I wasn't able to go (because of you).

476
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:42,510
Ahjumma, I'll give you some advice.

477
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:46,520
What remains from doing this work? In the end,

478
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:51,040
it's money. It's right to follow where there is a lot of money.

479
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:55,130
I am sorry.

480
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:57,870
It can't be done.

481
00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:00,830
Is everything from this house gone now?

482
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:04,590
When you already know that everything is gone...

483
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:08,210
Ahjumma, you're not very good at changing topics!

484
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:10,560
Let's go now.

485
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,890
Okay, let's go out.

486
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:16,660
Ahjumma! Will you call me?

487
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,730
Let's go together!

488
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:26,250
We'll take you there.

489
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:40,020
You heard from father, right? I'm here for the meeting between Taejin Home Shopping and Albimama.

490
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,550
Incredible!

491
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,630
Did I lose to you?

492
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:47,790
You've never won against me.

493
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:51,840
You won't be able to step inside Taejin anymore. You can't become a board member.

494
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,290
I'm going to report it to Baymium.

495
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:59,130
For now, I'm satisfied with being on the Albimama board of directors.

496
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:01,250
Don't forget that my shares are 12%.

497
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,970
Whatever you do, things won't go your way.

498
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:06,230
Who will follow you?

499
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:10,360
Even if you say everything is fine now, it's still in people's heads.

500
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,290
The fact that you were ill.

501
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:15,790
That's why you'll continue to lose to me.

502
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:18,690
Because you can't step outside that common awareness.

503
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:22,450
If I win, the fact that I was ill becomes a myth.

504
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:27,600
Quit being so arrogant... when you've become captured after running away.

505
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:32,250
You've lost ever since you were born. Why can't you acknowledge that?

506
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:36,690
No matter how well you do, you can't win against me. Because,

507
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:40,690
I win from being born this way.

508
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,700
Here, let's see.

509
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:03,050
Is it ready?
- Yes it is.

510
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:06,310
It must be so good!

511
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:08,090
Oh my...

512
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:10,430
What's going on, you didn't call.

513
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:12,310
Who calls that they're coming home?

514
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:15,860
Sit! Sit!
- Joon Gi is here.

515
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:19,390
Our Joon Gi as expected, you're blessed with things to eat.

516
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:21,550
Try and eat it. Dad made it.

517
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:25,190
What would you like for lunch?
- I just sat down.

518
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:28,350
Rejuvenate his body; what about ginseng chicken soup?

519
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:31,490
The chicken broth is good! I will go to the market and make it.

520
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:34,150
Don't do that, let's go out and eat. Don't tire yourself.

521
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:38,250
It's not hard. If we eat out, how much will it be?

522
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:48,310
Look at the way your mother acts. During the daytime, she's like a swallow.

523
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:53,400
Here, eat it.

524
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:01,250
You only stay home?

525
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:04,440
Yes, almost.

526
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,230
There are times when I feel stuffy.

527
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:15,150
Is there a place you want to go to?

528
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:20,050
I... well I like staying with you.

529
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:22,430
There's nothing in particular I want to do.

530
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:29,190
It'd be nice to go out and get some air before your mom comes.

531
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:43,890
It's okay, I will do that.

532
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:47,310
No, I will do it.

533
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,810
I like it so much.

534
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:03,600
I heard you quit your job.

535
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,110
Yes.
- Don't worry.

536
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:10,090
Everybody can live.

537
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:13,680
Yes.
- I raised you.

538
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,050
I liked it a lot.

539
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:21,230
I like the fact that you are my son.

540
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,470
Dad...

541
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:36,510
When we went to the playground,

542
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:41,230
do you remember? We went and rode the duck boat.

543
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:16,520
Yes, Mother.

544
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,060
Hi, Angela! Listen...

545
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:22,610
We will be at my summer house in Hawaii next week.

546
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:25,410
Why don't you come and see us?

547
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:28,150
It would be great if you do that!

548
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:32,160
Well, when everything is fixed, I'll be in touch with you soon.

549
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,180
Alright! I miss you, too. Bye-bye.

550
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:44,820
Mother, you're so cool.

551
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,340
For what?
- You can speak English.

552
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,390
You're way better than me.

553
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:52,070
Being worse than me isn't something to brag about.

554
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:55,960
I'm not bragging but it's the truth. I'm jealous.

555
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:59,190
If you're jealous, then you can learn, too.

556
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,930
Would you teach me?

557
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:06,770
Look at her trying to stick to me.

558
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:09,890
Did you feel it?
- I felt it.

559
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:14,630
I'll just be frank.
- Speak freely.

560
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,100
I won't oppose the marriage.

561
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:25,080
So, there is no such thing where a man's household opposes the marriage.

562
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,580
It ends when you both date and then break up.

563
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,910
You are going to meet Chang Soo, right?

564
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:38,350
No.
- What?

565
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:42,760
You're a really funny girl. Who are you to keep saying that you won't meet him?

566
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:47,140
You being like that, you're trying make Chang Soo yearn for you, right?

567
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:50,680
No. The Director and I,

568
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,540
even if we say we like each other and get married now,

569
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:57,380
we will probably end up getting divorced anyway.

570
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:01,090
This girl, really...

571
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,890
Me, what... we, what. Do you think that I let you both meet without knowing that?

572
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:09,420
Of course, it would be like that! I know, so why wouldn't you know?

573
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:11,780
"While thinking about this and that,

574
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:16,270
even so, as of now, this is the best choice," is what I'm trying to tell you.

575
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:19,750
You, our Chang Soo

576
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:23,460
is a handsome man with a big responsibility.

577
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:26,840
I know that, too.
- What do you know?!

578
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:30,630
If you know, why are you saying you won't date him and talking about divorce?

579
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:34,560
If an adult gave permission, you're supposed to say, "Thank you."

580
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:36,650
Thank you.

581
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,000
What?
- If you meant to secure me like that,

582
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:43,570
I like it. I'll meet with the Director.

583
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:48,850
Okay.
- Then, may I go in?

584
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:51,430
I used my lunch break to briefly step out.

585
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:53,430
Yes, okay.

586
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,840
But something is a bit weird.

587
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:01,420
What?
- No, well,

588
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,630
instead of giving you permission,

589
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:06,360
I get the feeling that I lost.

590
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,210
There's no way that would happen, Mother!

591
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:11,240
Right? There's no way, right?

592
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,970
There's no way I would lose.

593
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:15,950
Of course, Mother. You won.

594
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:19,850
I was defeated by you, so I'm going to meet again with the Director.

595
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:38,670
[Ji Yi]

596
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:44,860
Did you meet Mom?
- I met her.

597
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:48,940
I would like it if I was right about what you guys talked about.

598
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:51,000
I think you're right.

599
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:55,890
You should talk to me now.
- Say it.

600
00:43:55,890 --> 00:44:00,820
Let's meet after I'm done with company work. I'm busy right now. I also need to eat and live.

601
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:03,990
Plus, I'm not a full-time employee.

602
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:07,570
It must be difficult having to sign on year-after-year.

603
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:12,200
You know something now that you've worked at a company, huh?

604
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,800
You told me not to call you, so I came. But you weren't here, so I waited.

605
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:43,520
Let's go in.
- No.

606
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:46,760
There are a lot of bad memories in your house.

607
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,490
I felt like a fool here.

608
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:52,590
I was love struck.
- Let's get one thing straight.

609
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:56,770
When I was with you here, the fool was me, not you.

610
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:58,980
Here you go again.

611
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:03,850
I have to leave this up there. I bought dumplings for me to eat later.

612
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:06,470
Leave it. I'll be outside waiting.

613
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:08,300
What are we going to do?

614
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,760
It's dinner time, so we should eat.

615
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:15,470
I became unemployed; I need to save money.

616
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:20,580
I'll buy, okay?
- Okay.

617
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:39,560
Why did you act like you were all that? Did you think someone was going to be thankful?

618
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:43,700
Because of your thoughtfulness, I got docked in the performance review.

619
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,270
Sorry.

620
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:49,790
Well, you don't necessarily have to be sorry.

621
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:53,600
It's a technique. Making you come and find me.

622
00:45:56,050 --> 00:46:00,320
Thank you. Because of you, I've made a lot of contracts in Shanghai and China.

623
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:04,750
I'm happy because sales have increased.
- It's because you're doing well, I just connected you.

624
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:08,270
But since you came to work under my sister...

625
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:11,770
was the absorption of the China team planned?

626
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:16,370
She didn't tell me back then. After joining the company, she told me after a few days.

627
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:18,810
Then what do those words mean?
- What words?

628
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:22,320
I asked you before. Why you moved to our company.

629
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:26,470
You said this back then, that you couldn't reply at that moment.

630
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:31,650
You remembered that?
- Of course, I was so curious.

631
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:41,540
Don't look at me like that. It's like you're trying to make a move so it makes me extra alert.

632
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:47,840
Because of you.
- Why because of me?

633
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:51,820
Because I missed you.

634
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,330
You wanted to see me even if it was like that?

635
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:59,120
Let's stop.
- Why should we stop?

636
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:01,300
Let's be accurate and then move on.

637
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:04,870
So, the reason why you moved to the company was because you missed me, right?

638
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:08,000
Let's stop it, please.
- Why?

639
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:11,450
Are you shy? Embarrassed?

640
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:14,620
Oh, you were like this?
- Like what?

641
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:18,400
Like that.

642
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,960
Why?

643
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:39,390
My mom told me

644
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:43,880
there are circumstances where you start with numbers and it becomes love

645
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:47,890
and where you start with love and it becomes numbers.

646
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:53,100
I thought being innocent was being clean without blemishes.

647
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:58,560
I wanted perfection from those who tried to be close to me.

648
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:04,130
Don't do that Yoon Ha.
- What?

649
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:06,750
You're settling.

650
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:09,760
You're trying to understand my actions towards you.

651
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:14,150
Of course, I know that just because you love someone

652
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:17,050
things don't work out 100%.

653
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:21,050
In love, you need a lot of different feelings

654
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:23,580
to know that the love is deep.

655
00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:29,110
Don't try to understand me, and just throw me away.

656
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:34,160
When did I say I was going to have you? You're going overboard.

657
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:36,130
Then that's fine.

658
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:38,820
Don't worry.

659
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:43,850
But when did you start to love me?

660
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:47,590
I was curious about that.
- From when?

661
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:50,960
Yeah, since when? You said you loved me.

662
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,940
So, when did it start?

663
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:57,580
When we had our first kiss?

664
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:03,760
No.
- My feelings are hurt.

665
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:09,520
Even when I want to think about it positively, my blood runs backwards knowing you kissed me even though you didn't even like me.

666
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:15,390
I'm sorry.
- You should be sorry. Then, from when?

667
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:18,270
Why are you curious about that?
- You should be curious about

668
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:23,650
the next time I date someone I can know when that guy would start to have interest in me.

669
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:27,880
Love isn't a calculation. Each man is different

670
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:31,530
so don't worry and just do whatever you want.

671
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:33,600
You're so focused on this.

672
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:38,360
Really, it's a lie that you told me you loved me.

673
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:41,810
How could you not know when it was?
- What are you going to do when you know?

674
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:45,330
I'm not going to do something when I know, but I want to know. Can't I?

675
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:47,090
Okay.

676
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:51,490
Then, tell me.

677
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,930
The first moment when I loved you was when...

678
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:58,250
The moment?

679
00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:04,940
I can't say here.
- Why?

680
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:08,950
I want to confirm that moment as well... If it was that place.

681
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:13,400
If it's a location, do you want to go together?

682
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,440
No.

683
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:21,480
If we go to that place,

684
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:24,620
I won't let you go.

685
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,260
I'm late again.

686
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:44,230
It must be nice being an executive. You can leave whenever you want.

687
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:46,370
Like always the view here is nice.

688
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:50,080
I'm just barely making it with the view. It can't disappear.

689
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:54,420
We had our second kiss here.

690
00:50:57,150 --> 00:51:01,080
Normally, you remember your first kiss.

691
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:06,920
I'm not normal.

692
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:09,630
You're not normal.

693
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,910
Ji Yi,

694
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:18,520
let's live today.

695
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,930
No one knows tomorrow.

696
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:25,050
Let's live today.

697
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:29,500
People will look at us and say "those two will break up,"

698
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:33,860
but still let's live together.

699
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:37,390
I want to live with you.

700
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:42,290
What do you want to do?

701
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:45,320
Will you live with me?

702
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:50,220
Yes.

This place...
- The hotel where you and Chang Soo had your blind date.

720
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,690
That's right.

721
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:55,780
I first saw you here.

722
00:52:55,780 --> 00:53:01,160
With your dark makeup, ripped up jeans and you were chewing gum.

723
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,990
You remember that?

724
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:12,220
It was only a moment but you were in the corner and it was like you were in your own world.

725
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:21,260
Come to think of it now.

726
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,190
It was from the moment I first saw you.

727
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:31,540
Jang Yoon Ha,

728
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,940
I love you.

729
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,770
I don't believe in fate.

730
00:53:57,330 --> 00:53:59,440
I will choose.

731
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:02,040
It's you, Choi Joon Gi.

732
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:20,720
♫ And it's like I lose myself in dreaming ♫

733
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:27,960
Innocence is made complete through refinement.

734
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,330
Our start was impure...

735
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:32,880
but through loving each other,

736
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,520
we were able to have a pure love.

737
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:42,480
As we loved, we weren't able to resolve problems, but love gives us the strength to resolve them.

738
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,910
Using the strength to overcome them,

739
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:48,240
we can be truly happy.

740
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:02,080
[ One year later ]

741
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:04,460
I cleared your schedule for today and tomorrow.

742
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:07,670
You're leaving for Shanghai from Incheon Airport.

743
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:10,530
Okay. Today and tomorrow if it's not urgent then don't contact me.

744
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:12,360
Yes.

745
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:28,030
Yes, Ji Yi.

746
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:30,740
I'm going to depart now. With my husband.

747
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:33,930
Okay. I'm going to depart soon with my partner, too.

748
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:36,060
Oh, wait.

749
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:40,110
He's here. I'm going to set off now.

750
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:47,010
I said I'm going to cook this, go over there and rest.

751
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:50,580
This, this! I cook this better.

752
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:54,520
It's burnt! There's a high chance of cancer if you eat burned food.

753
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,540
Rather than not eating burned things...

754
00:55:56,540 --> 00:56:00,510
it's better to just maintain health.
- The Deputy Manager doesn't like burned things.

755
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:03,050
Deputy Manager?

756
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:05,430
Being all together brought back memories from the past that's why.

757
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:08,530
Long ago? It was just a little over a year ago... Is it a long time ago?

758
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:10,910
It was long ago.

759
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:14,350
Ah, it was long ago. All my good days are gone.

760
00:56:14,350 --> 00:56:20,840
Oh my, Honey, let's be careful. The child is listening. Do you know how much effort I'm putting into prenatal education?

761
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:24,490
I know.
- And don't pretend to hate it when you obviously like it.

762
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:27,960
When did I do that?
- You like that we're married! Why? Do you not like it?

763
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:30,450
Yeah, it's nice. It's nice.

764
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:34,720
But aren't you two going to get married?

765
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:38,120
Ji Yi, by looking at you I don't think there's anything good about getting married.

766
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:40,400
No! I like it.

767
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:44,080
Of course, it's hard. I'm remaking my status right now.

768
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:48,410
Mother is working hard to give me specs that are fitting of the household.

769
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:51,920
It's not a secret that the expectations are a little difficult to live up to.

770
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,230
I hope you'd know that.

771
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:59,130
But overall, it's fun. More than anything, I like living with Chang Soo.

772
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,150
You like living with me?
- I like it.

773
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:03,940
As I continue to live with you, I like it.

774
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:06,080
I like it, too!

775
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,270
See? We both like it.

776
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:13,060
But...apparently the man is meant to propose first for a higher chance of success.

777
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:16,880
That's right. Apparently the woman needs to ask for a divorce first for a higher chance of success.

778
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:20,210
Don't you feel like they get along for the weirdest reasons?

779
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:26,840
I...don't think I'll be able to get married for the rest of my life.

780
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:30,990
The man I love isn't proposing to me.

781
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,970
Wow!

782
00:57:56,530 --> 00:57:58,550
Will you marry me?

783
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:04,620
When you propose, don't you need to say I love you?

784
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:06,440
That's right.

785
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:11,000
I love you.

786
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,110

789
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:31,490
♫ I want to drink coffee with you. I want to watch movies with you. ♫

790
00:58:31,490 --> 00:58:36,160
What is this? I got married without hearing "I love you." Say it now.

791
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,150
Hey, I said it back then.

792
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:40,420
You were drunk and just went in.

793
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:42,420
No, you didn't! Say it now!

794
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:45,220
Ah, please!
♫ I wanna look at the same places
 ♫

795
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:47,330
♫ I wanna walk with you  ♫

796
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:48,560
It's pretty.

797
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:51,680
♫ every single day ♫

798
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:59,740
We sincerely thank those who have loved High Society until now.
