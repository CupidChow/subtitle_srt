1
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:37,160
The people I love always leave my side.

2
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,370
Your were supposed to die. Die! Die! Die!

3
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:48,590
I can't ever love someone.

4
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,450
I missed you.

5
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,430
I wanted to run to you.

6
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,200
But I couldn't do that.

7
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,240
What if you get hurt because of me?

8
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,740
The beginning of a relationship is easier psychologically if you conform to custom.

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,260
Will you date me?

10
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,800
I'm not actually poor...

11
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,620
The part-time job...I started it so I could endure my family.

12
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:27,740
If I didn't like my family, I could have just left. But I was scared.

13
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,320
Being alone without any money.

14
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,670
Don't throw me away.

15
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,120
Please don't throw me away.

16
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:43,400
♫ Please stop coming close to me ♫

17
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:51,060
♫ Because your warmth will surely shake me up ♫

18
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:58,820
♫ As much as I am holding back from you ♫

19
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:08,420
♫ It may hurt but I have to hold back from you ♫

20
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,430
Now there's nothing I'm deceiving you about.

21
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,520
Because I felt like I was starting love with a lie,

22
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,860
it was uncomfortable.

23
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,720
Now what are you going to do?

24
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:36,700
I want to eat ramyun, where you boil it in a nickel-silver pot.

25
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,960
Come here.

26
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:54,020
I like people who are faithful. I like people who keep in contact in any circumstance.

27
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:58,340
From now on, there won't be any such incidences.

28
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,490
High Society
Episode 5

29
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,140
After you are done at the workplace, see me in the parking lot.

30
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,980
I'm going to your house for the first time. Should I buy something?

31
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,440
You want to hear something cheesy like I only need you?

32
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,600
No.

33
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,590
Go.

34
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,480
Okay.

35
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,920
Hey! Deputy Choi!

36
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,580
You're not dating the part-time worker by any chance?

37
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:45,720
Deputy Sung, I've heard that you're on the Executive Director's side lately.

38
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,800
Did you think that you would be the only one on the golden ladder?

39
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,310
You're here, Director.

40
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,370
Don't bother with me and get back to your work.

41
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,110
Nice to meet you, Director.

42
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,730
I'm Deputy Sung Tae Sik, Deputy Choi Joon Ki's colleague.

43
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,070
Acting so tacky...

44
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,430
Didn't we greet each other last time?

45
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,430
Do you remember?

46
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,430
Are you doing it twice in case I don't remember?

47
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,750
If you act like this, I can't patrol this area properly.

48
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,710
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,400
Aren't you selling it?

50
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,540
We are.

51
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,660
Have you heard of the chicory ssam?
(Ssam: Korean wrap food where you wrap rice, meat and other condiments into a leafy vegetable)

52
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:43,360
If you make a ssam out of chicory, it tastes pungent. And it gives a piquant taste.

53
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,460
Give me one. What are you going to do if it doesn't have a piquant taste?

54
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,740
It does! I've eaten it before.

55
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,380
Your taste and mine could be different.

56
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,440
Then bring it back. I'll give you a refund.

57
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,200
How can I bring it back if I ate it?

58
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,670
Can I just give you me instead?

59
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,910
What? Is it so corny you can't say anything?

60
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:08,950
Showing interest in the beginning but then cutting ties in the middle is so typical.

61
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:13,270
So... You missed me right?

62
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,250
Yes.

63
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,800
You like this kind of thing? Being honest in this kind of situation.

64
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,230
Here you go.

65
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:28,030
Bring it to me later. How can I go around with this?

66
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,390
Where should I bring it?

67
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:48,830
Han Nam Dong sent it to you. I think it's Gong Jin Dan.
(A Korean oriental globule medicine. Usually used as
heart-stimulant for blood-nourishment.)

68
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,770
She can't tell the difference between what's high class and what's low class.

69
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:54,110
Should I throw it away?

70
00:05:55,010 --> 00:06:01,080
From now... I'll only treat humans as humans.

71
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:11,820
I don't know why but I have so much I want to eat.

72
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,900
You made the leek kimchi so well!

73
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,260
It tastes like the ones my mother use to make me when I was young.

74
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,100
What about rice?

75
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,400
Potato pancake and rice are about the same thing. They're both carbs.

76
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,780
I'm not going to eat dinner.

77
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,720
I'm going to go to the fitness center and take a look around the department store and then come home.

78
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,190
It must be the delivery man.

79
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:36,090
The department store said they would send the clothes that I couldn't buy because they weren't in my size.

80
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,910
Who is it?

81
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,070
It's Sung Bok Dong.

82
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:44,420
It's some man. He said he's from Sung Bok Dong.

83
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,500
Sung Bok Dong?

84
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,720
What is he doing here?

85
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,240
Ahjumma, open the door.

86
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,600
She said to sit there and wait.

87
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,400
Excuse me, it's over here...

88
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,410
Please clear this.

89
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:21,270
Hyungnim, what brings you here?

90
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,970
Oh my!

91
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:30,800
It's too dirty here so I can't speak to you here.

92
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:43,640
Ahjumma, please stay outside. Come back in after 30 minutes.

93
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,610
No, make that one hour.

94
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,900
It looks like you vent with other people's help.

95
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:02,000
As expected...royal to the bone is different.

96
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,950
Please take a seat.

97
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:10,590
I sent you that to comfort you but were you displeased with it?

98
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,710
After Gyeong Joon died, I was–

99
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:29,050
Hyungnim, since your condition isn't good, I will get hit just this once.

100
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,950
Please take a seat.

101
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,830
Oh my! Oh my, Hyungnim!

102
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,730
Excuse me...

103
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,180
Why are you doing this!?

104
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,760
Why is my Gyeong Joon's name coming from your mouth?

105
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,820
Did I kill Gyeong Joon? Why are you doing this to me?

106
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,680
Gyeong Joon is not dead.

107
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,380
Go to the psychiatric ward!

108
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,360
Seeing you suddenly act weird like this–

109
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,780
Shall I burn your face with an iron?

110
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,880
Scared? You said it yourself.

111
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,920
You said if it were you, you'd burn their faces with an iron.

112
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:14,240
When I treated you like a human, you should have acted like one.

113
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,820
In the past, there were many things that I had to protect,

114
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,410
but now there isn't even a single thing.

115
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:24,640
I still have energy to do something about someone like you!

116
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,280
How dare you look at me straight in the eye.

117
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,820
You vulgar and shallow thing!

118
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:37,760
I will come back. Next time, I'll come back with an iron.

119
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,080
Not with a traditional Korean iron, but with a modern iron.

120
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,140
I'm going to come every day. The same amount of time that you have spent with my husband.

121
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,720
I will wait for my son.

122
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,440
Pray that my son Gyeong Joon comes back alive.

123
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:29,360
So this is why people use violence. It's great.

124
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:15,970
A chaebol's wife is nothing much, after all.

125
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:18,930
She is the same type of human as me.

126
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:27,490
I thought she was incredible for staying so refined even as I purposely irritated her right on her nerves.

127
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:32,630
As expected, educated women sure are different.

128
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:39,160
Distinguished families sure are different.
Concubines and wives sure are different.

129
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:44,700
I thought that not anyone becomes the wife of a chaebol, but...

130
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,240
it's all the same. It's the same.

131
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:59,760
Now, we both saw each other naked so let's fight.

132
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,860
All your life, you've been clothed. Try to live naked now.

133
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,260
Do they think living naked is that easy?

134
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,520
I came all the way here with my body.

135
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,720
I won't just sit still and suffer.

136
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,480
Sit down.

137
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,300
No... Here.

138
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,760
It must be true that you like me, too.

139
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,780
There's a separate team for deliveries. You didn't even have to come.

140
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,400
It's because of that stupid street lamp.

141
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,220
Do you know how much it gets on my nerves when I go in and out of the house?

142
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,320
How strong do you have to be to put a street light in front of my house?

143
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,980
This girl is overreacting.

144
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,360
If you make a call to the district office, they put it there for you.

145
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,260
Really?

146
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:05,880
You said you liked our country. Our good country did it for you.

147
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,990
I see.

148
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:13,370
Hey, do you marry everyone you date?

149
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,490
No.

150
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,390
Then why can't you date me?

151
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:21,260
Dating and not getting married and having the rule of no marriage in the beginning of dating is different.

152
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,380
While dating you might realize that you don't even want to marry me.

153
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,320
That's right... That's right.

154
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,200
That is right. I thought carefully but

155
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,720
we have no reason to not date.

156
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,920
That is right... There is no reason to not date.

157
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,830
I told you.

158
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,760
But are you going to eat this chicory?

159
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,560
No. You eat it.

160
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,060
Alright. Work hard (goodbye).

161
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,060
You can't just go.

162
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,440
Then what do I need to do...

163
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,700
We decided to date.

164
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:58,520
Let's go eat, my style. I'm a man who wins in the morning and at night.

165
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:03,480
I'm... a woman who loses in the morning and also at night.

166
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,540
It fits perfectly.

167
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,120
I'll see you later..

168
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,000
Yes.

169
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,240
I checked the situation of Taejin Group stock equity at the Stock Exchange Market.

170
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,500
There is nothing special, right?

171
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,620
The... thing is...

172
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:45,580
[Jang Yoon Ha]

173
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,620
Is this Jang Yoon Ha, my younger sister, Jang Yoon Ha?

174
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,440
Yes, I checked.

175
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,440
Why did she buy stocks?

176
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,580
How did she get the money to buy this much?

177
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,680
I think the recently deceased Vice President Jang Gyeong Joon

178
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,000
bought it for Jang Yoon Ha.

179
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,060
I overrated Gyeong Joon.

180
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:09,980
It seemed like he was having a close relationship with Yoon Ha but behind my back they were forming an alliance.

181
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,100
Besides the stock Jang Gyeong Joon bought for her,

182
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,960
Miss Jang Yoon Ha also has some she bought herself.

183
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,400
0.1 percent.

184
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,800
What do you mean 0.1 percent?

185
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,360
So added together is 1.1 percent?

186
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,770
What did they even think of doing with that?

187
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:29,910
There are rumors that the President is tranferring some stocks to Miss Jang Yoon Ha.

188
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:30,830
What?

189
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:35,730
There are also rumors that she will be nominated as Director of the Planning Department in the Chinese office.

190
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:38,660
Rumors, rumors, rumors.
They're all just words that wander from person to person.

191
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,640
She did nothing so far, why is she becoming a director?

192
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,110
Director Jang So Hyun of Planning Department

193
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,980
did not do much to get there either.

194
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,950
Do you know why the previous secretary was fired?

195
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,290
I don't know.

196
00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:00,610
I'm looking for my person. I was looking at you for a long time.

197
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,690
You're also my school hubae. (Hubae: junior colleague)

198
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,990
I'll support you wholeheartedly.

199
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:08,570
In the President's generation,

200
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:11,970
my father had many vassals following him.

201
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:18,430
Those vassals did things beforehand what my dad couldn't bring out of his mouth.

202
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:21,510
If he wanted someone dead they killed that person for him.

203
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:25,530
If he wanted a woman they brought her up to him.

204
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:31,930
You, at least, have to do that, to stay under me as my person.

205
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:37,700
Yes, big sis?

206
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,310
What are you doing right now?

207
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,510
I'm just here.

208
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,050
See me for a moment.

209
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:43,140
I can't.

210
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,440
Why?

211
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,960
I have an appointment.

212
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,700
You said you're not doing anything. When's the appointment?

213
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,380
I will see you later.

214
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,020
Are you hiding something from me?

215
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:55,820
No.

216
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,040
Then why are you avoiding me?

217
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,920
Why would I avoid you?

218
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,080
You're going to come home, right?

219
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,760
I guess so.

220
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,130
I'm going home at the moment so I will see you at home.

221
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:22,550
Do it here.

222
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,990
What should I do with the contract length?

223
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:28,850
Till I die, request on one more place.

224
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:33,550
Make those two compete. It's better to compete

225
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,560
than just making one place do it.

226
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:39,730
When the results come out, will you accept them?

227
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,090
Yes.

228
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,670
Mom, I'm here.

229
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:48,180
Oh, then I'll go...
- Yes.

230
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,040
Have a good talk.

231
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,440
What is it?

232
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,540
I requested an investigation of Gyeong Joon's incident.

233
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,740
What incident?

234
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,860
I can't accept it.

235
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:03,440
Everything doesn't make sense. There's no body found.

236
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:08,460
Mom, that area is famous for a lot of accidents.

237
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,980
Every accident there was marked as death.

238
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:15,230
The ship is severely damaged so how are you going to find him in that wide ocean?

239
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,370
It was his mistake to ride a yacht there.

240
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,980
Go away if you're going to say those kinds of words.

241
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:28,730
I understand you the most. I have a child, too.

242
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:33,930
I know what kind of son Gyeong Joon was to you.

243
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:39,530
Do as you wish. I'll help you on everything.

244
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:42,130
Just rely on me Mother, okay?

245
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:02,960
Does anyone at home know you're a part-time worker?

246
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,960
Only my brother knew.

247
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,840
Then where did you say you were while part-timing?

248
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:13,340
Aesthetic treatment, fitness center, dermatology clinic, cooking class... There are lots of excuses.

249
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:17,910
I guess you can be busy playing around in a variety of ways.

250
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:22,370
I take my car out and park it in the parking lot of the building on the opposite side of the department store.

251
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,690
And then walk to the department store.

252
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,690
So... unique. Your determination to do part-time work.

253
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:31,170
While doing part-time work, it opened my eyes to life.

254
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:37,710
I didn't know why money would be a problem in life before.

255
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,230
Are you curious about anything else?

256
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:45,530
Just ask me, I'll tell you.

257
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,530
Little by little.

258
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,510
There's not much movement from Deputy Choi.

259
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:57,220
He's all fired up because of the increase in sales.

260
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:01,940
Keep an eye on him and report anything that's related to Director Yoo.

261
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,680
Okay.

262
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,490
Should I report on personal matters as well?

263
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,250
Personal matters? Like what?

264
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:15,710
It seems like Deputy Choi and Director Yoo are both dating Food Market part-timers.

265
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:20,060
Ah, those punks. They sure like to prove that they're men.

266
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,050
Should I keep reporting to you?

267
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:26,980
Weirdly enough my brain is driving to the bad side.
I'll tell the HR department.

268
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,860
Thank you!

269
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,900
Who is the part-timer that Chang Soo is meeting?

270
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:38,180
You said we were going to eat but why are we here?

271
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,650
Before we eat, we came to match your style and my style.

272
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,910
What about my style?

273
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,640
It's tacky.

274
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:52,430
I don't want to! Why should I accept clothing from you?

275
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,960
Let's just do it like a typical story.

276
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,920
I'm a man with a lot of money. You're a woman with no money. Us?

277
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,960
We are dating.

278
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:06,700
♫ Tears are about to come when I see you ♫

279
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:11,600
♫ My heart fills to the brim, so I start to run to you ♫

280
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:18,800
♫ Nobody knows my heart but perhaps you will ♫

281
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,100
Go in..
♫ Gentle romance that soaks into the corners of my lips ♫

282
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:26,100
♫ Gentle romance that soaks into the corners of my lips ♫

283
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:31,200
Go in.
♫ Your warm name that stuck onto the corners of my lips ♫

284
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:39,800
♫ Nobody knows why my heart is racing to you ♫
♫ Closer and closer to you ♫

285
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,310
Is it not good? I think it's pretty.
♫ Closer and closer to you ♫

286
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,250
Take this and get one more.

287
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:49,620
You sure have a lot of money! How many are you going to buy me? You do have a lot of money!

288
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,700
I will try other clothes, too.
♫ Gentle romance soaks into the corners of my lips all day long ♫

289
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,700
♫ Gentle romance soaks into the corners of my lips all day long ♫

290
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:00,700
♫ Your warm name that stuck onto the corners of my lips ♫

291
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:05,500
♫ Nobody knows why my heart is racing to you ♫

292
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,300
It seems like you have bought things for women many times.

293
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,700
♫ Closer and closer to you ♫

294
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,400
There weren't many cases where I personally came and bought it.

295
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:16,290
I'll just believe that I am special.

296
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,120
Whatever you like.

297
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:25,060
♫ You smile to my "I love you" ♫

298
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:32,940
♫ Maybe someone is sneaking a glance at our love ♫

299
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:37,610
♫ My heart goes closer to you ♫

300
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:39,860
♫ More of you inside me ♫

301
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,260
Welcome.

302
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,260
I love it so much.

303
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:56,110
Welcome. It has been a long time since you've last come.

304
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,420
I was busy.

305
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,600
I see.

306
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,010
Ah, she's my girlfriend.

307
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,390
She is a beauty.

308
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,610
What did he say? I felt like he said something about me.

309
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:09,580
You have quick senses.

310
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,610
I think he said that I am a beauty.

311
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,150
What the?

312
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,340
Please tell him thanks!

313
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:19,360
She says that you have an excellent eye for things.
She acknowledges that she's a beauty.

314
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,630
Did she? Here.

315
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:26,620
She's more beautiful than the woman last time.

316
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:30,280
You are also amazing.

317
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,620
- Hello. ( Japanese accent in formal Korean)
- Oh, hello! (polite Korean)

318
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,140
- Thank you! ( in Japanese)
-Thank you.

319
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,920
Do you even know what he said?

320
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,950
Out of all the woman you brought, he's saying I'm the prettiest.

321
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,820
Wow!

322
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:52,140
It's so tasty! It melts in my mouth.

323
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,340
This is the house where I live.

324
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:10,690
Wow! It's so clean, not like a home a man lives by himself.

325
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,100
Should I give you comfortable clothes?

326
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,260
Do you have girl clothes, too?

327
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,140
No, my clothes.

328
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,970
It's okay.

329
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,760
Are you sleepy?

330
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:27,700
I didn't get to sleep lately. Even with sleeping pills, I couldn't sleep.

331
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:32,280
After I told you about everything, I think my tensions got loose.

332
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,240
It's not okay, come here.

333
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,190
Get some rest here, I'll prepare dinner.

334
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,890
I don't have to rest.

335
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:48,390
Just close your eyes for a moment.

336
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,170
It's okay.

337
00:24:56,670 --> 00:25:00,170
Really, I'm not sleepy.

338
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:03,420
Alright, let's just say you're not sleepy.

339
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,580
I'm not that sleepy.

340
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:28,760
Ajusshi, what's going to happen to this room?

341
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,020
We have to leave it empty.

342
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,270
I might come in to live here.

343
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,980
What are you saying?

344
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:40,440
"Married couple" is just a title. It's lonely and hard.

345
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,140
I want to be together where father and mother are.

346
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:47,140
If you also get divorced in this situation,

347
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,700
what would become of Agassi's feelings?

348
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:56,660
It's better to get the worst out of the way first.
Wouldn't it be better to get it over with right now?

349
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:01,900
Do I have to change my life's schedule because of Gyeong Joon, who's not even here?

350
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:05,210
Ajusshi, you can stay next to my Mom and take care of her.

351
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:08,570
What is there that I can do?

352
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:11,550
Let my mother accept reality.

353
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,610
Which companies did you request an investigation of Gyeong Joon's case? I'll check with them, too.

354
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:23,870
I'm the first daughter, so it should be my duty to make my parents feel comfortable.

355
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,260
What about dinner?

356
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,090
I will eat here and leave.

357
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:32,370
Tell Chef Kim to put at least one side dish that I like.

358
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,560
I had a great time.

359
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,400
It's not 12 o'clock yet, but I will return back to reality.

360
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,140
You have to take this with you.

361
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,640
I don't want it.

362
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,870
Return them when you go to the department store tomorrow.

363
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:19,480
Since you are the director of the department store, you should know that, right?

364
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,860
I don't know what you are talking about.

365
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:26,990
I tried being Cinderella. I was curious about what that was about.

366
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:30,890
Are you telling me to return it because your curiosity got resolved?

367
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:35,190
It's not that great. I kept making calculations in my head.

368
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:38,340
Wow, it's really expensive. This is worth a 6-month wage.

369
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:42,440
I should just accept it, get a refund later and deposit the money.

370
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:47,750
"Wow, it's $200 for one meal! It is really delicious."

371
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:52,040
"I want to come here again. If I ask him to buy this again, he'll laugh at me, right?"

372
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:56,960
Are these thoughts something I should be thinking in front of a man that I am dating?

373
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:00,340
I really hate myself for acting this way.

374
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,190
Let's break up.

375
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:07,400
It hasn't even been 12 hours since we said that we should date.

376
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,230
Britney Spears got a divorce 3 days after her marriage.

377
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,550
This is nothing compared to that.

378
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:18,020
The clothes that I am wearing right now, I will drop them off at your office.

379
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,310
Hey!

380
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:34,240
Did you just use me to do your Cinderella play?

381
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,220
Being used is the thing I hate the most.

382
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,650
You think that you were being used?

383
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,250
Was I not?

384
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:43,720
I'm going to call the district office to get rid of the street lamp!

385
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:48,140
Why does the street lamp come up right now? You really need to study Korean again!

386
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,780
There is no logic. No logic at all.

387
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:53,890
Please lower your head for a moment.

388
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,730
Why?

389
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:19,070
♫ Kiss me like you want to be loved, want to be loved ♫

390
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:21,890
♫ Want to be loved ♫

391
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:24,710
What was that?

392
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:28,030
I'm starting to like you.

393
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:31,790
I wasn't going to like you

394
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:34,440
but you're too cute.

395
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,680
Meeting you is like a dream.

396
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:44,440
The street lamp... Since you have a lot of money, since you can do everything,

397
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,430
I thought that it was placed there for me.

398
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:53,370
There's nothing free in this world. But love is free.

399
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:01,950
I'm getting to like you more and more.

400
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:05,030
But I'm hating myself more and more.

401
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,180
It can't be like this.

402
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:20,660
You have an ability to bring out a man's sense of responsibility.

403
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,090
♫ So kiss me like you want to be loved ♫

404
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:35,760
♫ You want to be loved, You want to be loved ♫

405
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:42,830
♫ This feels like falling in love ♫

406
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:48,330
♫ I've fallen in love, I've fallen in love ♫

407
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,450
♫ Kiss me like you want to be loved ♫

408
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:05,450
Yes.

409
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:12,200
I'm at home.
- Are you going to sleep soon?
- I'm about to eat dinner.

410
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:15,900
Isn't it too late for dinner? It's past 10 pm.

411
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:19,670
I'm going to hang up, hurry up and eat!

412
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,220
Was it your mother?
-Yeah.

413
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,630
She must have called you because she was worried that you are skipping meals.

414
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:33,610
That's what moms do; worry about their children's meals.

415
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:39,510
I don't think I've heard, "come eat" from my mom often.

416
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:45,720
We can eat ramen next time. It's dinner after all. We should at least eat spaghetti.

417
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:51,510
I slept so well, you should have woken me up.

418
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:54,040
If I woke you up, you looked as if you were going to punish me.

419
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:57,960
I slept so soundly. I might have been angry if you woke me up.

420
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,710
It looks delicious.

421
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:06,970
I will drop you off at home after you eat. We can drink tea in the car.

422
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,550
I don't want to go home.

423
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,520
I can't right..?

424
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:29,060
You can. Call them and sleep here for a day.

425
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,760
You can sleep soundly when you can.

426
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:37,700
Nobody's looking for me at my house.

427
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:47,660
What if... I don't want to go home completely?

428
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,940
Don't go.

429
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:27,330
Can I come in?

430
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,000
It's not that late, I can take you home if you want.

431
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:40,590
Women have things they need if they sleep outside their homes.

432
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:42,770
What do you need?

433
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:48,920
Like clothes you wear underneath...

434
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,000
No, it's fine. I can sleep like this!

435
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,710
Come out, I'll fix that problem for you.
- How?

436
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:03,440
I came here once with Ji Yi before.

437
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:07,430
We said that we'll come again, but I finally came here again. Do you come here frequently?

438
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:10,680
I came here sometimes in college with my girlfriend.

439
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:15,710
Ah, so you had a girlfriend. Were you guys a campus couple?

440
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:21,300
But when a man and a woman date,

441
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:26,670
aren't we not supposed to talk about our past girlfriends or boyfriends? Why are you talking about her?

442
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:32,440
To look like I have something.
- You don't.

443
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,970
How about that one for me?
- Should I try it on?

444
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:49,610
Do you like it?
- I want to buy something that you'd like for me to wear.

445
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:58,010
Hello, I will take a look at this. How's this?

446
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:00,820
♫ Her range was staggering ♫

447
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:06,650
♫ Movement and timing ♫

448
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,680
♫ Frame by frame ♫

449
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:19,730
Excuse me, I think this cup is too small.
- What?

450
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,240
The cup is too small? The B cup should fit.

451
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:24,560
Should I give you a C cup?

452
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,590
You are as amazing as you look!

453
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:29,420
What did you do to make your breasts big like that?

454
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,700
You are so thin, too! How can your breasts be...

455
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:39,240
No, I think it's this brand that makes them small, please give me another brand in B cup!

456
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,940
Please just give it to me, I won't try it on.

457
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:45,050
You have a body that's blessed. How would it feel to live in that kind of body?

458
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:48,770
Did you buy it?
- Are you her boyfriend?
-Yes.

459
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:54,810
You must be lucky! Do you know how blessed you are?

460
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:03,720
What was she saying?
- N-nothing

461
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:06,620
I'm going to buy this.
- I'll buy it for you.

462
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,860
Before you also bought me the one-piece dress.

463
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,940
You are a salaryman. You should conserve money. It took a lot of effort to earn it.

464
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,630
I'm starting to like you. I wasn't going to like you,

465
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:40,010
but you are too cute.

466
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,490
I'm good-looking.

467
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,780
You surprised me!

468
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,920
What are you so surprised about? Were you thinking of something weird?

469
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,100
Can you knock? I have a private life as well.

470
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:13,600
Okay! I won't knock next time!

471
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,400
Don't then. That can't be fixed overnight.

472
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,650
I arranged a blind date with the first daughter of Hwangseon Group. Tomorrow at 3 o'clock.

473
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:25,260
If you are talking about Hwangsan Group's first daughter, isn't it Shi Hyun? She's my hubae from elementary school.

474
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,910
She was happy, saying that she knows you.

475
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:30,380
Oh, but I think she's average; it's the visuals.

476
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:33,400
If she loses weight and fixes her face, her looks will be upgraded.

477
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:37,030
Don't pick fights over that. Let's get married before 30.

478
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:41,300
Let's not set an age restriction. It's so old-fashioned.
- I won't do that, so let's set a restriction for women.

479
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,470
But I don't have to tell you this.

480
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:49,300
You won't do anything like bringing a poor girl here and talk about love.

481
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,700
Wow. Are you trying to put me down?

482
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:56,780
There are so many girls from poor families who are obsessed with catching men from wealthy families.

483
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,490
The second son of Anjin Group was exploited by a gold-digger and was threatened with a video.

484
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:05,220
and was featured in the newspaper.
- Just say the first verse. You are talking too much.

485
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:11,200
I don't worry about you, but things in the world do not occur just because I do the right thing.

486
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,010
The other person has to do the right thing as well.

487
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:18,140
There are poor girls who are strong and have a strong mentality.
- Who is it?

488
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,500
I can't say a specific person. I'm just saying.

489
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,400
We have to have an open view, Mom.

490
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,140
We can't open up to everything. She has to be in the right level.

491
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:32,110
I'm telling you this multiple times. Don't trust Joon Gi too much.

492
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:37,370
Why are you bringing up Joon Gi here?
- While going around with you, he will feel worse about his situation.

493
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:40,330
Even if he doesn't want to, he will feel conscious of his background. He's a person after all.

494
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:43,660
That's a victim mentality? Why do you suspect a person for no reason?

495
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,720
He could have went to a better company than ours.

496
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,290
But he came for me, to help me.

497
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:51,790
That's why you took care of him.

498
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:54,790
You paid for the security deposit of his apartment and got him a car.

499
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:57,380
What I'm saying is to keep a distance!

500
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:00,200
I didn't buy him a house. I just paid for the deposit. Why are you acting like I did something big?

501
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:04,410
That's that. Let's talk about the future.

502
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,850
What future?
- What is Dad going to do?

503
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:10,280
Shouldn't he do a traffic control at this point?

504
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:14,450
I did so well after going into the company. The Food Market was successful as well.

505
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:17,210
Hyung didn't even get to secure the Airport Duty Free Shops.

506
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:20,170
Who said anything?
- Just because I'm the youngest,

507
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:24,190
that doesn't mean that my rank or skill is the lowest.

508
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,840
Why does Hyung have more things than me?
- I know.

509
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:29,220
I am already talking to Dad.

510
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,970
Dad is really weird.

511
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:34,350
He loves me the most, but gives more to Hyung. How is that loving me?

512
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,870
I got it.

513
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,270
Should I set up an another blind date with Yoon Ha?

514
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:41,490
Why is a blind date with Yoon Ha coming up?

515
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,730
Mom, you should learn Korean again.

516
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:47,640
Your randomness is the same as a girl I know.
- Who?

517
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:51,860
You don't need to know.
- You said you don't like Shi Hyun.

518
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:55,000
You should meet her and if you don't like her, we can continue on with Yoon Ha.

519
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:58,220
Forget it. Am I a beast?

520
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,900
Let's have class while doing business.

521
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,640
Alright.

522
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:06,300
Who do you belong to?
- Chang Soo.

523
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,280
Do good.
- Hey!

524
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:13,400
See you, Mom.
- Yeah.

525
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:28,960
You have an ability to bring out a man's sense of responsibility.

526
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:41,800
I'm going crazy...I'm not supposed to be like this.

527
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,240
Am I falling in love again?

528
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,290
I have already fallen!

529
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:51,060
This time, things are not just going to end up in tears but tears for sure.

530
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,530
Are you sleeping?

531
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,050
I'm going to sleep.

532
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,390
You're really going to have to study Korean again.

533
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:12,380
Your spelling is wrong.

534
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:15,340
I am about to sleep.

535
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:20,040
Oh, I like this... these corrections. He seems smart.

536
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,660
What? Is that it?

537
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,860
Are you mad? Why aren't you replying?

538
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:37,110
I'm 100% sure that I will get hurt and the relationship will end.

539
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:40,350
Before I get hurt, I'm going to end it.

540
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:42,980

542
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,560
Why are you doing this to me?

543
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,300
But since he called, I have to answer it.

544
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,910
Hello?

545
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:59,710
Are you sleeping?

546
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:01,890
Don't say it in an affectionate tone.

547
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:04,640
What's wrong?
- Don't say what's wrong.

548
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,620
Seriously, what is wrong with you? Is your personality just this weird?

549
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:11,940
I don't like that. Girls changing their mind all the time.

550
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,300
It's because I like you.

551
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,520
I saw you earlier...

552
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,280
but I want too see you again.

553
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,940
If it's something like that you should say it straight away.

554
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,680
I'm hanging up.

555
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,680
Where are you going?

556
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:34,880
Out front.

557
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,680
But you just took a shower... You never go out even when someone calls you after you take a shower.

558
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,900
Just leave it.

559
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,350
Welcome.

560
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:51,050
What do you want to eat?

561
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:54,370
Grapefruitade and cheese split cake.

562
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:55,350
You're eating cake, too?

563
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:59,460
Yes. After shopping, you are supposed to eat.

564
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,480
I want... Orangeade.

565
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,840
Your eating messy quite well like a baby.

566
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,180
Why didn't you date anyone until now?

567
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,840
Did I say I never dated?

568
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,280
You never said...

569
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,380
But seeing your actions I assumed it.

570
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,050
I have dated before.

571
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:32,930
It's just because it wasn't a long one.

572
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,610
I get doubtful easily.

573
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:40,790
When people know who's daughter I am they start to act differently.

574
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:44,290
Good... or bad.

575
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,470
Do you not like that?

576
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:49,250
I don't like it.

577
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,990
I guess you're still young.

578
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:53,210
What... do you mean?

579
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:57,540
I'm saying your background is you... Your background and you can't stay separate.

580
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:00,780
Background is just a background, not me.

581
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:02,840
You grew up in that background

582
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,720
so it influenced you. Your background is inside you.

583
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:09,680
You can change your background... If my background changes and I change,

584
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,880
that just is not me.

585
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,350
Let's stop talking about our different opinions. What do you want to do now?

586
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:20,030
People that never dated anyone before have a list of things you want to do when you start dating.

587
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:23,280
I have dated someone before!

588
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,920
You're mean.

589
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:31,030
You are now acting cute. You are good at utilizing what you learned, Ms. Never-Dated-Anyone-Before.

590
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:33,510
I told you I'm not.

591
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:40,310
Very simply, let's ride on a bicycle for couples.

592
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:49,330
Are you enjoying this?

593
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:52,170
I am. Were you always good at riding?

594
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:53,840
I have competitions with Chang Soo sometimes.

595
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,400
Who wins?

596
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,900
It changes from time to time.

597
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:00,360
Why do you ride bicycles? Don't motorcycles look cooler?

598
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:04,780
If I borrow what Chang Soo always say, "effort is needed for bicycles." That's why he likes them.

599
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:07,330
You have to keep moving the wheel.

600
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,060
I went on a blind date with Chang Soo once.

601
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:18,030
You're not in a bad mood, right?

602
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:21,910
Well, you were once a campus couple.

603
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:25,160
If you tend to be obsessed with the person you are dating, can you tell me in advance?

604
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:28,400
No, I don't. Can't we go a little faster?

605
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,680
Okay, here we go.

606
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:37,780
♫ Please don’t be hurt from this ♫

607
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:45,490
♫ Because your tears will shake me up again ♫

608
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:53,230
♫ As much as I am pushing you away ♫

609
00:45:53,230 --> 00:46:01,920
♫ It may hurt but I have to hold back from you ♫

610
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:07,780
♫ Tears are spilling out ♫

611
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:17,840
♫ Though I try to push you away and make effort to hold it in ♫

612
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,730
I came.

613
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,340
What's going on?

614
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:37,160
I came since you said you missed me.

615
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,440
I didn't tell you to come though.

616
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,710
But seeing you is great!

617
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,960
Isn't it nice?

618
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,930
The biggest advantage of living in a rooftop house. The view is great.

619
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:54,700
I don't have to agree with you even when it's not really good, right?

620
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,480
Give me your hands.

621
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:04,080
Your hands are really big, even though your face is really small.

622
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,890
Is that so?

623
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:10,640
It is really big, it's covering your entire face.

624
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:14,120
I can't breath, now put your hand away.

625
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,070
I want to do it, too!

626
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,740
You copy all kinds of things I do.

627
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:22,610
Why aren't you letting me do it?

628
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:23,610
You just did!

629
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:26,290
I couldn't do it until I wanted to.

630
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:29,460
Just do it, do it! For the simplest things...

631
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,510
You are so immature.

632
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:35,280
You are so immature.

633
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:41,740
Kissing, can we only kiss once per day?

634
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,490
Are you asking me to kiss you like that?

635
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:47,510
Yes.

636
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:50,100
Didn't you say you didn't like to date me?

637
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:53,640
Yes, it's true, we don't have to if you don't want to.

638
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,440
I will do everything if you ask me. What do you want to do next?

639
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:19,270
What would we have been like if we were born during the Joseon Dynasty?

640
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,760
Young Master...

641
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,250
Why are you so late?

642
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,040
I'm never going to meet you ever again.

643
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:39,060
How can a lowly-being like me meet you?

644
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:41,460
A man and a woman love each other.

645
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,280
What's so lowly about that?

646
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,460
What are you two doing?

647
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:50,570
Mother!

648
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:53,150
Get this wretch outside and break her into pieces!

649
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:55,080
Yes!
- Young Master! Young Master!

650
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,820
Sa Wol!

651
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:59,000
Mother, can it really never work out?

652
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,860
I will kick her out of the country gates after twisting up her legs.

653
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:07,730
Young Master! Young Master! Save me!

654
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:14,240
If that is what you wish, Mother, do it so. However, please get me another woman then.

655
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,920
How can you take a toy away from me so coldly?

656
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:23,940
Wow... Unbelievable.

657
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:28,160
We aren't living in the Joseon Dynasty. I think I got scared too early.

658
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,720
Goodbye.

659
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,730
That rude master is me?

660
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,790
I mean, you really think I'm...

661
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:38,530
Stop.

662
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:43,310
It's not that you are rude. It's obvious to think that way during that time period.

663
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:45,580
Is that right?

664
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:48,620
We are living in a different time period. We have the same status.

665
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:50,940
We have the same status, but there is still a difference.

666
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:53,880
Difference means that we are different. It doesn't mean that you are higher than me.

667
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:56,760
I can't agree with that, yet.

668
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:01,520
I'm a man, and a man decides the rank from the moment he meets someone.

669
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:07,140
I already knew before that a man will not agree with me on everything just because we love each other,

670
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:09,240
but I'm disappointed.

671
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,160
You are just like a young master in the Joseon dynasty.

672
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:17,010
Even if it's not true, can you just agree with me?

673
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:18,900
No.

674
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:31,550
You are a bad guy.

675
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:36,440
All of the cells in my body are telling me to be careful.

676
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,520
But I like you too much.

677
00:50:46,890 --> 00:50:48,410
The view is great.

678
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:50,890
Right? I was right!

679
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:54,850
But your lower body is a bit chubbier than your upper body.

680
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:57,110
How can you wear size 26? You should at least wear 25.

681
00:50:57,110 --> 00:51:00,750
Seriously. Is being tall and handsome all there is to it?

682
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:07,710
Your ears look very weird.

683
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:12,820
Don't. I don't like it when somebody touches my ears.

684
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:15,020
Even if I'm the one who is touching them?

685
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:21,060
Touch them. Touch them.

686
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:23,700
It looks very strange.

687
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:46,180
When did you become friends with Chang Soo?

688
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:48,340
In high school. I went to a foreign language high school.

689
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:51,080
You guys were close since then?

690
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:56,540
We weren't close at first, but there was an incident. We weren't interested in the same things.

691
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:58,380
I just studied.

692
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:03,580
Chang Soo was interested in many things, so he was popular.

693
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:05,940
I was a bit surprised to see that you guys are friends.

694
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:09,640
Most people are friends with people who are similar to them.

695
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:12,120
How did you become friends with Ji Yi?

696
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:15,980
I met her two years ago while working part-time. Her inside and outside are the same.

697
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:19,420
She doesn't like free things. That's why I like her.

698
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:23,520
How can you guys maintain a close relationship when

699
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:27,360
one person knows about the other person but the other doesn't?

700
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:31,940
It's possible. It's Ji Yi.

701
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:35,700
Now, I'm going to tell Ji Yi.

702
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:40,740
She will be surprised, but she will accept me.

703
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,820
Let's talk about us now.

704
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:44,900
About what?

705
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:49,780
Did you lie to me about anything?

706
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:58,520
When I told you that I lied to you, you said that you lied to me as well.

707
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:05,070
You remember that?

708
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:08,210
I have a good brain.

709
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:13,530
That kept bothering me. The one thing I hate the most is a lie.

710
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:23,630
I was trying to console you. "All humans lie, so don't have a hard time."

711
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:28,150
I see.

712
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:31,430
It's my turn now. Are you really going to leave your house?

713
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:34,250
Yes. I planned this since a long time ago.

714
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:35,930
What are you going to do after you come out?

715
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:40,970
I'm stealing what I learned. Since I was young, I learned a lot about cosmetics, even if I didn't want to.

716
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:42,890
I'm going to try it.

717
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:49,030
I don't understand. Why can't you make use of what you have?

718
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:53,370
Then you'll have a head start. Why are you going back and starting with everyone else?

719
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:58,290
I told you already. My background isn't me.

720
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:07,630
Dreams and realities are different. You're saying this because you haven't turned your dream into reality yet.

721
00:54:07,630 --> 00:54:12,730
Have you made it yet? Your dream into reality?

722
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:19,550
Not yet. I'm in the process of making it.

723
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:23,210
What... Even when you're on your high horse, you're just the same as me.

724
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:25,990
You are now talking straightforwardly now that we are close.

725
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:44,370
Mom, that area is known for having a lot of accidents.

726
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:47,750
All the people in accidents that occurred in that area were all declared dead.

727
00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:58,830
Accept it! Even when he dies, he can't clean it up properly.

728
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:04,730
He's too sentimental and weak!! That rascal was a incapable man who could not turn his dream into reality!

729
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:34,630
How can you sleep like this?!

730
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:37,770
Jang Won Shik.

731
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:42,270
You smell like alcohol. How much did you drink?

732
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:44,430
I drank a lot.

733
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:50,050
I'm going to drink more. I'm going drink more, more, and some more.

734
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:53,590
Go to sleep.

735
00:55:55,570 --> 00:55:59,670
Aigoo, aigoo! This, this...! Oh, no! This... It hurts!

736
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:09,070
You don't have any hair.

737
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:11,370
Not even one.

738
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:15,210
Get out. This alcohol smell...!

739
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:18,110
I smell?

740
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:24,990
I can't smell anything. It's not me. It's probably you.

741
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:27,090
Stop it.

742
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:29,590
Stop what? What did I do?

743
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:30,970
What did I do that I should stop?

744
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,150
Stop it already!

745
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:35,450
What did I do that I should not do anymore?

746
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:37,950
Are you going to continue to be ruined?

747
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:40,870
How did you turn like this?

748
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:45,810
You weren't like this when I first met you.

749
00:56:45,810 --> 00:56:48,210
You didn't do this back then.

750
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:53,650
You were bright and shy, but still considerate and warm.

751
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:55,770
Did long years make you this way?

752
00:56:55,770 --> 00:56:57,930
Did time make you this way?

753
00:56:57,930 --> 00:56:59,810
Don't talk about someone else and look at yourself.

754
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:02,830
Who made me become like this? Who?

755
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:05,310
Your life turned like that because of you. Who else made you this way?

756
00:57:05,310 --> 00:57:08,110
It's because of you! You!

757
00:57:08,110 --> 00:57:10,210
This I know for sure!

758
00:57:10,210 --> 00:57:14,090
Stop it. What would a drunk person do. Get out!

759
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:19,730
Get out? Are you that superior? You always say to get out.

760
00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:23,810
Fine. I will leave, you bastard.

761
00:57:24,490 --> 00:57:27,310
Things are becoming more and more interesting. You are even cursing now.

762
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:30,430
You're so stuck-up.

763
00:57:31,290 --> 00:57:33,830
Jang Won Shik is so stuck-up.

764
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:24,650
You can change your background. If I change just because my background does, then that's not me.

765
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:34,050
Have you made it yet? Your dream into reality?

766
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:42,700
Your reality is my dream.

767
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:45,500
Just wait. I'll be there.
