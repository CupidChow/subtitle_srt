1
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,760
Have you been loving, not me, but my conditions all this time?

2
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,900
Your father's company

3
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,600
isn't worth it for me to invest both my heart and mind.

4
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,860
Look her up for me, Taejin Group's daughter Jang Yoon Ha.

5
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:04,310
Let's see who becomes the real winner. I'll start with marriage.

6
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:07,120
I'm going to marry the girl I have the arranged date with today.

7
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,090
There are lots of rumors floating around that President Jang is going to put Yoon Ha on the succession list.

8
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:16,350
You can change your background. If I change just because my background changes, then that's not me.

9
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,520
Have you ever made it happen? Dream to reality?

10
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:28,250
Your reality is a dream to me.

11
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,880
Wait. I'll go to you.

12
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,370
High Society
Episode 6

13
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,440
The president asked to see you.

14
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,700
I don't want to move.

15
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,400
Then what should I do?

16
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,910
You!

17
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,020
Aigoo, aigoo! This, this! Oh, no! Aigoo!

18
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,080
There's no hair!

19
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,360
There's none at all.

20
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,600
Just how are you assisting your master that she's like that?

21
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,120
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,080
If she causes a commotion after drinking again, I'm going to strike you in the neck.

23
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,410
Are you sober?

24
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,130
Yes.

25
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,680
Sit.

26
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,860
Are you going to continue with the crazy act?

27
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:31,240
Seriously. How is your face so different from yesterday? Are you going to drink again?

28
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,460
No.

29
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,130
Do you want to ruin ourselves all together?

30
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,410
We're already ruined...

31
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,590
What?

32
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,640
Nothing.

33
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:45,770
Keep in mind I will be making Yoon Ha work in the company.

34
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,030
Okay.

35
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,450
What about breakfast?

36
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,910
It's all ready.

37
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,420
Where's Yoon Ha?

38
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,140
Butler Hong went to get her.

39
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,780
Because you are losing your mind, she's doing the same.

40
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,740
Yes, Ajusshi?

41
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,880
Where are you? Do you know how surprised I was?

42
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,340
I wanted to call to say I wasn't going to go home, but I didn't know who to call.

43
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,880
Even if I don't go home, there's no one looking for me.

44
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,620
Do you come home because someone looks for you? You come home because it's home.

45
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,240
Where are you? I'll go pick you up.

46
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,660
No. I'll go in myself.

47
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,540
I finished thinking. I'll see you later.

48
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,870
Joon Gi?

49
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,210
But still, there's no one but you.

50
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,530
It was hard because there was nothing to write about.

51
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,630
It's nice to see your face even this way.

52
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,530
Do chaebol daughters make news content?

53
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:39,210
You already know... Rather than economic news, these types of news have a lot of clicks.

54
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,690
Taejin Group's youngest daughter, Food Market part-timer.

55
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:45,270
On top of that, single. This is no joke!

56
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,950
What's your relationship with her?

57
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,100
Up to there.

58
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,460
Jang Yoon Ha

59
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,850
Just a moment.

60
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,290
Where did you go?

61
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,750
I'm out biking and just meeting an alumni.

62
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:05,090
I'm hungry. You didn't eat already by any chance, right?

63
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,430
I'll make you some breakfast when I get back.

64
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,530
Hurry. I'm hungry.

65
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,820
You came?

66
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,960
Why are you standing around?

67
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,760
It's new and weird.

68
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,940
Because you made dinner last night, today's breakfast is my turn.

69
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,060
You can do these kinds of things, too?

70
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,960
I studied abroad in China.

71
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,840
When the house keeping Ajumma went on break, I made myself food.

72
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:45,020
I emptied out the refrigerator. There is spicy pork bulgogi.

73
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,720
Oh! Your mom seems to be a good cook.

74
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,760
Her kimchi is art. Soybean paste tasted good, also.

75
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,990
I'm okay.

76
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,810
What is okay?

77
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,850
We need to turn off the stove.

78
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,270
It's less than what I expected.

79
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,430
What did you expect?

80
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:18,230
Not something specific, but things a man and woman can do when they're in together at one place?

81
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,530
For example?

82
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,290
Like this.

83
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:34,130
I think men and women are interesting.

84
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:38,570
How can they become this close this quickly?

85
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:44,850
How can they form trust like this so quickly?

86
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,430
I'll come after washing up.

87
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:58,370
Do you know this? This new me is really weird, but I like it.

88
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:01,690
Wanting to volunteer to be a slave.

89
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,090
I'm usually not that type of woman.

90
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,820
That's not something that's really good, changing from what you were before.

91
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,320
I like you telling me things in an objective way, too.

92
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,840
What would you not like?

93
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,100
That's not it.

94
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,980
Today, I'm going to quit my job at the market.

95
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,000
Yoon Ha didn't come back in last night.

96
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,480
She must be at a friend's house.

97
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,700
She even stays out at night without a word, now?

98
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,460
She said she would come in later.

99
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,240
She's an expert on getting on my nerves.

100
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,960
Ye Won says she's coming.

101
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,460
She wants to meet President and you together.

102
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,900
What's up with her now?

103
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,860
My children, they are all the same...

104
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,720
Please gather mother and father to the living room

105
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,160
and tell all the people working to get out.

106
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,220
Okay.

107
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,380
Appoint Yoon Ha as Team Leader of the Strategy Department in the Chinese office this week.

108
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,240
Okay. What should we do about Han Nam Dong?

109
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,730
Tell her that I'll be visiting later.

110
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:33,590
Why did Gyeong Joon get stocks for Yoon Ha?

111
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:38,710
It seems like Yoon Ha had an interest in managing the company since long before.

112
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,060
Does she still go out to her part-time job?

113
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,650
Yes. She continues to go out.

114
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,590
Where did you say it was again?

115
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:48,130
It's Yoomin Department Store.

116
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,650
Later, tell her to come to the company.

117
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,570
Okay, President.

118
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:57,550
Executive Director Jang Ye Won has arrived.

119
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,630
What do you have to tell us?

120
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,420
Divorce?

121
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,770
I already finished discussing it with the kids' father.

122
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:15,350
I gave all the parental rights and custody to him.

123
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:18,860
There's a disagreement with the alimony and division of our assets. So, we are currently settling that.

124
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,250
Divorce is a no.

125
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,360
I already told you before. There are no feelings between us-

126
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,210
Do couples live together by feelings? They live together by law.

127
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,370
There's nothing to gain from living together by law.

128
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:32,040
Is it that hard to live with a proper family?

129
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,610
When Father-in-law was in court for his secret slush fund,

130
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:39,120
he was upset that Father didn't help out.

131
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,460
He took me in as a daughter-in-law because their company needed Taejin Group to act as their insurance,

132
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,660
but he came to the conclusion that it was an unnecessary insurance

133
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,920
and changed a bit.

134
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,470
Then, what is the benefit you can gain from a divorce?

135
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,310
I secured enough funds to set up at least one subsidiary company under Taejin Group.

136
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,230
What are you gonna do about the kids' heart getting hurt?

137
00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:00,260
Not divorcing and living together isn't necessarily good for the kids.

138
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:04,630
The kids' father loves his children to death. I can just meet them every once in a while.

139
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,610
There are no worries concerning the kids.

140
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,990
I'll come into the outbuilding Gyeong Joon used to use.

141
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:14,160
I want to live next to my parents as the eldest daughter of the household wholeheartedly.

142
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,890
Not the outbuilding.

143
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:20,570
It's Gyeong Joon's residence. No one can enter that area.

144
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,470
Your mother is like that right now.

145
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:33,330
Go persuade her. Use the outbuilding yourself. That way she'll get her head on straight.

146
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,140
Mom.

147
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,500
Why? You finished what you had to say.

148
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,400
Why did you come here if you were just going to notify us?

149
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,420
It wasn't a situation where I could consult you. You were grieving.

150
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,850
You talk about divorce when you already knew that?

151
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:04,940
Can't you live a proper life? What would other people say?

152
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,510
Think about how much gossip there would be.

153
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:09,570
Should I suppress myself because I'm afraid of what other people might say?

154
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:13,280
If my situation was the same as yours, I would suppress myself like you do.

155
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,380
But that's not it for me.

156
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,160
There are no in-laws that are holding onto my ankles. I have done my work at the company up until now.

157
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,750
But why should I suppress myself?

158
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:23,830
I got it. I got it, so do whatever you want.

159
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:28,860
Is Gyeong Joon your only child? Don't you even care about your other children?

160
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,540
Will you care about your other children when they pass away and die, too?

161
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:37,470
Look at us, too. Don't you think about how your other children get hurt because of your favoritism?

162
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,000
What type of favoritism did I have?

163
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,160
Then why don't you let me into the outbuilding?

164
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,370
I said I want to live with you, with my parents. Why don't you let me do that?

165
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,380
That's a different problem.

166
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,660
What's different?

167
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,920
After I live there, if Gyeong Joon comes back then I can just let him live there.

168
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,480
Why do you make me into a bad person?

169
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:23,410
Tell her not to touch Gyeong Joon's stuff and just do remodeling.

170
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,620
Yes.

171
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,310
It's just the fate of parents to eventually lose to their children.

172
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,870
Would it be different just because it's me?

173
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,830
Did Ye Won leave?

174
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:44,610
Now where did she buy this?

175
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:47,430
It's the first time I'm seeing this brand.

176
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:51,410
She sure does choose things that are pretty.

177
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:53,080
Yoon Ha!

178
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,060
Unnie, I'm here!

179
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,440
Why are you here?

180
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,330
She was acting so righteous all this time by herself. But now we find clothes she bought and she didn't even take the tags off.

181
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,010
Did Yoon Ha leave?

182
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:13,730
Unnie, how's this?

183
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,870
Aren't you even worried?

184
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,140
Are you worried?

185
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:22,400
Don't be so fake when it's just the two of us.

186
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,400
Jang So Hyeon!

187
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,180
Is there more to life? Let's just live happily.

188
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,790
My brain hurts. Now that elder brother is like that,

189
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,320
I get the feeling more and more that I'm living well.

190
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,210
Are you saying this knowing that Gyeong Joon bought company stocks with Yoon Ha's name?

191
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,590
What do you mean by that?

192
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:42,230
The fact that Yoon Ha left the house, there's something to it.

193
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,970
Now that I think about it, last time...

194
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,900
Won't you let go?

195
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:57,710
I don't move until I am completely ready.

196
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:02,310
When I am ready I will leave even if you tell me not to.

197
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:05,770
So until then just stop getting on my nerves.

198
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,330
So then that means this has been planned.

199
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,370
That's true.

200
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:20,050
Anyway, she's not average. Back then I just let it go.

201
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,610
She acted just like what she said.

202
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:26,020
But why now? Why did she leave now?

203
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,670
Do you still need more time?

204
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:38,180
I'm finished. You can open the door.

205
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,740
Are you putting on makeup?

206
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,130
I'm done.

207
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,190
Let's go.
- Yes.

208
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,250
What do we do about that?

209
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,910
I'll clean it up later. Don't worry.

210
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,960
I will come by later and clean it up.

211
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,980
I don't like leaving things behind for others to clean up.

212
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,340
That type of person says that she suddenly wants to quit?

213
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,640
You should tell them at least a week beforehand that you're quitting.

214
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,170
If I make a decision, I don't even want to waste 1 minute.

215
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,700
If you criticize me that I have no sense of responsibility, I will accept it.

216
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,910
What are your plans from now on?

217
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,570
First, I'm going to pack my things and leave.

218
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,970
Come to my house then.
- No.

219
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,790
You slept on the sofa because of me.

220
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,280
Then what are you going to do?

221
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,000
I may be silly and naughty but I'm still a chaebol daughter.

222
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,410
I have a resort and villa under my name.

223
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:27,620
Silly and naughty person like you can live like that alone?

224
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,910
Not having to worry about money seems spurious, doesn't it?

225
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:34,070
People like you who grew up under parents with a good relationship

226
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,960
don't understand.

227
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,500
Seriously.

228
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,830
Where are you?

229
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:47,380
Where else would I be? I'm at work.

230
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,920
Do you want to briefly have some tea and then work?

231
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,560
Sure!

232
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:54,630
Where should we meet?

233
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,650
Is he already here? Come in.

234
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,250
What are you doing?

235
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,010
Congratulations. Don't forget how good I've been to you.

236
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,150
What are you talking about?

237
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:13,930
Although you probably won't be able to marry the director, you'll still get one heck of a life from dating him.

238
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,570
Manager!

239
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:16,620
Executive Director wants to see you.

240
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,920
Why does he want to see me?

241
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,870
It comes out a lot in dramas.

242
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:23,440
He would say "Don't date my younger brother" and he would give you money or throw a glass of water at your face.

243
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,420
If he gives you money, take it. The only thing that remains from this type of relationship is money.

244
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,050
I'm comforting you in advance. There's only me, right?

245
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,530
Give the flower to your wife.

246
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:34,280
Oh my. I haven't gotten married yet.

247
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,040
Oh, I didn't know.

248
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,040
Weren't you being nice to me because you thought I wasn't married?

249
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,280
Oh, I'm guessing you don't know that when I look at a guy, I only look at their face.

250
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,230
That's why you like me.

251
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,830
Which floor is the Executive Director's room?

252
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,250
Follow me.

253
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:57,540
You will be assigned to the Planning Department and you'll only visit the Food Department once in a while?

254
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,170
Probably.

255
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,860
Unfortunately, the door has opened.

256
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,210
I'll get off now.

257
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,890
Yes, this is Jang Yoon Ha.

258
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:24,700
President asks for you to come to the company by 3pm.

259
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,730
Okay.

260
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,910
Miss Lee Ji Yi is here.

261
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,800
Welcome. Sit down.

262
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,090
What type of tea would you like to have?

263
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,670
I don't need to drink any.

264
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,890
Ice tea tastes good. Get us some ice tea.

265
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,340
Okay.

266
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,880
I'm kind of embarrassed.

267
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,130
Did I look at you too obviously?

268
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:12,360
I'm sorry. I was curious about what kind of lady Chang Soo was meeting.

269
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,380
Don't take it too seriously.

270
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,590
We're young and there's nothing promised.

271
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:21,620
That shouldn't be. Try to get along with Chang Soo.

272
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:26,940
I'll help you two. If there's anything in your way as a couple, I'll get rid of it for you guys.

273
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,890
If the people above act too harshly, having a child first is also something you can do.

274
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:36,510
I'm on your side. Trust me.

275
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:39,230
If you're done speaking, may I leave?

276
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:41,390
Isn't being a part-timer uncomfortable?

277
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:45,690
I'll tell the HR Department to get you a permanent position.

278
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:57,400
Manager? I have something to tell you.

279
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,860
What is it?

280
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,490
I'm quitting.

281
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:05,780
I should be telling you a week beforehand, but since you can quickly hire a new part-timer,

282
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,500
I feel light at heart.

283
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,860
From when are you saying you're not going to come?

284
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,090
I was going to leave after telling you right now.

285
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,830
Right now? Now?

286
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,200
Do it, then. I'm letting it go since you're close with Deputy Choi.

287
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,490
I have to look good to Assistant Manager Choi, too.

288
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,280
You know that I have that type of relationship with Assistant Manager Choi?

289
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,230
All of the company workers know. I was the first to know and I spread the word.

290
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,390
Oh...

291
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:37,710
Get yourselves together. Both of you friends, really.

292
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,310
Even if you meet a man, you should match your status at least to some extent.

293
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:44,670
Even when you were a part-timer, challenging customers...

294
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,910
But compared to Lee Ji Yi, you're not much.

295
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:49,750
How can she with the director?

296
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,300
Ji Yi is dating the director?

297
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,700
You didn't know?

298
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,520
I didn't know.

299
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,640
The outside already?

300
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,220
She's meeting the director, a completely different class from an assistant manager.

301
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:07,160
Basically, because the classes are too different she's not playing with you anymore.

302
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,320
You know well that Ji Yi isn't that type of girl.

303
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,180
You picked the better choice.

304
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,280
Realistically, there's more of a chance for you guys to get married in the future.

305
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,080
The director and Lee Ji Yi are 100% "the end!"

306
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,200
If they get married, I'll fry my palms (commonly used saying).

307
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,300
Fry my palms, fry my....

308
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,420
Act as if you didn't see that.

309
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,900
There's a guest waiting for you inside.

310
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,640
Who?

311
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,220
She said she was your friend. Miss Jang Yoon Ha?

312
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,620
Okay.

313
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,260
Deputy Choi Joon Gi will come up in 10 minutes.

314
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,840
Just send him in when he comes up.

315
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,510
Why are you here? Are you not working?

316
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:59,060
I quit today.

317
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:04,910
I guess the word that you were entering the company was right. I heard you were going towards the Chinese department.

318
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:07,330
How do you know better than I do?

319
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:09,490
The floor is crowded.

320
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:10,810
When will you start there?

321
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:11,890
I won't be there.

322
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:13,670
You won't?

323
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:18,290
Let's talk about me later. What are you going to do about Ji Yi?

324
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:20,450
What should I do about what?

325
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:21,370
Are you dating with her?

326
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:23,190
We're dating.

327
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,730
Do you have any thoughts to marry her?

328
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:29,930
Aish, so old-fashioned. Why are you asking that, too?

329
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:33,370
Did all the people in your house marry because they dated?

330
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:37,930
It's because I'm worried about Ji Yi getting hurt.

331
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:42,310
I know I'm not in a position to tell you guys what to do and what not to do, but...

332
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,690
If you're not in that kind of position, then don't.

333
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,790
I like Ji Yi, more than any other woman I've dated before.

334
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:57,210
I can't guarantee a marriage. Ji Yi agreed to that, too.

335
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:02,830
She got called up by your brother. Rumors are flying within the company.

336
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:07,410
Ji Yi is a valuable friend of mine.

337
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:10,890
If she's going through a hard time and asks for help,

338
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,770
I'm going to help as much as I can.

339
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,770
You had a guest.

340
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:30,510
Uh, you two know each other, right? Part-timer Jang Yoon Ha. She said she quit today.

341
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:36,190
I'll be leaving.

342
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:38,190
Leave.

343
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,820
Why?

344
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,460
Should I go to meet Ji Yi first,

345
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:01,800
or do I have to go to my brother first to fix him up a bit?

346
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,120
I heard you met the director's brother.

347
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,960
How did you know?

348
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,460
The entire Food Team knows. The Speakerphone Manager announced it to everyone.

349
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:32,050
I didn't even tell you that I was dating the Director yet.

350
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:35,130
Now this happened.

351
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:38,640
Why the Director of all people?

352
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,460
Then why is it Choi Joon Gi for you?

353
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,880
Let's not say things about the people we love.

354
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,240
But still, the Director...

355
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,960
I know he's a bad guy...

356
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,620
But what can I do? I still like him.

357
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,700
Do you know how hard I tried to not like him?

358
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,700
I'm sorry.

359
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,620
Don't forget that I gave up Choi Joon Gi for you.

360
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:12,580
I won't forget. Thanks.

361
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:16,590
I told fate,

362
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:22,250
"Give the good guy to Yoon Ha and I'll take the bad guy."

363
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,190
You're having fun.

364
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,550
I support your love.

365
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:32,090
Why can't you support my love?

366
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:40,170
I support it, I support it. I support whatever you do, Lee Ji Yi.

367
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:41,970
I love you.

368
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:49,090
I have something to tell you, about my family background.

369
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,270
Director Jerk

370
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,910
Let me hear it later, Yoon Ha.

371
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:55,710
When we meet men, men come first, okay?

372
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:57,590
I'm...

373
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,050
a daughter of Taejin Group.

374
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:03,710
Okay. I'm Bill Gates' daughter. Watch over here for me.

375
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:04,710
Watch it for me!

376
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,750
Hey!

377
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:10,710
She's so absent-minded.

378
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:34,150
You already came?

379
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:34,970
You came?

380
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,690
How does the opposite happen?

381
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:39,150
Your brother really made me feel terrible.

382
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:42,160
Take a breather and then talk. Are you saying everything as soon as you come?

383
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,120
He took a fancy to me,

384
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,140
but I really felt terrible.

385
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,490
You said that twice.

386
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:54,790
I felt really terrible after meeting him,

387
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:00,430
but it got all better after I talked to Yoon Ha before I came up.

388
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:04,710
I didn't think you'd believe me if I said I was okay with it in the beginning.

389
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:09,650
It seems like you feel better about something really easily.

390
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:13,370
If I don't feel better, then I'd be tied down.

391
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:16,710
I don't want to be tied down by your older brother.

392
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:25,780
I think I can see you as a human now.

393
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,940
At first, because the worlds we lived in were so different, it was kind of meh,

394
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:35,980
but after looking at your brother, he's just someone I see often on the streets.

395
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:44,580
I feel more confident. There's not much to it. People all live the same.

396
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:48,620
I don't know what I should say.

397
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:53,260
It's okay. We're dating.

398
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,220
If it becomes too hard when dating, we can just break up.

399
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:02,420
It's better than breaking up a marriage so it's okay...

400
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,840
because we're dating.

401
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,240
Why are you covering my face?

402
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:21,310
To say that I'm sorry.

403
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:24,530
I'm too sorry to say it while looking at you in the eye.

404
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:33,930
An apology is something that you're supposed to say looking at the other person in the eye.

405
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,170
Do it again.

406
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:46,610
Let's go. If I call you later, pick up. I'll give you a reward.

407
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:51,810
It's nice to have this type of thing every once in a while, even getting a reward.

408
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:54,980
But this is a joke.

409
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:58,280
I hope this type of thing doesn't happen again.

410
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:12,830
I finished writing the news article. Thanks, every time!

411
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:15,930
The idea that a chaebol's daughter is a part-timer, wow. It was new.

412
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:18,670
My performance results at work will go up for sure.

413
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:25,190
Are you really leaving your house?

414
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:28,090
Yes. It was something I planned for a while now.

415
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:31,510
I don't really understand why though. Why can't you make use of what you have?

416
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:33,670
You have a head start.

417
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:35,870
Why are you trying to go back to where everyone else is and start with them?

418
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:40,670
I told you already. My background is not me.

419
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,280
See me for a moment

420
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,840
You leave your place empty really well.

421
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,650
I told Yoon Ha to take care of it for me though.

422
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:10,850
Did something happen to your friendship? Jang Yoon Ha quit.

423
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,630
I knew already, but she has no manners.

424
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:17,210
She didn't even give me time to adjust and just quit. Aish.

425
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:30,290
I'm going to go to your home.

426
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:33,970
Did you call me just to tell me that you were going to wash the dishes?

427
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:41,940
Ji Yi... got insulted by Chang Soo's brother.

428
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,490
I know.

429
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:49,690
There's a family ambience that Chang Soo and I know about even if we don't talk about it.

430
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:52,970
I'm friends with Chang Soo. I know what ambience you are talking about.

431
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:57,930
Since birth, you guys live a life where it's normal to order others around.

432
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,370
When you're meeting with me,

433
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:07,480
I will make sure that there isn't a situation where you are insulted by my family.

434
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,370
Were you frightened after looking at Ji Yi?

435
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:17,350
Did you already forget?

436
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:24,910
Real pride doesn't get hurt by other people.

437
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:28,860
I don't care what other people say. A person like me who went from rags to riches,

438
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:32,960
I feel more determined when people say things about me.

439
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,980
In order to go from rags to riches, you need to break away from common norms.

440
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:43,370
I want to be with you... forever.

441
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:49,380
Can't you leave those words for me to say?

442
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,890
If you say everything, there's nothing for me to tell you.

443
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:54,610
Thank you.

444
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:55,880
About what?

445
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:00,400
Up until the moment that I stepped outside yesterday morning, I was feeling gloomy.

446
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:06,150
But now that I've met with you again, I've gained motivation.

447
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:08,570
Now, I'm really going to leave.

448
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,310
I will drop you off.
- Do you have time?

449
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:14,310
I can just make time.

450
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,910
You scared me!

451
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:25,510
Why were you so shocked?

452
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,260
It's been a long time.

453
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,430
When I went to your house last time, you weren't there.

454
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:38,460
I see mom and dad everyday. On the weekends, I should hang out with other people.

455
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:41,630
Last week, father praised you.

456
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:44,910
Ever since you were young, father adored you.

457
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:47,810
Why did you call over Lee Ji Yi?

458
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:50,710
Did she already tell you?

459
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:53,950
You guys communicate very well.

460
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,220
Do you really want to do this?

461
00:32:55,220 --> 00:33:00,070
Is it so wrong that I said kind words to the lady that you are dating?

462
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:02,050
Are those kind words to you?

463
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:05,480
I said that I would support your love... because she would get scared if I didn't.

464
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:10,120
You are so cool. I didn't know that you were such a romanticist.

465
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,060
I'm going on a blind date with Hwangseon Group's daughter at 3 o'clock.

466
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:17,580
I'm going to go out and if that doesn't work out, I might just meet with Taejin Group's daughter again.

467
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:23,160
Lee Ji Yi is one of them.

468
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,340
Just one among many.

469
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,970
Thank you, Hyung. There's no one besides you.

470
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:30,230
You really look after me.

471
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:32,640
I will remember this.

472
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:35,140
Chang Soo,

473
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:39,400
you should go and play. Why break your record?

474
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:44,000
I will give you everything, so that you can live until you are aged.

475
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,760
No, Hyung.

476
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:51,090
I'm much younger than you. How can a young person exploit his older brother?

477
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:54,850
I'll work. You can play around. I'll let you play comfortably.

478
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:55,680
Hey!

479
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,510
Hyung,

480
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:00,880
let's not manipulate each other with our partners.

481
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,880
Hyung, you are married.

482
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,310
If you compare our partners, who is at a disadvantage?

483
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,760
This guy, really!

484
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:12,400
Are you happy after fighting with a younger one? Even if you win, it's embarrassing.

485
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,780
You shouldn't have even started a fight in the first place.

486
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:19,350
When you are in a state where you are dating a part-time worker,

487
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:22,410
what happened that you ended up down there?

488
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:25,940
I'm disappointed in both of you, Joon Gi and you.

489
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,770
Are you both starting a part-timer collection?

490
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:30,670
Are all of the market part-timers yours to keep?

491
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:33,240
What are you talking about?

492
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,610
Joon Gi is also dating a part-time worker.

493
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:38,460
She's friends with the part-time worker that you are dating.

494
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:42,200
Do you guys even share girls?

495
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:50,630
Tell Planning Team Deputy Choi to come over.

496
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,700
I understand.

497
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:58,780
You know each other, right? Part-time worker, Jang Yoon Ha.

498
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:01,230
She just quit as of today.

499
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:18,050
Deputy Choi is not in his office right now.

500
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:22,000
Contact him through his cell phone.

501
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:32,150
Do you have someone that you are dating without my knowledge?

502
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,830
Just sleep.

503
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,360
Did you meet your brother?

504
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:43,940
Yes.

505
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,050
If you have something to say, say it.

506
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:52,930
I want to play a trick on my brother. Do you have any ideas?

507
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:57,560
If your opponent's weapon is a knife, you should also use a knife.

508
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:02,550
It can't be something that will leak directly to his wife. Do you have any ideas?

509
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:05,700
I will tell a close reporter to look into your brother's corporation card.

510
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,780
Hyung does use the corporation card when meeting with girls, right?

511
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,750
He probably does.

512
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:13,950
Getting humiliated and getting nagged.

513
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:15,200
Go for it.

514
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,910
I got it.

515
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,630
Joon Gi...

516
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,540
Forget it.

517
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,420
What is it?

518
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:31,210
Don't you have anything to say... to me?

519
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:33,670
What are you saying all of a sudden?

520
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:35,310
It's nothing.

521
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:38,280
Ah, maybe I'm getting older, I'm getting more sentimental.

522
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,850
You do have a sentimental side. Being firm without being firm.

523
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:45,490
Being firm without being firm... what does that mean? For example?

524
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:47,790
For example...

525
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:52,030
Now that you're telling me to give you an example, I can't think of a specific one.

526
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:33,110
What should I make for lunch?

527
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:35,880
Simply, let's eat eel with lettuce wraps.

528
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,210
Alright.

529
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:38,500
Ahjumma.

530
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,360
Yes.

531
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:44,260
After that incident, you have been talking less.

532
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:48,790
Ahjumma, did you already know that I was a second?

533
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,520
I guess you already knew.

534
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,380
But still, you can't look down on me.

535
00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:01,200
If I think about you belittling me in your head, I think it'll flip out from anger.

536
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,840
Would that even happen?

537
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:06,700
But still, it's better being second than being poor.

538
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:11,120
Living poorly with a husband who can't even provide living expenses,

539
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:14,930
what's so good about that? Right?

540
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:19,030
People just live according to the way they live.

541
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:25,560
She doesn't say that I'm right.

542
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:31,480
This is what I get for being a housekeeper. If I wanted to speak out my opinions, I shouldn't be doing housekeeping for others.

543
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:36,280
Even though I'm poor, I live while watching over and protecting the one man I love.

544
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,940
I wouldn't change that to become a concubine for a rich man.

545
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,120
The President will be coming over to eat lunch.

546
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:58,150
Oh, yeah!

547
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:00,730
Ahjumma!

548
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,450
Ahjumma, you can leave early today.

549
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:05,360
What about lunch?

550
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:09,660
President is coming. What can I hide from you now?

551
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,470
Yes.

552
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:18,080
On the 25th, you must attend the 'Keep Running!' Environmentalist Meeting Sponsor Event.

553
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:23,020
On the 26th, you must give a congratulatory message during the rally to strengthen the unity of the 'Volunteers for the Heart'.

554
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,490
Up until the end of this month,

555
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:29,110
can't you just cancel my whole schedule? Tell the foundation.

556
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:31,670
I already told them but they said that it can't be done.

557
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,310
They said that there's no one to replace you.

558
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:35,030
Why isn't there anyone? Just search for someone.

559
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:37,390
They are talking about Yoon Ha.

560
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:41,670
She's already a member of the board of directors and also your daughter, so the organizers will also like that.

561
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:45,080
Yoon Ha never showed up even though she's a member of the board of directors.

562
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,280
So people do not look kindly of her.

563
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,690
Let her do it, then.

564
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:52,210
Yes, I understand.

565
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:54,190
I'm thinking of going to Han Nam Dong.

566
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,200
There again?

567
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,730
I said that I'm going there everyday. I should keep my word.

568
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,890
Why haven't you been coming here?

569
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:14,420
The more things have been upsetting you, the more you should have looked for me.

570
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:24,470
Do you want to go into the room? It's been a long time.

571
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:26,870
Let's do that.

572
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:34,440
Hyungnim came by.

573
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,720
Do you know what that woman did to me after coming here?

574
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:40,170
Do I need to know?

575
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:42,880
You need to know. She hit me. She lashed out at me.

576
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,900
Your wife. Your sophisticated wife hit me.

577
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,280
Ah...

578
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:53,770
I am going.
-Where are you going?

579
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:56,480
What is this? You hit me? Did you just hit me?

580
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,250
I came to rest... It's time to end.

581
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:04,130
Who allowed to you to end it? With whose permission?

582
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,990
Where are you going?

583
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:08,200
I'm going to break it out to the press!

584
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,380
President Jang Won Shik of Taejin Group has a concubine

585
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:14,620
and lived without being treated like a human.

586
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:17,870
Do you think I'll end it easily?

587
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:19,910
Let go of me!

588
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,860
What is wrong with him?

589
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:27,290
What did I do to him that he just leaves like that?

590
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:30,410
May I dare to give you advice?

591
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:33,480
Go ahead.

592
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,330
You need to change your concept.

593
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:38,010
His wife became natural.

594
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:41,630
Before you were softer, but now you're not.

595
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:45,480
President Jang misses the soft now.

596
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,120
This is what it's like living as a concubine.

597
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:01,270
The first wife can do anything she pleases,

598
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,060
but I need to change myself?

599
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:18,960
Should I drive some more?

600
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,820
Let's go further away from here.

601
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:28,700
Do you earn money if you sell a piece of hair in America?

602
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:32,510
If they talked it out, one person would've gotten what they wanted.

603
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,910
What a waste.

604
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:37,150
Since they found out how much they love each other,

605
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:39,830
they received the best Christmas gift.

606
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:44,590
Gyeong Joon, a person's heart is more important than money.

607
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:48,830
You gave a lot of happiness when you were growing up.

608
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:52,390
You just focus on making Taejin Group yours.

609
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:56,870
That's my dream and goal. You'll make it come true, right?

610
00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:02,730
Can't you keep your goal in your life and not to me?

611
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:10,080
My life doesn't exist in this lifetime.

612
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:21,290
This place is the same.

613
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:26,440
Even if I die, the world would probably be the same.

614
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,280
Agassi...

615
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,290
I'm just saying.

616
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:36,310
Gyeong Joon... My son, Gyeong Joon.

617
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:42,360
My baby...

618
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:48,160
Gyeong Joon...

619
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:09,590
Gyeong Joon...

620
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:20,350
If we date and it get's too hard, we can just break up.

621
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:24,460
That's better than breaking up after we marry, so it's okay.

622
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,900
Because it's just dating.

623
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:28,860
I said I'll support your relationship, so that you guys won't be afraid.

624
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:31,780
I'm going on a blind date with Hwangseon Group's daughter at 3 P.M.

625
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:35,920
If I decide she's not my type, I'm thinking of getting back with Taejin Group's daughter.

626
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,870
Joon Gi is seeing a part-timer too. That part-timer is friends with the girl you're seeing.

627
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:45,400
You have a sentimental side. You're sometimes firm but sometimes not.

628
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:58,990
[Mom]

629
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:00,920
What?

630
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,330
You didn't forget about 3pm, right?

631
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:04,640
Can I not go?

632
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,200
You have to. Your dad said that

633
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,550
he's promoting joint construction with Hwangseon Group.

634
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:13,720
Okay.

635
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:35,480
President.

636
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:51,340
How long has it been since you came here?

637
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,010
It's the first time after I was in college.

638
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:55,800
I left open a position for you. Come to work starting next week.

639
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:00,460
Secretary Song will tell you your position and what you will be doing.

640
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:06,010
Thank you for taking care of me until now. I will move out and become independent.

641
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:08,150
What? Become independent?

642
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:11,420
Do it if you can.

643
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:13,790
Yes, thank you.

644
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:16,040
All support from the household will be cut off.

645
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:19,780
I know. All the support I got so far is enough.

646
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:22,920
No. Do the calculations correctly.

647
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,930
You have to give up everything you've received.

648
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:29,620
I did do the calculations correctly.

649
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:34,320
For all of the stress and scars I had while living as your daughter,

650
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,090
I think I deserve to keep everything I received.

651
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:41,040
You'll probably regret this

652
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,790
if you leave home.

653
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:46,210
I didn't come home yesterday.

654
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:48,050
Did you know that?

655
00:46:51,490 --> 00:46:53,940
I have a man I love now, too.

656
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:59,920
I don't want him to be involved with our household and family.

657
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,670
Oppa!

658
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:41,190
Yeah.

659
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:44,530
I saw you. Why are you waving when I saw you?

660
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:47,120
It's been a long time since we saw each other.

661
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:52,710
I came to your group's event to see you, but you weren't there.

662
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:57,380
You got really pretty. You got plastic surgery, didn't you?

663
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:02,400
No. I just lost some weight.

664
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,930
But Shi Hyun, I'm a bit busy.

665
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:09,910
There's a lot of work these days, so I'm leaving.

666
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:13,730
Do you not like me?

667
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:17,130
If that's why you're going, then say that.

668
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:20,150
Yes. Stay well.

669
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:27,390
He's the same as before.

670
00:48:27,390 --> 00:48:29,370
He's still cool.

671
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,510
Huh?
- Oh.

672
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:57,460
Hello.

673
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:04,140
The lady that my son was dating was you, Jang Yoon Ha.

674
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:08,630
You even remembered my name. Thank you.

675
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:10,270
Come here, and sit down.

676
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:12,660
Yes.

677
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:14,070
Joon Gi isn't coming?

678
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:18,950
Oh, I just came to wash the dishes. I heard that Joon Gi has a dinner appointment.

679
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:21,790
Why are you only here to wash the dishes?

680
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:27,630
I didn't mean to, but owe him from yesterday.

681
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:31,230
Don't misunderstand. Nothing happened.

682
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:35,600
It just bothered me that I didn't clean up yesterday.

683
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:38,860
Did you bring side dishes, Mother?

684
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:41,840
No. I came to clean the place.

685
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,920
I got out early from the house I work at.

686
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,460
Oh. You can rest, I'll do the cleaning.

687
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:50,070
No, I'll do it.

688
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:53,600
Mother, I'm younger.

689
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:57,460
I noticed the other day, but you have a pretty smile.

690
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:01,340
Girls with pretty smiles get loved by their husbands when they get married.

691
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:06,320
Oh, so that's why you have a pretty smile.

692
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,790
Yeah, I have a pretty smile.

693
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,650
Thank you.

694
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:15,560
I was tired today, but it's all gone now.

695
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,390
What do you like, Mother?

696
00:50:21,390 --> 00:50:23,300
Shall we go out to eat after we wash the dishes?

697
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:24,670
That sounds good.

698
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:33,410
There are articles about Planning Department Team Leader Jang Yoon Ha.
- What articles?

699
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:38,080
"A chaebol daughter goes to the market" and "Jang Yoon Ha the part-timer" have been on the trending now for a while.

700
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:41,290
The public relations department is getting a lot of calls.

701
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:43,660
How about if we start a marketing concept by connecting Team Leader Jang and our company

702
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:47,840
to change the image of the company?

703
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,810
Do that. And find out who released these articles.

704
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:55,000
Okay.
- Oh, right.

705
00:50:55,040 --> 00:51:00,540
I heard there is a man that Yoon Ha is seeing. Find out about him as well.
- I understand, Chairman.

706
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:27,110
I'm here.
- Where do you want to go?

707
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:30,740
Can I do what I want?
- Go ahead. You are getting rewarded.

708
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:34,990
Then, let's go to the amusement park!

709
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:38,760
Are we little kids? Why an amusement park?

710
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:41,640
You don't want to?
- I don't want to.

711
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:44,930
Then let's not go.

712
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:03,580
That! Let's do that.

713
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,770
Are you really going to be like this?

714
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:14,420
Let's not do it, then.

715
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:19,370
It's so pretty! Let's take a picture.

716
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:21,560
No, I don't want to.

717
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:34,570
♫  Today, in front of you, if I say I love you  ♫

718
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:39,510
♫  When you laugh by those words ♫

719
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:43,920
♫ Maybe someone is sneaking a glance at our love ♫

720
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:49,120
Why do you do something like that? Make sure my face doesn't show up.

721
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:57,470
There are so many hashtags of Jang Yoon Ha.
- Hashtag?

722
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:07,730
She was really the daughter of Taejin Group?
- You found out now?

723
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:12,920
When did you find out?
- I went on a blind date with Yoon Ha.

724
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:18,820
You deceived me this whole time?
- That's not it.
- I really feel dirty.

725
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:23,050
I can stand feeling angry, but I can't stand feeling dirty.

726
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:25,680
Hey, Ji Yi.
- Why are people like that?

727
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:27,620
Do you guys have no emotions toward each other? You guys went on a blind date.

728
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:32,110
You used to like Joon Gi.
- I helped Yoon Ha date him.

729
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:35,990
Since when?

730
00:53:38,270 --> 00:53:40,470
Why are you curious about that?

731
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:44,410
Going on blind dates is not a big deal.

732
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:47,480
Being with you and doing this is a big deal.

733
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:51,450
I only do things I don't want to do when I'm with you.

734
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:53,940
Before seeing you today, I had a blind date.

735
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:59,680
I came to you as soon as I sat down. Do you want to be a woman I go on a blind date with or a woman in front of me right now?

736
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:06,840
Are you really going to be like this? My head is in chaos right now,

737
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:10,260
but I agreed to everything you said to make you feel better.

738
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,010
Thank you.

739
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,890
I will drop you off.
- I'm going to take the bus.

740
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:21,370
Let's conserve time, money, and go comfortably.

741
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:25,480
Take out your emotions.
- I'm going thinking about my emotions and going home uncomfortably.

742
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:40,060
Mother, can I cook the meat?

743
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:43,580
No. Although it may not look hard, there is still a difference.

744
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:47,080
How do you make everything so deliciously?

745
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:49,550
It's cooked well. It looks delicious.

746
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:52,600
Eat a lot.
- Okay.
- You eat anything well, right?

747
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,590
Yes, it's good to eat well.

748
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:59,140
Joon Gi is here! Come!

749
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:04,670
I met Yoon Ha after going to your place to clean.

750
00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:07,640
I heard she slept at your place last night.

751
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:10,290
I heard nothing happened.
- Mom!
- Mother!

752
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:13,670
Yoon Ha, I'm telling you because you might misunderstand.

753
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:15,840
The fact that nothing happened

754
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:19,560
means you don't have any charms.
- Stop. She doesn't know whether something is a joke or not.

755
00:55:20,410 --> 00:55:23,200
That's not true. Mother,

756
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,620
he just talked badly about me, saying that I don't understand words, right?

757
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,900
That seems to be the case.
- This is driving me crazy.

758
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:33,520
It's been a while since I saw my son smile.

759
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:37,400
I heard you have a dinner appointment. Can you eat again?

760
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,080
I will.
- That's good.

761
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,940
I really feel happy today. Eat.

762
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:47,530
Then should I order some alcohol?
- That sounds good.
- One moment.

763
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:52,600
Excuse me! Mother, what would you like? Beer?
- Let's have soju.

764
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:58,750
Where are you?
- Just here.
- Come here.

765
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:05,110
It's a bit difficult right now.
- Joon Gi.

766
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:08,430
Come.

767
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,520
I have to leave early.

768
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:22,930
Why? You just got here.

769
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:24,930
I have somewhere to go to all of the sudden.

770
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:30,480
Then we can just have one drink and leave together. I have to leave soon as well.

771
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:35,240
What about the meat?
- I can take them home and give it to my husband.

772
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:38,320
Do you object to that?
- Yes.

773
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:41,280
It's too little.

774
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:44,550
Cheers.

775
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:06,260
Did something happen?
- Oh, Joon Gi.

776
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:14,080
I'll pour you some.

777
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:29,010
Joon Gi.
- What?

778
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:31,320
I trust you.

779
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:36,640
Why all of the sudden?
- Do you trust me?

780
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:43,720
It seems like you never told me that you liked me.

781
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:51,430
Do guys have to tell each other that they like each other?

782
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:55,340
I...

783
00:57:56,230 --> 00:58:00,700
I think there are 2 reasons as to why people don't express themselves.

784
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:05,570
One. They don't like the person.

785
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:11,560
Two. They don't like the person but they don't want to leave.

786
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,930
Joon Gi.

787
