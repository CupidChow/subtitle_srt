1
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,030
Hello!

2
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,930
Why are you so late?

3
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,970
Were you waiting for me?

4
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,210
You'll have to leave immediately.

5
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,530
What?

6
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,150
There's still time left on the contract. This is nonsense.

7
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,330
If it doesn't make sense, then go to court! Ah, my head hurts, too.

8
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:51,550
Ahjumma! You have to tell me what the reason is.

9
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,050
They said they would give me more money.

10
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,390
Five times more!

11
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,470
What's the problem?

12
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,150
She told me to vacate the room.

13
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,730
Suddenly, why?

14
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,690
I don't know either.

15
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,170
Why are you being like this, really?

16
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:12,670
If you unilaterally breach a contract, there will be legal remedies.

17
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:15,490
I can just compensate for the real estate agent's commission and moving expenses.

18
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:16,690
That's still a profit for me.

19
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,630
Hold on a minute.

20
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:27,970
Hi Lawyer. If a leaseholder unilaterally breaches a contract during a lease period,

21
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,630
one can demand compensations, right?

22
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,990
What is this? You're really going to resort to the law for this?

23
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,150
We will demand compensation.

24
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:38,250
You know how complicated it gets if we resort to the law, right?

25
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,770
Ahjumma! This is not right! No matter how much you like money.

26
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,650
Alright.

27
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,890
Money talks.

28
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:51,670
The person who told me to kick you out for a higher lease is worse than me.

29
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,610
Who is it? The one who wanted to kick you out?

30
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,050
There's someone.

31
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,830
Didn't you say you broke up?

32
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,130
Do you see me as a joke?

33
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,790
I let you get away with anything and this is how you catch me off guard?

34
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:29,450
You...do you like it when Ji Yi is being hurt?

35
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,250
I have nothing to say.

36
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,390
Of course, you shouldn't have anything to say.

37
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,090
I'm going to go meet Lee Ji Yi.

38
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,070
Don't.

39
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,590
I really won't meet her anymore.

40
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:45,930
Really?

41
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,310
You won, Mom. I lost.

42
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:55,030
There I said it. So have some mercy and leave Ji Yi alone.

43
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,050
I got it.

44
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,870
If I don't believe my son, who would I believe?

45
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,390
Me, too!

46
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:17,190
Go! You said you were meeting with your sisters.

47
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:22,130
But what are you going to do? Can you keep living here?

48
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,330
I will.

49
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:27,670
Ah, I should probably calculate this a bit. At our company...

50
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,930
can workers borrow funds for a deposit on an apartment?

51
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,790
Our company?

52
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,650
Yeah, our company.

53
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,070
It's pretty good.

54
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:40,650
It will probably work.
- Will they do it if I'm an intern right now?

55
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,450
I don't think they'll do it for an intern.

56
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,650
I'll look into it tomorrow.

57
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:52,750
You're thinking of lease loans in this situation?

58
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,850
Yoon Ha,

59
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:58,030
you know how I live my life?

60
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,410
Do you know what the method is to not get ruined but live your life?

61
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,430
What is it?

62
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,950
Worrying about money.

63
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:10,590
After my parents got a divorce, I think I was always worrying about money.

64
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:14,310
Not wondering what I'd do if I didn't have money, but...

65
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:18,570
because I don't have money right now. Because I have to scrape up money.

66
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:23,150
Worrying here isn't fear, but reality.

67
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:33,030
After I starteed dating Director Jerk...I forgot about reality.

68
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,630
Yoon Ha,

69
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:43,210
reality is strong. Stronger than money.

70
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:57,410
High Society
Episode 12

71
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,650
Yes?

72
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,570
Mother, I'm Lee Ji Yi.

73
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:24,590
I know.

74
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,690
I'm sorry for calling you late at night.

75
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,970
I have something to tell you.

76
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:33,270
I thought you would like what I was going to say, so I quickly called you.

77
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,030
What do I like to hear?

78
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,370
I got a job.

79
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:43,090
Still, I have to tell you this kind of thing face-to-face. At lunch, please come to the front of my workplace.

80
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,670
Alright.

81
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,470
She's very daring.

82
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,390
I chose it.

83
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,190
I'm not afraid.

84
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:20,550
In return, promise me.

85
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:27,870
That you won't say sorry.

86
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:31,330
♫ As I recall those times ♫

87
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:36,170
♫ My tears are flowing ♫

88

90
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:59,490

91
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:04,450
♫ I have a feeling you wouldn't be able to come back ♫

92
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:11,910
♫ I want to see you a little bit more ♫

93
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:17,210
♫ What am I supposed to do? ♫

94
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,950
Let's stop filming a movie now.

95
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,370
I'm going back to reality.

96
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:29,550
♫ Did we only amount to just this much? ♫

97
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,950
♫ From the beginning, something went wrong ♫

98
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,090
You can't overcome yourself.

99
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:40,650
You can't marry Ji Yi. It's not because your household opposes it or someone is stopping you,

100
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:43,710
it's because you can't allow it yourself.

101
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:50,730
You can never overcome your class consciousness.

102
00:07:50,730 --> 00:08:00,290
♫ All day my heart hurts so much I feel like I'm dying ♫

103
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,650
Let's earn money and buy a two story house.

104
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:10,610
I have to look into loans tomorrow... and lunch is provided at the company. That's a good thing.

105
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:15,250
This is life, Lee Ji Yi. You can't give in to the scorpion like the frog did.

106
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,970
You can't get stung by the scorpion and die either.

107
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,190
Mom.

108
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,590
Mom!

109
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:39,750
Mom, you really are a mom. I really needed you.

110
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,710
Have you been well?

111
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:47,030
Of course, I've been doing well.

112
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,810
I don't have a man I'm dating.

113
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:57,770
I don't want to see a man Aunt introduces. I don't like Aunt doing this.

114
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,350
What is this?

115
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,570
Are you really going to be like that?

116
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,070
How did you know I was getting off work late?

117
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,910
Do you think there's something I don't know about you?

118
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,570
Where are you going right now? You're not going home, are you?

119
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,370
You were trying to do something else!

120
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:48,310
Let's go to my house.

121
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:51,070
Go. Let's go!

122
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,990
It seems we're drinking often lately.

123
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:00,750
I don't know if it's a good thing or bad thing.

124
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,210
It's kimchi stew made with canned mackerel.

125
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:08,370
This is the best with alcohol. Have a glass.

126
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:13,530
Honey, I'm going to get drunk today.

127
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,250
Get drunk. I won't stop you.

128
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,430
I love you.

129
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:30,650
It's unnecessary to say that.

130
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:35,730
I don't regret marrying you.

131
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,530
I hear it as you saying you do regret it.

132
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,800
I do regret it.

133
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,810
I'm sorry.

134
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:54,510
I am so upset

135
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,820
but I only have you to take it out on.

136
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:04,010
I want to pick at your heart and

137
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,470
make it hurt.

138
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:13,600
Do it then. If I can do that for you, I'm happy.

139
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,620
I quit my job at Hannam-dong.

140
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,980
You did well!

141
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,440
I got used to it and it was comfortable for me, but I had to quit.

142
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,050
I can find another job.

143
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:32,840
The madam I worked for wants me to work at her daughter's new house.

144
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,170
She kept asking me for that favor.

145
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:40,560
You are liked by everyone.

146
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,800
I was embarrassed, so I couldn't tell you.

147
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:49,690
I was embarrassed, even though I had nothing to do with the mistress.

148
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:53,460
But today, for the first time...

149
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,890
I envied that woman.

150
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,470
If you have money, you can decorate the facts...

151
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:05,260
You can present yourself as a good person.

152
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,820
You can present yourself as an incredible person.

153
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,830
Then my son can have wings

154
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:17,090
to fly high.

155
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,860
Eat this. Don't just drink.

156
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,900
I'm sorry.

157
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:40,160
No, I'm sorry.

158
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,770
You always do well.

159
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:47,260
Everything you say is right.

160
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,840
You're kind.

161
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:58,360
I like you a lot because you're kind.

162
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,130
I miss Joon Gi.

163
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:35,180
Yeah, recently I have moved to Taejin Group's foreign operation division

164
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:38,740
as the U.S. strategy team manager.

165
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:43,340
So could you help me get Taejin Cosmetics into your malls?

166
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,000
Mmm. Where should I start?

167
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:50,690
Okay. I'll email you when I get in.

168
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,570
The President will not be coming back today.

169
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,440
He's doing things he hasn't done before.

170
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:08,610
He's got my hands tied and is doing everything he wants.

171
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,560
He's the same as always. You may leave, Chief Kim.

172
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,140
Okay.

173
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,920
Miss.

174
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,930
What?

175
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,130
Do you like the President that much?

176
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:28,970
What do you mean? Don't you see I'm being like this because I hate him so much?

177
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:34,480
If you really hate him, you wouldn't care what kind of woman he's with.

178
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:39,240
It's better to be truthful about your feelings.

179
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,820
Since we've been in prison for a long time together...

180
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:46,510
I'm merely afraid of leaving the prison.

181
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,830
I'm regarding prison as the best place to live.

182
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:57,950
Since he said he can't get a divorce, I feel reassured. What is this?

183
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,260
What is Ye Won doing?

184
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,300
The three sisters are getting together, in celebration of Ye Won moving back in.

185
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,710
Ye Won seems like a strong girl in many aspects.

186
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,800
She's gone through divorce without her parents.

187
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,110
She's active when she works, and she's smart, too.

188
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,410
She'll go the whole length with company management.

189
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,380
Don't you have to give Yoon Ha work to do now, too?

190
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,530
How is it going with the man she's dating?

191
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:27,720
It seems like they've broken up. That man doesn't like Yoon Ha...

192
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,650
as much as she thought.

193
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:33,250
She liked him so much and made such a fuss, but she's the one who liked him more?

194
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,200
Be more concerned about Yoon Ha now.

195
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,090
I was going to block her path

196
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:43,190
after Gyeong Joon became like that...

197
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:47,960
They say you can't run away from your fate.

198
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,020
Where's So Hyeon?

199
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,980
Did you forget your appointment with us?

200
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,490
My friend had a problem. I went to her first.

201
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:10,350
You've gotten your friend a job already.

202
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:13,040
You're playing all the dirty tricks, but you're out of your league

203
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,080
Unni, I heard you scouted Choi Joon Gi.

204
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,300
Because he has abilities. Because the company needs him.

205
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,460
Even if he had no connection with me, would you have scouted him?

206
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,540
Do you think you're that great?

207
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,340
That you would hire someone with their connection to you?

208
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,640
Unni,

209
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,810
why did you fight with our brother that day?

210
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:34,600
Why are you bringing up Gyeong Joon?

211
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:48,660
This was one of the things Oppa left behind. I was going to ask right away

212
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,160
but I had to ponder on it for awhile. So here it is.

213
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,530
What is this?

214
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:56,370
The lawsuit I mentioned last time... it had ended. We won.

215
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,250
Of course, because nothing was wrong.

216
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:02,890
Aside from this document, I also have a USB.

217
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,220
I kept thinking about it.

218
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:10,170
This...I think it has some relation to your fight with Gyeong Joon.

219
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,530
It also seems like it has something to do with Oppa's death.

220
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:17,640
So what you think is that Gyeong Joon and I fought because of that USB...

221
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,860
and that's the reason why Gyeong Joon died?

222
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,830
Are you trying to say that I killed him?

223
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,660
That's not it.
- Then what is it!

224
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,640
You bring up a lawsuit that has already ended

225
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,060
and are talking as if you have something. What's the reason?

226
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,920
All the while bringing up Gyeong Joon's death...

227
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:36,430
The trial. We didn't win because we didn't do anything wrong...

228
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:41,030
even though we did wrong, the other side had no evidence so they lost.

229
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:46,870
If they had this USB, the other side would have won.

230
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:51,240
If we had handed over the USB, then our company would have been shaken a bit.

231
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,240
Even so, Oppa...

232
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,050
acknowledged all our wrongs, compensated everything...

233
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,230
He wanted to open a new prospect within the company.

234
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:01,420
What new prospect after the business fails?

235
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:06,680
We are giving compensation to the victims... on an ethical level.

236
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,870
Don't act as if you've substantiated some great justice.

237
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:14,080
Even more, what do you even know?
- I know everything I need to know.

238
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,020
I've been at rock bottom. Don't slight a part-time employee.

239
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:21,760
People get their power from knowing who they are.

240
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,070
You weren't able to equip your identity as a daughter of a chaebol.

241
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,670
So you hid it and worked part-time. Why did you come to the company to work?

242
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:31,920
You should tell father that you can't do it!

243
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,650
It's because you don't have an identity that you don't know your place.

244
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:45,700
Unni, do I concern you?

245
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:50,120
I didn't equip myself with an identity

246
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:54,260
and it's my first time working, but why are you being so sensitive to me?

247
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,080
Do you really think I'd be concerned over you?

248
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,190
I'm concerned because of Father, of course.

249
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:03,320
I'm concerned about what Father's plan is for you.

250
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:08,840
Then feel relaxed. Because I won't follow Father's plans.

251
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,970
Then let me ask you...what is your plan?

252
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:14,750
I dont want to tell you that.

253
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,400
It's not because you don't have a plan?

254
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,120
Jang Yoon Ha, you need a sense of duty to work for our company.

255
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,740
Our company has 5,230 employees.

256
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:29,180
And everyone else involved? They are all on your shoulders.

257
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:33,570
I originally had no interest in the company's affairs.

258
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:38,250
But because you keep being like this...what kind of work the company does...

259
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,450
I have the desire to do it and succeed.

260
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:46,530
Then try then. Leave for today.

261
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:51,400
I don't want to talk with someone who takes promises lightly. And give me that USB,

262
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,460
it's useless now.

263
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:57,480
I will be the judge of whether this is useless or not.

264
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,450
When Oppa left this for me, there definitely was a reason.

265
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:05,460
I know Gyeong Joon well.

266
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,570
He always has to do useless things.

267
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:11,290
He puts meaning in his own way, but what does that change?

268
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,780
We'll have to see whether or not it can be changed.

269
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:19,370
Unnie, I haven't decided what to do with this USB yet.

270
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:27,590
Do you think something went wrong with Gyeong Joon because of an accident?

271
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:31,350
What does that mean?
- His mentality is weak.

272
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,460
He was taking depression medications.

273
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:36,490
He only showed his strong side to you, of course.

274
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:40,720
Why would he have gone on a vacation when things were complicated with the company's slush fund?

275
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,050
If it wasn't an accident, then what?

276
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,860
It's hard for me to say it with my own mouth.

277
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,260
It's not that.

278
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,820
If it wasn't an accident, that's the only explanation.

279
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:01,310
You would know if you thought for a while.

280
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,690
I don't know.

281
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:05,970
The stock he left you, it was through a 3rd person.

282
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:11,310
The USB he left you, it's all planned. Even his will.

283
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:13,820
Is your logical way of thinking, not solid?

284
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,680
Stop talking sarcastically.

285
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,660
What is it that you want by stirring up my emotions?

286
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,950
Planning everything is Oppa's personality.

287
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:27,060
He prepares so that the company isn't affected regardless of his personal affairs.

288
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,830
Then what do you think of the timing of his vacation?

289
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,490
Why would he go on a vacation at that time?

290
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:40,050
That...I think it has something to do with the USB.

291
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,650
What do you think?

292
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,910
I'm sorry for being late today.

293
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:52,630
I'll make sure this doesn't happen next time.

294
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:07,620
I have something to report to you about Gyeong Joon.

295
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,100
Tell me.

296
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,260
The stocks that Gyeong Joon gave Yoon Ha...

297
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:14,940
By the way, a third party named Jung Sung Ho is in Korea now

298
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:19,340
The Jung Sung Ho account is an account suspected to be Gyeong Joon's borrowed-name account,

299
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:22,030
and we're looking into the movements of funds in that account.

300
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:26,330
What do those movements of funds in that account have to do with Gyeong Joon?

301
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:30,870
If Gyeong Joon is alive, we thought there would be activities in that account.

302
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:33,490
Or there can be a clue.

303
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:37,570
I thought I knew Gyeong Joon the best...

304
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:42,580
but I don't know him. There are so many things I don't know.

305
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,020
Are you going to keep doing this?

306
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:50,840
If you hear shocking news...will you be able to handle it?

307
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:55,450
Even if I die from shock, I have to know.

308
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:58,850
I have to know what the ending of my son's life was.

309
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:09,670
Have you completed the investigation on Choi Joon Gi?

310
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,450
Why are you here?

311
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,750
To organize my thoughts.

312
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:34,980
Nothing more came out of investigating Choi Joon Gi. He's ordinary.

313
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,880
His household and himself.

314
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,070
Forget it now.

315
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,200
You knew?

316
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,850
If So Hyeon knows, then everyone knows.

317
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:55,820
Ahjussi...why do you love my mom?

318
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:04,490
I don't love her.

319
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,430
Liar.

320
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:11,050
There are people who protect love with lies.

321
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,610
I've come.

322
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:36,570
You said you wanted to marry him...is it over now?

323
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:40,430
Yes. I won't marry that man.

324
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:43,800
Then search for another man.

325
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,300
Alright.

326
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,840
Alright?

327
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,920
Why are you so obedient?

328
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,860
I don't want to fight about it with you.

329
00:24:54,550 --> 00:25:00,700
I did what I wanted to but...I think you were right.

330
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:06,390
If I live more, I think this man or that man will all be the same.

331
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,250
I'll go up.

332
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:33,970
Hello?

333
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:37,350
Ye Won! It's been a long time.

334
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:39,330
What's the occassion?

335
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,730
Isn't calling me at this time a bit...you know.

336
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:44,650
The President is here.

337
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:48,850
I...thought you were a pretty good child.

338
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:53,820
And that you were perfect as the company's successor.

339
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,780
But I'm a bit upset.

340
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:00,180
I really liked you.

341
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:04,340
I think the Chairman is getting old.

342
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:08,280
He always slept at his house.

343
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,210
Why aren't you answering me?

344
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:12,830
I have to go to sleep.

345
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:16,990
Alright, sleep well. Dream about me!

346
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:24,720
I just kept silent and now they are treating me like I'm a nobody

347
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,620
Ah, that wakes me up.

348
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:31,670
She doesn't get the picture.

349
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,960
Deputy Manager!

350
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,980
Oh, Lee Ji Yi. You came early.

351
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:47,080
You, too. Ah, right. What should I call you here?

352
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,870
I work as the for Foreign Affairs U.S. Strategy Team Manager.

353
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:52,210
Wow, you've been promoted!

354
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,850
How is work?

355
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:57,670
I'm still learning, but I like it.

356
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:01,340
Connect me with Team Planning.

357
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,420
I got it.

358
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:09,420
You're connected.

359
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:17,420
Yes, give the spots 7 and 11 at Incheon Airport to Taejin Cosmetics.

360
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,870
A decision has already been made?

361
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,590
I got it.

362
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:31,250
Didn't you say your uncle works in Ganghui Plaza?

363
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:36,890
We are looking for ways to get our company's products in there.

364
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:40,590
I know. Thank you. I'll email you.

365
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:45,170
Yes, it's Jung Yoon Ha.

366
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:48,090
I've confirmed the duty-free stores in Incheon Airport for you.

367
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:49,060
Thank you.

368
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,600
If you're thankful, buy me a meal once.

369
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,720
I should buy you a meal twice, of course.

370
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,620
I think I'll have to stay friendly with Yoo Min Department Store.

371
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:00,440
You have to bring us something good to stay close.

372
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,480
Can you put some of our cosmetic products in the duty-free store of Yoo Min Department Store in China?

373
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,700
Isn't a lot already there?

374
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,990
Not the high-priced brand, but the low-priced ones. The ones that haven't gained publicity.

375
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,510
Do you gain a lot from it?

376
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:15,630
Yeah, might as well as expand my share.

377
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:18,260
I'll think about it.

378
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:23,400
Ji Yi...she was almost kicked out of her rooftop room yesterday.

379
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,280
Why?

380
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,620
You don't suspect anything?

381
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:34,790
Your mother...is a bit too much.

382
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:37,210
You can't control her?

383
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:40,670
I don't have that much power to control my mother regarding marriage.

384
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:44,110
Then are you going to keep meeting her like this?

385
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:46,230
I have to hang up. I have a meeting.

386
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:48,040
Okay.

387
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:04,020
Let's stop filming a movie now.

388
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,460
I'm going back to reality.

389
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:18,620
I...Deputy Manager, ah no.

390
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:22,680
I really liked you like a teacher.

391
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:26,780
Thanks. Didn't you hear?

392
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,800
I heard.

393
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:33,640
We broke up.

394
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:41,250
It's an expected ending.

395
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:47,190
Why are you not saying anything?

396
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:51,280
Saying something about someone else's dating life...

397
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,650
I'm not in the place to say those things.

398
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,880
You're going up one more floor.

399
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,980
Yes.

400
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:07,050
Wait a minute.

401
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,280
Come in.

402
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:23,650
No.

403
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:32,150
♫ By ancient delight. And riding for a fall ♫

404
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:36,430
After thinking about it...I guess I don't have a reason not to board this elevator.

405
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:42,900
♫ I'm dressed in style. So eager in mind ♫

406
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:49,530
♫ Furthermore distracted by you ♫

407
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:53,700
You two are getting off at the same floor.

408
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:58,690
♫ In dreaming, summer days in bloom ♫

409
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,180
This is so suffocating, I feel like I'm going to die.

410
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,260
♫ And I've got no clue how I could fight that ♫

411
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,750
Director Yoo

412
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,170
Answer it.

413
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:14,680
Okay.

414
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:17,070
Hello?

415
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:20,490
I told the international sales team to look over your products.

416
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:22,090
Thank you.

417
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:35,540
♫ And it's thirty nine degrees in my mind ♫

418
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:39,420
♫ It's thirty thousand miles more to go ♫

419
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:43,510
Director Jerk...so you're living well.

420
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,830
That's a relief.

421
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:57,110
♫ Summer days in bloom. Worth a dime ♫

422
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:13,540
There's one more thing...that I did wrong.

423
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,890
I was the one who created the article...the article about you being a part-timer.

424
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,540
I'm not even surprised.

425
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:29,830
But why did you want that article posted?

426
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:35,570
To get you to go back to the company and work instead of leaving your home.

427
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:39,950
You were afraid that your career dream would get further away from you if I left my house?

428
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:43,680
That was the best consideration I could do for you at that time.

429
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,130
What kind of nonsense is that.

430
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,360
I thought that you were young.

431
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:55,020
The way you think of yourself and the reality separately shows that you aren't able to recognize the reality.

432
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:58,260
When we talked about that last time...

433
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:04,720
you didn't outwardly express your opinions.

434
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:09,390
Because I had to look good to you back then.

435
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:15,410
I though it was better for you to not leave your house. You have been preparing yourself to become independent?

436
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:19,770
I don't know how much money you are coming out with, but I've seen people

437
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:22,550
waste away 10 million dollars that were given to them by their parents in three years.

438
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:28,860
I'll give you a tip. If you want to know whether a person approached you with an intent or not...

439
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:29,980
If I want to know...?

440
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:34,800
A person who matches everything to you...has a plan.

441
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:39,480
If a person has no objective, it's hard for a person to like every aspect of another person.

442
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:45,670
So...because you don't have an objective, you're giving me a tip?

443
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:50,590
No. Because I hope it turns out well for you.

444
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,160
Why?

445
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,650
Why else?

446
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:26,640
Hello.

447
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,210
You're impressive, asking me to come all the way here.

448
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:41,560
I want to confirm one thing, and then I'll tell you what you wanted to hear.

449
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:45,400
Are you the one who said you'd give more money if I vacated the rooftop?

450
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:50,790
No. I didn't do that personally, I ordered someone to.

451
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:56,710
You didn't do it personally. If you did it personally, you won't be able to do that again.

452
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:02,060
I won't meet Chang Soo anymore.

453
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:06,520
My son said that he won't meet you anymore. It seems like you guys are alike, even when breaking up.

454
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:11,700
So...don't come looking for me anymore.

455
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:15,550
If you keep looking for me, I think I'll start to like you.

456
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,730
What?

457
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:21,870
If I start to like you, I don't think I'll be able to break up with Chang Soo.

458
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:26,750
So don't come looking for me. It's our third time meeting now, but I like the third time better than the first.

459
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:30,730
Hey. Are you trying to humiliate me by doing this?

460
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:34,600
You have charms. Didn't you know?

461
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:39,860
Goodbye. Thank you for all this time.

462
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:46,520
What kind of girl is she?

463
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:02,820
Yoo Min Department Store confirmed to me that they are giving us spots 7 and 11 at Incheon airport.

464
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:06,000
When?
- I received a call earlier.

465
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,980
Ye Won had resolved it yesterday.

466
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:15,040
Didn't you say you'd work well yourself?

467
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:20,510
Unni's fast. A person who has worked a lot is different.

468
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:22,420
Is that it?

469
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:26,990
Yes. It's the company's matter, so it's good if it's resolved quickly.

470
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:29,400
Who resolves it isn't important.

471
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:34,780
Among the department stores in Shanghai, I'm targeting Ganghui Plaza.

472
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:40,650
If we can get our products in there, with this as a start, Taejin stores will increase in Shanghai.

473
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,990
Can you do it?

474
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,540
I don't know.

475
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:50,030
Didn't you say you'd be able to do well?

476
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:58,680
Father. I boasted about doing well...but I think it's just a boast.

477
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:07,120
I will let Secretary Song know, so if you need any help, let me know.

478
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:14,500
Okay. Also, I broke up with the man I was dating.

479
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:19,050
So you don't need to be concerned about that man anymore.

480
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:21,830
I got it.

481
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,280
Ahjumma!

482
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,810
Why did you come? I told you not to when you called earlier.

483
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:42,910
You know the saying, "you have to work hard in order to get the person you want in your side."

484
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:47,570
That's why I came. Do you know how hard it is to find a person that's trustworthy?

485
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:49,670
If you try to find a person, you will be able to.

486
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:53,340
You know how difficult it is to find a subjective person?

487
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:56,070
An unfamiliar person coming into my home gives me stress!

488
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:59,970
This is a special situation.

489
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:03,960
Now...we know each other's personal lives.

490
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,130
I heard your son dated Yoon Ha.

491
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:11,530
You knew?
- I found out.

492
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:15,140
What do I have to do with that household?

493
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:20,100
I can't live because it's so uncomfortable!

494
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,310
Ah, it's hot.

495
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:39,340
I can sit here, right?

496
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,800
Sit.

497
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:44,370
Why are you eating so late?

498
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:50,450
I met Chang Soo's mother. Every time I meet her, I see that her eyes are as big as marbles.

499
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,420
Did she go overboard?

500
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,910
Yes, she went overboard.

501
00:38:55,910 --> 00:39:00,140
I was almost kicked out of my home, too. It was a good thing we broke up, huh?

502
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,240
You did well.

503
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,570
Since you're telling me that, I really do think I did well.

504
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:10,640
Why?

505
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,530
I'm a full-time employee.

506
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:13,700
Ah, because I'm an intern.

507
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,100
Oh, I see.

508
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:29,130
Joon Gi moved over to Taejin's cosmetic department.

509
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:30,910
I guess they really were going to get married.

510
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,610
You called me here to talk about that?

511
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:40,280
As he moved, he finalized the selection of spots 7 and 11 at Incheon Airport for Taejin Cosmetics.

512
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:46,120
Didn't he build a lot of connections with international department stores while working at our company?

513
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:49,310
Then tell Joon Gi to come work under you. If you give him a lot of money, he'll come.

514
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:54,780
It's like this now, but I offered him many times in order to take him away from you.

515
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:58,380
If he went for money, he would have come to me long time ago.

516
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,920
I know, so tell me why you called me here.

517
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:09,050
You heard that we are trying to build a department store in Jeju Island, right?
- What about it?

518
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:13,640
He wants to co-build it with Taejin Cosmetics.

519
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:17,630
He asked me to use some connections, so I recommended you

520
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:24,100
You had a blind date with Yoon Ha. If Joon Gi married her, then that...

521
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:29,910
You are the perfect person for that. If you succeed, Father will be very happy.

522
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:32,140
Even if you didn't do anything, he loves you to death.

523
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:34,690
I understand. I'll do it then.

524
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:39,630
Joon Gi will listen to what I say, and I'm close with Yoon Ha.

525
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:43,150
I saw Ye Won Noona before, too. I'll do it.

526
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:45,670
Thank you.

527
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:00,410
It's Yoon Ha!

528
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:10,070
I'll be leaving first.

529
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,590
Okay.

530
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,810
Thank you.

531
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:33,190
You guys seemed friendly.

532
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:37,050
Just because it's not going well between you two doesn't mean I have to dislike him too, right?

533
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:37,890
Of course not.

534
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:41,070
I originally liked Deputy Manager as a person.

535
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:45,890
But... it doesn't bother you with the fact that you know he tricked me and approached me with an intent?

536
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:48,470
He didn't trick me.

537
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:51,810
And you shouldn't be saying that to me.

538
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:54,450
You didn't tell me you were the daughter of an amazing household.

539
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:57,150
When I found that out, did I do anything to you?

540
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:59,590
How could you compare me with Choi Joon Gi?

541
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:01,270
I really liked you!

542
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:03,450
Do you think he didn't like you?

543
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:06,190
If he's a man, how could he not like you?

544
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,630
Do you know how disgusted I feel?

545
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:11,990
When we kissed in the beginning...he kissed me even though he didn't love me.

546
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:15,510
Not many people have assurance of their love when they have their first kiss.

547
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:17,430
That's why people call you a virgin.

548
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:18,310
Hey!

549
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:21,490
One should never be involved in relationships with virgins. So tiring.

550
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:24,670
Then you... do you think I'm going overboard with my reaction?

551
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:28,190
It is a bit too much, since you two were lovers.

552
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:33,970
But I don't think I should be like that towards him, too.

553
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:35,650
I understand.

554
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:40,670
Earlier, Director Jerk called you.

555
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:42,250
Yeah.

556
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:46,190
It was a bit weird. I broke up with Director Jerk.

557
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,150
When?

558
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:51,110
I sent him a text saying I wouldn't meet him again.

559
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:54,030
After almost getting kicked out of my home, I definitely realized it.

560
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:56,990
How could a person think of chasing someone out to the streets?

561
00:42:56,990 --> 00:43:01,030
Even though he's a precious son to his mom, he can't be as precious as I am to my mom.

562
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:05,070
I'm also the precious daughter of a household! Try to understand the Deputy Manager.

563
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:07,110
Understand what?

564
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:10,510
Even though he doesn't express it, his situation is a bit like that.

565
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:14,610
I just understand. Maybe because we're in similar situations.

566
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:17,930
Let's go, we're going to be late.

567
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:32,830
We're doing business together before I knew it! Is Min Soo doing well?

568
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:33,850
You've been well, right?

569
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:35,150
The kids must have grown up a lot.

570
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:38,770
They're younger than your kids, since he got married later.

571
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:40,830
You should come out to our meetings.

572
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:43,030
If you call me, I'll go.

573
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:47,990
There isn't a detailed project plan yet... It's just roughly how it will be.

574
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:51,150
But our company hasn't tried building a hotel yet...

575
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:55,330
If we're doing a joint investment, it'll require a lot of procedures, regarding equity ratio and such.

576
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:58,390
To get a good result through many procedures,

577
00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:01,250
I'll search for it without getting tired.

578
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:02,550
You know Yoon Ha too, right?

579
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:06,730
I have to stop by and see her for a bit. She asked me a favor.

580
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:09,650
But you acquired it through Joon Gi.

581
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:12,950
Really? I didn't know that.

582
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:15,530
Because of me, you're going to get nagged by Yoon Ha.

583
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:17,730
If she nags me, I should listen then.

584
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:23,250
Noona, if you need anything from Yoo Min Department Store, tell me.

585
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:26,410
I got it. Thank you.

586
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:54,630
I came to get her some documents.

587
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:00,010
Then...

588
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:06,550
The text message...

589
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:15,010
You really have manners like a dog.

590
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:24,810
How could you say "let's break up" through a text?

591
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:28,250
I met your mother.

592
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:31,710
I also heard that you told her you would break up with me.

593
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:32,810
She called you again?

594
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:36,870
No. I asked to meet her.

595
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:44,010
Why does your mom take part in our relationship... when we're both adults?

596
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:48,250
I'm sorry.

597
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:53,770
Since we're done filming a movie, let's go to our separate homes now.

598
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:59,170
When filming is over, we say "you've worked hard" not "sorry."

599
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:03,750
You've worked hard all this time.

600
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:16,890
Oh, Ji Yi is here too?

601
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:20,490
I brought the documents you wanted earlier.

602
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:22,490
You're just leaving?

603
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:25,790
You should at least have a cup of tea with us.

604
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:27,490
I have to work.

605
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:30,970
I have some documents I need to take to the U.S. strategy team of international operations department.

606
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:32,570
Work hard.

607
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:42,850
This doesn't look good.

608
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:49,150
The acquirement of duty-free stores... Joon Gi had done it for Ye Won.

609
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:53,950
When I put in the orders, it had already been done.

610
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:56,390
It's okay.

611
00:46:56,390 --> 00:47:02,030
But I thought I'd be really good at work...

612
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:04,290
It's not easy.

613
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:06,770
It's like that for everyone in the beginning.

614
00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:33,890
Do we really have to break up today?

615
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:37,010
I don't think we should break up when it's raining.

616
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:43,850
♫ Please stop smiling as well ♫

617
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:50,390
♫ If I start to want you ♫

618
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:55,390
I don't want to go to that kind of meeting.

619
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:58,270
You need to start going since you started working.

620
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:01,750
Do you work alone?

621
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:06,730
Ji Yi!

622
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:10,430
♫ I’m also pushing you away like this ♫

623
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:13,870
We're going to eat dinner together, so you should join us!

624
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:16,570
I have to work.

625
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:20,510
♫ Please don't come closer to me ♫

626
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:23,990
Um... not right now, but later. I'll call you.

627
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:27,810
♫ Because your warmth will surely shake me up ♫

628
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:31,890
Chang Soo and I have a meeting.

629
00:48:31,890 --> 00:48:32,870
Alright.

630
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:37,030
♫ As much as I am holding back from you ♫

631
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:43,110
Ji Yi, I might become a scorpion to you.

632
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:48,390
Even if I don't want to, I might hurt you.

633
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:07,210
Long time, no see.

634
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:12,430
It's weird to see you like this when I used to see you everyday.

635
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:14,870
I know, right.

636
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:19,810
But Joon Gi, you're using our company's connections too much.

637
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:22,310
If you left, don't over do it.

638
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:25,210
I got it.

639
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:45,730
So love is like this.

640
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:48,990
Even if the problem can't be resolved,

641
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:52,410
it gives me the power to resolve the problem.

642
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:56,490
Love is pretty nice.

643
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:30,440
What are you doing? Weren't you going to bring some documents?

644
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:43,300
Did Chang Soo come here?

645
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,960
May I buy you a drink?

646
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:18,770
Is she not here?

647
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:20,800
She is here.

648
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:59,960
What's wrong?

649
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,320
Even though you're a mess, do your work.

650
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:06,740
People and your children are watching.

651
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:11,280
I didn't drink. Then it's okay.

652
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:13,700
Why are you being so crooked?

653
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,840
You came here first, right?

654
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:18,880
Sleeping at our house no matter what... why did you break that?

655
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:23,010
Our children and other people are watching.

656
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:25,310
I come home and you don't make it comfortable for me.

657
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:27,990
So go again and sleep.

658
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:30,450
Didn't you drink alcohol for real?

659
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:31,890
I didn't drink.

660
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:34,310
You didn't drink but you are acting like this?

661
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:36,030
Yes!

662
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:41,870
Your crossing the river of no return.

663
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,270
Let's go to Hannam-doing!

664
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:58,940
Yes President.

665
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:06,790
My man is so good.

666
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:09,540
These days, I feel like it's really worth living.

667
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:11,410
Come here, dinner's prepared.

668
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:13,250
I will wash my hands first.

669
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:16,570
Then... come this way please.

670
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:26,000
Is the food good here?

671
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,400
Yes.

672
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,860
Ji Yi doesn't know?

673
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:31,840
Do as you like.

674
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,910
Drink slowly.

675
00:53:38,930 --> 00:53:40,470
Yes.

676
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:42,950
Ah, so sweet.

677
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:48,790
You seem to not drink a lot.

678
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:52,350
I drink depending on the mood. I don't go out of my way to drink.

679
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:54,850
So it's like that.

680
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:57,430
Isn't the chair uncomfortable?

681
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:59,570
I'm not uncomfortable, are you?

682
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:02,310
No, I'm comfortable.

683
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:07,220
I really hate people who say these chairs are uncomfortable.

684
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:09,920
As expected our assistant manager is the best.

685
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:17,550
Yes, Yoon Ha.

686
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,160
Where are you?

687
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:25,780
I am with Chang Soo, come here and let's eat together.

688
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:28,460
I don't want to.

689
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:35,380
Yoon Ha

690
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:42,850
Assistant Manager, pour me an other glass please.

691
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:44,790
Let's do it!

692
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:51,980
She's not picking up... She's not the person to do that.

693
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:56,020
What do you mean. She didn't pick up last time, too.

694
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:59,000
Right, that time she did it, too.

695
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,060
When she found out I was a daughter of Taejin Group.

696
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:06,200
She is doing it again to that extent?

697
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,380
Let's go to Ji Yi together.

698
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:22,120
Although there's a lot of controversy regarding meat and health, it tastes the best.

699
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:28,360
Now what will you do?

700
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,920
Let's see what's on the news.

701
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,020
Okay.

702
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:47,020
I'm okay.

703
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:51,150
Aigoo!

704
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:55,210
President! President!

705
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:57,560
President!

706
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,670
Oh Honey! Honey!

707
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:02,710
What to do? Honey, what to do?

708
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:04,350
President!

709
00:56:07,850 --> 00:56:09,270
Why didn't you stop working already?

710
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:12,110
The chairman has collapsed.

711
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:12,750
What?

712
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:15,870
They've taken him to the hospital.

713
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:19,270
Why so suddenly? There was nothing peculiar in his last check-up.

714
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:21,410
I think you should go.

715
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:24,970
I got it.

716
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:29,150
Oh what to do? Honey, be strong!

717
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:31,650
You are gonna be alright, will you?

718
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:33,890
Oh Honey!

719
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:38,010
What to do, my honey.

720
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:40,650
What are you doing here?

721
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:45,270
Madam, something really bad happened.

722
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:46,630
What are you doing?

723
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:47,790
Miss, let's go outside for a moment.

724
00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:50,690
No, Madam, I have to stay here!

725
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:53,110
I have to protect my honey!

726
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:55,690
Madam!

727
00:56:57,610 --> 00:57:00,490
I can't believe it.

728
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:05,470
How did this person... How did this person...

729
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:15,970
Assistant Manager, may I tell you a funny story?

730
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:17,930
Try.

731
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:21,710
There was a frog and a scorpion.

732
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:24,030
One day, the scorpion says...

733
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:26,430
No, maybe it was the frog who said it.

734
00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:30,150
Anyway they cross the river together.

735
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:34,130
Perhaps... the frog carries the scorpion on it's back to cross the river?

736
00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:35,690
Right!

737
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:39,950
But the scorpion is really bad.

738
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:45,870
I originally didn't like the scorpion. Do you like the scorpion?

739
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:47,750
Not really...

740
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:49,450
Right, right!

741
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:53,390
But I've never seen a scorpion except in pictures.

742
00:57:54,410 --> 00:57:56,770
Have you ever seen one?

743
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:02,910
What are you doing Ji Yi?

744
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:08,190
Can't you tell? The assistant manager is taking me home.

745
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:12,130
Chang Soo, it's okay now. Let's go.

746
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:14,210
Let's go?

747
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:18,290
Assistant manager, let's go, too.

748
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:22,170
Meet me one second.

749
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:24,210
I don't want to.

750
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:35,890
Stop it. She said she doesn't want to.
