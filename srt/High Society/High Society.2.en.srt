1
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,470
Excuse me.

2
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,140
Do you know me?

3
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,590
Why are you being like this? Please don't do this.

4
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:04,150
I greeted you but I got rejected. So I got angry.

5
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,500
Hello. This is the greeting that I forgot to do.

6
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,990
You seem to have mood swings. Learn to have some self-control.

7
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:16,700
Is he trying to preach to me?

8
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,060
Listen to his advice. You have a inferiority complex.

9
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:25,290
I tell you every time. People like us who are not well off need to be more careful about our personality twisting up.

10
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,800
Let's go. He's usually shy but chic.

11
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,550
Ahh... That's the guy that you said was shy and intelligent

12
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,450
and elegant and chic.

13
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,170
You were being sarcastic just now, weren't you?

14
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:37,980
No.

15
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,240
No? Then, my bad.

16
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,500
I heard his household is really nice. Rich, too.

17
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,580
These days, the wealthy have nice personalities since they grew up not lacking anything.

18
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,750
Does having a lot of money mean you don't lack anything?

19
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,440
Look at you... hot-tempered again.

20
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,760
Hey, run! Run!

21
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,550
You came?

22
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,950
You should have rested at home. Why are you here late at night?

23
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,900
Don't be mad. After hearing your voice this morning, I couldn't wait, I wanted to see you so badly.

24
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,310
So difficult...

25
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,820
When it dries, put it back where it was.

26
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,650
I put in side dishes in the refrigerator. You ate dinner, right?

27
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,620
If I tell you to eat something, you'd get mad, huh?

28
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,850
Yeah.

29
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:39,160
Oh! You spoke informally to me.

30
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,660
Now you seem like my son. Sons who are too well-off are difficult, too.

31
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,600
Doing things on your own is hard for me.

32
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,480
After becoming a parent, you live like this and I haven't done anything to help

33
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,770
Mother, you did your best so I have no complaints.

34
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,920
You're saying "mother" again... I feel distant from you.

35
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,450
If I say "mom," my heart would get weaker. I fear that I'll give up what I want to do

36
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,290
and live like mom and dad.

37
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:06,360
What's wrong with how we live? There are times we have money and times we don't--

38
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,880
I guess we never had any.

39
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,020
Live doing what you want to do. If you're ever having a hard time, come to me.

40
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,080
I'll take you home.

41
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,680
No, I don't want you to. I'm ticked off.

42
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,900
Eat a lot, be healthy. My son, fighting!

43
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,270
I said I'd take you home.
-I don't want you to.

44
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,600
Oh my god... Mom!

45
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,080
I don't want it! You are probably exhausted from work again.

46
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,630
Let go!

47
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:34,600
Why?

48
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,070
I'm losing to you, Mom.

49
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,130
If I lost to you, you have to lose to me, too.

50
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:44,370
Go home. Let me be comfortable. If you take me home, my deed of cleaning would be on the same level.

51
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:49,830
I want to do more for you than you do for me. I don't want to be on the same level!

52
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,220
I got it.

53
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,260
Fighting!

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,670
I hope you're eating well.

55
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,110
You too!

56
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,200
Be careful. Is wind blowing on your feet?

57
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,990
Why do you fall so easily?
-I know, right?

58
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:20,280
Did something good happen? Why are you smiling so prettily?

59
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,560
You don't smile because something good happened. "You smile so that something good could happen."

60
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,610
Why do you live such a complicated life?

61
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,330
Just smile when you want to.

62
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,410
Isn't it amazing?

63
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,920
You've finally gone crazy?

64
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,750
It's chicken feet.

65
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,580
I'm going to eat you!

66
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,120
Wipe your hands clean first.

67
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:59,290
Why did you suddenly decide to come over?

68
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,580
I wanted to come suddenly.

69
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,020
Did you fight with your mom again? How bad is it?

70
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:11,440
Could there be... a secret about your birth you don't know about?

71
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:30,430
What are you doing? Are you going to stay at home just because it's vacation?

72
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,750
Please do a parentage test.

73
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,370
Parentage Test Gene Analysis Report

74
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,260
Parentage Test Gene Analysis Result

75
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,280
Parentage Test Gene Analysis Explanation

76
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,050
Probability of parent-child relation between Min Hye Soo and Jang Yoon Ha is 99.9653%

77
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,760
Daebak! Cheers!

78
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,400
So you got ruined?

79
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,850
You must have been rich. That's why you'd get to do a DNA test.

80
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,240
DNA tests are expensive, right?

81
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:19,370
Hey, the thing I want to talk about is my relationship with my mom.

82
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,050
How can the test fee stand out to you more?

83
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,540
But still, you doing a DNA test is fascinating.

84
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:27,920
It's like a drama. But it turned out to be your real mom.

85
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:33,320
Sorry. I'm a little out of it right now because of Deputy Choi.

86
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,800
You guys will probably date soon.

87
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,300
How can I want someone like him when I have a monthly rent of $200 with $5000 in deposit?

88
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,570
I'm satisfied with just looking at him.

89
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:44,220
"Boys, be ambitious" (in English and Korean).

90
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,680
Go after him. If you marry that man, you can leave this rooftop and end up in an apartment.

91
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,920
Yoon Ha, even if we don't have much, there are things we can and can't do.

92
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,960
I'm most comfortable making my own money with my own work.

93
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,380
It's not right to leech onto a guy.

94
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,720
Cinderella is not realistic.

95
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,170
What's wrong with leaning on and depending on each other with a guy you love?

96
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,760
It's "on each other".

97
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:13,250
Exactly. "On each other." That guy goes to work at the office and you take care of the house.

98
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,330
It's nice to live comfortably with the money that guy makes.

99
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,680
You're saying ridiculous things.

100
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,180
These days, even the daughters of rich people work.

101
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:27,130
What's with the fuss? And why bring up the rich daughter all of a sudden?

102
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,390
The rich daughter I told you about.

103
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:34,030
Before, she wasn't able to do social media things because she got caught. She's secretly doing it again.

104
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:37,410
This unnie has guts.

105
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:41,720
She's pretty right? She even followed me back.

106
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,840
She even commented to me. Hey, you should follow her too. She'll accept you.

107
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,290
She notices people like us. She's so kind.

108
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:52,450
Hey, what's wrong with people like us?

109
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:56,560
Don't you know how much value there is in taking in all the insults and sweats just trying to make $10?

110
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,940
We're different from these kids who grew up thinking money is always given to them by their parents.

111
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,910
We are different. People like her are always rich,

112
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,960
and we continue to be poor even when we know the value of insults and sweat.

113
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,530
We're not always going to be poor. We save up because we know money is precious.

114
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:17,990
Money you make by your own strength has its own value.

115
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:21,170
What is your true identity?

116
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,520
Me?

117
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,220
A loser who always just speaks her mind.

118
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,410
A failure.

119
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,370
What are you?

120
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,750
What?
- I don't know you too well,

121
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,370
but I like you. You seem like a good person.

122
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:42,620
Love.

123
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,690
This is really good, isn't it?

124
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:50,250
This is my house.
-I want to live her too, Ji Yi.

125
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,890
Can I?

126
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:56,950
High Society 
 Episode 2

127
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,080
Today's table setting will be done in Northern Europe style.

128
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,690
The President is eating by himself so set it correctly.

129
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,620
Madam and the Vice President are eating together, so prepare that.

130
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,880
The younger two daughters eat separately so make their salads separately.

131
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,340
The Pork and Potato Salad is for the President and Vice President.

132
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,420
And the Dragon-fruit Salad is for Madam and the daughters.

133
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,270
Yoon Ha.

134
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,880
I was on my way to see you.

135
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,710
Why?

136
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:29,980
Was Changsoo being rude to you yesterday?
-Why do you want to know?

137
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,150
I wanted to punish him. I know him.

138
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,050
I made him become rude.

139
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,220
The cause doesn't matter. The result does.

140
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:41,630
Wow. You're becoming like father, too.

141
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,080
That's not a compliment.

142
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,290
You're corrupting.

143
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,410
You were a little more harsh that time. It hurts a lot.

144
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,330
Hope you mature as much as it hurts.

145
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,490
Why are you leaving so early?

146
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:56,090
I don't want to get scolded by the new dispatch who comes today. I'm going.

147
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,350
Are you looking for someone?

148
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,260
No. I mean, yes.

149
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,250
Are you or are you not?

150
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,540
I did come to look for him.

151
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,020
Deputy manager!
- Yes.

152
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,690
Do you know her?

153
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:30,840
Yes, she's a part-timer at Food Market. Miss Lee Ji Yi. This is...
- I do nothing and just play around.

154
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,720
In other words, the biggest unemployed. I'm Joon Ki's friend.

155
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,390
Ah, yes.

156
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,770
Didn't you say you were looking for someone?

157
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:43,360
Oh right! Deputy Manager. Since you're a hard worker, you'd obviously came out earlier than the others

158
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,880
so I prepared this thinking you missed breakfast.

159
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,150
Today is your first day at work.

160
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,980
Thank you.

161
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,020
You must like Joon Ki.

162
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,630
No, I don't like him.

163
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,500
You don't like me?
-No, it's not that.

164
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,610
Do you like him or not like him?

165
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,430
This lady has no opinion for herself.

166
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,660
Why are you constantly interfering?

167
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,830
I knew you'd do that.

168
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,930
Oh my, I'm sorry.

169
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,900
But why are you using informal speech with me?

170
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,850
Work hard, sir! Fighting!

171
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,160
What is she?

172
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,510
Be careful, she works at our company, though she's just a part-time worker.

173
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,410
Your jokes were too harsh.

174
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,710
Are you taking her side because of your similar backgrounds?

175
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,950
Her forehead says, "I'm poor."

176
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,760
How dare she try to win you over?

177
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,990
Don't jump to conclusions.

178
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:35,320
If you pretend, it's obvious.

179
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,940
Why do you think I didn't tell her that I'm the General Director?

180
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:42,500
She probably would have tried to win me over with twinkly eyes if I said that.

181
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,230
I always thought only poor people have victim mentalities,

182
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:49,480
but rich people also have the same mindset.

183
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,240
It's not having the victim mindset, it's elitism.

184
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,390
By the way, how are you going to remodel Food Market? Let me see.

185
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:01,640
Changing the main focus of the premium market for middle and lower classes instead of the upper classes.

186
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,720
Instead of placing the expensive items near the entrance,

187
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,210
we should place the loss leader items near the entrance.

188
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:11,960
This tastes really good. She must've made it herself.

189
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,390
Carry on.

190
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,290
This sucks.

191
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:25,900
You offered your sandwich to him without even giving me one and now you're saying it sucks?

192
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,050
Saying they're close friends doesn't help either.
-Why?

193
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:33,520
Deputy Manager's unemployed loser friend just killed my mood this morning.

194
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,650
Are you sure it's not Manager Choi who's a punk?

195
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:38,640
No, it's definitely not that.

196
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,610
Proceed the remodeling with what you suggested.
Okay.

197
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,800
I'm going to the bathroom, so you can go first.

198
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,340
Okay.

199
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:02,530
Do you want me to help you? I didn't talk to you informally this time.

200
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,250
It's fine. It's my job.

201
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,340
The sandwich tasted really good. Did you make it yourself?

202
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:10,450
You ate that?
-Yes.

203
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:13,120
No wonder there's a saying "you make a soup to give it to a dog."
(Korean proverb which says all your hard work goes to waste)

204
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,630
Am I a dog?
-I was talking to myself.

205
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,330
Even his ears are good.

206
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,550
But... you're talking to me informally again.

207
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,220
Wouldn't I be mad when I just got called a dog?
-You're doing it again.

208
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,990
I was talking to myself, too.

209
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,850
Who talks to himself while looking at someone and asking a question?

210
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,680
Because I can't believe it!

211
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,460
I'm not the type of person to be getting this crap around here. If you knew who I was, you probably...

212
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:35,750
Although we don't know each other I'll just say this:

213
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,570
Mind your manners.

214
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:42,010
What was that earlier, too? If you're hitting on someone, do it better.

215
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:44,880
When was I?
-You knew I'm interested in your friend.

216
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,870
How would I know if you were interested?
-Oh, you're not only have no manners, but also unobservant.

217
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,980
A girl gets up early to make a sandwich to give. Plus they're not even close.

218
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,160
Do you know how much courage that took?

219
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,550
I ruined my image to Deputy Manager so early in the morning.

220
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:04,610
But luckily Deputy Manager has an unemployed friend like you.

221
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:08,460
When making friends, instead of looking at class or levels,

222
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,440
it seems like he meets people he's comfortable with. It gives me hope.

223
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,940
Do I look that crappy to you?
-Yes!

224
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,600
Hey, you!

225
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,810
Taejin, Jang Gyung Joon

226
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:22,070
Why is he...?

227
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,880
Yes, Hyungnim?

228
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,050
I can't believe this is a fact? How can you go on like this?

229
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:35,990
Even if it's through someone you know, how could you do that?

230
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,530
I'll call you later.

231
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:45,170
Long time no see.
- Yes, hyungnim.

232
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:48,140
Don't sit. I have to leave.

233
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,830
Why did you want to see me?

234
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:55,990
You met my sister Yoon Ha, right?

235
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:01,960
I gave her some life lessons. Because she didn't attend school in Korea, it seems like she lacked some manners.

236
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,680
Changsoo, Yoon Ha is my younger sister.

237
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,020
It means that a Taejin Group representative met a Yoomin Group representative. Your meeting wasn't personal.

238
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,900
We'll keep life lessons within the family, okay?

239
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,620
Okay.

240
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,600
Good. You make a clean finish.

241
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,990
I already ate. You can order.

242
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:37,520
I'll get right to the point.

243
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,060
Why did you do that? Did you want to win that badly?

244
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,960
Did you want to increase the company's profit like this?

245
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:00,280
You just have to raise the profit using any method. That's father's method.

246
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:04,520
Don't use father as an excuse. This is your method, not father's.

247
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,290
Can you mess up like this just because you want to win?
- I did my best.

248
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:11,440
I just got unlucky. I did a stability test, and there was no defect.

249
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,120
Even if that's true, you have to take responsibility.

250
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,150
If I admit to it, did you think about how much it'll affect our company?

251
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:21,780
You don't know that Taejin is #1 watched by the police?

252
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,190
You want us all to go bankrupt?

253
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,410
You tell father the truth before I tell him.

254
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,830
Do you think father doesn't know?

255
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:35,570
Do you think there's anything the president doesn't know?

256
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:38,220
Aigoo, you naive prince.

257
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,490
You stay out of this. I'm going to discuss this with father.

258
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:44,860
I can't stay out. I'm going to use this opportunity to improve the company's constitution.

259
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,950
That means you're being unfaithful to father's constitution.

260
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:51,920
That's good for me. Please hurry up and improve the company's constitution.

261
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,040
I can't wait to see you being the first person out.

262
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,430
Thank you.

263
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,720
Uh, excuse me?

264
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:15,350
I want to buy rice cakes as a present. I'm going to give it to a woman in her 50's.

265
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:19,180
I heard Korean food markets have everything. Do you have rise cakes? I want them to be soft.

266
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,790
Can you speak English?
- I don't understand you.

267
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,700
Follow me please. I'll show you where the rice cakes are.

268
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,530
Thank you.
- No problem.

269
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,280
What kind do you want?

270
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,970
Soft ones. I'm going to give them to a woman in her 50's.

271
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:42,710
How about this one?
- I like them. Thank you.

272
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,620
She knows Chinese, too?

273
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,620
She's my friend. She's fluent at English, too.

274
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:52,560
If her family was better-off, she would have been employed full-time as an office-worker at a major corporation.

275
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,500
Miss Lee Ji Yi.
- Yes?

276
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:59,000
What do you think the problem of Food Market is? Why do think the sales are so low?

277
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,470
Deputy manager, I don't think about those things.

278
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,870
Okay, I understand. You can go work.

279
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,380
Okay.

280
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:14,390
Construction should start tonight.

281
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:17,770
Please finish it by early next week.

282
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,200
Yes.

283
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,010
You're already done? I thought you were going to eat lunch...

284
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:28,330
Did you get hit?
- I thought nobody listens to her at home, but I guess I was wrong.

285
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,790
She gets a lot of love from her older brother.

286
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,700
What did you do to get hit?

287
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,730
Forget it. I'm in a bad mood.

288
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:38,230
I'll take a quick sweep around the store and go to the headquarter.

289
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,360
General Director, you came.

290
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,460
Ah, continue your work. Let's not make things complicated.

291
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:06,620
That woman...

292
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,740
Thank you.

293
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,000
Hey!

294
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,470
What are you doing?

295
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:34,790
Let's talk somewhere else. People are looking.

296
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,990
Okay, let's go.

297
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,630
Are you doing spy work to get our department store's secret?

298
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:57,440
Well, it's not that excellent to get secrets out of.

299
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,540
-The Food Market concept sucks and the store sucks too.
-Sucks?

300
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:05,170
I think I payed for all my wrongdoings from last time.

301
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:08,360
- You have no objections so far, right?
- I do.

302
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:12,370
Gyeong Joon Hyung called me over and beat me today.

303
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,700
Do you see this?

304
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,050
Do you know how much this hurt?

305
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,580
That...

306
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:26,760
isn't something related to something I did but something you did.

307
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,960
So?
- Please have some manners. Don't speak to me informally.

308
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,290
Fine. Then what is the reason you're here?

309
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:38,180
Did you come to investigate whether I was marriage material, knowing you were going to be set up with me?

310
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,180
Since you ultimately can't marry the man you're meeting right now?

311
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:45,220
I don't have a boyfriend. I'm going to speak informally now, too.

312
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:50,640
Mr. Chang Soo, instead of waiting for you to start giving some respect, I think it'll be faster to drop down to your level.

313
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,070
Mr. Chang Soo?

314
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:55,230
Then what shall I call you?
Don't tell me, Oppa?

315
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,760
So cheesy.

316
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,410
Fine, I am Mr. Chang Soo.

317
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:02,540
My motive is simple. I need a job.

318
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:06,260
But no one would hire me if they knew whose daughter I am.

319
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:10,170
While keeping my secret, this part-time position was the only job that I could get.

320
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,210
You say that it's coincidence... that you are working here?

321
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:16,630
I applied to many other part time jobs besides this.

322
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,460
You are so strange.

323
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:22,080
Why are you hiding and working? You can just tell people in your house and get a job anywhere.

324
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,380
Our house doesn't acknowledge me. You already knew that.

325
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:29,310
Then just go out freely. Start living a lavish life spending money just everywhere.

326
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:31,290
I have a dream.

327
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,470
What dream?

328
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:36,490
We are not close enough for us to share deep conversations.

329
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:41,030
Just pretend that you don't know. I also have a friend here. I want to stay here with her.

330
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:44,300
You said that you listen well to a woman's request.

331
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,900
It all depends on the type of woman.

332
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,100
You want to be my woman? Then, I'll hear your request.

333
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,300
I'll just quit.

334
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:12,410
Are you okay? Do you know that jerk?

335
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:15,250
That jerk is right here.

336
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,900
And watch your tongue.

337
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,240
I am the Director of this place.

338
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,230
What?

339
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:35,170
I said that I'm the Director.

340
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:38,120
I'm not some unemployed punk.

341
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,650
What is he saying?

342
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:45,270
He is the Director of this place, Yoomin Department Store.

343
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,930
Ah...yes.

344
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,550
Well, you didn't need to do that.

345
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:58,500
Then continue on with your work.

346
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,530
Ah, so childish.

347
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,920
How do you know that jerk?

348
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,240
Let's go. Let's go.

349
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,900
Father, it will just take 5 minutes.

350
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,180
Gyeong Joon has the official document.

351
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:55,520
If he releases it, I'll get hit; but this entire company will get hurt.

352
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,810
I don't understand what you are trying to say.

353
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,800
If you tell me to take it all, I will.

354
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,690
But give me a definite feedback of the future.

355
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:07,410
If we sacrifice this much, I believe I can be responsible for the company.

356
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:10,090
Don't overestimate your abilities.

357
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,860
He has arrived.

358
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,630
Ahjumma!

359
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:40,050
Yes.

360
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:44,010
They said my hubby has arrived! You act normal so you don't stand out and

361
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:46,240
when the my hubby arrives, just give him the tea and go.

362
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,080
Yes.

363
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,180
Here, take this.

364
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,250
I'm okay.

365
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,780
No, I left it there for you to take.

366
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:02,380
I like it because you leave things exactly where I place them.

367
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:07,530
There are other ladies I've seen that move things on their own. I really hate that!

368
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:09,210
They are all trying to do well.

369
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:14,070
Ahjumma, you and I are a good match. That's why it has already been 3 years.

370
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:16,100
He came.

371
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,920
Please sit here.

372
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,360
Mom.

373
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,850
Oh, what are you doing here?

374
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:38,510
Oh, I ran from the car thinking that the plane was going to take off.

375
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:41,130
I can just see it later. Why did you overexert yourself?

376
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:44,090
It bothered me that I saw you in that manner yesterday.

377
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:46,790
Give this... to Hae In.

378
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:50,580
Also, tell her that I'm sorry for not being a good aunt.

379
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,500
There's nothing like family and relatives.

380
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,480
How many days are you planning to leave for?

381
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,280
I can't stay long because of the bazaar. Maybe 2-3 days.

382
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:09,840
Ah!

383
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,880
News Flash. Along with Yisan and Jangjin Group, the prosecution

384
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,810
have caught the Taejin Pharmaceuticals establishing a secret fund overseas.

385
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:18,690
If it's Taejin Pharmaceuticals, Ye Won is the president.

386
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:21,820
While examining funds involving businesses overseas,

387
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,940
they found out traces of it during the process of creating a new medicine with a Chinese pharmaceutical company,

388
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,600
there was a secret fund that was set up.

389
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,360
I'm done playing around now.

390
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,510
You are leaving already?

391
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:35,270
This is too much. You come only once a week and you're going to leave after just showing your face?

392
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:37,190
The car is ready.

393
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,220
Are you playing with me? Why don't you answer me?

394
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,400
Yes, I am playing around with you.

395
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:47,280
I'm meeting you to play around. Of course, I would play around with you. Would I live with you?

396
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,700
We're mutually equal.

397
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,180
But there are still rules even when playing around.

398
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,500
That's right. I make the rules.

399
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,960
When will you come back?

400
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,900
I will be back.

401
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,650
Just don't go to prison.

402
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:02,710
Last time you were locked up at the detention center, do you know how frustrating it was because I couldn't visit you?

403
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:05,770
Visitation rights aren't extended to me.

404
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:09,160
You're alive and well.

405
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,270
When are you coming back next time?

406
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:14,610
If you meet other women, I am going to kill them all!

407
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,860
- When is the 9AM NEWS team coming?
-The date hasn't been released.

408
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,500
Call Ye Won.

409
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,880
Before you call my older sister, I need to tell you something.

410
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,090
They are unavailable right now.

411
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,480
Oppa, I have something to tell you.

412
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,880
Let me know when you have time.

413
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,150
Stay at the Pyeongtaek Villa. I will go there.

414
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,570
How do you... know that Director jerk?

415
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:01,260
Just.

416
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,870
Hey!

417
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:06,030
There's no brand label.

418
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:10,290
Your clothing all looks expensive, but you always say they're cheap.

419
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,270
Did I get a stain on it?
- It's silk? 100%?

420
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:18,760
Ah, geez.
- Are you dating the Director jerk?

421
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,920
No matter how much you like money, you can't be doing that.

422
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,040
Why are you thinking like that?

423
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,630
It's strange.

424
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:28,430
You always say that you are saving money. When I actually look at your undergarments, it has no brand name, but it looks very expensive.

425
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,670
Are you sure you don't have a sponsor?

426
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:33,270
Are you saying that the Director is my sponsor?

427
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,660
If not, forget it.

428
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,680
It's not!

429
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,730
I'm upset. How hard must it be for the Deputy?

430
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:41,830
What do you mean?

431
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:47,410
Having a friend like him as a superior. How hard it must be working around him.

432
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:51,910
In fact, it does look like he has lost weight since the last time I saw him.

433
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:54,650
Do you like Deputy Choi that much?

434
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:58,420
Don't tell me to date him. Even if I do, it would turn out to be a tragedy.

435
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:01,960
How do you know? If I liked him that much, I would give it a try.

436
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,540
Do you need to try it to know whether it's feces or soybean paste?

437
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:09,100
I just like Deputy Manager just as students like their teacher.

438
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:14,860
You didn't hear Deputy Choi speak English, right? His pronunciation is amazing.

439
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,550
You're going to leave at later time?

440
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,920
Yeah. They're remodeling the market.

441
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,400
Deputy Choi will visit once for sure. I want to "coincidentally" meet him.

442
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:29,580
If I had that kind of adoration, I would ask him for a meal. You are actually quite shy, our Ji Yi.

443
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,400
I am shy.

444
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,560
My name is Lee Ji Yi.

445
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,590
Spelt backwards is still Lee Ji Yi.

446
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,670
My lover's name is Choi Joon Gi.

447
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:42,070
Spelt backwards is Gi Joon Choi. Gi Joon!

448
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,080
Excuse me, Deputy.

449
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,430
Did I not accept your greetings this time as well?

450
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:02,170
It's not like that. You hold grudges.

451
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:04,310
Goodbye.

452
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,690
Excuse me, Deputy.

453
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,840
Are you perhaps free in the evenings during the weekend?

454
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,450
If you have time, would you like to have dinner together?

455
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:21,450
Why?

456
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:24,170
What? Do you not have time?

457
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:25,990
I asked "Why?"

458
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:29,600
"Do you not have time?" was not the answer to the question.

459
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:35,560
I'm sorry. Goodbye.

460
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:39,220
What is it?
-What?
-What's your motive?

461
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:43,960
There must be a reason why you stopped me trice to ask me to eat dinner with you.

462
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,690
Do you like me?

463
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:52,790
It's not like that. I was just being nosy.

464
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:54,610
This is the first time I'm being nosy like this.

465
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:58,170
Everyone normally say "it's the first time" and it turns into a bad habit.

466
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,050
Actually,

467
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,630
if I say this, I could die.

468
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:16,320
Lee Ji Yi likes you.

469
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:20,520
I know.
- Oh...I see.

470
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,280
I knew you would know.

471
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:28,490
Is that why you're arranging a dinner for me and Lee Ji Yi?

472
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:31,810
Yes.
- Are you going to be there, too?

473
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,270
Yeah, sure.

474
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:38,310
Then what if I start liking you instead?

475
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,170
What?

476
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:44,050
How can you know between a man and a woman?

477
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:48,250
The most useless act of getting into someone's business is trying to make a relation between a man and a woman.

478
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:54,730
Then... I'm leaving.

479
00:31:56,310 --> 00:32:00,180
Oh, right. I'm not free this weekend.

480
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:10,370
He already has bricks stacked up on his shoulders.

481
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:13,280
But he stacked up more and more.

482
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:22,580
Why did you want to see me here?

483
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,730
There's a lot of stalkers lately. So popular.

484
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:28,820
Big sister? Or Father's workers?

485
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:33,180
Add plus-alphas. Normally that's my job.

486
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:37,270
In simpler terms, I'm enjoying focus and control.

487
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:41,300
Is this place safe?
- It's safe. Let's go for a walk.

488
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:47,850
Someone told me... not to meddle in other people's business.

489
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:50,410
Who said that?
-Why? Are you going to hit them?

490
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:53,320
Did Chang Soo complain to you? Is he doing something?

491
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,340
No. I'll take care of my business.

492
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,690
The most useless act of getting into someone's business is trying to make a relation between a man and a woman.

493
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,170
It's not wrong, but he didn't meet you with the mindset of just "a man and a woman."

494
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,800
It's a line connecting one asset to another.

495
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:08,500
If he did that to you, he did it to me also.

496
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,520
Why are you so good to me?

497
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:15,200
You weren't interested in me when we were young.

498
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,020
Well...

499
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,310
since I was the loner in our house, I was always ignored.

500
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:31,480
Because I aged.
-You become nice when you age?

501
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:36,510
It's because I aged, divorced, failed multiple business, and got betrayed by people.

502
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:42,430
It's not even my fault but I get the blame for other people's mess. Even if I say something,

503
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:45,730
they immediately say "what would you know being born with a golden spoon in your mouth?"

504
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,650
There's a lot you did as you aged.

505
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:51,440
Why do you live like this?

506
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:57,070
Still don't be good to me.

507
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,040
What's "being good" between a brother and a sister?

508
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:08,500
I'm not joking. It's like I've been jinxed.

509
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:13,260
The people who love me always disappear.

510
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:19,400
I'm trying really hard not to love you.

511
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,390
Then that means you love me. I'm too popular among girls, I can't help it.

512
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:32,620
I hope your era comes soon. You're probably not going to be like father.

513
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:36,850
I can't guarantee that. Father wasn't like that from the beginning.

514
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:40,610
He probably went through more than I did, and became who he is today.

515
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:43,860
I'm not confident. Staying like this.

516
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:47,650
You can do it because you're a good, warm person.

517
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:50,530
I heard that a warm person shouldn't do business,

518
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:53,010
but hit his wife's butt at home.

519
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,010
Don't believe that. I support you, Oppa.

520
00:34:56,010 --> 00:35:00,210
I don't have much power, but I'm going to give it all to you.

521
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:04,890
And this is a secret, but... I have a secret fund.

522
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:08,850
- I also bought our company's stocks.
- Really?
- Yep.

523
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:15,940
I haven't spent any of the money given to me by this family and have been investing it.

524
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:19,080
Around next year, it'll be the value that I want it to be.

525
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,170
Then I'm going to leave this house.

526
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:25,760
I'm proceeding without anyone knowing.

527
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:31,180
There's a friend I have from my part-time job at the market. I'm planning to start a company with her after leaving the Food Market.

528
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:35,180
I thought you just cosplaying as an ordinary person for you to survive.

529
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:39,540
I'm doing a part-time job to live, of course.

530
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:44,620
Because living as someone who I'm not lets me live as who I am.

531
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,650
But we're human.

532
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,030
We need to have an meaning in life, other than just living.

533
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:55,330
What?

534
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:59,740
It's been a while hearing words like "meaning," "dream," and "hope,"

535
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:03,370
so it's bothering me.
- Don't make fun of me.

536
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:08,540
Let's go inside and eat. I should have a meeting with this hope guy after we eat.

537
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,340
I'm hungry.

538
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,620
Why are you getting so worked up over the company all of a sudden?

539
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:17,660
Who's getting worked up?

540
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:20,210
Me wanting to go to the construction site is me being worked up?

541
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:22,360
You have something you didn't tell me.

542
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:26,070
What?
- Jang Yoon Ha...

543
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,970
How do you know that part-time worker?

544
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:31,670
I don't even want to talk about her.
- Aren't you going because you want to see her?

545
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:35,430
Why are you picking a fight when I just want to be productive for once?

546
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:38,460
I'm not going. You can go look around if you want.

547
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,270
Why aren't you going?
- I was going to, but...

548
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,560
I'm going to rest since you're going.

549
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,470
Stop riding your bicycle.

550
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:49,210
You think you can beat me if you practice?

551
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:34,480
Breaking News, Seoul District Public Prosecutor's Office is examining the areas of

552
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:37,250
Taejin Pharmaceuticals' subcontractor, Imsoo Chemicals Co.

553
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,650
and residence of all the people related to company.

554
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:43,040
As the investigation area widens for the prosecutors,

555
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:48,510
Taejin's President, Jang Won Shik, is being confirmed in being investigated by the prosecutors as well.

556
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:53,140
- Call Gyeong Joon.
- Yes, sir.

557
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:04,790
It's organic mung bean jelly. It's 100% organic, customer.

558
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,310
Oh my, what is this?

559
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:11,410
Did you season it like this to eat?

560
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,270
Can you sell things like this in this department store?

561
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,370
It taste fine.
- It taste fine?

562
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:26,540
Did you just say it tastes fine?

563
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:29,650
Are you my friend? Who said you can speak informally to me?

564
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:32,400
I'm sorry.
- It taste fine,

565
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:35,400
So are you saying I'm picking on you for no reason?
- No,

566
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,510
why would you be picking on me for no reason?

567
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:41,010
I'm saying that my taste in food is cheap, so I think everything is good.

568
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:45,660
For me, if I come to a place like this, I really like the department store's items

569
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,190
but hate the people selling it. So I don't buy.

570
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,150
I'm sorry.
- What are you sorry about?

571
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,700
Why does your face look like a Gisaeng?
(Giseng is Korean equivalent to Geisha)

572
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,130
You would fit in better at a bar.

573
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,780
Apologize.

574
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:05,170
Who are you?
- I work here.

575
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:07,700
Yoon Ha, stop.
- So?

576
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:10,460
You can evaluate all you want the items you buy

577
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,910
but you shouldn't evaluate a person selling the item.

578
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:16,650
Customer is the king.

579
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:19,210
You don't even know that, and you're a salesperson?

580
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:22,670
With your logic, I'm a king at a different store, too.

581
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:25,300
We're both kings, so what are you doing?

582
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:29,860
Apologize. How dare you tell her that her looks let her fit in a bar?

583
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,340
Your face isn't too appealing either.

584
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,970
Why, you. Hey!

585
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:58,260
- Date of birth.
- May 11th, 1989.

586
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,970
I'm a Taurus.

587
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:03,040
Who asked you about your zodiac sign?

588
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:06,040
That woman verbally abused us first.

589
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:09,000
Then sue her. Get me the diagnosis for psychological abuse.

590
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:15,470
I'm sorry.
- It's nothing.

591
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:20,280
- Excuse me.
- Yes
- I'm Yoomin Department Store Deputy Manager, Choi Joon Ki.

592
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:23,450
- But?
- This is our agreement.

593
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:26,090
She decided to withdraw the charge.

594
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:35,380
You two, follow me.

595
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:38,320
Where are we going?
- To apologize.

596
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,800
I don't want to.
- Let's just do it.

597
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,620
We can't.

598
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,530
Are you going to keep causing trouble?

599
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:47,360
I haven't been causing trouble.

600
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,730
If this is causing trouble, it's the first time.

601
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:52,330
Then why do I think that you've been causing trouble?

602
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:54,650
Probably because you have a prejudiced opinion about me.

603
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:58,450
If you want to remove my prejudiced opinions, let's go apologize.

604
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:01,430
I don't want to. I didn't do anything wrong.

605
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:06,300
Is that something to say about someone's face? We did not pick a fight with her first.

606
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,320
Then do you want to go to jail for physical abuse?

607
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:12,260
No. We'll apologize. Let's apologize, Yoon Ha

608
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:17,140
I heard that you can't sue someone again if charges have already been dropped. That woman can't sue us again.

609
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:20,640
That's when all the conditions for the settlement is met.

610
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,060
One of the conditions was for you to apologize.

611
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,260
I still won't do it.

612
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:36,250
Jang Yoon Ha,

613
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,400
you're fired.

614
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:46,060
The company... doesn't protect you anymore.

615
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,730
I'm a part-timer.

616
00:41:55,730 --> 00:42:00,780
The company has never protected me. Don't act like I was treated well this whole time.

617
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:04,510
Seeing you saying this and that about treatment you should be getting even though it's workplace, I get why you act like this.

618
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:08,520
If it's workplace, do I have to throw away my pride into the trash can?

619
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:12,260
Do you know what real pride is?

620
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:15,380
It's when you don't get hurt by others.

621
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:19,070
Jang Yoon Ha's pride is just for display.

622
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:22,630
Don't come out starting tomorrow. What are you going to do, Miss Lee Ji Yi?

623
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:24,690
Let's go do it together.

624
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:27,460
Is this like friends going to the bathroom hand-in-hand to you?

625
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:32,410
Do you think the other party won't know she actually doesn't feel sorry?

626
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:34,720
Ji Yi, go.

627
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:54,130
The group does not have corruptions. They're just trying to tie individual corruptions as the group's.

628
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:56,370
The fact that their trying to tie us together is important.

629
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:59,620
I'm working on it, so they're going to withdraw after a bit.

630
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:03,610
You'll look like you have responsibility if you enter the prosecution confidently.

631
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:07,250
We need to live a nonexistent life.

632
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:09,190
Only low classes drag others down.

633
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:13,520
The concepts of admitting to the hospital or using the wheelchair seems to be used up.

634
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,970
Are you teaching me?

635
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:17,360
I'm sorry.

636
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,890
Cover up Ye Won's affair, too.

637
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:22,980
No need to make things even noisier when there's already a big problem.

638
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,060
Why are you looking into that?

639
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:29,450
Is this also.... something you know about?

640
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:34,960
This matter, using this opportunity to clean up is for the company's image-

641
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:40,040
You... You are still taking the test.

642
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:42,930
Is there an end to the test?

643
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:46,070
That's what the low people say!

644
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:02,100
Did you think I was going to be happy seeing you,

645
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,250
and satisfied, over something like this?

646
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:07,060
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

647
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:17,100
Where's your house?

648
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,720
You can just drop me off at the department store.

649
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,490
Okay then.

650
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:26,830
Deputy manager, since I apologized,

651
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,830
can you cancel Yoon Ha's dismissal?

652
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:29,920
No, I can't do that.

653
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,270
She's a good person. She doesn't talk about her complicated situations, so I don't know much about that.

654
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:36,770
How do you know she's a good person when you don't know her that well?

655
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:40,120
But... I understand that.

656
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:44,770
When you have a lot to hide, that means you carry a lot of sadness.

657
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:48,740
If she has a lot to hide, that means she's a dubious person.

658
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:54,830
My parents divorced when I was in middle school.

659
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:58,450
My parents married different spouses, so I don't have anywhere to go.

660
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:02,790
I was able to say that since 5 years ago.

661
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:07,180
I'm saying this because I really worry about you.

662
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:10,540
People who are bad to Yoon Ha all get hurt.

663
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:16,470
I've said this a couple of times, but those people always got fired or go bankrupt.

664
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:22,140
Miss Lee Ji Yi, worrying about others is the most useless thing to do.

665
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:23,760
Worry about yourself.

666
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,740
Are you really going to fire Yoon Ha?

667
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:29,730
I already did. We're here.

668
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:41,790
So Jin (Food Market)

669
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:44,470
The picture isn't big because I took it from far away.

670
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:48,170
Why do you need this picture? Are you going to sue her?

671
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:54,480
Oppa, please take care of it this time too.

672
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,600
Huh? What is this?

673
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,270
I'll be leaving then.

674
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,820
Okay.

675
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,180
Is she giving me the cold shoulder?

676
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:22,790
Does she bother you?

677
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:23,970
No.

678
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:27,990
You came all the way to see the department's reconstruction. The sun will rise in the west...

679
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:30,190
I'm going to find Hyung's weakness.

680
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:33,520
I think he's too relaxed because I only showed him me goofing around.

681
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,530
Good job.

682
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:37,820
How much do you think he looks down upon me to do that during the meeting?

683
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:39,040
You hold grudges, too.

684
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,170
I suffered it once. I'm not going through that again.

685
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:44,850
How do you know Jang Yoon Ha?

686
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,100
Don't you know?

687
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,950
Do I know her?

688
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:54,230
Nevermind. It got boring.

689
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:57,060
Let's do better, Joon Ki.

690
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:16,560
Miss Lee Ji Yi.

691
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:21,250
She's ignoring me again.

692
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:22,970
Hey!

693
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:47,860
Miss Lee Ji Yi, is there something wrong?

694
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:52,930
Do I look like a Gisaeng?
(Gisaeng: Korean equivalent to Geisha)

695
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:06,650
Cheers!

696
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:11,560
One shot.

697
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,890
What do you mean you look like a gisaeng?

698
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:26,960
Who says that nowadays? They say barmaid.

699
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,930
That isn't making me feel better.

700
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:33,730
Of course... You can only comfort others if you have been comforted.

701
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:36,430
You never got insulted so far, right?

702
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:39,690
Am I not a human? Am I locked up in a tower by myself?

703
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:43,460
How can I not get insulted before when I'm living around people?

704
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:47,420
I'm getting angry.

705
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:49,770
You came here to comfort me.

706
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:51,590
I want a drink too because I'm getting upset.

707
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:53,650
I have a bar I usually go to. Let's go there.

708
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:56,240
I don't like these seats here because they're uncomfortable.

709
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:08,110
Then, goodbye.

710
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:14,280
I said let's go somewhere to drink. How can you just leave like that?

711
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:19,220
Why did you deceive me when you first met me?

712
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:22,920
Because you thought I was going to try to cling onto you if you said you're the Director?

713
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,040
No, it's not that...

714
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:30,550
It was a joke. I thought you were going to feel uncomfortable if I told you.

715
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:34,770
You're not that bad of a person. You know how to tell white lies.

716
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:38,150
It's not that, I'm serious.
- You must be happy since you're rich.

717
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:42,890
To the point where a food cart seat is uncomfortable.
How have you been living so far?

718
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:46,750
You're not just some Director. You're the President's son.

719
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:50,410
You're lucky! Is it okay if I touch you?

720
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:52,820
Hey, what's wrong with you?

721
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:56,890
I never met a Chaebol before. I don't want to wash my hands before I go to sleep.

722
00:49:56,890 --> 00:50:00,040
I'm going to tell my children later.

723
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:03,010
"I met a Chaebol before!"

724
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:08,980
Let's go. You're drunk. I'll take you home.

725
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:13,440
Wow, you held my hand! I touched it!

726
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,420
Eureka!

727
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:18,430
Who the heck are you?

728
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:22,730
Yeah, what's there in life? Just live it.

729
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:25,130
I can't just die.

730
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:29,640
I have to pay my monthly rent and save up deposit.

731
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:33,560
It's my mom's birthday soon, so I have to buy her a gift.

732
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,980
I have so many things to do.

733
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:39,540
Let's go.

734
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:41,810
What?

735
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:43,980
You said you're taking me home.

736
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:47,440
If I hold up my ego and not go in your car, it's only my loss.

737
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,880
I save money, and time. I think it's convenient and nice.

738
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,550
Never mind. I don't want to take you back anymore because you're like this.

739
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:58,940
Are you seriously trying to hit on me?
- Even if I wanted to, I can't. It's unrealistic.

740
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:01,580
You're just a Chaebol I see in dramas.

741
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:05,890
I don't want to shoot a drama, and I don't have time to shoot one.

742
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:09,610
I'm too busy living my life.

743
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:15,190
You said you want me to take you back.
- You said you didn't want to!

744
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:18,970
Are you joking around with me?

745
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:25,340
You're fortunate.

746
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:28,830
The family is crazy right now because of the news about our companies.

747
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:33,530
The people that usually give the medicine are probably the ones going around busily so that they can give the medicine again.

748
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:38,150
What are you complaining about? All you do is eat and fool around.

749
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:40,170
Eating and fooling around is better.

750
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:43,310
It's better than being someone who lacks in skill

751
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:46,640
and being a nuisance to those below them.

752
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:50,960
I would die rather than live like you do.

753
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,530
I'm asking because I'm really curious.

754
00:51:54,530 --> 00:51:56,950
Why do you hate me so much?

755
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:59,090
You're detestable.

756
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:03,330
You seem like a person resting under shade during gym class because you're tired.

757
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:05,390
Me?

758
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:10,010
Mom and dad don't care about you. You live life however you feel like.

759
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:14,440
I want to fool around like you do. I don't want to go to work.

760
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:20,380
Do you know what it is to not receive love from your parents?

761
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:26,870
That's why you stuck onto our older brother. So that you can take advantage when father passes away.

762
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:36,200
Forget it. What would I say with a person who has an intelligence of a 7 year old.

763
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,320
Who do you think you are?

764
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:42,510
If I'm 7, you're a toddler.

765
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:47,990
Let me go.

766
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:56,730
If I were you, I would've gotten a decent amount of money and live however I want to.
Why do you live here?

767
00:52:56,730 --> 00:53:01,390
You leave. Get money and fool around.

768
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:04,790
As you sponsor your favorite models.
What?

769
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:08,330
Do you want to hang out with people who are only after your money?

770
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:09,980
You.

771
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:12,940
Let go.

772
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:19,460
I'm not going to leave if I'm not perfectly prepared.

773
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:24,030
When I get prepared, I'll leave even if you tell me not to.

774
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:28,630
So, don't get on my nerves while I'm here.

775
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:30,550
You're so cowardly.

776
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:34,460
Gain some strength. There's no such thing as "perfect preparation."

777
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:39,020
You do it even if you lack a bit. You can do it.

778
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:42,720
You always can't finish anything.

779
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:08,050
- Why'd you come?
-I made you tired for no reason.

780
00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:12,180
No, it's fine. Who knew something was going to happen today?

781
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:15,340
Is it that big that I need to worry?
- Don't ask.

782
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:18,580
So I have to worry about it.

783
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:26,100
Forget the favor I asked earlier. I got fired from my part-time job anyway.

784
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:28,730
Is there something wrong again?

785
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:30,500
No.

786
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,770
Still, it's nice that you came here to greet me.

787
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:37,300
It's been a long time, shall we have a date?

788
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:42,610
At times like these, you must not lose your mind.

789
00:54:42,610 --> 00:54:47,000
Think of this all as a business management lesson.

790
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,190
I got it.

791
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:21,040
Hey, wake up.

792
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,870
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

793
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:31,080
Don't you think you're a little bit too much? How could you sleep like that in front of me?

794
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,330
Are we there yet?

795
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:36,940
We're here.
- Thank you.

796
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,510
Why can't you do it?

797
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:50,370
This is a trick, isn't it? So that you can touch me.

798
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:55,370
What is he saying? Half of a bottle is my drinking capacity, you know.

799
00:55:55,370 --> 00:55:57,700
But...

800
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:01,470
I drank one more bottle.

801
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:05,440
Why are you crying?

802
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,130
I cry when I'm drunk.

803
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:11,090
You didn't cry earlier.

804
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:20,780
It worked.

805
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:26,140
My drunk habits emerge later... Not right after drinking.

806
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,320
Wow, now she's laughing? What's this, crying and then laughing.

807
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:34,440
- This girl is so...
- This girl is so pretty, right? I'm so pretty. Me.

808
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:38,450
Yoon Ha's dad worked at your house, right?

809
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:42,130
As a driver? Or as gardener?

810
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:43,990
This and that.

811
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:46,860
You don't even know what her background is, and you're her friend.

812
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:49,270
Did you tell her I'm a high school graduate?

813
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:52,110
You're a high school graduate?
- Yes.

814
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:55,080
But these days it's more special being a high school graduate rather than a college graduate!

815
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,600
Everyone can go to college.

816
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:01,210
But you know, Suzy and IU are also high school graduates.

817
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:04,340
Do you know what we have in common?

818
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:06,790
We're pretty.

819
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,820
Hey, you're becoming scary.

820
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:19,800
I understand Yoon Ha.

821
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:24,970
To be honest, telling people I'm a high school graduate

822
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:29,600
It's only been 2 years...

823
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:35,690
I got it. I get it now so get off.

824
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:48,850
Hey, what did you do to her? Why aren't you getting out?

825
00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:51,540
Oh my gosh, the two of you are acting out together.

826
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:55,930
I'm not the one who did anything. She's been doing things to me.

827
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,790
Ji Yi, are you alright?

828
00:57:57,790 --> 00:58:00,280
Yoon Ha~

829
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:03,840
What should I do here? Get out from that side, from that side.

830
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:07,570
I'm sorry for going to apologize alone.

831
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:09,720
I'm sorry for making you go alone.

832
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:14,570
What are you guys doing? Get rid of that rock.

833
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:21,940
In the next life, let's be born as the Chaebol's youngest daughters.

834
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:25,580
Are you okay? Come here.

835
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:38,220
Daebak.
