1
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,640
Stop it. She said she doesn't want to.

2
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,340
Let go!

3
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,920
Let's talk.

4
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,300
We broke up. Why do we need to talk now?

5
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,940
Then... can you talk with me?

6
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,640
I can.

7
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,680
Why are you two doing this?
- Doing what?

8
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,620
Why are your edges so sharp? You guys aren't acting like yourselves.

9
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,800
Do you think we always just like each other and get along?

10
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,880
You come. too, Chang Soo.

11
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:35,800
What? Why?

12
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:40,440
When I said "let's go," she got mad.

13
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,860
You must be there.

14
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,100
Then you also need to come along.

15
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:46,980
Why me?

16
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,200
When I said "let's go," you got mad at me.

17
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,220
So you have to be there.

18
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,080
Alright. Where do you want to go and talk?

19
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,660
When did I agree to this?

20
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,120
High Society 
Episode 13

21
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,180
Put in some soju as well.

22
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,000
Lee Ji Yi already drank soju.

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,160
Don't take it out then. Just buy the ones that we are going to drink.

24
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,700
Aigoo. Even if I look, I don't know what to get.

25
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,480
I'm going to leave. You pick whatever and come out.

26
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,840
Hey!

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,800
You do it. Do you not have hands and feet? It's just natural for you to order people around.

28
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,480
Hey!

29
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,000
Just buy any side dish that we can eat while drinking and come out.

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,120
Is that so hard? You just have to know Hangul.

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,240
That guy, seriously!

32
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,580
It's cramping my style! Can't you carry this?

33
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,340
You said I was childish.

34
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,300
Do you think this kind of behavior is mature?

35
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,880
How is it after moving companies? Is it better now that you don't have me?

36
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,540
It's all the same for salaried men.

37
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,580
It's good because I'm less emotionally worn than when I was with you.

38
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,460
Emotionally worn?

39
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,640
Were you emotionally worn from me?

40
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,080
I had to make you feel better.

41
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,440
Your competitive spirit was strong. So, you always had to win.

42
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,100
You also have an innocent and warm side, so I couldn't hate you.

43
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,300
It was quite complicated.

44
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,460
Did you always talk this much?

45
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,980
I'm matching your style. You asked me to, remember?

46
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,660
Don't.

47
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,440
Let go of Lee Ji Yi. You broke up, so why are you holding on to her?

48
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,240
If I let her go, are you going to date her or something?

49
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,040
When I look at the way you act, I feel an obligation to date her.

50
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,000
Hey!
- Why? Does it make you go crazy?

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,740
This is the first time that I've seen a girl that you like this much.

52
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:03,340
At first, I thought it was just out of curiosity, but your mother got involved.

53
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,080
What did you say to me?

54
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,920
You said that you could change things once you decide!

55
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,560
Do you have to right to ask me that?

56
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,260
You used a sincere woman's heart

57
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:16,120
and tried to ascend your status through marriage.

58
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,260
I didn't know she was that sincere. If I had known, I wouldn't have done it.

59
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,580
You even did that to me. Am I not an innocent person?

60
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:32,500
You said that you can't accept me, but you can accept Yoon Ha?

61
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,660
She's different from you. I thought she was someone like you,

62
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,580
but she's different.

63
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,820
Even if I try not to

64
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,300
when I look at you, I waver.

65
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,880
I want to hit you with my fist.

66
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,680
Should I hit you first? You hit me first last time.

67
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,380
What are you both doing?

68
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,080
I sent you both to buy drinks, but you are fighting again?

69
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,560
Do you always fight whenever you meet?

70
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,400
He keeps making sarcastic comments.

71
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,240
Deputy Choi wouldn't do that. You probably teased him.

72
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,000
It's probably because you don't know him that well, but Deputy Choi makes those remarks a lot.

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,860
When he's wrong, he won't admit it. He also acts like he's too good for everything.

74
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,100
I really like you.

75
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,700
Acting high and mighty is better than being selfish.

76
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,700
He's so selfish that he can't stand to have a hard time. He doesn't even ask things that he knows he is disadvantageous in.

77
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,100
So did you do something great by drinking with Joon Gi all night long?

78
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,420
We broke up! What does it matter to you who I drink with?

79
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,220
You used to like Joon Gi.

80
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,100
You sure remember that well!

81
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,740
Don't you remember how I brought you chicory because I liked you?

82
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:39,080
A little while ago, you were all like "Let's go too" and held on to him.

83
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,360
Why do you give your heart out to everyone?

84
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,680
For a person who left with Yoon Ha, you have a lot of things to say.

85
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,480
You must be so happy that there is nobody else to stop you two, since you guys are at the same status.

86
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,000
Hey!

87
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,060
Hello?

88
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,980
Father did? He's at our place, right?

89
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,200
Alright. I will go there.

90
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,180
Where are you going?

91
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,000
I will walk you to your car.

92
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I don't have my car. I sent it ahead. I'm going to ride a taxi.

93
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,500
Then, I'll walk you to the taxi.

94
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,100
Again, what? Are you trying to use your skills on me?

95
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:22,920
What are you talking about?

96
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,580
It was calculated, right? Bringing me the potato dish, calling me a taxi.

97
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,980
You did those things to win my heart, no?

98
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,680
You're right.

99
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,580
You repent so quickly. Since when were you so honest?

100
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,040
What kind of trick are you using now?

101
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,520
I'm just being nice. It's not a trick.

102
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,580
You fell for me so quickly because you wanted to.

103
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:49,680
You're right to the end. You're not wrong of your own accord but I'm wrong, too.

104
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,940
Get in.

105
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,620
The taxi didn't do anything wrong.

106
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,060
Why are you getting in?

107
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,380
I'll go with you.

108
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,020
Please get out. Get out!

109
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,240
Go to Ahtae hospital, please.

110
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,200
You're not getting out?

111
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,160
What kind of trick is this?

112
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,440
Just stop.

113
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:39,380
Why stop now? When I said we should date, you were all about social mores;

114
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,020
that was a trick too, huh?

115
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:42,880
It was calculated.

116
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,020
Why is everything you say so blunt? You can't lie?

117
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,560
You said you don't like lying.

118
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,720
Exactly.

119
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,960
From when and what was calculated

120
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,940
and since when and what was sincere?

121
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,880
I don't know that either. It's all mixed together

122
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,500
so it's hard for me to differentiate it as well.

123
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,720
Ahjussi, please stop the car.

124
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,900
I can't go with this guy anymore!

125
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,280
I can't go anymore either because it's so loud.

126
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,980
Why are you having a lovers' quarrel in someone else's workplace?

127
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:21,640
It's upsetting if you speak like that. How is this a lovers' quarrel?

128
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,120
You can't tell that I genuinely dislike this?

129
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,320
You should just lose at a certain point.

130
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,140
The guy is holding on to you so tightly because he likes you.

131
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,180
Ahjussi!

132
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,400
My apologies.

133
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,840
Don't touch me.

134
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,120
Ahjussi, let's go.

135
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,040
No, no, no! It's fine.

136
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,380
Give me some water.
- Okay.

137
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,200
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

138
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,380
Two of your arteries have become seriously narrow and

139
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,560
you had a heart attack;

140
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,820
it's not too serious. You had surgery so you'll have to stay in the hospital for 2-3 days

141
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,500
and rest at home for a month, the doctors said.

142
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:36,600
I was really surprised.
- I was really surprised, too.

143
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:41,170
Never once did I think about the fact that you can faint.

144
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,340
You had your regular checkup.

145
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:48,030
but I guess disease is fate as well.

146
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,560
What are you doing here?
- I came to check if you were getting back safely.

147
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,280
Now, what kind of situation is this?

148
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,300
I was innocently worried about you.

149
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,770
Don't even speak of the word "innocent." Do you even know what that means?

150
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,680
I know what that means. Don't make me seem so despicable.

151
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,660
The actions that you showed to me were despicable.

152
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,930
You still don't know what your mistake is.

153
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:28,140
I know... plenty.

154
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,960
I like you.

155
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,640
Your heart suddenly went "thump," right?

156
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:04,970
It's just a joke. How does it feel? You continually acted this way to me.

157
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,880
You are coming now?
- Oh, how is he?
- He's okay.

158
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,120
He's going to get one or two more days of rest and be discharged.
- Okay.

159
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,400
Besides these documents, I also have a USB.

160
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,320
I kept thinking about it.

161
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,770
I think this has something to do with the fight between you and brother.

162
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:42,990
I also think this has something to do with brother's death.

163
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,890
Isn't that person, Choi Joon Gi?

164
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,810
It seems as if they are making a visitation together.
- You said they broke up.

165
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:01,240
It's hard to break up once and for all after dating.
- Why is it hard to break up once and for all?

166
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,940
I really hate people who drag out their feelings.

167
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:08,180
Tell Choi Joon Gi to come to my office tomorrow morning.
- Yes.

168
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:18,110
From exactly what point to what point was it your skill,

169
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,960
and what point to what point was it sincere?

170
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:46,030
If you loved me then, then you should be loving me now.

171
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:50,860
Even if I made a mistake, even if it doesn't make sense in your head,

172
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:55,500
you should be able to accept it in your heart. That's love.

173
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:02,770
♫ Please stop coming close to me ♫

174
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:10,450
♫ Because your warmth will surely shake me up ♫

175
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:18,240
♫ As much as I am holding back from you ♫

176
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:24,720
♫ It may hurt but I have to hold back  ♫

177
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,090
♫  from you  ♫

178
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:33,040
You're late.
- Yes.
- Come here for a moment. Let's talk.

179
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,990
I met Lee Ji Yi.

180
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,910
Good.
- She's really funny. How can there be someone like her?

181
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,670
That's how it all starts.

182
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,780
When I first saw her, I wondered how there could be someone like her.

183
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,380
Anyways, let's meet Si On again.

184
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:02,310
She really likes you. After the marriage meeting, it seems like she likes you even more.

185
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,270
But is it great if I get married to her family?

186
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:08,260
Even so, how can you say "her family"? You are getting married to Si On.

187
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,810
Mom, do we have to consider their backgrounds?

188
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:15,210
Yes, I will never concede that point.

189
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:19,370
The moment you choose Lee Ji Yi, the kind of events that will occur,

190
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,220
do you want me to explain it to you again?

191
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:28,120
I have 3 children. You are one of them. You are our most beloved son.

192
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,100
Okay, do whatever you want.

193
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:41,560
I chose you, remember that.

194
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,070
Why do you have to say it so resolutely? Making me nervous.

195
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:54,200
I'm going to tell Si On to call you. Accept her well.

196
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,040
The reason I'm not asking you

197
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:39,140
is because I can't solve the issue even if I know about it.
- I know that it can't be solved.

198
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,160
In order for it to be solved, either I have to be born again or

199
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,970
you need to be born again.

200
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:49,250
It's not to that extent.
- If it's not to that extent, then what is it?

201
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:54,140
Is it that great... the thing you want to protect?

202
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,110
I have never lived outside of this neighborhood.

203
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:04,770
I have moved around many times.

204
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,410
At first, it seemed like I couldn't live like this;

205
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:14,760
but if you live, it's bearable. I'm not trying to criticize you.

206
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:20,860
So, live in that neighborhood. Live well.
- I don't think I can live well...

207
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,040
without you.

208
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:32,140
I am going to live well.

209
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,870
I'm going to live well like I have been.

210
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:38,580
And if I do that, I'm going to forget about it. And if I forget, I'm going to get married.

211
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:41,480
Meeting a man who has a similar background as me.

212
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,790
Being loved by my in-laws. I'm going to tell my child when I get one.

213
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,860
A long time ago,

214
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,700
some handsome chaebol

215
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,380
really liked me.

216
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,150
Please don't look for me again.

217
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:09,220
I miss you, but what should I do if you keep looking for me?

218
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,500
I miss you so much...!

219
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,470
But what should I do if you keep appearing in front of my eyes?!

220
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:37,380
♫  From the beginning, why my heart  ♫

221
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:42,530
♫  If you were going to hurt me, why did you come?  ♫

222
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:47,890
♫  Can you not come again?  ♫

223
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:51,590
Can we only kiss once a day?

224
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,940
Are you asking me to do it in that way?
- Yes.

225
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,190
Are you the person who said that she didn't want to date?

226
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:03,770
I am. If you don't want to, forget it.

227
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:20,440
I am going to do whatever you ask of me. What else do you want me to do?

228
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,610
How can I...

229
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,910
forget you?

230
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:59,120
Hello.
- Deputy...

231
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,150
I need someone to talk to,

232
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:08,680
but Yoon Ha is in the hospital.

233
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:17,460
I'm not going to tell you words of false hope.

234
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,820
I also don't like those words.

235
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,490
I'm so lonely

236
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:29,190
and have no one to talk to.

237
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:33,480
♫  What should I do? What should I do?  ♫

238
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,590
I wish I could be reborn.

239
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:43,950
♫  Is this all that we amount to?  ♫

240
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:53,050
♫  Something must have gone wrong from the beginning  ♫

241
00:20:53,050 --> 00:21:00,280
♫  How can love be like this?  ♫

242
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:06,130
♫  Every day without you is so difficult  ♫

243
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:16,350
♫  All day long, my heart hurts so much I feel like dying  ♫

244
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,690
Are you just coming now?

245
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,730
Yes. Is he sleeping?

246
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:26,350
Yeah.

247
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,790
I heard it's not serious.

248
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:45,220
Yeah. Doesn't your father seem like a human now?

249
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,980
I've never thought he wasn't human.

250
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,120
You're so interesting.

251
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,410
All the other children were so careful because they were scared of your father.

252
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,190
But you have no fear.

253
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:59,280
Father was never bad towards me.

254
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,740
He was different from you.

255
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,280
Then am I scary to you?

256
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,840
Not scary

257
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,880
but I did feel bad for you sometimes.

258
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,630
Why?

259
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:18,870
Because father isn't good to you.

260
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:21,070
But you have to live with it.

261
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,520
Are you going to sleep here?

262
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,020
Yeah.

263
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:35,580
As you live, not all men are the same.

264
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,090
I'll look for a good match for you.

265
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,770
You're trusting me with your marriage now, right?

266
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:43,790
You tried your way and it didn't work out.

267
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:48,980
Okay, but why are you worrying about me now?

268
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:53,150
You probably think that I unfairly took my anger out on you,

269
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,860
but it was all for you.

270
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,970
Please don't doubt my sincerity in that.

271
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:01,540
The method may not have always been correct.

272
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:04,690
If thinking that way makes you sleep a little easier at night

273
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:08,220
then think that way. I'll be leaving now.

274
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:23,710
Did you go see father in the hospital?

275
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:26,120
Yeah. Are you going out?

276
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,670
My mood was terrible so I made plans to try to turn it around.

277
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:36,660
I was so shocked. I didn't know father was someone who could collapse.

278
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:41,580
I know, right? He takes such good care of his health, I thought he'd never fall ill.

279
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,660
Did you see Yoon Ha?

280
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,040
She was coming in as I was leaving.

281
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,590
But where does she store her valuables?

282
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:55,040
In her safe. But her safe is in her closet. She doesn't know how to securely store her valuables.

283
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,960
Where is yours?

284
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:59,990
I need to make one.

285
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:02,820
Even if you had a safe, you wouldn't tell me anyway.

286
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:06,180
I'm tired. I need to rest.

287
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:09,030
Okay, rest. I'm leaving now.

288
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:49,040
Can you send someone over to the house?

289
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:53,020
I need to replace a safe. I'll read you the model number. Bring me the same one.

290
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:02,420
Give me the USB. Put that in the newly bought safe and put it in the same place.

291
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,050
Okay.

292
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:47,990
I heard the entrance to Bloomingdale's is going well.

293
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,890
When do you think the decision will be finalized?

294
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:51,780
Within the week.

295
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,830
Can you look into this?

296
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:58,070
This is the proposal from Yoo Min Department Store about the joint construction project in Jeju.

297
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:00,050
Okay.

298
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:02,890
If you need anything, let me know.

299
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,140
Thank you.

300
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,880
I cherish people.

301
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:11,090
Because it's the people who are doing the work.

302
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:14,210
I have a sense of responsibility towards my people.

303
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,480
We're seeing each other often.

304
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,830
We are.

305
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:33,120
I thought about it, and I did bare my soul.

306
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,600
I fell into my own emotions and didn't think about any of the consequences

307
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,050
and packaged it nicely as fate.

308
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:43,150
I wanted to fall in love and you were in front of me.

309
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,700
I think that life is a choice.

310
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:54,090
But... it seems love isn't a choice.

311
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:59,110
The first day I saw you, I coincidentally saw you 3 times.

312
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:02,770
Twice at the hotel, once in front of work.

313
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:08,090
This is what I thought then: They say that if you meet three times coincidentally, it's fate.

314
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:10,500
But I don't believe in fate.

315
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:15,950
I regret that I didn't make a choice because I believed in fate.

316
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:19,450
I regret that

317
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:22,040
I made a choice and didn't believe in fate.

318
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:28,640
Why did you come to our company? Under Ye Won of all people.

319
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,930
Did you not think of me?

320
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:33,290
You didn't think that things would get complicated for me?

321
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:38,080
Do you know how much of a laughing stock I became to my family?

322
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,980
I can't answer that right now.

323
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,690
Why?

324
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,220
I can't tell you right now.

325
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,580
More than things getting complicated for me,

326
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,240
getting by is more important to you. That's why.

327
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:56,540
That look that I saw in your eyes from time to time,

328
00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:00,140
I thought it was you falling for me because I was so mysterious.

329
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:05,280
But in reality, you were thinking, "why is she going so overboard," huh?

330
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:11,670
In the end, our story is about deception.

331
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:14,760
If you can make it so I can't grab a foothold in this place,

332
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,510
can you do it?

333
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:20,410
Be strong. Jang Yoon Ha.

334
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:40,160
Tell me what you want.

335
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,510
I can't ask you for tea between sisters?

336
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,910
You saw Choi Joon Gi on your way in, right?

337
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:50,640
I did.
- It bothered you, right?

338
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,220
To be with a man you broke up with.

339
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:56,720
He's not with me so don't worry about it.

340
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,810
You told me, an eye or an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

341
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,860
But why are you leaving him alone?

342
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,390
Didn't he approach you after looking at your background?

343
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:06,950
No. His ex-girlfriend

344
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:09,040
is spreading rumors about him.

345
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,390
Then you are dating again?

346
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:14,350
No. It's over.

347
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,610
Okay, you can leave now.

348
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:24,610
I called you because father is sick and I've been feeling out of it.

349
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:29,170
I haven't seen you laugh very much.

350
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:33,120
Life is too complicated to live in laughter.

351
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,160
I've always had to prove myself to win

352
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,610
and Gyeong Joon always won just because he was Gyeong Joon.

353
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:44,600
Why do you always have to win? You just have to protect yourself.

354
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,190
That's why you're still a child.

355
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:50,290
Business can always change.

356
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:52,610
If you have no power, it's taken from you.

357
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:58,900
That USB, are you storing it well?

358
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,310
Don't worry. I am.

359
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:07,220
I'm so curious as to what you're going to do with it.

360
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,540
So reveal your hand quickly.

361
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,160
Okay.

362
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:24,110
How are the two of them?

363
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:26,040
I think they're still carrying on.

364
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,800
That's what it seemed like yesterday.

365
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,190
But why is she being like that?

366
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:34,420
It's only fun when your counterpart is at a certain level.

367
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,740
The fact that I'm making her my rival makes me pathetic.

368
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,920
It doesn't even seem like she knows the USB is missing.

369
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,620
That's why the President likes her more.

370
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,580
Father? Yoon Ha?

371
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,290
Last time, she was upset because it seemed like things weren't going well at work,

372
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:48,640
the President told her to not be reserved in asking for things.

373
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,500
Father is getting old.

374
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,720
He's getting weirder and weirder.

375
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,830
Well, Father wields the sword.

376
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,240
But she is his daughter so she must have something.

377
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,100
She had something on Gyeong Joon, too. That's why he gave her those stocks.

378
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:09,220
As of now, her weakness is Choi Joon Gi.

379
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,620
Weaknesses become weaknesses when you exploit them and the person falls.

380
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:16,680
With her, you have to shake up her emotions.

381
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,640
Get ready. I'm going to go see father.

382
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,940
Yeah, Si On.

383
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,300
What are you doing, Oppa?

384
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,440
What do you think? I'm working.

385
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,800
I heard you asked for me to call you.

386
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,540
I'm calling you first because it's you, Oppa.

387
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:46,640
I'm not the kind of girl who calls people first.

388
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:51,500
I got it. Thank you so much for calling me first.

389
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,700
I have to go now.

390
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,200
What about lunch?

391
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,880
I have plans.

392
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,500
Surprise!

393
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,620
If you do any more surprises, you might end up in the hospital.

394
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:13,400
Your mom said you like things from the heart more than money.

395
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,000
So I brought you hand made chocolates.

396
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:22,340
Chocolate in this heat?

397
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,540
You can't eat chocolate when it's hot out?

398
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,840
No, not necessarily...

399
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,360
There is the heart that went into making it. You have to say thank you at least.

400
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,000
I got it. Leave.

401
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,180
What is it with the "I got it. Leave"?

402
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:42,000
If you say I got it, then you're acknowledging the fact that I put my heart into making the chocolates.

403
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,100
If you're acknowledging it, then you should compliment me. What do you mean get out?

404
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,860
You're kind of tiring. And you like arguing.

405
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:56,380
Yeah. I like arguing a lot.

406
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:00,100
Oppa, if you ever get in a fight, tell me.

407
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,500
No matter where I go, I never lose with words.

408
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,780
What did you major in?

409
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,120
Math.

410
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,260
If you studied math, why do you talk so much?

411
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:10,400
You're interested in the connection between talking and math?

412
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,540
No, I don't want to know at all.

413
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,480
Si On
- Mmmm?

414
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,620
Get out.

415
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,200
Oppa...

416
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,180
You know that cafe we met in last time?

417
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:24,640
If you go wait there, I'll meet you.

418
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,640
That's what you meant by get out?

419
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,840
Go wait at the cafe? I got you.

420
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,640
This chindere...

421
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,200
What the heck is that.

422
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,400
Chindere is...
- I got it.

423
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,460
Leave.

424
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:45,540
You asking me to wait at the cafe by telling me to get out...

425
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:48,920
is really sexy.

426
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,680
Oppa, you're so charming.

427
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,520
I'll be leaving now.

428
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,680
Mom.

429
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:18,360
Marriage or whatever... Just you put Si On in front of me again.

430
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,560
Why?

431
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,120
She's freaking weird.

432
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:26,280
She makes me go crazy a million times in 10 minutes.

433
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,240
Okay.

434
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,880
She said she'll wait at the cafe we met in before. You go instead.

435
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,300
Why me?

436
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,600
Because you created this mess.

437
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:39,740
You setting me up with other girls is your prerogative but I don't like her.

438
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:44,880
Don't forget... I chose you.

439
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,160
It looks like marrying him off is going to be difficult.

440
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:54,400
Even if he is married, is he going to create scandals his whole life?

441
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:02,640
They said the results were good and you can be discharged tomorrow.

442
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,720
Oh, you came?

443
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,800
I have something to report so I came. Father, you look good.

444
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,640
He's okay.

445
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:17,840
Yoo Min Department store wants to co-construct a mall in Jeju. Please look over it.

446
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,500
You already brought work?

447
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,440
He'll recover faster if he works.

448
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:27,760
I wanted to make something in Jeju. I'll look over this.

449
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,080
Mom... About Yoon Ha.

450
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:31,700
What?

451
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:35,560
What if we married her off to Chang Soo of Yoo Min department store?

452
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,960
Is there something that she could be with in that family?

453
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,880
She had a date with Chang Soo a while back but it didn't work out.

454
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,680
There was miscommunication then but it's all resolved now.

455
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:50,940
After this scandal, won't it be difficult to marry her off to some households?

456
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,360
Chang Soo is okay?

457
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,080
I think they're close.

458
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:59,200
Chang Soo came to see me a little bit ago and he said he would see Yoon Ha before he left.

459
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,140
Oh really?

460
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,600
Then why don't you set it up.

461
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:06,100
Before there's any more scandals with weirdos.

462
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,180
Okay.

463
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,040
How is the President?

464
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:17,040
I heard that the worst is over.

465
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,600
What was he sick with?

466
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,960
I'm sorry but I have to make the food to take to the hospital.

467
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,620
I'll call you later.

468
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:27,560
Chief Kim, Chief Kim...

469
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,920
I'm so curious I could die.

470
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:42,880
The person you have called is not available...

471
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:47,620
Secretary Song, you're really going to be like this?

472
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,000
This won't do.

473
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:11,520
Work hard. Eat with this.

474
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,300
No.

475
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:17,140
Then... is there family inside?

476
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,180
No.

477
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:22,540
Then... I'll go in for a bit.

478
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,340
No.

479
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:28,000
If there's no family inside, why can't I? I'll just see him for a bit and come out.

480
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,600
I said you can't.

481
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,080
Ugh, really?

482
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,420
Hyungnim!

483
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:39,880
Is he okay? It's nothing serious?

484
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,480
If you tell me just that, I'll leave.

485
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,380
Is there anywhere to talk here?

486
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,180
Let's go.

487
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,400
How old are you?

488
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,140
You're over 40, right?

489
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:13,120
You're not 50 yet so it's not too late for you to start over.

490
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,540
End it now.

491
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:21,000
That... I'll figure out with the President.

492
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,640
Jang Won Sik is mine.

493
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:27,540
That man is mine. If he dies or lives, it'll be next to me.

494
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:31,720
Before... I just let him do what he wanted.

495
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,660
That's how I thought I'd keep him next to me.

496
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:39,480
But that man... No matter what he does, he's mine.

497
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:44,900
I'm going to do as I please with what is mine. So you find a new path.

498
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:48,280
But I'll take care of you thinking of the years that you two shared.

499
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:52,060
I received plenty of money while we were together.

500
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:57,140
Be thankful that you lead a life

501
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,300
where you can at least receive money in this kind of situation.

502
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:21,720
Tell Secretary Song to take care of Hannam-dong.

503
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,080
It'll be nice if she goes abroad.

504
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,020
Okay.

505
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:28,960
Call Chang Soo's mom and tell her I want to see her.

506
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,820
No, I'll call her myself.

507
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:44,940
I was a little shocked that you asked to meet.

508
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:50,180
There must be a lot of things on your mind lately...

509
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,900
How is the President?

510
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:55,640
It's not that big of a deal. He's being discharged tomorrow.

511
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,500
But why did you want to meet?

512
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,260
About our children.

513
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:05,200
Chang Soo and Yoon Ha.

514
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,860
Chang Soo and Yoon Ha?

515
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,680
The last time they met, there was miscommunication.

516
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:16,880
From what I heard, Yoon Ha was seeing someone...

517
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,120
No, they made a big deal out of nothing.

518
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,380
Is that so?

519
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:26,720
She lived abroad since she was young.

520
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,580
So she doesn't have many friends here.

521
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:32,160
But I hear the two of them get along well.

522
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,080
It seems like Yoon Ha likes Chang Soo.

523
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,720
I saw that she called him several times.

524
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:41,640
We think that if the two of them like each other,

525
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,820
then it'll be good for them to be together.

526
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,210
Well...

527
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:54,130
I'm a little wary of the fact that she had a dating scandal.

528
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:57,760
Well, then, there's nothing we can do about that.

529
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:04,170
There's not that much we can do about youth who date before marriage.

530
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:09,080
Well, it's not to say that this is out of the question for good.

531
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,960
I'll talk it over with Chang Soo.

532
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:34,290
This is my place of work. Aren't you coming by too often?

533
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:37,060
How many times have I come by?

534
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,990
Did you meet Si On?

535
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:42,620
Yeah, I did.

536
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:45,520
She was really funny. She kept trying to argue with me.

537
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:50,360
I understood what you were saying. In the ten minutes I was with her, she made my insides turn 12 times.

538
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,960
I told you. I wasn't being like that for no reason.

539
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,980
I also met Yoon Ha's mom because she called me.

540
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:00,470
She wants to marry you and Yoon Ha.

541
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:02,810
What? Does that even make sense?

542
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:04,890
I told her no at first, too.

543
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:07,660
You said no at first and then yes later on?

544
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:10,170
I told her I'd think about it.

545
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:14,970
But your dad really likes it. Becoming in-laws with Taejin.

546
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,320
I'd rather meet Si On.
- Why?

547
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:22,540
She met Joon Gi. Ji Yi and she are friends. What am I an animal?

548
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:26,850
Humans are animals. Don't think too highly of life.

549
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:29,360
You and Yoon Ha understand and like each other.

550
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,390
Like a little sister. Not as a woman.

551
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:36,690
Yoon Ha seems to have entrusted her family with marriage.

552
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:42,740
Why did she break up with Joon Gi? Joon Gi wouldn't have broken up with her... Why did she dump him?

553
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,440
Just act like this didn't happen with me.

554
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:48,680
What are you going to do? You think you can get married at this rate?

555
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:52,160
I'll live with you. Let's just live together.

556
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,730
Let's live together the two of us. Divorce dad and let's live together!

557
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:55,740
Hey!

558
00:42:55,740 --> 00:43:00,180
I'm really surprised at the adults who are trying to put me and Yoon Ha together.

559
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:03,670
That's why we have diamonds. Because we have power.

560
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:06,470
The kind of power that can take seemingly unbelievable things into reality.

561
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:09,220
Mom.
- I'm going to move forward.

562
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:12,350
If you keep acting this way regarding marriage,

563
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:15,380
I'm going to keep pushing you towards this.

564
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:23,870
I'm going to go crazy.

565
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:33,290
Deputy, this is the revenue for the cosmetics that are in the US.

566
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:34,490
Okay. Thank you.

567
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:40,090
This is... my thanks for being my emotional trash can yesterday.

568
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,680
This is a little weak.

569
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,850
Ah. It is weak.

570
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:46,960
Shall I buy lunch?

571
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,860
This is so delicious!

572
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:02,840
But why don't you keep going after Yoon Ha?

573
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:07,580
She doesn't like me. And I deserve it.

574
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:10,860
Why do you deserve it?

575
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:17,200
I think that she's going overboard. Of course, if there's someone you like, you try to make a good impression and become friends.

576
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:22,240
And how great is money! If you have a lot of money, you can also be charming.

577
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,290
You liked her for her charm.

578
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:28,180
Thank you. It's kind of comforting.

579
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:31,800
I have to pay you back for comforting me.

580
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,030
There's no such thing as free.

581
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:41,710
Regarding Yoon Ha, the company doesn't seem to be receiving her well.

582
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:44,840
Besides the thing with you.

583
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,080
I didn't know.

584
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:53,090
It's because they think you're dating her so they don't tell you. I've just overheard a few things in the bathroom.

585
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:55,010
Why don't they like her?

586
00:44:55,010 --> 00:45:01,500
When you were at Yoo Min Department Store, did Yoon Ha call you and make you wait once?

587
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:06,240
Because of that, people are saying that she used her position in the company to win in her love life.

588
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,670
That she's just skinny and pretty and not cut out for work.

589
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:13,350
That Jang Ye Won needs to be the successor.

590
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:19,030
The way I see it, it's because she's lost her ambition.

591
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:25,810
Before she met you, she was working hard and had plans for her future with the hope that she would find true love.

592
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:29,910
But now... she lost hope because of me?

593
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:35,620
The thing she really wants is to live faithfully in love.

594
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:38,890
But now she's become a woman of compulsory ambition.

595
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:44,100
I have to help her but...

596
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:47,180
I can't live with her.

597
00:45:55,820 --> 00:46:00,810
We have these brands in the Shanghai department store, can you import them?

598
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:03,560
Is there no one else in your network besides me?

599
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,490
It seems like you're only asking me.

600
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:09,240
Please just do it. You're the most comfortable. And even if you refuse me, I won't get hurt.

601
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,500
Did you not hear anything from your mother?

602
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,590
What?

603
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:17,670
Can you wait a little bit, Ji Yi?

604
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:21,180
Nevermind. If you haven't heard anything, then nevermind.

605
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:24,610
I'll tell them to try.

606
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:26,560
Thanks.

607
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:31,310
I was talking to Chang Soo because of department store stuff.

608
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:33,370
Okay.

609
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:36,030
Do you not like me talking to Chang Soo?

610
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:39,660
No, it's for work. It's okay.

611
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:41,870
It's not okay.

612
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:45,710
I understand.

613
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:51,220
But you're lucky. The people who love you, love you for you.

614
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:55,120
When you put the fact that I have nothing like that, It's really nice.

615
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,670
But I'm still jealous of you.

616
00:46:57,670 --> 00:46:58,590
Why?

617
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:02,390
If you want, you can have the love of your life. Deputy Choi.

618
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:06,340
Were we in love? I put on a one-man show by myself.

619
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:10,290
I acted so smart and met a man who uses marriage to climb the social ladder.

620
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:15,310
Innocent love, whatever. I'm so embarrassed.

621
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:18,040
Most of all, I'm embarrassed to stand in front of my mom.

622
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,240
I argued so much with her.

623
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:26,070
You mother lived a life more embarrassing than yours. Why are you embarrassed before her?

624
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:31,810
Hearing that from someone else, hurts my heart.

625
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:33,890
Did I talk about my mom like that?

626
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:35,670
Oh, I'm sorry!

627
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:41,350
I was just trying to make you feel better but I touched your family... Ugh, I shouldn't have brought your family into this.

628
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:45,410
The President... Your father, how is he?

629
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:46,650
He's well.

630
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:52,010
I'm relieved. It was so hard to get into this company. Nothing bad can happen to it!

631
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:57,120
If our cosmetics sell well in China, is that good for you?

632
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:57,940
Of course.

633
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:00,020
You see...

634
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:02,350
I have an idea. Can I try it?

635
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:04,010
Do it!
- Even if it's embarrassing?

636
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:06,020
Of course.

637
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:13,160
Taejin cosmetics. #chaeboldaughterhotitem #hotpicktint #ordinarydaughteritem #

638
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:28,360
He's coming out! President Jang, how is your health now?

639
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,350
Please, look here once!

640
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:40,270
President Jang received surgery and was discharged today.

641
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:46,950
After the death of Jang Gyeong Joon, Taejin Group is investing in a lot of projects regarding their future.

642
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:51,010
The President is being discharged.

643
00:48:55,360 --> 00:49:00,480
I didn't think family was anything,

644
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,190
but it's not nothing.

645
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:07,640
When you're sick, no one is allowed in except for family.

646
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:12,150
Now that he's discharged, he'll come soon.

647
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:15,030
I don't think it'll be that easy.

648
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,990
When people are sick, they're vulnerable.

649
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:24,630
He's not the type of person that bends... Just breaks. So it'll be difficult.

650
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:28,720
His wife is strong... Unlike before.

651
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:32,060
She told me that he's her man.

652
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:38,280
How is that possible? They've used separate rooms for over 10 years.

653
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,280
It's possible between husband and wife.

654
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,970
It's possible?

655
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:43,880
Is marriage really that great?

656
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:50,610
They made a life together from youth to old age.

657
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:56,090
I guess she loved the President.

658
00:49:56,090 --> 00:50:01,490
That makes no sense! If she loved him, why put up with the affairs?

659
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:04,060
I, alone, was with him for over 10 years.

660
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:09,860
Because if she didn't leave it alone, maybe she thought he would leave...

661
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:12,710
That's loving him more.

662
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,830
She must have been so unhappy.

663
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:23,640
Because she was so unhappy, it must have been harder for the children.

664
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:26,080
Why are you bringing that up?

665
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:31,830
If the mother is unhappy, it's hard for the children to be happy.

666
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:39,240
But you're a happy person, why did you son go around like that?

667
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:42,460
What did he do?

668
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:45,000
It sounded like Yoon Ha was the one who was deceived.

669
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,940
He only dated daughters from rich families.

670
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:52,480
My child won't do something like that.

671
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,730
How can a parent know his or her child?

672
00:50:54,730 --> 00:51:00,260
My mother doesn't know that I'm a mistress...
You think she knows?

673
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:11,030
Please come inside.

674
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:20,680
Why is Mom suddenly like that? Why did she become so affectionate? Are couples supposed to be like that?

675
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:23,810
Unni, you were married once. Tell me.

676
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:25,630
I don't know.

677
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:41,330
Unni, did you see how Father was holding Yoon Ha's hand while the reporters were taking pictures of them?

678
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:42,200
I saw.

679
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,870
He's trying to give Yoon Ha some power. Are you being pushed down by her?

680
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:47,490
Why would I do that?

681
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:50,930
You should be careful. What do you lack for you to get pushed by Yoon Ha?

682
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:54,410
I like playing. I like moderation.

683
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:57,330
Don't touch my life.

684
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:04,890
Lie down.

685
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:08,940
What are you doing? Am I a kid?

686
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:12,290
I took care of Hannam-dong.

687
00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:17,490
Who told you to? I'll be the one who decides whether or not I want to do it.

688
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:22,940
I found out this time that you, Jang Won Shik, are mine.

689
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:27,020
I didn't think that it was possible for you to get hurt.

690
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:29,470
I didn't think that it was possible for you to die.

691
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:33,010
Just because I collapsed once, don't overreact.

692
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:35,150
Don't act so strong.

693
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:43,490
You told me to protect myself, right?

694
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:47,400
I, who lived as Jang Won Shik 's wife,

695
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:52,950
I didn't know what that was, but I found out after you collapsed.

696
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:57,440
It seems like the reason why I hated you

697
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:01,010
was because I wanted to be loved.

698
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,160
Now that I think of it, I was so bad.

699
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:11,710
I was. What was I so scared of?

700
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:14,620
Why was it so hard to admit that I still like

701
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:21,930
you, who fools around with another woman.

702
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:27,780
Lie down.

703
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,780
Don't kid around.

704
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,250
Huh?

705
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:10,690
Please leave now.

706
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:19,450
What? The USB!

707
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:30,840
Are you safeguarding that USB well?

708
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:40,760
What are you doing?

709
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,340
What are you doing here?

710
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:45,290
Let's talk.

711
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:49,700
Why is this broken?

712
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:58,150
I found a person who is suitable to become your partner.

713
00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:01,580
I want you to see Chang Soo, who you met before, again.

714
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:02,950
No.

715
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:07,710
Why not? Ye Won said that you get along with Chang Soo well.

716
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:10,330
This time, we are talking about

717
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:13,940
co-funding a business with Yoo Min Group.

718
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:16,690
Yoo Min Department Store and Taejin

719
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:19,030
can benefit from each other.

720
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:22,720
Chang Soo is dating someone.

721
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,610
Dating someone?

722
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:26,510
And she's my friend.

723
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:28,310
Please find another person.

724
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:30,220
Really?

725
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:35,510
But why are you listening to me so well lately?

726
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:41,150
I'm embarrassed at my life.

727
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:46,140
The love I wanted always avoided me.

728
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:51,380
I thought that I would be good at working, but it was all because of my brother.

729
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:56,140
While I was working part-time at the market, he was my problem solver.

730
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:01,680
You won't be as embarrassed as me.

731
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:09,100
You must think that love must only have 100% innocence, without any faults.

732
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:12,390
Love can be started from calculations.

733
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:18,650
Love, which was started innocently, could end up with calculations.

734
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:23,850
When something is innocent, it doesn't mean that it doesn't have any impurities.

735
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:26,260
It's when you purify all that

736
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:30,030
and work hard in order for it to turn pure.

737
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:35,130
A person who doesn't have any impurities isn't innocent but naive.

738
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:40,540
If you are naive, it's easier for you to be used and abandoned.

739
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:42,990
Think that this was a life lesson.

740
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:48,490
Why?

741
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:51,970
It seems like you are my mother.

742
00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:54,570
Mother...

743
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:59,990
I've never not been your mother.

744
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:16,620
Chang Soo! Meet Yoon Ha today.

745
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:17,920
Do I just have to meet her?

746
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:21,950
For now, you have to try your best. It's better if you talk about marriage as well.

747
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:23,560
Do you really want to do this?

748
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:28,280
Yeah. I trusted you with women, but I don't trust you anymore.

749
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:32,040
You might do something useless again. I'm going to try everything in a short time.

750
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:34,860
I would rather marry Si On, not Yoon Ha.

751
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:36,990
It's enough. Leave.

752
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:42,400
Deputy, Deputy! I put our company's cosmetics in my SNS.

753
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,000
The response is great.

754
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,500
Oh, it seems like it.

755
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:49,360
I didn't tell Yoon Ha, but I should. Do you want to come with me?

756
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:52,790
No.
- Let's go together!

757
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:58,280
Where are you?

758
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,330
Ji Yi wanted to see me.

759
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:05,100
Really? But you have to see me today as well.

760
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:08,180
Why? Is it about our marriage?

761
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:10,070
I already heard from my mother.

762
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:12,370
I have to see you for a moment because of that.

763
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:14,810
There is a mission I must accomplish.

764
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:21,840
How does it make sense for us two to be together?

765
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,220
It doesn't make sense.

766
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:27,690
It doesn't make sense, right? But my mother told me to meet you today.

767
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:29,660
I have to be earnest.

768
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:32,300
What do you want to protect, even while going this far?

769
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:37,160
I don't know. What do I want to protect?

770
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:38,940
I'm curious as well.

771
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:41,020
Don't you miss Ji Yi?

772
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:47,230
Don't talk about Ji Yi. Our Ji Yi is too good for bastards like me.

773
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:49,430
That's true.

774
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,630
Shall we talk about Joon Gi?

775
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:56,890
Seriously, you can't stand to be the only one who gets the shorter end of a stick.

776
00:58:56,890 --> 00:58:59,090
Of course not.

777
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:05,590
But seriously, can we really not work things out?

778
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:08,850
If I have to marry someone without love,

779
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:12,100
you are not bad.
