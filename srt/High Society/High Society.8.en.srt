1
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,280
What are you girls?

2
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,000
What?

3
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,200
I'm not going to say what you want to hear.

4
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,260
What do I want to hear?

5
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,880
You thought I was going to fall for it, huh?

6
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,160
Can't you just say that I look pretty? I took the time and effort to dress up.

7
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,280
Yoon Ha, you now know why you need a friend who is a girl, right?

8
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,240
You're right. They could say I'm pretty a hundred times...

9
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,030
Ah, that makes me cringe. This is why I don't like you two sticking together.

10
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,360
What's the schedule for today?

11
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,060
There are two courses, so look forward to it. Of course, it's two days and one night.

12
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,200
Should we go now?

13
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,280
Do you want to go, too?

14
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,380
I don't really like this kind of stuff.

15
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,040
Me, too.

16
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,380
I want to match Ji Yi's mood.

17
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:20,200
♫Ever since I was young my eyes were a bit different. No matter how pretty, if there wasn't enough in the back, my eyes didn't go.♫

18
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:28,320
♫Long straight hair blowing in the wind, fragile like the wind will blow her away, I don't like that.♫

19
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,280
♫Such a narrow waist, but big hips. It's hard to find pants that fit. Oh, yeah.♫

20
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,620
♫ Shake that booty, that booty-booty. Shake that booty, that booty-booty ♫

21
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:41,270
♫From the front you look so decent, but from the back I might go crazy. Oh, yeah.♫

22
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,550
♫ Shake that booty, that booty-booty. Shake that booty, that booty-booty ♫

23
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:59,120
She's dating this kind of man? I see she's not in her right mind.

24
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,380
It seems their relationship has progressed a lot.

25
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,540
When Yoon Ha didn't come home, it seems she was with Choi Joon Gi.

26
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,080
It was like she was born yesterday.

27
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,180
Ever since she wanted to work part-time, it seemed a bit suspicious.

28
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,820
What am I doing with someone who's not even worthy of being an opponent?

29
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,180
Those two... leak their story to the press.

30
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:25,680
A chaebol daughter part-time worker and an elite commoner boy's love.

31
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,000
Wrapping the story up like the movie "Notting Hill."

32
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I understand.

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,440
Before Dad finds out and flips, we have to tie those two together no matter what.

34
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,920
Do you perhaps know Choi Joon Gi?

35
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,540
Who are you?

36
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:48,060
I'm his classmate from high school. I just can't get in contact with him.

37
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,680
Ah, really? He's my son.

38
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,680
Hello, Mother.

39
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,260
Do you want to come inside for some tea?

40
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,700
Is that alright?

41
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,240
You're his friend so, of course, that's okay.

42
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,610
But why can't you get in contact with him?

43
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,290
I'll tell you inside.

44
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,010
I'll go back to my car first. I have something to give you.

45
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,530
What is this?

46
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:17,210
Ah, please eat this. I didn't want to come empty-handed, so I brought this.

47
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,990
You don't seem like his friend.

48
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,410
You're right. I'm not his friend.

49
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,430
Oh, yes.

50
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:37,580
I want to scout him. So I came to look good to the parents first.

51
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:42,860
It's his affair, so he decides. We don't have power over him.

52
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,580
Anyway, thank you. For looking at our child in a good light.

53
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,620
No problem.

54
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,400
Eat. Also, I can't accept this.

55
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,620
If our child found out, he wouldn't like it.

56
00:04:54,620 --> 00:05:00,360
Give it to me later, if Joon Gi decides to come onboard your company.

57
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,880
Okay.

58
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,900
I don't really know you, Joon Gi.

59
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,520
Whether the you that I know is you or not...I'm not sure.

60
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,600
It's because you only care about yourself. Everyone matches up to you.

61
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,000
Even if everyone in the world says that, shouldn't you be the one that doesn't?

62
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,460
You don't know me either.

63
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,700
Hello?

64
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,760
I'm Hae Joon, Yoon Hae Joon.

65
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,820
Do you remember me? I'm your high school classmate.

66
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,530
Yeah.

67
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:01,990
I've been contacting Joon Gi for a while. I'm a daily news reporter.

68
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,050
What's up?

69
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,730
In the past, I think I went a little overboard on you.

70
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:09,210
Since we're older now, I wanted us to get along.

71
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,270
Okay.

72
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:14,360
Ah, Joon Gi is giving me a lot of economy-related news sources. We have a symbiotic relationship.

73
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,440
So we should get along well, too.

74
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,750
I got it. I'll see if I have time later.

75
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,990
Where is the next course?

76
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,070
My villa.

77
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,290
Ah, Joon Gi is giving me a lot of economy-related news sources.

78
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:38,370
We have a symbiotic relationship.

79
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:48,460
Find out who the reporter is for the very first article on Jang Yoon Ha.

80
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,520
Also, change my phone number starting next week.

81
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,620
High Society
Episode 8

82
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:14,360
♫ Tears come when I look at you ♫

83
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,260
♫ My heart fills to the brim and ends up beating towards you ♫

84
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:28,140
♫ No one knows how I feel but if it's you, would you know? ♫

85
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:33,940
♫ All day, soft and gentle words enter my ear ♫

86
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:38,860
♫ Your name is stuck on my lips ♫

87
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:46,490
♫ No one knows how I feel. Will my heart reach you? ♫

88
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,810
♫ Closer to you ♫

89
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:52,420
Ah! Hey!

90
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,660
Should we go in?

91
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,160
I'm all wet!

92
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,520
What do you mean you're all wet?
- Ah, I said I'm all wet!

93
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,400
♫ When you smile because of those ticklish words ♫

94
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:10,990
♫ Maybe someone might secretly see our love ♫

95
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:15,030
♫ You're closer to my heart ♫

96
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:24,450
♫ You're in me even more ♫

97
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,040
Do you need help with anything?

98
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,220
Do you want to help me move all this?

99
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,760
Yes!
- I want to help, too.

100
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,420
You want to do all sorts of things.
- You want to do all sorts of things.

101
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,990
Deputy, this must not be your first time here.

102
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,720
I think I come here a few times a year.

103
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,230
Let's go.

104
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,500
Hurry up and come!

105
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,980
You're going to fall, be careful.

106
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,270
I won't fall.

107
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:59,320
Whatever you bring is useless. Joon Gi has to come, of course.

108
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:04,290
I'll do it.

109
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,980
Did you see Yoon Ha's gaze just now?

110
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,450
What gaze?

111
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,000
Don't do this for other girls from now on.

112
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,570
She's slightly disappointed right now.

113
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:16,850
No!

114
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:21,170
In the beginning when Deputy poured water instead of alcohol for Yoon Ha and refilled her boiled potatoes,

115
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:24,190
we were touched by these kinds of things.

116
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:27,170
What's so great about that, for you to be so moved?

117
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,630
That's why a man and woman's definition of what moves them is different.

118
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:33,810
You think girls like it if you just buy them expensive things and take them to nice places, don't you?

119
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,840
It's not that? All the girls I know like that.

120
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,360
Girls that you know, like who?

121
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,530
How could you easily say you know a lot of girls like it doesn't mean anything? Making Ji Yi feel hurt.

122
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,690
Yoon Ha, my heart is your heart.

123
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:47,290
From now on, the four of us shouldn't meet together.

124
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,470
I'll grill the meat now.

125
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,850
I grill meat well, too!

126
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:56,010
How could you girls be good at grilling meat? What about the wine?

127
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:56,930
I didn't bring it.

128
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,990
I'll go get it!

129
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,190
Wow, her words and her actions are in tune.

130
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,570
She's originally the best at gestures.

131
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,790
Where does she think it is?

132
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,370
Where do you think it is?

133
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:12,590
It's here. I saw it.

134
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,310
It's a relief that you didn't come unknowingly.

135
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:18,410
I wouldn't have come unknowingly. I came because I'm confident.

136
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,310
You don't have white wine?

137
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:28,630
I do. You like white wine?

138
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:34,410
I think white whine is best for when you're with guys. When you drink red wine it goes to your lips.

139
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,400
Because you don't want to show that image to Joon Gi?

140
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,900
Bingo!

141
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,130
You like him that much?
- Yeah.

142
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,750
You haven't dated a lot of men, have you?

143
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:49,230
Ah, really. Why is everyone saying I haven't dated before?

144
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,380
I said I've dated before!

145
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,740
Alright, you've dated a lot.

146
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,010
That's why you should know well. What men become.

147
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,540
What do they become?

148
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,630
Don't give all of yourself.

149
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,940
What's giving everything?

150
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:06,170
Your heart. Don't give your whole heart. Leave some of it.

151
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:07,630
I already gave it all.

152
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,040
Hey.

153
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,280
If I wasn't going to give my whole heart, why would I date him?

154
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,200
If you just say that you won't give them your feelings then can it not happen?

155
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,880
Let's go outside.

156
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,650
I can't win a conversation about love against girls.

157
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,550
Don't be like that to Ji Yi.

158
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,710
Don't be like what?

159
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,780
If you love her, marrying her is common sense.

160
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,050
Are you saying you're going to marry Joon Gi then?

161
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,670
Of course. He's the man I want.

162
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,270
He's not a gram too much or too less.

163
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:37,190
Would it go your way? Your rank has completely changed from before.

164
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:41,670
I heard that they're putting you on the front lines for Taejin Group's image makeover.

165
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:46,270
My marriage has nothing to do with the company. If I can't marry the way I want, what's the point of living?

166
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:49,590
Don't you have the mind to keep the rank you have?

167
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:52,620
Look at my older brother. He likes the fact that I'm dating Ji Yi.

168
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,480
If you marry Joon Gi, So Hyeon Noona and Ye Won Noona will probably like that, too.

169
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,210
Do you know how shabby it gets for kids like us to try and catch our parents' eye?

170
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:07,630
Even if my background changes, I've made an effort up until now to not be hit with as big of a blow.

171
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,810
At times like this, I'm thankful to my mom.

172
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:13,140
She helped me to become independent early.

173
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,280
Deputy, you're so respect-worthy.

174
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,610
Why?

175
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:32,970
Your personality is good, you're smart, and you protect girls.

176
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:36,180
I do? That's a bit cringy.

177
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:40,350
How were you when you found out Yoon Ha is the daughter of a rich family?

178
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,330
I was a bit sad.

179
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:48,770
I guess imagination stays with you even in reality.

180
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:51,460
All this time, there were many hints.

181
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:54,550
But I never thought she was from a rich family.

182
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:58,210
I thought she had a similar background to me.

183
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,910
What are you going to do with Chang Soo?

184
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,260
I don't have a plan to do anything.

185
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,410
He isn't someone that I can plan with.

186
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,130
We came all the way here without a plan.

187
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:12,200
Even if his condition is good,

188
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:17,010
don't forget that your own overall strength is stronger.

189
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,580
Are you worrying about me right now?

190
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,840
I guess.

191
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:29,030
Worry about yourself! I don't need to. I'm not an idiot.

192
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:32,500
If events like that happen in dramas, I say it doesn't make sense.

193
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,810
How could something like that really happen?

194
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:37,570
Don't try too hard to make it happen.

195
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:41,640
Even a man-woman relationship won't beat all of the relationships of people.

196
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,660
Don't forget your true feelings.

197
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:48,080
Thank you. You're a good man, just as I thought.

198
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,120
I feel reassured that Yoon Ha has you.

199
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,620
Give it to me, I'll put it there.

200
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,580
The wine is here!

201
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:06,030
If Joon Gi and I got girlfriends, we were thinking about doing this kind of thing.

202
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,090
This day came fast.

203
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:11,340
Yoon Ha and I also, if we got boyfriends, we were always going to meet them together.

204
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,300
I didn't think it would come this fast.

205
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,020
Let's cheer.

206
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:19,230
All together, cheers to our youth.

207
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:23,410
That's a bit old. Don't you have anything else, Deputy Manager?

208
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:26,070
What's with "Deputy Manager?" We're not at work right now.

209
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,160
Then what should I call him?

210
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,390
That's right. And what's with calling me Director?

211
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,160
Why are you two ganging up on me?

212
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,260
Deputy! Deputy, you have to help me out here.

213
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,190
I also don't think "Deputy Manager" is right either.

214
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,280
Ah, what the heck!

215
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,770
Let's stop. She's going to cry.

216
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:45,170
You can just call us oppa. Why don't you two say oppa?

217
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,520
Other girls live their lives saying oppa.

218
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,400
Oppa? The oppa I met as a director?

219
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,000
That's a bit awkward. What do you think?

220
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,380
Moreover, you can call me oppa.

221
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,840
So Hyeon Noona had something with my second older brother in the past.

222
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,600
You and I almost became in-laws.

223
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,950
Yoon Ha!

224
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,760
I can't make the word oppa come out of my mouth.

225
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,760
Let's go get some air.

226
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:37,800
It will be okay. Deputy Choi will calm her down.

227
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,080
Ah, he's Deputy again? Because of your whole "Deputy" deal this happened.

228
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,390
Alright, Oppa. Stop it.

229
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:48,320
I should drink a glass, too. I knew Yoon Ha's brother, too.

230
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,860
It makes me think of him.

231
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,910
Would you be fine with wine?
- Don't drink.

232
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:57,410
I don't want to see you crying, too.
- I won't drink.

233
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,430
Hey!

234
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,680
What did the building team say?

235
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,360
If we report him as dead, all of Jang President's possessions would go to the hall.

236
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,550
We would have to pay a lot of taxes.

237
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:18,280
Because of the taxes,

238
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,590
I went through the hardships to fight with time to give many things to Gyeong Joon in advance.

239
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:25,530
Since his body was never discovered,

240
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:29,960
if you don't report him as dead, you can leave him as missing.

241
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:34,110
Until we receive the missing sentence, it's five years if we take care of the absentee's property,

242
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:37,630
Jang President's composition management, property management, can be taken care of.

243
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:41,360
Alright. Then we can see it in five years.

244
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,320
Who has the chance to manage the absentee property?

245
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,630
I'm afraid since Madam is the guardian with custody...

246
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:53,770
Although there is no chance, but if Madam gives it up and pushes it to you,

247
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:56,810
it could be you.

248
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,980
Let's go with real circumstances.

249
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,750
Make sure it doesn't leak to her and move with secrecy.

250
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,540
Yes, President.

251
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,430
Choi Joon Gi's parents are spoken highly of in the neighborhood.

252
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:16,200
They also had a good impression, were humble, and it seemed like they were living nicely without greed.

253
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,260
What you see can trick you.

254
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,910
Choi Joon Gi has many enemies in the company.

255
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:24,510
He joined with the coincidence that he was high school comrades with Director Yoo Chang Soo.

256
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:28,530
If Director Yoo Chang Soo inherits the Yoomin Department Store, the management section

257
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,910
is rumored to go to Choi Joon Gi.

258
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,880
Because he is one of Yoo Chang Soo's men, there seems to be an advantage.

259
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,090
So he's an ambitious man? Is he smart?

260
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,530
Yes.

261
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:43,790
And since he's poor, he probably grew up knowing what money really means.
- Yes.

262
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:46,980
Yoon Ha is someone he really needs in many aspects.

263
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,760
In any case, she'll be of great strength to him.

264
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,650
I left my business card so he will call.

265
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,500
Let's see how it plays out and think about it.

266
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:02,660
There is word that the President is planning on not filing Jang Gyeong Joon President as dead.

267
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:06,030
I thought it was weird, ever since they revealed the will.

268
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:09,570
They tried so hard to increase Gyeong Joon's property.

269
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:14,430
If reported dead, the inheritance tax would skyrocket. There's no way he would overlook that.

270
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:18,830
For the company, Madam's situation, it seems she is going to apply for absentee property manager.

271
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:24,570
If we combine Gyeong Joon's 12% of stocks and Mom's 7% of stocks, it's 19%.

272
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,950
I definitely have to get Mom on my side.

273
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:33,120
Whether she becomes the guardian or the absentee property manager,

274
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,000
Mom will follow whatever belief and become different now.

275
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,110
Is lunch ready?
- Yes.

276
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,560
The President will come in soon.

277
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,150
The President is coming.

278
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,190
You're back.

279
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,640
Is Yoon Ha here?
- She went out.

280
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,910
Lunch is ready, so wash your hands and come.

281
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:13,430
Yoon Ha...she doesn't have any of Taejin's shares?

282
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:18,540
Yes. She only has small stocks of unlisted companies.

283
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:23,140
The guy she's meeting...give him fear.

284
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,030
I understand, President.

285
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,530
Let's talk.

286
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:46,100
Speak.

287
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,340
Everyone leave for a bit.

288
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:01,610
I will not report Gyeong Joon's death.

289
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,280
You've thought well.

290
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,690
There's no way he died.

291
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:16,110
Gyeong Joon's property, if we report him as dead, Hye In's inheritance tax will really rise.

292
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:20,950
Since in reality, the missing filing will take five years, we must be cautious.

293
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:24,540
So?

294
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:28,900
We're going to apply for absentee property management, so you need to get it in motion.

295
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,730
Why are you not answering?

296
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,140
I understand.

297
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:19,310
Hello?

298
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:21,440
Mom?

299
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,650
Mom!
-Yeah.

300
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,380
I'm heading home right now.

301
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:30,260
Why?
- You like going to exhibits.

302
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,120
I'll take you. Get ready.

303
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,290
I'm not feeling up for it.
-Don't be like that. Let's go.

304
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:39,990
If you keep staying at home, your mood will worsen. We'll eat a delicious dinner, too.

305
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:44,750
Chef Togok's cooking that you like so much... I made reservations.

306
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,130
Okay, I got it.

307
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,690
The end of tears takes long, I see.

308
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:28,250
I shouldn't have gotten off the plane.

309
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,930
If we went together,

310
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:37,180
he might have not gotten hurt.

311
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:48,070
This won't do.

312
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,580
What are you doing?

313
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:53,170
I'll help you change into different thoughts.

314
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:57,530
Don't! Ah, really!

315
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:02,010
Ah! Wait!

316
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:05,330
What are you doing? Ah!

317
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,390
You're mean, really.

318
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:14,910
♫ As much as I am holding back from you ♫

319
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:23,980
♫ It may hurt but I have to hold back from you ♫

320
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:36,050
It's a relief that Yoon Ha has Deputy Manager.

321
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:42,150
Yeah.

322
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:47,120
Jang Yoon Ha's article was first released by Reporter Yoon Hae Joon.

323
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,990
I got it.

324
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:53,710
Joon Gi is giving me a lot of economy-related news sources.

325
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:57,030
Did something happen?

326
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,530
No.

327
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:03,200
Who manages the part-time workers?
-Our leader does it.

328
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,660
It wasn't the Deputy Manager?

329
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,440
Deputy Manager doesn't do that.

330
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,670
Then how did you and Joon Gi know each other? You already knew each others' names and were acquainted.

331
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:14,490
In the past, employees wore their name tags. Although they don't do that anymore.

332
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:17,870
They don't do that anymore?
- Yes, they don't do that.

333
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,930
How do you know Jang Yoon Ha?

334
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:27,550
You don't know?
-Do I know her?

335
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,440
Hey!

336
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:37,900
The Tae Jin Group's daughter I asked you to research last time and the Food Market part-time worker, Jang Yoon Ha. They are the same person.

337
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:41,650
You're not going to ask? Why a chaebol daughter is working at the supermarket?

338
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:44,310
Is the princess improving her refinement?

339
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,550
What are you thinking about?

340
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,580
Nothing much.

341
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:58,180
You want to know all of my thoughts?

342
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:02,680
Yes, I want to walk all around the inside of your brain.

343
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:08,280
What did you do?

344
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,610
I should wash up.
-Let's go inside together.

345
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:19,010
You're not going in?

346
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,790
Joon Gi.

347
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:29,790
About Yoon Ha...when did you know?

348
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:34,110
That the Jang Yoon Ha who went on an arranged marriage date with me and the part-timer Jang Yoon Ha are the same person?

349
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:40,330
Did you find out after I told you in the car last time?

350
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:44,570
Why are you curious about that?

351
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:52,370
No, just curious as to why a smart guy like you couldn't connect this and that together.

352
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:55,790
Those thoughts suddenly came to my mind.

353
00:25:55,790 --> 00:26:02,540
Those thought don't just suddenly come up. Those things come out after abounding in deep thought.

354
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,750
Why did you pretend not to know?

355
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:08,320
What about you?

356
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,490
Why didn't you tell me?

357
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:17,760
I know right. Why didn't I tell you?

358
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,490
I asked you twice.

359
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:26,370
That's right. When you first asked me, you knew, right?

360
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:33,530
Let's say the first time you didn't answer was because I was bothering you. The second time...

361
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,420
Why didn't you answer?

362
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:45,800
You always say you like me.

363
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,960
I know you like me.

364
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,350
I like you, too.

365
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:57,130
I know that you don't have any wickedness inside of you. You were like that from birth.

366
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:59,270
What do you want to say?

367
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:06,620
Deep within your bones, you have a sense of elitism. If someone is not on the same level as you, you unconsciously draw a line.

368
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,970
What?
- In the past...

369
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:12,550
I acted as if I didn't experience that unconsciousness of yours.

370
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:14,770
But lately...

371
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:19,630
That unconsciousness is slowly changing to consciousness.

372
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:22,300
This is a complete shock.

373
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,120
I thought you were an innocent guy.

374
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,170
But you...you knew who's daughter Yoon Ha was and purposely came onto her.

375
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:33,850
Let's say that's true. But why is that something you should be mad about?

376
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:37,250
The marriage technique you use is reasonable, but the marriage technique I use is immoral?

377
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,350
I'm truthful.

378
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,790
Truthful or not, that's the individual's personal choice.

379
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:45,430
Do I have to get the blame for something like that?
- Even if it's a small matter, you have to get the blame from me.

380
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:51,330
The face you showed me until now wasn't this.

381
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:00,130
You only saw what you wanted to see.

382
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:08,330
You're really a bastard, aren't you?

383
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:12,210
I don't know about other people, but how can you be so twisted?

384
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,070
Stop it!
- Why are you like this?

385
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:28,670
Ah, hold on!

386
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:32,280
Are you okay? Ah, what should I do?

387
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,630
What should I do!

388
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:55,130
Mom, this piece was the one that best brought out the nice features of Artist Kim Hong Do's picture of four gentlemen.

389
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,730
With the artist's skill...

390
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:03,030
The swaying features came to life.

391
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:05,090
Perhaps, Mom,

392
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:08,530
do you have some kind of worry?

393
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:10,490
No.

394
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:13,850
You're not going to meet the man Yoon Ha is dating?

395
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:18,140
Is there a need to meet every man she dates? They might break up.

396
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,300
I think they're serious.

397
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:26,130
Don't you think one of us marrying out of love is good?

398
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:34,790
Why do you think your father and I didn't marry out of love?

399
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:39,210
In your father's younger days,

400
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,490
we loved.

401
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:52,090
Why is it that youth is so short, but old age and nastiness lasts long?

402
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,760
Life is so unfair.

403
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:31,150
My dad said he's going to newly remodel the auditorium soon.

404
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:33,400
It hasn't been that long.

405
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,010
They're coming.

406
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,770
Yoon Hae Joon.

407
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,080
Good morning.

408
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,710
Ah, you woke up early today?

409
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:53,270
Of course. A student has to wake up really early.

410
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,710
But yesterday...

411
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:57,420
Look at them. They're playing amongst themselves.

412
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:01,800
Chang Soo, that bastard, I heard he came in after donating the school auditorium.

413
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:06,380
The girl next to him is Hong Jin Group's daughter, and next to her is Ulsang Company's son.

414
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,020
Aren't they pathetic?

415
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:11,390
They laid the law on this campus and they only hang out with each other.

416
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:16,220
No matter how hard we study, would we become any more than their little playthings in the future?

417
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,820
Isn't life so unfair?

418
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:22,620
From now on I won't have greed.

419
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,590
Only the ones who live well will keep living well.

420
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:37,800
Joon Gi, I'm worried.

421
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,570
Don't worry. Between men,

422
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:46,530
we usually throw punches and show affection like that.

423
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,570
That's a relief.

424
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:54,570
We rode a couple bicycle already. What else do you want to do?

425
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:57,040
No...what do you like?

426
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,000
I like everything I see.

427
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,780
I also like going to exhibits.
- Let's go to an exhibition.

428
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:25,590
Goodbye.

429
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:29,650
I... thank you for dropping me off.

430
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,520
Wait here.

431
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,900
If you leave like this, I don't feel good.

432
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,640
Why are you like this?

433
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:52,740
Don't fight. Don't get hit.

434
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:56,230
I was really scared earlier.

435
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:59,710
Don't worry. Men are like that.

436
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:01,750
Joon Gi and I are like that, too.

437
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,380
Don't do that kind of stuff.

438
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,720
Okay.

439
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:14,080
I won't.

440
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,300
You've worked hard.

441
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,530
See you later.

442
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:51,950
Hello.

443
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:55,690
Have you been well?

444
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,460
Don't come here.

445
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,470
What?

446
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:04,680
I said don't come.

447
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:10,910
Okay.

448
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,360
Ye Won,

449
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,180
come to my house to hang out some time.

450
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:25,130
Ahjumma, between people, there's something called distance.

451
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:28,020
I hope you protect that.

452
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:54,340
Why do you not have any energy?

453
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:01,130
They say if it's sweet you swallow, if it's bitter you spit... I feel dirty.

454
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:03,680
Should I make you an iced Americano?

455
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:08,590
Ahjumma, I tried hard to live kindly. And I've been living kindly up until now,

456
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:11,990
but because I lived too kindly, people are...

457
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:14,380
I think they're looking down on me.

458
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,470
Why are you not saying anything? Why are you not agreeing?

459
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,090
I can't lie.

460
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:26,130
What was a lie out of what I said?

461
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:28,950
I don't want to tell you.

462
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:31,480
Ahjumma, you really have subjectivity.

463
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,810
I'll make a delicious dinner for you.

464
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:35,810
Should I cook ribs with spices?

465
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:38,760
Do you think me being kind is a lie?

466
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,500
Then I'll cook ribs.

467
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:53,390
Jang Ye Won...menacing.

468
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:14,920
Hey! I didn't see Deputy as that kind of person, but where does he think he could hit my oppa like that?

469
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,530
Look at this girl. Hey,

470
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:22,290
my Joon Gi was hit as well! It wasn't one-sided, they both hit each other.

471
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:24,730
Chang Soo probably made Joon Gi's blood boil.

472
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:27,650
And that's why they started throwing fists. Even if I didn't see it, it's a clear video.

473
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:31,610
That's not it! Director jerk was freaking out!

474
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:32,590
Did you see?

475
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:35,790
I did! I saw and ran out!

476
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:39,930
Now that I hear it, my mood really sucks. Why did he hit him? He even hit him first.

477
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:44,200
He probably said something that he deserved to be hit for! He always pushes Deputy Choi's buttons well.

478
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,520
Friends close their eyes and let it go.

479
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:51,490
Buttons should be pressed since their friends! Who else would push their buttons?

480
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:56,780
So up until now, you only said "good job, good job," but you didn't mean it?

481
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:59,830
Really! Am I someone who only shows it through words?

482
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:01,980
This won't do. Let's go at it, too!

483
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:07,310
Fine. Let's go at it. Do you want to come or should I go?

484
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:11,670
This is really fascinating.

485
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:16,550
A rich person is rich all right. You even have a place to exercise in your house.

486
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:20,210
It's like some kind of hotel here.

487
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:24,720
But what did they fight about?

488
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:30,610
I know right. They said men are always like that.

489
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:33,310
Oh? Joon Gi said that, too.

490
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:36,630
They said men show affection that way.

491
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:39,240
Why do they show their affection in such a perverted way?

492
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:43,770
I know right. Look at us. We're so humane.

493
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:48,440
I know right. We're fixing our misunderstanding through conversation.

494
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,970
Let's exert ourselves more. For this ignorant world,

495
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:55,840
we have to spread our civilization  quickly.

496
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,940
How should we do that?

497
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,350
Love.

498
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:01,810
Hey!

499
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:14,280
Ji Yi, I have something to tell you. I hope you take it sincerely.

500
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,400
What is it?

501
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:20,630
Uh... Are you going to keep working at the supermarket?

502
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,880
If I don't, what else would I do?

503
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,480
Do you want to work with me?

504
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:34,520
I... have decided to work at the company.

505
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,480
I'm the Team Leader of the Chinese department.

506
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,350
Our company is pushing their luck in China.

507
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:45,060
The sales charge ratio is pretty high.

508
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,590
You've landed an important job.

509
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:53,020
Since it's my first time, everything is unfamiliar and new.

510
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,990
I wanted to have at least one person I'm familiar with and used to.

511
00:39:55,990 --> 00:40:00,130
What kind of work could I do? Your company is huge.

512
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:02,150
I'm only a high school graduate.

513
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,520
What does "high school graduate" have to do with anything?

514
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:09,580
Hey, in my household, there's a world of people who have received a foreign doctoral degree.

515
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,800
Education and character is nothing.

516
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,740
If you weren't my friend, you wouldn't ask to work together.

517
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:21,180
You're right. If we weren't friends, I wouldn't be able to know you.

518
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:32,840
While working part-time, I've hit rock bottom quite a bit.

519
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,160
Rather than having a bad brain, a bad heart is more of a problem.

520
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:43,920
Having a good heart is way better than having a good brain.

521
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,650
It's a job where you create make-up.

522
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:51,610
It's a job that buys women's hearts.

523
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:56,450
When it comes to buying people's hearts, you're a master.

524
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:58,010
I am?

525
00:40:58,010 --> 00:41:03,390
Director jerk and I aren't people who give their hearts out easily.

526
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:06,260
Still, I want to think about it.

527
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:12,130
Seeing Deputy Choi... It doesn't seem good for friends to have a boss-to-employee relationship.

528
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:15,990
We're not a boss-to-employee relationship! It's an equal relationship!

529
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:22,630
We're different from men. We're not the ignorant people that care about status.

530
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,060
I still want to think about it.

531
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:32,720
I understand. Think about it for me. Very deeply.

532
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,770
As I think about it, he comes to mind. Director jerk.

533
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:38,550
Hey!

534
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,300
Oh.

535
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,660
You're coming now?

536
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:48,720
You must be busy playing around everywhere now that you have a girl.

537
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,560
Be on your way, Hyung.

538
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:56,200
He should play while he's young. Why are you on his back about it?

539
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,760
This extent isn't getting on his back!

540
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:03,000
I'm going to my room. The two of you can figure it out.

541
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:11,760
He's sticking around with a girl who has worked part-time at our supermarket for a while now.

542
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,440
I'm so embarrassed.

543
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,060
I get it. Stop getting fired up.

544
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:21,630
Next time, bring the kids here. I want to see them.

545
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:26,600
Tomorrow, the kids are landing here from the United Kingdom. I'll tell them to come see you after tomorrow.

546
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:52,990
You're going around dating a girl from the department store?

547
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:55,390
So what if I am?

548
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:59,930
Although poor, she's refreshing and has a healthy mindset. Is it her?

549
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:02,930
You remember that?

550
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:07,490
I'm your mom. Lately there haven't been just one or two things that caught on me.

551
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:09,390
I just let it pass.

552
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:13,290
Why? Because I trust you.

553
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:21,850
But I keep thinking that if I trust, I'll get stabbed in the back.

554
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:23,500
Mom,

555
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,380
your son's mood is really bad right now.

556
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,860
I want to be alone.

557
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,940
I understand.

558
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,670
Yes, Mother.

559
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:17,840
Joon Gi, do you know the contact information of the part-time girl Chang Soo is dating?

560
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,410
I don't.

561
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,380
Find out and send it to me.

562
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,320
You're really a bastard, aren't you?

563
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:40,500
I don't know about other people, but how can you be so twisted?

564
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:58,850
Even if I date girls and break up, friends won't break up. You're more precious to me than girls.

565
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:01,830
You...why don't you say you like me?

566
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:03,380
A guy acting like such a girl...

567
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:06,800
You have to be affectionate! Follow me.

568
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:12,530
I like you. I really like you.

569
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,760
You only saw what you wanted to see.

570
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,040
Son of a b*tch.

571
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:36,880
Oh, you are here!

572
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,580
Why aren't you out on a date? You're supposed to go out on a date on days like this.

573
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:40,960
We just came back.

574
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:47,080
Good job. Love her a lot and make her very happy.

575
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,220
Why am I the only one having to do it all?

576
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:51,020
When you get married the girls do it all.

577
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:56,600
You want to, too! Seeing you with Yoon Ha, it seems like you like it.

578
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,680
Me?

579
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,460
Yeah.

580
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:03,440
When I first saw Yoon Ha, she left a good impression.

581
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,840
She's continuing to act just like the impression she made.

582
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,420
She...

583
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:10,720
is a part-time worker, but is that okay?

584
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,360
What's so wrong with part-time? If a person is good then that's all that matters.

585
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,840
Your son was well born. Have some greed.

586
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,780
Have some greed for what?

587
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:23,720
Doctor? Lawyer? Forget it.

588
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:28,140
It's best to toil with your own body and earn money to take care of others.

589
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:32,660
If I make a lot, and if I had the power to feed someone else, that'd be even better.

590
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:35,180
Love is not calculated.

591
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:39,140
Why do you only say what comes out in books? Didn't you learn anything while living poorly?

592
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:41,300
Why didn't I learn anything?

593
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:44,720
Even if I didn't, I learned to live happily.

594
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,960
Do you know how hard that is?

595
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,760
I know.

596
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,920
But even if I understand you, I don't understand Dad.

597
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,640
He's a man. Even if he's a man, if he can't do something then he has to accept it.

598
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:03,140
You really won't do. Whose husband are you trying to make a criminal?

599
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:04,100
What?

600
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:08,480
If he can't do something, then why accept it? You're just saying that to mess up and go to jail right now.

601
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:13,040
Even if it doesn't work out, you have to explain well and end it.

602
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,940
I got it.

603
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:18,620
Yesterday, someone came looking for you.

604
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:22,020
He left this and left. He said he wants to scout you.

605
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:23,620
Taejin Group. Lee Tae Geon.

606
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:25,760
But I don't think I like that person.

607
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:26,580
Why?

608
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:28,700
He lied at first.

609
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:31,580
He said he was your high school classmate looking for you.

610
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:35,080
Once I let him in the house, he said he came to scout you.

611
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:41,060
A person who lies from the beginning will continue to lie.

612
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,060
Deputy Choi,

613
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:10,420
from now on, you don't have to come to the company anymore.

614
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:15,920
Your luck is pretty great. Director Yoo, and now your girlfriend, she was Taejin Group's daughter?

615
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:22,280
You knew, right? That Taejin Group's daughter was working here part-time?

616
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:26,420
I thought it was strange. You're not the type of person who would date a part-timer.

617
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:32,200
Just go.

618
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:37,000
Be careful. I'm saying this as your comrade.

619
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,710
Earlier, someone came and asked about you two.

620
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:45,440
I told them everything. How dangerous of a person you are.

621
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:16,590
Am I late?

622
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:19,870
No, you came on time. I was buying the passes so I came a bit early.

623
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:21,210
I see.

624
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:23,090
Let's go inside.

625
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:40,430
For some reason, don't you think this painting suits me?

626
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:46,610
No.

627
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:18,350
I'm working for the company starting next week.

628
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:19,390
You'll probably get busy.

629
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:22,340
Even if I get busy, I'll do everything I should.

630
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:24,040
Alright.

631
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:27,280
Have you made up with Chang Soo?

632
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:30,500
No one makes up that quickly.

633
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,960
Why did you fight?

634
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:39,860
Yoo Chang Soo.

635
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:44,520
It's Chang Soo. He must have known we were talking about him.

636
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:47,060
It's me.

637
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,820
Where are you?

638
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:53,220
Out on a date with Joon Gi.

639
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,520
I got it.

640
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,500
Why?

641
00:50:56,500 --> 00:51:00,440
I have something to tell you. I'll call you again.

642
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,500
He said he has something to tell me.

643
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:22,270
Do you think he's alive just because his body wasn't found?

644
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:25,370
That boy, causing so much chaos even when he's dead.

645
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:32,970
Gyeong Joon's property, if we report him as dead, Hye In's inheritance tax will very much rise.

646
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:55,380
We're going to apply for absentee property management, so you need to get it in motion.

647
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,980
Cold...

648
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,760
You drank again?

649
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:37,640
Now you're even holding the alcohol bottle. What a sight.

650
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:42,240
Jang Won Shik, did you cry?

651
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,920
Did you cry?

652
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,600
What are you talking about?

653
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,720
Did you cry after hearing about Gyeong Joon?

654
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:52,960
Am I not a person? To not cry after that happens to my child.

655
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:57,520
No! You didn't cry!

656
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:03,080
You said he couldn't do anything right and died.

657
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:06,440
Someone who once declared their son as dead, decides to file them as missing instead because of tax, is that a human?

658
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:10,400
That's enough! There's more than just one at fault here.

659
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,020
Until when are you going to keep living like an alcoholic?

660
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:16,320
I want to stop. But I can't!

661
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:19,480
Living people have to live! Think about Hye In's future—

662
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:23,600
Don't stamp it! Hye In's not the future.

663
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:28,060
The only thing important to you right now is keeping your spot!

664
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:33,020
Have you ever thought that you're living well because I'm keeping this spot?

665
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,440
Let's divorce.

666
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:40,680
What?

667
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,800
Let's divorce.

668
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:47,560
I can't live with someone like you.

669
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:51,160
I thought about this hundreds of times every day.

670
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:54,160
Now I think I can do it.

671
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:00,960
I'm tired of hating you.

672
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:38,520
They're documents to be passed on to Director, but you take it.

673
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,800
He's not in his office. It's urgent.

674
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:42,600
I got it.

675
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,640
I'll leave it to you.

676
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:47,540
Chang Soo.

677
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:50,640
The number you just dialed does not exist.

678
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:54,060
To check again, please dial.

679
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:02,120
The number you just dialed does not exist.

680
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:05,180
To check again, please dial.

681
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:07,560
The number you have dialed is-

682
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,780
The Director hasn't come in yet?

683
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:21,060
He has.

684
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:22,540
Can you tell him I'm here?

685
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:24,200
Yes.

686
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:43,920
You came?

687
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,660
Yeah. There are documents that were supposed to be passed on to you.

688
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:54,400
I've thought about it...

689
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:57,520
You're the Deputy Manager.

690
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:05,140
Isn't there a problem with policies if the Deputy Manager personally brings this to me?

691
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,260
Let's keep our policies from now on.

692
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,400
Wouldn't that be better?

693
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:23,380
I'll accept it this time.

694
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,900
Why aren't you saying anything?

695
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:48,080
From whose perspective should I tell you?

696
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:51,940
Friend...or employee?

697
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:56,660
Friend.

698
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:59,480
Am I really a friend to you?

699
00:57:07,870 --> 00:57:11,690
Forget it. You may leave.

700
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:14,250
You're still messing with my sincerity.

701
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:16,630
I know why you're mad.

702
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:24,610
It's because your partner can also become my partner.

703
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:30,570
That's why I didn't tell you. Because I know you.

704
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:34,390
I know a lot about you, Chang Soo.

705
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:41,530
Saying that you like me and saying that you trust me,

706
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:45,510
you didn't have assurance in yourself.

707
00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:48,530
Expressing myself would reassure you.

708
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:56,430
I predicted these actions.

709
00:57:56,430 --> 00:57:59,550
Yoo Chang Soo is immature, just as I thought.

710
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:04,470
Hey.

711
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:08,450
I'll tell you as an employee.

712
00:58:08,450 --> 00:58:13,110
From now on, I'll tell boss to bring up your documents.

713
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:21,330
Childish.

714
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:25,490
So childish.
