1
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,100
What are you doing?

2
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,500
I'm being your shade.

3
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,160
I'm fine. Move your hand.

4
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,240
Yes, Ajhussi.

5
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:01,380
I'm at the hospital. The President has fallen ill again.

6
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,920
Okay, I'll go right over.

7
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,820
What's happened?

8
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:09,300
My father has fallen ill again. They said it was nothing to worry about.

9
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,380
What are you doing?

10
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,480
I brought my car to work. I'll give you a ride.

11
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,380
Okay. Let me go.

12
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,000
I don't want to.

13
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,960
Thanks.

14
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,100
It shouldn't be a big deal.

15
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,260
Don't try to look good to me.

16
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,560
I'm not trying. I'm doing what I want to do.

17
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,920
Don't.

18
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,400
How many people do you think actually live doing whatever they want?

19
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,280
Yoon Ha!

20
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,560
Did I tell you I was sorry?

21
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,340
You did.

22
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,640
But why does it feel like I didn't?

23
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,140
We... we wanted each other's lacking backgrounds.

24
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,140
I acknowledge the fact that your background is also who you are.

25
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:13,660
There's no reason why only you should be shamed in our relationship.

26
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:18,860
There's no reason for you to receive the same treatment as I because you put personality first.

27
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,300
No, I placed more value on money.

28
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,560
So, I hid it.

29
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,380
I edited out from my life the time that I loved you.

30
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:35,900
It was the most useless time of my life.

31
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,780
I thought that love could help me deal with reality.

32
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,840
Love does help you deal with reality. I didn't like that, so I didn't want to love.

33
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,860
The reality that I have...

34
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,760
I don't want to deal with it because of love.

35
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,480
How can we be divided on each issue?

36
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,620
It's not easy to not see eye-to-eye like this.

37
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:11,420
There will come a time when we do end up seeing eye-to-eye.

38
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,540
How can we agree once we started to diverge?

39
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,940
High Society
Episode 15

40
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,120
Why aren't you guys going in?

41
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,200
No visitors allowed.

42
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,820
Why is family kept from visiting?

43
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,700
That's what I'm saying.

44
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,400
Is he that bad?

45
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,900
Is he bad or do you think he has another purpose?

46
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,060
What do you mean?

47
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,160
I have to go due to company matters.

48
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,540
Where is mom?

49
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,080
Using this photo, we searched for Gyeong Joon's whereabouts

50
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,480
and are hot on his trail.

51
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,780
We tried to contact him but we were rejected.

52
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,080
Rejected?

53
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,180
It's a Taiwanese firm that denies having any relation to Vice President Jang Gyeong Joon.

54
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,300
Give me his contact information. I'll contact him.

55
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,260
There's no way he would ignore my calls.

56
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,020
He may just use another identity and disappear again.

57
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,880
This is such absurd behavior.

58
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,340
I've never heard of such a thing.

59
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,580
There's no way that he can create this kind of situation without being crazy.

60
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,880
Even if he is crazy, I wish for him to be alive.

61
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,820
But even if he is living somewhere else with a different identity,

62
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,070
he probably knew that the President fainted.

63
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:48,220
He probably does know. He doesn't seem totally disconnected with society,

64
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,440
seeing that he still attends art exhibitions.

65
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,980
Before he went on the trip, he randomly said that he believes in me, his mom,

66
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,100
because she's a strong person.

67
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,780
He might appear if he hears that I fainted.

68
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,640
That's not it. Even if you faint,

69
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:07,900
and are revived, he'll know that it's the same as before and won't make a move.

70
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,160
You can't underestimate him.

71
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,720
The President is with his wife in the room.

72
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,780
There is no danger to his health.

73
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,940
Even if they go to these measures to bring him back, it'll all be for naught.

74
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,020
I know Gyeong Joon. He's not someone to come out because of that.

75
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:37,180
Maybe not voluntarily but he could be forced.

76
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,380
They found his whereabouts.

77
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,980
They found him?

78
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,460
Well, dad is not a person who lets go of something that he bites (doesn't give up).

79
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,720
He eventually found out, huh. He has to come back.

80
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,240
He has to come because he heard the news that the President fainted.

81
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,260
Even if he comes, he'll live being scorned.

82
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:00,760
Dad is not someone who will forgive those who betray him, even if that's his child.

83
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,240
Big Sister.

84
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,980
Get the car ready. I'll be out soon.

85
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,660
Yes.

86
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:14,240
Can you tell me what's going on right now?

87
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,780
I want to drink ice tea. Can you buy it for me?

88
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,740
When did you start dreaming of getting the company, Unni?

89
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,020
Since dad started using me to train Gyeong Joon.

90
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,220
While I was being used, I learned to use.

91
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:47,180
How did you feel when you found out that you were being used by Dad?

92
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,200
Why are you asking that?

93
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,720
I thought everyone except me was happy.

94
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,560
There was always Mom beside you guys.

95
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,180
Do you think children will be happy just being together?

96
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,600
There's room to fight there as well.

97
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,040
Do you think Oppa will return?

98
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:11,800
Or do you think he will hide away further?

99
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,220
I'm not interested. I need to leave now.

100
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:19,680
Unni, my dream is

101
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,860
to live normally after falling in love and getting married.

102
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,760
Good thinking.

103
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,480
Trusting in Father's and Gyeong Joon's discernment, the result I made after dealing with you was...

104
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,040
you are just a girl.

105
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,520
Dad saw you well.

106
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,880
Unni, you are great as a poison to make others grow.

107
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,340
What?

108
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:45,260
Your advice that people grow as they figure out who they are

109
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,540
is right.

110
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,800
I found out how to live as me while being a chaebol daughter.

111
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,620
The place you are in right now,

112
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,380
why you want it so much,

113
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,680
I want to have it as well.

114
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,240
Do you think this spot is easy?

115
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,880
First, to be recognized that I have skills,

116
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,800
what do I need to get it?

117
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,080
Numbers.

118
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,000
Numbers?

119
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,780
Sell a lot of goods. Increase sales by a lot.

120
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,560
Since starting at the company,

121
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,120
I've set and broken all the records for sales.

122
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,240
If we sell makeup that is linked to you, it will have a really good response.

123
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,100
Assistant Manager said it was a good idea, so he said he'd help make a video. Let's record it!

124
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:29,800
What?

125
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,720
A picture of you doing makeup. A commoner and chaebol's daughter.

126
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,260
Yes, Yoon Ha.

127
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:45,520
Yeah, how is the SNS, that you were gonna post of you and me, coming along?

128
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,480
Assistant Manager Choi- no, Team Leader Choi said he'd make it.

129
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,620
A video is more effective than a photo.

130
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,900
I understand. I'll check up with Joon Gi.

131
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,540
Okay.

132
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,220
See me for a moment. In my room.

133
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,560
What's going on?

134
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,380
This... do you remember when I first brought you here?

135
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,920
I remember.

136
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,760
You told me to start here and keep going up.

137
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:39,300
You said your goal is not a position.

138
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:44,520
From now on, I want to live in my reality.

139
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,000
I want to start here and go up.

140
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,820
I don't know much since it hasn't been long since I've been involved in a corporation.

141
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,680
As a team leader, if I were to choose between human trust and competency-

142
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:06,300
Competency. In a corporation, being too kind and incompetent is really a nuisance.

143
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,960
Help me.

144
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,620
I'll help you.

145
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,440
When are you going to give me the video?

146
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,080
I'll give it to you when my junior gives it to me. Since you're doing it, do it forcefully. Do you use SNS?

147
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,920
No.

148
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,720
Make one. Use it for your own media.

149
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,240
You have a lot of potential.

150
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,140
I know. An innocent chaebol's daughter

151
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,880
that is dating a commoner.

152
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,620
I'll use it well.

153
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,400
But will you be okay?

154
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,220
It will be hard for you if you're linked to me.

155
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,270
Ye Won Unnie won't like it.

156
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:44,750
You work under a person, but you aren't controlled by a person.

157
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:50,570
Hunting dogs get eaten after hunting season. If that's the logic of a superior,

158
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:56,210
then the subordinate has the choice to not give the quarry.

159
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:59,520
I can make a deal with the quarry. It's not bad

160
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,730
living as a subordinate.

161
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,250
What are you doing?
- Working out.

162
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,040
After working out what will you do?
- Office.

163
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,110
You can only give answers like that? So frustrating...

164
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:33,970
Why?
- No...

165
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:36,690
Mom wants to make you happy.

166
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,170
Later.
- What later?

167
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,330
Anyway, everything later.

168
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:44,840
Aren't you being too cold to me lately?

169
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:50,290
Mom, you have three sons.
- Okay, I got it, I did wrong.

170
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:59,310
His temper, really! He's taking after that.

171
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:05,730
Once you find out what kind of decision I made for you, you'll be shocked.

172
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,910
Good morning.

173
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,870
Right.

174
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,030
It's been a long time.

175
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,950
Would you like to order?

176
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,610
Are you farsighted?

177
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,720
Ice tea.

178
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,340
Me, too.
- Yes.

179
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:41,560
How can you say those kind of things out loud?
- Oh, I'm sorry!

180
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,850
But can I ask you a personal question?

181
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:48,030
Can I ask you how old you are?
- Why that?

182
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:53,190
Don't you have like a secret.

183
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,170
He looked pretty old.

184
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:59,630
I just couldn't with you-

185
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,470
No...

186
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:04,730
I gave birth to them all.

187
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:08,530
You could just say that I look really young,

188
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:12,530
why do you ask around?
- It's not even that you look a little young,

189
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:16,870
if you're next to me, it's as if we can be called sisters.

190
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,350
Sure.

191
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:24,230
The reason why I asked you to meet me today was...
- I don't meet the director anymore.

192
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,830
You can be relieved.

193
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:30,360
You can meet our Chang Soo.

194
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,790
What?

195
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,840
You can meet Chang Soo.

196
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,440
Why aren't you saying anything?

197
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:49,930
Why are you crying?

198
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:55,090
Well, it is something to cry about. I'm saying that you can meet each other. I didn't approve of the marriage.

199
00:13:55,090 --> 00:14:00,450
Because I stopped him, Chang Soo seemed like his heart was breaking for you, so I'm being like this.

200
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:07,470
Thank you, Mother.
- You must be thankful for sure.

201
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,390
I like that you are a good person.

202
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,500
Thank you for that.

203
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,960
What does that mean?

204
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,740
Every time I met up with you I said I liked it.

205
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,950
It was a lie.
- I knew that.

206
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:24,830
Who would like someone that doesn't like them back?

207
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:29,050
I knew it.
- But you were a nice person as expected.

208
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:32,450
I like the fact that you are a good person.

209
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:36,490
I am normally a rational and sweet person.

210
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:40,870
I'm not being like this to you because I want to.
- But Mother...

211
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:45,690
I won't meet the Director.

212
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,000
Why?
- We broke up.

213
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,990
How can I meet him again after breaking up? I really can't.

214
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,770
Your opposed to our marriage.

215
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:01,500
Like I've told you before, I won't marry a man whose household opposes our marriage.

216
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,870
So when that time comes, we would have to break up again.

217
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:08,510
Did Chang Soo just get rejected?

218
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:13,290
To you?
- You said this the first time.

219
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:18,430
If it's real love, step aside for the opponent.

220
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:23,200
So I'm stepping aside. Meeting a woman with a similar background,

221
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:29,670
not feeling inferior from his brothers, having a good relationship with his parents for the rest of his life, I wish these for him.

222
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:45,010
I left the USB on the table. It's the video for you to put up on SNS.

223
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,270
Thank you.

224
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:50,070
If you get stuck while working, tell me. I'll do whatever I can do.

225
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:54,510
You are including a condition of "doing whatever you can". What if I ask of something you can't do?

226
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:58,810
If you know that is something I can't do then why would you ask me to do it?

227
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:01,840
If it's something that can't be done, then don't ask for it.

228
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,250
Criticizing me again.

229
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:07,590
If I do what I can't do, are you going to think I love you that much?

230
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,710
It seems like you have a habit of turning sincerity to humiliation.

231
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:13,390
I have to work.
- You are changing the topic because it's to your disadvantage.

232
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:17,930
But do you know that your habit of pointing stuff out is too severe?

233
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,430
I know. I'm doing that to garner attention.

234
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:22,710
What are you going to do by garnering attention?

235
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:28,650
I'm not trying to start anything. It feels good to plainly talk.

236
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,950
Why?

237
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:37,130
The first time I met you, I liked this, too.

238
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,570
I will go.

239
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,670
What's wrong?

240
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,770
I met Ji Yi.

241
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:18,670
But she's very funny.

242
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:22,790
Why?
- I gave her permission for you guys to meet.

243
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:26,370
What does that mean?
- You're so miserable.

244
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:32,790
By attempting to block it, it seems like I'm adding fuel to the fire. So while it's on fire, I can just burn out the flame.

245
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:35,310
I told her she can meet you.

246
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,790
She said no.

247
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:42,180
She said she won't marry a man whose household opposes the marriage. She said this last time.

248
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,630
Mom.

249
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:48,210
She's said she's backing off for your happiness.

250
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,510
Let's talk.
- Go.

251
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,970
Mom, don't be involved with my marriage matters anymore.

252
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:04,500
Why?
- It hurts my pride so much that I can't forgive myself anymore.

253
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,350
What do you mean by that?
- I don't want to remain as the neighborhood idiot that doesn't think for himself.

254
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:13,870
Starting with Joon Gi, being swept away by a tsunami, I was out of my mind.

255
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:17,410
Why did you have your guard up towards Joon Gi? I told you that he was my friend.

256
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:19,870
It's because I Iived for so long in this world.

257
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:24,910
Joon Gi's mother treated me well without any boundaries. Did she not live long?

258
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:28,610
Because we have so much, were you guarded because it might be taken away?

259
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:31,480
If you don't trust your friends, who can you trust in this world and live.

260
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,930
Are you teaching your mom?

261
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:37,370
How can I teach you?

262
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:40,690
You are the best mom to me.

263
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:45,170
Mom, living for a long time and living in a good way is different.

264
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:49,910
Mom, trust me. Support me in whatever decision I make.

265
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:52,880
What decision are you going to make?
- Even if you don't like it...

266
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,650
I don't like that.
- Do it even if you hate it.

267
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:59,630
I did whatever you wanted me to do even when I hated it, because you are my mom.

268
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:04,410
"To us, we have three sons."
Ha! Isn't this a bit too much?

269
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:08,720
For me mom, you are the only one.
- Sorry.

270
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,510
Whose mom are you?

271
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:15,110
Chang Soo's.
- Please listen to me.

272
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:22,780
You're getting old and I'm maturing bit-by-bit. As a result, I'll become your guardian.

273
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:40,540
Due to Tae Jin group's President Jang Won Shik falling ill only a month after his first collapse due to myocardial infarction,

274
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:46,340
the issue is watching to see if Vice President Jang Ye Won can take President Jang Won Shik's absence

275
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,910
as an opportunity to prove her leadership.

276
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,590
[Vice President Jang Ye Won]

277
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:53,710
You have a meeting at 3 PM with Big Super Mall Global's sales team.

278
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:59,630
Father would be surprised to find out that Tae Jin Premium has entered Big Super Mall's Korean pavilion.

279
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,130
Because I'm doing much better than he thought.

280
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:05,550
You might be able to get three times the amount of current profit from China.

281
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:09,210
Did she get our products in Gang Hui Plaza?

282
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,510
It's not easy. More.

283
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,910
It seems like Vice President Jang Gyeong Joon won't be making an appearance.

284
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,750
Until now he hasn't called.

285
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:22,230
He thought well. If he said he was going to live a new life, he should.

286
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,550
Who was my lunch appointment?

287
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,780
Have you been well?

288
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,230
I have nothing to say.

289
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,570
How is father?

290
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:49,480
You'll see when you get there.

291
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,460
For VP Jang, we'll say that he had temporary memory loss

292
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,080
but regained his memory and came home.

293
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,290
Let's go to the company.

294
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,790
Yes, President.

295
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,470
I'm back.

296
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:46,120
Was your vacation good?

297
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,640
Yes. It was very good.

298
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,800
Is that it?

299
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,780
That's it.

300
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,320
I understand.

301
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:33,100
Why are you following me in? You said you had nothing to say to me.

302
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,600
What can I say to you right now?

303
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,970
You know? You did something that cannot be excused.

304
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:40,920
I know.

305
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,880
I can't understand.

306
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,760
Even if I try to understand, I can't.

307
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,930
How can you do this to me? I did so much for you,

308
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:53,180
and you were such a special son to me.

309
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:57,620
My whole life depended on you, but how could you do this to me?

310
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,850
I'm sorry that my life

311
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,380
came before yours.

312
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:06,470
Just because your life is important,

313
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:10,290
you stabbed a knife into the heart of your mom who only looked to you?

314
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:14,890
Mom, let's be honest with ourselves.

315
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:19,780
No matter how much a parent loves their child, they do not love them as much as they love themselves.

316
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:24,890
I also know as a parent. The reason why you risked your life for me,

317
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:27,930
it was for your sake.

318
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,720
Dad and I

319
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,340
don't have the same philosophy of business management,

320
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:39,520
but there was no choice I could make.

321
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,060
I was born and raised as an heir.

322
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,430
Unless I was reborn,

323
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:49,530
I knew that I could not get out of here.

324
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,630
Mom.

325
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:59,490
I think I lived wrong.

326
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:03,680
Gyeong Joon, I lived my life wrong.

327
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,040
I think I lived wrong.

328
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:10,960
I loved you... more than I did my husband.

329
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,650
I thought I was at least... making you happy.

330
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:21,200
Even if my life was messed up, I thought it would be fine as long as you were happy.

331
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,400
But what is this?

332
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,290
What is this?

333
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:34,420
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

334
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,960
I should have lived for my life.

335
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,780
I should have not lived for you.

336
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:03,700
I brought this one after fixing it from last time.

337
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:07,630
I understand. I'll go over it.

338
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:11,320
How is the health of the President?

339
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,670
He's fine.

340
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:15,620
What's happened that he fainted again?

341
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:19,420
You said that the last one was nothing serious.

342
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:22,870
There's no exact diagnosis on his illness, either.

343
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,980
Then I'll be leaving now.

344
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:30,960
No, why do you cut me off? I'm not done talking.

345
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:43,560
Ugh! Ahjumma!

346
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:52,990
How can you act so kind?

347
00:25:55,290 --> 00:26:00,430
Ahjumma, sit. I have something to say.

348
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:14,260
I think I should tidy my lifestyle.

349
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:20,400
The President's health is wavering and his wife will come out even stronger.

350
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,930
If his health is going up and down, it's hard to be strong.

351
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:30,350
So he'll listen to his wife.

352
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,910
Good thinking.

353
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:37,220
You won't have your job anymore, did you think about it well?

354
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,580
I have somewhere else I can work at.

355
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:47,370
I think I need to put my house down and leave.

356
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:52,370
Yes, you're still young. Have a fresh start.

357
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:55,860
You're still at an age where you can get married.

358
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:58,950
You know my age?

359
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,950
I'm not sure, but through instinct...

360
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:08,640
How much through instinct?

361
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,990
About 50?

362
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:14,850
Ahjumma! I'm in my 40's!

363
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:19,080
I knew you were in your 40's. I just called higher.

364
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,490
You have to call higher.

365
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,080
I don't know.

366
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,700
Ahjumma, you can't be like this.

367
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,490
Don't give up. Keep explaining.

368
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:37,970
Why did you stop halfway? This is really important to me.

369
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:41,620
I really don't want to look like I'm 50!

370
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,500
Try cutting your hair.

371
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:49,060
Then, I think you might look younger.

372
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:52,240
Ahjumma! Ugh!

373
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,410
Hair?

374
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,320
It's my main feature.

375
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,080
I came to you first before going to father.

376
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,690
There's no other entertainment (better than this).

377
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:33,960
This spot... you're sitting in it.

378
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,480
The spot found its original owner.

379
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,710
What are you going to do now that you've been caught after running away?

380
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:42,640
Tell me if you want to run away again. I'll help you.

381
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:48,320
I never ran away. I chose another life and now again I choose life as Jang Gyeong Joon.

382
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,610
You have no desire to win.

383
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:54,290
You've never earned anything by winning.

384
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:57,670
I met you too early.

385
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:00,320
You're the same as before I left.

386
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,080
What did you expect from Yoon Ha?

387
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,200
You gave stocks to a kid who doesn't know anything

388
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,400
and even a USB.

389
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,690
She's not someone who doesn't know anything.

390
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,350
I thought perhaps and I competed against her, but

391
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:19,290
it was really insulting for me.

392
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:25,610
You only see what comes to your eyes, older sister.

393
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,110
How's the process on Taejin products entering Big Super Mall?

394
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,990
How do you know that?

395
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,660
I know more than you think I know

396
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,640
and I'll do more.

397
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:52,680
How's entering Big Super Mall going?

398
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:57,900
We're in the process of modifying the detailed contract with the person in charge of Asia from their holding company.

399
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,410
Make it happen, no matter what.

400
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,580
I understand.

401
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:04,180
The group's future is on you.

402
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:10,710
I will lead the group, following your wishes.

403
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,980
I met Gyeong Joon.

404
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,210
Who is Gyeong Joon?

405
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:20,320
He came to my room.

406
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,290
He will come see you soon.

407
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:25,460
I will see the rest at home.

408
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,190
I have the car ready.

409
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,680
Excuse me.

410
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:39,770
Where is Team Leader Jang Yoon Ha's office?

411
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,990
Follow me.

412
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,570
You don't need to go that far.

413
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:50,290
Since it's only turning a little bit from my intended destination, you don't need to be too burdened by it.

414
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,200
It's right over here.

415
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,540
What department do you work at?

416
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,680
I am the American Money Management Team Leader, Choi Joon Gi.

417
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,520
It seems like it hasn't been long since you've joined the company.

418
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,640
Yes, I'm a career employee.

419
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,720
I'm Jang Gyeong Joon.

420
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:17,390
Aren't you perhaps Yoon Ha's boyfriend?

421
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:21,450
The one who worked at Yoo Min Department Store. I saw it through a news article.

422
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,450
Not right now.

423
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,680
I see.

424
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,470
Right now, the number of people who liked the post is not a joke.

425
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:38,840
We also got a lot of likes and it's just increasing.
- Yay!

426
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,810
I wish this would become big! The company is difficult, so it'd be nice for this to explode.

427
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:45,130
I know. I hope it's a huge success.

428
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,400
Oh, it's a number that I don't know.

429
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,000
Yes, hello.

430
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,420
Yes, I am Jang Yoon Ha.

431
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:58,850
Ah, well... I have never thought about that.

432
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:02,330
Yes, I understand. I will optimistically consider it.

433
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:04,710
What is it?

434
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:07,550
Do you know about a program called "Beauty & Beauty"?

435
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,140
I know! I watch that program really well.

436
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:14,200
They teach makeup techniques, introduce new makeup products and help you to maintain your beauty.

437
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,060
They asked me to make an appearance on their show.

438
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,720
Really?! Wow, that's great!

439
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,710
That's something great?

440
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:23,430
That is great! Make an appearance! You can advertise for free, it's good.

441
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:27,710
Even a chaebol daughter should interact with the public rather than being locked up in her castle.

442
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,990
Moreover, I think that a lot of makeup will sell.

443
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:33,510
If it's guaranteed that a lot of makeup will sell, then I'll do anything.

444
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,540
Have a seat.

445
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,900
Do you want to drink tea?

446
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,900
No, it's fine.

447
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,600
How is the entry into Gang Hui department store?

448
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,470
Not yet...

449
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,150
Team Leader Choi Joon Gi and you entered the company at a similar time.

450
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:03,570
While he settled a contract with 3 American department stores, what have you been doing?

451
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:10,770
I understand your desire, but I still think that it's a strain to place you as a team leader.

452
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:15,010
If you don't show me your progress through numbers in one month, let's reconsider your position.

453
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:17,490
Father appointed me here. You are overstepping his authority.

454
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:21,700
The situation then-and-now is different. I'm the Vice President.

455
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,970
I can appoint team leaders by my own power.

456
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:30,150
If you are going to go whining to father, then nothing can be done.

457
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:34,260
I am going to visit him. That's a behavior that suits my identity.

458
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:38,420
Even though the two of us are different in positions at work, personally we're the same.

459
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:44,160
If I can't work, then I'll have to take responsibility for that but let's not steal each others' plates as well.

460
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,260
You are better than expected. You've improved in a short time.

461
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,600
It's because of you.

462
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,690
So, I can fire Choi Joon Gi, right?

463
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,150
It's my call, right?

464
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,040
It is your call.

465
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:02,050
But Unnie, if you fire people without any justification, won't it damage your leadership?

466
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:04,550
Any damage... can be recovered.

467
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,630
Do whatever you like.

468
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:14,070
But you see, Unnie... I can take and use the person that you fire, right?

469
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:19,190
I'll go out. I'm too busy.

470
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:33,400
While you were at Yoo Min Department Store, did you ever work with Chinese department stores, airports, or in connection to the department store in Shanghai?

471
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:37,580
I have a lot of interests regarding work so I know a lot of people and network with them.

472
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,560
How are you with Yoon Ha?

473
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,860
I don't understand what you are trying to say...

474
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,920
Are you two still meeting?

475
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,840
No.

476
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,880
You thought well.

477
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,480
Our household won't accept you.

478
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,260
I usually don't care about background and just look at a person's ability.

479
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,860
I'm thankful that you put merit first.

480
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:04,700
It seems like the lifestyle that Yoon Ha wants... is to get married and have children.

481
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:08,320
But she is now living the life that she does not want to live.

482
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:14,180
Because of the stocks that Gyeong Joon left in her name, her existence at the company has been magnified.

483
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:19,400
As an older sister, I want her to live the life she wants.

484
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,140
If you even had a little bit of love for Yoon Ha,

485
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:26,080
I hope that you would cooperate with my plan.

486
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,040
I don't really understand what you're trying to say.

487
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:34,760
The China Money Management team is a newly created team after Yoon Ha stepped in.

488
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,820
And I want to combine that with the American Money Management team.

489
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:44,500
I thoroughly protect my person, my line.

490
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:48,100
Of course, it's when their loyalty towards me is strong.

491
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:51,820
You make it happen with China.

492
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:57,070
What if I reject it?

493
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,330
Then you need to find another job.

494
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:05,890
I hate dragging emotions.

495
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:16,780
Tell Team Leader Choi Joon Gi to come in.

496
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:21,680
Oh, that Jang Yoon Ha article... combine and release it with the makeup article that appeared on the SNS.

497
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,910
Use another worker.

498
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:29,440
Ah, don't connect it with me. Just think about the number of sources that I have relayed to you.

499
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,100
Okay, I'll ask if she can do the interview.

500
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,780
Alright.

501
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:41,250
You are doing well, right?

502
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:54,100
Chong Soo Daily Report wants an interview with you. Do you want to do it?

503
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,300
I want to do it because Chong Soo Daily Report is an economic newspaper company.

504
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,640
Okay, just tell me when you're available.

505
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:03,840
I decided to make an appearance on TV. It's a female beauty channel.

506
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,120
You did well.

507
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,880
I did well?
- Yes.

508
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,460
Recovering your weakness, I see it as an appeal to the public.

509
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,460
What is the weakness that I possess?

510
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:16,740
Your support system is weak and you're the last one to start.

511
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:20,190
Look at your text message.

512
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:25,570
I miss you.

513
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,480
It's my father saying that he misses me.

514
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,260
Is that your technique?

515
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,180
No.

516
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:41,500
Even after being insulted, having no choice but to be beggarly in front of his child and being able to endure the distress.

517
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,200
I need to have that kind of endurance, right?

518
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,100
What do you mean?

519
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:49,930
The road to moving upward. I fought with my older sister again.

520
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:54,930
My principle is not to get involved in fights of higher ranking people.

521
00:37:54,930 --> 00:38:01,370
During war, I should make at least one person on my side. Won't you be on my side?

522
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:03,180
You have become a fighter already.

523
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,680
Because I want to win.

524
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,020
Why aren't you answering? You're not going to stay on my side?

525
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:14,780
Your brother came. I lead him to your office.

526
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,900
Ah, really?

527
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,820
Didn't you perhaps get hit by my brother?

528
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,420
No, I didn't get hit.

529
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,360
You will get hit one day.

530
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:27,400
Chang Soo got hit after creating a ruckus towards me. If you see my brother, avoid him.

531
00:38:56,190 --> 00:39:01,030
I'm leaving after much waiting. I need to see father first. See you at home.

532
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,730
Father...

533
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:28,110
Yes, I should at least see you once.

534
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:42,230
Did you think that you could dare to live after creating this kind of mess?

535
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:44,450
I can live.

536
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:49,930
Father, you and I differ in the way that we want to live life and do business.

537
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:52,390
Do you think that there's anything that you can do by yourself?

538
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:56,370
Ever since college, I invested in several potential companies besides our own.

539
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:59,300
Do you want to go into Big Supermarket?

540
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:03,190
I have holdings in Jiju Albimama.

541
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:10,030
Even if it's not the empire that you've created, I've suffered hardships trying to obtain my dream.

542
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:12,910
Give up your house and leave!

543
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:16,850
If you wanted to do that, you shouldn't have called me out.

544
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:19,500
Now, I am going to work according to my goals and my direction.

545
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,100
Do you think you're going to win over me?

546
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:27,190
I didn't think time was on my side.

547
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:31,630
But you're a human as well and nothing in the face of time.

548
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:36,490
If I had known that before, then I wouldn't have found a new identity.

549
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:44,080
I'm going to burn all of the things I was going to leave to you and take it with me when I die.

550
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:51,230
From now on, between you and me, a new war begins.

551
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:57,100
I promise it won't be like before.

552
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,820
Really?

553
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:06,050
Let's see then. If you can take my era and make it yours.

554
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,650
Why are you quiet? I think I've given you more than enough time.

555
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,170
Do you not understand what I said?

556
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:30,240
I understand.

557
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:34,190
I think that Yoon Ha can't enter Gang Hui department store because of you. Is that right?

558
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:39,850
No. I haven't reached out to the Chinese markets yet.

559
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:45,350
I told you to absorb the Chinese team.

560
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:49,400
Jang Yoon Ha isn't someone who is going to be a threat to you.

561
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,260
Are you telling me that you know my younger sister more than I do?

562
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:57,980
Or... do you still like Yoon Ha?

563
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:06,220
Love is also about timing. If you try to correct something that's off course, it'll just veer off even more.

564
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,490
I'll give you more time.

565
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:13,250
I like you, Team Leader Choi.

566
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:18,660
This time, more than Yoon Ha, this is my test for you.

567
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:22,550
Tests exist for you to get a 100.

568
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:50,180
I'll go during the weekend, Dad.

569
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:19,600
Let's see each other.

570
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:30,240
Why?

571
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:39,200
I have something to say. I shall say it face-to-face. Because I don't have jerk manners.

572
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:10,950
It's been a long time.

573
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,000
It's been a long time.

574
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,510
Put on your seat belt.

575
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:19,200
Are we going somewhere?

576
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,980
Shouldn't we eat first?

577
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:26,700
Then it'll be longer. Just say it so we can go our separate ways.

578
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:30,470
You've changed since I last saw you.

579
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:31,720
Me, what?

580
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:38,040
Do you only think about yourself? If we meet around a meal time, then you should think about the other person as well. I'm hungry.

581
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:43,150
I got it. Let's eat then.

582
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:44,090
What do you want to eat?

583
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:46,010
Something good.

584
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:52,890
This looks good!

585
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:54,090
Is this good?

586
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:55,520
This is good, eat it.

587
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,170
I'm not eating it.

588
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:59,130
If you're not eating, then... oh well.

589
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:03,650
Eat the rice balls then.

590
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:06,160
There's nothing that matches my taste.

591
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:11,400
I know, right. There's nothing that matches. For sure, it's comfortable living with people who are similar.

592
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:15,690
I met your mother.

593
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:19,350
I know. Even what you both discussed.

594
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:26,230
When we dated, I let you deal with my mom alone because I couldn't control her.

595
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:29,850
I told her I understood.

596
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:36,450
I've never moved before. I don't even know how to do it.

597
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:40,420
Don't move. Moving isn't something you should abruptly do.

598
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:43,250
Once you get a house by mistake, it'll be troublesome until you come out.

599
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:49,190
Then you move. You've moved a lot before, so you're used to it. Move to my neighborhood.

600
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:53,320
That neighborhood isn't a place where I could move with my own ability. It's too expensive.

601
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:00,010
I've thought a lot after we broke up.

602
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:06,570
There are things where I don't have to explain things to Assistant Manager Choi. When you're with Yoon Ha, you're comfortable.

603
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:12,840
My mom said this. It's nice to marry with comfortable people. Like with like.

604
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:16,380
Everyone lives like that. Let's live like that, too.

605
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:17,100
Ji Yi.

606
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:24,140
What happened to the frog and the scorpion when they cross the river together? They die.

607
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:30,960
Let's live. Let's live missing each other. Let's live.

608
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,540
Let's live and not choose to kill each other.

609
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:44,770
It's chicken legs with soju.
Ahjumma, give us soju, please!

610
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:56,090
♫ I’m also pushing you away like this ♫

611
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:05,560
♫ Please stop coming close to me ♫

612
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:13,170
♫ Because your warmth will surely shake me up ♫

613
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:20,930
♫ As much as I am holding back from you ♫

614
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:30,260
♫ It may hurt but I have to hold back from you ♫

615
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,210
Well then, bye.

616
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:34,530
I'll drop you off.

617
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:36,180
Don't try to be around me.

618
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:40,350
Are you serious? When did I do that?

619
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:45,020
Don't give me hope.

620
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:47,550
You must be so excited now that you broke up with me.

621
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:49,570
Because I'm a full-time employee.

622
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:55,860
I'm not doing this for my own benefit. How long do you think love will go? It's just hormones.

623
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:57,740
The expiration period is 3 years.

624
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:00,370
So you really did like me.

625
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:03,580
Then did I pretend to like you?

626
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:11,050
It's like I'm looking at my old self. Like a doppelganger. I used to live like this.

627
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:14,520
You should have gotten the good things from me. Why did you get the player aspects?

628
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:17,410
I guess that fit me the best.

629
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,340
Really...

630
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:34,210
Yeah.

631
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:35,390
What are you doing?

632
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:39,740
I'm watching a video. I want to see how others do it, since I'm making a TV appearance.

633
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:43,510
You.... fire Ji Yi.

634
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:44,590
Why should I fire her?

635
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:49,680
She has no interest in men or love since becoming a full-time employee.

636
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,000
Now she seems to care about gathering money.

637
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,750
They say the thing that's the most useless about caring about other people is caring about others' love lives.

638
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:11,620
You're leaving now?

639
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:13,020
You didn't leave yet.

640
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:15,230
I have to look at something.

641
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:17,560
This is what the party in China sent over.

642
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:21,670
Thanks. You have a lot of connections in China.

643
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:27,480
It's not my connections but it's because the Taejin reputation and sales are good.

644
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:30,990
I wish we could get into the department stores in Shanghai and Gang Hui.

645
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:35,120
It turns out I know someone at Gang Hui. I'll look into it.

646
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:41,110
You are on my side, Joon Gi. You didn't respond earlier. Are you showing me through giving this?

647
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:42,850
Do you like it?

648
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:45,640
I like it. See you tomorrow.

649
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:50,310
Jang Yoon Ha!

650
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:51,850
Yeah?

651
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:56,600
Win.

652
00:49:57,390 --> 00:49:59,360
I will win.

653
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:16,240
♫ The more I look at you, you keep... ♫

654
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:21,580
You always leave before me and arrive after me.

655
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:28,010
What's wrong?

656
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:32,730
You're not possibly...

657
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:34,440
drunk, are you?

658
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,300
That's right.

659
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:40,050
How much (did you drink)?

660
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:42,710
One bottle of soju.

661
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:45,310
One bottle...
- No,

662
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:47,380
one and a half.

663
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:53,010
I got it.

664
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:55,610
Are you just going to leave?

665
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:58,610
Sorry, I wrongly chose my timing.

666
00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:01,310
I don't like your drunk habits. Let's talk later.

667
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:02,630
This isn't right.

668
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:06,210
No, this is right.
- I only drank one bottle.

669
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,780
I'll tell you one funny story.

670
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:19,090
It's a really sad story.

671
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:22,450
The scorpion was crossing a river.

672
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:24,970
A frog was there.

673
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:27,410
You're right about you drinking one bottle.

674
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:29,200
That's right.

675
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:41,430
I have something else to say.

676
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:45,190
It's not something to say to a drunk person.

677
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:47,650
Do it. Please do it.

678
00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:50,610
I don't want to.
- You have to today.

679
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:53,590
Because we're not going to meet again.

680
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:55,830
Why are you like this?

681
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:58,850
You say no, even though my mom let us date.

682
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:02,650
We met and I told you why I let you and my mom meet.

683
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:05,350
And even though I beat around the bush, I told you I didn't want to move into your neighborhood.

684
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:08,270
I told you not to move.

685
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:10,530
I'm not going to do a marriage where the boy's family doesn't accept me.

686
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:13,820
Can you live without me?
- I can do it.

687
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:16,670
Ji Yi...

688
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:19,490
I'm not going to love again.

689
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:21,840
I'm going to die alone after growing old.

690
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:26,630
I, at least, will have a house when I die because I will work hard to earn money.

691
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:29,330
Why are you like this?

692
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:32,910
Do you know what kind of decision I made so that I can be with you?

693
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:34,810
What kind of plans I made?

694
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:40,390
Even so, you're going to work hard and then say sorry and break up.

695
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:45,710
Did you get hurt?

696
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:51,310
Yes.
- I said it for you to be hurt.

697
00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:55,390
I'm like this. My heart is like this nowadays.

698
00:52:55,390 --> 00:52:58,430
They say the heart is a skill, but

699
00:52:58,430 --> 00:53:01,230
my skill is lacking.

700
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:07,830
I don't want us to break up again.

701
00:53:07,830 --> 00:53:10,210
I can't date and break up again.

702
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:12,800
We are not going to break up again.

703
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:17,440
No, how do you know her mind is not going to change again? Money doesn't change.

704
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:21,350
Did I make you like this?

705
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:25,310
Did you become like this because you loved me?

706
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:34,270
I love you.

707
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:45,930
I'm drunk.

708
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:48,630
I'm going to forget everything that's been said today.

709
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:52,950
I'm going to erase my memories from now on.

710
00:53:52,950 --> 00:54:01,870
♫ What should I do? What can I do? ♫

711
00:54:01,870 --> 00:54:09,170
♫ Is this all we are? ♫

712
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:17,610

713
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:24,640

Beauty & Beauty.

718
00:54:57,070 --> 00:55:01,830
Today, as promised, we have a very special guest.

719
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:05,090
Please introduce yourself.

720
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:10,140
Hello. I'm Jang Yoon Ha and I'm in charge of the China team at Taejin Group.

721
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:13,060
Your intro was too formal.

722
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:16,410
It's because I'm nervous. I guess the lights are blinding me a little.

723
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:19,660
Oh, she's so cute. Let's speak comfortably.

724
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:21,810
Yes!

725
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:27,900
Oh, I was a little... It's my first time seeing a chaebol daughter.

726
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:36,300
Where did you meet a guy like him?

727
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:41,730
And you're so popular on social media right now for your makeup.

728
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:44,190
Did you do your own makeup?
- Yes.

729
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:46,950
I only use our cosmetics.

730
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:50,010
Oh, you can't advertise so blatantly.

731
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:55,150
I didn't tell you the names of the products. Just that I'm the team lead for Taejin Pacific.

732
00:55:56,890 --> 00:55:58,230
Resignation Letter

733
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,220
Were you worth only this much?

734
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:06,960
I won't forget that you looked at my merit first.

735
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,570
There are people who must lose everything to learn something.

736
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:12,570
It was a good opportunity.

737
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,360
I respect your decision.

738
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:21,230
I don't think that you can lose everything in life.

739
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:26,010
I'm trying to not think of work as everything.

740
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:30,130
You must still like Yoon Ha.

741
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:35,330
You're giving up your position for something that could be nothing the moment you guys break up?

742
00:56:35,330 --> 00:56:39,620
I, too, as I give it up,

743
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:43,230
am surprised that I am not anxious at all.

744
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:49,790
The things that we thought were negligible seem to be stronger than I thought.

745
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:54,970
Even though it was a short period of time, I've wrapped everything up and thought it would be more of a burden to stay,

746
00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:57,280
so I will leave as of today.

747
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:31,730
Yoon Ha!

748
00:57:31,730 --> 00:57:35,630
This is the sales report for this past month. After you went on broadcast, sales went up by a lot!

749
00:57:35,630 --> 00:57:39,350
I received this and the customer satisfaction reports from the marketing team.

750
00:57:39,350 --> 00:57:42,950
Wow!
- Where are you going?

751
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:49,480
I got the Gang Hui deal. Since I went on the broadcast for social media, there are a lot of foreign companies that want to meet with me.

752
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,550
Congratulations!
- Thanks!

753
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:56,830
I'll go to my sister first.
And today, your favorite chicken feet and soju.

754
00:57:56,830 --> 00:57:58,430
I'll see you later.

755
00:58:03,470 --> 00:58:07,920
Sister, they're numbers. The ones that I've made ever since I came into the company.

756
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,110
I compared my results with yours when you entered the company,

757
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:14,650
I was higher. Now will you acknowledge?

758
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:18,710
Choi Joon Gi turned in his resignation letter.

759
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:23,770
If it was something solely from your ability, I would've acknowledged.

760
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:25,750
What do you mean by that?

761
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:30,450
I'm not kind. You think about it.

762
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:32,170
Leave.

763
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:56,840
Excuse me, did Team Leader Choi go somewhere?

764
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:59,190
He quit.

765
00:59:18,810 --> 00:59:24,590
♫ Please stop coming close to me ♫

766
00:59:26,590 --> 00:59:31,690
