1
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,860
Why are you outside?

2
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,580
What?

3
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,650
Let's talk later.

4
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:49,910
It doesn't simply fall into place...

5
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:54,090
I need to reorganize my thoughts.

6
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,180
If I go home now, there will be homework waiting for me.

7
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,880
Oh, you came? Yoon Ha bought this. She said she bought it to give to me.

8
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,600
I want you to see it, too.

9
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,140
Did something happen?

10
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,950
No!

11
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:29,270
She suddenly fell into a daze and she left saying that something urgent came up.

12
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:33,710
Why is this here?

13
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:37,150
I also cleaned your drawers.

14
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:45,330
As I was organizing it, I saw Yoon Ha's photo.

15
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,710
What's wrong with those two today?

16
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,950
If you're thinking of marriage, you need to think carefully.

17
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,610
He's a man who uses women to save his own household.

18
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:11,090
Do you think that Joon Gi really likes you?

19
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:16,850
What if Joon Gi approached you with an ulterior motive? What would you do?

20
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,000
Director Yoon

21
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,990
The number you have dialed is currently unavailable...

22
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,820
No matter what, I don't understand.

23
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:10,400
The one thing I'm sure of is that even though you knew from the beginning about who's household I was from, you pretended not to. Am I right?

24
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,900
That's right.

25
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,100
What happened with this?

26
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,580
It's a collection item.

27
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:24,140
My initials are written on it. It's mine.

28
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,340
From what I remember, I lost it when I had an arranged date with Chang Soo.

29
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,980
I was too preoccupied.

30
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,520
I picked it up, coincidentally.

31
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,500
By coincidence?

32
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,020
Yeah, coincidence.

33
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,420
Fine.

34
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,720
Then when we first met,

35
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,580
when you passed by as you glanced at me, did you know who I was?

36
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,700
I knew your face.

37
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,620
How?

38
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,110
I saw you in the hotel's elevator.

39
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,820
When you were going up and then down.

40
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,640
I saw you three times that day.

41
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,900
The last time was when we first met.

42
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,140
Fine.

43
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,620
Then... when did you search for these?

44
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,060
Chang Soo asked for it before going to the arranged date with you. Your information.

45
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:31,400
Then after looking at this, did you recognize me in the elevator?

46
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,100
I already told you that. I only knew your face.

47
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,880
I'm in a position where I can get mad.

48
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,060
Even if I ask the same thing, you have to answer in a friendly matter.

49
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:50,080
Fine. When I saw you in the elevator, you looked strange.

50
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,160
When you went up and down.Your make up and your actions.

51
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:01,080
Ah, that's why you told me get control of my temper?

52
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,040
That's right.

53
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:07,240
Then when did you knew that I was Taejin Group's daughter?

54
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,400
When Chang Soo recognized you at the market.

55
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,200
Hey!

56
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,520
That's when I made the connection.

57
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,850
"That's Jang Yoon Ha... of Taejin Group."

58
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,700
So that's it.

59
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:46,880
So you must have known when I talked to you trying to hook you up with Ji Yi...

60
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,860
I already knew.

61
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,500
You knew yet you still said that.

62
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,060
Did you plan it?

63
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,740
I didn't go so far as to plan it. But I gave it a shot.

64
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,640
You gave it a shot and you guessed that I could fall for you?

65
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,400
No, I didn't sense it then.

66
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,200
Oh...

67
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:18,950
Then...since then, everything you did for me was all calculated.

68
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:27,340
Perhaps...was your mom part of the plan, too?

69
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,730
No.

70
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,650
That's a relief.

71
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:42,400
Then the kindness that you had shown me, the conversation about your father, was that all calculated?

72
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,390
I calculated it a bit.

73
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,830
So then why did you do it?

74
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,010
Why did you pretend not to know me when you did?

75
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:56,350
To get close to you, I knew you needed to think.

76
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,530
That I approached you not knowing from which family you came from.

77
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,590
That way you wouldn't be so guarded around me.

78
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:07,190
You are speaking as if you were talking about someone else's thoughts.

79
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,340
Why did you want to get close to me?

80
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:17,130
To keep making you like me. So I could marry you. So I could marry well and use it to my advantage.

81
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,570
You are brutally honest. You should have been brutally honest before.

82
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:28,970
Pretending to like me when you didn't.

83
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:32,150
Behaving to win a woman's favor.

84
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,930
Performing all kinds of flirtatious acts.

85
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,230
There's something I must set straight.

86
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,980
What do you want to set straight?

87
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:43,300
I didn't do much to win over your heart.

88
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,700
You were the first one that wanted to date.

89
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,840
You transformed a small gesture of kindness into special attention.

90
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:54,720
At that time, you would've fallen in love with someone even if it wasn't me.

91
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,980
Because you seemed like a person that made plans to fall in love.

92
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,180
Did you really think that?

93
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,920
Am I wrong?

94
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,920
No.

95
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,150
It's not wrong.

96
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,960
Because it was you...

97
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:36,100
Because it was you, Choi Joon Gi...I loved you.

98
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:48,420
So... don't laugh at my love,

99
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,060
you bastard.

100
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,350
I'll do it. You shouldn't be driving now.

101
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:13,230
Your survival instinct is still alive. Since I was going to hit you with this car.

102
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,510
Yoon Ha, are you alright?

103
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,430
Are you alright?

104
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,390
Don't touch me.

105
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,890
Leave the car like this. I'll call somebody to pick it up.

106
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,090
Did you want my background that much?

107
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:28,060
I wanted to die.

108
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,290
After my brother became like that, I wanted to die with him.

109
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,730
Despite that, I missed you.

110
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:41,950
As that happened, it disappeared. I was able to endure it. I gained determination.

111
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,790
"Ah, love is like this...

112
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:52,110
Even though it can't solve problems,

113
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:55,410
it gives the strength to overcome those problems.

114
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,650
Love is really something great."

115
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,690

126
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,320
What?

127
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,210
It's awkward.

128
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,970
For me, too.

129
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,110
Right?

130
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,970
Yeah.

131
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,550
Should we go out?

132
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,430
Yeah.

133
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,610
Yeah, let's go out.

134
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:40,730
Should we go after we talk a bit?

135
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:45,250
Don't you think it's weird to go out right after we went in?

136
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,070
Yeah, that's weird, too.

137
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,270
Tell me an interesting story.

138
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,840
You don't have one?

139
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,280
There was a frog and a scorpion.

140
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,340
It's a children's story?

141
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,200
The scorpion asks to the frog,

142
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:36,100
"Since I can't swim, give me ride to the other side of the river."

143
00:14:36,088 --> 00:14:38,408
And the frog says he can't,

144
00:14:38,408 --> 00:14:43,164
"Because you are a scorpion you'll sting me
and I'll eventually die."

145
00:14:43,448 --> 00:14:46,648
The frog must not wanted to give him a ride.

146
00:14:46,648 --> 00:14:52,488
If the scorpion stings the frog they will drown in the river together.

147
00:14:52,488 --> 00:14:54,028
Why would the scorpion sting?

148
00:14:54,028 --> 00:14:58,428
The scorpion said the same thing as you. Why would he sting, if they were both going to die?

149
00:14:58,488 --> 00:15:01,668
So what? Did the frog gave the scorpion the ride?

150
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:03,708
Yeah.

151
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:08,868
But then in the middle of the river, the scorpion stings the frog.

152
00:15:08,868 --> 00:15:10,588
Why?

153
00:15:10,588 --> 00:15:14,928
While dying the frog asks, "Why did you sting me?"

154
00:15:15,668 --> 00:15:20,908
And the scorpion says, "I couldn't help it."

155
00:15:22,508 --> 00:15:25,028
He said that stinging was in his nature.

156
00:15:36,928 --> 00:15:39,668
It's a very sad story.

157
00:15:49,228 --> 00:15:51,168
Ji Yi,

158
00:15:52,068 --> 00:15:55,048
I don't know if I'll become a scorpion to you.

159
00:15:56,288 --> 00:16:01,708
Even if I try not to, I might hurt you.

160
00:16:08,088 --> 00:16:11,368
You aren't hurting only me.

161
00:16:12,248 --> 00:16:17,508
In the end, the scorpion and the frog drowned in the water.

162
00:16:30,768 --> 00:16:33,588
If we're dying together, I'm okay with it.

163
00:16:39,828 --> 00:16:46,388
♫ Please don't be hurt from this ♫

164
00:16:46,388 --> 00:16:51,368
You can say you scared now.
♫ Because your tears will shake me up again ♫

165
00:16:51,368 --> 00:16:54,038
It's my choice.
♫ Because your tears will shake me up again ♫

166
00:16:54,828 --> 00:17:02,368
I'm not scared.
♫ As much as I am pushing you away ♫

167
00:17:02,368 --> 00:17:04,328
♫ It may hurt  ♫

168
00:17:04,328 --> 00:17:09,088
Instead, promise me;
♫ but I have to hold back from you ♫

169
00:17:09,088 --> 00:17:11,148
that you won't say you're sorry.
♫ but I have to hold back from you ♫

170
00:17:11,148 --> 00:17:16,968
♫ Tears are spilling out ♫

171
00:17:16,968 --> 00:17:20,618
♫ Though I try to push you away ♫

172
00:17:20,618 --> 00:17:27,118
♫ And make an effort to hold it ♫

173
00:17:42,088 --> 00:17:44,478
Did you select a lawyer?

174
00:17:44,478 --> 00:17:47,948
Yes. I chose one and met him.

175
00:17:47,948 --> 00:17:50,728
It's a good firm that doesn't spread rumors.

176
00:17:50,728 --> 00:17:52,648
Sit, have a glass.

177
00:17:52,648 --> 00:17:55,508
No, I won't drink.

178
00:17:57,608 --> 00:17:59,848
Well, then. What did he say?

179
00:17:59,848 --> 00:18:03,168
He would try to divide the stocks into 5 to 5.

180
00:18:03,188 --> 00:18:06,668
But, in reality, that won't fully be accepted.

181
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:09,008
Since the President's capability is so great,

182
00:18:09,008 --> 00:18:12,228
and he also has some wealth that he has inherited.

183
00:18:12,228 --> 00:18:17,228
But why is Jang Won Shik so quiet?

184
00:18:17,228 --> 00:18:22,148
According to Secretary Song, the President doesn't have any interest in a divorce.

185
00:18:22,148 --> 00:18:26,838
He isn't acting upon any kind of gesture.

186
00:18:35,788 --> 00:18:40,168
Father, starting from today, I'm coming to the house.

187
00:18:41,748 --> 00:18:45,648
Did you guys decide who'll be in charge of the project at Incheon airport?

188
00:18:45,648 --> 00:18:48,348
We are in the middle of it.

189
00:18:48,348 --> 00:18:52,158
When Yoon Ha comes to work next week, I'm going to put her in charge of that.

190
00:18:52,158 --> 00:18:54,468
I already told you that we're the middle of it.

191
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:56,008
There hasn't been any results yet.

192
00:18:56,008 --> 00:19:00,348
But still... if you change the person-in-charge while the work is still being processed, there will be confusion.

193
00:19:00,388 --> 00:19:01,968
Then pass that work down to Yoon Ha.

194
00:19:01,968 --> 00:19:06,128
How can you give something so big to a person that doesn't have any prior company experience?

195
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:08,828
That will show that she's incompetent.

196
00:19:08,828 --> 00:19:13,008
It isn't that it would show that you are incompetent?

197
00:19:13,008 --> 00:19:13,808
What?

198
00:19:13,808 --> 00:19:19,748
It's like that. If someone who has no company experience is able to complete that work, what will become of you?

199
00:19:28,788 --> 00:19:30,568
Does he have to be like that?

200
00:19:30,568 --> 00:19:32,978
Even when Gyeong Joon was around, he would take my work

201
00:19:32,978 --> 00:19:36,348
and make room for him. And now this again?

202
00:19:36,348 --> 00:19:38,708
How great is Jang Yoon Ha?

203
00:19:42,178 --> 00:19:43,948
What are you doing?

204
00:19:43,948 --> 00:19:46,408
I was talking about the company with Father.

205
00:19:46,408 --> 00:19:50,028
Sleep well. Today is your first night at the house.

206
00:19:50,028 --> 00:19:51,648
Yes.

207
00:20:00,588 --> 00:20:02,628
Have a drink.

208
00:20:03,848 --> 00:20:09,048
Now, you are openly drinking? Why do you live like that?

209
00:20:09,048 --> 00:20:12,788
Then what about you? Are you living well?

210
00:20:25,998 --> 00:20:29,488
It's been over 40 years since we've been living together.

211
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:35,418
We had children together. Of course...

212
00:20:35,418 --> 00:20:38,718
I raised them alone.

213
00:20:38,718 --> 00:20:41,328
What do you want to say?

214
00:20:41,328 --> 00:20:44,728
I said we should get divorced so why aren't you answering me?

215
00:20:44,728 --> 00:20:47,058
You really want to get a divorce?

216
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:53,068
We've been married for forty years already, and now we don't even have children to raise.

217
00:20:53,068 --> 00:20:56,018
We just need to divide the wealth that we earned together.

218
00:20:56,018 --> 00:20:59,688
Earned together? When?

219
00:21:01,088 --> 00:21:03,728
I assisted you.

220
00:21:03,728 --> 00:21:07,158
I earned it myself.

221
00:21:07,158 --> 00:21:11,498
But did something really happen? Why do you want a divorce at this age?

222
00:21:11,498 --> 00:21:14,058
How is living after getting a divorce and living without getting a divorce any different?

223
00:21:14,058 --> 00:21:17,638
It may be the same for you, but not for me.

224
00:21:17,638 --> 00:21:21,118
Alright. Then let's get a divorce.

225
00:21:21,118 --> 00:21:24,468
What do you want to do? Do you want to get a divorce alone?

226
00:21:24,468 --> 00:21:28,428
People get a divorce when something happens. Why do you want to get a divorce?

227
00:21:28,428 --> 00:21:30,918
You always said get out at the slightest thing.

228
00:21:31,898 --> 00:21:35,098
You always said let's stop living at the slightest thing. What about all that now?

229
00:21:35,098 --> 00:21:38,238
Get out then. Stop living then.

230
00:21:38,238 --> 00:21:41,838
That's that, but I'm not getting a divorce.

231
00:21:41,838 --> 00:21:44,558
You living with me...

232
00:21:46,718 --> 00:21:50,728
Even though we're married, you don't even have a bit of affection.

233
00:21:50,728 --> 00:21:54,708
At this age, we are living by the law, as a family.

234
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:57,018
It's a win-win situation for the both of us.

235
00:21:58,058 --> 00:21:59,858
Can I also...

236
00:22:00,878 --> 00:22:03,278
meet another man?

237
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:04,508
No.

238
00:22:04,508 --> 00:22:09,778
If I want to get a divorce, I guess I have to meet another man.

239
00:22:09,778 --> 00:22:14,728
Before, you said that you have nothing to protect now, right?

240
00:22:14,728 --> 00:22:20,508
That's why I say that you still don't know anything. You really have nothing to protect?

241
00:22:20,508 --> 00:22:23,658
I don't.
- You...

242
00:22:24,578 --> 00:22:28,598
From some time, you left yourself out of your life.

243
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:31,318
What?
- Protect yourself.

244
00:22:31,318 --> 00:22:35,048
If we get a divorce, you will lose yourself.

245
00:22:35,048 --> 00:22:38,928
If you also lose the title of being my wife,

246
00:22:38,928 --> 00:22:43,278
there will really be nothing to protect in your life.

247
00:22:57,768 --> 00:23:00,768
You said that we should have a move-in celebration party. But are you working?

248
00:23:00,768 --> 00:23:04,498
Let's do it tomorrow. Yoon Ha said she can't do it today.

249
00:23:04,498 --> 00:23:07,678
I wonder if tomorrow will work...

250
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:09,318
What does that mean?

251
00:23:09,318 --> 00:23:12,098
The man that she's meeting right now, he has a record.

252
00:23:12,098 --> 00:23:15,498
Well, he approaches women based on their qualifications... or he dumps them.

253
00:23:15,498 --> 00:23:19,298
How do you know that?
- There's a relation between my friend's cousin.

254
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:23,358
She probably won't be able to snap out of it for a while and just cry.

255
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:45,588
It's not wrong.

256
00:23:45,588 --> 00:23:48,148
Because it's you...

257
00:23:48,148 --> 00:23:50,778
Because it was Choi Joon Gi...

258
00:23:51,818 --> 00:23:52,968
I loved you.

259
00:23:52,968 --> 00:23:56,618
♫ What should I do? ♫

260
00:23:56,618 --> 00:24:01,898
♫ What shall I do? ♫

261

271
00:25:09,618 --> 00:25:14,028
Your background is you. You can't separate yourself from your background.

272
00:25:14,028 --> 00:25:17,538
I don't understand. Why can't you make use of what you have?

273
00:25:17,538 --> 00:25:21,918
Your starting point is faster than others. Why do you go backwards and start off at the same point as others?

274
00:25:21,918 --> 00:25:25,798
I told you. My background isn't who I am.

275
00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:29,398
The reality is different. You're still...

276
00:25:29,398 --> 00:25:33,078
like this because you haven't made your dream a reality so you're saying that.

277
00:25:33,078 --> 00:25:37,778
Have you made that happen? Your dream into reality?

278
00:25:40,078 --> 00:25:41,398
Not yet.

279
00:25:42,518 --> 00:25:45,068
I'm in the process.

280
00:25:45,068 --> 00:25:53,158
♫ All day, I want to sleep in your arms ♫

281

♫ I can't block any of that ♫

283
00:26:05,098 --> 00:26:07,858
The dream you have...

284
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:10,518
is that reality to me?

285
00:26:13,768 --> 00:26:15,778
Just wait.

286
00:26:16,768 --> 00:26:18,878
I'll step on you.

287
00:26:45,608 --> 00:26:51,578
Ahjussi. Don't report anything about Choi Joon Gi to mom. Investigate more.

288
00:26:51,578 --> 00:26:56,168
I might marry him. It isn't a bad idea to look up every detail about him.

289
00:26:56,168 --> 00:27:00,498
And when does the decision regarding the issue with the branch come out?

290
00:27:03,468 --> 00:27:08,038
When a customer brings up their complaints, there are many times when they are agitated.

291
00:27:08,038 --> 00:27:13,158
It's most important to calm them by saying "I'm sorry for causing a disturbance."

292
00:27:13,158 --> 00:27:14,658
Try copying me.

293
00:27:14,658 --> 00:27:16,718
I'm sorry for causing a disturbance.

294
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:19,968
I'm sorry for causing a disturbance.

295
00:27:23,128 --> 00:27:27,558
The team you'll be a part of is the marketing team.

296
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:29,198
Introduce yourself.

297
00:27:29,198 --> 00:27:35,378
Hello, take care of me please. My name is Lee Ji Yi. Backwards, it's still Lee Ji Yi.

298
00:27:35,378 --> 00:27:39,798
Welcome, Lee Ji Yi.
- Welcome!
- Thank you.

299
00:27:43,438 --> 00:27:45,958
You're leaving a bit later today.

300
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:48,988
You even check the time I leave for work?

301
00:27:48,988 --> 00:27:52,538
Why are you being so cranky to me?

302
00:27:52,538 --> 00:27:54,398
I broke up with Ji Yi.

303
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:56,508
Are you sure?
- Yeah.

304
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,758
So don't go looking for her anymore.

305
00:27:58,758 --> 00:28:02,498
How can I believe you?
- You can't do anything but believe me.

306
00:28:02,498 --> 00:28:04,558
Don't bother her.

307
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:09,178
If I hear that you're still going to look for her to bother her even though we broke up, I won't sit still.

308
00:28:09,178 --> 00:28:12,598
If you broke up, how would you hear that she's being bothered?

309
00:28:12,598 --> 00:28:15,738
If you broke up, you wouldn't know.
- I told her when we broke up.

310
00:28:15,738 --> 00:28:19,498
That if you go look for her again, to tell me. And that I'd take responsibility for it.

311
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:22,118
If you're not going to meet her, why would I bother her?

312
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:26,128
Do you think I like doing that? I don't enjoy meeting her to say bad things.

313
00:28:26,128 --> 00:28:29,388
Then don't do that. Why do you go around saying those things to people?

314
00:28:29,388 --> 00:28:32,768
Let's say some other woman said those things to your daughter, would you feel good?

315
00:28:32,768 --> 00:28:36,418
If it were my daughter, why would people say things like that about her?

316
00:28:38,458 --> 00:28:42,918
Don't look at me like that. Life is like that.

317
00:28:42,918 --> 00:28:44,958
You know, too.

318
00:28:48,938 --> 00:28:51,218
Who is it?
[Yoon Ha]

319
00:28:51,218 --> 00:28:55,098
Why is she calling you when she's dating Joon Gi?

320
00:28:55,098 --> 00:28:58,128
Aish, really. I really don't like you lately.

321
00:28:58,128 --> 00:29:01,288
I like you.

322
00:29:01,288 --> 00:29:03,388
No, speak.

323
00:29:16,948 --> 00:29:19,248
What are you?
- What?

324
00:29:19,248 --> 00:29:23,298
Are you facing some hardship? And why did you change your hair?

325
00:29:23,298 --> 00:29:25,778
You knew, didn't you?
- Knew what?

326
00:29:25,778 --> 00:29:29,278
You knew. That's why you asked me.

327
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:32,478
If he approached me with an intent, what I'd do.

328
00:29:35,518 --> 00:29:38,838
Why didn't you tell me?

329
00:29:38,838 --> 00:29:43,778
Normally, the person would be the last one to hear it. How could I tell you?

330
00:29:43,778 --> 00:29:48,478
You did well not telling me. If you did, I would have thought you were being kind.

331
00:29:48,478 --> 00:29:51,398
I'm not kind.

332
00:29:51,398 --> 00:29:53,338
Even if I'm childish.

333
00:29:53,338 --> 00:29:55,758
Are you going to keep working with Joon Gi?

334
00:29:55,758 --> 00:29:59,398
Why?
- Why did you fight with Joon Gi at that time?

335
00:30:02,088 --> 00:30:08,018
You experienced the same thing as me. People don't change easily.

336
00:30:08,018 --> 00:30:11,918
He said he wanted to marry up by marrying me.

337
00:30:11,918 --> 00:30:15,508
That crazy bastard. Why is he so honest?

338
00:30:15,508 --> 00:30:18,488
You can laugh at this situation?
- Then should I cry?

339
00:30:18,488 --> 00:30:21,278
I was going to marry you for economic reasons as well. Are we okay?

340
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:23,738
Our whole lives are about economics.

341
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:26,148
So?

342
00:30:26,148 --> 00:30:28,998
Fire him.

343
00:30:28,998 --> 00:30:31,078
Who are you to tell me to fire him or not?

344
00:30:31,078 --> 00:30:34,358
Where did the person who said they hate being used the most go?

345
00:30:34,358 --> 00:30:36,578
He approached you and used you, Chang Soo.

346
00:30:36,578 --> 00:30:39,938
If you put it that way, I used him, too.

347
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:42,218
We needed each other.

348
00:30:42,218 --> 00:30:46,378
So saying one side used the other person while the other was being used isn't right.

349
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:49,208
Of course, you were friends because you're the same, huh.

350
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:53,118
We are not friends.

351
00:30:55,398 --> 00:30:57,138
I have to go.

352
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:03,278
If I were to give you one last piece of advice...

353
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:07,208
You need to be more meticulous if you want to face Joon Gi.

354
00:31:07,208 --> 00:31:10,628
If you run around the streets like a beast who was hurt,

355
00:31:10,628 --> 00:31:12,228
you are going to get hurt more.

356
00:31:12,228 --> 00:31:18,358
Do you really think I came to meet you with a goal of getting you to fire Joon Gi?

357
00:31:18,358 --> 00:31:22,068
Wasn't it?
- No.

358
00:31:22,068 --> 00:31:26,128
You and Joon Gi. What kind of things come between you.

359
00:31:26,128 --> 00:31:29,128
If I could use those differences against him... I came to find that out.

360
00:31:31,238 --> 00:31:35,538
That guy approached me because he desired my background.

361
00:31:35,538 --> 00:31:40,378
I'm going to step on him with the thing that he liked so much.

362
00:31:41,928 --> 00:31:43,668
Come in.

363
00:31:48,518 --> 00:31:50,578
Bring some tea.

364
00:31:51,678 --> 00:31:54,658
I heard you're Yoo Min Department Store's planning department's ace.

365
00:31:54,658 --> 00:31:55,838
Thank you.

366
00:31:55,838 --> 00:31:58,838
I will talk about another matter.

367
00:31:58,838 --> 00:32:01,098
Let's work together.

368
00:32:01,098 --> 00:32:04,458
I would like to work with anyone. As long as the conditions match, I'll do it.

369
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:06,248
I heard that you are working things out with Secretary Lee.

370
00:32:06,248 --> 00:32:10,698
When I talk about salary, I discuss it with the one who wants me.

371
00:32:10,698 --> 00:32:15,238
I heard you have abilities, but I don't know if you really do or not.

372
00:32:15,238 --> 00:32:20,598
I also heard that I'm needed, but I don't know why I'm needed.

373
00:32:20,598 --> 00:32:23,718
I broke up with Jang Yoon Ha.

374
00:32:23,718 --> 00:32:28,958
Really?
- So I won't be of any use if it has to do with Yoon Ha.

375
00:32:28,958 --> 00:32:31,438
What are your conditions?

376
00:32:31,438 --> 00:32:35,498
Money, rank, working condition.

377
00:32:35,498 --> 00:32:40,678
I heard that the Yoo Min Department Store Director hasn't decided our company's ranking.

378
00:32:40,678 --> 00:32:42,918
Bring that to me.

379
00:32:42,918 --> 00:32:45,648
Then I will pay you the maximum amount for your skill.

380
00:32:46,658 --> 00:32:51,478
I understand. In return, give me negotiation authority.

381
00:33:20,838 --> 00:33:24,168
It seems like a client came.
- Yes, take a seat.

382
00:33:26,918 --> 00:33:29,698
How was it? The first day at the company?

383
00:33:29,698 --> 00:33:31,938
I haven't yet adjusted.

384
00:33:31,938 --> 00:33:36,738
I got my first assignment. To get a place in the Incheon airport stores.

385
00:33:36,738 --> 00:33:40,878
Can you do it?
- It's something that has to get done.

386
00:33:40,878 --> 00:33:42,758
It's not important if I am able to do it.

387
00:33:42,758 --> 00:33:46,698
I wish your actions would follow your position.

388
00:33:46,698 --> 00:33:51,258
You didn't forget that the three of us sisters were going to hang out at the house later, right?
- I got it.

389
00:34:01,808 --> 00:34:04,288
Why are you sitting in somebody else's seat?

390
00:34:07,538 --> 00:34:13,238
You acted so high and mighty... In the end you got tricked by someone who just wanted your money.

391
00:34:15,438 --> 00:34:18,008
I am the older sister anyway.

392
00:34:20,438 --> 00:34:26,758
I met that girl. She was talking badly about Joon Gi because she wasn't over him.

393
00:34:26,758 --> 00:34:30,188
Don't recklessly give away my phone number.

394
00:34:30,188 --> 00:34:32,198
And...

395
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:38,098
don't just come into my office.

396
00:34:53,778 --> 00:34:55,658
Yes, hello?

397
00:34:57,378 --> 00:35:01,258
What are you doing?
- I came to the cafeteria just a moment to eat lunch.

398
00:35:01,258 --> 00:35:03,868
I told you we would have to eat together, that won't do.

399
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:07,218
No, we can't. I need time to get situated at work.

400
00:35:07,218 --> 00:35:10,478
I have to eat with my team. I'm already here because of my connection.

401
00:35:10,478 --> 00:35:13,218
You sound really happy today.

402
00:35:13,218 --> 00:35:17,628
I am happy today. I'm a full time employee!
I will work hard.

403
00:35:17,628 --> 00:35:19,178
So when are you going to meet me?

404
00:35:19,178 --> 00:35:21,658
I am not sure.

405
00:35:21,658 --> 00:35:25,808
You are not sure?
- Yes, I am not sure...

406
00:35:25,808 --> 00:35:28,198
Can't I eat now? I am hungry.

407
00:35:28,198 --> 00:35:30,298
Hey, in your world does food beat me?

408
00:35:30,298 --> 00:35:32,958
If I'm hungry, I have to fill myself, of course.

409
00:35:34,038 --> 00:35:37,658
I got it. Eat.

410
00:35:40,098 --> 00:35:42,278
That girl...

411
00:35:46,288 --> 00:35:48,048
Ta-da!

412
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:52,268
Why did you come out with this?

413
00:35:52,268 --> 00:35:54,718
Because I am proud of it.

414
00:35:54,718 --> 00:35:57,338
When eating you don't have time.

415
00:35:57,338 --> 00:36:01,258
If somebody saw, they'd–
- If somebody saw, they'd think I was an intern.

416
00:36:01,258 --> 00:36:04,428
We don't have time for this. I only have forty minutes left for lunch break.

417
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:06,678
What should we eat here?

418
00:36:06,678 --> 00:36:08,508
There.

419
00:36:10,578 --> 00:36:13,498
You're going to eat ddeokbokki for lunch?

420
00:36:13,498 --> 00:36:17,298
It's better to be together for a while than to waste time going back and forth.

421
00:36:17,298 --> 00:36:20,018
Ahh... How did I end up meeting someone at an intern level?

422
00:36:20,018 --> 00:36:25,798
How did I end up meeting a director? It's nice! He can match my schedule.

423
00:36:34,248 --> 00:36:39,918
Hey, how many germs do you think are in this? It's not very clean and it's on the side of the street.

424
00:36:39,918 --> 00:36:42,458
Humans are bags of bacteria.

425
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:45,078
If you don't wash your hands even once, your hands are teeming with bacteria.

426
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:47,078
You made the tteokbokki taste bad.

427
00:36:47,078 --> 00:36:50,858
You don't have to eat it. I can eat it all.

428
00:36:50,858 --> 00:36:54,368
Sanitary and fancy food... Eat that later!

429
00:36:56,598 --> 00:36:58,908
I am hungry, too.

430
00:37:00,558 --> 00:37:05,398
♫ When I look at you, my heart grows so full ♫

431
00:37:05,398 --> 00:37:14,198
♫ That it beats toward you. No one knows how I feel. Do you know? ♫

432
00:37:16,558 --> 00:37:22,298
♫ All day, soft and gentle words come into my ears ♫

433
00:37:22,298 --> 00:37:27,278
♫ Your name is stuck on my lips ♫

434
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:31,618
♫ No one knows how I feel. Will my heart reach you? ♫

435
00:37:31,618 --> 00:37:34,598
Is it that good?
- Yes.

436
00:37:34,598 --> 00:37:36,448
Give me.

437
00:37:41,518 --> 00:37:43,318
It's good, right?

438
00:37:43,318 --> 00:37:45,038
Not really.

439
00:37:47,138 --> 00:37:52,658
Oh, it's so good! First, ddeokbokki then, instant coffee!

440
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:56,778
I think I have to go back now.

441
00:37:56,778 --> 00:38:00,278
Go back. It was what you wanted so do a good job.

442
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,548
Yes.

443
00:38:01,548 --> 00:38:03,348
I won't be able to see you later. I have an appointment.

444
00:38:03,348 --> 00:38:06,708
Okay, call me.

445
00:38:10,918 --> 00:38:13,698
Hey, hey!

446
00:38:13,698 --> 00:38:16,638
She's going to fall like that.

447
00:38:26,978 --> 00:38:28,028
What?

448
00:38:28,028 --> 00:38:32,958
Yoo Min Department Store... Why won't they decide a place for our company?

449
00:38:32,958 --> 00:38:35,828
It's probably not worth it so they're not doing it.

450
00:38:35,828 --> 00:38:38,298
Tell them to come to a decision.

451
00:38:38,298 --> 00:38:40,158
Are you asking me a favor?

452
00:38:40,158 --> 00:38:42,178
Yes, a favor.

453
00:38:42,178 --> 00:38:43,898
I got it.

454
00:39:01,708 --> 00:39:03,598
What happened?

455
00:39:03,598 --> 00:39:09,378
Our store in the Incheon airport... Location 7 and 11, is it not going to Taejin Cosmetics?

456
00:39:09,378 --> 00:39:13,938
Taejin Cosmetics costs a lot to import whereas the other cosmetics are not.

457
00:39:13,938 --> 00:39:16,878
It'll be better for the store to have a brand like Taejin.

458
00:39:16,878 --> 00:39:19,908
That's why we're divided internally.

459
00:39:19,908 --> 00:39:25,798
Let's do it like this. Let's give them the fees they want and they can take care of the promotions.

460
00:39:25,798 --> 00:39:27,318
One promotion?

461
00:39:27,318 --> 00:39:32,918
We'll receive one and get them to do a department store gift card event as well.

462
00:39:32,918 --> 00:39:35,618
That's pretty good. There's nothing bad for Taejin either.

463
00:39:35,618 --> 00:39:39,478
It's a win-win situation.
- Alright, I'll pass it on. Thanks!

464
00:39:45,318 --> 00:39:47,998
Yoo Min Department Store said they decided on the locations.

465
00:39:47,998 --> 00:39:54,158
I know. I got a call from Choi Joon Gi. I will go to the President.

466
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:58,818
If it was going to be resolved in an instant, why couldn't you resolve it all this time?

467
00:40:02,838 --> 00:40:04,758
You may leave.

468
00:40:13,408 --> 00:40:15,818
Out of the matters that involve Yoo Min Department Store...

469
00:40:15,868 --> 00:40:18,468
are there any meetings today?

470
00:40:19,468 --> 00:40:21,608
Then their planning department...

471
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:25,128
Say that Deputy Manager Choi Joon Gi has to come.

472
00:40:30,318 --> 00:40:35,088
Deputy Manager?
- Yeah?
- We have to go to Taejin for the new deal with their cosmetics...

473
00:40:35,088 --> 00:40:38,328
And they say that they really want you to come.

474
00:40:38,328 --> 00:40:42,918
Me?
- Yes.
- Alright.

475
00:40:53,638 --> 00:40:57,048
Ahjumma! Sit.

476
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:59,978
Okay, after I turn off the stove.

477
00:41:04,438 --> 00:41:07,758
Yes?
- Ahjumma.

478
00:41:07,778 --> 00:41:12,218
Do you have some sort of relation to Taejin Group?

479
00:41:12,268 --> 00:41:15,908
Taejin Group...
- I was going to fire you...

480
00:41:15,908 --> 00:41:21,208
but I didn't. What kind of connection could you possibly have with Taejin Group?

481
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:24,878
Then the President...
- That's right.

482
00:41:26,178 --> 00:41:28,928
What would I hide from you?

483
00:41:28,928 --> 00:41:30,988
It's Taejin Group's President.

484
00:41:31,658 --> 00:41:35,848
Why did they? What are you involved with for them to say that?

485
00:41:40,678 --> 00:41:44,708
I...will quit.

486
00:41:45,238 --> 00:41:47,908
What?
- I want to stop working here.

487
00:41:47,958 --> 00:41:50,838
If you're going to suddenly quit right now, what am I going to do?

488
00:41:50,838 --> 00:41:53,708
How are you involved with Taejin Group?

489
00:41:53,708 --> 00:41:56,068
I'm sorry.

490
00:41:56,098 --> 00:41:59,828
I don't think I can stay until you find another person.

491
00:41:59,828 --> 00:42:03,828
If you're going to go...then at least stay here and finish everything for today.

492
00:42:13,938 --> 00:42:17,818
If you wait here, the person in charge of this will come.

493
00:42:59,488 --> 00:43:04,548
Today, the person in charge went on a business trip because of something else. I'm sorry.

494
00:43:04,568 --> 00:43:07,728
We will schedule another appointment with you next time.

495
00:43:07,758 --> 00:43:12,338
Excuse me. Team Leader Jang Yoon Ha...

496
00:43:12,338 --> 00:43:14,668
Did she come to work today?

497
00:43:29,408 --> 00:43:31,148
How did you come here?

498
00:43:31,148 --> 00:43:35,558
After being trained like a dog, I just stopped by on my way out.

499
00:43:36,288 --> 00:43:39,988
You're smart. Of course,

500
00:43:39,988 --> 00:43:41,968
you were able to seduce women because you are smart.

501
00:43:41,998 --> 00:43:46,708
Whatever you say and whatever you do, I'll accept it.

502
00:43:47,218 --> 00:43:51,518
Don't ruin yourself.
- A cat is worrying about a mouse.

503
00:43:53,508 --> 00:43:57,738
Whether I'm ruined or not, what does that have to do with you?

504
00:43:58,508 --> 00:44:01,758
To find out when I started to recognize you,

505
00:44:01,758 --> 00:44:04,328
why don't you ask the most important thing?

506
00:44:06,128 --> 00:44:07,788
Because it doesn't matter if I ask or not.

507
00:44:07,788 --> 00:44:11,288
What doesn't matter if you ask or not?
- You don't love me.

508
00:44:16,388 --> 00:44:19,748
Then I'll ask one thing, too.
- What?

509
00:44:20,618 --> 00:44:22,568
Do you love me?

510
00:44:25,278 --> 00:44:28,868
No.
- To look good to you...

511
00:44:28,868 --> 00:44:32,118
when I hid things from you and approached you with an intent, did you love me?

512
00:44:38,958 --> 00:44:40,658
Why are you like this?

513
00:44:42,878 --> 00:44:48,158
If you loved me then, then you have to love me now.

514
00:44:49,278 --> 00:44:54,148
That's love. Even if I did wrong to you...

515
00:44:55,908 --> 00:45:00,508
Even if you can't understand me with your head, you should accept me with your heart.

516
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:03,268
That's love.

517
00:45:07,578 --> 00:45:09,728
Let me ask one thing.

518
00:45:11,698 --> 00:45:13,908
Why didn't you lie?

519
00:45:15,738 --> 00:45:17,788
Why did you innocently...

520
00:45:18,728 --> 00:45:20,858
tell me everything honestly?

521
00:45:29,308 --> 00:45:30,918
Because I love you.

522
00:45:32,928 --> 00:45:35,108
So I couldn't lie.

523
00:45:40,298 --> 00:45:42,648
I came to love you.

524
00:45:45,378 --> 00:45:47,898
From when, I don't know either.

525
00:45:51,418 --> 00:45:55,618
I'm sorry. I...

526
00:45:55,638 --> 00:45:58,258
thought you were that kind of person.

527
00:45:59,728 --> 00:46:02,098
But you were different.

528
00:46:08,688 --> 00:46:10,838
In this field...

529
00:46:14,178 --> 00:46:16,618
I'm not going to let you step in.

530
00:46:21,558 --> 00:46:24,218
I think I'm going to move to Taejin Group.

531
00:46:24,218 --> 00:46:28,268
I got recruited by Executive Director Jang Ye Won. The salary, benefits,

532
00:46:28,268 --> 00:46:31,408
and the working conditions are much better than my current job.

533
00:46:32,918 --> 00:46:38,438
A normal person would have rejected your sister's offer because of you.

534
00:46:39,468 --> 00:46:41,268
But I accepted it.

535
00:46:42,048 --> 00:46:46,348
Life is more important than love.

536
00:46:47,198 --> 00:46:49,548
Surviving in life is more important to me.

537
00:46:53,068 --> 00:46:55,548
I told you about my father, right?

538
00:46:55,598 --> 00:47:00,078
What I really wanted to say, was that even when receiving insults...

539
00:47:00,078 --> 00:47:03,278
protecting your work position is not a man.

540
00:47:04,648 --> 00:47:06,848
But even when receiving insults...

541
00:47:07,848 --> 00:47:10,878
he had to beg in front of his child.

542
00:47:12,088 --> 00:47:14,928
I don't want to live as that kind of pathetic man.

543
00:47:16,788 --> 00:47:19,338
Even when you receive insults...

544
00:47:19,368 --> 00:47:23,358
enduring the embarrassment of having to beg in front of your child,

545
00:47:23,388 --> 00:47:26,018
do you know how amazing of a heart that is?

546
00:47:26,558 --> 00:47:28,118
I know.

547
00:47:29,078 --> 00:47:32,768
That's why my heart hurts.
- Do you even have a heart?

548
00:47:32,768 --> 00:47:34,868
Why wouldn't I?

549
00:47:36,638 --> 00:47:41,318
Get out. Don't try to make me weak by bringing up your parents.

550
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:45,258
This is just the beginning. You should watch out.

551
00:47:45,258 --> 00:47:49,798
See how I torment you, using that 'background' you liked.

552
00:47:50,798 --> 00:47:52,408
I'll look forward to it.

553
00:47:54,408 --> 00:47:58,858
Don't let your heart weaken. Don't forgive me either.

554
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:32,278
Yes, it's Choi Joon Gi.

555
00:48:34,538 --> 00:48:37,378
I accept your conditions.
- Thank you.

556
00:48:37,398 --> 00:48:40,888
Start coming to work next week.
- Yes.

557
00:48:54,108 --> 00:48:56,218
What did you want to say?

558
00:48:57,838 --> 00:48:59,858
I'm moving companies.

559
00:49:01,528 --> 00:49:05,558
Why?
- I left a scar on your innocence.

560
00:49:05,578 --> 00:49:08,408
Oh, you know, huh?
- You

561
00:49:08,898 --> 00:49:12,248
can't accept me.
- At least, you know.

562
00:49:13,348 --> 00:49:17,808
I didn't even know I had that class-based elitism that you talk about.

563
00:49:18,678 --> 00:49:20,788
It's not something I can overcome.

564
00:49:20,818 --> 00:49:23,808
I don't even have the desire to overcome it.

565
00:49:23,828 --> 00:49:25,658
I know.
- Even when you know,

566
00:49:25,658 --> 00:49:29,348
why couldn't you have accepted me for who I am?
- I did.

567
00:49:29,378 --> 00:49:32,948
I just...couldn't give you my heart.

568
00:49:32,948 --> 00:49:35,178
You're a bit weird.

569
00:49:35,178 --> 00:49:38,018
How could you not have your heart stolen by me?

570
00:49:38,038 --> 00:49:40,618
Aren't I pretty good?

571
00:49:40,668 --> 00:49:44,158
You're pretty good. I told you.

572
00:49:44,208 --> 00:49:46,318
I know a lot.

573
00:49:46,348 --> 00:49:49,328
About the company. About you, too.

574
00:49:50,248 --> 00:49:52,038
If you need my help, ask me.

575
00:49:52,038 --> 00:49:55,718
In return, it has to be a deal. I won't do it for free.

576
00:49:55,728 --> 00:49:57,458
Just stay.

577
00:49:58,218 --> 00:50:00,978
I took a detour and acted childish, but

578
00:50:01,568 --> 00:50:03,578
I won't do that anymore.

579
00:50:04,878 --> 00:50:07,008
You don't like me anymore.

580
00:50:07,458 --> 00:50:11,658
You have to try when you talk to me. Let's not do that.

581
00:50:11,678 --> 00:50:13,628
If we're apart,

582
00:50:14,238 --> 00:50:17,468
maybe you'll come to understand me.

583
00:50:18,118 --> 00:50:20,678
I can't understand you, you bastard.

584
00:50:20,698 --> 00:50:23,608
I don't like the fact that you stayed beside me with other thoughts in mind.

585
00:50:23,608 --> 00:50:25,908
You told me before, right?

586
00:50:25,928 --> 00:50:30,088
When a person doesn't express themselves, there are two reasons.

587
00:50:30,868 --> 00:50:33,248
Whether a person expresses himself or not,

588
00:50:33,248 --> 00:50:37,928
there is one reason. There is no point in saying it.

589
00:50:40,408 --> 00:50:42,588
I was like that towards you.

590
00:51:23,438 --> 00:51:26,778
The things that you can deal with when you're the weak one, why can't you use it when you're the strong one?

591
00:51:26,778 --> 00:51:29,578
That's why I say I don't like poverty. Why are you intimidated?

592
00:51:29,578 --> 00:51:32,618
Because personality is important.

593
00:51:32,618 --> 00:51:38,018
We don't feel small even in front of a chaebol. That's what you should say.

594
00:51:47,988 --> 00:51:49,398
You came?

595
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:51,738
When did you arrive? I keep finding you here.

596
00:51:51,738 --> 00:51:54,458
Come over here after washing up. Let's eat.

597
00:51:54,458 --> 00:52:00,078
Today, I made your favorite; spicy pork bulgogi.

598
00:52:01,188 --> 00:52:04,038
I emptied out the refrigerator. There is spicy pork bulgogi.

599
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:06,118
Your mom must be good at cooking.

600
00:52:06,118 --> 00:52:08,978
Her kimchi is art! The bean paste is delicious, too.

601
00:52:09,778 --> 00:52:13,998
I think a man and a woman are fascinating.

602
00:52:13,998 --> 00:52:17,238
How can we get this close in such a short time?

603
00:52:17,238 --> 00:52:22,658
How can I believe in you so quickly?

604
00:52:26,088 --> 00:52:27,928
What?

605
00:52:27,928 --> 00:52:31,688
What? No. I'll go wash up.

606
00:52:40,798 --> 00:52:44,138
Why aren't you eating? You like it.

607
00:52:44,138 --> 00:52:46,378
It's not reeling me in today.

608
00:52:46,378 --> 00:52:48,918
Did you meet Yoon Ha?

609
00:52:51,288 --> 00:52:53,388
We broke up.

610
00:52:57,118 --> 00:52:59,118
I'm sorry, Joon Gi.

611
00:52:59,118 --> 00:53:00,758
Why are you sorry?

612
00:53:00,758 --> 00:53:04,738
You two broke up because of me, right?

613
00:53:05,778 --> 00:53:08,938
Because it was revealed that I wouldn't be of any help to her household.

614
00:53:08,938 --> 00:53:12,058
Her household went crazy, didn't they?

615
00:53:14,278 --> 00:53:18,738
Because of me, you guys are suffering, aren't you?

616
00:53:20,898 --> 00:53:22,818
No, it's not like that.

617
00:53:24,148 --> 00:53:26,308
Where have you been working?

618
00:53:26,308 --> 00:53:28,848
The mistress'.

619
00:53:31,188 --> 00:53:33,248
It's alright.

620
00:53:33,248 --> 00:53:36,348
It's not because of you, so don't worry.

621
00:53:37,828 --> 00:53:39,668
We were going to break up anyway.

622
00:53:39,668 --> 00:53:44,588
You liked her. You liked her a lot.

623
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:50,968
You saw wrong. If a young man and woman date, a break up is inevitable.

624
00:53:50,968 --> 00:53:55,008
We didn't break up because of you, so don't say any nonsense.

625
00:53:55,958 --> 00:53:57,878
Alright.

626
00:53:58,978 --> 00:54:01,458
You eat, too

627
00:54:02,678 --> 00:54:04,378
Okay.

628
00:54:55,078 --> 00:54:58,418
Drinking soju here is really good.

629
00:54:58,418 --> 00:55:00,418
Didn't you hate soju?

630
00:55:00,418 --> 00:55:04,078
But this is sweet. Since I'm drinking it during a painful time.

631
00:55:04,078 --> 00:55:06,798
Now you know the taste of alcohol.

632
00:55:06,798 --> 00:55:09,458
That's why soju tastes good to me.

633
00:55:11,318 --> 00:55:12,818
I want to kill him.

634
00:55:12,818 --> 00:55:15,498
No matter how tough of a time we're having, let's not kill people.

635
00:55:15,498 --> 00:55:17,178
If not, I want to dig his eyes out.

636
00:55:17,178 --> 00:55:18,958
Hey!

637
00:55:20,258 --> 00:55:23,558
How could he send me that kind of gaze?

638
00:55:23,558 --> 00:55:25,978
Are you still wavering even after you were fooled?

639
00:55:28,018 --> 00:55:31,818
Yeah... Because I opened my heart, I started to waver...

640
00:55:33,478 --> 00:55:36,038
I guess you did love him.

641
00:55:36,878 --> 00:55:40,078
A person's name is important, just as I thought.

642
00:55:40,078 --> 00:55:45,478
What the heck is Choi Joon Gi. It reminds you of the thing that we are most sensitive to and want to hide. Our weight.
(play on words. chaejoong means weight)

643
00:55:45,478 --> 00:55:49,428
What kind of crap are you saying now?

644
00:55:49,428 --> 00:55:51,238
You laughed!

645
00:55:57,188 --> 00:56:00,748
This is Lee Ji Yi of the marketing department.

646
00:56:00,748 --> 00:56:03,208
You like it that much?

647
00:56:03,208 --> 00:56:04,588
I do.

648
00:56:04,588 --> 00:56:07,228
It's a full-time position I only dreamed about.

649
00:56:07,228 --> 00:56:08,228
Are you going somewhere?

650
00:56:08,228 --> 00:56:12,028
My meeting is over now so I'm going home. What are you doing?

651
00:56:12,028 --> 00:56:14,268
I'm drinking with Yoon Ha.

652
00:56:14,268 --> 00:56:19,108
Don't hang out with her for now. She's so angry right now if you get on her wrong side, you'll die.

653
00:56:19,108 --> 00:56:21,608
She's not like that towards me.

654
00:56:21,608 --> 00:56:23,948
Go back home safely.

655
00:56:25,688 --> 00:56:28,288
Did he talk shit about me?

656
00:56:28,288 --> 00:56:29,288
Yoon Ha.

657
00:56:29,288 --> 00:56:30,808
What?

658
00:56:30,808 --> 00:56:35,408
About Deputy Manager... I kind of understand him.

659
00:56:35,408 --> 00:56:38,408
Maybe it's because we're of the same background.

660
00:56:38,408 --> 00:56:44,888
What he said about getting by in life rather than focusing on love, it hits home.

661
00:56:50,098 --> 00:56:54,038
What am I doing with Director Jerk right now?

662
00:57:00,548 --> 00:57:02,548
Cheers.

663
00:57:02,548 --> 00:57:05,008
I don't have any.
- Really?

664
00:57:06,968 --> 00:57:08,928
Cheers!

665
00:57:14,458 --> 00:57:16,318
You're late.

666
00:57:16,318 --> 00:57:18,058
I had a meeting.

667
00:57:18,058 --> 00:57:20,298
See me for a second.

668
00:57:48,728 --> 00:57:51,648
We're here. Go back safely!

669
00:57:52,318 --> 00:57:53,988
The landlord is out.

670
00:57:53,988 --> 00:57:55,018
Oh, she is.

671
00:57:55,018 --> 00:57:57,158
Why is she there?

672
00:57:57,158 --> 00:57:58,128
Take care!

673
00:57:58,128 --> 00:58:00,188
Yeah, take care!

674
00:58:08,888 --> 00:58:09,988
Hello!

675
00:58:09,988 --> 00:58:11,888
Why are you so late?

676
00:58:11,888 --> 00:58:13,898
Were you waiting for me?

677
00:58:14,938 --> 00:58:17,198
You'll have to leave immediately.

678
00:58:17,198 --> 00:58:18,618
What?

679
00:58:18,618 --> 00:58:21,188
There's still time left on the contract. That's nonsense.

680
00:58:21,188 --> 00:58:24,418
If it doesn't make sense, then take it to court! My head hurts, too.

681
00:58:24,418 --> 00:58:29,018
Ahjumma! You need to tell me what the reason is.

682
00:58:29,728 --> 00:58:34,608
They said they'd give me more money. They'd give me five times more!

683
00:58:36,648 --> 00:58:39,528
Didn't you say you broke up?

684
00:58:39,528 --> 00:58:41,968
Do you look at me as a joke?

685
00:58:43,718 --> 00:58:45,638
Because I let things go,

686
00:58:45,638 --> 00:58:48,598
you back stab me this way?

687
00:58:50,788 --> 00:58:54,988
You...do you like that Ji Yi is being hurt?
