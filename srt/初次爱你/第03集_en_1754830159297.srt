00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:51,210
What kind of cake

6
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,660
does Ren Chu like?

7
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,140
As long as I can get close to him,

8
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,460
I'll donate cake mix.

9
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,380
Thirty bags.

10
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,060
Thank you.

11
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,340
Next.

12
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,140
I like him.

13
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,139
He likes baking.

14
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:10,270
So I like baking too.

15
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,850
Then you should go to the swimming club.

16
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,260

Ren Chu...

23
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,750
It turned out that

24
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,380
no one came here for the bakery.

25
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,860
Everyone,

26
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,740
I have nothing to do with Ren Chu.

27
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,620
He will never come here.

28
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,900
If you come for him,

29
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,060
you can leave now.

Why?

35
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,740
So many people

36
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,930
are gossiping about us.

37
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,740
You must feel uncomfortable too.

38
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,420
No.

39
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,660
Then just do me a favor out of your kindness.

40
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,700
I don't do favors for people like you.

41
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,180
And my friendly mode has been closed.

42
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:27,940
If your future girlfriend

43
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,690
knows about this,

44
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,980
she'll be very sad.

45
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,900

46
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,829

I'm like a thief in class.

50
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,500
If this goes on,

51
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,820

52
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,150
How did you do in your exams last semester?

53
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:48,740
I got a C.

54
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,740
I may not have good grades, but...

55
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,470
Whether there's a rumor or not,

56
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,820
your grades are not good.

57
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,140
How can you say that?

58
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:56,740
I knew the answers.

59
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,340
It's just during the exam...

60
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,090
It's like a public execution.

61
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,130
Come on.

62
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,140
I just want to be

63
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,100
invisible.

64
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,180
Since I got involved with you,

65
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,310
the teacher started to look at me more.

66
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,649
If he looks at me during the exam,

67
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,420
I'll get nervous

68
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,380
and forget all I've learned.

69
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,180
My grades will be worse.

70
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,540
You should understand

71
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,620
you won't find the exam so difficult once you've mastered all the knowledge.

72
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,500
We don't match according to our star signs

73
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,500

74
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,880
Medical students should have accepted basic education of materialism.

75
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:50,700
I just said you wouldn't show up.

76
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,380
Then you came.

77
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,140
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

78
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:53,980
I wanted to ask Meng Xibai to help me with

79
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,860
the clinical practice of anatomy.

80
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,900
He said you asked him to help you with your study

81
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,980
and told me to sit in.

82
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,540
It's hard to contact Meng Xibai who doesn't use the phone.

83
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,020
It's easier to find you.

84
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,860
Are you taking an anatomy class?

85
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,020
What did you have for breakfast?

86
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:06,940
What's wrong?

87
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,130
Turn right ahead.

88
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,330
Take the shady lanes.

89
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,140
Do you have to guide me on the phone?

90
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,060
The RA said

91
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,940
people are spreading rumors about us spending the night together.

92
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,900
I can't show up with you now.

93
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,060
If someone takes photos of us,

94
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,860
I can do nothing to clear my name.

95
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,300
Isn't that Ren Chu?

96
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,660
Why are they together?

97
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,820
See?

98
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,090
The rumor will get me in trouble.

99
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,460
People will pay attention to me wherever I go.

100
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,940
Sign the document now.

101
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,180
I've been wearing a hat these days.

102
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,860
My classmates said I didn't wash my hair.

103
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,780
It makes me look like I'm scruffy.

104
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,480
Everyone is watching.

105
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,500
You look like a celebrity.

106
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,670
That's why they always look at you.

107
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,570
I...

108
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,180
How about

109
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,380
we exchange numbers?

110
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,580
Let's talk on the phone.

111
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,100
Send a secret signal first before we speak.

112
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,380
Let's go to the library later.

113
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,140
Sure.

114
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,480
How's your review?

115
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,210
Not bad.

116
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,060
This place is nice.

117
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,780
Scan me, or I scan you?

118
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,500
Don't you want to add me on WeChat?

119
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,340
I agree.

120
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:31,620
I...

121
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,900
My senior is a postgraduate.

122
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,380
He has a serious face.

123
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,190
Everyone in our class is afraid of him.

124
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,260
You have to be prepared.

125
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,780
He is professional and rational.

126
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,780
He's not interested in

127
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,640
any gossip about relationships.

128
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,840
This is probably the only quiet place

129
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,780
in Qingyao.

130
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,900
No wonder you are not late today.

131
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,240
You brought your boyfriend here.

132
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,820
Xibai.

133
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,100
He's not my boyfriend.

134
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:41,820
Quiet place?

135
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,500
Not anymore.

136
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,220
A heart

137
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,580
weighs about 260 grams.

138
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,460
Two thirds of it are on the left side of the body.

139
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,620
There are four heart chambers in total.

140
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,280
Left atrium, left ventricle,

141
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,620
Right atrium, and right ventricle.

142
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,140
This is the aorta.

143
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,900
This is pulmonary vein.

144
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,740
This is his first dissection class.

145
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:05,410
No matter how strong he is, he wouldn't handle it.

146
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,260
He'll embarrass himself later.

147
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,700
Take a look.

148
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,260
This is called superior vena cava.

149
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,420
This is called aorta, and this is a coronary sulcus.

150
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,100
This is the coronary sinus.

151
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,690
This is the apex of the heart.

152
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,700
Have you seen this before?

153
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,860
I'll cut it off and show you.

154
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,540
Please delete the photo.

155
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,140
Don't let anyone else see it.

156
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,780
That's easy.

157
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,740
If you sign your name on the Agreement of the Rumor Elimination Plan

158
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,620
and cooperate with me,

159
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,220
I will definitely delete it.

160
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,620
If you refuse to sign it,

161
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,140
I'll show others

162
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,860
the other side of a top student like you.

163
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,180
Scholar Lu, please.

164
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,260
As long as you promise to delete the photo,

165
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,860
I'll sign anything you want.

166
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,580
Lu Wanwan, focus please.

167
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,150
What I just said will definitely appear in the exams.

168
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,940
There will be a quiz in the anatomy class tomorrow.

169
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,020
If you fail,

170
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,860
don't tell anyone that you learned from me.

171
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,500
I'm sorry, Xibai.

172
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,910
What are you looking at?

173
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,270
I'm curious.

174
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,600
You're likely to be attracted by anything other than study.

175
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,540
We'll see. I'll make you sign it sooner or later.

176
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,240
Watch every structure of the heart.

177
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,680
Check every part.

178
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:53,910
Look.

179
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:59,580
This is the superior vena cava.

180
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,190
This is called aorta.

181
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:04,950
This...

182
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:05,950
Coronary sulcus.

183
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,270
How do you know?

184
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,800
I've prepared for the class.

185
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,410
This is called the apex of the heart.

186
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,470
You haven't seen it, have you?

187
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,020
I'll cut it off and show you.

188
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,310
You...

189
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,530
Don't you want to throw up?

00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,780
all feel nauseous in the first class.

192
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,220
You don't react at all.

193
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,540
Look at it carefully.

194
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,450
Feel something in your stomach.

195
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,190
Do you want to throw up your breakfast?

196
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,330
No.

197
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,260
It's just an anatomy class.

198
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,990
Why would I feel like vomiting?

199
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,470
Ren Chu, you're good. I told you.

200
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,350
You'll be fine once you have vomited before.

201
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,340
So you've vomited.

202
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,910
But it was not his fault.

203
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,560
Last time when we were having dinner in the lounge,

204
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,610
I randomly played a documentary

205
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:13,960
about the anatomy class.

206
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,930
It was indeed hard to accept

207
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,790
for those who are not of our major.

208
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,870
Well, it's truly pretty disgusting.

209
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,150
Xibai.

210
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,040
Didn't you film

211
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,510
such a classic scene?

212
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,060
I don't use phones.

213
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,510
But we can see the security footage.

214
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:38,740
Right.

215
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:43,360
The security footage must be better.

216
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:47,570
He'll have no choice but to sign the agreement when I get the...

217
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,960
Lu Wanwan, can you focus on your heart?

218
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,690
Your boyfriend doesn't have a heart on his face.

219
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:54,950
He's not my boyfriend.

220
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,170
What did you say?

221
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:58,640
The weather is nice.

222
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,370
It's a perfect day for anatomy.

223
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,490
I can see that

224
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,630
you have mastered the basic knowledge.

225
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,060
Not bad now.

226
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,970
But I can't do well in the anatomy class.

227
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,010
Why?

228
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,490
I'm nervous.

229
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,850
Anatomy class is a major course.

230
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:21,280
The two classes will take the course together.

231
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,540
The teacher will ask questions anytime.

232
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,820
I'd rather lie on the dissecting table

233
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,790
than answer questions in front of so many students.

234
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,470
The two classes will take the course together.

235
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,000
So An Jiaxian will come too.

236
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,600
So what?

237
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,590
I'm more interested in this course now.

238
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,830
Lu Wanwan, you can do it.

239
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,600
[Rehabilitation Classroom 02]

240
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,240
We'll have a quiz today.

241
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,920
According to your student ID number,

242
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,810
you will be divided into groups of three.

243
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,370
Students from Class 1 and Class 2 will be mixed randomly.

244
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,180
So don't think about cheating.

245
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,540
Let's see the group list.

246
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,850
Can I go to the restroom now?

247
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,130
What kind of weird group is this?

248
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:30,870
[Group 1 - Ren Chu, Lu Wanwan, An Jiaxian]

249
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,440
You're so unlucky.

250
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,330
Lu Wanwan.

251
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,810
Tell me

252
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,740
the function of atrioventricular delay in systole.

253
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,530
Function?

254
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,510
If...

255
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,630
When the ventricles contract at the atria...

256
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:12,240
Contraction... Because of the stimulation...

257
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,640
Stimulated... Contraction...

258
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:22,720
I've reviewed this question before. Take a deep breath.

259
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,100
Don't be nervous.

260
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,040
Blood flows...

261
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,040
The blood flows back from the ventricles to the atria.

262
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,710
Conduction activation

263
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,900
delays the atrioventricular node

264
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,420
by 120 to 150 milliseconds

265
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,430
to complete the contraction of the ventricles,

266
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,820
allowing the ventricles to collect as much blood

267
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,080
as possible.

268
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,770
Why did An Jiaxian answer the question for her again?

269
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:47,860
Who knows.

270
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,920
Isn't she already with Ren Chu?

271
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,650
Isn't it awkward? Dating with her ex and her current boyfriend at the same time?

272
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:54,910
Who asked him for help?

273
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,470
He's not helping.

274
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,070
All right, sit down.

275
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,050
Next question.

276
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,150
Please,

277
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:05,090
ask me another question.

278
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,210
Okay.

279
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,740
Can you tell me

280
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,420
cardiac structural and functional changes and related factors of heart disease

281
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,410
that may appear in patients with high blood pressure?

282
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,540
Patients with high blood pressure...

283
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,120
Patients with high blood pressure...

284
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,490
She must've been thinking about dating all the time.

285
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,890
She still can't answer this question.

286
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,810
Lu Wanwan, if you don't know the answer,

287
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:45,350
please stop wasting

288
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,950
our time here, OK?

289
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,550
Please, I know the answer.

290
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,750
I'm just a little nervous.

291
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,480
Patients with high blood pressure... Patients with high blood pressure...

292
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,080
Lu Wanwan.

293
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,470
I thought at least

294
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,740
you had a good attitude toward studying.

295
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,870
But why are you

296
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,510
pretending to know what you don't know now?

297
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,520
Are you spending more time

298
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,830
on your love life instead of studying?

299
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,530
Excuse me.

300
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,210
I have a question.

301
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,260
Go ahead.

302
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,150
How will the research on

303
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:22,650
hypertensive patients with diabetes

304
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:23,950
by using multilayer helical computerized tomography

305
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,090
affect the anatomy of the heart?

306
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,680
Although Ren Chu is just an auditor,

307
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,070
he asked a very interesting question.

308
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,860
Is there anyone who can answer this question?

309
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,080
This question is beyond the syllabus.

310
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,880
The relevant knowledge is clearly mentioned

311
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,740
at 7:45 of the heart documentary.

312
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,440
Did you get distracted while watching?

313
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,880
Sit down.

314
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,250
That's all for today.

315
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,550
Class dismissed.

316
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:19,470
Jiaxian.

317
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,369
What's wrong, Jiaxian?

318
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:23,930
Why are you in such a hurry?

319
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,560
Wanwan failed to answer the questions in the class.

320
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,960
She ran away in anger. I want to comfort her.

321
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:30,980
Stop it.

322
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,670
It's different now.

323
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,700
Everyone knows we're a couple now.

324
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,550
Sooner or later,

325
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:43,250
Wanwan will notice that she's not as close to us as before.

326
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,050
It'll be awkward

327
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,350
if the three of us are always together.

328
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,500
She wants to be alone.

329
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,600
Then give her some space.

330
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,380
Why are you here?

331
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,810
We're not supposed to be seen together.

332
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,320
I'm here to help you solve your problem.

333
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,790
You knew the answer to that question.

334
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,120
Why were you so nervous?

335
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,660
How do you know I know the answer?

336
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,410
Everyone else thinks I don't.

337
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,110
I don't care what others think of you.

338
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,330
I said you could do it.

339
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,080
But you still failed.

340
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,480
I don't like that.

341
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,900
I embarrassed myself.

342
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:30,580
Why are you upset?

343
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,100
That's weird.

344
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:34,990
You should leave now,

345
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,320
in case someone sees us.

346
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,460
Let's go outside the school.

347
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,050
Anywhere you want.

348
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,130
Don't say that.

349
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:49,730
It's so weird.

350
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,370
We can go out,

351
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,850
but we have to go separately.

352
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,030
Let's add each other on WeChat.

353
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,280
[Ren Chu]

354
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,020
So nice.

355
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,800
The oven is imported.

356
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,040
So comfortable.

357
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,140
If only I could have a sofa

358
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,310
in my Baking Club.

359
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,990
Then we don't have to sit on the floor.

360
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,450
The sofa is not expensive.

361
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:11,510
You're saying that

362
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,620
like you're saying the exam is not difficult.

363
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:17,340
The exam

364
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,160
is not difficult indeed.

365
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:21,770
Why do you always fail

366
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,970
the exam?

367
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,640
Judging from your performance today,

368
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,770
An Jiaxian could be part of the reason.

369
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,050
When I was in high school,

370
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,780
I really wanted to

371
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,050
go to the same university

372
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,890
and choose the same major with An Jiaxian.

373
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,310
But he's always been an excellent student.

374
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,910
I couldn't catch up with him.

375
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,430
So I've always felt extremely nervous

376
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,610
when taking exams.

377
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,050
I could easily be stressed out.

378
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,950
You've been admitted to Qingyao,

379
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,970
which means you are not bad.

380
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,450
Of course.

381
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,420
Actually, I know the answers.

382
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,430
The college entrance exam

383
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,230
was the only time I did my best.

384
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,660
I overcame the stress.

385
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:15,090
A straight A student like you

386
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,790
wouldn't understand my difficulties.

387
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,540
I asked you to cooperate

388
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,840
and sign the Rumor Elimination Plan.

389
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,060
But you refused it.

390
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,190
Or...

391
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,380
I'll go get the footage

392
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,390
of you vomiting in the lounge because of the anatomy video.

393
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,120
-Let's go back. -Let's go back.

394
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,250
Sorry, I'm just kidding.

395
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,760
I've got so many classes to take.

396
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,230
How could I possibly have time to get the footage?

397
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,630
Are you going to teach me a lesson at school?

398
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,090
I'll sign it.

399
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,560
You don't always carry it with you, do you?

400
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:00,450
Don't worry. I'll keep it a secret.

401
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,180
[Rumor Elimination Plan]

402
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,360
-Party A. -Party B.

403
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:12,710
First,

404
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:15,150
both parties should try their best to clarify the rumor

405
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,010
and announce the truth in public.

406
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,790
Second,

407
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:18,840
both parties should

408
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,110
try to avoid each other

409
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,540
and maintain absolute distance in public.

410
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,050
Both parties shouldn't show up at the same time.

411
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,020
If there's a need to meet,

412
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,160
both parties must meet at a secret place,

413
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,960
and in disguise when necessary.

414
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:30,520
Third,

415
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:32,070
due to Party A's rich experience,

416
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,370
Party A can provide

417
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:35,220
constructive guidance to Party B

418
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,310
and think of

419
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,290
three ways to eliminate the rumor.

420
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,400
Party B will be very cooperative.

421
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:42,910
How do you know I have rich experience?

422
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:45,130
You do have a reputation for such things.

423
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:45,930
Fourth,

424
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,860
whoever breaches the contract

425
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,920
will have to buy a human body model for the counterpart.

426
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,840
The details of compensation can be negotiated.

427
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:54,880
Sign it.

428
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,050
Wait.

429
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,390
Fifth,

430
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,670
From the day Party A and Party B sign the document,

431
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:13,150
Party B shall not mention in any way

432
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:16,550
about Party A vomiting in the lounge,

433
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:25,660
including any behavior that will damage Party A's reputation,

434
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,430
such as spreading the video, discussing it with others,

435
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:30,070
and leaving written records.

436
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:38,470
[Party B: Lu Wanwan]

437
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,100
[Party A: Ren Chu]

438
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,740
We are partners from now on.

439
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,470
Hope we can work well together.

440
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:01,490
Lu Wanwan.

441
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,460
What if you regret

442
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,190
and fall in love with me one day?

443
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,040
Impossible. If I fall in love with you,

444
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:12,040
I'll perform an appendectomy on myself and broadcast the surgery live.

445
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,180
Get up. It's cold sitting on the floor. You'll catch a cold.

446
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,400
There's really no place to sit.

447
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,500
Ren Chu signed it so quickly?

448
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:41,810
You didn't forge it, did you?

449
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,070
No.

450
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,380
Look. It's not my handwriting.

451
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:49,410
He did sign it himself.

452
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,850
But why did Ren Chu agree to sign it?

453
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,990
He has a bad temper and bossy behaviors.

454
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,210
That's so weird.

455
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,730
Could it be that he saw your classmates laugh at you

456
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,710
in the class,

457
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:01,840
so he decided to stand up to protect you?

458
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,350
No, he's just...

459
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,390
Anyway, don't call him bossy anymore.

460
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,110
He's a nice guy.

461
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:12,630
You started to call him bossy A student first.

462
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:14,020
I take it back.

463
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,400
Take it back?

464
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,510
Are you in love with Ren Chu?

465
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:19,770
You two

466
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,960
signed the document just now.

467
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,810
I just think

468
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:26,450
he is a good partner.

469
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,200
By the way, help me think.

470
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,330
What should I do first

471
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,760
to clarify the rumor?

472
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,410
Why don't you make a statement?

473
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,270
Celebrities do that all the time.

474
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,540
Ren Chu.

475
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,800
You're also here.

476
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,340
What a coincidence.

477
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,110
I see.

478
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,590
You guys can date here

479
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:01,560
without being noticed.

480
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,960
Xibai, I have nothing to do with him.

481
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,520
I believe it. I'm going to read the assignment.

482
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:28,230
I've made up my mind. You can make a statement,

483
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:30,080
saying that we can't be together for

484
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:30,920
our IQ is not on the same level.

485
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,880
It's all a misunderstanding.

486
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,140
Tell everyone to stop spreading rumors.

487
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,380
It's not convincing enough.

488
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,910
I'll definitely make a statement too,

489
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,430
saying that you're too excellent to be my boyfriend

490
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,160
and I'm not good enough for you.

491
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,130
Then we'll never meet again.

492
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:50,360
As time goes by, everyone will understand.

493
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,570
We're in the same school and the same class.t4

494
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,170
We sure will meet.

495
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:01,370
Then we can ignore each other.

496
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,390
Don't worry. I'm good at this.

497
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,790
Gossip spreads so fast.

498
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:15,560
They'll know soon enough.

499
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,360
Ren Chu,

500
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:24,010
do you regret it?

501
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,230
You signed the document.

502
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,630
The first term is to clarify our relationship.

503
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,580
I'll make the statement.

504
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:45,550
Did anyone else ask Xibai for help

505
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,310
besides me?

506
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,900
Cousin?

507
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,440
Sister-in-law, why are you here?

508
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,830
I'm not your sister-in-law.

509
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,170
Forget it.

510
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,640
Wait for the statement.

511
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,120
Are you waiting for Xibai?

512
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,570
I'm his girlfriend.

513
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,170
If I get fat,

514
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,160
I won't be able to handle Schrodinger's boyfriend.

515
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:40,700
Your boyfriend is Xibai?

516
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:41,700
No.

517
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:48,130
We've been wheeling. You've never been in a relationship.

518
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,260
What do you know?

519
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,020
The truth.

520
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,150
We'll see.

521
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:53,210
Xibai will be my boyfriend.

522
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:54,640
Sooner or later.

523
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,550
How did you get in?

524
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,990
Xibai.

525
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,180
Did you get a new security guard?

526
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,980
He asked for my ID all of a sudden.

527
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,170
Luckily, I have my cousin's student ID.

528
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:11,370
Otherwise, we wouldn't have met today.

529
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,560
I asked them to check the ID.

530
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,730
How could you do this to me?

531
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:20,550
Xibai, let me get you a phone

532
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,230
as your birthday gift, okay?

533
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:24,420
You don't have a phone or WeChat or QQ.

534
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,010
I can't contact you.

535
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,620
Do you really want me to throw the drift bottle?

536
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,970
I don't want to see you. I have classes to take.

537
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:33,190
I can be your assistant.

538
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,110
My silent mentor is inside.

539
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,490
Your mentor?

540
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,420
Then I should say hello.

00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:41,970
Silent mentor?

542
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,480
What a strange name.

543
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,370
Sounds interesting.

544
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:47,890
Silent mentor

545
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,500

Let's go.

547
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:01,330
Come down.

548
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,270
No. What is that? Take it away.

549
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,710
This is my silent mentor.

550
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,560
Please respect the deceased.

551
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,330
Don't vomit on me.

552
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,850
You can't throw up in the lab either.

553
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:40,980
I'm sorry. I'll clean it up.

554
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,500
No, you can go.

555
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,850
I'll do it myself.

556
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:17,230
What are you doing?

557
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,350
I'm cleaning the table.

558
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:20,540
Then

559
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,320
why do you lift your leg so high?

00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:33,780
Fine.

745
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,870
Why do I feel that he's not happy?

746
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:49,490
Does he think I'm too stupid?

747
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,200
I even need his help to find a boyfriend.

748
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:02,650
Why am I helping him wash clothes?

749
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:06,920
Fine. This will be the last time I do this.
