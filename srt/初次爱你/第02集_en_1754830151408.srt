1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,030
Wouldn't he see my naked body if we take a shower together?

3
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,110
Or I'm not even a girl

4
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,270
in his eyes?

5
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,470
With this body,

6
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,509
if he is going to do something bad to me,

7
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:51,670
I have no chance of fighting back.

8
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,870
Are you crazy, Lu Wanwan?

9
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,350
What are you thinking?

10
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,190
You cannot do anything illegal,

11
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,990
especially breaking the law for a bully like this.

12
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,150
Hurry up, I have no time to wait.

13
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,670
Don't you know how to hold back when you sneeze?

14
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,350
From a medical point of view,

15
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,630
it is not able to hold back sneezes or coughs.

16
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,390
So, I didn't do it on purpose.

17
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,190
Go take a shower.

18
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,790
You first.

19
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,550
Together.

20
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,910
Are you crazy?

21
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,310
Don't you know there are differences between male and female?

22
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,070
Why would I take a shower together with you?

23
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,579
You have constituted sexual harassment in this way.

24
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:45,750
I can sue you.

25
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,350
If you do not wish to take a shower, you can leave now.

26
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,610
However, don't blame me if you get a cold.

27
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,510
It's mine. Get it changed after the shower.

28
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,190
So embarrassing!

29
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,950
Why are you following me?

30
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,950
Didn't I told you that we can't be seen together,

31
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,990
so you had to come out 10 minutes later?

32
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:43,670
You are short.

33
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,110
You are a slow walker.

34
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,510
It's none of my business.

35
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,470
Look!

36
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,470
Isn't that Ren Chu and Lu Wanwan?

37
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,130
They are having a date, right?

38
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,950
They're dressing to match each other.

39
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,110
I can see Lu Wanwan is wearing a men-style jacket.

40
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,670
That is Ren Chu's, isn't it?

41
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,310
Can you leave me alone?

42
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,830
Isn't that Ren Chu?

43
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,510
So handsome!

44
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,710
Lu Wanwan is following behind him.

45
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,510
Why is she chasing after Ren Chu?

46
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,510
She is so brave.

47
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,790
Look, at our school,

48
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,990
who dares to follow Ren Chu all the time?

49
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,070
She is just crazy about love!

50
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,470
I have to say,

51
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,630
the power of love is really great.

52
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,150
There is no love,

53
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,310
but dignity.

54
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,440
I did not follow him!

55
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,710
I'll show you who is after whom.

56
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,790
Excuse me.

57
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,630
The class begins.

58
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,950
The results of

59
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,150
the last quiz are out.

60
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,590
Pass it on.

61
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,310
As a teacher,

62
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,909
I'm not saying you cannot be in a relationship.

63
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:50,070
But as a student,

64
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,420
you mustn't put the cart before the horse.

65
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,390
Especially you are studying medicine.

66
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,510
In the future,

67
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,990
you will have to deal with the most important life-threatening matters.

68
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:01,230
Don't neglect your studies

69
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:04,430
just because you fall in love with the school hunk.

70
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,670
I'm not even in a relationship.

71
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,870
What am I guilty of?

72
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:26,710
Miss Song.

73
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,030
Come, Ren Chu.

74
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,570
Sit over there.

75
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,870
I am hallucinating.

76
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,909
So handsome!

77
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,110
He...

78
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,670
He smiles at you. He smiles at me.

79
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,510
Keep quiet.

80
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,550
Ren Chu will be sitting in on our class in the future.

81
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,230
Now, get ready for the class.

82
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,310
Qiao.

83
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,550
Change the seats please.

84
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,550
Change the seats?

85
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:41,909
Lu Wanwan.

86
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,810
What's wrong with you?

87
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,950
Is there a nail on your chair?

88
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,010
Stop laughing.

89
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,590
Turn the page to page 108.

90
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,630
Chapter 11.

91
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,670
A thorn is at the back.

92
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,790
It's not much different from a nail.

93
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,470
What is this?

94
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,030
Social practice.

95
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,630
The result of social practice serves as a reference for postgraduate recommendation.

96
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,150
It won't affect you.

97
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:18,860
Of course,

98
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,150
the social practice in our school is mainly

99
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,590
to give tutoring lessons

100
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,390
to the children in the orphanage.

101
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,470
It is not suitable for you.

102
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,070
It will already be considered pretty good if it doesn't cause extra damage

103
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,630
because of your contemptuous eyes.

104
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,090
Who dares to let you tutor?

105
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,030
I want to re-do social practice.

106
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,590
I don't accept failing.

107
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,190
What if you just forget it?

108
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,309
You don't even know how to smile.

109
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:36,150
What if you cause childhood trauma

110
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,830
on the children of our country?

111
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:38,890
I know how to smile.

112
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,950
Then smile for me now.

113
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,150
Some other day then.

114
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,680
Which day is some other day?

115
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,030
If you really want to go for it,

116
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,310
go outside of the school more often on weekends.

117
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,670
Communicate more with strangers.

118
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,070
Try to blend in with them.

119
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,750
Oh hell.

120
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,590
I don't know if there is something wrong with my optic nerve,

121
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,150
or his mouth is twitching so badly that

122
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,480
it is the time for him to see a neurologist.

123
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,030
Alright, the class ends here today.

124
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,590
The class is over now.

125
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,230
Are you not going to join us for the evening self-study class?

126
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,630
No, I'm not going to join.

127
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,930
I need to hide for a bit.

128
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,310
Mum.

129
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,710
Wanwan is home!

130
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,150
Do you want some oranges? They've just arrived.

131
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,350
I'll peel one for you.

132
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:23,190
An Jiaxian came home together with you, right?

133
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,950
Today's pears are very sweet.

134
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,030
Go ask him to come over

135
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,690
and take some back for his mum.

136
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,830
Here.

137
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,750
I don't want to.

138
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,200
I don't know if he is back or not.

139
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,750
Your dad and I are open-minded.

140
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,870
You are childhood sweethearts.

141
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,830
It is good that you are with each other.

142
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,110
We won't object.

143
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,510
Mum!

144
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,070
How could I be with An Jiaxian?

145
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,430
He has a girlfriend already.

146
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,880
He is in a relationship?

147
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,150
It's fine.

148
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,030
Actually, I've long thought that

149
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,630
the two of you aren't compatible.

150
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,590
He is indecisive.

151
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:08,190
I just saw him take care of you all the time.

152
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,270
That's why I thought he is barely worthy of you.

153
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,390
You are too good.

154
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,190
Let's hug.

155
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:23,790
Wanwan is back!

156
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,070
Great.

157
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,430
I'm going to do some grocery shopping.

158
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:29,470
I'm going to make a big meal for my daughter.

159
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,670
Please cook the rice.

160
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,010
I'm going to cook the rice.

161
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,630
I need to hurry up and cheer up

162
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,750
to sell you all!

163
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,190
Hello, how much is this pear?

164
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,750
I am off-campus. What am I avoiding?

165
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,350
Also, this is my house.

166
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,410
What am I afraid of?

167
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,390
Why are you coming here?

168
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,950
Send some fruits to our club members.

169
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:43,590
Your fruit store

170
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,320
has the highest rating online.

171
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,470
You are going to send fruits to others

172
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,630
out of nowhere?

173
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,270
I am trying to be friendly.

174
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,550
I have problems with my social practice subject.

175
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,750
The teaching assistant asks me to practise to be friendly.

176
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,750
Did you fail the subject?

177
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,750
Not really.

178
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,950
How much did you get?

179
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:10,830
59.

180
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,610
What subject did you fail?

181
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,650
Social practice subject.

182
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,790
Then why do you come to our clinical department class?

183
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,270
I am considering a postgraduate program

184
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,270
in computer science and technology.

185
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,750
The topic is the human action recognition of artificial intelligence.

186
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,030
It is required to study the correlation between artificial intelligence,

187
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,090
human structure and nervous system.

188
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,310
I want to study some related knowledge.

189
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:40,470
How about you go to the second class of the clinical department?

190
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:43,390
The quality of their students is higher than that of ours.

191
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,590
It's suitable for you.

192
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,910
The second class of the clinical department...

193
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,910
An Jiaxian got the best grade there.

194
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,830
What day is today?

195
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,950
Ren Chu?

196
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,270
Why are you here?

197
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,950
Did you see Lu Wanwan?

198
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,430
This is her house.

199
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,270
Wanwan.

200
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,120
I've been looking for you everywhere.

201
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,240
I want to treat you to a meal.

202
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,510
It was my bad that day

203
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,130
at the restaurant.

204
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,550
I left you alone.

205
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,310
I'm sorry.

206
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,190
Thanks to you for persuading me that day,

207
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,790
I have made up with Liang Xia.

208
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,230
I'm not going.

209
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,160
I'm good as long as you two are good.

210
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,350
You don't have to apologize to me, either.

211
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,910
There is nothing between us.

212
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,570
Your dinner with Liang Xia...

213
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,310
Strangers.

214
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,070
I will go.

215
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,670
That's alright.

216
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,910
Liang Xia has already reserved a table at the restaurant anyways.

217
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:10,550
Very good.

218
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,030
No!

219
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:16,310
He must've heard the drunken gibberish

220
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,750
in the bathroom that day.

221
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,080
What if he spread it out?

222
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,030
Wait a minute.

223
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,630
I will go too.

224
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,630
Congratulations on getting back together.

225
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,710
Wanwan.

226
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,310
This must be Ren Chu, right?

227
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,550
It is the first time I've seen you in person.

228
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,430
Yes.

229
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,910
You are quite famous.

230
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:04,670
However,

231
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,470
Wanwan,

232
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,830
are you really not mad at me?

233
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:10,590
Really.

234
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,790
I'm really not mad at you.

235
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:17,030
What Liang Xia worried about the most is that you will be unhappy.

236
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,950
Actually,

237
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,550
she cares a lot about you as her best friend.

238
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:22,870
Anyways,

239
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:24,830
it is our fault to hide it from you.

240
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,960
We officially apologize to you today.

241
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:28,910
Cheers.

242
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,850
I wish both of you the best.

243
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,230
Yes.

244
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,470
Don't bully Liang Xia, okay?

245
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,070
Don't bring me soy milk anymore, either,

246
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,530
so as not to be misleading.

247
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,060
That's right.

248
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,270
Is it that Ren Chu would misunderstand?

249
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,430
Wanwan.

250
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,510
The gossip about

251
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,230
you and Ren Chu

252
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,270
is real?

253
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:03,910
Yes.

254
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,510
You are together?

255
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,030
Since when?

256
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:07,950
No.

257
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:10,119
What are you talking about?

258
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,170
I take back what I said.

259
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,670
Eat more; talk less.

260
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,270
Let's eat.

261
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,500
Try this.

262
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,430
I know it's a test.

263
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,630
This is reciprocity.

264
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:48,900
Eat more.

265
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:51,270
With Ren Chu around,

266
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,190
you don't have to do much.

267
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,850
You are embarrassing.

268
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,590
Wanwan.

269
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,630
Since you want to pursue a school hunk,

270
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,760
you need to learn to dress yourself up.

271
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,750
This lipstick is brand new.

272
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,030
It's for you.

273
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,470
I remember when we used to hang out together,

274
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,550
we also liked to

275
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:25,450
put two or three lipsticks in the bag.

276
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:27,710
It is the same now.

277
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,270
Yes.

278
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,070
At that time, because I just transferred to the place,

279
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,000
I was sidelined by the other girls.

280
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,150
Thanks to you.

281
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,230
Fortunately those days are over.

282
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,470
By the way, Wanwan,

283
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,710
when I heard about you and Ren Chu,

284
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,870
I'm so happy for you.

285
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,670
Ren Chu

286
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:53,200
is the most outstanding person in our school.

287
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,430
I...

288
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:57,830
Wanwan,

289
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,150
later on,

290
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:01,750
the four of us can hang out together more often.

291
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,030
You're so innocent,

292
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,990
we will have a look for you

293
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:07,850
to prevent you from getting hurt.

294
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,070
Oh no!

295
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,070
I must be stupid.

296
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,230
You must've liked Ren Chu

297
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,590
a long time ago, right?

298
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,990
You have vision and courage.

299
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:26,470
I've heard that there are so many people in the school who like him

300
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,130
but no one dares to pursue him.

301
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,950
You're not stupid!

302
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:36,570
You knew clearly how much I liked An Jiaxian,

303
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,960
yet you've professed to him

304
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,310
and kept it from me for two years!

305
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:42,990
I'm the big fool

306
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,950
you're playing around with.

307
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:49,430
I...

308
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:53,950
Liang Xia.

309
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,830
I see you as my best friend,

310
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,320
that's why I don't mind.

311
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,150
But it doesn't mean

312
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,230
I accept it,

313
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,150
or I'm not sad.

314
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,670
Enough is enough.

315
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:15,990
Wanwan.

316
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,700
Wanwan.

317
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,150
Let's go.

318
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:42,830
Are you feeling cold?

319
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,590
A little bit.

320
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,230
Put my coat on.

321
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,790
I'm doing okay today, right?

322
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,270
Is my smile normal?

323
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,590
Children should be able

324
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,910
to accept it.

325
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,190
I was distracted

326
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:15,270
for a little while.

327
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,310
It shouldn't be too obvious.

328
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,110
Thank you.

329
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:22,830
You can go back first.

330
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,630
Alright, I got it.

331
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,490
What are you doing?

332
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,230
Don't look at it if you don't like it.

333
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:36,830
Go home.

334
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,110
Get me down!

335
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,390
Excuse me.

336
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,710
Thank you, Ren Chu.

337
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,020
Lu Wanwan,

338
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,790
how can you be so heavy as a girl?

339
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,030
I'm so much lighter than your barbell.

340
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,030
Get me down.

341
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,190
Quickly.

342
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,790
Wanwan, have you checked your WeChat Moments?

343
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,920
An Jiaxian shows affection in public.

344
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:08,070
When I saw the three of you guys hanging out together,

345
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,590
I thought Liang Xia was weird.

346
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,310
I asked you to pay more attention

347
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,510
but you just didn't listen

348
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,780
and said things about pure friendship.

349
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,550
Can there be pure friendship between males and females?

350
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,990
You and An Jiaxian weren't even pure,

351
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,710
but you still expected her to be pure.

352
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:19,390
There are so many people out there but she doesn't like.

353
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,110
She wants to like the person that her best friend likes.

354
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,550
Don't associate with them in the future anymore.

355
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,150
The photo looks disgusting.

356
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:32,990
Don't worry.

357
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:33,990
I'll look ahead.

358
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,600
I'll completely forget about An Jiaxian.

359
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,430
Is that Lu Wanwan?

360
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:17,470
It's the first time I've seen her in person.

361
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:19,270
She's just average.

362
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,310
Just average?

363
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,130
I think I look better than you.

364
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,070
Why is he here?

365
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:46,550
Why didn't I notice?

366
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:55,350
Aren't Ren Chu and Lu Wanwan in a relationship?

367
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,080
Why do they sit separately?

368
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,830
They must've had a fight.

369
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,720
It's the silent treatment.

370
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,470
Why are you here?

371
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:24,870
It's obvious.

372
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:25,800
I'm eating here.

373
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,070
Fair enough.

374
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,270
I've made a cake for you

375
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:05,630
to thank you for saving me from embarrassment.

376
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:08,670
After that, there'll be nothing between us.

377
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,470
Give me your address,

378
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,550
I'll send the cake over to you.

379
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,950
Ren Chu, can we share the table with you?

380
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,950
There aren't any seats left.

381
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,870
There are seats available here.

382
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,630
They are so brave to

383
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,030
sit next to Ren Chu's girlfriend.

384
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,110
That's right.

385
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,230
So brave.

386
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:09,070
Sit.

387
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:09,830
Thank you.

388
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,110
Thank you.

389
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,280
Ren Chu, this is your notebook.

390
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:24,510
Lu Wanwan says she's made a cake for you.

391
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,910
A cake?

392
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,830
Why don't you just send it to me via WeChat?

393
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,360
I don't have your WeChat ID.

394
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,950
I'm not adding your WeChat.

395
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,010
Don't get me wrong.

396
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,430
I'll ask Fan Yi to send you the address.

397
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:46,400
Why don't you let me know directly?

398
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,480
To avoid suspicion.

399
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,030
Senior,

400
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,200
is the location you gave accurate?

401
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,870
I think I'm in a KTV bar now.

402
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,510
That's right.

403
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,150
Here!

404
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:12,790
Here!

405
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,630
Today we are here to give encouragements for Ren Chu's postgraduate recommendation.

406
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,110
Even though he doesn't need any encouragement,

407
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,990
we need a chance to eat and drink.

408
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:19,790
Since you're here,

409
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,470
come join us!

410
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,190
That's fine. I'm just here to send the cake.

411
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,510
The others aren't here yet.

412
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,510
Since you're here, sing a song then.

413
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:26,990
Only one.

414
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:28,990
Let's go! No, it's fine.

415
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:29,710
Let's go!

416
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:59,710
My horseman, you're mighty and full of power and grandeur.

417
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:04,750
The rushing steed is cutting through the wind like lightning.

418
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:10,430
My horseman, you're on my mind.

419
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:14,350
It's my desire to be drawn into your embrace.

420
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,550
Lu Wanwan.

421
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:20,950
I didn't expect you to sing in such a rough style

422
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,350
while you look

423
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,680
so delicate and pretty.

424
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,230
Senior. Come here!

425
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,670
Lu Wanwan is indeed here.

426
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:29,270
Yi Feng,

427
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,750
I told you we would have cake to eat, right?

428
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:31,750
Come, take a seat.

429
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,710
Senior. Does the whole school know that

430
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,180
I made a cake for him?

431
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,350
Bro, are you tired?

432
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,010
No, I'm not.

433
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:37,700
No.

434
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,070
Where is Ren Chu?

435
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,200
Aren't you supposed to come together?

436
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,070
Wait for me.

437
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,470
Such a high heel!

438
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,310
They are that close.

439
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,790
Is she the real girlfriend?

440
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:54,350
Oops!

441
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,430
Could it be that she heard the scandal

442
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,870
and came to catch the mistress?

443
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:58,390
Ren Chu, how come you just came?

444
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,910
Do you know what I've experienced?

445
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,190
Lu Wanwan, she...

446
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,530
Where is Lu Wanwan?

447
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:23,230
Does the legendary Lu Wanwan also come?

448
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:34,270
They can't see me...

449
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:37,070
Are you squatting here to pretend to be a mushroom?

450
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:51,790
Come here.

451
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,550
Don't be shy.

452
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,430
Is it you?

453
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,390
You're lying!

454
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:31,470
It must be you.

455
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:35,630
It's really not me. You've got the wrong person.

456
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,630
I'm not a mistress! Sister-in-law!

457
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,070
What?

458
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,230
Let me introduce.

459
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,150
This is my cousin, Wang Xinyu.

460
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,910
Hello, sister-in-law.

461
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,950
I'm from the dance academy next door.

462
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,710
I heard that my cousin, Ren Chu is in a relationship.

463
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:54,590
That's why I'm here to have a look to know

464
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,710
what kind of girl can make him fall for her.

465
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:58,470
Today, I finally get to see you.

466
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,150
Hello.

467
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,870
I'm not your sister-in-law.

468
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,070
So cute!

469
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:10,470
Tell me how do you get to know each other.

470
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:12,200
Is it the same as it said online?

471
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,990
Let's take a photo together.

472
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,070
Let's do it.

473
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,470
Two One.

474
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:03,030
Why did you leave?

475
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,330
It's too noisy.

476
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:06,890
It's better to go home and do some exercises.

477
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:15,610
Did you wash your hair?

478
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,030
No.

479
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,370
The hair is quite oily.

480
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:23,630
You must know how to drive, right?

481
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,429
I have drunk alcohol.

482
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:25,750
Drive me back later.

483
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:28,929
When did you drink?

484
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,389
The Wine Cherry Cake.

485
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:34,270
Calculated according to the volatilisation system of alcohol concentration,

486
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:36,590
the alcohol content in my body is 25 mg.

487
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:39,790
I'm already counted as I've drunk alcohol.

488
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,550
So strict.

489
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:45,090
As expected of a math student.

490
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,630
I have to declare that

491
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:50,710
I learned to drive during the summer vacation after Gaokao.

492
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,840
Since then, I haven't driven anymore.

493
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,710
Do you have car insurance?

494
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:01,990
Is it left foot or right foot for the gas pedal?

495
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:03,990
One leg.

496
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:12,390
Lu Wanwan,

497
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:15,070
you really washed your hair today, right?

498
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,190
I'm a good young person.

499
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,670
So what's wrong with

500
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:20,730
me washing my hair?

501
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,670
I didn't wash it to see you.

502
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:25,910
Can't we talk about something else?

503
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,680
Lu Wanwan, you really don't sing well.

504
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:32,630
Does your family know

505
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,230
you have such a sharp tongue?

506
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,810
Would they feel safe to let you out alone?

507
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:42,670
I'd say, if you're like this,

508
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:45,230
you'll never pass the social practice exam?

509
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:47,110
I've passed the make-up exam.

510
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,110
By the way,

511
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:51,670
thank you for the sweets.

512
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,350
It helped me out

513
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:54,590
at critical moments.

514
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,350
Of course,

515
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,610
I make the best things.

516
00:35:58,870 --> 00:35:59,910
However,

517
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:02,830
are you going to stop being nice with people?

518
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,590
A person's energy is limited.

519
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,750
Kindness, gentleness and patience

520
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,630
are reserved only for true friends.

521
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:13,990
The rest can only be ordinary classmates or passers-by.

522
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:15,990
No need to waste both parties' time.

523
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,510
Watch out!

524
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,710
So, we're ordinary classmates, right?

525
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,430
Of course.

526
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:32,850
You're an ordinary classmate that makes good dessert.

527
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,070
I calculated the time.

528
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,230
You could make it

529
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,030
if you have driven normally.

530
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,430
But you drove too slowly.

531
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:57,030
You didn't do it on purpose, did you?

532
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,150
If only

533
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:59,240
I left you behind

534
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,480
and came back alone!

535
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:15,590
Lu Wanwan.

536
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,030
What are you doing?

537
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:23,750
I was checking the door lock's security.

538
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:25,870
You've dated until this hour?

539
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:26,870
Pay attention next time.

540
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,310
Come in.

541
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:29,750
I'll open the door for you.

542
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:30,350
Come in.

543
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:31,590
Thank you, miss.

544
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,510
You didn't call her earlier

545
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,510
when you know her number.

546
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,910
You didn't ask me either.

547
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,450
There's nothing more between us.

548
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:45,270
Hurry up.

549
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:46,670
Thank you, miss.

550
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,590
It's so late!

551
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,310
Why do you just come back?

552
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:58,470
I thought you were going to stay out all night.

553
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:00,150
I've made up a reason for you just now,

554
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:02,790
when the dormitory teacher checked the dormitory.

555
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:04,850
Where could I go if I didn't come back?

556
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,070
I'll go to sleep.

557
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:15,750
Wanwan,

558
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:16,550
when are the four of us

559
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:18,150
going for a date?

560
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:19,950
Or we don't bring our boyfriends.

561
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:22,190
Just two of us.

562
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,730
I treat you to the meal.

563
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:28,350
A person's energy is limited.

564
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:31,270
Kindness, gentleness and patience

565
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:32,910
are reserved only for true friends.

566
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:36,040
The rest can only be ordinary classmates or passers-by.

567
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,180
No need to waste both parties' time.

568
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,070
Liang Xia,

569
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:52,230
the blessing I have for you and An Jiaxian is true,

570
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:55,430
but it is also true that I don't want to see your public display of affection.

571
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:56,670
I still have to study,

572
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:57,950
to make dessert,

573
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,390
and to make new friends.

574
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:00,830
I'm very busy.

575
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:03,390
I have limited ability and smiles.

576
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:04,830
Sorry.

577
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:07,770
Let's be ordinary classmates afterwards then.

578
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:10,430
Alright, come over.

579
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,430
Come over.

580
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,630
Lu Wanwan and you left the earliest.

581
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:23,070
Why are you coming back at this time?

582
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,460
We took some detours.

583
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,310
If you are not interested in Lu Wanwan,

584
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:32,190
you should clear up the scandal as soon as possible.

585
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,870
I see that girl

586
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:35,990
is very worried all day long.

587
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:37,120
So, don't tease her.

588
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:40,350
Too bad.

589
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:43,350
What is too bad?

590
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:46,670
Singing.

591
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:48,590
Riding.

592
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:50,230
Climbing.

593
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,150
Are you sending a telegram?

594
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,950
Can you say it in a full sentence?

595
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:16,630
Wanwan.

596
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:18,510
Why are you still sleeping?

597
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,790
Something huge has happened, Wanwan!

598
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:20,870
Wake up!

599
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:21,870
Wake up!

600
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,670
What's wrong?

601
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:26,020
This morning, I went to the English corner for morning reading.

602
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,670
It is spread among the classmates that

603
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:30,470
you and Ren Chu spent the night outside last night.

604
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,440
What did you say?

605
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,690
Where did you hear it from?

606
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:37,430
Not sure who heard it from the dormitory teacher saying that

607
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:39,710
it was Ren Chu who sent you back in the middle of the night last night.

608
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,150
It has been spreading.

609
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:43,310
It has been embellished to be what it is now.

610
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:44,590
Spending the night outside

611
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:46,870
is more serious than the confession before.

612
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,750
Not only that.

613
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,470
Ren Chu came to our class to sit in on our class.

614
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:52,070
You will see each other

615
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:53,790
more often.

616
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,550
Why don't you repeat your grade

617
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,430
since your grades are not very good anyway?

618
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:58,990
Or I'll kill you now.

619
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:04,590
What now?

620
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,670
Not that serious yet!

621
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:12,470
No!

622
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,310
Calm down.

623
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:14,950
How can I calm down?

624
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,790
Things have become so bad that

625
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:18,920
they have seriously affected my life.

626
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,110
If I go out now,

627
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:22,110
there will be people pointing at me,

628
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:23,310
mumbling.

629
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:24,150
Some are so loud that

630
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:26,950
it is almost like shouting in my ear with a trumpet.

631
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:30,510
I can't even pretend that I don't see and hear them.

632
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:46,960
If a soft way can't work out,

633
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,030
do it in a hard way.

634
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:15,700
Lu Wanwan,

635
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,030
what are you going to do?

636
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:27,390
Scandal Elimination Plan.

637
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:28,950
Just sign it.
