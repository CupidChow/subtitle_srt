00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,950
when can we play together again?

7
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,670
You disappeared when there was a power cut last time.

8
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,480
I was looking for you everywhere. I was worried.

00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,160
You don't look happy.

Do you know about love?

14

It's not a big deal.

15
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,750
It's a piece of cake for me.

16
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,880
The most important thing in love is to find the most suitable remedy.

Every girl has a different temper.

Sometimes she also goes to the enemy's area to steal something.

If I knew he was so noisy,

I would have come out with Xibai.

My idea is not bad, right?

I saw a mother and her son walking on the road,

89
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,630
and they're connected by this.

90
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,510
So, I got a batch of it.

In our place,

107
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,590
we'll be given the password and remove this bracelet.

Tie him up and get him here if he doesn't want to.

Ren Chu went to the lab.

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,990
such a childish thing.

190
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,830
What kind of mission

191
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,280
can only be done by tying two people together?

192
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,710
It's quite childish.

193
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,160
That day...

194
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,150
I'm sorry.

195
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,720
For what?

196
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:29,950
Anyway,

197
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,520
I was rude.

198
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,470
I shouldn't have yelled at you

199
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,120
or

200
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,000
forced my will on you.

201
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,870
I shouldn't

202
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,520
have thought the clinical department as myself.

203
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,270
I also have a gift for you.

204
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,560
A gift?

205
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720
Ren Chu,

206
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,000
it's easy to apologize.

207
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,640
But after that,

208
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,440
Alpha and Beta are no longer friends.

209
00:10:59,190 --> 00:10:59,880
So,

210
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,400
you have to take this opportunity

211
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,790
to deepen the relationship between Alpha and Beta and

212
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,670
take their relationship

213
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,110
to the next level.

214
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,160
Go on.

215
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,430
How to achieve that?

216
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:16,430
Raise a life together.

217
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,870
I mean, raise a pet together.

218
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,950
Don't interpret it wrong, okay?

219
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,440
Where are you going?

220
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,960
Bird and Flower Market.

221
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,520
The holiday is coming.

222
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,120
I'm giving you a pet in case you're bored.

223
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,360
It's okay if you don't know how to take care of it.

224
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,270
I can take care of it with you.

225
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,910
We can be the guardians of our pet together.

226
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,440
What is it?

227
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,670
Dog? Kitten?

228
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,120
Better not be a rabbit.

229
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,910
Although I like rabbits very much,

230
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,510
we medical students

231
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,030
may have a conditional reflex.

232
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,830
When I see it...

233
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,310
A turtle?

234
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,430
Actually, it's a tortoise.

235
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,560
Do you like it?

236
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,430
Yes,

237
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,430
but it's quite special.

238
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,310
It's the first time someone gave me a...

239
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,990
A tortoise.

240
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,670
Tortoises can live a long life,

241
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,040
so that

242
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,870
we can be its guardians

243
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,590
longer.

244
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,000
Longer?

245
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,310
That's right.

246
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,870
If I take good care of it,

247
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,680
who knows which one of us will leave this world first.

248
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,560
I'll take good care of it.

249
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,240
We'll get closer in the future.

250
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,200
Wanwan.

251
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,720
Your cake is ready.

252
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,510
I'll give it to you.

253
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,550
Thank you.

254
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,910
Long time no see, Ren Chu.

255
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,960
The result of Alpha and Beta

256
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,550
hasnâ€™t been deduced yet.

257
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,120
Why is there another Gamma?

258
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:17,990
Let me show you.

259
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:19,800
Is this Gamma

260
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,230
more important than the tortoise?

261
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,760
You're quite skillful, Wanwan.

262
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:29,630
By then,

263
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,710
you can put the candle in the middle.

264
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,870
Looking is not enough.

265
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,630
Taste it.

266
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,950
I've been making this for three hours,

267
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:41,920
and you just put a fork in it?!

268
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,720
My hand slipped.

269
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,560
Slipped?

270
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,870
Did the cake do it to itself?

271
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,280
Forget it.

272
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,760
Ren Chu didn't mean it.

273
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:50,720
See if it can be repaired, Wanwan.

274
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,720
Ren Chu,

275
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,070
why aren't you replying?

276
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,320
Many people came to consult

277
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,320
about our club.

278
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,990
Is our club still recruiting at the end of this semester?

279
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,110
Get back to your work.

280
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,590
Don't be a nuisance here.

281
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,630
I'll be right back.

282
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,470
Wait for me.

283
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,040
You're its guardian now,

284
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,240
so you must be responsible for it and for me.

285
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,470
Let me do it.

286
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,080
Leave this kind of rough work to me.

287
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,480
Something is wrong with this bottle.

288
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,430
It's so tight.

289
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,440
Do you want me to open it for you?

290
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,680
No need.

291
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,000
There's a time machine exhibition area ahead.

292
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,910
Let's play ring-toss.

293
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:55,910
Let's go.

294
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,520
[Happy Shooting]

295
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,560
Darts.

296
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,880
You know what?

297
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,120
I'm so good at throwing darts. I can hit all of the targets.

298
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,750
Did you see that white bear?

299
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,350
Do you want it?

300
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,550
It's my showtime.

301
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,440
Nice! You did hit the goal.

302
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,550
The darts didn't miss.

303
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:39,960
But...

304
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:42,040
Will they ask us to pay for the white bear?

305
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,630
Let's go.

306
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,550
Ring-toss.

307
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,710
I'm really good at it.

308
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,680
It's a skill passed down by ancestors of the Fan family.

309
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,070
The white bear was too big.

310
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:52,910
I'm afraid it's hard for you to hold it.

311
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,680
This time, I'll get you a little Corgi.

312
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,360
This is too hard.

313
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,350
It doesn't make sense.

314
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,360
It's really hard.

315
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,600
I just wanted to take the rabbit in front of it,

316
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,520
but I didn't expect to get this.

317
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,230
Thank you.

318
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,080
Take it.

319
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:34,310
It's okay.

320
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,440
I like taking care of people.

321
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:38,310
Well,

322
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,320
can you get me the candy over there?

323
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,230
Ren Chu,

324
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,040
it's almost winter break.

325
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,750
What's the training schedule for our swimming club?

326
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,310
Self-training.

327
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,240
How long should I train every week?

328
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,320
It depends on yourself.

329
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:55,550
Ren Chu,

330
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,480
what about the next semester?

331
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,000
I have many classes next semester.

332
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,470
I'm afraid I won't have enough time for training.

333
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,040
In that case,

334
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:05,550
I might have to put my study first.

335
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,800
Are you happier than being with me?

336
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,560
No!

337
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,150
Of course I'm happy when being with you.

338
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,109
Senior He,

339
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:14,520
I want to join the swimming club now.

340
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,960
Please give me the registration form.

341
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,119
Okay, fill in the form.

342
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,350
How dare he touch my son?

343
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,790
I should've tied her up earlier.

344
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,960
Ren Chu!

345
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,000
Ren Chu,

346
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,590
I finally caught you.

347
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,200
When I saw this mission,

348
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,710
I thought of you first.

349
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,190
Let's accomplish it together.

350
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,240
I was worried other people

351
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,640
would tie you up first.

352
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,550
Thank goodness.

353
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,000
You're mine now.

354
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,920
We didn't enjoy enough fun last time.

355
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,680
We can do our best now.

356
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,910
One, two, three, four.

357
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,350
Dear Xibai,

358
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,830
I thought you were in the lab.

359
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,470
I was thinking about convincing you to go on a date.

360
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,720
You want to play this?

361
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,640
I'm an artist.

362
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,230
I'm good at singing.

363
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,070
This design is amazing.

364
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,030
I really want to tie you up forever.

365
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:00,950
Xibai,

366
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,030
why donâ€™t you resist it?

367
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:04,800
You should say,

368
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,320
"No, I don't want it."

369
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,030
They're not as good as you used to be.

370
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,800
Are you still angry

371
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,920
because of the final exam?

372
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,630
I'm sorry.

373
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,350
I didn't mean to lie to you.

374
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,200
Actually, I don't think I'm suitable for dancing.

375
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,520
I've talked to your head teacher.

376

You said you didn't like clinical department,

I know.

You just don't want to repeat the same mistake.

663
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,750
You need more time

00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,480
to acknowledge your feelings.

666
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,870

I'll leave first.

668
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,680
What's wrong?

669
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:31,110
She was talking about the clinical department, not Ren Chu.

670
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,680
Why do I feel guilty?

671
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,270
Did I say those words sincerely?

672
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,590
No.

673
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,160
What?

674
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,840
Are you laughing at me too?

675
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,160
This question is simple.

676
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,040
Just use the Coulomb law.

677
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:01,920
It's obvious.

678
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,830
The interaction between two stationary point

679
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:05,280

680
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:12,230
You're from the science department, right?

681
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,560
I have something to ask you.

682
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,190
What is magnetic flux?

683
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:19,920
This is simple.

684
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,680
Suppose that in a uniform magnetic field

685
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,750
with the magnetic induction of B,

686
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:24,270
there is a plane with the area of S perpendicular

687
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:26,510
to the direction of the magnetic field,

688
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:29,070
the product of magnetic induction of B

689
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:31,320
and area of S is called the magnetic flux through this plane.

690
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,160
Do you understand?

691
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,280
In an ordinary way,

692
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:36,800
the magnetic flux is defined by

693
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,750
the integral of the magnetic field over the surface area,

694
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,000
and the formula is

695
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,920
Î¦=BÂ·SÂ·cosÎ¸.

696
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,440
Junior,

697
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:48,870
why do you ask about this?

698
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,440
A friend of mine

699
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:52,790
praised me like that.

700
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,430

try to change this formula.

702
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,320
He might not be praising you.

703
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,390
He wasn't praising me?

704
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,160
He betrayed my sincere heart!
