[First Love]

00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:37,990
[Episode 6]

4
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,550
Does this outfit match?

5
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,979
Will Xibai like it?

6
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,620
What do you think, cousin?

7
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,950
Do you think it matches?

8
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:50,979
Cousin!

9
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:52,979
It does match.

10
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,240
It does. It does...

11
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,440
Why do I feel like you're cursing?

12
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,420
Your outfit today is quite

13
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,290
different from what you usually wear.

14
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,540
You don't understand.

15
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,740
Xibai said he likes demure girls.

16
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,900
So I decided to change my style.

17
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,940
From now on,

18
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,940
I'll be quiet and gentle.

19
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,980
But as busy as you usually are,

20
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,980
you should have not refused my demind

21
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,710
and have come shopping with me.

22
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,900
Are you planning to ask me a favor in return?

23
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,290
Xibai would not like this.

24
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,350
It's too childish.

25
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,380
Xinyu,

26
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,260
if you are

27
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,500
kissed by someone you know,

28
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,940
what would you think?

29
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,620
Did you... in the infirmary...

30
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,210
see me and Xibai?

31
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,140
How was it?

32
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,940
Did the scene look beautiful?

33
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,000
Was it like a scene from an idol drama?

34
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,200
What do you think then?

35
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,260
What else could I think?

36
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,640
Of course I'm more than happy.

37
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,740
Xibai is so cute.

38
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,540
I will marry him one day.

39
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,220
Then we'll have two children within three years.

40
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,860
They will be named

41
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,660
Meng Xin

42
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,490
and Meng Yu.

43
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,340
Oh my!

44
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,020
It'd be so cute!

45
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,300
Get changed

46
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,460
and marry Xibai.

47
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,620
So kissing

48
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,960
means two people are already together.

49
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,660
It's just a self-study session. Why do dress yourself up so nicely?

50
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,740
People would think you're going on a date.

51
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,980
I am going on a date.

52
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,300
You call doing exercises a date?

53
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,760
The standards of being a top student have been elevated again.

54
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,610
Lu Wanwan, have you finished your homework?

55
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,210
Do you want to do it together?

56
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,150
Wanwan, let's do the exercises together.

57
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,400
Wanwan, do the exercises with me.

58
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,730
Lu Wanwan.

59
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,780
I'll get water for you and you accompany me to do exercises.

60
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,140
I'll say it like this later.

61
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,660
Her boyfriend suddenly shows up

62
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,260
and gives her a surprise.

63
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,860
I'm doomed.

64
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,100
We're going to learn venipuncture.

65
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,380
It has always been inevitable.

66
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,500
We'll have to do it sooner or later.

67
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,980
This is not what I planned.

68
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,960
Looks like I just snatched the bottles from her.

69
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,540
Ren Chu.

70
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,420
What a coincidence.

71
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,020
That is my bottle.

72
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,460
Can I have it?

73
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,580
Lu Wanwan.

74
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,180
My bottle.

75
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,830
I'll buy you some water.

76
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,940
When you got hurt in the "chicken dinner" competition,

77
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,100
it was Ren Chu who sent you to the infirmary.

78
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,020
You seemed to get along well.

79
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,340
Why did you run away as soon as you saw him today?

80
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,820
Did he offend you?

81
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,340
Something is wrong.

82
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,420
Today when you mentioned him,

83
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,340
you didn't lose your temper or spit mean words about him.

84
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,200
The calmer the appearance looks,

85
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,740
the more billowy it might be deep inside.

86
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,290
I see!

87
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,770
Something must have happened in the infirmary that day.

88
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:53,220
No.

89
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,280
Nothing happened.

90
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,340
What do you know?

91
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,780
Don't talk nonsense.

92
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,820
You must have done something

93
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,020
that offended Ren Chu.

94
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:01,780
So he's here

95
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,040
to hold you to account.

96
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,100
That's why you didn't dare to face him

97
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,100
and ran away.

98
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,260
What?

99
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,140
Am I right?

100
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,980
I knew you were acting weird.

101
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,020
I don't know that person.

102
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,220
He's so vengeful.

103
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:21,010
I'm only her roommate, yet I'm implicated.

104
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,540
Most of you were operating it wrongly,

105
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,460
so the pain was distinct.

106
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,140
During the actual operations,

107
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,620
we adopt the venipuncture of

108
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,740
the needle bevel towards the left.

109
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,620
Here.

110
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,740
Look at me.

111
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,180
This is the needle bevel.

112
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,860
The angle between the needle and the surface of the arm

113
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,340
should be 30 to 45 degrees.

114
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:47,920
When you see the blood,

115
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,260
press down the needle immediately

116
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,140
and insert the needle into the vein a little.

117
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,540
After class, you can form groups of two

118
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,860
to practice more.

119
00:07:58,860 --> 00:07:59,900
This lesson should be learned

120
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,380
by practicing a lot.

121
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,380
Let's take a look at the slides.

122
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,840
Let's look at the structure of the endagium.

123
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,780
No way.

124
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,050
Are we going to perform venipuncture to each other?

125
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:16,510
How much of animosity must we have between us to do such a thing!

126
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,900
Please let me go.

127
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,100
It's okay.

128
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,060
I will work hard

129
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,590
and be responsible for you.

130
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,580
Excuse me.

131
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,980
Could you pass the bottles to Lu Wanwan?

132
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,820
Lu Wanwan?

133
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,620
Yes.

134
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,780
Thank you.

135
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,220
To Lu Wanwan.

136
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,900
Let's take a look at the structure of the endagium.

137
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,500
-Zhao Rui, give these to Lu Wanwan. -The endagium...

138
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,860
is the innermost part of the vascular wall.

139
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,660
It consists of endothelium and sub-endothelium.

140
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,980
Wanwan.

141
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,620
Ren Chu.

142
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,240
What a pleasant surprise.

143
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,660
Thank you.

144
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,250
Ren Chu,

145
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,700
do you know?

146
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,500
Last time I almost got a prize

147
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,500
in the Real-Life "Chicken Dinner" Competition.

148
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,380
If you didn't quit in the middle of the competition,

149
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,510
we would have been among the top three.

150
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,460
But

151
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,020
I'm happy enough

152
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,620
to be your teammate.

153
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,920
My bottle is finally back.

154
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,170
Ren Chu even filled water for me.

155
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,860
Look.

156
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,380
The campus queen and the campus king are standing together.

157
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,740
They are so well-matched.

158
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,300
A true sight for sore eyes.

159
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,020
It took such a short time

160
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,340
that the rumored girlfriend of the genius Ren Chu

161
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,580
has shifted from Wanwan to Guan Ai.

162
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,650
[A Little Bistro]

163
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,100
I heard from President Fan Yi that

164
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,060
you were sent to the infirmary by Ren Chu.

165
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,660
Did he take good care of you?

166
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,960
I don't want to talk about him.

167
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,340
What's wrong, Bro Wan?

168
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,140
Did he bully you?

169
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,820
Did he diss you?

170
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,380
He kissed me.

171
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:25,980
K-Kiss?

172
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,140
What?

173
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,670
Didn't you sprain your ankle?

174
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,860
Even an ankle sprain needs mouth-to-mouth resuscitation?

175
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,300
The Prince Charming saves people in a peculiar way...

176
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,180
No.

177
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,900
He took me to the infirmary that day.

178
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,340
Then,

179
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,380
when we got there,

180
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,910
he asked me to sit on the bed.

181
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,760
Then he started to bandage me.

182
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,420
Then...

183
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,700
Ren Chu must like you.

184
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,060
How could he like me?

185
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,540
I'm just an ordinary study slacker.

186
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,420
How could he like a study slacker?

187
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,260
Nonsense.

188
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,210
How are you ordinary?

189
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,900
Sis Yang.

190
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,340
Even if you fail every exam

191
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,360
and barely pass the make-up exams every time...

192
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,940
Even if he does like someone,

193
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,060
he should like girls such as Guan Ai.

194
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,060
What could he like about me?

195
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,140
My bad grades or

196
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,740
the fact that I don't wash my hair before meeting him?

197
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,620
Fine. Let's say he likes me.

198
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,220
He has never said anything.

199
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,040
Without a formal profession of love,

200
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,780
how can he abruptly kiss me like that?

201
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,140
That was my first kiss.

202
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,720
Is it appropriate?

203
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,380
Listen,

204
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,460
the campus king doesn't have to be with the campus queen.

205
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,520
It doesn't matter what others think.

206
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,410
You won't understand

207
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,890
what a rough love life I've had.

208
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,980
Before, I'd had a crush on An Jiaxian for years,

209
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,540
but it ended in failure.

210
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,180
Then I wanted to pursue you,

211
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,340
but failed again.

212
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,130
Now I hope that the straight-A student likes me?

213
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,790
I'd better not dream too much.

214
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,290
I'll get hysteria.

215
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,580
What did you say?

216
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,620
Nothing. Let's go back.

217
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,340
Wait!

218
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,180
What was all that?

219
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,270
When did you ever pursue me?

220
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:28,780
And... why?

221
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,140
What else can it be?

222
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,050
Are you stupid?

223
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,300
I wanted to date you.

224
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,460
Are you crazy?

225
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,620
Date me?

226
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,750
You ever courted me?

227
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,660
Why did I have no clue at all?

228
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,210
That's why my love life is rough.

229
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,180
But

230
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,540
I've realized my errors and mended my ways now.

231
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,300
I'm indeed suitable to stay in the friend zone of boys.

232
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,380
Now that I think about it,

233
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,660
it's good to be your bro.

234
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,540
Of course.

235
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,740
Is there a friendship firmer than ours?

236
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,440
It's not like no one is chasing me.

237
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,840
You mean when you're scrambling for the blue in the jungle of the game?

238
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,940
Stop right there!

239
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:11,580
How's your postgraduate recommendation going?

240
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,820
A senior student in Pingzhou University has invited me to their lab next week.

241
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,180
I want to think more about it.

242
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,260
Pingzhou is a good university.

243
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,180
But

244
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,510
do you want to check our school's lab, too?

245
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,580
The teacher of the Department of Computer Science and Technology has contacted me.

246
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,580
You should really think it through.

247
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,540
Choosing a school is not only about professors,

248
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,940
but also about its academic atmosphere and research topics.

249
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,100
Is that Wang Xinyu's gift to you?

250
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,220
Yeah, she's afraid she can't find me.

251
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,020
Can you really accept

252
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,020
such a lame idea?

253
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,980
I don't want to use a phone,

254
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,460
but I don't want her to worry, either.

255
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,700
So that's the only way.

256
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,230
Your cousin is very clingy.

257
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,100
I wish my girlfriend

258
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,700
was that clingy.

259
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,740
You have a girlfriend?

260
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,740
Lu Wanwan.

261
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,660
Does she have a cold temperament?

262
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,860
I must congratulate you first.

263
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,920
You lovebirds are finally together.

264
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,980
It seems that

265
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,750
she's deliberately avoiding me.

266
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:08,940
Isn't it great?

267
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,080
This way you can focus on your scientific research.

268
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:15,340
It would be great if

269
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,570
Wang Xinyu was half as phlegmatic as Lu Wanwan.

270
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,100
It would be great if

271
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,430
Lu Wanwan was half as clingy as Wang Xinyu.

272
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,420
Here, a toast.

273
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,420
By the way,

274
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,020
don't tell your cousin

275
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,460
I came out for dinner with you today.

276
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,340
When you see Lu Wanwan,

277
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,870
mention our meeting to her.

278
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:35,550
[Baking Room, Qingyao University]

279
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,060
Come on, Lu Wanwan.

280
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:42,900
It'll be fine.

281
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,220
Don't panic.

282
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,100
I'm telling you, our teacher will definitely test us this.

283
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,540
-It hurts! -What's wrong? Don't know.

284
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,900
-Let's go. -Yeah.

285
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,660
That's impossible.

286
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,380
It went okay when I pricked the tangerine peel.

287
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,180
I've done it twice. Why isn't it still not working?

288
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,700
I don't believe this!

289
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,740
Five, six, seven, eight.

290
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:14,780
Two, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

291
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,900
Three, two, three, four...

292
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,740
Ren Chu,

293
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,420
are you going to Pingzhou University to do your postgraduate study?

294
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,460
If you leave,

295
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,340
the president will have to be someone else.

296
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,220
No, Ren Chu.

297
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,330
Can you not go?

298
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,100
Without you scolding us,

299
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,560
we won't get any progress.

300
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,940
Okay, let's exercise.

301
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,070
Get ready for the training.

302
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,670
You even bring your phone to the training.

303
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,660
You're smiling so happily.

304
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,020
A new girlfriend?

305
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,130
A girl in the senior year.

306
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,860
What's your trick?

307
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,660
You can always get a girlfriend.

308
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,579
What's so hard about that?

309
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:11,310
Chasing girls basically takes only three moves.

310
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,660
Stop!

311
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,640
Finish your sentence.

312
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:17,740
Ren Chu, my training really isn't impacted by

313
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,940
my being in a relationship.

314
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,690
Make it clear how you get the girl.

315
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:21,819
I'll decide

316
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:24,150
whether your training is impacted or not.

317
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,530
It's nothing really.

318
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,020
The girl didn't agree to date me at first.

319
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,460
Then I suddenly appeared

320
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,620
and found a chance to wall bam her.

321
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,180
I also send her gifts and flowers,

322
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,740
and say some cheesy chat-up lines.

323
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,870
Girls all like those things nowadays.

324
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,930
It really didn't impact my training.

325
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,780
I've only met her five times.

326
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,340
Go back to school.

327
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,400
I'll go see you after the experiment.

328
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,540
I'll definitely go to you.

329
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,780
Besides,

330
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,380
you can see my location.

331
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,180
Xibai,

332
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,700
do your experiment.

333
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,440
I'm staying here with you.

334
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,100
I won't disturb you.

335
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,790
Cousin-in-law, are you cultivating?

336
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,860
I'm accompanying Xibai for his experiment.

337
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,720
That's what a lady should be like.

338
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,930
You look a bit different.

339
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,220
How could it be?

340
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,940
I'm always like this.

341
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,400
What happened to your arm?

342
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:47,620
What happened?

343
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,170
Is it domestic violence?

344
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:49,900
No.

345
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,860
I practiced the venipuncture.

346
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,660
Venipuncture?

347
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,700
So you pricked yourself?

348
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,740
I have no choice.

349
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,420
I'm not skilled,

350
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,660
and I don't dare to prick my classmates straightaway, either.

351
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,090
So I came to ask Xibai.

352
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,620
Do you have any advice?

353
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,140
You can recruit volunteers.

354
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,020
You'll be nervous if you prick someone you know.

355
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,380
But a stranger

356
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,700
will make you feel responsible.

357
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,140
Maybe you can do better.

358
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,540
You...

359
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,100
are capable enough.

360
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,340
You are just too weak in terms of psychological quality.

361
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,620
Thank you for your advice.

362
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,660
I'll leave you two alone then.

363
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,870
Lu Wanwan.

364
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,860
Mind you: don't practice it on your boyfriend.

365
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,580
You won't be able to do it because you love him too dearly.

366
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,540
If you do it hesitantly,

367
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,180
it would end up even harder to master it.

368
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,580
I don't have a boyfriend.

369
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,620
Ren Chu said you two are in a relationship.

370
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,860
What? He...

371
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,740
Congratulations, cousin-in-law.

372
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,470
You're officially my cousin-in-law from now on.

373
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,080
Ren Chu, I won't let you off!

374
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,780
She's pretty and has a nice figure.

375
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,860
And she looks so gentle when she smiles.

376
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,380
How did you get her?

377
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,980
-Yeah, how? -Yeah.

378
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,540
Now you don't understand.

379
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,940
You have to make the girl feel

380
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,900
you care about her at every moment.

381
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,340
Otherwise, how can you make your presence felt by her?

382
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,140
If your presence is so weak,

383
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,470
how can the girl know you're pursuing her?

384
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,300
Is it that complicated?

385
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,620
As long as a boy is not ugly,

386
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,860
and he can chit-chat,

387
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,460
I think girls won't object to him approaching.

388
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,260
That's right.

389
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,020
That makes sense.

390
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:25,980
Ren Chu.

391
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,010
Come and talk.

392
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:36,540
"Ren Chu, come and talk."

393
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,300
Go and talk.

394
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,740
Go to practice.

395
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:43,050
If your swimming performance time didn't improve by 0.3 seconds today,

396
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,050
the swimming pool is yours to clean.

397
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,300
-Boring! -Let's go.

398
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,940
Which arm should I use

399
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,580
to wall bam Lu Wanwan in a second,

400
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,100
left arm or right?

401
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,960
[Qingyao University Swimming Club]

402
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,610
You look

403
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,590
pretty today.

404
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,060
He Yifeng just said that.

405
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,850
Did I say it in a wrong tone?

406
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:32,970
You...

407
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:34,700
I've finally seen it all today.

408
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,580
Do you guys always talk about girls

409
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,970
like that?

410
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,230
How does she look?

411
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:39,900
What's her figure like?

412
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,240
Who is better at flirting?

413
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:41,700
No.

414
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,460
No?

415
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,490
Getting a girl means you are capable.

416
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,870
If you can have many girlfriends,

417
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,800
you will be praised and envied.

418
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,360
What do you take girls for?

419
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,460
A trophy that you all compete for

420
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,930
and you can tease at will?

421
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:56,780
Who teased you?

422
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,670
How dare you ask me?

423
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,350
I want to ask you

424
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,570
why you told Xibai that

425
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,870
we are in a relationship?

426
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,010
Aren't we dating?

427
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,270
Of course not!

428
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,270
You didn't profess your love to me.

429
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,530
Nor did I accept any profession.

430
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:09,420
What kind of relationship is that?

431
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,520
As for that time you kissed me,

432
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,690
you were totally playing with me.

433
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:12,410
You misunderstood me.

434
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,170
Are you going to say you like me?

435
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,090
My grades are bad,

436
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:16,350
but I'm not stupid.

437
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,370
We are from two different worlds.

438
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,590
Calm down.

439
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:22,850
I don't want to get involved in another love entanglement.

440
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,360
And I don't want to be gossipped about by the whole school, either.

441
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,240
See you!

442
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,300
No, never see you!

443
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:31,980
Lu Wanwan.

444
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,660
What's wrong with your arm?

445
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:51,170
Hello, cousin. Come and help me.

446
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,030
Meng Xibai wants to drive me away.

447
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,990
I just want to stay with you.

448
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,380
I'm not leaving.

449
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,100
Xinyu, go back now.

450
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:58,440
Xinyu.

451
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,490
Wang Xinyu.

452
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:00,700
Cousin,

453
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,050
he's kicking me out.

454
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,090
I don't need you to do experiments with me.

455
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,740
My cousin and his girlfriend are so sweet.

456
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,450
I want kisses, hugs, and to be lifted up like them.

457
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:11,500
I can't lift you up.

458
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,160
How could my cousin lift his girlfriend up then?

459
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,370
Then let him lift you.

460
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:17,340
I refuse.

461
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,160
What did she do this time?

462
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:19,900
Good you're here.

463
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,030
Come and judge this.

464
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,170
Your cousin has been sitting at the door of the lab for a whole day.

465
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,970
I can't focus on the experiment.

466
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,660
She's wasting our time.

467
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,170
Sorry.

468
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:28,930
I'll take her away with me.

469
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:30,660
Just focus on your experiment.

470
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,500
I'm not leaving.

471
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,800
I won't leave.

472
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:35,730
Xibai.

473
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,380
I knew you'd be on my side, cousin.

474
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,140
Let me clarify it.

475
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,060
I was wrong last time.

476
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,520
I don’t have a girlfriend.

477
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,100
Xibai.

478
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:55,110
Didn't you say you were going to be demure?

479
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:09,670
I don't like iced water.

480
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:11,470
Can't you buy me a glass of juice?

481
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,520
Cousin,

482
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:14,870
didn't you earn a lot of money from your scholarship?

483
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,340
It's not for you to drink.

484
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,340
Then what is it for?

485
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:22,700
It's for pouring on your head to calm you down.

486
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:27,050
I just want to spend more time with Xibai.

487
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,730
He doesn’t use a phone,

488
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,950
so we can't bond through the Internet.

489
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,610
All I can do is to go to school to accompany him.

490
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:35,120
If a couple doesn't see each other for a long time,

491
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,120
it'd be easy for them to drift apart.

492
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,100
Can you think about it

493
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,900
in Meng Xibai's shoes?

494
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,530
Think what he really wants.

495
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,420
Do you know why he kicked you out?

496
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:49,100
He must think I'm annoying.

497
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,120
He just doesn't love me as much as I do him.

498
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,250
Scientific research is hard work,

499
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,180
especially medicine.

500
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,690
This is not an easy path.

501
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:56,660
Meng Xibai often stayed in the lab

502
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,550
for half a month just waiting for an experiment result.

503
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,310
Every conclusion

504
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:01,240
is crucial to a researcher.

505
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,460
Any pathological factor

506
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,840
could happen in flash,

507
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,240
which is unpredictable.

508
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,620
If you stay at the door,

509
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,710
he can't focus.

510
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,570
You're wasting everyone's time.

511
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:11,150
When he finishes his work,

512
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,450
he will surely come to meet you

513
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:13,920
and arrange a date.

514
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:17,770
When I was at the door,

515
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,380
he couldn't focus.

516
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,420
Did he keep thinking about me?

517
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,890
I didn't know I was so charming!

518
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,350
Gosh.

519
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:33,540
Did I seriously disturb him?

520
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,130
No!

521
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:36,720
I have to apologize.

522
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,900
Otherwise what can I do

523
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,100
if he refuses to date me again in future?

524
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:46,470
Lu Wanwan.

525
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,780
What do you want?

526
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,180
[Recruit: Venipuncture volunteers]

527
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:14,700
Please leave.

528
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,430
We agreed not to see each other.

529
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,820
"We're recruiting for venipuncture volunteers."

530
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,910
Is this the place?

531
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,460
What?

532
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,470
Are you coming to mock me?

533
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,560
I'm a volunteer.

534
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:26,830
I don't need your help.

535
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,340
You're mistaken.

536
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,530
I just want to learn about the venipuncture.

537
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:31,910
My research topic of my postgraduate program

538
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:34,440
is the combination of human structure and AI.

539
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:37,750
Really?

540
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,690
Didn't you say you want to improve your specialized course?

541
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:41,950
I'm the only volunteer.

542
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,130
Why did you refuse?

543
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,370
Don't you want to practice?

544
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:00,680
Okay then.

545
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,300
Nervous?

546
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:40,580
No.

547
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,890
I'm professional.

548
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,570
I'm an athlete,

549
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:46,290
and I have a high pain threshold.

550
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,620
Otherwise, I wouldn't come to volunteer.

551
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:49,820
You can be bolder.

552
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,270
Sorry.

553
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,240
It's okay.

554
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,590
It doesn't hurt.

555
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:41,980
The bright red blood means I've pricked...

556
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:42,990
The artery.

557
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,280
Don't panic.

558
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,580
I'll deal with it right away.

559
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,640
I'm not panicking.

560
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:57,690
I'm sorry.

561
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:58,200
I...

562
00:28:58,530 --> 00:28:59,460
It doesn't hurt.

563
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,650
You don't feel pain even like this?

564
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,370
You're truly gifted

565
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,880
and peculiar.

566
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:09,790
Lu Wanwan,

567
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,600
don't think of anything.

568
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,930
Be bold and meticulous.

569
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:15,920
Take this as a math exam.

570
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,520
You already know the formula.

571
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,850
Just put the numbers in.

572
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,910
One more time.

573
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:37,420
You can do this.

574
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,180
Are you sure?

575
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,510
It's pretty good this time.

576
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:18,970
You'll make it next time.

577
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,630
Does it hurt?

578
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,480
It's nothing.

579
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:32,200
I just want the data.

580
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:34,300
Besides,

581
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,290
It doesn't hurt at all.

582
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,830
As promised,

583
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:44,590
I'll make you a dessert.

584
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,850
What do you want to eat?

585
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,310
Chocolate lava cake.

586
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,140
Make it sweet.

587
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,110
No problem.

588
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:54,550
I'll get going then.

589
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:09,790
I finally did it.

590
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,910
I'm an athlete,

591
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:21,170
and I have a high pain threshold.

592
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:22,350
You can be bolder.

593
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,630
You'll make it next time.

594
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,290
He said it didn't hurt.

595
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,230
He indeed is a liar.

596
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,170
Pair up.

597
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:54,140
The result

598
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,030
will be included into your final performance.

599
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,030
You can start now.

600
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:03,590
Even if you don't care about your grades,

601
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,310
do be responsible for my arm.

602
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,260
Be careful, please.

603
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:12,790
Don't worry.

604
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:14,340
The one with the lower grade

605
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,940
will buy lunch for the other.

606
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,430
[Balance]

607
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:31,270
Beware of protein toxicity.

608
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:33,620
I'm still growing. I'm not afraid.

609
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,650
How did you suddenly become so formidable?

610
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:39,980
I was ready for getting the varicose vein.

611
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:42,990
I didn't expect you to pass with only one go.

612
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,310
I told you I'm not a study slacker.

613
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:49,850
You must have practiced a lot.

614
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,070
I did well in the test.

615
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,210
How shall I give you the cake?

616
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:02,210
Shall I send it to the Swimming Club?

617
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:04,070
No need for us to meet each other.

618
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,410
Put the cake in No. 79 locker

619
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,340
on the west side of the playground.

620
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:11,260
Why is he suddenly sensible?

621
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:13,940
Who?

622
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,489
The drumsticks are so delicious.

623
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,750
Beware of dying from eating too much.

624
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:39,139
Xibai,

625
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:40,570
this is our first date.

626
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:41,830
What are we going to do?

627
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,300
Shall we go boating in the lake,

628
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,510
have a picnic by the lake,

629
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,400
or...

630
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,199
Fishing.

631
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,980
How could he be so patient?

632
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,620
He really likes demure girls.

633
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,640
No matter how cold he is,

634
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,910
he can't resist my temptation all the same.

635
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:58,310
Can't he hold it anymore?

636
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:05,820
Cold, cold!

637
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,760
Are you awake?

638
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,190
You got bitten by a mosquito.

639
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,280
Let me apply some Essential Balm for you.

640
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,210
Don’t move.

641
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,200
Xibai,

642
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,760
you are so warm and considerate.

643
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,530
I like you so much!

644
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,930
I mean,

645
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:31,740
thank you.

646
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:33,840
Xinyu.

647
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,850
You are good enough just the way you are.

648
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:37,980
You don't have to pretend to be demure.

649
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,880
Do you mean

650
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,190
you like the way I am?

651
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:48,910
I told you

652
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,640
we fell in love at first sight.

653

655
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:54,750
Let go.

656
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,970
-I've got the Essential Balm in my eye! -No, I won't.

657
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:56,940
I won't let go.

658
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:57,900
Xinyu, stop it.

659
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,040
No.

660
00:36:59,040 --> 00:36:59,830
It's the Essential Balm.

661
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:01,470
I like you, Xibai.

662
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:02,940
It stings!

667
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:32,130
This is a forced trade.

668
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:43,760
Yummy.

669
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:46,710
Which brand of soy milk is it?

670
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:50,030
Why haven't I ever bought such delicious soy milk before?

671
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,850
[I've bought too much, so this bottle is for you. 4.5 Yuan. Transfer the money via WeChat.]

672
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:15,520
Do you guys always talk about girls

673
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,860
like that?

674
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,570
What do you take girls for?

675
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,720
A trophy that you all compete for

676
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,120
and you can tease at will?

677
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,910
Have I gone too far?

678
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,630
Who am I to yell at him like that?

679
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,280
He's quite cultured

680
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:35,870
that he didn't hit me back.

681
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,520
Doesn't that mean I'm very rude?

682
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:45,420
How about

683
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:47,110
I apologize to him?

684
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,260
A great man knows when to yield and when not.

685
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,820
I just said harsh words.

686
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:01,500
If I apologize to him

687
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,810
and thank him now,

688
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,400
it'll look so weird.

Shall I write a Post-it note, too?

691
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:14,630
That way I can avoid the awkwardness.

692
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,800
Fan Yi,

693
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:49,260
you're sure Ren Chu has finished his training,

694

aren't you?

695
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,940
I just contacted him.

696
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,200

What kind of stupid password is this?

702
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,810
They are the digits from 23 to 30 to decimal places of Pi.

703
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,190
You even learned to steal, didn't you?

I got disconnected just now.

00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:26,940
Ren Chu's training is over.

00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,670
Maybe he's taking a shower now.

707
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,430
Why did you install a lock

708
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,280
for the locker?

709
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:38,120
I don't want to

receive weird things all the time,

711

[Ren Chu, I'm sorry! I shouldn't have yelled at you that day.]

00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,060
Since we're just classmates,

you can just forget that kiss.

725

At that moment,

726
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,650
it was all because of something similar to dopamine,

727
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:37,110
instead of real feelings.

728
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,140
It was not love

729
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:41,070
or teasing.

730
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:44,100
