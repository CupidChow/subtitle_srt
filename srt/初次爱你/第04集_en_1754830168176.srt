Do you think my dance is beautiful?

161
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,020
That's because I've been learning dancing since I was five.

162
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:10,900
What else do you want to know about me?

170

she's totally different

172
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,220
from the type I like.

173
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,940
So falling in love at first sight

174
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,980
is a false statement.

175
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,300
Judging from this case,

176
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,080

After that, I just be myself

377
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,540
and played a game with him seriously.

378
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,060
He smiled at me!

379
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,630
It was just different from what we thought at the beginning.

380
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:15,750
How could this happen?

381
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,380
I did confuse the data.

382
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,180
What happened?

383
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,020
Forget it. Love is too hard.

384
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,140
I'll leave after this round.

385
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,260
You look like a normal person

386
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,020
when playing games.

387
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,500
I am a normal person.

388
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:06,460
You didn't see yourself frowning.

389
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,980
I was winking.

390
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,620
By the way, my name is Wang Yuyang.

391
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,900
This "Yu" is a rare character.

392
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,480
I have checked.

393
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,280
It's the same as Xun Yu, right?

394
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,860
Yes, you know it!

395
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,620
Few people know that.

396
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,060
My name is Lu Wanwan.

397
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,620
Good job, bro.

398
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,460
Not only can you play games,

399
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,220
you also know that rare character of my name.

400
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,420
Come on, let's add friends on WeChat.

401
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,580
Let's play together later.

402
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,700
I only add people who are awesome.

403
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,260
Bro...

404
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,180
You don't like to call me bro?

405
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,610
Can we call each other more closely?

406
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,620
How about we call each other sis?

407
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:58,940
Forget it.

408
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,020
I mean,

409
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,180
more special

410
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,220
and closer.

411
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,300
Girls are troublesome.

412
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:15,650
I'll call you Bro Wan.

413
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:19,020
You call me Sis Yang. Special enough, huh?

414
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,220
What a strange guy...

415
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,300
He asked to add you first?

416
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,500
I was surprised too.

417
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,060
I thought I screwed it up.

418
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:29,940
I screwed it up.

419
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,420
I knew you wouldn't like it.

420
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,020
I should have taken him down once and for all.

421
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:35,780
But it's okay.

422
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,260
I'm going to send him desserts.

423
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,780
I'll make desserts for him every day and visit him often.

424
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,580
No.

425
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,940
It will affect your study.

426
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:45,860
It's okay.

427
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,860
I'll make desserts in my spare time.

428
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:51,260
It's a waste of time to deliver desserts. Let me help you.

429
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,320
Then I won't have a chance to meet him.

430
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,380
Haven't you heard the theory of

431
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,580
"Play Cat and Mouse"?

432
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,900
Look at Wang Xinyu,

433
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,460
she is tangling with Meng Xibai all day.

434
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,060
Have they made any progress?

435
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,700
Sounds reasonable.

436
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,100
Tell me when you're done.

437
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,420
I'll go to the library to study first

438
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,020
and make them in the evening.

439
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,340
What happened?

440
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:38,620
I was fine just now.

441
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,460
Why does it hurt when I read?

442
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,900
Am I not fit to study?

443
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,190
I'll send you back to your dorm.

444
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,020
Why are you here?

445
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,020
Studying in the library, of course.

446
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,380
Let's go.

447
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:55,930
♫Unconsciously I stop with your wandering sight♫

448
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:03,640
♫Unconsciously we collect each other's understanding smile♫

449
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:11,470
♫Unconsciously holding our fingertips that touch each other♫

450
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:19,210
♫Unconsciously close to you our hearts can't be far apart♫

451
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:27,950
♫Love makes the heartbeat resonate strongly in this moment♫

452
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:35,190
♫Fancies and attachments overlap and fade♫

453
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,050
What is the stomach medicine that you often take?

454
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:31,340
I'll buy it for you now.

455
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,300
I don't usually take medicine.

456
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,570
The doctor told me it's shallow gastritis.

457
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,780
♫I found the truth finally♫

458
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:37,540
I don't need to take medicine.

459
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,140
I just need something to nourish my stomach.

460
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:45,920
♫You came into my world and stealed all the joy♫

461
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,940
For example, soy milk.

462
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,340
There was a moment when I felt

463
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:53,410
♫It's like a May lightning bolt, too special to describe♫

464
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,600
Wang Yuyang was just like An Jiaxian.

465
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,300
Now I don’t think so.

466
00:28:53,410 --> 00:29:01,500
♫You came into my world and left all about you♫

467
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,660
Why am I telling you this?

468
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:10,370
♫From when I suddenly miss you so accurate♫

469
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,670
The canteen is right ahead.

470
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,080
There are many people.

471
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:10,700
It's not safe.

472
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,580
You go first. I'll take a rest.

473
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,430
Are you still going to pursue Wang Yuyang?

474
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:38,020
I'll carry your bag to the girls' dorm.

475
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,180
Don't make desserts tonight.

476
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,380
No hurry.

477
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:56,660
Wanwan.

478
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,290
Wanwan.

479
00:29:58,290 --> 00:29:58,980
The RA

480
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,510
just brought your bag here.

481
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,780
Ren Chu told her that

482
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,940
you had a stomachache and asked her to bring it to you.

483
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,060
Are you okay?

484
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,900
Did you have a stomachache because of Ren Chu?

485
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,380
No, he helped me.

486
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,620
He's a nice guy.

487
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,780
Qiao,

488
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:20,710
do you think I should continue to pursue Wang Yuyang?

489
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,940
I don't think I like him that much.

490
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,180
Don't think too much.

491
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,820
Have you forgotten what happened when you held back your feelings?

492
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,060
Take the initiative this time

493
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,140
and get him as soon as possible.

494
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,020
Love can be developed gradually.

495
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,140
Love can be developed?

496
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,220
Of course.

497
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,940
You just don't know him well.

498
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,580
He meets your standards for a boyfriend.

499
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,020
Both of you are single.

500
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,570
Why can't you have a try?

501
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,500
Mango cake.

502
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:50,220
Please give this to Wang Yuyang for me.

503
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,900
What's wrong?

504
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:09,980
Nothing.

505
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:12,300
I thought it was the interview notice from Ping University.

506
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,980
Aren't you going to apply for our university?

507
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,640
I want to try Ping university.

508
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:19,100
It's far from Qingyao.

509
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,660
Good luck.

510
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,740
I'm capable. I don't need good luck.

511
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,020
Then...

512
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,900
Can I

513
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,300
have a look of your

514
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,730
Rumor Elimination Plan?

515
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:35,980
Both of us have a copy.

516
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,980
Where is yours?

517
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,720
Love can be developed gradually.

518
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,640
Love can be developed?

519
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,580
Of course.

520
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,220
From tomorrow onwards,

521
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,700
I will make desserts for him.

522
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,100
I always felt sorry before.

523
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,360
Now I can make desserts as compensation.

524
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,020
Just do it.

525
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,900
-Excuse me. -My milk tea.

526
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,780
My plan!

527
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:09,810
[Rumor Elimination Plan]

528
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,660
Wanwan,

529
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:15,060
my milk tea is guilty but I'm innocent.

530
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,980
How about you ask Ren Chu for another copy?

531
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,330
I'll make it up to you.

532
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:22,130
I'll buy you milk tea for a month.

533
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:28,380
Forget it. It was my fault.

534
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,700
Did you lose it?

535
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,740
Lose... What if I lost it?

536
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,980
According to the contract law, it is invalid if it's lost.

537
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,020
No!

538
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,170
How could I lose it?

539
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:46,980
I just want to see

540
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,820
if there are any typos in yours.

541
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,300
I have something to do. I have to go.

542
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,210
Lu Wanwan.

543
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,940
I didn't lose it!

544
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:12,980
Soy...milk?

545
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,740
I ordered soy milk for the swimming club members.

546
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,580
There is one more cup left,

547
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,060
so I brought it to you passingly.

548
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,210
Try it. If you think it tastes good,

549
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:22,670
I'll order from this restaurant from now on.

550
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,060
Senior, when it comes to eating,

551
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,590
you don't seem to be very good at it.

552
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,460
It's like the water used to wash pots.

553
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,320
They didn't add enough soy beans.

554
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,300
It doesn't taste like soy milk at all.

555
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,430
Listen to my advice.

556
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,630
It's better to change your choice.

557
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,100
I'm leaving.

558
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,060
Sorry, I got into the wrong room.

559
