[-They are born to be together. -I have no chance anymore. -My Guan Ai.]

5
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,660
Yes.

6
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,530
Yes, I do like someone.

7
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,140
[I've even figured out what their baby's name should be.]

8
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:49,530
And she is right here.

00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,660
[-My muse. -Profess in front of the whole school.]

10
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,020
I'm sure. I know.

11
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,820
It is really outrageous!

12
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,060
What is over-interpretation?

13
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,190
This is called over-interpretation.

14
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,260
It is obvious that he was expressing his point of view

15
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,460
in the debate.

16
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,500
How did it turn out to be Ren Chu's confession to Guan Ai?

17
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,100
You're right!

18
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,860
He talks about alpha and beta everyday

19
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,460
and says it is about the research topics.

20
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,720
In fact, he is already in a relationship.

21
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,860
He still thinks our ideas are bad

22
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,420
and also increased our training volume because of that.

23
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,460
You're right.

24
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,140
Well, I think he was looking at me

25
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,460
when he was saying it.

26
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,220
How come no one interprets it?

27
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,100
Where are those who spread rumours about us

28
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,660
and the fans of us being together?

29
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,020
Follow up! Stand up!

30
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:35,260
It was my lack of candour that

31
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,190
led to many missed opportunities.

32
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,620
Now it's the time

33
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,740
to take the plunge.

34
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:45,410
I need you all

35
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,220
to do me a vital favour.

36
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,820
What's that?

37
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,650
No. I can't leave it like that!

38
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,100
Murder and arson are not acceptable. Calm down.

39
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,060
I've decided that I want to

40
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:00,580
-profess my love. -Profess my love.

41
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,540
What reaction is this?

42
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,220
Profess your love for Ren Chu?

43
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,860
What? Shouldn't I?

44
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,340
Give it a further thought.

45
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,180
How about studying the steps of murdering and committing arson?

46
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,740
I have decided.

47
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,980
Please think carefully.

48
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,300
Think about your previous experiences.

49
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,540
You haven't succeeded even once

50
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,180
on the road of professing your love.

51
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,300
You've caused a lot of trouble because of that.

52
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,420
Now I'm different from who I was before.

53
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,100
Sink or swim.

54
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,300
Please think carefully, Wanwan.

55
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,010
Don't ruin it.

56
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,020
Qiao,

57
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,060
I know you're worried that I would screw up again.

58
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,860
But I'm really not impulsive this time.

59
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,860
I really like Ren Chu.

60
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,140
I don't want to hide it like I did before.

61
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,860
It ended up me being slower than others.

62
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,740
Even if Ren Chu likes Guan Ai,

63
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,770
I still want him to know my heart.

64
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:58,020
Let me give it a plunge.

65
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,180
Alright. I understand.

66
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,620
I support you unconditionally.

67
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,820
So, have you thought about how to profess your love?

68
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,980
No.

69
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,100
I have to think carefully about this.

70
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,300
Professing love is what I had done before.

71
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,500
I have learned something.

72
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,930
What is it?

73
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,220
Exclusion.

74
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,660
By excluding the suggestions of Meng Xibai and Wang Xinyu,

75
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,820
the chance of success is more than 80%.

76
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:26,820
Then I suggest that you just go over

77
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,650
and give her a hug. It's better than anything else.

78
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,140
That might be suspected of being a hooligan.

79
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,470
I suggest to use the method of exclusion to calculate first.

80
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,890
If the mathematician's algorithm goes wrong,

81
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,409
let's try the physicist's theory.

82
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:44,700
How about using the theory of relativity to solve the problem?

83
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,250
I think mechanics can do it.

84
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,340
You keep putting pressure on until the other side can't take it anymore.

85
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,220
What are these?

86
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,420
What is the most important thing of professing your love?

87
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,540
Ritual. Girls are emotional.

88
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,180
It needs to be touching. Keep in mind 3W.

89
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,780
Three W?

90
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,050
You all don't even know this?

91
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,450
How to profess your love?

92
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,340
Keep in mind these 3W.

93

Where, When, and What.

94
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,900

Tell the most romantic sweet nothings.

97
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,580
Then it will work.

98
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,380
Sounds reasonable.

99
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,830
My girlfriend always says that I'm not romantic,

100
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,280
or that I don't pay attention to details.

101
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:35,340
Agreed.

102
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,300

103
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,780
with data analysis.

104
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,550
Use the school as the center

105
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,020

106
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,950

114
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,980
I'll come to you.

115
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:26,490
What're you doing?

116
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,550
That is the dessert I made for the theatrical festival.

117
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,860
Don't eat anymore.

118
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,100
I feel so wrong.

119
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,740
Why can't I eat the dessert?

120
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,580
I've never seen such a thick-skinned person before.

121
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,060
Don't eat anymore!

122
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,820
Bro Wan, you've changed.

123
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,940
Am I the one you adore the most?

124
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,780
No.

125
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,610
Just say it.

126

The quota of the exchange student is gone.

127
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,510
Weren't you pretty confident?

128
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,900
Not when it comes to the advantages of postgraduate entrance examination.

129
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,400
Then Liang Xia got the quota?

130
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:04,660
That's right.

131
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,500
Hasn't she got a boyfriend

132
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,250
who loves her a lot?

133
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,400
Why doing a postgraduate program?

134
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,980
Liang Xia said before that

135
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,680
she would only go for a one-year exchange program abroad.

136
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,810
Why's she going for postgraduate now?

137
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,620
So, An Jiaxian,

138
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,210
have you bought Liang Xia home to meet your parents during Chinese New Year this year?

139
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,020
Not yet.

140
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,230
But I have this plan in mind.

141
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,700
Liang Xia is going to study abroad for a year.

142
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,140
She's sensitive and insecure.

143
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,830
So, I think it's better for them to meet

144
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,800
so that she can study well abroad.

145
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,460
An Jiaxian doesn't know yet.

146
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,980
Don't worry about them.

147
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,780
But think about your own profession.

150
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,830
Don't get involved.

151

Bro Wan, you are going to profess your love again?

152
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,220
To whom this time?

153
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,530
Not to you anyway.

154
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,580
Don't let me meet An Jiaxian.

00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,620
Do you have indigestion?

188
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,480
Do you have upper abdominal pain?

189
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:04,940
No.

190
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,980
Let go first.

191
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,660
Don't be scared. I am a doctor.

192
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,860
I'm really okay.

193
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,170
Don't lie to yourself.

194
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,260
Please believe in medicine.

195
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,710
I accompany my classmate here.

196
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,180
You... you don't have cancer?

197
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,660
I'm well and free of cancer.

198
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,340
But this...

199
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,820
This was what I read just now

200
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,380
because of boredom.

201
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,540
You still care about me.

202
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,260
Xibai. I knew it.

203
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,390
You still care about me and like me.

204
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,660
Xibai.

205
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,460
Jump up. And I'll hug you.

206
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,840
If there's nothing else,

207
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,640
I'll go back first. My classmate is waiting for me.

208
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,760
More words lead to more mistakes.

209
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,190
I can't talk too much that leads to trouble.

210
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,390
[Are you going to the swimming pool tomorrow? I'll come to you.]

211
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,950
Fan Yi. He can't buy me that much

212
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,500
even though I love to eat it.

213
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,480
Wanwan.

214
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,680
Can I borrow the refrigerator from your Baking Club?

215
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,730
[Are you going to the swimming pool tomorrow? I'll come to you.]

216
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:15,230
[There's an activity in the swimming pool at noon. I'll be there at 3:00 p.m.]

217
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,520
Qiao, he replies to me.

218
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm going to have a boyfriend.

219
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,320
You just go directly to the swimming pool to profess

220
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,790
without even picking a romantic place.

221
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,710
Will it work?

222
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,580
I've consulted a love guru.

223
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,350
A love guru? For real?

224
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,870
If you want to cry,

225
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,140
please call me earlier. I have a date tonight.

226
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,910
I won't cry.

227
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,100
The love guru I consulted

228
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,840
is very reliable.

229
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,450
I want to profess my love for Ren Chu.

230
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,600
You want to express your feelings to him?

231
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,450
Cousin-in-law, you're so amazing!

232
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,920
How are you planning to profess your love?

233
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,510
Please teach me.

234
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,770
You're asking the right person on this regard.

235
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,350
The taboo of professing your love is thinking too much.

236
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:15,080
Tricks like choosing gifts and venues

237
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,840
are all nothing.

238
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,240
All you need is be quick and direct.

239
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,200
Just go to him directly

240
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,250
and surprisingly.

241
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,180
Then speak out your heart in one go.

242
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,320
If it can't work out this time, try again next time.

243
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,360
What else?

244
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,510
You have to be bold, yet cautious

245
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,270
when you profess your love.

246
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,780
There is no retreat.

247
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:39,020
You'll only get what you want when you go all out.

248
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,530
What else?

249
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,540
Cousin-in-law, look how sincere you are.

250
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,130
Let me teach you another strategy.

251
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,990
This strategy is very important.

252
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,490
You must do it.

253
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,080
Please slightly move your head here.

254
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,140
You splash out on professing your love.

255
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,940
You even hired a makeup artist.

256
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,670
Wang Xinyu specifically emphasized

257
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,520
the need to have the most perfect makeup.

258
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,520
It can amaze him at the first glance.

259
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,730
You know I'm not good at makeup.

260
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,990
I'd just have to hire a makeup artist.

261
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,520
After this, I'll go directly to the swimming pool to meet Ren Chu.

262
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,280
Bah!

263
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,450
Don't say that.

264
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,300
My eyelid is twitching.

265
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,160
Nothing bad would happen, right?

266
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,620
Shut your mouth!

267
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,630
Nothing bad will happen.

268
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,100
Even if something happens, it'll be a good thing.

269
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,490
But why do I feel flustered?

270
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,630
You feel flustered and your eyelid is twitching

271
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,230
because you didn't sleep well.

272
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,530
Don't be superstitious.

273
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:34,930
We are medical students.

274
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,560
Do you want to sit down for a makeup too?

275
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,500
Aren't you going to the cinema with Fan Yi tonight?

276
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,230
The cinema is so dark.

277
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,210
What can we see?

278
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:48,150
This colour looks nice. I want to try.

279
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:54,910
You...

280
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,210
Do you plan to go to graduate school?

281
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,080
How did you know?

282
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,570
I went to Lu Wanwan's Baking Club yesterday.

283
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,700
Lu Wanwan again.

284
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,330
I went to get the cake from her.

285
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,280
Let's not talk about her first.

286
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,090
What is going on with you going to graduate school abroad?

287
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:15,490
My dad works overseas.

288
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,750
My mum wants to accompany him over there.

289
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,120
She hopes that I can study for a few more years that

290
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,780
our whole family can reunite.

291
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,400
This is not what I want,

292
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,790
but what they want.

293
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,390
Plus it isn't finalized yet.

294
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,570
I thought about it seriously

295
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:34,470
after knowing about studying abroad.

296
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,940
Bu if you want me to stay,

297
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:39,090
I'll continue to persuade them

298
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,420
so I don't have to go abroad.

299
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,250
But studying abroad

300
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,850
is also a great opportunity.

301
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,140
Would you like to go abroad with me

302
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,990
after graduation?

303
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,660
Would you like to?

304
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,970
I just want an answer.

305
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,290
I don't know.

306
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,230
This is so sudden.

307
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,630
I never thought about it.

308
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,680
Have you ever

309
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,960
even thought about our future?

310
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,060
Liang Xia.

311
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,150
Do you regret it?

312
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,970
If you were together with Lu Wanwan,

313
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,990
you wouldn't have to be in a situation like this.

314
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:26,000
What does this have to do with Lu Wanwan?

315
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,350
It has nothing to do with her?

316
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,650
Didn't you like her?

317
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,510
If I hadn't take the initiative to profess my love back then,

318
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,610
maybe you would've been with her.

319
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,500
She liked you too.

320
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,230
It was I who took away the person she liked.

321
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,910
I'm shameless. I stole you.

322
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,090
Liang Xia.

323
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,750
I want some time alone.

324
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,340
Please leave me alone.

325
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,310
I'm almost suffocated

326
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,870
by the elegant femininity.

327
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,870
You are a Disney princess on the run.

328
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,980
Your elegance comes to my face.

329
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,580
I'm almost suffocated by it.

330
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,319
All the best with your date.

331
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,880
All the best with the profession.

332
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,930
Never repeat the same mistakes you made

333
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,819
when you professed to An Jiaxian.

334
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:11,700
-Understand? -Don't worry.

335
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,619
I'll handle it.

336
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:14,420
I'll get going first. Good luck!

337
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,000
Lu Wanwan.

338
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,540
Wanwan.

339
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,030
I want to know

340
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,820
if you liked me before.

341
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,050
Let's talk somewhere else.

342
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,200
We don't have many days left together.

343
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:22,380
Why did I say mean things like that?

344
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,240
Why did I have to say something related to Lu Wanwan?

345
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,970
An Jiaxian must be mad at me.

346
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,610
Should I apologize to him?

347
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,240
But why it's always me that apologizes?

348
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,890
[It's our third anniversary.]

349
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:06,740
Let the past

350
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,760
be the past.

351
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,860
We have to move on.

352
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,510
Cherish the people around you.

353
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,640
You must have been sad at that time, right?

354
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,270
Indeed I was a bit sad.

355
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,930
After all, I'd liked you for a long time.

356
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,600
But I cried.

357
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,020
It's all over.

358
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,120
And now I have someone else that I like.

359
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,370
I always think about him.

360
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,440
Think about solving questions with him.

361
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,100
Sitting in the car together. Eating breakfast together.

362
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,710
I like how he looked at me and gave me strength

363
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,990
during the competition.

364
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,920
I also like that he was waiting for me at the door

365
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,160
when I came out of the hospital.

366
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,470
I wouldn't be scared,

367
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,110
because I know

368
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:06,790
he'll be there

369
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,770
for me.

370
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,390
I want

371
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,740
to be with him

372
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,000
for a long, long time.

373
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,310
You...

374
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,750
Alright. I've said all

375
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,930
I want to say.

376
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,870
Actually I didn't intend to.

377
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,340
But since it's asked,

378
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,610
I think it's better to make it clear.

379
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,380
You and Liang Xia should be sweet together.

380
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,990
In the future, you can only

381
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,600
say "sorry" specifically to her.

382
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,080
But I believe you two

383
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,260
can overcome difficulties together.

384
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,750
I really need to get going.

385
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,410
I'm in a hurry and almost late.

386
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,000
Wait, Wanwan.

387
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:17,350
Lu Wanwan! My best friend!

388
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,530
And the person I like the most!

389
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:20,250
How can you two do this?

390
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:24,150
An Jiaxian, you treat me like that

391
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,000
when I'm still coming to apologise to you!

392
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,060
Do you know today is

393
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,360
our third anniversary?

394
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,430
Your action now is the gift for me?

395
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,140
No. You misunderstood.

396
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:34,780
Explain.

397
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,030
Liang Xia, you've really misunderstood.

398
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,310
Ex...explain.

399
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,830
Liang Xia, so here is the thing.

400
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:42,930
You really misunderstood.

401
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,400
Indeed I misunderstood!

402
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,540
I misunderstood that I could impress him.

403
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,880
I misunderstood that he could like me.

404
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,650
In the end, I'm the joke.

405
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,180
You are born to be together.

406
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:53,300
An Jiaxian, why are you treating me like this?

407
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,560
I don't want to see either of you anymore.

408
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,030
Wipe it.

409
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,330
Hurry up and chase after her.

410
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,180
Tell her that I was about to fall.

411
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,780
And you hugged me because you wanted to help me.

412
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:40,040
But...

413
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,580
What about you?

414
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,130
I'm close to the campus.

415
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,390
I'll wash it up and that's fine. Hurry up.

416
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,840
Something bad always happens when I'm about to profess my love.

417
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,640
Am I doomed to be a failure?

418
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,760
When will it be my turn for sweet love?

419
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:24,050
I can't go to the swimming pool like this.

420
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:27,250
But I have to go through the swimming pool to go back to the dormitory.

421
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,550
What to do?

422
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:33,920
Never mind.

423
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,690
Why so many people?

424
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,160
What a back luck I have.

425
00:23:58,790 --> 00:23:59,420
Lu Wanwan.

426
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,360
Lu Wanwan.

427
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,890
Can you pretend you don't recognise me?

428
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:09,080
Alright. Hey, why are you late?

429
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,810
Aren't we meeting at 3 o'clock?

430
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,160
Your pretence is too fake.

431
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,630
What's wrong with your head? Why are you wrapping it?

432
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,780
Just laugh if you want to. Don't hold back.

433
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,060
I'm very tough.

434
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,300
The swimming pool is just nearby. I'll take you to wash.

435
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,790
Thank you for your jacket.

436
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,820
What's wrong with you today?

437
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,840
I put on makeup specially,

438
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,560
but bumped into An Jiaxian.

439
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,890
He gave me a hand.

440
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:49,890
Liang Xia misunderstood.

441
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:53,310
She smashed the cake when she got angry.

442
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,710
She hit you with the cake?

443
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,620
No.

444
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,090
She was mad at An Jiaxian.

445
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:59,820
So, she wanted to hit An Jiaxian.

446
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,350
But her vision wasn't good.

447
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,350
So it was me who got hit instead.

448
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,820
I'm so unlucky.

449
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,070
I wanted to come to see you beautifully.

450
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:10,460
It turned out

451
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,210
like this.

452
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:15,860
So many people have seen it.

453
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,410
I don't know how I could face it.

454
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,010
It's okay.

455
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,770
I'm here. No one would laugh at you.

456
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,780
Is your hair not properly washed yet?

457
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,310
It still smells like cream.

458
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:30,360
Impossible.

459
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,410
I washed it twice.

460
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,370
I'll help you with that.

461
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,860
What did An Jiaxian say to you?

462
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:41,300
Nothing much actually.

463
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,240
It's the old things.

464
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,360
He asked me to verify if I liked him before.

465
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:48,940
He wanted to apologize.

466
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,440
What did you say to him?

467
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,300
I liked him before.

468
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:56,180
But not anymore.

469
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,620
Now,

470
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,400
there is someone that I like.

471
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:10,260
Why did you ask me out for today?

472
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:16,460
Noting much.

473
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,400
Even if you didn't ask me out,

474
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,910
I would ask you out anyways.

475
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:21,460
I made a lab report.

476
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,810
There will be Leonid meteor shower tonight.

477
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:26,330
Do you want to go to the rooftop to observe that?

478
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:27,890
Really? Meteor shower?

479
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,720
So, what experiment are you going to do?

480
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,940
Then you want to ask me, a study slacker, to go with you?

481
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,820
Are you sure?

482
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:37,710
I'm very sure.

483
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:38,430
So,

484
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:39,900
are you free?

485
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,410
Of course!

486
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,300
Then it is confirmed.

487
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,780
Are the balloons enough?

488
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,240
If not, I'll get some more.

489
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,540
It's enough. Please get more pink ones.

490
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:02,660
Senior.

491
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,570
Is the heart I put here at the center position?

492
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:07,070
Not really.

493
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,670
Why do  you use electronic candles?

494
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,520
I saw that the weather forecast today says there is a strong wind.

495
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,780
It's safer to use this.

496
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:15,300
Junior.

497
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,490
It is speculated that

498
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,000
there will be 110 meteors across the sky

499
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
every hour between 21:00 and 00:00.

500
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,160
The radiant rises from the northeast.

501
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,550
It can be seen at northeast before moonrise.

502
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,080
Alright.

503
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,840
Should I profess my love to him directly

504
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,200
when the meteor shower comes?

505
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:43,780
How can I be like Wang Xinyu?

506
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,580
Say sweet words when I just open my mouth.

507
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,300
I like you.

508
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,960
Is it too common?

509
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,380
It's bothersome.

510
00:27:58,770 --> 00:27:59,320
Hello.

511
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,630
Wanwan, did Liang Xia contact you?

512
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,520
No. Why?

513
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,450
I didn't manage to catch her up.

514
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:06,910
She didn't pick up my call.

515
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,310
She didn't go home and didn't come back to campus.

516
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,770
I can't find her anywhere.

517
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,420
She wouldn't do something bad on herself, right?

518
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,430
Wanwan.

519
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,350
Please help me find her.

520
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:20,780
Alright.

521
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,120
Please don't panic.

522
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,060
She may just be hiding now.

523
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:27,040
Let's think about where she would be.

524
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,850
We look for her separately. Let's call each other if we found her.

525
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:30,480
Alright.

526
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,690
I have something to do temporarily.

527
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:38,290
I'll be there a little later.

528
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,600
Since I was little,

529
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,720
I like hiding at higher places

530
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,010
when I am sad.

531
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,980
You can see if there are people

532
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,120
who care about you looking for you

533
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,710
when you are at a higher place.

534
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:57,530
[I'll be there a little later.]

535
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,640
Lu Wanwan, are you lost?

536
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:53,010
Lu Wanwan, do text me

537
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:55,210
when you're delayed by something else.

538
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,800
Look here.

539
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,080
[Wanwan]

540
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,900
[Ren Chu]

541
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,120
Lu Wanwan, you're late.

542
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:23,790
I'm sorry. I have something to do temporarily.

543
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,350
I'll be there a little later.

544
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:27,320
What's wrong? Where are you?

545
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:30,510
I'm at the rooftop of Qiandao Lake.

546
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,620
The rooftop of Qiandao Lake?

547
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:34,500
I'll come to you now.

548
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:38,410
-She's gone. -She's gone.

549
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,100
In the end,

550
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,980
the person who knows me the best is you.

551
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:20,960
An Jiaxian is also looking for you. He is very worried about you.

552
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,010
There is nothing between us.

553
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,140
You misunderstood.

554
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:25,990
Come back with me.

555
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,380
I'm not going anywhere.

556
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:32,210
Go away.

557
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,070
I don't want to see you.

558
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,500
Liang Xia, it is not safe here.

559
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,180
Who will protect you if I go away?

560
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,840
I don't need your protection.

561
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,870
Do you know that

562
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,470
when I was at school,

563
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:53,420
I got bullied by even more people

564
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,720
because you always

565
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,650
stood in front of me.

566
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:00,310
They called me a coward.

567
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:04,550
They would make things difficult for me again and again.

568
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,010
I'm sorry.

569
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,680
I didn't know about these.

570
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,100
You should've told me earlier.

571
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,000
It's the same

572
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,160
when I am in a relationship with An Jiaxian.

573
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:36,800
I'd rather you

574
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:39,790
hit me,

575
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,930
or scold me.

576
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,870
But you just wanted to pretend to be magnanimous

577
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:48,980
to fulfill us.

578
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,220
You'll always be

579
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:57,090
the upright Lu Wanwan.

580
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,650
But

581
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,130
I am

582
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,870
a coward that lives in your shadow.

583
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,010
But you're the coward

584
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,770
in my heart.

585
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,720
You liked An Jiaxian for five years.

586
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,520
Yet you weren't brave enough to profess your love for him.

587
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:31,860
Now,

588
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,680
you like Ren Chu, right?

589
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,800
You dare not to tell him again, right?

590
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,100
I...

591
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,360
You're too cowardly.

592
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,520
Why are you always trying to act brave in front of me?

593
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:55,760
You're right.

594
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,540
I admit that I like Ren Chu.

595
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:04,710
Although I always keep you behind me,

596
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:07,100
I'm in fact not brave.

597
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:09,969
In a relationship,

598
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,889
I'm a coward.

599
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:19,030
But I'll face my own problem directly.

600
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,860
And you should go back with me.

601
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,960
I'm not going back. Wanwan, I'm not going back.

602
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:35,449
I'm not going back. Wanwan, I'm not going back.

603
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,810
Come on. Cheers.

604
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,150
Cheers.

605
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,150
Drink every drop.

606
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,800
Here she comes.

607
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:44,940
She's back.

608
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,800
And there's another beauty, too.

609
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,800
Hey.

610
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,570
Pretty girl, do you know how to drink alcohol?

611
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:16,860
No.

612
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:19,090
No? I'll teach you.

613
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:20,010
Bullshit!

614
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:22,520
It's I who even taught you how to drink.

615
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,040
You teach.

616
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,330
Sorry. I don't drink alcohol.

617
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,310
Let me hold your hand...

618
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,840
Let me tell you. I learned Wing Chun before.

619
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,360
My friend

620
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,080
learned

621
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,180
self-defence.

622
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:46,130
And she is drunk too.

623
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:50,370
She doesn't behave well after being drunk. It hurts when she beats people up.

624
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:51,630
If she pokes your eyes,

625
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,940
kicks your crotch later,

626
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,500
without being able to grasp the strength,

627
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,360
I'm afraid you would be disabled.

628
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,740
That wouldn't be nice.

629
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,020
Are...are you trying to scare me?

630
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:03,940
I was trained too.

631
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,930
If...if you don't believe,

632
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:08,220
come here.

633
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:09,570
You come here.

634
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,090
I...I'm not coming there.

635
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,440
What to do?

636
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,610
It can't seem to scare them.

637
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,180
I'll just have to go for it.

638
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:37,540
I only know untrained punches.

639
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,220
The fairy that is passing by, please,

640
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,980
let Ren Chu show up quickly.

641
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:43,130
If I make it through this time,

642
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:44,930
I'll profess my love for Ren Chu.

643
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,090
Ren Chu, I like you.

644
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,300
What did you just say?

645
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:37,510
A shooting star

646
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:39,950
has to pass through a long time and space

647
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,920
before it shines for a moment.

648
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,780
It's like the profession of love.

649
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:47,040
There are exquisite makeup and romance.

650
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:49,250
There are the best time and manuscript.

651
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,830
However,

652
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:52,460
missing a profession

653
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,790
doesn't mean missing each other's heart.

654
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,920
I'm glad you come.

655
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,600
I'm glad I have the courage.
