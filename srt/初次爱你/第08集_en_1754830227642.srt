00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,750
How much is the avocado?

193
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,260
Why are you here?

194
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:04,780
Fifteen yuan for two.

195
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,640
Special price.

196
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,450
Something is wrong with your explanation.

197
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,020
You'll mislead Lu Wanwan.

198
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:16,780
Ren Chu,

199
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,870
although you have good grades,

200
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,300
math and clinical departments

201
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,540
are very different.

202
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,460
The math department's thinking method

203
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,580
may not be suitable for the clinical department.

204
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,530
Besides, since childhood,

205
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,780
I've been teaching Lu Wanwan like this.

206
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,040
We share the same path.

207
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,660
You always teach her

208
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,660
by writing out the answer directly.

209
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,660
She could just look at the answers

210
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,740
on the last page directly herself.

211
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,100
Maybe this is the reason why Lu Wanwan

212
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,500
hasn't made any progress for so many years.

213
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,100
And maybe

214
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,020
I also found the reason why

215
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,180
she has such a bad temper lately.

216
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,900
Why don't we have a competition?

217
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,360
I'll be Lu Wanwan's tutor.

218
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,260
I guarantee her grades of orthopedic examination

219
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,660
will be two points higher than yours.

220
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,500
That's impossible.

221
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,300
Calm down.

222
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,700
To be fair, I'll make certain concessions.

223
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,540
I'll only do multiple-choice and True or False questions.

224
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,100
Are you crazy? Are you going to give up essay questions?

225
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,620
The professor will kill you.

226
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,620
No need for that.

227
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,500
I said two points higher.

228
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,620
If I fail,

229
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,700
my annual scholarship will be yours.

230
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,830
That's a lot of money. Are you serious?

231
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,330
Are you that confident in me?

232
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,700
I have confidence in myself.

233
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,420
Deal.

Does anyone listen to me?

236
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,940
You bet on my grades.

237
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,780
You should at least ask me first.

238
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,940
Lu! Lu!

239
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,660
Come down.

240
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,140
What's wrong?

241
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,020
There's a boy outside.

242
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,020
He's so handsome.

243
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:38,970

244
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,220
Hurry up.

The image analysis

246
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,860
is not suitable for everyone.

247
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,220
I've seen your orthopedic exams.

248
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,380
A large part of questions are aiming to test basic knowledges.

249
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,980
There are few calculations.

250
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,500
You can get the right answer

251
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,100
just by analyzing the question itself.

252
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,660
It's not that simple.

253
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:03,940
The diagnosis

254
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,090
is based on the symptoms.

255
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,580
It's not difficult.

256
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,710
You don't understand medicine at all.

257
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,340
I'm not going to bet with you.

258
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,980
I'll teach Lu Wanwan.

259
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,290
Afraid of losing?

260
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,620
This bet is meaningless.

261
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,420
Let's see who

262
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,220
can improve Lu Wanwan's grades.

263
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,060
Are you crazy?

264
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,980
Who was that boy?

265
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,100

Is the soy milk machine too noisy?

269
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,320
It's not the soy milk machine.

270
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,700
I got a phone call.

He asked me to get up and read in the morning.

-Wanwan, it's time to get up and memorize words. -And this one.

I had a fight with my mom.

So I didn't go with her.

You are afraid of staying home alone, right?

As a top student, you also tell lies.

00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,120
We're the same.

340
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,670
It's been a long time since the house was full of people last time.

341
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,760
You haven't had breakfast, right?

342
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,020
Come and eat together.

343
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,290
Sit down.

344
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:28,760
I'm full.

345
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,240
You are stepping on my tail.

346
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:37,040
Sorry.

347
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,500
You have a long tail.

Thank you, Mr. Lu.

352
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:45,770
You're welcome.

There are more.

354
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,620
Make yourself at home.

355
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,450
I can eat more.

356
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,420
Why are you here?

357
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,730
I had a fight with my mom.

358
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,390
So I didn't go abroad with her.

359
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,410
Why are you two here so early?

360
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,220
To help her with her study.

361
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,700
I betted with him to see

362
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,050
which one of us is the better tutor.

363
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,360
Aren't you going to accompany me today?

364
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,350
Right.

365
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,460
You don't have time to help me, do you?

366
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,480
Hang out with your girlfriend.

367
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,310
What's wrong with you two?

368
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:35,750
You said you wanted to keep a distance,

369
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,810
but now you're on the same side again.

370
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,800
You know nothing about girls.

371
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,780
This bet is truly a bit childish.

372
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,420
Ren Chu,

373
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,910
let's shake hands and make peace.

374
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,690
The bet can be canceled.

375
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,050
But I won't

376
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,990
shake hands and make peace with you.

377
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,050
You'll get sleepy if you eat too much.

378
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,130
Have an egg as a protein supplement.

379
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:09,730
I don't need your help.

380
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,120
I can learn by myself.

381
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,880
I don't intend to help you.

382
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:15,330
I'm just looking around.

[Ch.6 Knee Ligament Injuries]

384
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,190
Let me ask you something.

385
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,410
Fan Yi has been walking too much these days. His knees hurt.

386
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,250
Why is that?

387
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,820
Did he get injured?

388
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,280
Any other symptoms?

389
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,470
He fell down a few days ago.

390
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,070
He said his knees hurt when he turned on the air conditioner.

391
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,750
Maybe he has hydrarthrosis.

392
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,030
How to treat it?

393
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,580
Tell him not to make moves like bending knees.

394
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,510
Do the heat treatment for a few days

395
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,320
and use some anti-inflammatory medicine.

396
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:08,910
Okay.

397
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,120
I'll talk to him.

[Ch.6 Knee Ligament Injuries]

399
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,020
What if it hurts when he sits up straight, and can only stay in an awkward posture?

400
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,820
He doesn't dare to move too much,

401
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,090
especially when he gets up from a lying-down position.

402
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:28,100
Why?

403
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,070
Have you tried pressing his hip?

404
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:32,070
Does it hurt when he twist the waist?

405
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,680
He feels pain when he feels pressure on his hip.

406
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,680
The waist is fine.

407
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,140
Did he fall down and hurt his hip?

408
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:40,150
Yes.

409
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,660
Maybe his tailbone got injured.

410
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,520
Who is it again?

411
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:43,300
Fan Yi.

412
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,690
Why does Fan Yi always get injured?

413
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,220
You should take him to the hospital.

414
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,090
Okay, I'll take him there later.

415
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,980
What if he feels weak in lower limbs

416
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,110
after falling down?

417
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,930
First of all,

418
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:07,070
we need to know if it's a spinal cord injury.

419
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,600
If his lower limbs are weak,

420
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,490
it's likely to be a lumbar spinal cord injury.

421
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,980
Who is that this time?

422
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:15,430
Fan Yi.

423
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,150
He fell from height.

424
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,120
You should take him to pray in the temple

425
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,970
after taking him to the hospital.

426
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,360
We are atheists.

She can diagnose according to symptoms now,

428
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:35,220
which means she got the hang of the knowledge.

429
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,240
How did Fan Yi fall?

430
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,460
What pose?

431
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:44,490
His foot slipped.

432
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,520
He slipped and fell on his butt,

433
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,450
palm against the ground directly.

434
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,090
Like this?

435
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:53,940
I think so.

436
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,540
Would he get hurt anywhere else?

437
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,370
If he fell from height and hurt his hip,

438
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,470
his palm will take much more impact.

439
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,260
Go back and check his wrist.

440
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:08,430
He'd better have a check in the hospital.

441
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,760
Which part of the wrist?

442
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,330
What is this?

443
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,210
Triquetral bone.

444
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,430
Here.

445
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,150
Press here gently

446
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,350
and see if it's swollen when you go back.

447
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:40,560
Okay.

448
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,400
What a coincidence.

449
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:52,870
Fan Yi

450
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:56,070
happened to have all the common injuries in orthopedics.

451
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,710
Are you trying

452
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,710
to tutor me?

453
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,100
You think too much.

454
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:01,860
He's unlucky.

455
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:02,990
There's nothing I can do.

456
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:03,700
Really?

457
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,130
I'll take you somewhere.

458
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:05,930
I'm not going.

459
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,000
I want to study.

460
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:09,050
Let's go somewhere else to study.

461
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,470
Didn't you say we'd study somewhere else?

462
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:22,730
Why do you take me here?

463
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,530
We should leave some time for fun while working hard.

464
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,000
You've been studying all morning.

465
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,010
If you keep doing that,

466
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:28,810
you won't have high efficiency.

467
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,410
There are no subtitles.

468
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,250
I chose this mode on purpose.

469
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,520
Listen carefully.

470
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,230
Practice your oral English.

471
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,420
Didn't you say we should leave some time for fun?

472
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,180
I thought about it.

473
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:03,300
You're right.

474
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,700
You should focus on your study.

475
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:12,450
Seriously?

476
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,170
You hid the battery?

477
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:16,190
Do you think I'm that kind of person

478
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:18,520
who got no perseverance to make progress?

479
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:20,010
You look down on me.

480
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,580
It's just a movie without subtitles.

481
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,710
My English is good.

482
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,660
Then watch it carefully.

483
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:27,910
The interleaving study is very effective.

484
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:29,590
You've got plenty of specialized courses.

485
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,230
The final exam is stressful.

486
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:33,960
For a basic course like English,

487
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,220
you can just learn it by watching movies.

488
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:38,030
Just watch movies.

489
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,510
That's how a straight A student studies?

490
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,910
I just can't understand every sentence.

491
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,250
Finally, it's over.

492
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,150
How do you feel?

493
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,830
Matt Damon is so handsome!

And?

How did the hero get in touch with the Earth?

498
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:17,970
How did the female captain in the spaceship

499
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:20,110
persuade everyone to go back to pick up the hero?

500
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:20,870
And,

501
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,100
you have to repeat

502
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,900
the data recorded by the hero when he plants potatoes later.

503
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,430
What are you talking about?

00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,160
Watch it again.

505

Think about my questions

506
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,920
and watch it carefully.

507
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:34,690
No way.

508
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:37,490
I need to answer questions while watching a movie?

509

You're not going on vacation?

511
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:39,670
It'll be a waste of your visa and flight tickets.

00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:45,010
I don't want to leave you.

513
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:47,350
It's just a vacation.

I won't run away.

517

518
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,270
apologize to your mother later.

519
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,510

Why do you ask this all of a sudden?

523
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,300
It just occurred to me.

524
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,470
So I just said it out.

I feel that's insecure.

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Not necessarily.

As long as they're in love,

551
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:14,530

566
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:32,850
Then I don't think it's necessary to tell you that.

567
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,560
You handled it very well.

568
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:39,120
The young man who came this morning...

569
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,380
I think he's a good lad.

570
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,240
What's his name...

571
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,110
Ren Chu.

572
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,380
He is better than An Jiaxian.

573
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,690
Mom, what are you talking about?

574
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:50,750
I want to play games.

575
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,810
You can go to sleep.

576
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:56,590
Okay.

577
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,570
Go to bed early.

578
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,720
[Your friend Wang Yuyang is online.]

579
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,180
Don't you have to study hard?

580
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,580
Why are you still online?

581
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:31,410
I've been learning for a day.

582
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:36,020
Aren't you afraid your competitor will surpass you?

583
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:41,570
I just saw the competitor's report card.

584
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:43,630
I just need to play a game to calm down.

585

[Liang Xia]

586
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,490
Are you trying to

587
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,810
get the opportunity to study abroad?

588
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,160
You already know that?

589
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,940
Actually, my mom

590
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,470
wanted to take me to see the university there.

591
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,730
My dad has been working abroad,

592
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,100
and my mom wants to accompany him.

593
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,350
So she hopes I could go with them.

594
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,430
I quarreled with my mom

595
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:50,030
because she arranged everything

596
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,860
without asking me for my opinion.

597
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,290
Does An Jiaxian know it?

598
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,070
I haven’t told him yet.

599
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,230
I don't know what to say.

600
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:10,310
You'd better tell him the truth.

601
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,390
I think no matter what,

602
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:16,670
you have to handle this together.

603
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,550
You can't bear it alone.

604
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,740
An Jiaxian is so considerate.

605
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,220
He will understand.

606
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,000
Wanwan.

607
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,940
The message you sent me back then,

608
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:35,010
saying that you wish An Jiaxian and I could be happy together.

609
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:36,140
I thought

610
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:39,990
you were just saying that out of politeness.

611
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,620
I didn't expect you really meant it.

612
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,860
At that time,

613
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,980
I was acting tough.

614
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,970
Actually, I was very confused.

615
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,370
But when I heard you said

616
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,810
you were about to study abroad,

617
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,260
I really don't want you to go.

618
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,360
I think nothing else matters.

619
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,159
I don't want to leave you either.

620
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:14,320
Fortunately,

621
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,420
you have Ren Chu by your side.

622
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:29,610
Ren Chu

623
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,710
did help me a lot.

624
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:32,840
But

625
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:35,400
every time

626
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,340
I started to think he's a nice guy,

627
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,230
his action

628
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:42,670
would prove that he's unreasonable.

629
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,110
Same thing happened this time.

630
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:46,659
And your An Jiaxian.

631
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,080
He's always been the calm one.

632
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,230
But this time he acted so competitive.

633
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:53,340
Boys are so weird.

634
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:55,810
Your boyfriend Ren Chu is weird.

635
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,460
He's like an aggressive roaster.

636
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,480
He's not my boyfriend!

637
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,320
Don't talk nonsense.

638
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,320
You're stubborn.

Bro Wan,

694
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,660

I've thought it through.

704
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,500
You just can't have all the benefits at once.

what do you think of Ren Chu?

733
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:52,020
Do you feel any impulse when looking at him?

734
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,140
The impulse to ask him questions?

735
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,040
The impulse to fall in love.

736
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:58,700
Shut up.

737
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:01,340
Ren Chu is a nice guy.

738
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,380
He can also be a good boyfriend, maybe.

739
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,100
But I'm not going to date in college.

740
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:11,800
