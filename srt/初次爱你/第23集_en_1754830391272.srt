5
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,009
Could anyone

6
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:09,100
tell me

7
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,699
what's going on?

8
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,500
My pre-internship is over.

9
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,900
Ren Chu suggested

10
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,140
we could go out and have fun.

11
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,740
To take a break.

12
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,140
Wanwan,

13
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,620
what do you think of my arrangement?

14
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,420
Very good.

15
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,340
It's like a trip I've been dreaming of.

16
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,340
Wait. Cousin-in-law,

17
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,860
are you so easily satisfied?

18
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,579
It's not about where to go,

19
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,860
the most important thing is that someone has booked the ticket and hotel and made the schedule for me.

20
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,940
I don't have to worry about anything.

21
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:40,300
I've been looking forward to such a trip

22
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,050
for a long time.

23
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,060
Then why did you ask me to go with you?

24
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,300
Appreciate your display of affection?

25
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,730
Wang Xinyu,

26
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,020
look,

27
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,620
it's such a wonderful trip.

28
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,020
Can I invite you to go with me?

29
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,780
I heard you finished your report-back performance

30
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,330
and have two days off.

31
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,900
It's inappropriate.

32
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,420
We're not a couple.

33
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:05,780
No.

34
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,020
We booked a homestay.

35
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,500
There are four bedrooms.

36
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,100
You can sleep upstairs with Lu Wanwan.

37
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,700
Ren Chu and I will sleep downstairs.

38
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,740
I promise

39
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,340
I won't disturb you.

40
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,340
I won't make you uncomfortable.

41
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,180
Your performance is over.

42
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,860
Then you should take a break.

43
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,620
Maybe

44
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,740
after the travel,

45
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,540
you can study more efficiently.

46
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,780
Besides, you haven't traveled

47
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,180
with Meng Xibai before, right?

48
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:33,420
Take this opportunity

49
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,420
to deepen your relationship.

50
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,010
Cousin-in-law,

51
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,420
you have a point.

52
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,700
I'll go.

53
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,220
Since we're going hiking,

54
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,650
shouldn't we buy

55
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,620
something like an interchange jackets or climbing rods?

56
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,260
I did some research.

57
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,380
There's a a specialty store

58
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,780
of mountaineering outfits in this mall.

59
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,940
Let's take a look.

60
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,140
Cousin-in-law,

61
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,980
what's the most important thing when traveling?

62
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,820
Stay beautiful!

63
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,260
Just listen to me.

64
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,940
Cousin-in-law,

65
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:11,980
do you know what else should be concerned about

66
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,250
when traveling?

67
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,090
Money?

68
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:14,930
No.

69
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,300
A pair of comfortable slippers?

70
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,019
No.

71
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:17,980
Then what is it?

72
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:22,340
Safety precautions for couples for a sleepover.

73
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,900
Don't get me wrong.

74
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,940
I mean,

75
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,540
you have to be beautiful spending the night together.

76
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,940
Prepare the tone-up cream,

77
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,620
night powder puff,

78
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,050
and sexy pajamas.

79
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,100
That's too elaborate.

80
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,820
By the way,

81
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,100
what's going on between you and Meng Xibai?

82
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,060
I don't think

83
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,020
you didn't want to travel with us.

84
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,260
Of course I do.

85
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,740
I just don't want to waste my time practicing.

86
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,140
To be honest,

87
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,580
I practiced dancing so hard

88
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,210
just to take revenge on Xibai.

89
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,460
I wanted him to regret dumping me one day.

90
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,380
But gradually, I got used to it.

91
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,820
I feel nervous when I don't practice for some reason.

92
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,700
I realized that

93
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,500
I really love dancing in my heart.

94
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,730
I value the stage very much.

95
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,940
In this matter,

96
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,540
I need to thank Xibai.

97
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,500
This is the first time

98
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,780
you talk to me so happily about

99
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,540
something unrelated to Xibai.

100
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,740
Since you thank him so much,

101
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,220
why don't you get back together right now?

102
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,580
Of course I want to.

103
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,140
But it was he who dumped me first.

104
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,980
He should be the one who clears the air proactively.

105
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,409
So this time, I have to hold on.

106
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:36,380
I need to be reserved.

107
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,780
I won't say it first.

108
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,980
To grasp both your study and your love.

109
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,060
That's good.

110
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,350
Give it to me.

111
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,580
It's only two days and one night.

112
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,860
You brought so many things?

113
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,780
These are prepared by me and Wang Xinyu

114
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,140
especially for traveling.

115
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,660
Where are Meng Xibai and Wang Xinyu?

116
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,260
They decided to drive to the destination.

117
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,220
Drive?

118
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,010
It only takes one and a half hours by plane.

119
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,620
Why do they want to drive there?

120
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,530
Wang Xinyu told me

121
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,820
since she had sacrificed her time for dancing,

122
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,140
she must enjoy the romance

123
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,460
as much as possible.

124
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,140
She wants to experience a sense of elopement

125
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,940
like in those road movies.

126
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,000
Then my senior agreed?

127
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:36,970
Meng Xibai went to rent a car.

128
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:37,980
They left early in the morning.

129
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,180
They'll arrive in nine hours if they're fast enough.

130
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:42,659
This...

131
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,860
That's undoubtedly true love.

132
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,290
My senior cherishes his life very much.

133
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,970
I can't believe he agreed to drive

134
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,850
for nine hours.

135
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,060
That would be a pretty long journey.

136
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,659
Is it love?

137
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,220
I think it's responsibility.

138
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,300
It's...

139
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,340
so boring.

140
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,320
Let's go.

141
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,100
Xinyu,

142
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,300
you look great today.

143
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,570
Louder the music!

144
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,659
Can't we listen to something else?

145
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:44,820
I was afraid of the bad reception,

146
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,380
so I downloaded this program.

147
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,180
It can also alert us all the way.

148
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,260
Xinyu,

149
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,370
don't you love watching shows?

150
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,180
I like variety shows,

151
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,040
not legal programs.

152
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,300
Xinyu,

153
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,900
don't open the window on the highway.

154
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,980
It will affect the balance of the car.

155
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,420
If you feel hot,

156
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,500
I'll turn on the air conditioner.

157
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,580
Xibai,

158
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,820
is my hat beautiful?

159
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,100
Xinyu, wait a minute.

160
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,980
I'll take a closer look when we stop at the service area later.

161
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,419
Xinyu,

162
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,340
your hat

163
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,180
is too big.

164
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,860
It has blocked my rearview mirror.

165
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,700
Can you take it off?

166
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,460
You're so great.

167
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,700
That's good.

168
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,500
It's not a compliment!

169
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,140
Really?

170
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,380
You seem familiar with this place.

171
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,340
I used to participate in competitions in other places.

172
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,980
So I've come to the airport so many times.

173
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,540
When I was young,

174
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,580
I hated airports the most.

175
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,210
My parents often gave speeches in other places,

176
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,730
so they always said goodbye to me at the airport.

177
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,580
But now I don't hate it anymore.

178
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,180
I think this place is not that bad.

179
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,020
We meet at the airport occasionally,

180
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,380
and then we can have a meal together.

181
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,220
Ren Chu.

182
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,540
No way...

183
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,820
We happened to meet your parents here?

184
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,030
What if you're right?

185
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,230
It's our son.

186
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,980
We thought it was you from afar.

187
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,100
It turns out we really meet you here.

188
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,620
Long time no see.

189
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,300
You've become stronger.

190
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,420
Where are you going?

191
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,900
Dad, Mom.

192
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,100
Let me introduce.

193
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,740
This is my girlfriend, Lu Wanwan.

194
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,620
Nice to meet you, Mr. and Mrs. Ren.

195
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,740
My name is Lu Wanwan.

196
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,380
This is the first time we have met.

197
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,490
Nice to meet you.

198
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,460
This kid

199
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,260
is cuter than his aunt described.

200
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:17,900
Where are you going?

201
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,260
The course research is over.

202
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,700
We're going to travel to Yingzhou.

203
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,570
We will leave in an hour and a half.

204
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:25,940
When do you leave?

205
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,820
This is the first time we meet Wanwan.

206
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,940
Let's have a meal together if you have time.

207
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,130
We leave in an hour.

208
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,420
There's still time.

209
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,490
Your mother and I will check at counter K.

210
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,170
We'll go there first.

211
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,540
See you later at the security check.

212
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,340
See you there.

213
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:39,950
Okay.

214
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,550
See you later.

215
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,220
She's pretty nice.

216
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,500
She is very lovely.

217
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,620
Hello, Mrs. Ren.

218
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,620
My name is Lu Wanwan.

219
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,380
I'm a sophomore in the clinical department of Qingyao University.

220
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,380
Nice to meet you.

221
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,940
I'm shaking my legs because of

222
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,780
my uncoordinated contractions of active

223
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,340
and antagonistic muscles.

224
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,140
I have a dopamine drop now.

225
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,900
I don't have the habit of shaking my legs at usual time.

226
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,700
Please don't mind.

227
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,820
Kid, don't be nervous.

228
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,340
Medical students

229
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,100
are smart and capable,

230
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,220
and are willing to work hard.

231
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,420
You're excellent.

232
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,380
Yes.

233
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,820
She is really nice.

234
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,220
She can make desserts

235
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,020
and has built a nutritious club at school.

236
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,620
She's now a pre-intern in the hospital.

237
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,100
Her teacher likes her very much

238
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,300
and keeps praising her.

239
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,100
And also, she did very well in her exams last semester.

240
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,380
She made great progress.

241
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,420
I can see that Wanwan is excellent.

242
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,060
My son,

243
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,860
you didn't talk much before.

244
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,740
Now you're quite talkative.

245
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,300
I've never heard you compliment anyone before.

246
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,530
I thought you were a persona non grata

247
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,500
at school.

248
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,180
No, he's not.

249
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,500
Ren Chu is excellent.

250
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,260
Many people in the school like him

251
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,210
and even admire him.

252
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,980
Mr. Ren, let me tell you.

253
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,980
Once,

254
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,620
he was sleeping in the school swimming pool.

255
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,900
I saw from afar and found

256
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,500
someone floating in the water.

257
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,820
I was almost scared to death.

258
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,100
I thought someone was drowning.

259
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,780
Dear passengers. May I have your attention, please.

260
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,820
The flight number...

261
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,020
Dad, Mom.

262
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,820
-We should go boarding now. -...starts boarding now.

263
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,380
We'll leave now.

264
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,020
Take care.

265
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,540
Okay.

266
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,140
Wanwan,

267
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,340
I hope we can meet soon.

268
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,020
Have a safe journey.

269
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,020
Goodbye, Mr. and Mrs. Ren.

270
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,060
Bye.

271
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,340
Dad, Mom.

272
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,300
I'll leave then.

273
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,140
Wait a minute.

274
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:32,790
Let's go.

275
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,260
What did you say to your parents?

276
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:48,900
Nothing important.

277
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,330
They asked me to treat you well.

278
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,580
I thought the professors were so serious.

279
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,580
I didn't expect

280
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,860
your parents

281
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,500
to be quite friendly.

282
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,380
You are not nervous now, huh?

283
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,860
I wasn't ready just now.

284
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,220
What film do you want to watch?

285
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,500
The Conjuring.

286
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,660
Thriller.

287
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,220
Aren't you afraid?

288
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,060
I've watched countless thrillers.

289
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,460
Besides,

290
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,180
I was scared by you just now.

291
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,300
Now I'd like to see the conjuring

292
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,300
to recover.

293
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,300
Wanwan?

294
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,580
Don't watch it if you're scared.

295
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,380
I'm not scared.

296
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,820
Continue your reading.

297
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,620
I can still hold on for a while.

298
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,980
This villa is huge

299
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,020
and has a high rating.

300
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,060
The surrounding environment is good

301
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,100
and quiet.

302
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,810
I think you'll like this place.

303
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,020
We should have booked a hotel.

304
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,100
This is just like the horror house

305
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,540
in the movie.

306
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,250
It's okay.

307
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,700
That's just a squirrel.

308
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,500
The two rooms downstairs are mine and Meng Xibai's.

309
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,980
You and Wang Xinyu live upstairs.

310
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,780
Do you want to go upstairs to see your room

311
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,060
and take a rest?

312
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,220
Okay.

313
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,940
They won't arrive until midnight.

314
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,420
Let's go out and eat something.

315
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,500
I don't want to go out.

316
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,180
Then...

317
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,780
What about we order takeout?

318
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,260
Okay.

319
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,859
We have to get up early tomorrow.

320
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:17,460
Go upstairs and take a shower before resting.

321
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,060
If you're afraid,

322
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,780
you can sleep in my room. I...

323
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:23,660
I'm not scared.

324
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:27,180
I'm going back to my room.

325
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:28,500
I'll go up with you.

326
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,580
I'll be downstairs all the time.

327
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,660
If you're afraid,

328
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,970
come to find me at any time.

329
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:42,660
No problem.

330
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,060
As a materialistist,

331
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,020
I won't be scared by a horror movie.

332
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,210
I'm very experienced.

333
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,460
Don't worry.

334
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,060
-Good night. -Good night.

335
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,300
Why hasn't Wang Xinyu arrive yet?

336
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,370
It's already been nine hours.

337
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:37,480
Xibai,

338
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,660
where are we?

339
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,220
Almost there.

340
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,370
Just 100 kilometers to go.

341
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,100
Let's go now. It's late.

342
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,180
Xinyu.

343
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:51,980
Wait.

344
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,180
Your lumbar spine must feel tired after sitting for so long.

345
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,930
Come on, let's do some exercise.

346
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,820
Xinyu.

347
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,380
Join me.

348
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,780
No need, Xibai.

349
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,780
I don't know how to do it.

350
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,660
I can teach you.

351
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,580
I'm not interested.

352
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,700
What about five-animal exercises?

353
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,340
I know it. too

354
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,940
Alright.

355
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,980
Let's go after you finish.

356
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,180
Didn't they say that showing my specialties to her

357
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,290
can make me attractive?

358
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,380
Why is she so indifferent?

359
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,380
Did I eat something unclean?

360
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,780
Intermittent dull pain and distension

361
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,140
in my right lower abdomen.

362
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,540
The pain position remains the same.

363
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,730
Appendicitis.

364
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,300
I didn't bring antibiotics or anti-inflammatory drugs.

365
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,740
I just need to get some sleep.

366
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,180
It's...

367
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,420
It's Meng Xibai and Wang Xinyu. They've arrived.

368
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,180
The lights are off.

369
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,060
Was I hallucinating?

370
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,380
Don't touch my feet!

371
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,980
What happened?

372
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,820
I have appendicitis.

373
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,340
I'll take you to the hospital now.

374
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,900
Or I'll buy you some medicine.

375
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,740
We have to cancel the schedule tomorrow.

376
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,010
We can't go hiking.

377
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:23,900
No need.

378
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,740
I have chronic appendicitis,

379
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,100
which can only be cured by surgery.

380
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,890
I want to...

381
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,380
sleep with you.

382
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,100
That's not what I meant.

383
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,420
Don't get me wrong.

384
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,020
You may not believe me,

385
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,290
but I just heard a terrible scream.

386
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,650
Can I stay with you tonight?

387
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,420
I'll sleep on the floor over there.

388
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,540
I swear

389
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,860
I won't do anything.

390
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,940
I'd better sleep at the door.

391
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,940
Let me sleep by your side!

392
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,340
I swear I won't do anything.

393
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:22,980
No.

394
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,530
Patient

395
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,900
should sleep on the bed.

396
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,250
Then you'll sleep on the floor?

397
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,660
I'll sleep by your side.

398
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,180
I don't think that's appropriate.

399
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,500
You came to my room alone.

400
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,700
Are you still afraid that I'm a bad guy?

401
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,850
I have confidence in you,

402
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,010
but I have no confidence in myself.

403
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:08,090
Aren't you afraid of falling?

404
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,610
I don't move much when sleeping.

405
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,260
So I won't fall.

406
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,140
Come here.

407
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,220
What?

408
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,200
Have some hot water.

409
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,130
It'll make you feel more comfortable.

410
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,980
"You don't get

411
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,700
to choose if you get hurt in this world. Oh man.

412
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:04,700
But you do have some say in who hurts you.

413
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,540
I like my choices.

414
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,700
I hope she likes hers."

415
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,540
Meng Xibai!

416
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,380
What's wrong?

417
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,900
Xinyu, what's wrong?

418
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,690
Why didn't I take off my clothes?

419
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,060
What's wrong with you?

420
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,380
Just let me sleep like this

421
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,420
without doing anything?

422
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,140
I wanted to change clean clothes for you.

423
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,860
But when I was taking off your shoes,

424
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,300
you suddenly kicked me.

425
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,420
You took off my shoes?

426
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,700
And then?

427
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,060
I thought you woke up,

428
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,260
but you lay down again.

429
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,260
I was worried about you.

430
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,700
Besides, Lu Wanwan was sleeping upstairs,

431
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,180
so I couldn't send you back to your room.

432
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,140
Therefore I stayed on the couch all night.

433
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,900
Xinyu,

434
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,500
I swear

435
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,460
I didn't do anything to offend you.

436
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,980
I bought my sexy pajamas for nothing.

437
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,380
What a waste.

438
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,300
It's not what you think.

439
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,210
Then what?

440
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,540
Last night,

441
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,740
I heard a very terrible scream.

442
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,700
Did you hear it?

443
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,340
I came here because I was scared.

444
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:57,940
Cousin-in-law,

445
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,460
I helped you a lot.

446
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,340
I'm so sleepy.

447
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,250
Xinyu,

448
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,180
take a shower and go to bed.

449
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,610
I'll take your luggage upstairs.

450
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:51,460
Xinyu,

451
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,590
this is my room.

452
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,630
Yours is upstairs.

453
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,290
I'm so sleepy.

454
00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:00,800
[Searching]

455
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,740
How to remove the makeup?

456
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:06,540
First, use the makeup remover.

457
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,620
Xinyu,

458
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,410
where is your makeup remover?

459
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,860
Xinyu?

460
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,180
In my suitcase.

461
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,620
Makeup remover...

462
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,140
Don't touch my feet!

463
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,100
This is the nutritious breakfast I prepared for you guys.

464
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,900
Are you studying nutrition now?

465
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,340
It's been a while.

466
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:10,900
Is it good?

467
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,260
Pretty good.

468
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,140
This direction suits you very much.

469
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,180
Keep trying.

470
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,300
You look pale.

471
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,140
Both your Qi and blood are deficient.

472
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,100
Ren Chu,

473
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,730
you should take care of yourself.

474
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:33,940
Don't overwork yourself.

475
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,180
After all, we're going hiking today.

476
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,700
Don't be too indulgent

477
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,180
even though you are still young.

478
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:41,870
Cousin-in-law,

479
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,840
what did you two do last night?

480
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,490
We did nothing.

481
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:48,040
I fell asleep as soon as I lay down.

482
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:48,970
The bed is comfortable.

483
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,150
The quilt is soft.

484
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,780
When I wake up,

485
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,250
my appendicitis has recovered.

486
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,480
Ren Chu,

487
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,040
didn't you sleep well?

488
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,890
I know you've recovered.

489
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,780
Otherwise, you wouldn't have been so energetic last night.

490
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,000
Gosh.

491
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,390
Why are there so many people?

492
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:43,570
Well,

493
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,580
you guys go to park the car.

494
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,510
I'll go first and buy the tickets.

495
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,760
Then we won't have to wait in line.

496
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,810
Let's finish it quickly,

497
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:48,940
and go back to school after hiking.

498
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:50,710
No need...

499
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:51,460
Xinyu!

500
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,650
-Wait! -I'll go with you.

501
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:53,480
I'll go.

502
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,280
You and Xibai park the car and come to find us later.

503
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,260
Xinyu!

504
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,070
Wang Xinyu!

505
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:06,870
I heard you have chronic appendicitis.

506
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,260
You need to observe it carefully.

507
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,320
Tell me if you need surgery.

508
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,580
I'll make an appointment for you.

509
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,330
It's bad for your health

510
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:13,760
if you wait too long.

511
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,020
Thank you.

512
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,110
I'm fine now.

513
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,690
What about you and Wang Xinyu?

514
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,090
I think we're good.

515
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,230
It's not enough for you to feel good.

516
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,870
Her feeling is more important.

517
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,210
What should I do?

518
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,810
You should take the initiative.

519
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:32,910
She used to work so hard

520
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:34,550
when she pursued you.

521
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,480
Yes.

522
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,130
I should work harder.

523
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,450
That's a sincere advice.

524
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,750
Thanks.

525
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,080
By the way,

526
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,430
what about you and Ren Chu?

527
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,230
We're fine.

528
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,630
I heard it can be challenging to keep a long-distance relationship.

529
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,650
Our long-distance relationship is over.

530
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:58,620
It's over?

531
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,150
I saw a document at the postgraduate institute.

532
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:04,330
Ren Chu plans to have a one-year exchange

533
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:06,300
for the project outside our school.

534
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,780
You... Don't you know that?

535
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,409
[Ren Chu]

536
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,260
Hello?

537
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,070
Okay. Okay.

538
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:20,880
I'll come now.

539
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,520
What's wrong?

540
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,530
Xinyu sprained her ankle.

541
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,230
Why are you running so fast?

542
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,659
No one is chasing behind you.

543
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:31,960
Will the mountain run away?

544
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:33,659
I...

545
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:34,780
Xinyu.

546
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,790
Are you okay? Let me check.

547
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,850
I'm fine. I just sprained my ankle.

548
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,030
Try to move slowly.

549
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,239
Take off your shoe and let me check.

550
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:58,380
I'm really fine, Xibai.

551
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,940
I’m a doctor.

552
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,660
I'll be the judge of that.

553
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:03,920
Xinyu,

554
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,280
you are a dancer.

555
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,800
What if your foot injury is not dealt with in time

556
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,560
and affects your dancing in the future?

557
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,950
Be good. Let me have a look.

558
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,940
Okay, but you need to be prepared.

559
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,290
The feet of dancers are ugly.

560
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:20,010
So I don't want you to see my ugly foot.

561
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:22,610
Kicking you last night was my instinct.

562
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,040
No.

563
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,770
You're always pretty.

564
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,580
Because it's you.

565
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,510
You look pretty all the time.

566
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,720
It doesn't look serious now.

567
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,900
Let me carry you down the mountain first.

568
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,200
Let's go back to the car to do a rehabilitation treatment.

569
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:00,500
Why didn't he tell me about the exchange program?

570
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,510
We'll be separated for a year.

571
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:06,000
Does he like the feeling of a long-distance relationship?

572
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,310
That's why he doesn't think it's a big problem.

573
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,440
But I can't.

574
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,040
I don't want a long-distance relationship.

575
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:14,690
Give me your hand.

576
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,630
Is it because I've been acting so independent

577
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:30,570
that makes him think that I don't care about it?

578
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:33,300
I also want to be lovey-dovey with him.

579
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,190
Doesn't he want to be lovey-dovey with me?

580
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,070
Be careful!

581
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,940
Are you tired?

582
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:43,840
There's a small peak ahead.

583
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,310
The scenery is beautiful.

584
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:46,650
Let’s take a look

585
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:48,710
and meet up with Xibai.

586
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:50,010
It's close.

587
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:51,190
Hang in there.

588
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,250
Let's go.

589
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,880
Does it hurt?

590
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:01,140
Yes.

591
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:03,200
It must've been hard for you.

592
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,850
I'm sorry.

593
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,950
To force you to practice dancing,

594
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,420
I even broke up with you.

595
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,270
Xinyu,

596
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,340
let me take care of you, okay?

597
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,440
I hope

598
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,700
I'm the one always standing beside you.

599
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,550
I hope I can be your personal doctor

600
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,690
for the rest of my life.

601
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:31,340
I also hope

602
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,730
the first person I see every day when I wake up is you.

603
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:35,540
I also hope

604
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:39,400
you can give me another chance.

605
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,830
Let's start over.

606
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:44,320
Well,

607
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,330
are you free?

608
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,990
I want to arrange

609
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:52,050
our dating schedule.

610
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:54,060
I'm available anytime.

611
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,790
Did you touch my hand

612
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:58,350
after touching my foot?

613
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,110
Sorry.

614
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,790
I'm just kidding.

615
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:08,380
Stand up.

616
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:10,990
Stand up. Hurry up.

617
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,320
I announce that

618
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,790
we got back together.

619
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:30,390
I'm your senior's girlfriend from now on.

620
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,060
Cousin.

621
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,830
I'm the girlfriend of your girlfriend's senior.

622
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:34,510
Show some respect now.

623
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:35,810
Congratulations.

624
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,110
Congratulations.

625
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,500
Thank you.

626
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,970
We still have time.

627
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:42,320
Let me take you to a place.

628
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:46,520
[Fang Cun Art Museum]

629
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,110
Art museum?

630
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,680
Cousin,

631
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,240
did you specially bring me here?

632
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,340
You also think I have a sense of artistry?

633
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,400
You're too crazy for that.

634
00:38:58,610 --> 00:38:59,790
I just want to take Wanwan here.

635
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:02,310
Follow me.

636
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:24,780
Wait for me here.

637
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,000
Wanwan.

638
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,900
What does this green light mean?

639
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:52,830
Love is a ray of green light,

640
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,140
and it's so green that makes you feel flustered.

641
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:58,500
Do you like it?

642
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,390
This is a gift for you.

643
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:05,220
It's quite special.

644
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:06,950
Just...

645
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,760
make me feel a little flustered.

646
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:12,190
Actually,

647
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,000
we can stop sight penetration

648
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,130
whether there's light

649
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:16,520
or not.

650
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,170
This principle is like

651
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,600
we can't see the stars during the day.

652
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,910
Only when the light around the stars weakened

653
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,810
can the stars show themselves.

654
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:28,950
Similarly,

655
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,010
we can't see love,

656
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:33,110
although it exists

657
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:34,660
infinitely

658
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:36,090
and eternally.

659
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,990
So I thought a way

660
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:40,840
to fill this room with green light

661
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:43,190
and give it to you.

662
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:49,260
♫I'll accompany you from rain to sunny♫

663
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:48,610
Light is an electromagnetic wave that

664
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,750
has its own wavelength.

665

♫Let's enjoy the scenery along the way♫

666
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:56,080

♫Although it's quiet to stand side by side♫

668
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,350

♫Your voice just got in my head♫

671

It means,

672
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,000
"I love you".

673
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:10,470
♫You stay by my side and make everything transparent♫

674
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:09,560

♫I want to live in your heart forever♫

684
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:23,890
I asked them for a little favor from the curator

685
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:25,020
