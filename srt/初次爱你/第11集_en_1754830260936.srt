Lucky draw for competitions and studies.

7
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,690
There are so many kinds that you can't miss out on!

8
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,259
Just sit. Don't move.

9
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,220
Where are you going?

10
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,820
We're going to sign up for the professional competition of the clinical department.

11
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,750
Are you in a team?

12
00:01:57,979 --> 00:01:59,060
It's the first time participating.

13
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,940
Lu Wanwan never dared to sign up before.

14
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,460
I didn't expect her to take the initiative to participate this year.

15
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,790
So I must accompany her.

16
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,660
As for you,

17
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,259
your leg isn't healed yet but you come out again.

18
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:10,060
Qiao, it isn't healed yet.

19
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,060
Please be gentle.

20
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,940
After all, I was the one who sent you to the hospital.

21
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,600
At least you must listen to what the doctor says.

22
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,579
I'll listen to the doctor and you.

23
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,060
It was too boring staying at the dormitory.

24
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,380
It's so happened that the student union held an event.

25
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,579
Then, I come out to help.

26
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:30,180
Come on, have a draw.

27
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,910

The King of the sea?

31
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,420
There are explanations at the back.

32
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,540
Sit down first.

33
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,140
You're the personal disciple of a slacking-off family.

34
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,579
Sometimes it is possible to achieve great results

35
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:33,240
despite putting in no effort.

36
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,579
When did I ever slack off?

37
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:35,500
I didn't.

38
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,560
Just believe it. It's very accurate.

39
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,180
You're a MVP of a crush.

40
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,780
It's accurate and inaccurate at the same time.

41
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,180
Five years of crushing on someone didn't come to what I would expect.

42
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,780
I would only have another crush

43
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,780
if I'm out of my mind.

44
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,700
Besides, who can I have a crush on?

45
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,380
Ren Chu.

46
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,660
No! I don't! Don't talk nonsense.

47
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,780
That's impossible.

48
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,540
I can't have a crush on Ren Chu.

49
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,500
I can't even get

50
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,180
elementary geniuses like An Jiaxian and Wang Yuyang,

51
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,300
not to mention Ren Chu.

52
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,360
What nonsense are you talking about?

53
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,470
Why are you here?

54
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,540
I'm going to meet Wang Xinyu.

55
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,800
He Yifeng and Zheng Yan went to training.

56
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,790
You didn't bring your dorm key.

57
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,020
Do you have a key performance indicator for the draw?

58
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,340
Just for fun, you won't become stupid anyways.

59
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,780
Also, they have both done it too.

60
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,340
Right?

61
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,110
What did you get?

62
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,800
It is meaningless.

63
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,150
Hurry up to sign up! We're going to be late.

64
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,030
Is that a reaction of being shy?

65
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:29,030
This is not a lucky draw. It is clearly a curse charm.

66
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,180
Whose is this?

67
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,820
It reads here the MVP of a crush.

68
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,900
It's accurate and inaccurate at the same time.

69
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,420
Is... is this from our class?

70
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,940
-Right -Who is this? -Yours?

71
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,380
Shouldn't we all believe in materialism

72
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,980
in medical schools?

73
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,700
Why do people still believe in lucky draw?

74
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,700
Have you chosen your topics? Don't bother gossiping.

75
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,460
All right, get ready for class.

76

Come!

77

79
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,940
Are you wearing this to attend a wedding?

80
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,700
Have you ever seen someone attend a wedding wearing this?

81
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,830
It's like a best man.

82
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,300
Are you going to propose?

83
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,740
I'm going to watch my girlfriend's show.

84
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,890
Forget it, you don't understand.

85
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,200
You don't even have a girlfriend.

86
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,140
Your leg

87
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,300
is still in plaster.

88
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,140
Go back and rest more.

89
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,260
You touched the tender spot.

90
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,220
Forget it.

91
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,420
There are two lucky draws here,

92
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,580
one for each of us.

93
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,910
All done. I call it a day.

94
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,420
Is it remarkable to have a girlfriend? Oh come on!

95
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,500
Cousin! My dear cousin,

96
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,659
you're finally here. It's urgent.

97
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:48,700
Saving a life is of boundless beneficence.

98
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,100
Our auditorium was suddenly renovated

99
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,740
and we borrowed your venue to perform.

100
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,580
But Xibai doesn't know

101
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,300
I was no longer the lead dancer now.

102
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,740
He is already on the way.

103
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,400
You have to help me to stop him.

104
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,940
Now you know that it's urgent.

105
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,380
I'll listen to your preach next time.

106
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,660
This show is our assignment.

107
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,720
It's very short, less than 5 minutes.

108
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,670
Although you don't treat me

109
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,740
like a younger sister,

110
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,900
you have to help me this time

111
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,460
so that I won't be ashamed.

112
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,220
Am I the type of person that takes advantage of you?

113
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,180
Of course not!

114
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,060
You're not afraid of danger. You're steady.

115
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,620
-You... -Stop saying like that.

116
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,880
I'm afraid Meng Xibai would send you to elementary school.

117
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,100
I'll rely on you.

118
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,020
Meng Xibai, I've been looking for you everywhere.

119
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,659
I have something to discuss with you.

120
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,090
Let's go to the lab to discuss it another day.

121
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,020
If someone cuts off the central nervous system,

122
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,350
can they still control their own muscles?

123
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,840
If a person loses the ability to control the nerves,

124
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:45,660
can other intelligent nerves be used instead?

125
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,140
It takes a long time

126
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,100
for me to explain it to you.

127
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,020
I'm really in a hurry.

128
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:51,940
Xinyu's show is about to start.

129
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,420
Don't you think this subject is interesting?

130
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,140
Then you can be excited alone for a while.

131
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,580
I really really need to go to the show now.

132
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,980
Is the show more important than the subject?

133
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,300
The show isn't important.

134
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,500
But Xinyu is more important than the subject.

135
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,260
Excuse me.

136
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,260
It is just an assignment?

137
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,620
Why are you dressed like that?

138
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,340
Suits, leather shoes and flowers.

139
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,000
Is it necessary to be so grand?

140
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,500
Ren Chu.

141
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,580
I have to argue with you

142
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,900
if you say that.

143
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,380
It is a must to be grand and pay enoug attention

145
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,140
Getting along with partners is to have a sense of ritual.

when she recalls this moment.

148

Many romantic moments can be ruined

149

if you don't pay attention to the details.

150
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,260

152
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,540
Talking about it actually works better than the subject.

00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,340
I'm sorry, Xinyu.

185
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,300
I met Ren Chu at the entrance.

186
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,700
So I was delayed for a bit.

187
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:38,900
When I came in,

188
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,470
your show has ended.

189
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,660
For you.

190
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,860
Although I didn't see your show with my own eyes,

191
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,320
I still congratulate you.

192
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,590
Then you have to make it up to me.

193
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:55,900
Come on.

194
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,260
Kiss me first.

195
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:07,340
Let's go out first. There are so many people here.

196
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,820
Let them be. It's not like I haven't kissed before.

197
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,100
My boyfriend is handsome.

198
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,100
They can only see but can't kiss you.

199
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,060
Come on.

200
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,300
Enough.

201
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,140
Some people are only active

202
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,580
when it comes to being in a relationship.

203
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,890
Unlike us,

204
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,260
we danced so hard.

205
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,780
You are right.

206
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,460
We cannot let them see

207
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,940
such a scene of an idol drama.

208
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,330
Let's go out to kiss.

209
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,740
Let's go.

210
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,600
Do you understand after watching it?

211
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,230
Doesn't it say we will understand after watching it?

212
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,380
Both of my eyes are normal,

213
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,340
yet I can't see any tricks with them.

214
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,140
It would be great if Xibai was here.

215
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,340
I could ask him

216
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,160
how he prepared for the competition before.

217
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,180
Why don't you ask Ren Chu?

218
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:05,940
He must know how.

219
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,260
No! I'm even trying to hide from him.

220
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,850
Wanwan, Gu Qiao, are you both free?

221
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,300
I helped our teacher to carry equipment

222
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,620
but I have to go out.

223
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,220
Can you help me carry them to the dormitory please?

224
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,060
No problem.

225
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,380
We're just going to get back.

226
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,380
Thank you. I need to get going first.

227
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,340
I need to go to the toilet.

228
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,670
Take care of them for me.

229
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:47,790
[A genius in studies.]

230
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,580
A genius in studies?

231
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,420
Ren Chu, I have something to ask you.

232
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,530
Wanwan, slow down.

233
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,140
I sprained my ankle.

234
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,790
You...sprain your ankle even wearing flats?

235
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,620
I sprained my ankle because of

236
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,260
my lack of strength in the lower limbs and feet,

237
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,550
not entirely because of the shoes.

238
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,630
Let's rest for a bit.

239
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,450
[MVP of a crush. It's accurate and inaccurate at the same time.]

240
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,740
The campus is so big,

241
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,380
but why do I meet him everywhere?

242
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,900
The...the campus is big,

243
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,460
but there's only one library.

244
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,790
It's normal to meet him.

245
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,540
The quality of the box is so good. There are even words on it.

246
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,850
[First aid kit.]

247
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,060
Oh my god.

248
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,980
You want me to make frame-by-frame animation for you?

249
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,780
That's right.

250
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,460
Wanwan really wanted your help,

251
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,100
so I sent you a message for her.

252
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,300
When did I say that?

253
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,020
Don't listen to what she says.

254
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,340
I've never made frame-by-frame animation before.

255
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,220
But I can make a small program for you.

256
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,340
No need. Frame-by-frame animation is required

257
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,540
in this competition.

258
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,620
No need to bother.

259
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,820
Wanwan has a frame-by-frame animation strategy tutorial.

260
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,980
It only takes 3 minutes.

261
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,040
Anyone with eyes will understand it.

262
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,220
How can Ren Chu be free to watch the tutorial?

263
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,220
Let's watch it.

264
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,220
Let's go!

265
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,420
Gu Qiao, you tricked me.

266
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,940
I'm just helping you to expand

267
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,820
the possibilities of your relationship.

268
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,620
And also, to meet the requirements of the competition.

269
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,950
This is called win-win.

270
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,820
She actually came to me for guidance.

271
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,700
It seems that I have become

272
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,060
a key step in her life proposition.

273
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:24,060
The tutorial is very clear. Let's get started.

274
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,100
That's amazing!

275
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,620
Ren Chu, what would you like to drink? I'll go buy it.

276
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,480
You two can take your time to chat.

277
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,640
Coffee, thank you.

278
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,660
Didn't she sprain her ankle?

279
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,120
Does Gu Qiao want to fall in love herself?

280
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:54,250
But instead, she's trying to be a matchmaker here!

281
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,580
Concentrate.

282
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,510
Oh right, this is how to make the frame-by-frame animation.

283
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,420
Come on, Lu Wanwan!

284
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,260
You can't fall again for a guy

285
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,980
who helps you with the study.

286
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,370
If it keeps happening,

287
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:35,030
why don't you just directly engage in a teacher-student romance?

I'll adjust.

He is so close to me.

297

Hold on, Lu Wanwan.

298
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,740
You could hold on when you drink too much.

Now, he's only helping you with your study.

300
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,050
You can only think about study!

I can never have a crush again,

Fan Yi would like?

348

He often reads magazines,

349

That's true.

00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,720
Have you finished eating?

368
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,260
Hurry up if so! We have things to do.

369
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,300
You...

370
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,140
If you mess around again,

371
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,900
I'll tell your parents that

372
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,580
you're in a relationship with fan Yi.

373
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,500
Don't talk nonsense.

374
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,370
Fan Yi and I aren't in a relationship... yet.

375
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,780
It's because you stole my phone

376
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,010
and texted Ren Chu.

377
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,740
You even left me alone with him in the library.

378
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,140
I wanted to help you.

379
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,460
Okay, fine.

380
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,060
I won't do it again next time.

381
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,740
But you're really not interested?

382
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,560
Ren Chu is great at studies and handsome.

383
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,060
He is your type.

384
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,260
You really don't feel your heart beating faster

385
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,330
when you're with him?

386
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,260
Carry this to the dormitory for me.

387
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,520
I have something to do.

388
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,260
Ren Chu,

389
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,020
there's something I want you to cooperate with.

390
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,010
What is it?

391
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,580
Do a medical checkup.

392
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,160
Can you hold my hand?

393
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,260
I want to confirm something.

394
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,560
Please help me with it.

395
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,060
Hold hands?

396
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,580
Is she going to

397
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,780
profess her love to me?

398
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,620
It takes fewer steps than I imagined to solve the problem.

399
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,340
But

400
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,460
I'm ready to know the answer.

401
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,660
Alright.

402
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:04,330
The normal heartbeat of an adult

403
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,100
is 70 to 80 beats per minute.

404
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,420
When the heart rate of an adult

405
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,420
reaches 100 to 160 beats per minute,

406
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,780
it's called sinus tachycardia.

407
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:17,860
This phenomenon is common after exercising, drinking alcohol, and drinking strong tea.

408
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,540
Or

409
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,340
uncontrollable excitement and throbbing

410
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,300
due to someone or something.

411
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,100
The brain can lie to me,

412
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,580
but the stethoscope can't.

413
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,700
Whether I like him or not,

414
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,020
I'll diagnose it myself.

415
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:34,460
Three Two One.

416
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,900
What am I doing?

417
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,980
So what if I really like him?

418
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,660
Another five years of secret crush?

419
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,900
I couldn't even get an elementary genius like An Jiaxian.

420
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,260
Why do I have to hurt myself with this?

421
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,420
Wanwan, are you that strong?

422
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:03,100
I suddenly remembered that there's something wrong with this stethoscope.

423
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,300
Forget about it.

424
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,620
Thank you, Ren Chu.

425
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,530
Goodbye.

426
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,180
Wanwan.

427
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:32,170
Wanwan, what were you doing

428
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:33,370
with Ren Chu just now?

429
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:38,140
Nothing, just adjusting the equipment.

430
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,140
Wanwan, I've been busy recently

431
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,780
on the debate circuit.

432
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,140
I haven't been around on the campus.

433
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,270
I didn't have time to catch up with you.

434
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,700
Are you mad at me?

435
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,260
No.

436
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,680
I'm afraid you'd be mad at me

437
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,540
for the skull cake.

438
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,090
No.

439
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,060
You didn't mean to scare me.

440
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,370
Besides,

441
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:06,340
we are good friends, aren't we?

442
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,700
By the way, Wanwan, I want to learn how to make desserts recently.

443
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,770
Can we make them together?

444
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:14,780
Sure.

445
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,250
Great.

446
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,780
Then I'll come to you at the Baking Club later.

447
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,790
Wanwan, it is interesting to make desserts.

448
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,850
Please teach me more.

449
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,000
But

450
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,690
are there many members in the Baking Club?

451
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:42,500
Would you be too busy?

452
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,810
There's just me in the bakery club.

453
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,990
Then, can I be the first member in your Baking Club?

454
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,100
Of course!

455
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,010
But why do you want to join the Baking Club?

456
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,480
I saw Fan Yi doing

457
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,000
a lucky draw

458
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,720
in the morning.

459
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,780
I find that interesting.

460
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,670
I just thought that I would participate more

461
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,870
in different clubs to experience more.

462
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,950
By the way, did you

463
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:13,950
do the lucky draw?

464
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,490
I got a cupid knocking on the door and shooting some arrows.

465
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:18,700
It's quite cute.

466
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,550
Not sure who drew it.

467
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,580
You also got that one?

468
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,350
Who else got that one too?

469
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,830
That should be quite accurate.

470
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:33,490
You're so beautiful, so there must be a lot of people that like you.

471
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:36,970
Actually I don't really want so many people to like me.

472
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:41,000
I only hope that the person I like will like me.

473
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,400
But it is a pity.

474
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,220
Wanwan,

475
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:50,450
can I trust you?

476
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,630
Of course! You are my first member of the club.

477
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,000
Then, let me tell you a secret.

478
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,800
I actually have someone I like.

479
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,570
He is...

480
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,140
Ren Chu.

481
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,510
I only tell it to you.

482
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:15,020
Please don't tell anyone.

483
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:21,620
Campus queen and king match well.

484
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:27,370
Even though he is popular on campus,

485
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:29,810
he is actually very low-key.

486
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,210
He doesn't like being paid attention to by others.

487
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,570
The most high-profile thing

488
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:39,170
he has ever done

489
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:40,680
should be watching me in debate competitions

490
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,810
even though there were so many people.

491
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,930
I'm quite touched.

492
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,170
Wanwan.

493
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:02,060
I've waited for you in the dormitory room for a long time,

494
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,460
but I didn't see you back.

495
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:05,340
It turns out that you're hiding here eating dessert.

496
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,200
Is there any more? Can I have some?

497
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:11,930
Do you think

498
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:16,850
it was difficult for Liang Xia at that time?

499
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,800
One is her friend,

500
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:25,630
and the other is the person she likes.

501
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:29,050
It doesn't seem right to choose either side.

502
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,760
If it was you, how would you choose?

503
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:35,660
I definitely won't steal someone my friend likes.

504
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,160
No.

505
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:37,680
I won't have any interest at all

506
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,150
in people that my friends like.

507
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,290
The world is big.

508
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:43,420
Why do I have to fight against a friend?

509
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,240
Why are you suddenly

510
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,970
thinking about the past again?

511
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:50,400
Let's go over the manuscript again.

512
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:01,240
How was it? Have you got Lu Wanwan done?

513
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,100
That's for sure.

514
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,630
People who haven't been in a relationship like Lu Wanwan

515
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:10,690
would blush even when holding hands.

516
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:12,200
She would surely panic

517
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:14,050
when I took the oath of sovereignty.

518
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:14,930
That's true.

519
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,380
There is no other choice.

520
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:22,200
There are too few good guys now.

521
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,530
I have to take the initiative when I've got my eye on someone.

522
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:28,450
By the way, how's it going on your end?

523
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:33,370
I got Ren Chu's phone number

524
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:34,290
and WeChat ID.

525
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:35,910
I'll send them to you.

526
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:39,200
Check them out.

527
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,930
[Ren Chu]

528
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,420
If I had taken the initiative earlier

529
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,810
and hadn't been so reserved,

530
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:49,540
Lu Wanwan would have nothing to do with him at all.

531
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,190
Fortunately, it's still not too late.

532
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,200
Ren Chu,

533
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:08,720
I am Guan Ai from the Department of Chinese Language.

534
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,570
Lu Wanwan gave me

535
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,220
your phone number.

536
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,170
Some people are only active

537
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,010
when being in a relationship.

538
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,830
Unlike us, we dance very hard.

539
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,900
Sharp eyes.

540
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,380
My titanium alloy dog eyes are not trained for nothing.

541
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,080
Wanwan,

542
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,980
it must be yesterday's juice that causes the diarrhoea.

543
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,830
I even borrowed a suit,

544
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,600
just to make a great success when giving a speech.

545
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,190
Now nothing is going with the plan.

546
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,650
Do you want some medicine?

547
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,970
it won't get better in just a while.

548
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,410
I'm really sorry about this.

549
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:57,090
There must be something wrong with the lucky draw.

550
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:59,090
