00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,590
So there are so many

00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,789
twists and turns in Fire Dragon Valley.

If you weren't bringing us around,

7
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:59,250
anyone who comes from outside would be lost.

00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,360

9
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:06,840
Please.

10
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,420
Yan Rushan.

11
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,470
You deceived so many people.

12
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,760
You will be punished sooner or later.

13
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,160
Thanks for the reminder.

14
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,590
Unfortunately,

15
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,210
there isn't anyone

18
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,640
How dare you play tricks in front of me?

19
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,950
You’ve been looking around.

20
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,610
You're trying to work out the valley's terrain, right?

21
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,000
So what if you make it out?

22
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,680
You can only stay here now.

23
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,910
I really want to join you.

24
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,630
I don't care if you're sincere or not.

25
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,920
What you need to do now

26
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,010
is to think about how to deal with this bitch.

27
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,070
This is the barrier I set with the power of the Fire Dragon Force.

28
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,680
I advise you not to waste your energy.

29
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,680
You can't escape.

Chieftain Chi.

31
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,220
Why choose somewhere this gloomy

32
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,820
when you're giving me a gift.

33
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,660
I never owe anyone anything.

34
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,200
Since you

35
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,670
saved us from the Huntian Prison,

36
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,780
these two people:

37
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,630
one is a constable from Yiqi Alliance,

38
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,440
and the other is Tushan Rongrong's disciple,

39
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,040
consider them my repayment.

40
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,240
When Tushan Honghong comes,

41
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,520
you can use them as hostages.

42
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,150
Looks like

43
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,079
you're rejecting me.

44
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,090
Goodbye.

45
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,200
If you look at me like this,

46
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,940
I'm a little scared.

47
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,070
You're a man of Thousand-Faces,

48
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,130
aren't you good at deceiving people?

49
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,830
Now that you have been deceived,

50
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,760
how does it feel?

51
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,010
I told you I was careless.

52
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,720
When I get out,

53
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,090
I will get back at what happened today.

54
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,330
Do you think you still have a chance?

55
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,290
Wh-What are you doing?

56
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,730
How did you flirt with those girls?

57
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,600
What are you talking about?

58
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,800
I'm interrogating you. Can't you tell?

59
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:44,990
Speak.

60
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,600
Well...

61
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,430
How do I say it?

62
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,450
Be honest.

63
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,450
How did you make those girls fall in love with you?

64
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,080
Do I really have to say it?

65
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,150
What do you think?

66
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,120
Actually,

67
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,450
I've never flirted with them.

68
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,400
When those girls see me,

69
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,870
they always take the initiative.

70
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,750
Shameless!

71
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,000
Woman abductor Yan Rushan

72
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,710
is cunning and eloquent.

73
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,960
He's good at deceiving women with his beauty.

74
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,560
Let me correct it.

75
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,070
It's "He's good at deceiving women

76
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,510
who are pretty and gentle with his beauty."

77
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,950
I'm not interested in women like you

78

What are you going to do?

82
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,270
Let me show you

83
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,310
what it means to be not ladylike.

84
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,240
Help!

85
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,680

Why are you looking for me?

88
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,090
am here to inform you of something.

89
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,570

What trouble?

95
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,290
Tushan Honghong has found out

96
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,070
they are hiding in the Huolong Valley.

97
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,600
They may attack at any time.

98
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
Chieftain Chi Lei

99
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,600
wants to send someone to hurt Tushan Honghong first.

100
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,070
He also said that no matter who it is,

101
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,390
as long as they can accomplish this mission,

102
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:40,070
they can be the Deputy Chief of the Chi Sha Bandits.

103
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,780
But after the order was issued,

104
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,190
no one dared to go.

105
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,000
Did my brother really say

106
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,830
whoever hurt Tushan Honghong

107
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,159
can be the deputy chief?

108
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:04,750
Doctor,

109
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,390
do you have weeping fern?

110
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:08,900
Weeping fern?

111
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,630
Hold on.

You're courting death.

How dare you make trouble here?

119
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,530
Exactly.

120
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,560
How dare you provoke our chief in public!

121
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,920
Are you looking for death?

122

Just wait for your death.

131

Tushan Honghong, let me ask you.

132
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,270
Why are you always picking a fight with my brother?

133
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,430
Did he offend you?

134
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,760
Why are you pushing him?

135
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:03,950
Chi Shan.

136
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:07,120
The Chi Sha Bandits have been violent for years.

They have killed countless innocent people.

138
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:12,070
This time, he colluded with the evil spirits to escape.

139
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,360
Capturing him is the responsibility of the Spirit Alliance.

140
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,100
My brother is an evil spirit.

141
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,000
Evil spirits have to do evil things.

142
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,800
Only good spirits like you can live in this world?

143
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
You won't let the evil spirits live?

144
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,600
Chi Shan.

145
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,230
You've come to Tushan to cause trouble time after time.

146
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,800
Considering your innocent nature,

147
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,580
and that you've never made any big mistake,

148
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,580
I won't hold you to account for this.

149
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,600
Why are you holding this pole?

150
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,580
Are you trying to scare me?

151
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,090
Get lost!

152
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:47,600
Move!

153
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,260
Step aside!

154
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,000
Tushan Honghong...

155
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,270

156
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,790

Where is it?

161

Let's go and have a look.

162
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,630
Why are you here?

163
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,290
I went to the pharmacy to get medicine.

164
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,330
Look at Chi Shan.

165
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,700
It looks like the Claw of Insulation.

Look at you.

You're determined,

Don't think about so many unhappy things.

175
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,580
Have some watermelon.

176
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,900
What's wrong?

177
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,870
When you were in a bad mood,

178
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,290
you always wanted to eat watermelon, no?

179
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,330
I don't understand

180
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,230
why Honghong looks like she's a whole different person.

181
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,450
In my opinion,

182
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,450
you have to think of it this way:

183
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,420
when you went down the mountain,

184
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,180
you never thought

185
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,020
you'd see Honghong again.

186
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,560
But you reunited with her so soon.

187
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,230
You should be happy.

188
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,940
I'm not happy at all.

189
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,090
Do you regret leaving Tushan?

190
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,440
There has to be someone who takes this step

191
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,790
for the harmony between humans and spirits.

192
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,600
Yes.

193
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,020
Look.

194
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,270
In the past three years,

195
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,720
you've cultivated countless magic tools for humans.

196
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,370
Besides,

197
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,220
you've resolved many conflicts between humans and spirits.

198
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,740
They all remember it.

199
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,780
Besides,

200
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,340
even in Yiqi Alliance,

201
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,580
your words and actions are getting of more value.

202
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,800
Thank you for your concern.

203
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,630
You're the only one who cares about me.

204
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,840
Brat!

205
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,090
Isn't it enough that I care about you?

206
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,080
If Lai knows about this,

207
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,590
he'll be jealous.

208
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,200
You're smiling?

209
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,570
That's good.

210
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,530
Have some watermelon.

211
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,770
Do you want some?

212
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,270
No, I brought it for you.

213
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,260
Oh no.

214
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,320
Someone imitated Honghong

215
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,340
and killed Chi Shan with

216
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,670
the Claw of Insulation.

217
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,350
Shi Ji is still sealed in there.

218
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:51,690
Who was the one who imitated the Claw of Insulation?

219
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,380
No matter what,

220
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,950
we can't delay the capture of the spirits in Huolong Valley.

221
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:00,750
Don't let it affect the creation of your antidote.

222
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,050
Other than you,

223
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:15,240
only Shi Ji knows how to imitate the Claw of Insulation.

224
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,030
Who else would frame you?

225
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,630
This person must know Tushan very well.

226
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,030
It seems that in Tushan,

227
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,810
except the White-Eyed Fox,

228
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,230
there's another spy.

229
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,230
Chief.

230
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:30,910
Yaya.

231
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,290
Why did you bring him here?

232
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,550
I couldn't stop him.

233
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,360
I told you

234
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,360
you can't trap me.

235
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,550
When did you escape?

236
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,010
Are you suspecting that I killed Chi Shan now?

237
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,590
How did you know that Chi Shan was killed?

238
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,920
I can testify.

239
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,200
He has been in the prison.

240
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,460
He didn't go anywhere.

241
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,270
As for why he knew,

242
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,760
I told him.

243
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,970
Why did you go to jail?

244
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:57,570
I...

245
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,130
Enough.

246
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,530
I'll clarify one last time.

247
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,220
I'm not a spy.

248
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,810
The real spy

249
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,690
is the person who hid in the dark to kill Chi Shan.

250
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,960
The spiritual butterfly that night

251
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,320
has something to do with him too.

252
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,760
This is just your guess.

253
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,270
Isn't your suspicion just a guess too?

254
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:18,930
You guys talk.

255
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,750
Well,

256
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,150
Yaya and I will check

257
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,350
if there are any other clues on Chi Shan.

258
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:24,800
Let's go.

259
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:26,670
Let's go.

260
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,090
What will you do?

261
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,790
This has proven that I’m not a spy.

262
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,200
Chief.

263
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,330
Instead of focusing on suspecting me,

264
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,950
why don't you work with me

265
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,550
to catch the evil spirits

266
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,850
and find out the conspiracy behind it.

267
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,790
What if I don't agree?

268
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,180
Then I can only get Nangong Shi to come work with you.

269
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,580
Are you threatening me?

270
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,810
You can think of it that way.

271
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,200
Fine.

272
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,250
I agree to releasing you.

273
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,220
But you have to promise

274
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,490
that you won't follow me anymore.

275
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,400
And during the period of our cooperation,

276
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,390
do as I say.

277
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,390
Deal.

278
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,270
It's all your fault.

279
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,740
You can't even keep an eye on a human brat.

280
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,550
I can stop him.

281
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,750
But I can’t just watch

282
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,480
Chief making mistakes one after another.

283
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,960
And the situation right now is dangerous and complicated.

284
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,280
Only by cooperating with Yuechu

285
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,340
would it be the best choice for Chief.

286
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,410
What do you mean?

287
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,140
Besides Yuechu,

288
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,220
can you find anyone else who'd risk their life

289
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,560
to protect Chief?

290
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,100
I really feel sorry for him.

291
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,440
Your sister

292
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,630
won't understand his feelings.

293
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,390
But compared to Yuechu,

294
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,120
I feel more sorry for Honghong.

295
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,810
At least Yuechu

296
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,270
still has love and can love.

297
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,580
But Honghong can't love anymore.

298
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:08,710
Deputy Chief!

299
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,540
Deputy Chief.

300
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,070
Chi Shan's body is missing.

301
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:18,550
Brother.

302
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,820
If we just run away,

303
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,510
when the news gets out,

304
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,670
and those evil spirits find out,

305
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,870
they will laugh at us.

306
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,670
Tushan Honghong will come sooner or later.

307
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,320
We'll die if we don't leave.

308
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,630
What's wrong?

309
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,120
Chi Shan!

310
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,140
Who would steal Chi Shan's corpse?

311
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,950
That's not the point.

312
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:01,490
The point is, what's the use of stealing his corpse?

313
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,160
That's right.

314
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,880
Someone wants to use Chi Lei against me

315
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,530
to deal with Tushan.

316
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,240
They made a mistake then.

317
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,540
The Chi Sha Bandits are powerful,

318
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,300
but they're not as good as you.

319
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,349
You're right.

320
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:18,839
Chi Lei can't defeat Honghong.

321
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,400
It's not necessary for him to confront Tushan.

322
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,750
But with Chi Shan's death,

323
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,750
it'd force Chi Lei

324
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:26,010
to become enemies with Honghong.

325
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,730
You can't go to Huolong Valley.

326
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,060
There must be a trap.

327
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,790
Now that you put it this way,

328
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:36,120
I really want to meet the person behind it.

329
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,570
Don't be impulsive.

330
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,540
The antidote is not ready yet.

331
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,440
Why don't you wait a little longer?

332
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,110
Everyone,

333
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,940
the antidote for the miasma is ready.

334
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,510
Is there anything wrong?

335
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,480
Your antidote

336
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,250
came just in time.

337
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,570
Chi Shan's body was stolen.

338
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,130
You're a constable.

339
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:05,800
Tell me.

340
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,010
How did my brother die?

341
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,620
Did you find anything?

342
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:20,750
Speak!

343
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,360
This wound

344
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,300
should be caused by the Claw of Insulation.

345
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,810
The Claw of Insulation?

346
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,110
In the six realms,

347
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,240
only Tushan Honghong knows

348
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,140
the Claw of Insulation.

349
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,270
She'd better take responsibility.

350
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,680
It's not a problem if she kills me.

351
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,480
But why does she

352
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:52,090
have to get my brother involved?

353
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,720
I'll kill you and Yan Rushan!

354
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,810
Then Tushan!

355
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,640
Wait.

356
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,070
I've lived in Tushan.

357
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,830
Given Chi Shan's level,

358
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,370
there's no need for Chief to take action personally.

359
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,330
I forgot.

360
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,000
You're the disciple of Tushan Rongrong.

361
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,420
You only dare

362
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:25,260
to show off in Huolong Valley.

363
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,550
If you dare to,

364
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,420
go look for Tushan's chief

365
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,610
and ask her face to face.

366
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,520
Yan Rushan, stop it.

367
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,180
Chi Lei!

368
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,220
Do you have the ability

369
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,720
to kill Chief?

370
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,200
Don't worry.

371
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,200
I'll kill you first.

372
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,030
I'll go look for Tushan Honghong after.

373
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,220
Chi Lei!

374
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,640
Stop!

375
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,970
Didn't you escape overnight?

376
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,260
Why are you back?

377
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,920
Are you sure

378
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,970
you can kill Tushan Honghong?

379
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,130
It's boring to just kill her alone.

380
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,570
What do you mean?

381
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,900
Huolong Valley's terrain

382
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,700
is different from other vallys.

383
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,040
As long as we can lure Tushan Honghong over,

384
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,230
I'll make her die here.

385
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,910
Why did you deliberately provoke Chi Lei just now?

386
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,330
What do you mean deliberately?

387
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,710
I don't know what you're talking about.

388
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,110
Do you think I can't tell?

389
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,790
You were deliberately

390
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:01,990
making Chi Lei angry.

391
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,960
Otherwise, given someone like you

392
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,290
who likes to play tricks

393
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,490
and lie,

394
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,140
Chi Lei wouldn't get angry at you.

395
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,440
His brother died.

396
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,790
He has to vent his anger on someone.

397
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,740
I'm tough.

398
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,200
It's nothing for me to

399
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,130
take a few blows.

400
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,650
Thank you.

401
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,270
What?

402
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,090
Nothing.

403
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,920
I don't think you're an evil person.

404
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,430
Why did you hurt those girls?

405
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,400
Believe it or not,

406
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,640
I really didn't kill those girls.

407
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,790
I also want to find out

408
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,190
who framed me.

409
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,750
Even if you didn't kill them,

410
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,550
you did deceive their feelings.

411
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,620
Yes, I'm a bad person.

412
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,550
But they are also greedy for beauty.

413
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,640
If I look

414
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,570
extremely ugly,

415
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,830
do you think they will fall for my trap

416
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:06,880
and listen to me?

417
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,440
That's just an excuse.

418
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,160
No matter what,

419
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,890
I will still have to arrest you.

420
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,160
We were all willing parties

421
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,350
and getting what we need.

422
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:13,620
You...

423
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,680
Thank you for your concern.

424
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,270
But

425
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,540
you shouldn't worry about me,

426
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,440
the woman abductor.

427
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,080
Do you want to hear a story?

428
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:56,910
What story?

429
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,470
It's about a little girl.

430
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,480
Once upon a time in a village,

431
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,320
there was a little girl.

432
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,960
Hey, ugly. You're so ugly.

433
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,960
Are you out doing groceries?

434
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,220
You're so ugly. You should live in a cave.

Where are you going?

438
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,030
Go!

439
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,480
Take off her mask!

440
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,200
Take it off!

We should just kill them.

It's a waste of food keeping them in here,

we have to make sure they don't escape too.

let me do this in the future.

501
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,730
Does it hurt?

502
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:15,450
Yes.

503
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,370

Sister.

506

Chi Lei put out the news about

507
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,850
Yan Rushan and Lyu Jianwen being captured

508
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:37,000
means he must've set up an ambush

509
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,110
in Huolong Valley.

510
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,590
You'd better let Lai go with you.

511
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,400
No need.

512
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,010
You two stay in Tushan.

513
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,110
Be careful.

514
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,750
Even so,

515
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,350
we aren't informed of the terrain

516
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,790
of Huolong Valley beforehand.

517
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,350
There are also evil spirits ambushing.

518
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:52,920
If...

519
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,590
Lai can go,

520
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:55,890
it'd be great.

521
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,960
If you're afraid,

522
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,560
why don't you stay in Tushan?

523
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,700
The antidote is ready anyway,

524
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,390
right?

525
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,280
You'll be a burden if you go.

526
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,240
Why are you staring at me?

527
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,590
I'm just being honest.

528
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:13,380
Stop looking.

529
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,900
I'm shy.

530
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,570
If he doesn’t go,

531
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,710
and something changes in the poisonous miasma in the valley,

532
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,310
you're going to deal with it?

533
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,760
I...

534
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,520
It's getting late.

535
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,030
Let's get going.

536
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,640
Don't you think Honghong

537
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,240
was being too harsh just now?

538
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,860
That brat looks so defeated.

539
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,370
Don't worry.

540
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,160
He won't be.

541
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,010
The more she does this,

542
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,080
the stronger he will become.

543
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,680
No!

544
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,400
No!

545
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,350
Yan Rushan

546
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,150
normally goes for pretty girls.

547
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,740
He's not being picky anymore?

548
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,300
Let go!

549
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,660
He must be hungry.

550
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,680
Let go!

551
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,300
Xue Zang!

552
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,670
You bastard!

553
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,140
Ye Mei!

554
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,750
You said you would love me forever

555
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,160
when we were in Huntian Prison!

556
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,350
We just escaped.

557
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,740
Yet you're already doing this with someone else behind my back!

558
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,270
On top of that, it's someone like Lyu Jianwen?

559
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,400
How dare you slander me in front of me?

560
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:41,680
Xue Zang's standards are pretty questionable.

561
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,640
He took a liking to you?

562
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,070
You...

563
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,790
Look carefully.

564
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,200
It's me.

565
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,490
The man of Thousand-Faces.

566
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:52,170
Tushan Honghong has set off.

567
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:55,440
After Tushan Honghong attacks the valley,

568
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,920
just follow the plan.

569
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,680
If we cooperate,

570
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:02,620
we can definitely help you avenge your brother's death.

571
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,000
Brother!

572
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,000
Bad news.

573
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,080
What's wrong?

574
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:06,640
Ye Mei...

575
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,240
Ye Mei has gone missing!

576
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,270
She's gone missing?

577
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:12,330
Didn't I ask her to keep an eye on those two in the prison?

578
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:16,590
Where are Yan Rushan and Lyu Jianwen?

579
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,720
They're gone too.

580
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,720
That fool!

581
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,490
What should we do, brother?

582
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:22,960
Yan Rushan and Lyu Jianwen

583
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,760
ran away holding Ye Mei hostage.

584
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,640
Take some men

585
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,610
to get them back before Tushan Honghong

586
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:29,580
enters the valley.

587
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,840
With them on our hands,

588
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,290
we won't be afraid of Tushan Honghong.

589
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,270
Okay!

590
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,580
Over there too.

591
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,620
There's a trap over there.

592
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,480
What is that?

593
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,060
A secret passage?

594
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:53,080
What a joke.

595
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,030
If you can see it so easily,

596
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,150
it wouldn't be a secret passage.

597
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,270
Miss Ye.

598
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,800
You seem to look down upon my intelligence.

599
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,030
You make a fair point.

600
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,590
What I like to do

601
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,400
is to pick women up.

602
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,490
What are you doing?

603
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,800
Cooperate with Constable Lyu.

604
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,140
Otherwise, I won't hold back.

605
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,590
It's... It's a bridge to leave the valley.

606
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,070
That's right.

607
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,640
When we entered the valley just now,

608
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,770
we took this bridge.

609
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:32,610
What else?

610
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:35,920
Go on.

611
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:38,480
The back of Huolong Valley is a cliff,

612
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,680
and it faces an abyss.

613
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,010
It's surrounded by poisonous miasma.

614
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,490
We can only enter and leave

615
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,120
through this bridge.

616
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:49,930
Constable Lyu.

617
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,140
This person is cunning and sly.

618
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,340
Be careful.

619
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,360
What are you going to do?

620
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,960
It’s not my style to surrender.

621
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:04,850
Constable Lyu.

622
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,030
Miss Lyu.

623
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,060
It was nice working with you.

624
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:07,950
See you!

625
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,880
Yan Rushan,

626
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:14,880
I will catch you!

627
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,390
Don't you human race have a saying?

628
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,320
That everything a man says is a lie.

629
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,730
What a sentimental woman abductor.

630
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,350
Why didn't you bring your new lover

631
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,500
when you are on the run?

632
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,300
Take the antidote pill first.

633
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,920
The situation in Huolong Valley is unpredictable.

634
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,170
Do as I say when we go in.

635
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:54,830
Yes.

636
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,280
Don't worry.

637
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:58,020
I will follow you closely

638
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,240
and never leave you.

639
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:00,680
I will follow you.

640
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:02,920
It’s none of your business.

641
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,300
I'm following Chief

642
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,200
to protect her.

643
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:07,180
-If you follow her–
-Mr. Dongfang.

644
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:08,720
Take care of yourself.

645
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:10,990
Stay by my side.

646
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,270
I'll protect you.

647
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,460
Yuechu.

648
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,610
Tushan's Chief

649
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,110
seems to dislike you a lot.

650
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,820
How smart of you.

651
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:31,800
Of course.

652
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,790
Listen carefully.

653
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,480
Watch Dongfang Luo.

654
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:37,240
Don't let anyone hurt him.

655
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,500
If not he'd be a burden to Tushan's Chief.

656
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:39,980
Yes!

657
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:52,340
Aren't you Chi Sha Bandits infamous?

658
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,920
With such low skill level,

659
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,740
you're trying to challenge my chief?

660
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,820
I was careless

661
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,000
so I fell into your trap.

662
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,160
Let's fight again?

663
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,620
Again?

664
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,310
You wish.

665
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Yan Rushan.

666
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,920
Where do you want to go?

667
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,920
You said

668
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,920
We Chi Sha Bandits don't live up to our name.

669
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,550
So what if I did?

670
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,330
I'll show you

671
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:30,240
what the true power of the Chi Sha Bandits is like.

672
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,850
Tears of the Sea!

673
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:47,420
I don't need to fight you head-on.

674
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,150
The light of the full moon is enough.

675
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:57,050
You're starting to lose your spirit power, right?

676
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:57,960
No!

677
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,430
No!

678
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,510
No!

679
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:01,200
No...

680
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,400
No!

681
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,880
Yan Rushan,

682
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,050
I'll kill you today.

683
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,150
What are you waiting for?

684
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,310
Leave now!

685
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,690
What are you doing?

686
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:14,790
Go!

687
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,480
You're no match for Fire Dragon!

688
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,320
Don't worry. As long as I can block the moonlight with this,

689
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,030
I can deal with Chi Lei!

690
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:22,850
Go!

691
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:42,610
Show your true form!

692
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,290
If...

693
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,190
If I can't go back alive this time,

694
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,020
promise me

695
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:29,220
to turn yourself in.

696
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:38,960
Lyu Jianwen.

697
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,000
What are you doing?

698
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,440
You can't defeat him!

699
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:43,640
Lyu Jianwen!

700
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,430
Lyu Jianwen!

701
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:46,610
You'll die.

702
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,760
Lyu Jianwen!

703
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:04,880
It's my turn.

704
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:09,940
Come on.

705
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,190
Red-bearded Fire Dragon
