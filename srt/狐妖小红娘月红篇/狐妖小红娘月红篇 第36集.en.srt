Sacrificial Formation.

00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,960
Tushan Honghong.

6
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,680
If I were you, I would just give up.

7
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,870
The love you believe in doesn't exist anymore,

8
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,680
does it?

9
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,750
Dongfang Yuechu

10
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,840
is on his way here...

11
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,360
To kill you!

12
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,770
They're coming.

13
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,910
These are not normal humans!

14
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,650
What should we do?

15
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,680
Well...

16
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,390
When do we attack?

17
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,680
We've been waiting for so long.

18
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,750
When can we attack?

19
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,970
No one is allowed to act rashly.

20
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,420
Act according to the Director's signal.

21
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,080
Sacrificial Formation.

22
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,280
Why is this formation so resistant to my approach?

23
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:57,830
Shi Ji.

24
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,690
For your own ambition,

25
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,160
you tore apart humans and spirits

26
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,360
and created tension.

27
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:05,960
You even caused chaos in the six realms with external power.

28
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,220
Many people's happiness has been ruined by you.

29
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,390
Many innocent children lost their parents because of you.

30
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,120
Many beautiful and peaceful places

31
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,650
are in chaos because of you.

32
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,000
Everything you did,

33
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,000
I will end them

34
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,270
today.

35
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,080
You drew thunder with hatred to kill Weisheng.

36
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:40,430
Today, I will let you experience the same pain!

37
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,800
I'll let the Black Foxes you lured over

38
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,360
to kill you off.

39
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,270
Have you forgotten that I have hatred too?

40
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,510
All my hatred will be passed on to you.

41
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,510
Tushan Honghong.

42
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,800
When you are completely swallowed by hatred,

43
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,270
at that time,

44
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,070
I will destroy the six realms you protect myself.

45
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,510
Come and die with me!

46
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,630
This is...

47
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,190
hatred.

48
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,800
In this world,

49
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,220
there are so many evil people doing evil things,

50
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,680
and so many bad things happen every day.

51
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,480
Diseases.

52
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,800
Disasters.

53
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,120
Deaths.

54
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,040
Humans and spirits hate each other.

55
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,600
Love...

56
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,600
will always be destroyed by hatred.

57
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,840
The six realms are doomed to be destroyed.

58
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,600
Your protection

59
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,680
is meaningless.

60
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,150
In this world,

61
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,680
there are many innocent and kind people.

62
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,240
They work hard and love peace.

63
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,430
As long as they are around,

64
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,360
there will be endless love

65
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,420
and the six realms will be protected.

66
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,120
It's useless to talk more.

67
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,310
You still won't come to your senses!

68
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,190
Tushan Honghong.

69
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,240
You are too naive!

70
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,270
Heaven & Earth Thread...

71
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,860
When you took back Heaven & Earth Thread,

72
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,550
it was for this?

73
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,910
To fuse my blood into Love Seed

74
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,270
and have Grief Tree recognize me...

75
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,720
Even if you forget me,

76
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,510
no one can sacrifice me.

77
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,550
Yuechu!

78
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,770
Yuechu...

79
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,910
As long as I kill you,

80
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,890
the Black Foxes can enter the six realms.

81
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,450
You care so much about the six realms.

82
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,740
Why can't you bear to part with Dongfang Yuechu?

83
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,860
As long as he coagulates the Tear of Void,

84
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,750
he can give the Black Foxes a form

85
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,270
and stop them from entering other dimensions.

86
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,480
You...

87
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,390
still have a chance to turn the tide.

88
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,450
I've been consumed by hatred.

89
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,150
Only by coagulating Tear of Void

90
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,870
can I release my hatred

91
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,750
and be saved.

92
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,180
I will protect both the six realms

93
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,480
and him!

94
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,850
I don't understand.

95
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,080
Why you are still struggling?

96
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,870
When you're about to die,

97
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,390
can love save you?

98
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,370
What's going on?

99
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,430
There seems to be hatred within them.

100
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,660
This hatred is stronger than before.

101
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,940
To be able to make them into an existence that can't be killed

102
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,800
is beyond Shi Ji's capabilities.

103
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,750
Director has given a command.

104
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,120
When the Black Foxes show up,

105
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,600
we'll join forces with the Spirit Alliance

106
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,320
to kill the external Black Foxes who have been killing humans and spirits.

107
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,850
They are the origin of the six realms dispute.

108
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,580
Spirit Alliance, listen.

109
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,870
Humans and spirits are equal.

110
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,690
We fight for the six realms together!

111
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,720
We fight for the six realms!

112
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,280
Tear of Void...

113
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,560
You're fine now.

114
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,150
Why are you so silly?

115
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,080
I didn't tell you

116
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,270
because I don't want you to waste your vitality on me

117
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,930
to coagulate the Tear of Void.

118
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,730
I've already thought about using this

119
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,100
to give the Black Foxes a form.

120
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,220
Peace between humans and spirits

121
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,600
is not only your belief,

122
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,490
but it has also long become

123
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,440
mine.

124
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,150
But I want you to live.

125
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,080
I know.

126
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,250
I understand everything.

127
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,320
When we first met,

128
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,250
it's as if my world changed.

129
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,120
But this time,

130
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,930
you don't have to protect me anymore.

131
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,510
This time,

132
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,390
let's protect

133
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,640
the future of the six realms together.

134
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,360
With my blood,

135
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,000
I will burn your bones

136
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,240
with no fear of death.

137
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,150
This is the last thing

00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,150

♫It fills the gaps of life♫

so that she's never in grief.

♫To return to your embrace♫

214
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:10,550
Originally, I wanted to use Tear of Void to control spacetime

215
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,630
and let us enter and leave the circle as we wish.

216
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:17,310
But you used it to force us to show our form.

217
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:21,750
But it's not up to you

218
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,240
who the Tear of Void will be used by!

219
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:26,750
We don't know

220
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,270
who wins or loses yet!

221
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,120
The queen of fox spirits,

222
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,480
Tushan Honghong,

223
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,400
you are rapidly losing your spirit power.

224
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,880
Meanwhile, my body

225
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,350
can recover quickly.

226
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:56,240
It's really easy to kill you now.

227
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,240
If you die,

228
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,440
Dongfang Yuechu can never revive.

229
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,240
You are destined to die in my hands!

230
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,750
You planned everything

231
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,240
for us to kill each other.

232
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,440
But what you don't know is, a complete Tear of Void

233
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,720
needs true love.

234
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,440
Yuechu...

235
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,360
With my spirit power,

236
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,420
and your spiritual blood,

237
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,480
let's protect our future together.

238
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,310
The Black Fox has left the body.

239
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,640
Don't think you can run!

240
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,240
You...

241
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,270
Fool.

242
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,240
I'm not a fool.

243
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,440
I fell in love

244
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,880
with the best spirit

245
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,400
in this world.

246
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,170
That's all I want

247
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,830
in this life.

248
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,350
You did everything this life

249
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,550
for me.

250
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,920
For me,

251
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,070
you left Tushan.

252
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:38,880
For me,

253
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,960
you rose the ranks.

254
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,030
For me,

255
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,280
you did everything to stop the fight between humans and spirits.

256
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,400
Just for me...

257
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:59,240
someone who always prioritizes the six realms over you.

258
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:00,720
No.

259
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,750
It's you...

260
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,310
who is always...

261
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,110
thinking of ways to protect me.

262
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,960
You're the most beautiful scenery

263
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,680
I've seen

264
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,720
in my most desperate abyss.

265
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:28,920
I am willing...

266
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,110
to follow you

267
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,350
for my whole life.

268
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,960
Lady Fairy...

269
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,110
Give me a hug...

270
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,270
Can you?

Rongrong.

296
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,240
I will summon the Black Fox with hatred

297
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,310

The peace of the six realms will be in your hands.

306
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,310
After the attack of the Black Fox this time,

307
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,670
I believe humans and spirits

308
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,590
will abandon prejudice

309
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,720
and cooperate.

310
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,550
One day,

311
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,720
the peace we want

312
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:32,880
will come.

313
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,480
Yaya.

314
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,540
Yiqi Alliance sent an alliance letter

315
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:18,970
[Alliance Agreement]

316
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,160
expressing their willingness to join hands with the Spirit Alliance

317
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,880
to make the six realms a place where humans and spirits can coexist in peace.

318
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,440
Honghong and Yuechu's wish

319
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,260
has finally come true.

320
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:29,830
When Honghong set up the illusion formation,

321
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,920
it was to hold back Yuechu

322
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,890
and stop him from risking his life.

323
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:38,470
Since Honghong started absorbing hatred,

324
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:41,880
she had decided to fight the Black Fox alone,

325
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:46,030
and close off all the passages for external invasion.

326
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,000
Yes.

327
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:51,200
He is the same.

328
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,590
He broke the illusion formation and rushed to the Grief Tree

329
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,520
just to coagulate the Tear of Void,

330
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:59,350
so that people gathered here

331
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:01,640
can see the Black Foxes with their own eyes.

332
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,400
He then use the Tear of Void to control the Black Foxes

333
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,240
and have the human and spirit clans join forces

334
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,840
to get rid of the Black Foxes.

335
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,200
Both of them

336
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:16,190
have never stopped protecting each other.

337
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,160
Yes.

338
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,590
When are you leaving?

339
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,990
You know everything?

340
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,070
Rongrong told me.

341
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:39,690
The messenger of Aolai Kingdom is just outside.

342
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:45,720
All right. We shall part ways here.

343
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:47,550
So...

344
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,160
soon?

345
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,640
In the past,

346
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,720
I can leave Tushan with you

347
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,010
and travel around the six realms with you.

348
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:01,110
But now I must stay

349
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:02,240
and protect Tushan.

350
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,480
For Honghong,

351
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,200
I will turn this place

352
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,550
back to what it used to be.

353
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,920
You're strong enough now.

354
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:25,240
You can shoulder the responsibility to protect Tushan.

355
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,480
Yaya.

356
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,790
If you need,

357
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,070
I can stay.

358
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,640
Lai can belong to me

359
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,700
and stay with me in Tushan.

360
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,440
But Aolai Sanshao can't just be Lai.

361
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,110
You belong to the six realms.

362
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,080
You will have a bigger sky

363
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:56,650
and more important responsibilities than Tushan.

364
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,690
I'll leave this Dinghai Rod

365
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,030
to you.

366
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,270
If you need anything,

367
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,120
I'll be back anytime.

368
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,070
See you.

369
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:56,110
I've sent Lai's expenses in Tushan

370
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,070
to Aolai Kingdom.

371
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:05,160
Honghong lost a lot of spirit power

372
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,720
and turned into a child.

373
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,350
She doesn't remember anything.

374
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:13,570
We need to find a way to make her recover as soon as possible.

375
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,790
Everything aside,

376
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,640
she keeps asking me what her name is.

377
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,440
Yaya,

378
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,550
why don't we tell her everything?

379
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,000
No!

380
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:24,030
She is so naughty.

381
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,070
If she knows

382
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,400
she is our elder sister,

383
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,690
how can we make her cultivate?

384
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,760
But we can't let her have no name.

385
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,640
Just call her Susu.

386
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,840
[Ya]

387
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,550
Brat.

388
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:47,210
You still haven't added this stroke you missed.

389
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,260
No matter what,

390
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,240
I have to keep and eye on Susu

391
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,170
so that she can recover to what she used to be quickly.

392
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,830
We can't waste this brat's

393
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,350
spiritual blood.

394
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:34,510
Susu,

395
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,540
I'm counting on you to complete the divine mission.

396
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,720
The divine mission?

397
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,350
This mission is to...

398
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,550
With the help of the Tear of Void,

399
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,240
this new Grief Tree

400
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,750
will help all the humans and spirits

401
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,440
who bond under it

402
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,640
continue their previous affinity.

403
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,270
Princess,

404
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,110
I'm here to take you home.

405
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:00,040
You promised to let me stay in Tushan for half a month.

406
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,590
It's only been a few days.

407
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,230
Looks like for this matchmaking event,

408
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,560
more humans and spirits

409
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,750
are coming to Tushan to bond.

410
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,480
Princess.

411
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:23,280
I...

412
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,000
So beautiful.

413
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,550
[Bond Wine]

414
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,670
Look, it's so beautiful.

415
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,800
Look how beautiful the fireworks are.

416
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,880
This is so bright.

417
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:38,920
So beautiful.

418
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,560
Princess.

419
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,510
I fell in love with you

420
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,030
at first sight.

421
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,320
All these years,

422
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,380
I cultivated day and night

423
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,990
and studied to handle politics.

424
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,710
I also worked hard to make the humans and spirits

425
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,000
get along peacefully.

426
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,630
I did these

427
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,960
because I want to be with you forever.

428
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,710
You know

429
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,050
my feelings for you.

430
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,630
The whole Beishan knows too.

431
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,940
I want to marry you.

432
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,550
Will you marry me?

433
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:53,000
When did you become

434
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,280
so eloquent?

435
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,000
So...

436
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:58,800
will you?

437
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,550
Yes, I do.

438
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,510
I want to

439
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,480
be with you forever,

440
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,030
until we grow old

441
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,060
and until the end of the world.

442
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:47,600
What are your capabilities? How can I use you?

443
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:48,840
I

444
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,150
can make people happy.

445
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,360
If you use me,

446
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:56,110
you'll be happy for the rest of your life.

447
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,150
How dare you

448
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,110
tease me?

449
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,920
Isn't this too shabby?

450
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:27,670
What if your mother

451
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,400
doesn't agree to our marriage?

452
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,960
Will you give up on me if she doesn't agree?

453
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,710
Then your love is too fragile.

454
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:35,510
How is that possible?

455
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,630
I like you.

456
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,030
I'll be with you forever.

457
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,840
That's right.

458
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,710
If my mother doesn't agree,

459
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,320
just cry hard.

460
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:48,070
If you cry, she will agree.

461
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,590
Really?

462
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,920
Of course.

463
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:54,840
I know my mother best.

464
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,480
She's soft-hearted.

465
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,630
She hates to see people cry.

466
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,880
So when you cry,

467
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:02,010
she will lose all her principles.

468
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,360
In that case,

469
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,590
she's quite like you.

470
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,320
Hu Weisheng.

471
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,440
I couldn't tell.

472
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:13,960
But you're quite smart!

473
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,800
Yes, I think so too.

474
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,790
Do you want a beating?

475
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,360
You want a beating?

476
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,320
There are eggs! Don't touch it!

477
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,030
Come back!

478
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,560
The Tear of Void opened up another dimension.

479
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,190
There,

480
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,920
our story

481
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:33,800
will continue.

482
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,550
Susu.

483
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,030
Susu.

484
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,800
Did you learn the magic properly

485
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,130
from the academy today?

486
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,480
Yes.

487
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,480
I've studied it for a hundred times.

488
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,360
What are you hiding?

489
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:07,070
A handsome guy gave it to me.

490
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,190
A handsome guy?

491
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:13,330
Where is he?

492
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,630
He was here just now.

493
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,150
Why did he disappear in a blink of an eye?

494
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,510
It's okay.

495
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:24,030
Maybe you can see him again.

496
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,370
Let's go.

♫Strumming out tears♫

512
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:47,500
How many years has it been

513
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:53,230
♫Flying past you in a flurry♫

514
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,330
since I came to Tushan?

515
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,750
This is the 27th year since you came to Tushan.

516
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:54,900
♫Listen♫

517
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:57,550
♫The wind blows, the longing rain♫

518
00:41:57,570 --> 00:41:59,020
27 years?

519
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:01,040
♫Spreading the memories of longing across the sky♫

520
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,840
I've been in Tushan for 27 years.

521
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,300
♫They are all my longings and feelings♫

522
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:08,820
♫My unresolved woe♫

523
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:05,880
Am I dreaming?

524
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,840
We really defeated the Black Fox

525
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:10,090
♫Listen♫

526
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,360
and saved everyone?

527
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,930
♫The wind blows and makes my heart flutter♫

528
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,900
♫But it's using falling leaves to prepare for this life's parting♫

529
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,880
You're not dreaming.

530
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:23,560
♫All my love and hate has something to do with you; our meeting was not in vain♫

531
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:20,760
It's all true.

532
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:23,440
That's good.

533
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,190
I'm so afraid

534
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:26,910
♫Who can hear my gaze♫

535
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,400
all of this is just a dream.

536
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,880
♫Speaking about love♫

537
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:31,890
♫Silently yearning♫

538
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,350
♫Who can hear my world♫

539
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:34,000
Don't be afraid.

540
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:39,570
♫The landslide of the mountain♫

541
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,280
Everything

542
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:37,920
has passed.

543
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:43,670
♫That's my troubles roaring like thunder♫

544
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,940
♫As I run towards you♫

545
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,230
I've been waiting for this day

546
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:53,570
♫I missed you silently for a moment♫

547
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,660
for my whole life.

548
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:54,800
Silly.

549
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:54,980

♫Spreading the memories of longing across the sky♫

552
00:42:58,710 --> 00:42:59,760
Your life

553
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,480
has just begun.

554
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,480
♫They are all my feelings♫

555

There will always be someone

560
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:19,360
♫Love and hate are related to you♫

561
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,550
who would scale mountains and come from afar

562
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:27,040
♫Our meeting was not in vain♫

563

and to protect you.

565
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:27,550
Spacetime

566
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:30,030
can't stop them.
