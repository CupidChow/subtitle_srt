[Episode 2]

4
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,910
To leave Tushan and get revenge for my parents,

5
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,860
I can make use of this

6
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,509
wolf spirit matter.

7
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,480
Fortunately, the Fox Spirit Academy

8
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,770
taught me a lot of tricks.

9
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,460
Today, I'll try the lowest-grade

10
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,449
disguise spell.

11
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,910
Although it's the lowest grade,

12
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,440
the disguise is quite good.

13
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:30,890
Liushang, Liushang!

14
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,410
Jiushuang?

15
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,360
Liushang.

16
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,870
Jiushuang, I went to see you just now.

17
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,590
Wuli said that

18
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,990
you went to ask the Deputy Chief for advice.

19
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:44,110
I've received my advice.

20
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,050
Liushang,

21
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,070
I know you haven't been

22
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,710
getting along with that human these years.

23
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,640
You lost a lot of fur because of him.

24
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,400
This is the black sesame pills

25
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,740
I got you from the market.

26
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,550
Jiushuang.

27
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,310
You're so nice to me.

28
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,150
I'm nice to you, right?

29
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,930
Liushang, I'm short of money lately.

30
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,750
As you know,

31
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,550
we female foxes use makeup a lot.

32
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,630
Those things are expensive.

33
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,150
I understand.

34
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,360
There are so many male foxes in Tushan.

35
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,870
I'm happy that you decided

36
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,360
to borrow money from me.

37
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,710
I knew it, you bald fox.

38
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,570
You're interested in Jiushuang.

39
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,430
Won't you hurry up and give it to me?

40
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,520
Okay.

41
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,520
Thank you!

42
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,670
You're not Jiushuang!

43
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,750
I didn't expect this fox to have so much personal savings.

44
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,560
Yuechu!

45
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,990
It's me. What's wrong?

46
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,050
You're so dumb, baldie.

47
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,360
You can't even recognize the low-grade disguise spell

48
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,560
that Yaya taught you.

49
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,640
For the sake of the money,

50
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,280
I won't get back at you

51
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,290
for exposing me

52
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,030
in front of Yaya today.

53
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,080
You bastard!

54
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,310
How dare you fool me!

55
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:05,550
Yuechu?

56
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,470
Rongrong.

57
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,080
Why are you here?

58
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,780
I have something good for you.

59
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:13,750
Hand.

60
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,450
Money?

61
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,670
Where did you get so much of it?

62
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,600
I borrowed them.

63
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,290
I know you like money.

64
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,250
It's all for you.

65
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,160
You're usually so stingy.

66
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,770
Why are you so generous now?

67
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,110
Tell me, what do you want from me?

68
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,480
You're indeed the most intelligent one in Tushan.

69
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,280
You're smart.

70
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,070
Rongrong, I heard the wolf spirit

71
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,530
who went to collect debts at the market died.

72
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,040
Can I take over?

73
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,960
I just came back to  the mountain with Honghong

74
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,810
and you've already heard about it?

75
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,090
You are well informed.

76
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,150
Rongrong.

77
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,630
All these years in Tushan,

78
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,100
I've been diligent and loyal.

79
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,490
And I've been good at math since I was young.

80
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,990
I'm the best man for the job.

81
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,290
Don't even think about it.

82
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,360
This matter is up to Honghong to decide.

83
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,870
She won't let you do it.

84
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,310
Can you not bother

85
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,270
Lady Fairy for such trivial matters?

86
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,140
You know Honghong is busy every day,

87
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,060
but you're still adding to her work.

88
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:12,670
Alright.

89
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,340
Anyway, don't think about

90
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,820
being the debt collector.

91
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,880
Give me back my money.

92
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,050
Give it back to me!

93
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,680
Speaking of money,

94
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,000
these are your expenses since you entered Tushan.

95
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,750
I've recorded them all here.

96
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,920
I've deducted the monthly salaries youâ€™ve earned from your work.

97
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,850
Pay me the rest as soon as possible.

98
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,360
You're just like a Pixiu beast,

99
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,510
all you do is take.

100
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,420
Damn woman.

101
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,270
How dare you ambush us?

102
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,070
Let go of us!

103
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,380
You two withheld information,

104
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,040
left the Villa,

105
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,440
and stayed around Tushan for so many years.

106
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,400
You coveted the spiritual blood for selfish purposes

107
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,260
and almost ruined Master's plan.

108
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,270
This is the Sorrowful Tear he gifted you.

109
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,710
Sorrowful Tear?

110
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,270
Just drink it.

111
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,060
This...

112
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,510
It's not necessary!

113
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,240
The Sorrowful Tear

114
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,560
needs the antidote every 7 days to stay dormant.

115
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,240
Once activated, it will corrode your organs

116
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,840
and you'll die from the pain.

117
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,370
This is the antidote for these seven days.

118
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,750
Master has ordered you two

119
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,750
to find a way to lure Dongfang Yuechu out.

120
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,550
If you dare to play tricks again,

121
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,820
even if you find the spiritual blood,

122
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,550
you won't be able to enjoy it.

123
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:47,680
Give it to me.

124
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,270
I'll go first.

125
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,630
Let me... Don't spill it!

126
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,720
It won't spill.

127
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,040
Let me go first.

128
00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:00,260
Jin Renfeng, that bastard.

129
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:04,070
I didn't expect that after all these years,

130
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,050
we still have to work for him in the end.

131
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,920
As long as we catch Dongfang Yuechu

132
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,170
and take the Dongfang Spiritual Blood,

133
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,960
even Jin Renfeng can't do anything to us.

134
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,300
Yes.

135
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,330
Dongfang Spiritual Blood.

136
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,600
Dark Force.

137
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,000
Why are these two powers mixed?

138
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:43,790
Lady Fairy.

139
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,120
Why are you here?

140
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,680
Lady Fairy.

141
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,490
I want to collect debts at the market.

142
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,270
You really want to go to the Spirit Market?

143
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,860
I've calculated it carefully.

144
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,160
Based on my current salary in Tushan,

145
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,170
even if I work for another 50 years,

146
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,920
I can't repay my debt to Tushan.

147
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,390
Besides, the job of collecting debts is vacant.

148
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,560
I can fill in for it

149
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,400
so that I can earn more money

150
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,930
and pay off my debt as soon as possible.

151
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,310
You just want to earn more money?

152
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,440
Lady Fairy,

153
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,120
besides making more money,

154
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,650
I have no other intentions.

155
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,630
Go if you want.

156
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,720
But I have to remind you.

157
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,150
Your Purest Sun Flame is weak.

158
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,120
Don't fight any battles

159
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,010
you cannot win.

160
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,200
Also,

161
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,150
the Heaven & Earth Thread is still in your body.

162
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,280
Donâ€™t try to escape.

163
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:56,960
Lady Fairy,

164
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,360
don't worry.

165
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,970
Tushan is my second home.

166
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,330
I won't run away no matter what.

167
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,670
Everything is predestined.

168
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,730
Since you want to seek revenge on Jin Renfeng,

169
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,790
Tushan can follow the clues

170
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,390
and find out the mastermind.

171
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,200
May the Grief Tree bless me.

172
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,080
As long as I can find

173
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,360
the Marriage Herb that boosts Grief Treeâ€™s power,

174
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,360
I'll go back to Tushan immediately.

175
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,200
Crane, as you expected,

176
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,490
a fox is about to step out of the boundary.

177
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,930
Once we capture a spirit from Tushan,

178
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,550
we can use her to threaten them

179
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,550
to hand over Dongfang Yuechu.

180
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,600
Marriage Herb!

181
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,670
Little fox, come with us.

182
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,310
We won't hurt you.

183
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,310
Tiger and Crane, prepare to die!

184
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,660
Yuechu!

185
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,480
Leave.

186
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:29,990
But you...

187
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,720
You go first.

188
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,610
Tiger.

189
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,560
What did she call him?

190
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,690
Yuechu!

191
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,280
You're that imp from back then,

192
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,790
Dongfang Yuechu?

193
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,840
God bless us.

194
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,630
It worked!

195
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,840
Yuechu.

196
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,870
You've grown so tall.

197
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,280
I might not even recognize you on the street.

198
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,610
Come on. Go back with Grandpa Crane.

199
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,710
Let's go.

200
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,390
Cut the crap, Tiger and Crane.

201
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:02,340
Today, I will avenge my dead parents!

202
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:10,430
How dare you

203
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:11,760
make trouble in Tushan?

204
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:27,840
Tu...

205
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,150
Tu...

206
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,510
You hurt the people of Tushan just now.

207
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,640
Chief,

208
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:40,100
that imp is a human.

209
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,960
Need I explain anything to you?

210
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,870
If you do it again,

211
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,920
I'll kill you all.

212
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,870
Since you knew

213
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:56,200
Yuechu wanted revenge on the Tiger and Crane Immortals,

214
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,460
why did you send him to collect the debts?

215
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,510
This is...

216
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,130
The person who killed Grey Wolf

217
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,440
had the aura of Dongfang Spiritual Blood.

218
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,970
Are you suspecting Yuechu?

219
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,210
No, that's impossible.

220
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,460
You put the Heaven & Earth Thread in his body.

221
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,110
If he stepped out of Tushan,

222
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,730
you'd definitely sense it.

223
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,270
Could it be him?

224
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,530
In this world, apart from Dongfang Yuechu,

225
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,360
only Jin Renfeng has Dongfang Spiritual Blood on him.

226
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,760
Since he also has the aura of Dark Force on him,

227
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,590
it means

228
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,550
he has something to do

229
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,430
with the person who corroded the Grief Tree.

230
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:38,070
So you took the risk and let Yuechu out of Tushan

231
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,350
to lure the fish to the bait.

232
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,670
Grey Wolf was the only outsider who could enter Tushan.

233
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,910
Jin Renfeng must have found out from him that

234
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,570
Yuechu is currently in Tushan.

235
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,460
He is a cunning person.

236
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,850
After what happened today,

237
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,660
he will surely take action in person.

238
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,860
That's why you sent Yaya down the mountain today.

239
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,660
It was to protect Yuechu, right?

240
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,510
Since you already sent Yaya,

241
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,760
why did you follow him in secret?

242
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,800
Keep an eye on him when you have time too.

243
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,230
Honghong.

244
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,230
Something is fishy about you.

245
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:25,310
[Divine Flame Villa]

246
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,270
Master.

247
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,150
Iâ€™m sure the person

248
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,630
who fought the Tiger and Crane Immortals today

249
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,830
was Dongfang Yuechu.

250
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,410
What should we do next?

251
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,900
Keep an eye on the Tiger and Crane Immortals.

252
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,510
As long as they are alive,

253
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,270
Dongfang Yuechu

254
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,410
will come here himself.

255
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,100
You're right, Master.

256
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,790
May you catch Dongfang Yuechu soon

257
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,480
and get what you want.

258
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,600
This is the elixir for internal injuries.

259
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,550
Put it on my tab.

260
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,190
Do you really think your debt

261
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,840
is less than that kid?

262
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,240
-Yuechu.
-Yuechu.

263
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,360
What?

264
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,460
Here to take revenge on me?

265
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,790
How can you think that?

266
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:53,840
You are so righteous.

267
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,190
Why would we take revenge on you?

268
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:55,910
Yeah.

269
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,780
I thought you were a bad guy.

270
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,780
I always badmouthed you behind your back.

271
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,900
But after what happened this time,

272
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,130
I realized you are as kind as us.

273
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:05,950
Yes.

274
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,600
Stop. Stop.

275
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,620
Just say it.

276
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,390
What are you doing here?

277
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,020
I brought you something good.

278
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:11,620
Look.

279
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,650
Jiushuang.

280
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:13,900
Have a seat.

281
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,010
I've kept this for years.

282
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,560
Do you usually read this?

283
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,960
It's very interesting.

284
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,630
I specially prepared this snack for you.

285
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,630
Try it.

286
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,380
Take a look.

287
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,720
So

288
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,420
you two are really here to make up?

289
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,010
I was at fault.

290
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,320
You saved Jiushuang this time.

291
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,840
You're my real brother from now on.

292
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,240
My brother's business is my business.

293
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,320
If you need help in the future,

294
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,180
just come to me.

295
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,150
Really?

296
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,150
Of course.

297
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,120
I'm not exaggerating.

298
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,440
I'm seriously injured.

299
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,330
Tomorrow morning,

300
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,320
I still have to wake up early and...

301
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:06,850
Alright.

302
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,800
Leave it to me.

303
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,100
Just take care of yourself.

304
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,120
Châ€¦

305
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,050
-Chief.
-Chief.

306
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,240
Lady Fairy.

307
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,840
Yuechu,

308
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,270
we'll leave if there's nothing else.

309
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:21,920
We'll visit you another day.

310
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,450
Alright.

311
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,270
How's your injury?

312
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,650
Have a seat.

313
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,080
Here.

314
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,030
Have some snacks.

315
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,240
My injury just hurts.

316
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,730
It hurts so much.

317
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,150
This is the medicine Rongrong gave you.

318
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,790
It looks like good stuff.

319
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,980
Thank Rongrong for me.

320
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,150
Of course,

321
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,920
you treat me the nicest, Lady Fairy.

322
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:01,910
Am I nice to you?

323
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,880
Of course.

324
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,069
Why not?

325
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:05,510
You saved me when I was young

326
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,310
and took me in.

327
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:07,960
Although

328
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,010
you often scold me,

329
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:11,270
it is a sign that

330
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,400
you care about me.

331
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,099
Do you really think so?

332
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,560
Of course.

333
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,680
No matter what,

334
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:21,190
Tushan is just and fair.

335
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,390
You saved Jiushuang's life.

336
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,690
I owe you a favor.

337
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,050
It's not easy to

338
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,660
repay me.

339
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,400
What do you want?

340
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,430
You'll know in the future.

341
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,790
Take care of yourself.

342
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,920
You don't need to do chores these days.

343
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,720
Really?

344
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,380
What about the salary?

run away to Human Market?

516
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,030
So you mean

517
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,550
Tushan should indulge them and let them not pay the rent?

518
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:07,070
Thenâ€“

519
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:07,790
All right.

520
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,390
Stop arguing.

521
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,830
I have something to discuss with Rongrong.

522
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:12,830
You may leave now.

523
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:13,990
Okay.

524
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,570
In order to not make Yuechu suspicious

525
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:27,300
and make a trip to Human Market,

526
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,340
you are doing everything you can.

527
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,270
Fortunately, he didn't realize that behind Mutong running away from the rent

528
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,600
is our push.

529
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,320
If he wants to lure Jin Renfeng to Human Market,

530
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,530
he'll surely let them know.

531
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:44,010
We just need to wait for him

532
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:47,000
to beg me to allow him to go to Human Market.

533
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,810
Jin Renfeng has always been sinister, cunning,

534
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:49,870
and unscrupulous.

535
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,020
In the past two years, he has been hiding in Divine Flame Villa

536
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,150
and rarely went out.

537
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,400
Only Dongfang Blood

538
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:57,080
can lure him out.

539
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,340
Why do you think

540
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,020
he's luring Jin Renfeng to Human Market?

541
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,900
Has he grown up

542
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,330
and now understands

543
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,880
your thoughts?

544
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,180
That you don't want

545
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,720
humans to start another war with the Spirit Clan,

546
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,200
nor get Tushan involved,

547
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,150
so he decided to go alone.

548
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,810
In the Dongfang family,

549
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:38,300
a woman's magical prowess is passed down by her blood.

550
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,200
Your mother's power

551
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,250
has been passed on to you.

552
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,850
That's why Divine Flame is unstable, you know?

553
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,100
Mother, I was wrong.

554
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,510
When I learn Purest Sun Flame,

555
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:53,340
I will roast sweet potatoes for you and Dad.

556
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:03,760
Father, Mother.

557
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,310
I will avenge you soon.

558
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,070
You're smart.

559
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,110
You can master it in a blink of an eye.

560
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,670
But you need to practice this magic spell

561
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,380
diligently

562
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,250
to maintain a long-term effect.

563
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,450
Thank you, Rongrong,

564
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,270
Yaya.

565
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,110
I can't repay your kindness.

566
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:52,080
If you need anything in the future,

567
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,170
I'll do anything for you.

568
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,000
You're welcome.

569
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,830
Don't always think about repaying the kindness.

570
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:00,110
Just stay in Tushan.

571
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:04,240
Look at me...

572
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,040
You don't have a place to stay in Tushan yet.

573
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,310
Rongrong.

574
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:10,930
I'll leave where Guoguo stays at to you.

575
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,750
Well...

576
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:13,770
It's not impossible.

577
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,840
It's just that the expenses...

578
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,100
Add it to my expenses.

579
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,570
I can just drink less.

580
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:22,050
It still won't be enough.

581
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,460
Then I'll take less salary.

582
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,560
More than half

583
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,510
of your salary is used

584
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,920
to pay back the debt you incurred from drinking wine.

585
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,580
What do you think we should do?

586
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,290
Yaya,

587
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,240
why don't you take the chance to quit drinking?

588
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:37,440
Rongrong!

589
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,250
Lady Fairy,

590
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,530
you should

591
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,800
smile more.

592
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,550
Don't try to bear all the responsibilities.

593
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,750
There are so many fox spirits in Tushan.

594
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,440
You need to take care of the market below the mountain too.

595
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,840
Even I feel tired for you.

596
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,440
Then tell me

597
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,610
how to be a chief who is not tired.

598
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:04,340
It's simple.

599
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,400
Grasp the large and let the small go.

600
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,400
Grasp the large and let the small go?

601
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,490
For example,

602
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:11,920
leave minuscule tasks such as going to Human Market

603
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,450
to chase back the rent to me.

604
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,660
You want to go to Human Market?

605
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,440
I've thought about it.

606
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:21,480
Tushan and humans have never interfered with each other.

607
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,310
If you or other foxes go there rashly,

608
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,600
it will cause unnecessary trouble.

609
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,000
Why don't you let me, a human

610
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,030
who grew up in Tushan, do it.

611
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,200
so we can solve it?

612
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:32,710
Looks like

613
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:35,240
you really care about Tushan.

614
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,550
Of course.

615
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,930
It's all for Lady Fairy and Tushan.

616
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,850
If you want to go to Human Market,

617
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:42,250
you have to pass me first.

618
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:46,200
What?

619
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,400
Lady Fairy!

620
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:49,820
Lady Fairy!

621
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,440
You can't use Purest Sun Flame.

622
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,110
You are...

623
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:08,110
afraid that I'll use Divine Flame in front of the humans

624
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,170
and expose myself?

625
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,060
Right now,

626
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:13,230
you shouldn't let more humans know your identity.

627
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:14,920
From now on,

628
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:17,720
I'll teach you a complete set of exorcism.

629
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,380
Got it.

630
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:39,480
â™«Longing dyes the old dream redâ™«

631
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,390
â™«May the three realms' chaos endâ™«

632
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:47,090
â™«You want to speak but stop yourself; leaving no conflictsâ™«

633
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,660
â™«Who is wavering?â™«

634
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:53,640
â™«Daytime never comes and the stars disappearâ™«

635
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:56,460
â™«My body is warm but I have nowhere to goâ™«

636
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:00,500
â™«I've been regretting for too long, and the fates start entangling in Tushanâ™«

637
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,600
â™«Hand in hand, we draw everything that happensâ™«

638
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,050
â™«Light rain falls in the courtâ™«

639
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:10,950
â™«Tugging on the spacetime that transcends realmâ™«

640
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,550
â™«Life is like a dreamâ™«

641
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,820
â™«But I've been missing you for a long timeâ™«

642
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,660
â™«I have cried all my tears and feel emptyâ™«

643
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:21,120
â™«I have looked back for thousands of times in hundreds of waysâ™«

644
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:25,020
â™«Dream that has been destroyed for eternityâ™«

645
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:27,380
â™«I decided to forget everythingâ™«

646
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:31,210
â™«And exchange my past for the present and futureâ™«

647
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:34,480
â™«Who will leave a trace of loveâ™«

648
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,280
â™«Under the Grief Tree?â™«

649
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:39,010
â™«Write that into sorrowâ™«

650
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,500
â™«Between right and wrongâ™«

651
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,880
Lady Fairy!

652
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,520
â™«Sword and revengeâ™«

653
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:42,790
It's ready.

654
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:46,160
â™«Protecting the peopleâ™«

655
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:48,790
â™«The first red flowers the white moon meetsâ™«

656
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,470
â™«Embracing across the skies and seasâ™«

657
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:52,980
â™«With mountains and rivers between usâ™«

658
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:55,800
â™«The ripples of the heartâ™«

659
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,240
Try it.

660
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:59,980
â™«Make my heart trembleâ™«

661
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:58,490
How is it?

662
00:32:59,140 --> 00:32:59,930
Not bad.

663
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:03,220
â™«Who will leave a trace of loveâ™«

664
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,670
This Divine Flame grilled sweet potatoes is a family recipe.

665
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,730
â™«Under the Grief Tree?â™«

666
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:04,880
No one in Tushan

667
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,160
â™«Write that into sorrowâ™«

668
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,590
can grill it better than me.

669
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,790
Lady Fairy.

670
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,370
â™«Between right and wrongâ™«

671
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,700
Speaking of which,

672
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,060
after I get the rent back from Human Market,

673
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,910
â™«Sword and revengeâ™«

674
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,190
â™«Protecting the peopleâ™«

675
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,550
I'll buy some white lime

676
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:14,960
and glutinous rice.

677
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:17,190
â™«The first red flowers the white moon meetsâ™«

678
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:17,440
With some Yangtao Vine juice,

679
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:18,610
â™«Embracing across the skies and seasâ™«

680
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,720
mixing them together,

681
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:21,290
â™«With mountains and rivers between usâ™«

682
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,660
we can fix the eaves that are leaking from the rain in Tushan.

683
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:24,890
â™«The ripples of the heartâ™«

684
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,070
Repair the eaves?

685
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,920
When the thatched roofs leaked when I was a child,

686
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:31,660
â™«Make my heart trembleâ™«

687
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,580
that's how my father fixed it.

688
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,400
So could it be he didn't bring Jin Renfeng into Tushan

689
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,790
because Tushan already has a place in his heart?

690
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:32,920
So, Lady Fairy,

691
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:36,390
when can I go to Human Market to chase back the rent?

692
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,910
Go get the ledger from Rongrong.

693
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,480
Sure!

694
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,790
Lady Fairy,

695
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,030
I will definitely get everything back

696
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:46,160
for Tushan.

697
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,790
Baby, come out.

698
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,000
My precious Flower Wine.

699
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:06,170
I've been out for so many days. I miss you so much.

700
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,340
Why is it empty?

701
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,690
What are you doing?

702
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,239
C-Chief.

703
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:23,250
How did it go this time?

704
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,960
Donâ€™t worry, Chief.

705
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:33,480
According to your instructions,

706
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,630
I've searched the other spiritual realms.

707
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,960
There is no trace of the Dark Force around.

708
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,550
So,

709
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,290
the person behind it this time

710
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,150
picked a human specifically.

711
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,570
You mean

712
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,199
this evil power

713
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:51,440
appeared on a human outside of Tushan

714
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,699
not out of coincidence

715
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,920
but that they are planning an even bigger conspiracy?

716
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:58,490
Do you remember what happened 700 years ago?

717
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,240
You mean...

718
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,450
someone wants to create discord between the humans and Tushan?

719
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:08,090
How is that possible?

720
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,440
I hope I'm overthinking.

721
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:15,230
What should we do next?

722
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:16,930
These days,

723
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,110
I found that Dark Force

724
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:21,040
seems to be related to Jin Renfeng.

725
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:23,650
I've set a trap to lure him into Human Market.

726
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,360
That's the jurisdiction of the head of the Yiqi Alliance, Wangquan.

727
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,760
He should be restrained there.

728
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:34,950
Divine Flame Villa's Jin Renfeng.

729
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:36,740
Very well.

730
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:39,310
I'll go meet this Fire Immortal

731
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:42,080
with you.

732
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:43,590
Okay.

733
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:44,890
Speaking of which,

734
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:46,030
after the war between humans and spirits,

735
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,800
Tushan has cut ties with the humans.

736
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,200
You haven't stepped into

737
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,280
the human realm for 400 years, right?

738
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,050
Chief?

739
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,510
Itâ€™s late.

740
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,840
Rest early.

741
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,510
Okay.

742
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,660
If you want to drink,

743
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,850
go get some from Huguang Pavilion.

744
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,610
Thank you, Chief.

745
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,160
I shall take my leave.

746
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,510
The sweet potatoes look cooked,

747
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:24,770
but they are still raw.

748
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:27,100
What Purest Sun Flame?

749
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,380
It can't even cook sweet potatoes.

750
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,180
Wait a minute.

751
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,870
I'll heat it up for you.

752
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,670
I promise you'll enjoy the food.

753
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,460
You're going to Human Market for rent tomorrow.

754
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:50,350
Why are you still in the mood to roast chicken here?

755
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:51,800
Lady Fairy.

756
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:56,660
It's become a habit after so many years.

757
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:59,260
Besides, roasting a chicken is not difficult.

758
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,430
Divine Fire is unstable.

759
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,710
Is something bothering you?

760
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,800
I'm just a little nervous.

761
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:13,860
After all, this is the first time I'm returning to the human realm after so long.

762
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,840
Let's not talk about me.

763
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,700
What about you?

764
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,490
Do you have something on your mind too?

765
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:22,030
Based on my understanding of you over so many years,

766
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,540
you are either training

767
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,880
or handling business at this hour.

768
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,170
You wouldn't have time to take a walk here.

769
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,080
Tell me

770
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:29,750
what you have on your mind.

771
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,920
It has nothing to do with you.

772
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:35,090
Of course it does.

773
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,330
I'm your sidekick!

774
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:39,840
Never mind.

775
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,230
Try it.

776
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,790
[Tushan]

777
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,030
Honghong.

778
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:55,510
Yaya.

779
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,630
The three of us were born from Grief Tree.

780
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,980
We have spirit power greater than the other foxes.

781
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,150
You're devoted to cultivation too.

782
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:06,670
All these years,

783
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,190
besides me,

784
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,470
you're the strongest in Tushan.

785
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,520
Honghong.

786
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,680
Why do you keep praising me these days?

787
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,590
You're making me blush.

788
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,690
Having great spirit power is your strength,

789
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,480
but also your weakness.

790
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,210
Think about it.

791
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,570
Every time something happens,

792
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,130
you always want to deal with it with spirit power, right?

793
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,670
You're right.

794
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:34,910
We can't protect Tushan with only spirit power.

795
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,480
I understand, Honghong.

796
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:39,520
But with you and Rongrong here,

797
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,080
I can be impulsive.

798
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,170
These days,

799
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:46,010
I need to leave Tushan to deal with some matters.

800
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,360
Without me,

801
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:50,000
I'll leave Tushan to you.

802
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,610
Where are you going?

803
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:53,470
It doesn't matter.

804
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:56,960
What matters is that you can protect Tushan well

805
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,090
and I will have nothing to worry about.

806
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,280
Don't worry, Honghong.

807
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,960
I will think before I do anything.

808
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,230
I won't fight if I can.

809
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:07,670
I will work together with Rongrong to protect Tushan.

810
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,030
Go ahead.

811
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:20,350
[Tushan]
