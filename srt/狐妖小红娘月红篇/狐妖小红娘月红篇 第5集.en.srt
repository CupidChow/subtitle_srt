[Episode 5]

4
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:55,610
Who are you?

5
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,280
I'm a hero

6
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,310
who can't stand by in face of injustice.

7
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,280
Cut the crap.

8
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,770
How are you related to Jin Renfeng?

9
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:06,480
Jin Renfeng?

10
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,990
Why'd you mention him

11
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,280
to dampen my spirits?

12
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,500
Don't bother with him.

13
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,480
Go find Honghong first.

14
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,150
Yes.

15
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,730
I'll leave this to you.

16
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,800
Finally, I've protected it.

17
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,010
Lady Fairy!

18
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,790
Lady Fairy, it's me.

19
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:58,760
It's me.

20
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,329
I hurt you.

21
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:22,800
Lady Fairy.

22
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,750
What's going on?

23
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,270
If I'm not mistaken,

24
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,120
the evil force in you

25
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,630
is the same force as the black fog

26
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,890
emitted by Grief Tree.

27
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:42,000
But how could the purest spiritual tree

28
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,800
have such an evil force?

29
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,470
If you can't tell me,

30
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,670
pretend I didn't ask.

31
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,610
I won't tell anyone about this.

32
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,900
I'll tell you.

33
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,800
For centuries,

34
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,160
Grief Tree's been corroded by the Dark Force.

35
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,960
After investigating for years,

36
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,690
I finally found

37
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,080
traces of Dark Force on Jin Renfeng.

38
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,120
But what about

39
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,320
the Dark Force on you?

40
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,750
Grief Tree's corrosion

41
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,480
affects me too.

42
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,480
I just didn't expect

43
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,900
it'd be so severe this time.

44
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,600
Is this force

45
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,780
related to the person you saw in your nightmare?

46
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,510
No.

47
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,050
Then who is he?

48
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,570
Just an old friend.

49
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,070
An old friend?

50
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,830
Dongfang Yuechu.

51
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,320
What are you thinking about?

52
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,750
He was just saving her.

53
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,520
He didn't say he likes her.

54
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,680
Why torture yourself over him?

55
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:13,830
Who is it?

56
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,480
Lady Fairy?

57
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,450
Take off your clothes.

58
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,480
Why?

59
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,550
Take them off.

60
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,630
I'm your sidekick and we're different species,

61
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,700
but men and women

62
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,380
still shouldn't be intimate.

63
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,190
How can I take off my clothes?

64
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,770
What are you thinking?

65
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,530
To apply medicine?

66
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,360
I see. I thought...

67
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,360
You thought what?

68
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:56,800
Nothing.

69
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,070
Apply it.

70
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,270
Done.

71
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,930
Thank you, Lady Fairy.

72
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,610
You're welcome.

73
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,630
Rongrong's told me what you did

74
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,210
to counter Renfeng's ambush of Tushan this time,

75
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,610
that you were brave

76
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,720
and responsible.

77
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,260
Rongrong sure is perceptive.

78
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:40,430
I don't wanna brag,

79
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,000
but I'm not your sidekick

80
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,340
for nothing.

81
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,290
In that case, I have a task for you.

82
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,790
If it weren't for the Dongfang Blood,

83
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:54,190
I'd have manipulated Tushan Honghong with hatred

84
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:56,270
to absorb her and Grief Tree's powers

85
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,800
to make a body.

86
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,680
Dongfang Yuechu...

87
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:07,600
Hurry up.

88
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,870
Be gentle.

89
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:10,270
You're so slow.

90
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,240
Listen.

91
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,870
What are you looking at?

92
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,930
Even if you're not Renfeng's accomplice,

93
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,460
you'll still be punished.

94
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:22,930
Let's see...

95
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,420
Which shop should I sell you to?

96
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,110
Yaya, you're here.

97
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,900
Try our new product,

98
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,560
Blessed Meatballs.

99
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,010
Yummy.

100
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,530
There's sauce inside.

101
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:39,960
Oh, right.

102
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,520
Do you still need a servant?

103
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,250
What about this big guy?

104
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,740
Stop there!

105
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,310
Over here!

106
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,200
Stop there!

107
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,740
Come on!

108
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,880
Stop there!

109
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:02,430
Come on.

110
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,730
You should keep Dinghai Rod safe.

111
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,540
You're in love with Aolai Sanshao?

112
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,420
It's not love.

113
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,730
Then what is it?

114
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,480
It's admiration.

115
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,360
Great gods are to be admired.

116
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,550
Love is shallow.

117
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,220
Forget it.

118
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,980
You won't get such things above your level.

119
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,560
Who on earth are you?

120
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,680
Honghong's received your message, Prince Lai.

121
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,270
Please head to Tushan.

122
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,700
So...

123
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,330
you're Honghong's guest?

124
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:56,250
Please.

125
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,220
They can give Renfeng Tushan's spirit aura

126
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,170
and know to use the dreamcatcher to deal with me.

127
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,820
Who could it be?

128
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,750
Honghong.

129
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,170
I've asked Prince Lai

130
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,820
to wait by Grief Tree.

131
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,630
Do you know

132
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,080
who set you up with the dreamcatcher?

133
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,030
Do you know

134
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,240
who I met in this nightmare?

135
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,840
Dongfang Luo.

136
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,420
How could it be him?

137
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,850
Few knew about this even back then.

138
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,410
After centuries,

139
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,070
let alone the human race,

140
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,540
even only a few

141
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,670
of Tushan's

142
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,730
older fox spirits know about it.

143
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,440
That's right.

144
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,980
Renfeng could sneak into Tushan silently

145
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,450
because he had Tushan's spirit aura.

146
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,310
How did he get the aura?

147
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,320
And the fox spell that attacked Elder...

148
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,160
You suspect...

149
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,020
the mastermind's related to Tushan?

150
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:06,720
Right now,

151
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,730
only one person fits the bill.

152
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,360
You suspect her?

153
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,500
No way.

154
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,160
Yes.

155
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,280
How could a fox spirit whose

156
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,760
body and soul were obliterated

157
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,270
do this?

158
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,530
[Tushan's former chief: Shi Ji]

159
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,150
I've been Tushan's chief

160
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,440
for centuries.

161
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,550
To think I'd be

162
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,700
forced to this plight

163
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,020
by a traitor.

164
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,310
It's your retribution.

165
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,320
Since you became chief,

166
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,840
you've been causing chaos.

167
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,700
Over 300 years,

168
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,240
has there been a day of peace in Tushan?

169
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,310
What do you know?

170
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,120
Everything I did

171
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,340
was for Tushan!

172
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,780
Was it for Tushan

173
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,650
or your ambition?

174
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,240
Tushan Honghong.

175
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,320
Remember this.

176
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,340
One day,

177
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,660
you'll pay the price for today's

178
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,120
reckless betrayal.

179
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,220
Tushan will always be mine!

180
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,710
The war between

181
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,460
Tushan and humans will now cease,

182
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,960
and I'll be

183
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:04,320
Tushan's protector from now on.

184
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,840
Be it her or not,

185
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,500
if they wanna harm Tushan,

186
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,630
I won't let them off.

187
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,920
Did you figure out what this is?

188
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,610
You came uninvited.

189
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,750
You must've found an anomaly.

190
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,790
It’s been years.

191
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,840
You’re still so straightforward.

192
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,240
Where are the pleasantries

193
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,640
to greet your old friend?

194
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,480
Cut the crap.

195
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,850
What did you see?

196
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,070
This black fog

197
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,670
looks similar to a force

198
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,090
I've seen before,

199
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,920
but it doesn't seem to be the same one.

200
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:14,950
Look.

201
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,730
Grief Tree's losing its power.

202
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,660
That's right.

203
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:21,500
I've never seen

204
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,660
a force that can seize others' powers.

205
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,670
Who could it be?

206
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,270
Regardless,

207
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,240
if they manage to seize all of

208
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,760
Grief Tree's power,

209
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,030
it might affect

210
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,400
Tushan and the six realms.

211
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,830
You've travelled a lot.

212
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,920
Have you heard of the soul-restoration spell?

213
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,600
Soul restoration?

214
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,570
Before you came here,

215
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,200
I've found some clues.

216
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:53,900
But the person I suspect

217
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,480
had her soul obliterated

218
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,960
centuries ago.

219
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,670
Have you heard of the Life Island?

220
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:02,930
Life Island?

221
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,960
You mean the island

222
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,290
at the circle's border?

223
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,360
Yes.

224
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,230
Life Island contains mysterious power

225
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,500
to restore souls and revive the dead.

226
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,910
It'd make sense

227
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,140
if an islander did it.

228
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,910
But all these years,

229
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,600
Life Island's been elusive

230
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,840
and never interfered with the six realms.

231
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,000
And I heard

232
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,270
the islanders vow at birth

233
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,360
to never step out of the island.

234
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,200
This is...

235
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,230
The islanders can't get out,

236
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,750
but outsiders may be able to get in.

237
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:45,570
You can find out

238
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,440
by sending men to the island to check.

239
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,070
But with the current situation,

240
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,210
I doubt Grief Tree can wait that long.

241
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:00,630
By the way,

242
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,340
since you've raised that Dongfang kid

243
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,370
in Tushan,

244
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,700
why don't you test him out?

245
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,870
Get up.

246
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,400
Go find that old fox who ran away.

247
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:26,110
It's Dongfang Yuechu's hidden weapon.

248
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,030
Go away.

249
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,240
You're a Dongfang descendant?

250
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,630
Why did Chief hide it from me?

251
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,630
Elder.

252
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,590
You're omniscient.

253
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,450
Do you know why?

254
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,690
I don't.

255
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,120
But many of Tushan's fox spirits

256
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:55,520
were killed by Dongfang's Divine Flame.

257
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,110
I remember it clearly.

258
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,480
Old fox, don't be impulsive.

259
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,000
Let me ask you.

260
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,079
Were those fox spirits

261
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,990
killed by Divine Flame

262
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:07,349
or by me?

263
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,260
The Human-Spirit war ended centuries ago,

264
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,160
even before

265
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,069
my grandparents

266
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:19,250
were born.

267
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:20,790
Every debt has its debtor.

268
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,329
Is it fair for me

269
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,520
to take the blame?

270
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,020
Are you asking me to find your ancestors?

271
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,590
If it can help you vent your anger,

272
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:31,460
why not?

273
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,690
-You…
-My ancestors are all dead anyway.

274
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:34,860
If you can find them,

275
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,590
you can make them pay the price.

276
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,030
Right?

277
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,470
Dongfang Divine Flame is so vicious.

278
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,590
Where are you hurt?

279
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,040
Let me see.

280
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,400
To think

281
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,120
the Dark Force

282
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,710
would not only seize Grief Tree's power

283
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,900
but also use its roots as a medium

284
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,990
to attack the land.

285
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,690
It’s only the Twin Peaks now.

286
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,140
If we don't stop it soon,

287
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,560
the entire Tushan will be...

288
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,360
Honghong.

289
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:10,790
Oh no.

290
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,500
Grief Tree's condition is getting worse.

291
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,360
Honghong.

292
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:18,010
Are you really not considering Prince Lai's suggestion?

293
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,330
You agree to sacrifice Yuechu too?

294
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,830
I just think

295
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,200
Prince Lai's more objective as a bystander.

296
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,330
Yuechu's lived in Tushan for 16 years.

297
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,640
Let alone us,

298
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,050
even the little foxes love him deeply.

299
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:34,700
Maybe we all forgot

300
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,670
why we kept him in Tushan.

301
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,640
Chief, you can't hesitate anymore.

302
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,200
Chief, you can’t hesitate anymore.

303
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,490
Offer the sacrifice.

304
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,960
Only pure Dongfang Blood

305
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,640
can suppress the vicious Dark Force

306
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,160
to save Grief Tree

307
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,600
and Tushan.

308
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,870
You know Yuechu's identity?

309
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,530
Chief.

310
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,550
If I hadn't

311
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,460
found out the truth from Fu Kui,

312
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,640
how long were you gonna keep it from me?

313
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,710
I will consider it myself.

314
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,880
It's the last resort.

315
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,790
I won't give up trying other ways.

316
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,000
Come on!

317
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,720
Stop there!

318
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,410
Return me my wine!

319
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,310
-Ouch!
-You imp! Come on!

320
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,480
Listen up.

321
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,340
When I was young,

322
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,200
everyone knew how formidable

323
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,240
I am.

324
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,750
It's easy to deal with small fry

325
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,880
like you.

326
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,440
Jiaojiao, you're so brave.

327
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,010
What did you call me?

328
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,550
Your name wasn't Tushan Buzui originally,

329
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,640
but Tushan Jiaojiao.

330
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,820
Don't blame me for being cruel.

331
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,920
I have

332
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,540
no choice.

333
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,070
For Tushan,

334
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,920
I'd have to give up

335
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:36,930
even my own life.

336
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:38,880
From now on,

337
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,290
I'll be a vegetarian for life

338
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,130
and accumulate merits for you.

339
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:55,830
Brat.

340
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,890
Tushan's raised you for 16 years.

341
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,140
It's time to contribute for Tushan.

342
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,250
He has spiritual blood.

343
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,880
This is his destiny.

344
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,830
He wouldn't be implicated

345
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,760
if not for the evil scheme.

346
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,880
That makes sense.

347
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,030
Then

348
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,440
what should we do?

349
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,000
It's Dongfang Blood.

350
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:43,310
Tushan Honghong's sacrificing it?

351
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,810
I can't fail!

352
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,200
Five-Yao Death Formation?

353
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,000
You're trying to kill me.

354
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,390
Renfeng's severely injured.

355
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,570
Why don't we work together

356
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,850
to take him out of Divine Flame Villa?

357
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,440
Once we arrest him,

358
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,360
we can follow the clues

359
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,920
to find the mastermind.

360
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,140
But if Yiqi Alliance is alerted,

361
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,000
it will be

362
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,460
catastrophic for Tushan.

363
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,670
Lady... Fairy.

364
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,690
That was close.

365
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,450
If the sacrificial formation hadn't been interrupted,

366
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,580
centuries worth of planning

367
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,840
might've been ruined by Dongfang Blood.

368
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,480
Tushan Honghong.

369
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,250
At this point,

370
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:54,470
how can you dream about protecting everyone with benevolence?

371
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,400
Ridiculous.

372
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:02,070
[Tushan's mini pavilion]

373
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,250
Honghong.

374
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,970
Luckily, it's just external injuries.

375
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:23,430
But I'd better send someone to the leech clan

376
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:24,460
to ask Cui Yuling

377
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:25,890
to treat him thoroughly.

378
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:26,960
Okay.

379
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,640
How's Yuechu?

380
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,180
He's fine now.

381
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,350
Chief.

382
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,490
Let’s go check out Grief Tree.

383
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,510
I just checked the tree

384
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,680
and found

385
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,340
it's losing its power faster.

386
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,840
Right now,

387
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,070
we can only reforge the tree's heart

388
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,240
for it to survive.

389
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,810
Forge a heart...

390
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,530
Humans need a heart to live.

391
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:55,960
Trees too.

392
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,310
That's true.

393
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:00,770
But it's not easy to reforge Grief Tree's heart.

394
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,930
Any good ideas?

395
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,370
Spirit bone.

396
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:12,110
Grief Tree's a spiritual being nurtured by Heaven and Earth.

397
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,970
The spirit bone of Tushan's chief

398
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:16,750
can transform everything into spiritual beings.

399
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,720
Even so,

400
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,220
you can't sacrifice your spirit bone

401
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,880
to reforge the tree's heart.

402
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,010
Why not?

403
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:29,590
Chief, you should know

404
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,560
that doing this

405
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,040
would bind your life

406
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,560
to this Grief Tree.

407
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,610
When it withers,

408
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,660
your soul will be obliterated

409
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,010
and you'll die with it.

410
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,200
Grief Tree

411
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,890
will not wither.

412
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,480
If you're decided,

413
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,110
I won't stop you.

414
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,000
But you'll need

415
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,880
to be more careful

416
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,510
and care for the Love Seed in your body.

417
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:02,830
You mean the power of a fox spirit comes from love?

418
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,200
That's right.

419
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,680
As the chief of Tushan,

420
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,620
you have the only Love Seed in the six realms.

421
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,520
You can connect with Grief Tree,

422
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,070
where lovers pray for bonds,

423
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,730
and transform their emotions

424
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:15,710
into love.

425
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,670
Without your spirit bone,

426
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:18,600
this Love Seed

427
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,620
is your last life support.

428
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,570
I understand.

429
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,830
Is he so important to you?

430
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,790
To protect him,

431
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,200
you'd even give up your spirit bone.

432
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,790
This is my mission.

433
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:39,410
It's dangerous to remove the spirit bone,

434
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:40,540
but I can still live.

435
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:44,190
If Yuechu gives his Dongfang Blood to the tree,

436
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,880
he will die.

437
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,960
Since there is a way out,

438
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,070
why choose death?

439
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,590
Why?

440
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,970
I've lived in Tushan for 16 years.

441
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,530
How could he try to kill me?

442
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,030
A human?

443
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,790
I've long heard there's a human in Tushan.

444
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,070
So it's him.

445
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:28,850
Let's go

446
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:29,530
take a look.

447
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,430
[Twin Peaks' flower spirit: Li]

448
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,430
[Twin Peaks' flower spirit: Feng]

449
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,480
My name is Feng.

450
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,640
Her name is Li.

451
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,270
What’s your name?

452
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,200
I'm asking you!

453
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,610
Are you the flower spirits who live in Twin Peaks?

454
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:47,350
What?

455
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,660
First time picking honey?

456
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,200
So what?

457
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,230
Don't look down on spirits.

458
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,640
We are both 50 years old.

459
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,360
Right?

460
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,000
Yes, we're 50.

461
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,160
So?

462
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,790
So in terms of age, you should speak formally to us.

463
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:06,050
Respect us and obey us.

464
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,150
Aren't you afraid of humans?

465
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,070
What's there to be afraid of?

466
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,610
You don't have more limbs than us,

467
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:15,090
nor do you fly as fast as us.

468
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,200
That's right.

469
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,350
But humans are evil and cunning,

470
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,280
using magic tools to deal with spirits.

471
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:24,500
Don't scare us.

472
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,600
What are you doing?

473
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,960
Chief, there’s a bad guy here.

474
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,830
You two go back first.

475
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,300
-Yes.
-Yes.

476
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,160
How is your injury?

477
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,440
Still resenting Elder?

478
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,680
I'm not.

479
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,000
I only blame myself...

480
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,440
for spending 16 years in Tushan.

481
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,270
At first, I was aware I'm a human

482
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,720
who's unlike you.

483
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,310
But as time passed,

484
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,350
I forgot that.

485
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:17,400
Elder made me come to my senses.

486
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,840
I'm an outsider,

487
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,200
a human,

488
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,200
a Dongfang descendant you detest.

489
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,310
So,

490
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,860
you purposely scared those two flower spirits?

491
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,490
I didn't mean to.

492
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,570
I'm quite close with everyone.

493
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:39,880
But...

494
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,870
As Elder took you as a villain,

495
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,540
you feel wronged.

496
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:44,640
So,

497
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:47,360
you really think of yourself as a villain.

498
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,620
It's not up to others

499
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,000
who you are.

500
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,290
Are you Dongfang Yuechu?

501
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,870
What kind of person are you?

502
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:58,000
It's all up to you.

503
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:00,010
It's nothing to do

504
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:02,600
with your background and what others say.

505
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,910
Next time you see Feng and Li,

506
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,750
apologize to them.

507
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:08,870
Let me

508
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,180
take you somewhere.

509
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,880
This is Tushan's

510
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,540
Forbidden Forest.

511
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:33,930
So high!

512
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:42,840
A human's here!

513
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:44,780
A human.

514
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,160
Ni.

515
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,280
Come here.

516
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,110
His name is Yuechu,

517
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,520
a human who grew up in Tushan.

518
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,940
He won't hurt you.

519
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,310
Go play.

520
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,500
Let's go play!

521
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,590
Their parents

522
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:29,660
were killed by humans

523
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,010
in the Human-Spirit War

524
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:32,920
centuries ago,

525
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,850
or in the recent conflicts

526
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,690
outside of Tushan.

527
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,830
Most of them

528
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,440
were killed by the Dongfangs.

529
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:46,050
It'll take a while for them

530
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,840
to get over their hatred towards humans

531
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,430
and the Dongfangs.

532
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,220
I can understand that hatred.

533
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:04,540
All these years,

534
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:08,470
has Tushan been secretly adopting these little spirits?

535
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,260
After the Human-Spirit War,

536
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:12,350
Tushan's been

537
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,350
staying out

538
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:15,680
of conflicts between humans and spirits.

539
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,500
We can only adopt these orphans in secret

540
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,770
and keep them here.

541
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,090
When they grow up,

542
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:24,160
they can decide where to go.

543
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,650
No wonder Tushan's so hard up.

544
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,080
It's because of the many adoptions.

545
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,360
Are you still mad at Elder?

546
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,720
I won't

547
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,910
call Rongrong stingy again.

548
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,650
I want to make more money for Tushan

549
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,240
so that these

550
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,570
parentless kids like me

551
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,550
can live a good life.

552
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,240
I hope there'll be

553
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,920
no hostility between

554
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,570
humans and spirits,

555
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,770
such that all children

556
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,700
can grow up freely and happily

557
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,470
with their parents,

558
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:04,050
and not be separated because of the ambition

559
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,550
of a select few.

560
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,050
[Tushan's Academy]

561
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,920
You want me to guard Tushan for you?

562
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,030
Yes.

563
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,250
I'll be cultivating in seclusion for a few days.

564
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:31,780
I can't take care of Tushan.

565
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,270
Luckily, your injury's almost healed.

566
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:38,340
You can divide the work with Rongrong.

567
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,480
Remember, always think twice.

568
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,610
Honghong, don't worry.

569
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,920
I'm Tushan's deputy chief after all.

570
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:47,010
I'll take good care of

571
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,790
Rongrong and other foxes.

572
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:51,440
If there's any problem, ask Lai for help.

573
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:54,920
By the way,

574
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,000
I heard that the white fox you picked up

575
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:00,110
is asking around about Lai.

576
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,480
What?

577
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,060
I'll teach Guoguo

578
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,540
a lesson when I get back.

579
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,440
Aren't you curious?

580
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,630
I am.

581
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,280
But you've always been cautious.

582
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:15,690
If you want to hide his identity,

583
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,130
I won’t ask.

584
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,190
Chief.

585
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,350
Deputy Chief.

586
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,080
Hello, Prince Lai.

587
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,520
Prince Lai, this way, please.

588
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,820
Are you okay today?

589
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:32,960
As they say, an exchange of blows lead to friendship.

590
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,670
It was all just a misunderstanding.

591
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,320
You're Honghong's good friend,

592
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,920
so you're my good friend too.

593
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,430
All right, you may leave.

594
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,940
I have something to discuss with Lai.

595
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:43,760
Okay.

596
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,440
Your sister's really interesting.

597
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,620
Please don't tell her

598
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,360
I'm removing my spirit bone.

599
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,400
Why?

600
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,290
Among us three sisters,

601
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:00,170
Yaya's the most carefree one.

602
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:03,470
I don't want these things to affect her.

603
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,210
But why do I think

604
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:08,150
a carefree woman like her

605
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,880
shouldn't just be sheltered?

606
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,800
Just a suggestion.

607
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,800
It's all up to you.

608
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:16,070
By the way,

609
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,440
how's the preparation for removing your spirit bone?

610
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,670
Are you troubled?

611
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,280
No.

612
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,670
Don't lie.

613
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,400
I'm not.

614
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,950
Come on. Tell me.

615
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,620
Let me ask you.

616
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,450
What do you think of me?

617
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:57,330
Not bad.

618
00:36:57,890 --> 00:36:59,290
Affectionate and loyal.

619
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,070
What about other humans?

620
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,070
Suddenly?

621
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,670
You hate humans, don't you?

622
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,710
Yes.

623
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,130
But it's not just me.

624
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,630
Every spirit in Tushan

625
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:16,070
hates humans.

626
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,970
Besides,

627
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:20,170
no humans like spirits either.

628
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,320
Do you believe

629
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,540
there'll come a day

630
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:31,090
when humans and spirits are friends?

631
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,220
Are you drunk?

632
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,810
How many fingers do you see?

633
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,830
Just go drink your wine.

634
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,960
I need alone time.

635
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,400
I'm leaving.

636
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,480
Thank you.

637
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,320
Good wine.

638
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,840
Humans and spirits coexisting in harmony.

639
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,440
Prince Lai.

640
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,600
Please wait here.

641
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,980
I’ll go investigate.

642
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,740
Aolai Sanshao was born from the spiritual energy of heaven and earth?

643
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:30,070
He can turn air into mountains and tears into seas?

644
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,590
What a pack of lies.

645
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,230
Mountains existed before Sanshao was born.

646
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:34,800
Also,

647
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:37,180
Sanshao does live by the sea,

648
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,540
but it doesn't mean he created it.

649
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,770
You don't understand.

650
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,320
Think about it.

651
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,440
Except Honghong,

652
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,720
Sanshao's the most powerful being in the world.

653
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,280
With one wave of his Dinghai Rod,

654
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,880
he can draw a circular boundary

655
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,160
to protect all lives,

656
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,690
including humans.

657
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,030
Why can't a hero like him

658
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,000
summon the wind and rain

659
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,590
to create seas and mountains?

660
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,860
He’s not some hero.

661
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,080
You think too highly of him.

662
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,360
If he knew

663
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,230
drawing that boundary

664
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,830
would use up so much of his power,

665
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:14,000
he'd reconsider it.

666
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,550
Nonsense!

667
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,610
A small fry like you

668
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,960
can't fathom the level

669
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,780
he's at.

670
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:21,680
It's not nonsense.

671
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:23,400
As a kid,

672
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,280
he fell off clouds often.

673
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,050
You...

674
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,720
Let me tell you.

675
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:30,370
I hate people like you who slander others.

676
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,510
Are you jealous of him?

677
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:34,610
Come on.

678
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,360
Where's your conscience?

679
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,650
How dare you

680
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,190
slander a great god?

681
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,640
I really know a lot about Sanshao's true colors.

682
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,320
Go away.

683
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,010
Keep your distance from me.

684
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:55,920
Sanshao

685
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:58,180
actually has such a supporter.

686
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,200
Old Fox?

687
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:23,880
Old Fox.

688
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:28,930
Jiaojiao?

689
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,990
The heavens let me run into you tonight.

690
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,730
I don't blame you because you had a reason

691
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:45,660
for what you did,

692
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,320
but I have to vent my anger.

693
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:59,910
No way. I didn't even touch you.

694
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:00,990
Why are you crying?

695
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:06,280
Don't tell me it's because

696
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:07,900
you failed to kill me?

697
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:13,100
You know nothing.

698
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:17,150
I feel sorry for Chief.

699
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,000
Lady Fairy?

700
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:22,850
What's wrong with her?

701
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,880
Tell me!

702
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:32,150
Tomorrow morning, she'll remove her spirit bone

703
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:35,380
to reforge the Grief Tree's heart.

704
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:38,920
Remove her spirit bone

705
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,370
to reforge the Grief Tree's heart?
