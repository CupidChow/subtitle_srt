4
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,350
It's been three years since we last met,

5
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,610
Young Master Nangong.

6
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:55,370
No.

7
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,860
I should call you Master Nangong now.

8
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:59,229
How have you been?

9
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:01,000
Cut the crap.

10
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,640
What do you want?

11
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,230
Fine.

12
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,370
I'll get straight to the point.

13
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,800
I heard that you recently insisted

14
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,480
that the missing girl was captured by the Spirit Alliance.

15
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,340
I'm sure you have solid evidence.

16
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:19,040
Why don't we ask the Director of Wangquan for permission

17
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,310
to save these missing people together?

18
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,310
What do you think?

19
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,480
Save them?

20
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,290
I heard that you're a traitor

21
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,040
who sides with the Spirit Alliance.

22
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,300
A person like you

23
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,160
has no right to ask for the Director's permission.

24
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,010
Speaking of rumors,

25
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,360
I also have a rumor

26
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,530
I would like to hear your thoughts on.

27
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,270
I heard that before the old master of Nangong died

28
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,190
from relapse, he drank a bowl of medicine.

29
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,710
And this medicine

30
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,560
was given by you, his only son.

31
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,360
Don't you dare slander me!

32
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,380
Calm down.

33
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,150
It's just a rumor.

34
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,700
Rumors are not believable.

35
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,680
What are you trying to do?

36
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,040
It's simple.

37
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,640
If there is no evidence,

38
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,900
remove your slander against the spirit clan

39
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,020
so the peace between the two alliances isn't disturbed.

40
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,500
You are indeed a spy

41
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,640
planted by the Spirit Alliance.

42
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,200
Wrong.

43
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,540
Everything I do is for the Yiqi Alliance.

44
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,020
If the two alliances fall out,

45
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,470
the innocent people will suffer.

46
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,829
As an outstanding member of the Yiqi Alliance,

47

I'm sure you understand what I mean.

48
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,150
That's right.

49
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:45,740
The Nangong family was secretly investigating this matter

50
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,870
and gained some findings.

51
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,500

52
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,610
I've reported the findings to the Director.

53
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,500
Since you're so eager to be righteous,

00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,200
just catch the culprit.

All the girls who went missing

59
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,630
were abducted by this evil spirit.

60
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,380
He put up a public bounty to catch this spirit.

61
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,630
Isn't he afraid of becoming a laughingstock?

62
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,390
Maybe he loves his daughter too much.

63
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,380
His daughter was killed by an evil spirit.

64
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,430
He couldn't care less about his reputation.

65

I've searched everywhere these days.

But I didn't find any trace of the missing women.

78

But today, someone from the Yiqi Alliance

79
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,480
posted a notice and stated that

80

In the past few years,

there have indeed been cases of female assault among humans.

Since I started supervising this place a year ago,

124
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,920
I found that you sneeze

whenever it rains.

126
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,490
I carefully sniffed out the differences

Rongrong is also known as the Thousand-Faced Spirit.

If the woman abductor is also good at disguising himself,

Kongxian Mountain has no contact with Tushan.

273
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,910
By right, I shouldn't take you in as my disciple.

But considering your sincerity,

275
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:50,270
I will take you in today.

Tushan has its own rules.

278
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,780
We only save people, not harm people.

279

In the future,

281

you must obey this rule.

00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,860
Let me in. I know her.

349
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:51,980
I know her.

350
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,260
Constable Lyu!

351
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,590
Let him in.

352
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,470
Nice to meet you, Constable Lyu.

353
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,220
You're Yuechu. I remember you.

354
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,150
At the alliance tryout 3 years ago,

355
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,570
you humiliated Nangong Shi.

356
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,300
In the past three years,

357
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,970
I've heard a lot about you.

358
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,500
I heard that you made magic tools

359
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,200
and mediated many disputes between humans and spirits.

360
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,550
You're too nice.

361
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,810
Do I have a great reputation now?

362
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,140
It seems that you are as brazen as the rumor says.

363
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,470
Tell me, what's the matter?

364
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,780
Here's the thing.

365
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,060
I heard that you're smart

366
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,590
and have an excellent sense of smell.

367
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:34,780
Maybe this time

368
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,790
we can use your unique skill

369
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,690
to capture the woman abductor.

370
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,500
After all, appearances can change easily,

371
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,550
but it's hard to change one's scent.

372
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,880
Do you have any clues about this?

373
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:50,170
[Zhilan Garden]

374
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,600
Miss.

375
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,040
I never break my promises.

376
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,960
Quit struggling.

377
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:32,550
You might hurt yourself.

378
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:34,850
You're not Ms. Fu.

379
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,030
Where is she?

380
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,260
She knew you were the woman abductor.

381
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,780
I see.

382
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:42,510
If she can discuss a new plan with others,

383
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,310
it means she must be feeling better now.

384
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,630
No matter what,

385
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,090
I will arrest you tonight.

386
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,530
The evil spirit has escaped.

387
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:54,110
After him!

388
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:54,880
-Yes.
-Yes.

389
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,950
Master...

390
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,760
You three go over there.

391
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,520
-Yes.
-Yes.

392
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:19,820
Over here.

393
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,950
Still nothing.

394
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,920
Has the woman abductor been subdued?

395
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,520
Something happened to Fu Cheng.

396
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,060
Check over there.

397
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,000
What happened?

398
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:16,000
Fu Feng and I were tracking that evil spirit,

399
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,330
but he didn't come here.

400
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,020
Besides,

401
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,050
there's no scent of that evil spirit here.

402
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,460
The one who abducted Fu Cheng

403
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,120
was not him.

404
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,300
So there's more than one woman abductor.

405
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,120
Our priority

406
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,980
is to save Fu Cheng.

407
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,320
Constable Lyu,

408
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,890
I can only count on you.

409
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,470
Since you arrived immediately

410
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,140
after receiving my message,

411
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:48,870
it means you haven't forgotten your master.

412
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:51,080
Why do you say that?

413
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,290
Let me ask you.

414
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,550
When you came to Tushan to learn from me,

415
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,860
what did you promise?

416
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,870
To...

417
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,640
pay my tuition fees on time?

418
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,460
No.

419
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,540
The other one.

420
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:07,600
Keep track of my daily expenses?

421
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:11,200
Have you forgotten what I taught you?

422
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:12,660
Master,

423
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:16,510
back then, apart from being chased by you for money,

424
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,910
I don't remember anything else...

425
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,310
I taught you for nothing.

426
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:20,690
I got it!

427
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,840
I must have forgotten

428
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,310
to send you the offering this year.

429
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:31,140
No wonder Rongrong only has one disciple.

430
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,640
Are you the woman abductor,

431
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:34,970
Yan Rushan?

432
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:36,470
Master,

433
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:39,590
those ladies were either forced into marriage by their family

434
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,250
or wronged by unfaithful men.

435
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,590
I did all those things to help them.

436
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,050
Shut up!

437
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,500
So many women have gone missing.

438
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,390
How dare you defend yourself?

439
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,130
Missing?

440
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,170
Impossible.

441
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,010
I've never taken anyone away.

442
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,950
Lady Li from the Xuan family.

443
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:00,680
Lady Ba from the Jin family.

444
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,000
I've never met these women before.

445
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,930
Looks like someone is trying

446
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,350
to cover up the truth.

447
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,230
But why are they doing this?

448
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,190
Rongrong.

449
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,610
Find out

450
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,980
the background of those missing women.

451
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:26,390
See if any of them knows anything about construction.

452
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:27,240
Yes.

453
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,060
Fu Cheng's scent is getting stronger.

454
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,260
She should be nearby.

455
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,350
This piece of your memory

456
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:18,170
is now mine.

457
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,220
This is the last piece of memory

458
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,460
related to the Huntian Prison.

459
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:32,760
Back then,

460
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:36,180
the Fu family was quite famous in the Yiqi Alliance.

461
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,740
Most of the Huntian Prison's buildings

462
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,460
were made by the Fu family.

463
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,060
Their family should have

464
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,950
the most blueprints on the

465
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,300
Huntian Prison.

466
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:46,950
Unfortunately,

467
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,190
the last successor of the Fu family

468
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,460
died just like that.

469
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:54,400
Master Nangong, you're not yet the Director,

470
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:56,510
but you're already showing kindness

471
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,230
and sympathizing with all living beings.

472
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,310
Survival of the fittest.

473
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:03,880
Who can she blame

474
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,470
for being so weak?

475
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,260
I admire your spirit of self-improvement,

476
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,910
Master Nangong.

477
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,020
With this last clue,

478
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:15,260
breaking into the Huntian Prison

479
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,700
will be a piece of cake.

480
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,700
Over there.

481
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:34,980
Fu Cheng!

482
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,630
Fu Cheng!

483
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,350
Fu Cheng.

484
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:42,350
Fu Cheng?

485
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:43,870
Fu Cheng!

486
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,670
Huntian

487
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,220
Prison.

488
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,670
The Fu family.

489
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:56,560
Huntian Prison?

490
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:58,190
The Fu family?

491
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,300
Second Young Lady once mentioned that

492
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,540
the Fu family's ancestors took part in building the Huntian Prison.

493
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,670
The Huntian Prison might be in danger.

494
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,620
Take her back for treatment.

495
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:08,460
The rest of you,

496
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,950
follow me to Huntian Prison.

497
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:10,430
Yes.

498
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,280
The Huntian Prison?

499
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,100
Yes.

500
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,870
The ancestors of the missing women on the list

501
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:18,870
were involved in the construction of Huntian Prison.

502
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:28,690
Master,

503
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,740
I have nothing to do

504
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,940
with Huntian Prison.

505
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,640
I trust you.

506
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:35,750
But now,

507
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:38,570
the enemy is killing under your name.

508
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:41,240
You cannot stay out of the matter.

509
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,670
Besides,

510
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,730
you've broken a rule

511
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:46,800
for cheating on women's feelings.

512
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,600
Master,

513
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,300
what should I do now?

514
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,160
Please enlighten me.

515
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,640
The only way now

516
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:55,810
is to redeem yourself.

517
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,150
Find the truth as soon as possible

518
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:59,740
to calm down this storm

519
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,460
and clear your name.

520
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,330
Thank you for your advice.

521
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,280
The Huntian Prison.

522
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,510
Once we release

523
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,470
those evil spirits inside,

524
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,400
the six realms will be in chaos.

525
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,620
Peace between humans and spirits?

526
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,190
How naive.

527
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,020
Sir.

528
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,030
The situation has changed.

529
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,880
There's news from Tushan

530
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:33,150
that Tushan Honghong has noticed

531
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,540
our actions.

532
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,540
We must act

533
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,950
before them.

534
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:40,590
Yes.

535
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,380
When they built the Huntian Prison,

536
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,320
a secret passage was indeed left behind.

537
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,370
If we follow this passage,

538
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:59,480
we can enter the Huntian Prison silently

539
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,750
and release those evil spirits.

540
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,260
Right now,

541
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,590
we're under the Huntian Prison.

542
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:24,740
In a while,

543
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,920
once the evil spirits escape,

544
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,910
the humans and spirits will surely fight each other.

545
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,390
By then,

546
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:35,100
you'll be able to show off your skills.

547
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,330
Is the famous

548
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,280
leader of Chi Sha Bandits, Chi Lei,

549
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:14,790
content with being imprisoned here?

550
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,190
Who are you?

551
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,810
The person who will help you escape.

552
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:21,070
Open all the doors of the Huntian Prison,

553
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,590
release fellow spirits

554
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:25,010
who lost their freedom like you,

555
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:27,390
and kill the people of the Yiqi Alliance.

556
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:51,110
It's been a long time since I had such a good time.

557
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:09,800
[Member of the Chi Sha Bandits, Ye Mei]

558
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:09,830
[Member of the Chi Sha Bandits, Xue Zang]

559
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,350
Destroy this place.

560
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:21,260
In the future, there will be no more Huntian Prison.

561
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,580
Honghong...

562
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,910
The Chi Sha Bandits are enough.

563
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,980
For the spirit who escaped from the Huntian Prison,

564
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:29,480
the Spirit Alliance will chase them to the end of the world.

565
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,500
Take these evil spirits back to their cells.

566
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,630
I've done what I promised you.

567
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,950
When can you fulfill

568
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:41,910
your promise?

569
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:44,350
Tushan Honghong, leader of the Spirit Alliance,

570
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,980
broke into the Huntian Prison

571
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,510
and let the evil spirits go.

572
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,360
This is a good opportunity.

573
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:52,780
It's up to you to seize it, Master Nangong.

During my years of work,

606
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,750

♫My missing descend from the sky♫
