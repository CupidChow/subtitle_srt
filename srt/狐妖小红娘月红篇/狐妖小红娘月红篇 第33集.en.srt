4
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,509
Hu Weisheng.

5
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,229
Come here.

6
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,570
What's going on?

7
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:23,490
He's proposed marriage to me.

8
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,300
Why can't I retrieve it?

9
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,940
Is Mother wrong?

10
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,280
Was his proposal

11
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,350
not out of true love?

12
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,400
Let's

13
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,190
part here.

14
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,130
It's safe here.

15
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,810
The Ximens won't be able to catch up to us soon.

16
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,440
You...

17
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,020
What do you mean?

18
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,560
I won't ever like spirits.

19
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,660
I'll never like you

20
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,420
or go to your house to propose.

21
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,430
You can't go.

22
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,290
We are engaged.

23
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,690
Then... I'll follow you

24
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,090
wherever you go.

25
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,240
Out of countless men in the world,

26
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,770
why do you have to pester me?

27
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,840
I...

28
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,520
Because I like you.

29
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,090
I don't believe it.

30
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,360
You don't have a twin sister.

31
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,760
It was just you

32
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,410
from the beginning.

33
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,710
You clearly wanted to kill me.

34
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,360
Later, you lied to me that you like me.

35
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:44,800
Then I...

36
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,930
I fell in love with you later, okay?

37
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,720
What kind of reason is that?

38
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,820
Do I need a reason to like someone?

39
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,870
Conditional love is shallow.

40
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,070
You don't need a reason to love someone!

41
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,000
I won't like spirits anyway.

42
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,680
Fine.

43
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,000
You can leave.

44
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:26,840
Leave!

45
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:29,930
Anyway,

46
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,120
you don't truly like me.

47
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,290
Darn it.

48
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,590
He really left.

49
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,170
Forget it.

50
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,970
Let's find another way.

51
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,270
In this world,

52
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,120
I think...

53
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,070
you're the only one who loves me.

54
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:28,880
How about...

55
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,440
I try to make it work?

56
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,810
♫The red leaves set us ablaze♫

57
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:39,070
♫The snow drains our warmth♫

58
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,290
♫We keep parting and loving each other again♫

59
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:45,290
♫Living life like a dream♫

60
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:49,060
♫My heart and mind are always conflicting♫

00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,880
♫I have passed by so many people♫

♫All that is left♫

63

♫Is my reflection in your eyes♫

64
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,290
Tushan Honghong.

65
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,270
This is the power of hatred.

66
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:15,680
Black Fox.

67
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,280
To think you'd enter the circle through Grief Tree.

68
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,100
You noticed?

69
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,920
But it doesn't matter.

70
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,770
We'll be the same kind soon.

71
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,880
The power you depend on deep down

72
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,930
is the same as mine.

73
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,050
Am I wrong?

74
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,710
After seriously injuring Dongfang Luo,

75
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,070
didn't you harbor hatred in your heart?

76
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:44,780
You hate yourself.

77
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,250
And you'll always be this way.

78
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,420
You and I will never be the same.

79
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,470
There are two emotional forces: love and hatred.

80
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:57,080
Grief Tree absorbs emotional forces

81
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,150
and supports itself with love.

82
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,350
But the truth is hatred is more common than love.

83
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,510
The hatred from the bottom of our hearts

84
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,720
is enough to devour the six realms.

85
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,720
So you're ruining

86
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,780
the peace between humans and spirits

87
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,070
to use this hatred

88
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,270
to become powerful?

89
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,740
Black Foxes respect those with strong hatred.

90
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,500
To control Black Foxes in the circle,

91
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,400
you have to absorb hatred.

92
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,350
Tushan Honghong, do you dare?

93
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:28,310
Your deepest love will become your deepest hatred.

94
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,040
You'll definitely experience

95
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,840
being invincible again.

96
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,490
What you saw when you were in the Mist Formation

97
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,679
will happen.

98
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:41,429
Dongfang Yuechu will join us.

99
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,960
It's easier for him to hate you than love you.

100
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,670
He killed Tushan Buzui.

101
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,820
He'll keep killing more and more.

102
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,710
You'll hate him so much

103
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,790
you'll want to kill him yourself.

104
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,600
By then,

105
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:00,910
you'll be our best ally to invade the six realms!

106
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,360
So Grief Tree's

107
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,030
the passage for Black Foxes to invade the six realms.

108
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,840
Then everyone

109
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,200
in the six realms

110
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:18,050
must see Black Foxes' true colors.

111
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,480
Give it to me.

112
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I want to play.

113
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,870
Before I knew it,

114
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,670
they were only an inch away from me.

115
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,270
They thought Yuechu saved me.

116
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,580
Actually, I saved him.

117
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,800
How can these spirits be so happy?

118
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,200
They even hang out with humans.

119
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:54,190
I should teach them a lesson.

120
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,970
Darn spirits.

121
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,600
Fu Cheng!

122
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,780
-Where's Yuechu?
-Yaya.

123
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,440
I'll kill him to avenge Elder.

124
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,180
Yaya.

125
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,310
Yaya, calm down.

126
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,350
Elder was killed

127
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,080
by a Black Fox, not Yuechu.

128
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,440
Yaya.

129
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,480
Once a Black Fox possesses a fox spirit,

130
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,080
it'll devour the host's spiritual consciousness.

131
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,080
He had no choice.

132
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,150
Yaya.

133
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,600
Let's just send Elder off so he rests in peace.

134
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,330
I don't care.

135
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,510
Honghong just came back,

136
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,050
so Yuechu must still be around.

137
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:51,840
Yaya!

138
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:52,520
Hang on.

139
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,360
Let her go.

140
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,350
After what happened,

141
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,030
they both must feel awful.

142
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,030
Her making a scene

143
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,000
might resolve

144
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,480
their emotional turmoil.

145
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:06,910
I hope so.

146
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,800
What did you call me?

147
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,200
Tushan Jiaojiao!

148
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,270
Tell me.

149
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,370
Come and get it!

150
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:30,910
Stop there!

151
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,320
Return my wine!

152
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:32,910
Come on!

153
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,530
Old fox.

154
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,280
Back then,

155
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,770
you said you left the mountain for Honghong.

156
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,900
But ever since you became the director,

157
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,270
do you still care about Tushan?

158
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,120
I do.

159
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,830
But I'm also Yiqi Alliance's director.

160
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:06,500
In my heart,

161
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:07,860
humans

162
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,260
and spirits

163
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,720
are the same.

164
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:12,720
So,

165
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,130
to protect Yiqi Alliance members,

166
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,790
you killed Elder yourself.

167
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,000
I...

168
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,470
I won't make any excuses for what I did.

169
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,160
I'll take...

170
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,200
full responsibility.

171
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,290
Take responsibility?

172
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,000
How?

173
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,360
Can you bring Elder back to life?

174
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,510
Or...

175
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,870
can you pay with your life?

176
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,120
If I can

177
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,280
exchange my life for his,

178
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,850
I'd do it.

179
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,240
Dongfang Yuechu.

180
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,360
Has Tushan ever wronged you?

181
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,720
That's Elder.

182
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,470
He's our elder who taught us

183
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,690
and accepted our teasing.

184
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,900
There's trouble in Peace Village.

185
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,200
Fu Cheng!

186
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,850
What's wrong with you?

187
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:48,790
Wake up!

188
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:50,490
Fu Cheng!

189
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,150
Kill them.

190
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,360
Kill them.

191
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,130
Fu Cheng...

192
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,640
Liushang!

193
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:46,450
Liushang.

194
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,530
Liushang.

195
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:51,760
Jiushuang.

196
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,600
Liushang!

197
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:54,900
Jiushuang.

198
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,600
Tell Yuechu...

199
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,590
I believe

200
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,890
peace between humans and spirits

201
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,760
will happen.

202
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,150
Liushang.

203
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,120
Liushang!

204
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,600
Peace between humans and spirits?

205
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,030
Impossible!

206
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,460
Liushang.

207
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:22,240
Liushang, you can't die.

208
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,360
Liushang.

209
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,320
Liushang!

210
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,320
It's me?

211
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,480
I killed them?

212
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,640
I killed them.

213
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,790
Stop pretending!

214
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,150
Did Yuechu send you here

215
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,630
to kill everyone?

216
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,720
I'm sorry.

217
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,150
Sorry?

218
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,280
What's the use of apologizing?

219
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,800
Can you bring these innocent victims back to life?

220
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,340
Will it atone for you ruining the alliances' cooperation?

221
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,870
No matter what,

222
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,230
I must make you pay with your life.

223
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,270
It's my fault.

224
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,570
I can't cause any more trouble for Yuechu.

225
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,260
So...

226
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,310
I don't need your help with it.

227
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:27,870
No!

228
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,120
Fu Cheng!

229
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,720
Dongfang Yuechu.

230
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,130
See?

231
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,610
Tushan forced Fu Cheng to death.

232
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:08,900
Got the news so soon?

233
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:11,819
Elder's death and today's matter

234
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,680
must be settled.

235
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,319
She hates you

236
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,440
for killing Elder

237
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,579
and for bringing humans to Tushan.

238
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,160
For today's matter,

239
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:28,569
Fu Cheng has died.

240
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,270
As for Elder's death,

241
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,160
I'll take the blame.

242
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,720
So you want Tushan

243
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,680
to take the blame for Fu Cheng's death?

244
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,920
Tushan Honghong.

245
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:11,310
You'll never catch the Black Foxes.

246
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,880
Fox spirits respect the strong.

247
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,590
Only by absorbing hatred

248
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,990
and letting it spread all over your meridians

249
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,890
can you force the Black Foxes driven by hatred

250
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,960
to appear.

251
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,350
But Honghong,

252
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,240
do you dare?

253
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,730
Or

254
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,760
do you doubt that the love in your body

255
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,780
can overcome hatred?

256
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:52,750
Chief.

257
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:58,570
Are the preparations for Liushang's funeral settled?

258
00:18:59,110 --> 00:18:59,840
Don't worry.

259
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,290
Rongrong's taken care of everything.

260
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,110
But these successive incidents

261
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,280
are obviously the Black Foxes

262
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,680
trying to sow discord between the Spirit and Yiqi Alliances.

263
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:15,240
You seem to be in a bad mood.

264
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,250
Did something happen?

265
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,060
Do you know

266
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,220
how Black Foxes enter the circle?

267
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,910
Could it be...

268
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,960
Right here.

269
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,920
Grief Tree's roots link to the outside.

270
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,440
In that case,

271
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,110
they destroyed the Heaven Sect Pass

272
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,200
as a cover-up.

273
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,000
The real passage to enter the circle

274
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,750
is here?

275
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:06,880
Yes.

276
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,640
When I returned to Tushan that day,

277
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,100
I followed a Black Fox I saw

278
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,930
with my spiritual consciousness into the roots.

279
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,810
Outside the circle,

280
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,880
there's a Black Grief Tree.

281
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,070
Black Grief Tree?

282
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,800
Black Grief Tree absorbs hatred.

283
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,570
The greater the hatred,

284
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,350
the stronger it becomes.

285
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:29,640
That's why Black Foxes can control others' emotions

286
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,960
and arouse hatred.

287
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:33,550
If that's the case,

288
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,170
why did you force Yuechu to leave?

289
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,810
Tear of Void is cultivated with vitality.

290
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,030
I see.

291
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,650
You don't want Yuechu to sacrifice himself

292
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:48,980
to form the Tear of Void,

293
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,000
so you forced him to cut ties with Tushan.

294
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,550
But without this tear,

295
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,850
how can we deal with those Black Foxes?

296
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,520
Fox spirits respect the strong.

297
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,300
If I absorb enough hatred,

298
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,540
I can control the Black Foxes.

299
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,570
But in this way,

300
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,560
you'll be dominated by hatred.

301
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,290
You won't just fail to destroy Black Foxes

302
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:10,460
but also become their helper.

303
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,520
It doesn't matter.

304
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,680
I have my own plan.

305
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,080
When this matter is over,

306
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,670
please give

307
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,100
this spiritual butterfly to Yaya and Rongrong.

308
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,110
Thank you.

309
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:28,850
What about Yuechu?

310
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,220
He won't agree if he knows about this.

311
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,610
So don't let him know.

312
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:41,450
[Divine Flame Villa]

313
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,790
I know

314
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,850
that if you were me,

315
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,930
you'd have done the same.

316
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,440
I'm sorry.

317
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:07,050
I won't make it

318
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,810
to our promised future.

319
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,010
Only two died

320
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:21,210
and Honghong and Yuechu have fallen out.

321
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,430
At this rate,

322
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,040
before the month's over,

323
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:30,640
the entire Tushan and the six realms will be mine.

324
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,270
Yours?

325
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,850
I mean Black Fox Empress', of course.

326
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,920
What should we do next?

327
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,560
Honghong has entered the game.

328
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,250
We just need to win over Yuechu

329
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,960
as we planned.

330
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,440
Wait.

331
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,310
Why did you stop me?

332
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,940
Don't rush to kill them here.

333
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,830
What do you mean?

334
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,390
If

335
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,770
Yueti Chun

336
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:19,110
knew her daughter died in Tushan,

337
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,160
what would happen?

338
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,470
Can we really fall in love here?

339
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,790
Trust me.

340
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,570
Tushan is where all spirits get attached.

341
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:41,970
Grief Tree can help humans and spirits fall in love.

342
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,720
If we pray sincerely

343
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,740
under Grief Tree,

344
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,740
you'll truly fall in love with me.

345
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,230
Then...

346
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:52,930
What about you?

347
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,390
Me?

348
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,590
Don't you already...

349
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,230
know how I feel for you?

350
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,360
Here are the noodles.

351
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,440
Be careful.

352
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:23,200
Here.

353
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,480
Eat up.

354
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:27,580
I'm sorry.

355
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,820
I usually entertain customers who drink wine.

356
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,280
I only have simple dishes.

357
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,620
It's not simple.

358
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:33,780
No shops are open now.

359
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,710
I'm grateful for something to eat.

360
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,770
Wait!

361
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,460
Noodles taste good

362
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,440
when they're thoroughly mixed.

363
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:47,600
Besides, you always scarf down your food.

364
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,880
Don't burn yourself.

365
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,510
This fool

366
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,840
is quite considerate.

367
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:57,720
Done.

368
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,240
By the way,

369
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,300
did you pester me

370
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,530
because of the Seven-Treasures Bark?

371
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,680
Calm down.

372
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,310
I mean,

373
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,920
I thought you seized this magic tool.

374
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:20,750
But you kept nagging along the way,

375
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,120
saying that once you get it,

376
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:24,680
you'd go back to see your mother.

377
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,480
That means you don't have it.

378
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,160
So...

379
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:30,210
you came to me for that,

380
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:30,790
right?

381
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,720
No?

382
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,120
That's right then.

383
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,700
Neither you nor I

384
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,670
nor the Ximens

385
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,690
have it.

386
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:39,440
It means

387
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,540
someone else

388
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:42,860
stole it!

389
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:43,620
Right?

390
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,400
Who could've stolen it?

391
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,830
Actually,

392
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,790
I did come to you

393
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:56,850
to find the magic tool.

394
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:58,640
But...

395
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,400
But...

396
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:04,310
I became attracted to you later.

397
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:15,950
Why are you

398
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:17,500
bringing this up suddenly?

399
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,400
Nothing.

400
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,850
I was thinking about it

401
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,030
and figured it out.

402
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:26,670
Eat your noodles.

403
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:36,700
Come in!

404
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,240
A human?

405
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,070
How dare you!

406
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,200
How dare you come to our turf?

407
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,270
Sirs...

408
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,240
Well... Sirs...

409
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,160
Well...

410
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,880
The human and spirit alliances are working together.

411
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,180
Why can't I come here?

412
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:51,830
That's right.

413
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,550
Kid,

414
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,680
what you said is in the past.

415
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,480
Now your director

416
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,120
has killed Tushan spirits.

417
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,550
We're sworn enemies!

418
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,480
Calm down, sirs.

419
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,070
Calm down!

420
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,240
Wait, wait, wait!

421
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,000
Calm down.

422
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,100
You...

423
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,680
Does everyone in Tushan listen to Chief?

424
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,400
Yes, yes, yes.

425
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,710
Listen to Chief.

426
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,670
Of course.

427
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,510
Then

428
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:13,930
did Chief say

429
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,720
humans can’t come here?

430
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,160
No, she didn't.

431
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,350
Right? I'm sure.

432
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,380
Did Chief say

433
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,850
humans and spirits can bond under Grief Tree?

434
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:26,050
It's a good thing, isn't it?

435
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,680
It's a good thing.

436
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,220
To kill him,

437
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:33,300
you've to get my permission first.

438
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,590
Sirs!

439
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,120
Chief's ordered

440
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,480
-not to stir up trouble.
-But we can’t spare him!

441
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,500
Don’t hurt humans.

442
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,870
Let's obey Chief, okay?

443
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:45,270
I’ll give you some good wine for free.

444
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:47,200
How can we let him off lightly?

445
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,010
Spare him for my sake.

446
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:49,410
I'll spare you this time!

447
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,190
Come to my little tavern next time!

448
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,490
Haven't you always been afraid of spirits?

449
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:03,260
How were you so bold just now?

450
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:05,720
Was I?

451
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,670
I think

452
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,880
since you've been protecting me,

453
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:16,100
I should try to protect you too.

454
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:18,750
Besides,

455
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,040
you're a spirit.

456
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,600
Since I chose to be with you,

457
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:23,760
then...

458
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,440
I should know these spirits

459
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,150
and integrate socially.

460
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,900
After thinking for so long,

461
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,300
have you gained clarity?

462
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:13,930
Don't be anxious.

463
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,740
I'm here to help you clarify things.

464
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,030
Do you know

465
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:22,570
why Honghong took you in in the first place?

466
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:26,830
Do you really think she sympathizes with the weak?

467
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:31,890
There are so many human orphans who lost their parents.

468
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,870
Why did she only take you in?

469
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,760
Because Dongfang Blood can be sacrificed to Grief Tree

470
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,520
to stop the invasion of hatred.

471
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,260
Nonsense!

472
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,480
Of course you don't believe it.

473
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Do you remember Tushan Buzui

474
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,730
setting up a trap to kill you?

475
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,450
He could have killed the Dongfangs long ago.

476
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:55,960
Why did he wait for you to enter Tushan?

477
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,590
In that case,

478
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:00,350
why did Honghong save me from Elder?

479
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,340
Because she still

480
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,860
needs to use you for a greater cause.

481
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,510
Without you,

482
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,060
how could she gain the humans' trust?

483
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:11,350
Without you,

484
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:14,770
how could she enter the humans' territory

485
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,080
and deal with Jin Renfeng and me?

486
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,450
Do you think I'll believe you?

487
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,170
Honghong loves me.

488
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:23,920
Yes.

489
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:25,830
She loves you.

490
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,070
But even this love

491
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,790
was designed by her.

492
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:32,720
Because falling in love

493
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
boosts a spirit's emotional power.

494
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,070
She was also

495
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:38,810
inspired by Bu Tai and Shi Kuan's love,

496
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:42,400
when she found that human-spirit bonds produce more power.

497
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:46,030
So she fell in love with you, an infatuated human,

498
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,610
to become stronger to compete with me.

499
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:49,930
Anyway,

500
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,930
you have always been

501
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:54,550
just a tool to her.

502
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:56,570
Still not convinced?

503
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:57,830
Fine.

504
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,800
I'll ask you one more thing.

505
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,750
Did she tell you

506
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:04,470
you'll exhaust your vitality

507
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,870
to cultivate the Tear of Void?

508
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,080
I've studied Emptiness Magic repeatedly.

509
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:12,280
[Emptiness Magic]

510
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,480
There's no problem

511
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,790
with the methods in here.

512
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,520
You can continue cultivating.

513
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,800
She didn't tell you, right?

514
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,010
She only cares about Tushan.

515
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,550
Even if you gave her your heart,

516
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,410
to her,

517
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,280
you're just an expendable human.

518
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,220
Protecting Tushan

519
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,200
isn't just a duty to me.

520
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:42,240
There are so many hardworking spirits here.

521
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,350
All the memories

522
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,970
in this land

523
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,680
are inseparable from my life.

524
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,530
I'm protecting it willingly at all costs.

525
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,490
Check it and you'll know if it's true or not.

526
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,950
I won't say more.

527
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,920
The truth hurts,

528
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,350
but it will...

529
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,070
wake you up.

530
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:51,610
Tushan Honghong.

531
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,830
Have you made up your mind?

532
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,890
Even if I absorb hatred,

533
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,130
I'll never forget my original intention

534
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:59,530
and be blinded by hatred.

535
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,720
In this world,

536
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:05,110
who can live without suffering and hatred?

537
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,220
But even if there's endless hatred,

538
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,450
as long as there's a ray of love,

539
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,670
darkness and coldness can be dispelled.

540
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,150
Hatred

541
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,400
can never overcome love!

542
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:23,780
Let's wait and see then.
