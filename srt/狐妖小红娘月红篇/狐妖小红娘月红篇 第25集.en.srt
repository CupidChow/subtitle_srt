[Episode 25]

4
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,470
Where did this spiritual butterfly come from?

5
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,900
Yan Rushan has escaped.

6
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,930
He got the map.

7
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,229
It's Chi Lei.

8
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:12,680
Liushang.

9
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,030
Wait here with Dongfang Luo.

10
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,430
Yes.

11
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,170
Be careful.

12
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,190
Chi Lei, you've done so many evil things!

13
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,240
I must arrest you today!

14
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,790
Spirit-subduing Net!

15
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,500
The Spirit-subduing Net is a powerful tool against spirits.

16
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,300
But only if you can hit me with it!

17
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,960
Otherwise, it's just

18
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,400
a small trick.

19
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,910
You think you can arrest me?

20
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,310
Dream on!

21
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,960
Yan Rushan...

22
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,390
Constable Lyu, are you alright?

23
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,000
The terrain here is too complicated.

24
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,620
I spent a long time finding my way

25
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,940
and came back late.

26
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,860
I'm sorry.

27
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,730
Who would have thought

28
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,360
that the man of Thousand-Faces,

29
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,090
the woman abductor Yan Rushan,

30
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,960
was actually an ugly bull spirit?

31
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,800
What a pity.

32
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,410
If those beautiful girls

33
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,420
knew how ugly you actually are,

34
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,400
they would wish for death.

35
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,370
Don't mind what he said.

36
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,750
Whether it's human or spirit,

37
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,279
no one can choose one's appearance.

38
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,000
Appearance doesn't represent anything either.

39
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,160
Inner good and evil

40
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,730
are the true beauty and ugliness.

41
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,420
Thank you for protecting me earlier.

42
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,480
Now,

43
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,250
it's my turn to protect you.

44
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,270
Since you're back for death,

45
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,350
let me grant your wish.

46
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,330
I was born in Kongxian Mountain

47
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,090
and grew up surrounded by lava.

48
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:47,730
Your flame

49
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,040
won't hurt me!

50
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,300
Really?

51
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,610
He was already no match for Chi Lei.

52
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,960
Now, the Tears of the Sea

53
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,870
has taken away half his power.

54
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,170
Fighting Chi Lei

55
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,520
will only kill him.

56
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,590
So, why did he come back?

57
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,500
Is he

58
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,070
using the last of his strength

59
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,590
to fight against

60
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,610
Chi Lei the Fire Dragon for me?

61
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:25,990
Oh no.

62
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,430
Yan Rushan is holding

63
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,360
the burning Spirit-subduing Net.

64
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,240
The Net is a sacred weapon for capturing spirits.

65
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,210
Even touching the Spirit-subduing Net

66
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,800
will hurt the spirit tremendously.

67
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
Is this guy...

68
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,040
planning to sacrifice himself?

69
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,480
Yan Rushan!

70
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,010
No!

71
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,990
I didn't kill Chi Shan.

72
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,460
Return to Huntian Prison immediately.

73
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,260
I will find out the truth for you.

74
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,940
I won't fall for your lies!

75
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,790
Everyone in the six realms knows

76
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:28,760
only you

77
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,090
can use the Claw of Insulation.

78
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,470
Don't make the wrong decision again and be used by others.

79
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,560
Cut the crap!

80
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,320
He's badly injured.

81
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,350
Please take him to heal up, Constable Lyu.

82
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,040
Thank you for the reminder.

83
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,710
I'll let him heal up.

84
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,440
But before that,

85
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,280
I need to put this on him.

86
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,000
Yan Rushan.

87
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,390
Do you see it now?

88
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,040
Humans are ruthless like that.

89
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,310
You'd better join me and kill...

90
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:25,510
Yan Rushan!

91
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,030
I'll bear the mistakes

92
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:34,440
I've made.

93
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,090
You can't arrest me

94
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,180
with that item in your hand.

95
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,370
Only by doing this

96
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,920
will I be paralyzed.

97
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,660
So in your heart,

98
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,000
I'll always be

99
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,460
a criminal.

100
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,030
Move it.

101
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,480
Hurry up.

102
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,350
What are you looking at?

103
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,830
You... move it.

104
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,130
Go.

105
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,150
Hurry!

106
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,270
All members of the Chi Sha Bandits

107
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,400
have been arrested.

108
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,050
You can go back and report to your higher-ups too.

109
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,920
You're right.

110
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,320
Yuechu.

111
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,500
It's getting late.

112
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,840
Honghong asked me to inform you and Constable Lyu

113
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,970
to leave the valley.

114
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:50,790
Okay.

115
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,180
This is...

116
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,110
A friend of mine.

117
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,920
Since he's your friend,

118
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,360
he is also my friend.

119
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,800
I'm Lyu Jianwen.

120
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,480
Nice to meet you.

121
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,050
I'm Dongfang Luo. Nice to meet you.

122
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,460
Luo, you're such a people person.

123
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,540
You can make friends wherever you go.

124
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,400
Alright.

125
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,830
I'll be out soon.

126
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:20,660
You go first.

127
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,040
Okay.

128
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,880
Did you notice something wrong?

129
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,080
I smelled the scent

130
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,690
of Chi Shan's blood on him.

131
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,400
He was there when Chi Shan died.

132
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,630
It's not impossible

133
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,430
to smell his blood on him.

134
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,090
I checked Chi Shan's body.

135
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,870
Unless he touched Chi Shan's blood,

136
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,070
the smell shouldn't have

137
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,370
remained on him for more than a day.

138
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,400
Are you sure?

139
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:56,040
Yes.

140
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,320
But Chi Shan was killed by the Claw of Insulation.

141
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,650
How do you explain that?

142
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,420
It was an imitation.

143
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,710
The real Claw of Insulation

144
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:07,390
uses strong spirit power to tear the target apart without physical contact.

145
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,450
Only the wound caused by an imitation

146
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,540
would leave the scent of blood on the attacker's hands.

147
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,540
Don't tell anyone about this for now.

148
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,950
Don't act rashly either.

149
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,590
Is something the matter?

150
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,090
Everything is fine.

151
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,370
But it went too smoothly.

152
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,720
Are you worried that he has a backup plan?

153
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,450
Do you remember that nobleman?

154
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,610
I hope I'm just overthinking.

155
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,100
Let's leave this place first.

156
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:53,840
Honghong.

157
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:58,720
Nothing.

158
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,840
Come to me.

159
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,520
Coming.

160
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,100
Darned woman.

161
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,430
Luo, you did a good job this time.

162
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,350
You didn't hold Honghong back.

163
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,040
It's all thanks to your support, Yuechu,

164
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,700
that I managed to safely complete this mission.

165
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,260
Don't worry.

166
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,640
I'll continue to take good care of you.

167
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,320
What are you doing?

168
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:01,980
Don't move!

169
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:04,280
Let go!

170
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,020
Stay still!

171
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,750
Let go of me!

172
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,060
Don't move!

173
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:07,750
Let go of me!

174
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,650
Let's get out of the valley first.

175
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,530
Something doesn't feel right.

176
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:49,990
Best to check ahead first.

177
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,450
It's the Dark Force...

178
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,360
Everyone, leave the valley first.

179
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,080
Honghong!

180
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:04,890
Let's go.

181
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,030
Go.

182
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:07,970
Let's go.

183
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,480
Follow the plan.

184
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,360
We can't let Tushan Honghong escape.

185
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:20,640
Don't worry.

186
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,100
Even if I have to risk my life,

187
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,450
I won't let Tushan Honghong go.

188
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,270
Honghong!

189
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,970
Something is absorbing my power.

190
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,470
They are using the formation to release Shi Ji.

191
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,080
Chi Lei!

192
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,360
Chi Shan didn't die from the Claw of Insulation!

193
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,200
The Claw of Insulation tears open wounds without physical contact.

194
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,460
But Chi Shan's wound was scratched open!

195
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,480
Someone killed Chi Shan on purpose

196
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,030
and put the blame on Honghong

197
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,490
to pit you against Tushan!

198
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,470
Chi Lei.

199
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,720
Do not let the deceitful words of

200
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,650
this vile human disturb your mind.

201
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,750
Tushan Honghong.

202
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,790
This time, I'll let you fall into darkness forever

203
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,940
and never be able to escape.

204
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,480
Chi Lei, think about it.

205
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,550
Who instigated Chi Shan

206
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,890
to go to the Spirit Market?

207
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,270
Who transported his body

208
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,200
all the way here?

209
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,350
Don't you get it?

210
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,160
From helping you escape prison

211
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,360
to setting up the formation now...

212
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,590
Everything was planned

213
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,780
to use you

214
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:53,830
to trap Honghong!

215
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:12,790
Chi Lei.

216
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,270
Dongfang Yuechu is cunning.

217
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,770
Don't fall for his lies!

218
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,900
Kick him out of the formation!

219
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,090
Chi Lei.

220
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,980
Apart from Xue Zang,

221
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,550
only you

222
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,750
knew that Chi Shan had been to Fire Dragon Valley.

223
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,660
You tricked him into going to the Spirit Market!

224
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,870
Don't be fooled.

225
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,230
Guard the formation!

226
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,160
Chi Lei!

227
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,640
Capture this woman!

228
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,160
She's the key to Chi Shan's death!

229
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:07,660
You think too highly of him.

230
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:15,570
You've been setting me up!

231
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,900
Because I didn't cooperate,

232
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:18,800
you...

233
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,650
you killed Chi Shan!

234
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,240
Since you're such close siblings,

235
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:26,400
why don't you accompany him in the afterlife?

236
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,400
I said I would avenge Chi Shan!

237
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,750
None of you

238
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,160
can escape today!

239
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,200
This is bad.

240
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:43,630
He's going to sacrifice himself while killing us.

241
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,170
I'm sorry.

242
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:49,610
I failed to protect you, my brother.

243
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,040
Dongfang Yuechu!

244
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,830
I'll give you a fighting chance!

245
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,480
Avenge me!

246
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,890
♫The falling leaves♫

247
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,650
♫Land on autumn grass♫

248
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:41,900
♫Who knocked on my heart again♫

249
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,610
♫I look back a thousand times♫

250
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,650
♫At the most unbearable sincerity♫

251
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,780
♫Waiting for you to ask♫

252
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,810
♫Let the warmth linger even for a moment♫

253
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:59,240
♫My yearning descends from the sky♫

254
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,460
♫Turning into countless whispers♫

255
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:08,380
♫I wipe away your tears with a piece of night sky♫

256
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:12,260
♫The past is always the same♫

257
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,790
♫I've heard of the jokes in the streets♫

258
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:22,200
♫How deep can this love carve into the wood♫

259
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:25,450
♫The red leaves set us ablaze♫

260
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,720
♫The snow drains our warmth♫

261
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,930
♫We keep parting and loving each other again♫

262
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:34,930
♫Living life like a dream♫

263
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:38,700
♫My heart and mind are always conflicting♫

264
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,530
♫I have passed by so many people♫

265
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,350
♫All that is left♫

266
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:49,450
♫Is my reflection in your eyes♫

267
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,480
I'm glad you're fine.

268
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,750
Unfortunately,

269
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,820
they used Chi Lei.

270
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:21,600
He only found out the truth before he died.

271
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,660
You're badly injured.

272
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,680
How do you feel?

273
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:32,990
Honghong.

274
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:34,510
Let go of me.

275
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,440
I thought you were badly injured

276
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,500
and needed my care.

277
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,910
It seems that I thought wrong.

278
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,230
My head hurts.

279
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,690
I feel dizzy.

280
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,360
My vision is blurry.

281
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,090
Since you're so badly injured,

282
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,640
you likely won't be able

283
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,100
to do anything for a while.

284
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,000
How about I find a way out of the valley

285
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,660
and fetch someone to save you?

286
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,710
Don't go.

287
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,020
Why?

288
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,000
I'm scared.

289
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,200
Please don't go.

290
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,640
Don't leave me here alone.

291
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:18,920
Let go of me first.

292
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,550
No.

293
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,380
If you don't let go now,

294
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,010
the porridge will be burnt.

295
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,670
You lied to me.

296
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:41,750
So what?

297
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,340
Fine.

298
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,910
As long as you're happy.

299
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,680
You can fool me

300
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:49,970
as you wish.

301
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:11,380
My hands are weak.

302
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:12,280
I can't hold it.

303
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,150
Then starve.

304
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,810
Hey, I saved your life.

305
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,290
If word gets out that

306
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,000
this is how the Chief of Tushan

307
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,880
treats her savior,

308
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,790
your reputation will be ruined.

309
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,880
My reputation has always been bad.

310
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,540
This won't make a difference.

311
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,480
You're right.

312
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,960
Even a three-year-old kid knows that

313
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,960
the Chief of Tushan is unreasonable

314
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,680
and very mean.

315
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,910
If a kid sees you,

316
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,270
he'd be too scared to cry.

317
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:56,880
I know you're angry.

318
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,680
Don't be angry.

319
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,880
It's bad for your health.

320
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:04,750
I...

321
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:07,640
I was just kidding.

322
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,440
Everyone knows

323
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,380
the Chief of Tushan is

324
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,000
cold on this outside but kindhearted.

325
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,800
Not only are you kindhearted...

326
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,160
Delicious.

327
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:34,380
This is the first time you cooked porridge for me.

328
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,700
Oh no.

329
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,650
Shi Ji ran away.

330
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,520
Something happened to Chief.

331
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,330
Sister...

332
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:07,940
Yaya!

333
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:11,640
Yaya!

334
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,270
Yaya.

335
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,160
Yaya!

336
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:15,880
Calm down.

337
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:18,010
Shi Ji's escape is a serious matter.

338
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:19,940
Let's assess the situation first.

339
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,760
It's a letter from my sister.

340
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,790
Dongfang Yuechu and I

341
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,350
are trapped in the Fire Dragon Valley.

342
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,640
Although we're stuck here for now,

343
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,660
we're safe.

344
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,940
Don't worry.

345
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,370
Tell Liushang and others to go back to Tushan for now.

346
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,120
I'm glad that they're fine.

347
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,030
But why are they

348
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:44,040
trapped in the Fire Dragon Valley?

349
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:44,920
No.

350
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,010
I have to save them.

351
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:46,710
Yaya.

352
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:49,590
Yaya, I know you're worried about your sister.

353
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,150
But to her right now,

354
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,440
it's more important for you

355
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,780
to stay here and safeguard Tushan

356
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,620
so she doesn't have to worry.

357
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:06,910
Honghong, don't go.

358
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,920
Don’t leave me alone.

359
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,690
The valley lacks medicine.

360
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,600
At this rate,

361
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,840
he won't last long.

362
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,820
I have to find a way out of here.

363
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,030
Since he's not a spy,

364
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,720
why does he still care so much about me?

365
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,410
Don't worry.

366
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,640
I will get you out of here.

367
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,390
An underground river?

368
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,820
If we follow this river,

369
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,150
we can leave the valley.

370
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:06,830
Hong...

371
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:13,570
What?

372
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,510
Are you disappointed to see me?

373
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:18,630
I dare not.

374
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:19,900
Greetings,

375
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,080
Spirit Lord.

376
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,690
At this point,

377
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,850
you still harbor feelings for Tushan Honghong.

378
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,890
Have you forgotten that I woke you up with my power?

379
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,970
I was wrong.

380
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,470
Please spare my life.

381
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,800
Remember,

382
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:44,860
once your identity is exposed,

383
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,700
Tushan Honghong will be the first person to want you dead.

384
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,450
Understood.

385
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,830
Where are the people of Yiqi Alliance?

386
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,720
I was afraid they would find something amiss.

387
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,520
So I told

388
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,750
Lyu Jianwen to send

389
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:58,830
Yan Rushan and the others back first.

390
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,090
In the past few days,

391
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:02,640
you updated me on Tushan matters

392
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,960
and helped White Fox

393
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,990
lure Tushan Honghong into the trap.

394
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:08,880
You did a good job.

395
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,620
Thank you for your compliment, Spirit Lord.

396
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,920
Spirit Lord, you seem

397
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:19,920
badly injured.

398
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,110
Did something unexpected

399
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,350
happen in the valley?

400
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:26,510
We could have killed Tushan Honghong on the spot.

401
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:28,830
But I didn't expect Dongfang Yuechu

402
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,630
to risk his life and protect her.

403
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,500
Yuechu has always prioritized Honghong

404
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,480
over his own life.

405
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,570
It sounds like

406
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,510
you envy him.

407
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,740
It's really enviable to be able to

408
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,690
love someone like that.

409
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,960
But I know that

410
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,120
I've lost that right

411
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,390
in this lifetime.

412
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,310
I'm glad you understand.

413
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:59,200
With her intelligence and wisdom,

414
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:01,800
the Fire Dragon Valley won't trap her for long.

415
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,100
Remain by her side

416
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,510
and follow my orders.

417
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:06,480
Yes.

418
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:17,260
They're out.

419
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,480
Honghong!

420
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:29,730
Honghong.

421
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:30,920
How are you?

422
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,270
I'm fine.

423
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,480
But Yuechu is badly injured.

424
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,110
We need to take him back to Tushan as soon as possible.

425
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,550
If we're taking him to Tushan,

426
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:40,130
should we inform the Divine Flame Villa first?

427
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:40,890
Luo,

428
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:45,010
you don't seem to welcome me back to Tushan.

429
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,820
Don't say that.

430
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,330
Yuechu and I are both humans,

431
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:50,680
and we get along well.

432
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,310
With you,

433
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,590
I'll have more people to talk to.

434
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:55,910
In that case,

435
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,280
let's go back to Tushan first

436
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,670
before informing the villa.

437
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,260
[Zhizheng Hall]

438
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:10,770
What a feast.

439
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:13,060
Is this my last meal?

440
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,290
What are you talking about?

441
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,990
Your case has yet to be judged.

442
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,040
Why would this be your last meal?

443
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,800
Boss specially told us

444
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,440
to feed you well.

445
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,130
Lyu Jianwen?

446
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,920
Our boss

447
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,200
has been very busy recently.

448
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,030
She made a great contribution this time.

449
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:33,110
The Director specially promoted her to the next rank.

450
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,430
Talk about prestige!

451
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,510
Well,

452
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,310
will your boss

453
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,140
still be working here?

454
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,610
Even if she wants to,

455
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,210
she needs to find the time.

456
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,400
Recently,

457
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,510
our boss has been busy

458
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,970
dealing with blind dates.

459
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,920
Blind dates?

460
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,510
You have no idea.

461
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:57,250
Since our boss was promoted,

462
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,460
matchmakers have been queuing up at her door

463
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,520
to propose marriage to her every day.

464
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,500
Has your boss

465
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,820
taken a liking to anyone?

466
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,400
I don't know.

467
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:10,800
However,

468
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,679
among all the handsome young aristocrats,

469
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,440
there should be one or two

470
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:16,840
who are to her liking.

471
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:23,520
Don't worry.

472
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:24,300
Our boss will

473
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,350
be in charge of your case to the end.

474
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,199
By then,

475
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:29,860
she will personally escort you to the Huntian Prison.

476
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,530
It'll be fine.
