Outside the shop,

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,060
so many human girls are coming and going,

00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,310
but he hasn't laid eyes on any of them.

There's indeed nothing special about those girls.

show me the best rouge here.

Look at this rouge, Misty Dawn.

23
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,680
It has a rich hue.

24
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,050
With it on,

25
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,160
you'll look dignified and demure.

perfect for the blossom makeup.

35
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,400
You're a very professional manager.

36
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,070
Then, which one of themâ€¦

37
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,620
I want them all!

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,130
You're so generous.

39
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,920
Surprisingly, that brat

40
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,930
has some business acumen.

41
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,510
By the way,

42
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,050
that girl is good.

43
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,140
She's generous with money

44
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,520
and very lively.

45
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,360
If Yuechu marries her,

46
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,420
he can definitely live a good life.

47
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:26,010
That woman is too frivolous with money.

48
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,270
I don't think she can keep her wealth.

49
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,120
It's just a few boxes of rouge.

50

53

Sir, how much is this?

54
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,450
A potential customer.

55
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,870
This rouge has the hue of early autumn.

56
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,190
What's it made of?

57
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,070
You have a good eye, miss.

58
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,680
This is made of roses.

59
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,829
Shall I try it for you?

60
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:54,850
Look at them!

61

62
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,900
elegant,

63
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,530
and well-mannered.

64
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,140
She's more than a match

65
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,250
for Yuechu.

66
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,220

68
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:08,840

69
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,400
Okay.

70

Look, look!

71
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,790
She's touching his hand.

72
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,560
Goodbye, miss.

73
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,820
Come again.

74
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,270
Brat.

75
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,350
Let me ask you.

76
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,850
Is there anything special

77
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,560
about the girl just now?

78
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,310
Special?

79
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,270
I mean,

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,600
something very special

81
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,600
and unique,

82
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:39,510
something

83
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,350
you can't forget about.

84
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,120
Yes.

85
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,230
What's it?

86
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,920
She's very generous.

87
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,640
Twenty taels of silver.

88
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:53,450
Yaya,

89
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,190
are you busy today?

90
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,020
No. Why?

91
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,930
Can you watch the store for me?

92
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,250
What about you?

93
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:00,870
Me?

94
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,360
I'll take Lady Fairy to check out the Human Market.

95
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:07,680
Wait.

96
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,430
You need to sell rouge to pay your debt!

97
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,360
That's 20 taels.

98
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,560
Plus the money I earned before,

99
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,430
I'm already out of debt.

100
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:12,960
Let's go.

101
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,800
Come on.

102
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,910
You just want to hang out

103
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,600
without me tagging along.

104
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,310
Bravo! Bravo!

105
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,500

106
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,150

107
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,390
let's go see the show.

108
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,090
Let's go.

109
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,170
Coming through.

110
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:22,890
Hurry up.

111
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:23,950
What's the play?

112
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,560
Hurry up.

113
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,430
Your puppeteers are dilly-dallying.

114
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,120
It's irritating.

115
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,560
Exactly.

116
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,600
I'll work them with you.

117
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,870
Great!

118
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,640

Do it!

120

Do it!

121
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,220
Great!

122
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,720
You're the chief of Tushan,

123
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,350
but you're also just a normal spirit.

124
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,940
You have blood, flesh, a heart, and feelings.

125
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,590
You may also get hurt.

126
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,120
You can also feel cold, hot, and lonely.

127
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,660
You're protecting everyone.

128
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,120
But who's protecting you?

129
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:13,840
In this world,

130
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,480
there's gotta be someone

131
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,820
who protects you like you protect Tushan.

132
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,020
Lady Fairy, are you alright?

133
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,500
Lady Fairy, don't go with him!

134
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,070
Lady Fairy,

135
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,390
this time,

136
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,540
we saw the sunset together in the Spirit-Master Kingdom.

137
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,750
Next time, let's go to see snow-capped mountains,

138
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,630
lush forests,

139
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:44,880
and the moonlit river.

140
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,990
There are many beautiful views in the world.

141
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,070
Let's watch them together,

142
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,620
shall we?

143
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,620
Lady Fairy,

144
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,280
I want to see seasons change with you,

145
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,720
to wander on green hills with you

146
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,720
in the moonlight.

147
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,510
Interesting.

148
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,400
Great.

149
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,720
Buddy,

150
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,390
you're apparently an amateur.

151
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:08,920
Yeah.

152
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,000
The best part about romantic love

153
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,730
is the pushing and pulling.

154
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,680
Right?

155
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,520
You can't rush things.

156
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,210
Yeah.

157
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,120
You're so inexperienced.

158
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,070
That old man said

159
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,640
I can't rush things.

160
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,789
Great!

161
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,360
Lady Fairy, hurry.

162
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,440
Sir.

163
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,720
Two bowls of glutinous rice balls.

164
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,120
Okay.

165
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,860
Have a seat first.

166
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,220
Okay.

167
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:45,870
Sit.

168
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,870
Your glutinous rice balls.

169
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Here's the money.

170
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:57,750
Thank you.

171
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,510
Lady Fairy,

172
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,750
I know you don't like human food.

173
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,870
But try this.

174
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,510
How is it?

175
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,360
Very sweet.

176
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,800
Tasty, right?

177
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,240
When I came to the market with my parents as a kid,

178
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,750
they'd always buy me rice balls.

179
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,540
Once,

180
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,630
Dad lost his wallet

181
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,810
and didn't buy me them.

182
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,310
I kept crying,

183
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,960
and Dad was scolded by Mom for a long while.

184
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,600
Your parents

185
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,680
must love each other deeply.

186
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,020
My dad was henpecked.

187
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,160
He was very afraid of my mom.

188
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,120
But when my mom was in danger,

189
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,960
nothing could daunt him.

190
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,200
Roasted chestnuts!

191
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,530
Lady Fairy, wait for me.

192
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:44,860
â™«When my gaze passes through the long nightâ™«

193
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,700
I'd like some.

194
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:42,880
Okay.

195
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,050
Sir, I'd like a serving.

196
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,080
Okay.

197
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:52,390
â™«The cold moonlight freezes your vowâ™«

198
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,020
Your roasted chestnuts.

199
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,440
Thank you.

200
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,460
â™«I've waited till the stars went outâ™«

201
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,630
Roasted chestnuts.

202
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,010
â™«Until the snowstorm rages onâ™«

203
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,730
They're also tasty.

204
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,910
I'll peel one for you.

205
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:07,490
â™«Previous destinies remain in our previous livesâ™«

206
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,600
Try it.

207
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,080
â™«Who can hear your breathâ™«

208
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,900
â™«As you pour out your thoughtsâ™«

209
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,530
â™«It's my longingâ™«

210
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,240
How is it?

211
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:18,500
â™«Who can hear your fingertipsâ™«

212
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,130
Tasty.

213
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,410
Like I said.

214
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:23,130
â™«It's passion that ringsâ™«

215
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,200
There's a lion dance over there.

216
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,070
Let's go watch it.

217
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,070
Let's go watch it.

218
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:27,510
â™«That's my heartstrings going roundâ™«

219
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:24,870
Lion dance!

220
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,630
Let's go.

221
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:27,670
Let's go watch it.

222
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,600
Let's go.

223
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:30,780
â™«Strumming out tearsâ™«

224
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,920
Great! Great!

225
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:37,160
â™«Flying past you in a flurryâ™«

226
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:41,140
â™«Listen, the wind is blowing, and it's raining lovesicknessâ™«

227
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,630
Bravo!

228
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,290
â™«As memories pour from the skyâ™«

229
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:48,780
Bravo!

230
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:48,020
â™«It's an inch of my life, an inch of my heartâ™«

231
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,470
â™«It's my unresolved woeâ™«

232
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,700
Bravo! Bravo!

233
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:53,800
â™«Listenâ™«

234
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,300
â™«The wind blows and makes my heart flutterâ™«

235
00:11:55,330 --> 00:12:00,330
â™«But it's using falling leaves to prepare for this life's partingâ™«

236
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,990
â™«Love and hate are related to youâ™«

237
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,990
I hope we can keep walking like this.

238
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,850
â™«Our meeting was not in vainâ™«

239
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,570
Put the bucket in the back.

240
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,270
Okay.

241
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:13,910
Sir,

242
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,010
is the boy with you?

243
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,450
Yes.

244
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,400
He's my grandson.

245
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,370
A very sweet boy.

246
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,240
He offered to help me.

247
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,520
Where's the rest of your family?

248
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:29,540
His parents

249
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,450
were killed by spirits.

250
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,820
Killed by spirits?

251
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,320
Spirit attacks are common.

252
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,560
My son and daughter-in-law

253
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,840
were unlucky

254
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,510
and ran into them.

255
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,550
That boy and I

256
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,950
only have each other now.

257
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:52,720
I didn't know

258
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:55,380
spirits inflicted such pain on humans.

259
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,240
Lady Fairy,

260
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,860
don't blame yourself.

261
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,910
With the Spirit Alliance in charge,

262
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,840
things will get better and better.

263
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,360
Your blood poison has worsened,

264
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,100
and you've lost the Divine Flame.

265
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,620
How dare you send a message to disturb me?

266
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,210
I mentioned Refined Spirit Cores in the message.

267
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,270
Have you brought one with you?

268
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:02,120
This is the last Refined Spirit Core in the world.

269
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,160
It can restore your Divine Flame to its peak state.

270
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,510
But I must remind you,

271
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,870
once you take this pill,

272
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:13,270
you need to replenish spiritual blood in time,

273
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,900
or your heart and lungs will give out,

274
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,030
and you'll become a cripple.

275
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:19,850
I can

276
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,830
relieve your pain for now.

277
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,440
Think it over.

278
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,790
Instead of living in hell like this,

279
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,720
I'd rather roll the dice.

280
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,640
Don't regret it.

281
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,030
[Wangquan Villa]

282
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:52,450
Director.

283
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,800
Have you found out who sent that message

284
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,440
when you were in Beishan?

285
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,070
No.

286
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:04,150
It seems that person doesn't want to be found,

287
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,120
so I didn't find anything.

288
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,510
However,

289
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,000
during the recent chaos at Beishan,

290
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,490
Tushan's chief took advantage of it to establish the Spirit Alliance.

291
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:17,410
It seems poised to compete with the Yiqi Alliance.

292
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,670
Over the years,

293
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,820
tension has been building

294
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,960
between humans and spirits.

295
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,910
But the spirits at Tushan

296
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,910
have stayed disciplined

297
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,700
and never hurt any humans.

298
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,850
Have your men keep an eye on them.

299
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,300
Don't act rashly.

300
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:41,960
Yes.

301
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,120
I'll handle this matter myself.

302
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,750
Rongrong.

303
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,910
Look, the window's been busted for ages.

304
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,310
Why hasn't it been fixed?

305
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,510
A lot of mosquitoes came in last night.

306
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,910
They almost ate me alive.

307
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,120
Look.

308
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,390
They're everywhere.

309
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,440
Of course I can have it fixed.

310
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,450
But you need to pay.

311
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,000
Rongrong, I'm begging you.

312
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,440
Can you put it on my tab?

313
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:22,870
No.

314
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:26,030
You left the shop unattended and came back,

315
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,120
causing Tushan to lose the money we put in.

316
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,720
I haven't even settled that score with you yet.

317
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,000
You're so stingy.

318
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,120
Can't you show a bit of humanity?

319
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,120
I'm a fox. How would I have humanity?

320
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,050
Besides,

321
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,510
didn't you get a bundle of firewood from the kitchen?

322
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,390
Light it to create smoke.

323
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,910
It can drive mosquitoes away.

324
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,390
Start a fire in this hot weather?

325
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,080
Do you want to roast me alive?

326
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,720
Rongrong.

327
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,290
Rongrong, I'm begging you.

328
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,130
Rongrong!

329
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,600
So stingy!

330
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,640
Lady Fairy.

331
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,880
Be careful. It's hot.

332
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,940
The porridge today

333
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,640
tastes different.

334
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,800
I can't hide anything from you.

335
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,160
There are lotus seeds and lily bulbs in it.

336
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,530
They help beat the heat.

337
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,070
What's wrong?

338
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,880
It's awful?

339
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,000
It's great.

340
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,000
Wow.

341
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:54,300
Lady Fairy, you were teasing me!

342
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,360
How have I never noticed

343
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,160
how naughty and cunning you are?

344
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,380
No wonder people call a sly person an old fox.

345
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,750
As the chief of Tushan,

346
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,570
you're the most cunning.

347
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,920
You're easy to fool,

348
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,360
which is not my fault.

349
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,240
No way!

350
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,660
It's written on your face.

351
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,780
Stop laughing.

352
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,020
We need to do something later.

353
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:19,960
What's it?

354
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,740
It's really fixed!

355
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,830
Lady Fairy, you're amazing.

356
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:30,850
Lady Fairy,

357
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,200
that's a boring book.

358
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,610
Let's go out for a walk.

359
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,140
Why are you so nervous?

360
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,680
I'm not nervous.

[The Book of Bonding]

362
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:40,790
Ladyâ€¦

363

Th-That's Liushang's book.

364
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,960
This

365
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,030
is Liushang's book?

366
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,750
Yes.

367
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,630
No.

368
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,290
Lady Fairy,

369
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,510
it's not what you think.

370
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,830
What am I thinking?

371
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,200
Just a book.

372
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,270
Nothing new to me.

373
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,010
The view from your mini pavilion

374
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,470
is quite good.

375
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,310
Actually,

376
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,950
I don't like you sending me to the Human Market.

377
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,240
I know.

378
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,370
I'm not stupid.

379
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,790
I know what Yaya and the others want.

380
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,570
But I just don't like it.

381
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,800
My heart is not an inn.

382
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,580
It's not open

383
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:30,620
to any woman.

384
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,790
Sorry.

385
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,590
I don't want your apology.

386
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,590
You like being Tushan's little sidekick, don't you?

387
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,720
Go on then.

388
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:53,850
I refuse.

389
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,130
First, I've grown up.

390
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,070
Second,

391
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,170
I'm able to protect you now.

392
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,310
Third,

393
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,700
I'm not a sidekick.

394
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,800
I'm your perfect match.

395
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,260
Knock it off.

396
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,640
Wait for me here.

397
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,680
Last winter,

398
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,270
I went to great lengths to preserve a bucket of ice pops,

399
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,310
thinking I could enjoy them in summer

400
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,750
to beat the heat.

401
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,050
Tushan Yaya!

402
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,350
You thief!

403
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,500
It's for me?

404
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:41,680
Try it.

405
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,450
It looks good.

406
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,830
There's osmanthus honey in it?

407
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:45,400
Yes.

408
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,170
Yuechu tried so hard to hide it,

409
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,510
so I knew it must be something great.

410
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,440
I guessed right.

411
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:54,110
Isn't it tastier than those sold at the market?

412
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:55,470
It's indeed tasty.

413
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,610
But there's no such thing as a free lunch.

414
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,000
Tell me.

415
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:03,200
You want something from me, don't you?

416
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,510
Well,

417
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,370
can you teach me

418
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,460
how to conjure things out of thin air?

419
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,920
It's not for my benefit.

420
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I want to teach it to the other foxes.

421

to teach you?

423
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,170
But that's an amazing skill.

424
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,100
Are you really going to teach them?

425
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:27,210
I think they need to become more powerful.

426
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:29,200
So I'll teach them

427
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,420
all the skills I have.

428
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,270
Not bad.

I want to ask you that too.

It's so late, yet you're still up.

report my whereabouts to you?

443
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,160
Chief, I don't mean to nag you,

444
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,550
but it's only been days since you took Yuechu to open a store

445
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,440
in the human world.

446
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,100
Why have you brought him back?

447
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,270
Have you forgotten everything I said?

Are you going to leave Tushan in the lurch?

How dare you doubt my devotion to Tushan?

450
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,440
Then, Chief, you must give me

451
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,750
an explanation today.

452
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,090
What kind of explanation do you want?

453
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,100
Chief,

454
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,430
set aside other things for now.

That she-devil has returned

456
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,310
and is determined to fight to the death with Tushan.

457

Moreover, he's a descendant of the Dongfang family.

461
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,440
Chief.

462
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,580
Have you forgotten

463
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,440
why you took him back to Tushan back then?

464
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,160
I remember

465
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,690
everything I should remember.

466
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,440
It's late.

467
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,200
Go back and rest if there's nothing else.

468

you've been very lonely these years.

00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,240
Yaya.

I gave you a watermelon in return, didn't I?

This is called barter.

I'll give it back.

Please teach me that move.

500
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:34,840
Give it back!

501
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,590
Fine. Here you are.

Fine, whatever you say.

506
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,110
Teach me now.

00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:44,830
No.

508
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:47,200
Please teach me, Yaya.

No.

510

520
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:13,350
but in fact, they're after spiritual blood.

521
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,510
Let them dream on for now.

522
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,570
After I use them to wipe out Tushan,

523
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,850
no one can take that boy away from me.

524
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,810
You didn't alert

525
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,210
the Wangquan family, did you?

526
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,420
Rest assured, Master.

527
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,040
Wangquan Hongye's relationship with the Dongfang family

528
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,110
is known to everyone.

529
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,850
Since those guys want spiritual blood,

530
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,380
they won't invite trouble.

531
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,040
Everything's fine with the Grief Tree.

532
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,160
It seems that Shi Ji has been quiet recently.

533
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,040
In the battle at Beishan,

534
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,020
she must have been badly wounded.

535
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,020
But she's been scheming for so long.

536
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,420
She won't easily give up.

537
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,830
You've looked into the force behind her.

538
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:08,250
Have you found anything?

539
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,160
I've checked the Nan Kingdom, Aolai, and Beishan

540
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,240
but didn't find any suspicious forces.

541
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,030
I'm still investigating.

542
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,470
The spies sent out by Tushan

543
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:20,200
failed to find her hideout too.

544
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,080
Looks like she's very careful this time.

545
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,600
You've been here for so long.

546
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,410
Any problems in your  homeland?

547
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,000
No.

548
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,790
At present, nothing is more important

549
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,250
than getting rid of Shi Ji.

550
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:42,830
Yaya is an innocent girl.

551
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,360
I don't want her to get hurt.

552
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,170
Don't worry, Chief.

553
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,790
I won't hurt Yaya.

554
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:51,240
Neither will I let anyone hurt her.

555
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,550
Tushan is not far from here.

556
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:08,880
I wonder if the rumor about the Dongfang boy

557
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,010
is true or not.

558
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,970
I heard Divine Flame Villa has taken action too.

559
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:13,970
It should be true.

560
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,210
After we catch that boy,

561
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,880
let's make him marry a dozen girls

562
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,400
to give birth to many Dongfang girls.

563
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,320
One

564
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,680
for each of us.

565
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,840
Silver butterflies!

566
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,840
Silver butterflies!

567
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,310
Retreat! Retreat!

568
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,590
Go hide in the woods!

569
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,670
Oh no, we're surrounded!

570
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,000
Watch out!

571
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,790
These butterflies are weird.

572
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,160
Stop slashing them.

573
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,310
Try to find cover.

574
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,640
Divine Flame?

575
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,070
Purest Sun Flame.

576
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,110
Thank you for saving us, Jin.

577
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:37,640
We were going to Tushan to kill evil spirits.

578
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,270
If you hadn't come to our rescue,

579
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:42,270
we would've been killed by those strange butterflies.

580
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:44,000
Silver butterflies are lethal.

581
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,830
Tushan often uses sorcery to conjure them.

582
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:48,310
The infected die instantly,

583
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,090
without exception.

584
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,920
Those spirits at Tushan

585
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,720
are so cruel and vicious.

586
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,390
When we get to Tushan,

587
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,510
we must kill as many spirits as we can!

588
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,030
Yes.

589
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:00,510
Kill those spirits!

590
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,440
Tushan is a treacherous place.

591
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,170
Why don't we take the trail and go there together?

592
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,540
That's exactly what we think.

593
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:10,350
We're grateful to have your help.

594
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,770
You're welcome.

595
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,110
Let's set off.

596
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,310
If we travel with him,

597
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,550
what about that Dongfang boy?

598
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:24,030
Jin Renfeng has a high level of cultivation.

599
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:24,960
With him around,

600
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,790
Tushan spirits can be distracted,

601
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:30,030
which will give us a chance to get that boy.

602
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,310
After we catch him,

603
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,830
getting his blood

604
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,260
will be easy as pie.

605
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,530
Let's go.

606
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,200
Master has used silver butterflies

607
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,830
to gain the trust of those sect leaders.

608
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:45,090
Destroy the remaining butterflies now.

609
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,320
What are you waiting for? Do it!

610
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,510
Brat, be careful!

611
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:48,640
Elder!

612
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,360
You almost burned my beard.

613
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,440
Sorry, Elder.

614
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,970
Just now, I heard

615
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,750
a beast passing by.

616
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:59,310
I was worried that it might hurt the foxes,

617
00:30:59,310 --> 00:30:59,830
so Iâ€¦

618
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,280
I almost hurt you by mistake.

619
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,670
-I'm so sorry.
-Wait.

620
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,200
Beast? What beast?

621
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,920
Didn't you hear that?

622
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:09,830
It kept grunting just now,

623
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:10,960
like a boar.

624
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,070
That sound was terrible.

625
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,510
I didn't hear any grunting.

626
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,200
Brat, stop talking nonsense.

627
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,070
Fine, fine.

628
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:16,960
You're right.

629
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,600
What can I do for you, Elder?

630
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,030
Dongfang Yuechu,

631
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,920
I'm warning you.

632
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,490
Stay away from Chief.

633
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:27,430
You're from the Dongfang family.

634
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,310
Tushanâ€¦

635
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:28,840
Stop.

636
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,070
Old fox,

637
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,720
I told you to stay out of this.

638
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,310
Lady Fairy, don't be so serious.

639
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,640
You may scare Jiaojiao.

640
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,990
Jiaojiao, leave.

641
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,000
Lady Fairy, why are you so angry?

642
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:56,170
You know what Elder Buzui is like.

643
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,310
He tried to kill you,

644
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,340
and now he's here warning you.

645
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:02,000
Don't you feel wronged?

646
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,860
Being scolded is better than being ignored.

647
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:07,920
Besides,

648
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,440
although he often scolds me,

649
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,030
I've stolen his wine many times.

650
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:13,090
So, in the end, he's lost more than me.

651
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:14,880
That's it?

652
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,040
He's a nagging old man,

653
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,520
but he just wants the best for Tushan.

654
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,030
I don't want you to have conflicts

655
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,350
with him because of me.

656
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:28,920
Recently,

657
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:31,470
your cultivation has improved a lot.

658
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,930
I want to elevate my Purest Sun Flame

659
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:36,530
to level 3 as soon as possible

660
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,510
so that I can make better magic tools

661
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,910
and send them to Shi Kuan.

662
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,720
Dongfang Yuechu,

663
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,270
please get prepared in advance

664
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,730
after getting my message.

665
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,920
Kill Jin Renfeng!

666
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,000
Bitch,

667
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,840
how dare you betray Master?

668
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,240
When we caught Dongfang Yuechu last time,

669
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,680
something felt off about you.

670
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,640
Today, I caught you red-handed.

671
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,910
I've been thinking about

672
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,030
who gave that brat

673
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,700
the Fire Candle that day.

674
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,200
It turns out to be you.

675
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:39,080
After being my blood bag for so many years,

676
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,350
you must hate my guts, don't you?

677
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:44,640
Kill me.

678
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:50,920
Kill you?

679
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,630
Isn't that too easy for you?

680
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:01,440
You want to tip that brat off, don't you?

681
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:04,200
That's what I want too.

682
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,070
Donâ€™t forget you're poisoned with Sorrowful Tears.

683
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:10,400
I have a thousand ways

684
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,710
to make you wish

685
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:15,150
you were dead.

686
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,150
Tushan fox spirits

687
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,710
are cruel and cunning.

688
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,980
We have to strike first.

689
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,800
I've set the bait.

690
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,889
Let's wait for them to bite it.

691
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:31,110
We're all at your disposal.

692
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:35,630
Divine Flame Villa has been planning this for a long time.

693
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:38,030
We've devised a formation to kill spirits.

694
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,290
Hundreds of years ago,

695
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,010
the Villa used the Red Lotus Formation

696
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,489
to greatly weaken Tushan.

697
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:45,100
Today, we'll use that formation again.

698
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,630
Divine Flame Villa's disciples

699
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,960
will set up the formation outside Tushan.

700
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,000
You'll stay in the formation with me

701
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,290
to fight the enemies.

702
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,840
With such cooperation,

703
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:57,490
we can definitely destroy Tushan with this formation.

704
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,810
Your Purest Sun Flame has improved again.

705
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,990
Without you practicing with me,

706
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:13,700
I wouldn't have made it.

707
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,590
Thank you,

708
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,120
Lady Fairy.

709
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:18,880
Honghong.

710
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,230
A lookout said

711
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:22,180
Jin Renfeng and the Yiqi Alliance's disciples

712
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,580
have gathered in the woods outside Tushan.

713
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,630
Meet you outside Tushan

714
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,760
at noon today.

715
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,320
It's about something important.

716
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,280
Love, Fu Cheng.

717
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:43,270
Fu Cheng asked to see me outside Tushan.

718
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:44,490
It's weird.

719
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,430
She's never been so friendly to me.

720
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:49,960
Why is this message so cheesy?

721
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,570
Love, Fu Cheng?

722
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:54,520
I'm afraid Fu Cheng is exposed,

723
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:57,760
and the one who sent this message is Jin Renfeng.

724
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,490
I'll go out to check things out.

725
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,290
Go find Lai to save Fu Cheng.

726
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,030
Tushan Honghong.

727
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,550
Dongfang Yuechu.

728
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:26,280
Today,

729
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,400
I'll in no way let you escape.

730
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:42,960
Jin Renfeng.

731
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:44,550
You did too many bad things.

732
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,550
You brought all this upon yourself.

733
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,930
You ruined my plan again and again.

734
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:51,280
I'll give you another chance today.

735
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:53,360
Hand over Dongfang Yuechu,

736
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:57,670
or I'll make you wish you had never been born!

737
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:01,510
That's my line.

738
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:15,090
Gentlemen, thank you for coming all the way here

739
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,400
to help me activate the formation.

740
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:28,000
Red Lotus Formation.
