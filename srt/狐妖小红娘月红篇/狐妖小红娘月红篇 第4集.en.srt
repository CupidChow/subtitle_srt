5
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,700
Cooking your own kind?

6
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,430
Your tastes are quite something.

7
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,510
Watch your words.

8
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,850
I'm roasting sheep.

9
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,740
They're unrelated with us goats.

10
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,780
What a difference.

11
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,520
Brat.

12
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,470
You volunteered,

13
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,270
so Honghong let you come help me.

14
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,920
But you're shopping instead.

15
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,360
I'm just shocked

16
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,490
by the scale of the matchmaking event.

17
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,400
It summoned all spirit clans.

18
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,030
I shouldn't have brought

19
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,460
an ignorant guy like you.

20
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,560
What a disgrace to Tushan.

21
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,700
The event occurs once every century,

22
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,870
but Yaya hates it the most.

23
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,840
Don't provoke her.

24
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,440
If you make her angry,

25
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,570
you have to spend money to please her.

26
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:48,900
Isn't this

27
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,120
the spirits' most anticipated festival?

28
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,630
Why does Yaya hate it?

29
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,960
How'd you feel about it

30
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,630
if you've never received a Feathered Flower

31
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,020
over centuries?

32
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,990
Is it funny, brat?

33
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,800
Yaya.

34
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,310
I have work to do. Bye.

35
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:15,760
Not a single one.

36
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,560
Why?

37
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,900
How does that human

38
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,510
live such a carefree and unruly life in Tushan?

39
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,680
Even the higher-ups like him.

40
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,750
Yuechu.

41
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,800
Here, my rent for this month.

42
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:42,800
Take it.

43
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,260
I almost forgot about you.

44
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,590
Good luck with your business.

45
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,240
Thanks.

46
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,240
Take care.

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,890
Even before the event's started,

48
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,920
so many spirits are shopping here.

49
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,650
When business is good,

50
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,490
these spirit merchants pay rent willingly.

51
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:00,980
Next one is...

52
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,590
You ambushed me last time

53
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,330
and now you're stalking me.

54
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,610
What do you want?

55
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,850
You're bullying me.

56
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,190
I’ll report you to Chief.

57
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,590
She asked me to watch you.

58
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,860
If you bully me, you're bullying her.

59
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,630
Lady Fairy sent you to follow me?

60
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:43,720
Yes.

61
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,920
How can Chief not guard against

62
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,540
a human like you living in Tushan?

63
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,370
Shut up!

64
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,450
Report me all you want.

65
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,990
Did you really tell him that?

66
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,270
Yes.

67
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,650
He should've known his place long ago.

68
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,070
To think he'd get so angry

69
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:05,620
and hit me so hard.

70
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,950
But it's fine that he hit me.

71
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,650
He even disrespected you.

72
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,230
How dare a human

73
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,550
be so arrogant and domineering?

74
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,770
Don't let him off this time.

75
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,680
Okay, I got it.

76
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,510
So...

77
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,070
That's all?

78
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,380
What else do you want?

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,720
At least teach him a lesson.

80
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,330
Are you teaching me how to be the chief?

81
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,630
No, I dare not.

82
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,690
Then why are you still here?

83
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,030
Yes.

84
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,370
I'll take my leave.

85
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:53,640
Did he take Guoguo's words to heart?

86
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,660
You're still the same,

87
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,090
hiding when you're troubled.

88
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,950
Are you angry?

89
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,830
Guoguo was hurt by humans, so he has a grudge.

90
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,950
I asked him to follow you

91
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,970
to show him the kindness and strengths of humans.

92
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,190
Do you think

93
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,380
you've done that for him?

94
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,630
I think...

95
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,670
I failed to.

96
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:54,659
Not only that,

97
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,790
but you even tease him often.

98
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,390
No.

99
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,560
S-Sometimes?

100
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,160
Sometimes.

101
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,050
Yes.

102
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,410
I admit it.

103
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,680
I bullied him.

104
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,510
I promise you.

105
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,130
I won't do this again, okay?

106
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:16,840
I swear.

107
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,110
Don't you want to join in the fun?

108
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,760
This event occurs once every century.

109
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,690
It's a shame to miss it.

110
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:50,800
Let's go.

111
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:53,890
You're leaving already?

112
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,740
Lady Fairy.

113
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,620
I'll keep you company from now on.

114
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,070
Have a look!

115
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,830
The newly-launched wine

116
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,720
is our treasured tipsy brew.

117
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,480
It's said that

118
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,950
if those in love drink it under the moon

119
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,070
until tipsy,

120
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,560
they'll get earnest love

121
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,020
and be protected by Tushan

122
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,140
such that they'll never be apart,

123
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,560
even when in a drunken dream.

124
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,810
This is not only the matchmaking wine

125
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,820
but is also from Chief's stash.

126
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:29,950
I want one.

127
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:30,600
Me too.

128
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,760
Isn’t that…

129
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:33,909
Isn't that Chief?

130
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:36,809
Chief!

131
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,650
Chief!

132
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,490
Chief!

133
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:42,010
Chief!

134
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:47,050
Chief!

135
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,130
Let’s go.

136
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,820
What about the fireworks?

137
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,480
No.

138
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,540
Follow me.

139
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,190
Why did you bring me here?

140
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,450
To watch the fireworks.

141
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,020
What are you doing?

142
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:10,060
Keep today's happiness in mind.

143
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,100
Lady Fairy.

144
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,840
Tushan's been matchmaking for millennia.

145
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,220
Are there

146
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,510
many love stories?

147
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,240
Of course.

148
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,200
Has there been a human-spirit relationship?

149
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,350
I mean...

150
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,320
humans and spirits don't get along,

151
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,450
but they interact.

152
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,510
As for love,

153
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,970
it's not entirely impossible, right?

154
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,480
Grief Tree's fulfilled countless bonds,

155
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,600
with many unique situations,

156
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,640
but none were between

157
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,120
human and spirit.

158
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,150
All these years

159
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,640
and not one?

160
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,510
Why?

161
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,570
It's simple.

162
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,300
After shapeshifting,

163
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,660
though spirits resemble humans,

164
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:12,740
our habits and customs are different.

165
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:14,720
Moreover,

166
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,510
humans and spirits have different lifespans.

167
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,360
Even if they fall in love,

168
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,520
they can't be together forever.

169
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:25,920
I see.

170
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,870
Lady Fairy.

171
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,080
Lady Fairy?

172
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,790
This event's packed with spirits.

173
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,670
Have you arranged everything?

174
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,640
Don't worry.

175
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,190
Everything's arranged.

176
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:51,190
I heard you went to the market with Yuechu

177
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,180
to watch fireworks.

178
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,290
It's the first time you've shown interest

179
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,210
in this event after so long.

180
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,480
If you wanted to broaden Yuechu's horizon,

181
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,320
he could've gone alone

182
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,340
or you could've let other little foxes go with him.

183
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,290
It's not worth it for you to waste your time

184
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,750
like this.

185
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,360
What's your point?

186
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,390
Honghong.

187
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,270
Fox spirits' power comes from love.

188
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,150
As the chief of Tushan,

189
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,850
your Love Seed is frozen in Love Zone.

190
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,300
It'll only sprout if you fall in love,

191
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,780
greatly boosting your power.

192
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,040
But...

193
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,440
Yuechu's a human after all.

194
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,780
He's not a suitable candidate.

195
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:36,820
Besides,

196
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,220
-you brought him back to Tushan for...
-Do you think

197
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,410
I'd still fall for someone

198
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,630
as Tushan's chief?

199
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,510
Honghong.

200
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,290
Say no more.

201
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:50,890
Go back early.

202
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,440
Yes.

203
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,180
[Love Zone]

204
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:48,600
Yuechu.

205
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:08,800
Lady Fairy.

206
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:12,660
You...

207
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,150
Humans and spirits have different lifespans.

208
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,840
Even if they fall in love,

209
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,550
they can't be together forever.

210
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,090
Why did I have such a ridiculous dream?

211
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:57,390
Honghong.

212
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,210
Fox spirits' power comes from love.

213
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,480
Your power will be greatly boosted

214
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,000
by falling in love.

215
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,180
Besides,

216
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,550
you brought him back to Tushan for...

217
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,440
Do you think

218
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,990
I'd still fall for someone

219
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,190
as Tushan's chief?

220
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,780
Lady Fairy.

221
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,080
I need your help

222
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,410
with something.

223
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:27,890
What is it?

224
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,360
The matchmaking event occurs once every century.

225
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,220
Since I'm lucky to come across it,

226
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,030
can I join in the fun

227
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,000
with you?

228
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,720
Of course.

229
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,920
But I have something to do.

230
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,970
Ask other foxes to guide you.

231
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,180
What are you busy with?

232
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,140
Grief Tree blesses

233
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,510
the spirits' with true love

234
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,920
with Feathered Flowers

235
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,460
while absorbing their love.

236
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,230
As Tushan's chief,

237
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,440
I must enter the tree's heart

238
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,330
to be the medium

239
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,560
to connect the Grief Tree with spirits outside.

240
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,430
You're entering Grief Tree's heart?

241
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,910
Yes.

242
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,790
How dare he spy on Divine Flame Villa?

243
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,840
I only spared him so as not to

244
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,320
alert anyone.

245
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,680
Don’t worry, Master.

246
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
If we complete Spirit Lord's mission tonight,

247
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,600
Tushan will suffer greatly.

248
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,270
Then

249
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,440
let alone that old fox,

250
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,840
we won't have any trouble killing Tushan Honghong.

251
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,560
The fifteenth blood moon begins tonight.

252
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:01,080
It's when both the spirits' powers

253
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,680
and nightmares are strongest.

254
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:04,720
Also,

255
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,920
dreamcatchers woven by resentment

256
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,819
will draw out the deepest nightmares.

257
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,910
When the inner demons merge,

258
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:15,550
she'll fall into an eternal nightmare.

259
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,420
[Tushan]

260
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,670
The centennial blood moon.

261
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,110
The rainwater that nourishes all things.

262
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,750
Grief Tree's power

263
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,550
will aid matchmaking.

264
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,570
Love emerges from the heart.

265
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:13,170
Feathered Flowers will land

266
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,650
wherever love is.

267
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,920
Dear Grief Tree.

268
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,590
Humans and spirits are different,

269
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,120
but true love is boundless.

270
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,140
If I'd really fallen in love with Lady Fairy,

271
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,500
please give me a Feathered Flower

272
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:33,790
to confirm it.

273
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,030
What happened?

274
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:53,890
What happened?

275
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,440
Where are the Feathered Flowers?

276
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,300
What happened?

277
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,680
Nothing?

278
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,830
No Feathered Flowers?

279
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,550
Right.

280
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,440
What happened?

281
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:02,790
What happened?

282
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,270
Did you get it?

283
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,030
Me neither.

284
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,720
No one got it?

285
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,640
What's wrong?

286
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,400
I know.

287
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,960
Me neither.

288
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,110
What happened?

289
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:11,960
That's right.

290
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,380
Spirit Lord prepared this Tushan spirit aura.

291
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,840
It can cover up human aura.

292
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,760
If we disguise as Tushan spirits,

293
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,350
we can enter.

294
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,850
Congratulations, Master.

295
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:47,180
The dream pearl's made.

296
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,550
Hurry up.

297
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:51,200
While Tushan Honghong's in a nightmare

298
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,590
and Tushan's in chaos,

299
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:55,050
inject Divine Flame into Grief Tree

300
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:58,180
to burn away the suppression system she's laid before

301
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:01,460
and let resentment haunt the tree again.

302
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,460
Then Spirit Lord can seize Grief Tree's power.

303
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,250
Yes.

304
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:08,960
What about Tushan Honghong and Dongfang Yuechu?

305
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:10,880
Use this chaos

306
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,920
to kill Tushan Honghong

307
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,250
and capture Dongfang Yuechu.

308
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,970
As for the remaining spirits,

309
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,950
kill as many

310
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,000
as you can.

311
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,270
Many spirits from outside

312
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,070
came a long way to seek love.

313
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,030
If they all die in Tushan,

314
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:28,400
then...

315
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,160
Then Tushan

316
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,300
will be the spirits' enemy.

317
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,250
As for me, with the spiritual blood,

318
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,210
and as a great contributor to Yiqi Alliance,

319
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,070
even Wangquan Hongye

320
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,030
can't do anything to me.

321
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,810
Isn't this Elder's spiritual butterfly?

322
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:57,350
Yaya!

323
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:10,090
Why is she leaving?

324
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,110
Huh?

325
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,720
Calm down!

326
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,550
Calm down.

327
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,470
Well...

328
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:22,100
The matchmaking event

329
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:23,430
takes time.

330
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:25,450
You need to be more sincere.

331
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:27,680
You...

332
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,100
Follow me.

333
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,440
Arms up!

334
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,450
Okay.

335
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:33,690
Listen to me...

336
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,180
Dry wood won't crack.

337
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,510
Dry wood won't crack.

338
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:40,880
I just intercepted Elder's spiritual butterfly.

339
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,920
He sent a message saying

340
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,160
it's Jin Renfeng's plot.

341
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,840
They might've already entered Tushan.

342
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,070
No wonder Honghong's so quiet inside the tree.

343
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,460
Isn't she in danger?

344
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:49,930
I need to find her.

345
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:50,860
I'll go with you.

346
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,000
You go first.

347
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,480
I'll stay to pacify everyone.

348
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:53,970
Okay.

349
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:54,680
Let's go.

350
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,400
Bonds form under Grief Tree

351
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,400
with Feathered Flowers as witnesses

352
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,720
and the lead of red threads.

353
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,880
Please make your own red threads

354
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,270
and wait for Feathered Flowers to fall.

355
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,060
Why are you late even for this?

356
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,190
Don't slander me.

357
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,000
There are too many spirits here

358
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,200
that I was pushed out.

359
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,570
It wasn't easy to get in.

360
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,270
Brat, let's go!

361
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,200
Lady Fairy!

362
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,160
Lady Fairy.

363
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,660
What happened?

364
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,070
Dreamcatcher?

365
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,010
Someone's plotting

366
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,120
to trap her in a dream with it.

367
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,500
Dreamcatcher?

368
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:48,590
That's right.

369
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:49,550
It can capture

370
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,680
and weave her deepest nightmares

371
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,350
into a dream and trap her in it.

372
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,220
The scariest thing is

373
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,670
the dangers in the dream are real.

374
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,960
Her primordial spirit

375
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,460
will be hurt accordingly.

376
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,940
If in the dream, she...

377
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,400
Anyway, we've to wake her up

378
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,450
or she'll be trapped forever.

379
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,510
How can we wake her up?

380
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,470
When trapped in a nightmare,

381
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,620
one loses all five senses.

382
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:18,090
Only someone close can enter through spirit consciousness

383
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:19,090
to bring her out.

384
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:20,200
I'll go.

385
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,240
No way.

386
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,300
Dreams have hidden murderous intents.

387
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,130
A minor slip up

388
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,830
and you might die

389
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,830
before saving her.

390
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,150
I'll go.

391
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:29,820
No.

392
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:30,910
I have to go.

393
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,160
Why?

394
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:35,280
Now Jin Renfeng is lurking in Tushan,

395
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,350
waiting to deliver a fatal blow.

396
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,710
Only you can stop him

397
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:40,980
and protect

398
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,640
her primordial spirit.

399
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,440
Well...

400
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,840
Tushan's raised me for 16 years.

401
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,390
I'm eternally grateful.

402
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,240
Don't worry.

403
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,880
I'll bring her back.

404
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,390
Remember,

405
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,830
you can't use magic in dreams

406
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,440
as they'll backfire.

407
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:02,960
Also,

408
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,200
you must get her out when the blood moon is full.

409
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,130
Or you two

410
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,960
will be trapped in the nightmare

411
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,270
and never return.

412
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,680
Lady Fairy.

413
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,720
What a grand feast for the spirits!

414
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,240
Unfortunately,

415
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,480
all of this will end

416
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,070
in my hands.

417
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,490
Dongfang Yuechu

418
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,640
and the spirits are up next.

419
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:29,810
Oh no.

420
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,930
The tree's heart has changed.

421
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,640
There's spirit aura.

422
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,790
That human's saving a bird spirit.

423
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,020
You're also a spirit.

424
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,670
A fox spirit from Tushan.

425
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,370
Fear not.

426
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,730
Yiqi Alliance's men are everywhere.

427
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:16,260
Let's hide somewhere else.

428
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,840
Who are you?

429
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,670
Why should I believe you?

430
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,480
Because you have no choice.

431
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,240
Stop there!

432
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:27,590
Let's go.

433
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:28,190
Don't run!

434
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,300
Hurry!

435
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,200
Lady Fairy!

436
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,240
Today,

437
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,390
we must capture the Tushan fox spirit!

438
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:48,950
Yes!

439
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,310
This umbrella

440
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:56,870
can mask your spirit aura.

441
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,450
Let's go.

442
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,210
I'll take you to avoid the Yiqi spies

443
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:02,120
and leave from the mountain path.

444
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:02,980
You are a human,

445
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,170
and I'm a spirit?

446
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,110
Yes.

447
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,440
Not all are the same.

448
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,200
There are evil humans

449
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,400
and kind spirits too.

450
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,110
Lady Fairy.

451
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,510
No matter who he is,

452
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,750
don't listen to him.

453
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,980
Wake up and go back with me.

454
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,980
Leave here now.

455
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:24,970
Lady Fairy!

456
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,680
Get her out when the blood moon is full.

457
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:30,570
Or you two

458
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,430
will be trapped in the nightmare

459
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:33,610
and never return.

460
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,230
Lady Fairy!

461
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:40,940
Lady Fairy!

462
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,340
Don't go with him!

463
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:44,850
Tushan Honghong!

464
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:56,580
Let's go.

465
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,550
They're coming.

466
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,140
Someone's calling me.

467
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,040
Lady Fairy.

468
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:01,550
Come on.

469
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,240
Lady Fairy, I'll take you back.

470
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,440
Dongfang Yuechu?

471
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,440
Why's he in there?

472
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,950
No wonder the tree's heart has changed.

473
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,320
That wretch again.

474
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,990
How stupid is he

475
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,600
to save that fox with his life?

476
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,310
Lady Fairy.

477
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:23,720
This is a dream. Wake up.

478
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,080
Don't let them hurt you.

479
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,200
Lady Fairy!

480
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,370
Remember,

481
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:35,490
you can't use magic in dreams,

482
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,990
as they'll backfire.

483
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,040
Yuechu?

484
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:28,870
Lady...

485
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,250
Fairy.

486
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,240
It's Chief!

487
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:12,960
Here comes our Feathered Flowers!

488
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,770
Yes.

489
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,150
Chief's really something.

490
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,550
Bonds formed under Grief Tree

491
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,760
will be protected by Tushan,

492
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,670
overcome all obstacles,

493
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,440
and never be forgotten.

494
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:39,780
I got it.

495
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,210
I got a Feathered Flower!

496
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:43,090
Look.

497
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,500
I got a flower.

498
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:46,260
Look, Guoguo!

499
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,920
It's been so long.

500
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:49,739
Where's Yaya?

501
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,380
Why are you always yapping

502
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:53,550
about Yaya?

503
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,110
What's between you two?

504
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,470
Could it be...

505
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,110
you have a crush on her?

506
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,000
You're so nosy!

507
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:01,960
Right?

508
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:16,230
Congratulations to those who got a flower.

509
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:17,750
Those who didn't get one,

510
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:19,430
don't be discouraged.

511
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,820
Ask for it again in 100 years.

512
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:34,530
I got a flower.

513
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,000
Look.

514
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,150
Why isn't Yaya here?

515
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:44,370
That's right.

516
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:46,060
I just fought

517
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:48,650
Jin Renfeng with Lady Fairy a few times.

518
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:51,220
It can't be love.

519
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,250
Lady Fairy.

520
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,600
No.

521
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,260
Your power's been exhausted in Grief Tree's heart.

522
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,670
Don't waste more on me.

523
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,030
Don't refuse it.

524
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,670
From now on,

525
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,590
no matter what happens,

526
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,610
you must take care of yourself.

527
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,760
Don't take risks.

528
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:40,890
Don't get hurt.

529
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,600
Okay.

530
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,140
Besides saving you,

531
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:50,270
I won't let myself take risks.

532
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:54,360
Not even for saving me.

533
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,630
You're not fully healed,

534
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:07,980
but you're fine now.

535
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,360
I wonder how Yaya's doing.

536
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,820
Yaya found Jin Renfeng at the back mountain.

537
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,000
This time,

538
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:27,070
we can't let him go no matter what.

539
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:29,280
Jin Renfeng

540
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,320
chose to attack Tushan during

541
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,650
the matchmaking event,

542
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,030
which means

543
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,280
he has more tricks up his sleeve.

544
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,600
What do you mean?

545
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,580
No matter what,

546
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,840
Grief Tree just helped with matchmaking.

547
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,040
Its power's still unstable.

548
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:51,750
Why don't you go help Yaya?

549
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:54,230
I'll guard Grief Tree.

550
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:55,910
Okay.

551
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,070
Take care.

552
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:24,000
Master, what now?

553
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,140
Ignite the Dark Force

554
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,630
and complete Spirit Lord's mission.

555
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,070
How dare you...

556
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:32,120
break into Tushan!

557
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,140
Retreat!

558
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,040
How dare you provoke Tushan!

559
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,490
You've got some nerve!

560
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,130
Lady Fairy's in danger.

561
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:48,900
Honghong.

562
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,150
I knew it.

563
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,720
The target's still Grief Tree.

564
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,300
Some spirit power is absorbing Grief Tree's power.

565
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,430
You

566
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:15,440
can't escape!

567
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:30,780
Darn it. He got away again.

568
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,070
What power was that?

569
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:32,670
Whatever.

570
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:34,090
Let's go save Lady Fairy.

571
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,430
