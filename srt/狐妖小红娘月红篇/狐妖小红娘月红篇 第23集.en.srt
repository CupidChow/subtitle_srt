4
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,750
Chief, you're really busy.

5
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,990
You don't even have the time to meet me,

6
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,120
the representative of Yiqi Alliance.

7
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,120
Dongfang Yuechu?

8
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,280
What?

9
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,100
Are you pretending that you don't know me?

10
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,620
Where is Elder?

11
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,420
You sent him to spy on me?

12
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,120
What are you doing?

13
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,329
Let go.

14
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:19,570
No.

15
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,240
We... have to make it clear today.

16
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,240
What do you want to say?

17
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,590
I want to say...

18
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,070
I...

19
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,630
We...

20
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,230
Forget it.

21
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,280
Let me ask you.

22
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,780
Since you agreed to cooperate,

23
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,750
why did you leave us alone?

24
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,150
I have my own consideration.

25
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,220
You have your own consideration?

26
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,750
Chi Sha Bandits have entered

27
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,170
Fire Dragon Valley.

28
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,910
There's a poisonous miasma.

29
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,680
What’s your plan?

30
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,980
Don’t worry.

31
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:01,230
I have things to do.

32
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,590
For Dongfang Luo,

33
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,860
you're being this cold to me?

34
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,430
Let's continue.

35
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,400
You brat!

36
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,500
You think you can hold me down with just a few small fry?

37
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,140
You reached a dead end, right?

38
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,840
I told you.

39
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,370
She doesn't want to see you.

40
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,710
What's the point of looking for her?

41
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,660
You don't know her.

42
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,240
She's just busy.

43
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,000
Sure.

44
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,400
When it comes to people one doesn't want to see,

45
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,080
of course they have to use the excuse of being busy.

46
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,150
It's not an excuse.

47
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,960
Think about it.

48
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,450
After I left,

49
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,270
how many people in Tushan can help Honghong?

50
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,280
Can she handle it alone?

51
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:15,560
Brat!

52
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,269
Don’t say that.

53
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,360
Why is there no one helping Chief?

54
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,450
Not only us,

55
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,750
even Dongfang Luo has been helping.

56
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,550
Dongfang Luo?

57
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,800
What can a nerd do?

58
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,030
N-Nothing.

59
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,080
Let's drink.

60
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,590
Fine.

61
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,800
Now that Yiqi Alliance is working with Tushan,

62
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,530
you'll know it sooner or later.

63
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,820
Right now,

64
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:50,480
Chi Sha Bandits are hiding in Huolong Valley.

65
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,940
To capture the evil spirits in the valley,

66
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,120
we must get through the poisonous miasma first.

67
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,260
Dongfang Luo

68
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,650
is trying the medicine on his own body.

69
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,430
He's trying the medicine with his body?

70
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,790
Can he do it?

71
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,830
Whether he can do it,

72
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,450
I have no idea.

73
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,480
But Chief believes him.

74
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,190
Kid.

75
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,630
Listen to my advice.

76
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,390
Once women in this world

77
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,160
change their mind,

78
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:27,430
they can't wait to forget everything in the past.

79
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,510
Why are you so persistent to give her a hard time?

80
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,690
But Honghong is not an ordinary person.

81
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,070
Of course she's not.

82
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,980
She's more heartless than ordinary women.

83
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,130
If someone she doesn't like

84
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,750
keeps hanging around her,

85
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,140
it's like...

86
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,800
Like...

87
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,330
Just like this fly.

88
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,920
It's annoying.

89
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:56,760
Look.

90
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,680
Isn't it annoying?

91
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,360
I don't believe you.

92
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,240
You're a bad fox.

93
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,870
You never liked me getting along with Honghong.

94
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,430
You...

95
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,870
She wants to forget me?

96
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,030
I won't let it happen.

97
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,800
Yuechu.

98
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,890
You're here.

99
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,500
I'm here to see you.

100
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,480
Not bad.

101
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:36,230
You're good at using the magic tool I gave you.

102
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,070
It's been all

103
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,100
thanks to the magic tool you gave me.

104
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,510
Sit down and eat a little.

105
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,400
No need.

106
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,140
I ate before I came.

107
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,310
Okay, then I won't stand on ceremony.

108
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:57,000
It's inconvenient for you to live here alone, right?

109
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,850
Not exactly.

110
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,430
This place may look shabby,

111
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,420
but with Honghong's care,

112
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,310
it's quite comfortable

113
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:05,650
and peaceful.

114
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,020
Care?

115
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,990
So, you caused trouble for Honghong?

116
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,560
Why didn't I think of that before?

117
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,060
Thank you for reminding me.

118
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:18,770
Tomorrow,

119
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,920
I'll discuss with Honghong to move to Tushan.

120
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,250
So that she won't have to go back and forth.

121
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:24,750
No way.

122
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,050
If you go discuss with her,

123
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,980
aren't you causing her trouble too?

124
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:30,840
How about this?

125
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,600
Aren't we friends?

126
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,409
If you need anything,

127
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,550
just let me know.

128
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,030
I'm not afraid of trouble.

129
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,060
What trouble?

130
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:41,670
Honghong.

131
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,530
Why are you here?

132
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,930
To see a friend.

133
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,510
Luo is my...

134
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,290
close friend, right?

135
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,100
Indeed.

136
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,840
Yuechu is passionate and loyal.

137
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,480
He is indeed a good friend.

138
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,909
Honghong, have you eaten?

139
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,150
Didn't you just say...

140
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,660
I get hungry fast.

141
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,480
Besides,

142
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,390
even the magic tool you use to cook was given by me.

143
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,770
You will be willing

144
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,330
to give me some food, right?

145
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,410
Of course.

146
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:26,930
Thank you.

147
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:40,950
Yuechu.

148
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,150
You are our guest.

149
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,620
Don't be shy.

150
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,830
Dongfang Luo.

151
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,180
No one will think you're a mute if you don't speak.

152
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,370
Why are you here?

153
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,210
I... I told you.

154
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,760
I'm here to visit my friend.

155
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,350
Visit?

156
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:57,810
Yes.

157
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:02,030
Luo is using his body to test medicine to capture the evil spirits.

158
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,600
As the representative of Yiqi Alliance,

159
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,170
I'm here to show my concern.

160
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,870
How did you know about this?

161
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,290
As long as I want,

162
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,700
nothing in Tushan can be hidden from me.

163
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,910
Just kidding.

164
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,630
Don’t take it seriously, Chief.

165
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,360
But regarding the medicine testing,

166
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,360
Yiqi Alliance is also qualified to participate in it.

167
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,550
It's about enough.

168
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,840
How do you feel today?

169
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,310
I feel my limbs and joints are much more relaxed.

170
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,390
But my chest

171
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,030
still feels dull.

172
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,150
I found that

173
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,040
the poison in your body is weakening.

174
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,680
It means this medicine does work.

175
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,680
But your body hasn't been completely detoxified.

176
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,530
Looks like we need to continue to modify this prescription.

177
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,710
In that case,

178
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,000
it's quite useful to test the medicine with a body.

179
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,260
In my opinion,

180
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,010
Luo has low cultivation and a weak foundation.

181
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,350
He won't be able to take much of this testing.

182
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,510
How about I try it?

183
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,870
I'm a tough man.

184
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,130
What do you think?

185
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,380
Rest well today.

186
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:24,790
I'll take my leave.

187
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,120
Sure. I'm sorry for the inconvenience today.

188
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,450
Let's talk another day.

189
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,810
Wait for me.

190
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,390
Honghong.

191
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,950
What do you want?

192
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,270
Don't you know what I want to do?

193
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,400
I knew it.

194
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,010
Do you hate me so much just because

195
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,770
I'm from Yiqi Alliance?

196
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,480
-Listen to me–
-Listen.

197
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,210
Tushan won't allow anyone

198
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,150
to destroy the cooperation between the two alliances.

199
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,150
Of course I know that.

200
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,360
You'd better know.

201
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,590
Also,

202
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,600
stay away from Twin Peaks.

203
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,700
If I find you

204
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,030
trespass places outside of the market,

205
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,780
don't blame me for being rude.

206
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,280
Divine Flame Villa?

207
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,120
Why are we here?

208
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:25,840
I believe

209
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,840
there should be two woman abductors.

210
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,320
Two woman abductors?

211
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,310
That's right.

212
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:32,150
One of them is the one you mentioned

213
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,120
who is shallow

214
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,000
and only cares about looks.

215
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,930
I didn't say he's shallow and only cares about looks.

216
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,330
It doesn't matter.

217
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,290
The other one is?

218
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,470
The other is...

219
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,690
the real murderer of the female disciples of Yiqi Alliance.

220
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,090
You knew those girls

221
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,000
were not killed by the woman abductor.

222
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,120
Why is the woman abductor still a wanted person?

223
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,230
Why does that matter?

224
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,000
They are all criminals I want to catch anyway.

225
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,930
You're a constable, yet you're so reckless.

226
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,170
No wonder you couldn't catch the culprit.

227
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:58,600
You...

228
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,240
I don't want to argue with you.

229
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,730
Anyway, when we see Fu Cheng,

230
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,300
we will be able to find clues

231
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,130
and solve the case quickly.

232
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,550
Fu... Fu Cheng?

233
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,080
The female survivor

234
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,110
who fought with the culprit at the prison that day

235
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,110
is Fu Cheng from Divine Flame Villa.

236
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:19,840
Oh no.

237
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,200
I met Fu Cheng before.

238
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,890
If she sees through me,

239
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,790
it will be bad.

240
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,740
Why aren't you moving?

241
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,380
What are you doing?

242
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,150
You're a man.

243
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,630
Why are you being so wishy-washy?

244
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,480
I...

245
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,170
I'm just shy.

246
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,460
Why?

247
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,810
I'm a man.

248
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,980
How can I enter the bedroom

249
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,690
of a lady who hasn't married?

250
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,580
It's really...

251
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,490
I'm shy...

252
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:58,870
Wait here.

253
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,090
The person who abducted me

254
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,270
was a fox spirit with a mask.

255
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:24,670
A fox spirit?

256
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,870
I've dealt with spirits before.

257
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:29,600
I can recognize the aura of the fox spirit in them.

258
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,930
Was there anyone else?

259
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:34,750
Anyone else?

260
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,600
I think...

261
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,800
There was another man.

262
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,760
Do you remember his face?

263
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,330
Well...

264
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,390
Ms. Fu.

265
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,420
Constable Lyu.

266
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,850
The doctor said,

267
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,630
she needs some time

268
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,870
to recover completely.

269
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,870
She can't get agitated before that.

270
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,790
Why don't you ask her when she gets better?

271
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,180
How is it, Constable Lyu?

272
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:27,090
Have you found the real murderer

273
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,780
and we can go capture them now?

274
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,640
Shut up.

275
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,960
What?

276
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,040
Didn't you say

277
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,280
you can solve the case after seeing Ms. Fu?

278
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:36,870
Go away!

279
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,200
Oh no!

280
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,000
The aura-dispelling pillar.

281
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,180
[Speak frankly]

282
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,560
Miss, I never break my promise.

283
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,120
This aura...

284
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,880
The woman abductor!

285
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,400
You've been lying to me.

286
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,500
So you are the woman abductor.

287
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,600
Yes.

288
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,040
I did lie to you.

289
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,540
But I have nothing to do with the death of those women.

290
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,660
I was framed.

291
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,690
Why didn't they frame others?

292
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,280
If you hadn't always deceived women,

293
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,740
and be notorious for that,

294
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,550
why would the real murderer go around

295
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,150
harming people in your name?

296
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,750
How dare you lie to me?

297
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,700
Saying you wanted protection.

298
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,570
I...

299
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,340
Just like you,

300
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,230
I want to find the real murderer.

301
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:43,760
Excuses!

302
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:44,840
Do you dare to say

303
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,170
you've never cheated a woman's feelings?

304
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,010
I...

305
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,620
I will arrest you today

306
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,250
and eliminate evil for the people.

307
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,120
Please forgive me for not cooperating

308
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,050
before the real murderer is captured.

309
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:06,840
Sorry.

310
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,280
Go after him!

311
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:15,870
Don't let him escape!

312
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:16,360
Yes!

313
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,740
Over there!

314
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,720
Full moon...

315
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,770
Although you have the talent to cultivate,

316
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:38,570
you're not good enough to practice Tushan's magic

317
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:39,690
as an outsider.

318
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,410
Every full moon night,

319
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,530
Tushan's magic will go with the light of the pure moon.

320
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:46,790
You will also lose your power

321
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,450
and show your true form.

322
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,750
Strange.

323
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,510
He was here just now.

324
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,020
Why did he disappear in the blink of an eye?

325
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,970
I don't think he can get far.

326
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,750
Who are you?

327
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:12,829
Tell us your name.

328
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,109
So ugly.

329
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:25,730
Boss.

330
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,550
Look how ugly he is.

331
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,680
He's being all sneaky too.

332
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,030
He must be a bad guy.

333
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,490
Say something!

334
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,200
You're not saying anything?

335
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,930
You're still trying to resist in this situation?

336
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,500
Wait.

337
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,510
According to the new rules of Yiqi Alliance,

338
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,160
spirits who have done nothing bad,

339
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,720
regardless of their race or appearance,

340
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,450
should be treated like humans.

341
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,240
Spirit,

342
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,440
we are the constables of the humans' Yiqi Alliance.

343
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,030
As long as you don't harm people,

344
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,400
we won't hurt you.

345
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:14,960
Wait!

346
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,220
Boss.

347
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,950
Even though he looks extremely ugly now,

348
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:22,360
it can't rule out that he's not Yan Rushan.

349
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,460
Maybe this is how

350
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,140
Yan Rushan really looks like.

351
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,570
I hid here

352
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,480
because the mud here

353
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,540
can cover my scent.

354
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,030
Don't come near me...

355
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,650
Don't come over!

356
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,590
He's not Yan Rushan.

357
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,310
The woman abductor has escaped.

358
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,970
That's all for today. Let's continue tomorrow.

359
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,000
You're still not coming out?

360
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,030
Do you not want to see me?

361
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:36,890
Brother!

362
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,130
Why are you here?

363
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,510
Brother.

364
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:45,770
I heard that Chi Sha Bandits escaped the prison.

365
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,480
I was just thinking about it.

366
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,240
I finally found out about it.

367
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,230
You've murdered a few spirits here.

368
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,830
How can a mere Huntian Prison

369
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:56,030
trap you in?

370
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,200
Stop circling around me. I feel dizzy.

371
00:19:59,200 --> 00:19:59,900
I'll stop.

372
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,750
Brother.

373
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,940
You should let me join Chi Sha Bandits now.

374
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:05,990
How many times have I told you?

375
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,960
You're not qualified enough. Stop causing trouble for me.

376
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,360
Go back to your hometown.

377
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,960
But I've been trying my best!

378
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:13,980
Trying your best?

379
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,510
With your qualifications,

380
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,310
no matter how hard you try, it'd be useless.

381
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:17,840
Here!

382
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:18,950
What is it?

383
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,370
Your favorite food.

384
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,510
Leave now.

385
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:32,670
Fine.

386
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,960
If you don't leave, I'll leave.

387
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:43,030
Is it because I haven't made much accomplishments

388
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:43,960
and you don't think I'm good enough

389
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,620
so you won't let me join Chi Sha Bandits?

390
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,050
Who likes to eat this?

391
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,380
This fool.

392
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,140
We ate corn all day

393
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,330
because we had nothing to eat.

394
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,700
If there are delicacies to eat everyday,

395
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:26,900
why would I eat this?

396
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:38,040
It's from your useless brother again?

397
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,860
Don't say that about Chi Shan.

398
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,750
Since you're so protective of Chi Shan,

399
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,760
why don't you take him with you?

400
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,910
We are always fighting and killing.

401
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,230
There's no tomorrow.

402
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,410
Why would I bring him along?

403
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,880
He may not understand

404
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,270
your efforts.

405
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,680
Chieftain Chi.

406
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,110
Have you thought about

407
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,930
what I proposed last time?

408
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,800
Forget about the cooperation.

409
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,960
Aren't you afraid that Tushan Honghong will come?

410
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,370
We'll run if she does.

411
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,940
Why don't you know something so simple?

412
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,010
To retreat without a fight.

413
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,000
Aren't you afraid of

414
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,310
being laughed at?

415
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:36,660
So what?

416
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,680
Since I was young,

417
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,110
I've done a lot of things like this.

418
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,680
It doesn't matter if it's just one more.

419
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:54,160
Dongfang Yuechu ran away from Elder

420
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,350
and followed you?

421
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:59,680
He seems to care about capturing the spirits,

422
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:03,190
but I think, he has another motive.

423
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,190
Of course he does.

424
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,830
I mean he must have another motive.

425
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:17,980
You have no idea.

426
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,240
He is

427
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,350
cunning.

428
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:25,100
He must be up to something asking to cooperate this time.

429
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,640
You seem to know him well.

430
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,520
I've investigated him before.

431
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,200
When you weren't around

432
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,020
and the representatives of Yiqi Alliance

433
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,150
came over,

434
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,220
I investigated his background.

435
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,490
For his reputation,

436
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,130
he can do anything.

437
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,680
He even made many magic tools

438
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,990
and distributed them to the human race.

439
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:55,110
Using magic tools to win over people's hearts...

440
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,680
He's pretty ambitious.

441
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:58,900
Pretty ambitious?

442
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,930
He's extremely ambitious!

443
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,800
Sister, listen to me.

444
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,110
Stay away from him.

445
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,110
Don't let him succeed in achieving his motive.

446
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,240
I got it.

447
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:13,880
Go back first.

448
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,910
I need to go visit Dongfang Luo.

449
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,170
Enough.

450
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,620
Enough!

451
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:08,520
Honghong...

452
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,280
Is your remaining poison acting up?

453
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,930
It's fine. I'll be fine soon.

454
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,510
I know my own body.

455
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:31,760
It's okay.

456
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,070
I chose this path.

457
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,670
No matter how hard I suffer,

458
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,130
I have to endure it myself.

459
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,070
If it doesn't work, don't force yourself.

460
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,610
Let’s enter the valley first and think of other ways.

461
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,510
The medicine testing has been effective.

462
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,450
In a few more days,

463
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,840
the antidote will be developed successfully.

464
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,840
There's no rush about the antidote.

465
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,000
Why?

466
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:58,200
The terrain of Huolong Valley is complicated.

467
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,930
If we break in rashly, we'll be rendered passive.

468
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,950
Why don't we find another way

469
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,550
to lure them out?

470
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:08,510
If someone who is not afraid of the poisonous miasma

471
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:11,000
can enter the valley in advance to figure out the terrain,

472
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,120
it will be perfect.

473
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:14,240
This is a feasible way.

474
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,780
Send Yan Rushan.

475
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,620
He grew up in Kongxian Mountain.

476
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,590
Poison does nothing to his body.

477
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:22,310
I think

478
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,960
this poisonous miasma won't hurt him.

479
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,410
That'd be the best.

480
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:35,090
[Zhizheng Hall]

481
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Go to Huolong Valley to check the terrain.

482
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,050
Huolong Valley?

483
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,350
Boss, what else can I do for you?

484
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:55,900
Be careful.

485
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:56,870
Go and investigate quickly.

486
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:57,260
Yes.

487
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,240
Looks like

488
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:04,570
I can only come see you after I return from Huolong Valley.

489
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,240
Yan Rushan?

490
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,080
Who asked me to come here?

491
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:27,800
Come out.

492
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,430
You've improved so much.

493
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:53,110
Looks like you haven't slacked off for these three years.

00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,000
No.

508
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,270
Great.

509
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,590
Yuechu is back,

510
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,060
and you're back too.

511
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,880
Tushan can be lively again.

512
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,040
Yuechu is back?

513
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,940
A while ago, evil spirits escaped from Huntian Prison.

514
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,190
Yiqi Alliance sent him as a representative

515
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,590
to Tushan to capture the spirits together.

516
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,000
But given your sister's current condition,

517
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,070
they'd better not meet each other.

518
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:53,510
That's right.

519
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:56,240
So Rongrong and I have been very worried these days.

520
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,000
We're afraid that he'd go look for Honghong

521
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,110
on a whim.

522
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,090
Fortunately, Elder is watching.

523
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:04,530
Nothing will go wrong for the time being.

524
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,040
That's good.

525
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,510
Let me ask you.

526
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:15,820
If I forget you one day,

527
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,030
what would you do?

528
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,170
I won't let you forget me.

529
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,320
And I won't forget you.

530
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:28,880
Don't worry.

531
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,880
Even if we have to part one day,

532
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,750
I won't forget you.

533
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,890
You managed to make the antidote?

534
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,220
My suffering has not been in vain.

535
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,160
But your body hasn't been completely detoxified.

536
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,290
In the next few days,

537
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,640
I will go to the pharmacy

538
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,480
to buy more of the main herbs used in the antidote

539
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,640
to make more of them.

540
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:04,080
That's great.

541
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:07,790
Once Yan Rushan finds out about the terrain,

542
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:10,370
we can go to Huolong Valley to capture them.

543
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,510
Honghong.

544
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,270
Has Yuechu been pestering you recently?

545
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,640
How do you know?

546
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,510
You know.

547
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,880
Those flower spirits can't keep their mouths shut.

548
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,210
If they can tell Yuechu your whereabouts,

549
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,730
they can also let me know his whereabouts.

550
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:32,030
He asked the flower spirits about my whereabouts?

551
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,660
You don't know about this?

552
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,780
That was nosy of me.

553
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,160
But have you ever thought

554
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,770
why is he doing this?

555
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,250
Why?

556
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,370
Tushan is the same as before.

557
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,500
But Lady Fairy seems to have changed.

558
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,350
Black spiritual butterfly?

559
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,910
It's the middle of the night.

560
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,260
What are you doing here?

561
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:25,470
What's with that spiritual butterfly?

562
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,260
You're suspecting me?

563
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,530
I thought you were just being cold to me.

564
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,640
I didn't expect you to suspect me.

565
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,070
In that case,

566
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,050
why did you agree to cooperate with me?

567
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:45,630
The alliance between the two clans is beneficial to the spirit clan.

568
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,110
S-So, you agreed to cooperate

569
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,020
just for the spirit clan?

570
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,500
What else?

571
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,570
You misunderstood.

572
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:02,190
I just found that spiritual butterfly.

573
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,940
Do you really think I'll believe you?

574
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:22,120
What's your relationship with Nangong Shi?

575
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,640
Nangong Shi?

576
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:26,800
What do you mean?

577
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,410
Nangong Shi colluded with evil spirits and raided the Huntian Prison.

578
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,090
How involved were you?

579
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,800
What happened at Huntian Prison

580
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,210
has something to do with Nangong Shi?

581
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:39,000
Answer me.

582
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,640
Will you believe me?

583
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,620
Do you think if you don't speak,

584
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,280
I don't have a way to make you?

585
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,880
No matter how down and out I am,

586
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,920
I will never join hands with him.

587
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,660
He doesn't deserve to.

588
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,250
In that case,

589
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,640
don't blame me.

590
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,730
Find a way to make him speak.

591
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,370
You mean to use poison?

592
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,860
Either poison or torture's fine.

593
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,410
I can

594
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,760
use poison.

595
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,370
How about this?

596
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:20,450
You go back first.

597
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,670
Leave it to me.

598
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:37,880
You...

599
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:39,640
Get up.

600
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,960
Chief has left.

601
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,480
Tell me the truth.

602
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,680
Why is Honghong being like this to me?

603
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,150
It's fine that she distanced herself from me.

604
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:53,810
Why is she even suspecting me?

605
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,150
I've been with her for so many years.

606
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,240
So many years!

607
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:00,030
How could she turn against me so easily?

608
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,310
As you said,

609
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,310
you’ve been together for so many years.

610
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,960
You should know her well.

611
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:07,350
You should know that she only thinks of

612
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:09,110
Spirit Alliance and Tushan.

613
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,620
And Dongfang Luo.

614
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:13,909
That's right.

615
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:15,250
And Dongfang Luo.

616
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,909
Since you know everything,

617
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,440
why bring up the past

618
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,360
that she doesn't want to talk about?

619
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,580
If you keep pestering her,

620
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,310
of course she'd be suspicious.

621
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,230
So it’s my fault?

622
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,480
Of course.

623
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,969
Listen to my advice.

624
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,670
Now you and Chief

625
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:34,110
represent Spirit Alliance and Yiqi Alliance.

626
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,770
Why don't you just do your job?

627
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,699
As for the other things...

628
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,750
What about them?

629
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,560
There's no need to mention them.

630
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,219
You need to know that for a man,

631
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,280
to leave seemingly unaffected,

632
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:48,179
is also a way to be gentlemanly.

633
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,710
That may be true,

634
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:52,449
but if one day

635
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,690
Yaya and you come to this situation,

636
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,150
could you act unaffected?

637
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,510
We are talking about Chief and you.

638
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,800
Why mention me?

639
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,490
I should have poisoned you.

640
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:02,930
Fine.

641
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:05,490
I have something important to discuss with you.

642
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:06,860
Fu Cheng has woken up.

643
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,560
One of the people who abducted her that day

644
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,290
was a fox spirit wearing a mask.

645
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,590
One of the people?

646
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:14,390
You mean there are other people?

647
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,600
Fu Cheng was injured.

648
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,800
She can't remember other people's faces.

649
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,780
But if Nangong Shi is really involved

650
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,290
as Honghong said,

651
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:22,710
after Fu Cheng recovers,

652
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,620
we might have other discoveries.

653
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,450
Why are you telling me this?

654
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:31,860
I know poisoning people is not your only ability.

655
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,330
If there is medicine that can help Fu Cheng recover soon,

656
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:35,930
maybe we can find another way

657
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,210
to find the key behind the case of Huntian Prison.

658
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,630
You're really doing everything

659
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,960
to chase after me.

660
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,690
It's just that you shouldn't be here.

661
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,800
Go back now.

662
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,660
Cut it out.

663
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,260
Surrender now!

664
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,760
Lyu Jianwen!

665
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,670
Come out.

666
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,340
Don't get me wrong, Chieftain Chi.

667
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,470
I'm here to join you.

668
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:42,710
Join me?

669
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,040
What do you mean?

670
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,760
This is not a place to talk.

671
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,190
How about

672
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:50,700
we go in first?

673
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,910
She won't last any longer.

674
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:07,110
Give me the antidote.

675
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,590
Hurry up.

676
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,450
You seem quite

677
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,650
worried about her.

678
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,680
I'm worried for you.

679
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:19,350
If she dies,

680
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,160
she won't be of any value.

681
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:42,830
I, Lyu Jianwen,

682
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,360
would rather die than be threatened by you.

683
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:53,390
Yan Rushan.

684
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:53,920
Shut up!

685
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:56,780
This is not your Zhizheng Hall.

686
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,310
It's not up to you to act wildly.

687
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:58,800
You!

688
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,290
Yan Rushan,

689
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,940
what are you up to?

690
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:08,840
Are you satisfied

691
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,550
with my gift?

692
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,630
Did you lure her here?

693
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:15,790
Of course.

694
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:18,820
Yan Rushan.

695
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,380
You're working with...

696
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,670
You're working with Chi Lei?

697
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,720
So what if I am?

698
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,310
It's all thanks to you

699
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,710
for being persistent in chasing after me,

700
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,910
and sacrificing for the greater cause.

701
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,480
You want to join us?

702
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:34,990
Back then, as an outsider,

703
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:37,630
you asked Tushan Rongrong to be your master.

704
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:40,030
This has spread throughout the six realms.

705
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:43,710
How can you become an evil spirit again?

706
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,840
There's something you don't know.

707
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,190
I was wanted

708
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:49,790
by Yiqi Alliance just for flirting

709
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:51,790
with a few girls, and had to hide.

710
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,580
Even Tushan treated me as an evil spirit.

711
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:58,470
She wanted to expel me and leave me to the human race to be executed.

712
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,590
I have nowhere else to go.

713
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:04,190
I heard that you've always been loyal.

714
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,590
So I came to seek shelter.

715
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,110
If you can save me,

716
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:11,960
I will do anything

717
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,840
to serve you

718
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,190
and obey everything.
