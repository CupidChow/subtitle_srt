a seed absorbed the spiritual energy of heaven and earth

6
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,150
and sprouted into a towering Grief Tree,

7

attracting the fox clan to live here.

8
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,030
700 years ago,

9
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,380

10
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,600
to invade the human race to dominate the six realms.

11

Humans fought hard under the leadership of Yiqi Alliance.

Both sides suffered countless casualties.

After that,

and became a spirit matchmaker.

The love produced by lovers

32

nourishes the Grief Tree in turn,

33

Then why do you insist on keeping him?

175
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,280
He's a human kid with

176
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,330
weak shoulders

177
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:10,330
and hands.

178
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,330
All things aside,

179
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,790
just his existence

180
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,100
would cost a hefty sum.

181
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:15,450
Rongrong.

182
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:16,690
Do the calculations.

183
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,410
Tell her how much it'd cost to raise a human kid.

184
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,370
With the accommodation,

185
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:22,280
education, food,

186
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,730
yearly seasonal clothing,

187
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:24,890
shoes and socks,

188
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,620
and other possible accidents,

189
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,510
it'd cost about 786 silver taels

190
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,820
to raise him to an adult.

191
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,010
So much?

192
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,730
Just send him away.

193
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,220
Since you can't tolerate him,

194
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,570
why don't you drive him away?

195
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,650
Me?

196
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,250
Yaya, he's an orphan without parents

197
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,500
and magic powers.

198
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,760
It should be easy

199
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,730
to kick him out.

200
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,210
He has no powers?

201
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,640
If I send him away,

202
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,390
will he die?

203
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:03,030
Forget it then.

204
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,960
Chief!

205
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,210
What is it?

206

Chief.

207
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,930
That human can't stay in Tushan.

208
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,120
He's not from our clan.

209

[Tushan's elder: Tushan Buzui]

210
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,160
He must have other intentions.

211
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,700
Moreover, humans are evil and cunning.

212
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,060
Raising a human kid in Tushan

213
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,290
would be raising a wolf among the sheep.

214
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,030
Even if I'd risk angering you,

215
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,920
I've to do my duty as an elder.

216
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,610
We can't keep that brat.

217
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,830
So you're forcing me to give you an explanation?

218
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:34,890
That’s right.

219
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,920
If you don't give me or Tushan

220
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,540
an explanation,

221
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,840
I will...

222
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,980
I won't leave Huguang Pavilion.

223
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:46,390
No, no, no.

224
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:47,410
Say it again.

225
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,890
Chief, calm...

226
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,650
calm down.

227
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,120
What I mean is

228
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,440
either way,

229
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,230
we've to be fully prepared.

230
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,280
After all, humans are dangerous.

231
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,030
We can't let our guard down.

232
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,900
That's more like it.

233
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,700
Why are you still here?

234
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,180
Yes.

235
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,820
I'll take my leave.

236
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,950
What a bad temper.

237
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,980
No wonder a beauty like you

238
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,680
has no suitors

239
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,330

Dongfang Qinlan.

242
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,190
Tushan will protect you.

243
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,860
But if Tushan needs you one day,

244
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,980
you have to sacrifice your spiritual blood

245
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,490
to the Grief Tree.

246
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,000
I, Dongfang Qinlan, hereby swear

247
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,460
to make a contract with Tushan.

248
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,460
If the unexpected happens,

Twenty years ago,

hurting the production of Marriage Herb that enhances Matchmaking Power.

258

Grief Tree issued the divine decree

00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,440
that Dongfang Spiritual Blood

260
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,970
would solve this disaster.

261
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,530
You couldn't bear to hurt the innocent,

262
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,530
so you protected Qinlan for so long.

he'd rack his brains

I won't tell anyone.

517
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:37,960
But I want to know what kind of human he is

518
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:40,200
for Tushan to hide him.

519
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:44,690
He looks like a normal human man.

520
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,110
Apart from being pretty,

521
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:47,700
nothing's special.

522
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,330
What was he called?

yet I haven’t seen his shadow.

fake news about that kid's death.

If we go back now, we'll be dead.

will be trampled under our feet.

I'm fine now.

557
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,560
I didn't expect the Grief Tree's Dark Force

558
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:52,030
to be reawakened

559

after a long period of calm.

560
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:57,390
We're fox spirits born from Grief Tree.

Grief Tree is now infected by the Dark Force.

As the chief,

you're as one with Grief Tree,

so the Black Feathered Flowers grew on you.

565

We can't go on like this.

566

She doesn't have time for you.

625

The wolf spirit who collects debts in the market died?

The money's still here.

627

So it's not for money.

00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:21,850
Could it be revenge?

But when I was choosing the creditor,

630
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,170
I investigated this wolf.

633
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:34,380
A revenge murder is unlikely.

The wound is smooth and even.

637
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,220
I'm afraid you can't find

638

such a sharp sword in Tushan.

639

In that case,

640

someone sneaked into Tushan?

641
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,400
The wolf's hair is rough

00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,520
and grey.

643
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,100
But this strand of hair is so soft

644
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:10,370
and black.

645
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:12,090
It's clearly not his.

The Dark Force?

647
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,340
This force's never left Grief Tree

648
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,470
and gone elsewhere.

649
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,620

Apart from going around in Tushan,

654
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,400
the wolf is no different from the spirits in the market.

655

and just killed me long ago.

688
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:15,330
You never showed up

689
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,590
until I was roasting chicken.

690
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,290
Could it be...

691
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,720
you like my roasted chicken?

692
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,600
Don't come over.

693
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:30,520
You have Dongfang Blood

694
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,120
and dealt with Jin Renfeng.

695
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:34,850
They won't let you go.

696
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,120
Do you wanna stay with the humans

697
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,490
or go to Tushan with me?

698
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:40,080
It's up to you.
