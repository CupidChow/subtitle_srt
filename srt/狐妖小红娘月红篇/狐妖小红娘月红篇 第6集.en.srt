You plan to extract your spirit bone and rebuild the Grief Tree's heart?

7
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:07,370
I disagree.

8

Why not?

10

I'm your sidekick.

I won't allow you to risk your life.

That was just

00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,470
an excuse for you to stay in Tushan when you were young.

You've grown up.

Even so, I disagree.

You're the Chief of Tushan.

You can't sacrifice yourself.

If the current you

20
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,240
returned to the Hulu Village 16 years ago,

21
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,240
what would you do?

22
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,140
You would do your best to protect your parents

and the village.

24
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,310
You wouldn't hesitate to sacrifice yourself.

25

That's the case for me, too.

26
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,960
To me, Tushan

27
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,320
is not just my responsibility.

28
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,270
There are so many spirits

All the memories of this land

Moreover, it's not completely bad for me

00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,370
to use my spirit bone

36

to rebuild the Grief Tree's heart.

39
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,890
the Grief Tree will be revitalized,

and my power will also increase.

41

But now,

the Grief Tree's heart has been corroded by the Dark Force.

43

It's not easy to make a new couple.

No need to persuade me.

47

Chief,

48
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,250
to take the spirit bone,

49
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,420
you need to first remove your spirit power.

50
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,960
The pain is unbearable.

51
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,300
I really can't...

52
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,000
Leave.

Let Rongrong do it.

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,600

55

I'll protect Lady Fairy.

56
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,150
No.

57
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,000

Oh no.

60
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,070
Since the spirit bone has left its host,

61
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,160
Lady Fairy's remaining power

62
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,420
is not enough to support the spirit bone.

Although the spirit bone stabilized the Grief Tree,

70
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,900
the power I've extracted

71
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,670
is enough to make me a new body.

72

Though I'm not as strong as I was in my prime,

73
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,270
it's enough for the follow-up plans.

That's why I couldn't tell you.

But Honghong,

as the chief of Tushan,

152
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,040
nothing is more important than protecting Tushan

153
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,830
and the Grief Tree,

154
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,750

No buts.

Every spirit is born with a different talent.

158
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,610
The role of the strong should not be to conquer

159

but to protect.

160
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,320
The three of us were born from the Grief Tree.

161

We were born more talented than other spirits.

162
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,300
That means

163
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,700
we need to shoulder more responsibilities.

164
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,020

Do you regret it?

168

As the Chief,

169
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,840
am I worrying everyone too much?

170
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,210
You not only worry us,

171
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,910
but you also annoy us.

172

If something happens to you,

176
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,080
someone has to shoulder those things for you.

177
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,300
Just for that,

178
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:36,000
you have to take good care of yourself.

179
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,330
When did you learn to educate people?

180
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,420
You can educate others,

181
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,570
but others can't educate you?

182
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,480
How about

183
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,650
I invite the Elder here

184
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,980
and ask him to nag you instead?

185
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,020
I promise you.

186
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,160
It's getting windy.

187
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,590
Let me walk you back so you can rest.

188
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:44,360
Honghong.

189
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,480
Yuechu.

190
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,770
You're done here.

191
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,360
Go back first.

192
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:52,330
Don't worry.

193
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,280
Rongrong will take care of me.

194
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:54,970
Okay.

195
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,750
I'll visit you later.

196
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,990
Rongrong, I'm counting on you.

197
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,960
Don't you think that

198
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,440
Yuechu treats you differently?

199
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,460
That's just because since childhood,

200
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,300
he was afraid of being kicked out of Tushan,

201
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,460
so he called himself my sidekick

202
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:26,230
to get closer to me.

203
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,150
That's not what I meant.

204
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,600
Fine.

205
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,710
Putting aside what Yuechu thinks,

206
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,120
what do you think?

207
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,360
You even lost your spirit bone

208
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,780
to save him this time.

209
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,080
I told you.

210
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,270
Yuechu is innocent.

211
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,430
Are there no other reasons?

212
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,380
During the last matchmaking event,

213
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,490
Yuechu risked his life to

214
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,480
enter the nightmare to save me.

215
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,900
I owe him one.

216
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,320
So,

217
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,840
as long as there is another choice,

218
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,130
I won't sacrifice him.

219
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,870
That's all?

220
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,350
What about this time?

221
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,720
Why did you ask Yuechu to protect you?

222
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,580
That's because the Elder chickened out.

223
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,840
Even if that's the case,

224
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,820
there are so many powerful spirits in Tushan.

225
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,550
Why did you

226
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,140
entrust your life

227
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,050
to Yuechu without a thought?

228
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,450
Putting aside the fact that he's human,

229
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,240
for the past thousand years,

230
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,720
you have never trusted

231
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,960
any man this way.

232
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,080
I don't think it's just because

233
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,740
he has spiritual blood in him.

[Tushan Academy]

235
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,100
Yaya, wait for me.

236
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,340
Stop following me.

237
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,190
Are you still angry?

238
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,700
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

239
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,460
It was Honghong's order.

240
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,860
I had no choice.

241
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,920
Yes, you had no choice.

242
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,100
As long as you understand.

243
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,160
Didn't you understand everything already?

244
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,490
Why are you still angry?

245
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:09,790
Understanding doesn't mean forgiveness.

246
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,520
Anyway, don't come to me again.

247
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,310
I...

248
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,880
No way.

249
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:27,400
I brought you something good today.

250
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,460
Look.

251
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,450
This is a rare portrait of Sanshao.

Also,

256
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,640
this is Sanshao's special seal.

257
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,250
It’s just a portrait.

258
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,130
You don't have to be too thankful.

259
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:48,960
What's wrong?

260
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,750
Don't give me

things like this anymore.

262
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,550
Why?

263
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,380
You don't like it anymore?

264
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,730
It's exactly because I always

265
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,890
focus on these meaningless things

266
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,940
that I neglected to care for Tushan.

267
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:08,910
I didn't even notice that the Grief Tree was in trouble.

268
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,860
If I had realized earlier,

269
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,480
Honghong wouldn't need to sacrifice her spirit bone.

270
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,830
All right, don't be sad.

271
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,030
Try it.

272
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,640
This is much better than the portrait.

273
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,810
You're so glib-tongued.

274
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,710
Actually, what you just said

275
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,920
isn't your fault.

276
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,820
It's all the mastermind's plot.

277
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,560
Shouldn't I share more of Honghong's burden?

278
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,670
It's not too late to start now.

279
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,400
Really?

280
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,720
Of course.

281
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,370
Although I don’t like Sanshao,

282
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,760
as far as I know,

283
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,040
he also used to be a

284
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,290
mindless and heedless brat.

285
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,680
He went through hardships and challenges,

286
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,960
maturing gradually

287
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,400
to become the

288
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,820
respectable person he is now.

289
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,640
Actually, it's normal

290
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,170
to have someone you admire.

291
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,290
But instead of

292
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,790
spending unnecessary time and energy

I didn't expect the turtles of Tushan to become spirits too.

They can even send candied haws to people now.

It's a gift from the little turtle.

It's obviously for you.

308

I might as well stay here longer.

318

I know you're worried about me,

319
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,260
but I'm fine now.

Look.

321
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,630
I can even get the little turtle to send you candied haws now.

322
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:14,810
What's wrong?

323
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,680
Nothing.

324
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,690
Go back and rest after eating.

325
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,770
You don't understand.

329

spirit like you.

331
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,070
I was going to go back after settling the Grief Tree down.

332
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:54,930
But now it seems

333
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,340
I need to stay here for a while.

334
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,160
Your tendons and bones have been repositioned.

335

The external injury will heal in a few days.

336

Thank you.

I do have a request.

340
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:15,830
Go ahead.

341
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,760
Many years ago, there was someone

342

in our clan called Xiaotan.

and helped him

After that,

347
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,590
Jin Renfeng killed Xiaotan

348
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,090
to keep things a secret.

349
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,750
So,

350
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,640
back then, Jin Renfeng

351
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,790
used the leech spirit clan's blood transfusion magic

352
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,320
to get the spiritual blood.

353
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,280
That's right.

354
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,720
So if there is no new blood supply,

355
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,240
the blood in his body will gradually decay.

356
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:48,000
Although Xiaotan was bewitched by Jin Renfeng and helped the evil,

357
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,070
Jin Renfeng had no right to punish her,

358
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,510
let alone kill her.

359
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,310
Although our clan is good at healing,

360
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,830
we're not good at attacking.

361
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:56,590
So,

362

I hope you can

363
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,420
seek justice for Xiaotan.

364
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:00,920
Don't worry.

365
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,920
Tushan will not let Jin Renfeng go this time.

366

a reason for this arrangement.

It is said that the divine edict's task is closely related to the Grief Tree.

Once the mission is completed,

for something important.

516
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,720
So you are Mr. Yuechu.

517
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,240
Can you tell that I'm human too?

518
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:32,750
Yes.

519
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:36,400
I can also tell that you don't know magic.

520
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,530
A human who doesn't know magic took the risk to come here.

521
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,480
You must have something important to ask.

522
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,200
Tell me, what is it?

523
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,620
I...

524
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,440
I want to be matchmade with a spirit.

525
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,510
You like spirits?

526
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,680
I mean...

527
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,830
Can humans really fall for spirits?

528
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,360
It's surprising, isn't it?

529
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,840
My heart tells me that

530
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,440
no matter if he's a human or a spirit,

531
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:14,630
I still like him.

532
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,230
It's him!

533
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,310
Look, everyone.

534
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:18,949
It's him.

535
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,670
Him?

536
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:21,800
It's him.

537
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:26,190
I know you're from the Spirit-Master Kingdom.

538
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,440
The spirits there

539
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,530
are willing to serve the human race.

540
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:30,550
Tushan doesn't welcome you.

541
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:32,110
Get lost!

542
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,670
-You're not welcome here.
-Exactly!

543
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,480
Who is this?

544
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,920
His name is Shi Kuan.

545
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,650
He's my personal spirit guard.

546
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:39,620
Get out!

547
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:40,810
Get out!

548
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,699
Yes, go away! It's embarrassing.

549
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,510
Spirit guard?

550
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,320
You're from the Spirit-Master Kingdom?

551
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,380
I'm Bu Tai, the princess of the Spirit-Master Kingdom.

552
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:53,870
As a spirit,

553
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,179
not only do you serve and support humans,

554
00:34:56,489 --> 00:34:57,770
you work so hard for them.

555
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:59,440
You are the disgrace of the spirit clan.

556
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,070
Yes, it's him.

557
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,320
The shame of the spirit clan!

558
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,440
How can you side with the humans?

559
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,590
Get out. You are not welcome here.

560
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:04,990
The Deputy Chief is here.

561
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,000
Deputy Chief.

562
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:07,710
Deputy Chief.

563
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:08,510
Deputy Chief.

564
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,150
Deputy Chief.

565
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,550
Why are you here

566
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,310
instead of minding your business?

567
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,920
Deputy Chief, you came at the right time.

568
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,020
The spirit and master of Spirit-Master Kingdom

569
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,420
have broken into Tushan.

570
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,540
Don't be rude.

571
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,280
They are our guests.

572
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:21,960
Guests?

573
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,330
No way, Deputy Chief.

574
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,190
Spirit-Master Kingdom seldom comes in contact with the outside world.

575
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,360
Why would Tushan invite them as guests?

576
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,710
That's right.

577
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:31,570
That makes sense.

578
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,020
What do you plan to do?

579
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:37,000
We must arrest them

580
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,530
and kick them out of Tushan.

581
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,960
That's right! Kick them out of Tushan!

582
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,590
Okay.

583
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,620
I heard that

584
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,580
this spirit guard is the top warrior of Beishan,

585
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,000
Shi Kuan.

586
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,520
His hands

587
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,170
can dissolve everything.

588
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:53,270
Why don't you drive him away?

589
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:54,740
This...

590
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,730
Hurry up. What are you waiting for?

591
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,990
Why don't you all do it together?

592
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,760
I just remembered that

593
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,440
no one is tending to my stall.

594
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,480
I'm leaving.

595
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,630
Me too.

596
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,280
Guard Shi, please forgive them.

597
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,080
It's nothing.

598
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,810
Deputy Chief, please come in.

599
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,270
Have you finished collecting debts?

600
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:21,480
All you do is eat.

601
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,430
Yaya.

602
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,070
Isn't there something more important than collecting debt right now?

603
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:28,570
I know we have an important guest in Tushan.

604
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,760
I'm tending to her for you.

605
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,340
Your Highness.

606
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,550
This brat is always so unruly.

607
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,020
Please forgive him.

608
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,920
Rest assured, Deputy Chief.

609
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:42,460
Mr. Yuechu is easygoing and interesting.

610
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,430
We had a great conversation.

611
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,030
That's good.

612
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:47,310
By the way,

613
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,630
Honghong has invited you to the Huguang Pavilion.

614
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,760
Please come with me.

615
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,740
It's none of your business.

616
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,570
Stay out of it.

617
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:59,030
Honghong asked me to do this.

618
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,680
It’s very important.

619
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,260
I’ve brought what the Chief requested.

620
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,220
Something Lady Fairy requested?

621
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,230
What is it?

622
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:15,300
This is what you requested.

623
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,930
I traveled night and day

624
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:19,350
to deliver it before the specified day.

625
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:22,960
Thank you.

626
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:27,440
You don’t look well.

627
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,800
I’m fine.

628
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,280
I have completed

629
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,710
your request.

630
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,570
About my request...

631
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,950
what do you think?

632
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,820
Your Highness, do you really want to be matchmade with with a spirit?
