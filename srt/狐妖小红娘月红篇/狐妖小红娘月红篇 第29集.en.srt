[Episode 19]

4
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,920
You also clearly feel that

5
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,030
Yan Rushan should respect Lyu Jianwen.

6
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,120
Their relationship is not for him to decide unilaterally.

7
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,789
But have you ever respected me?

8
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:00,850
Did you ask me

9
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,280
before you chose to forget about me?

10
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,490
Sister!

11
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,030
Sister!

12
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,110
What's wrong?

13
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,310
I can't remember.

14
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,079
I still can't remember.

15
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,560
You're the one who brought me back to Tushan.

16
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,690
You trained with me,

17
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,880
and forced me to roast chicken.

18
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,870
We defeated Jin Renfeng together.

19
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,190
We watched Princess Bu Tai and Shi Kuan get attached,

20
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,190
established the Spirit Alliance together,

21
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,150
and shared many more memories together.

22
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,740
I've lived in the mini pavilion for 16 years.

23
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,520
Back then,

24
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,210
I even confessed to you there.

25
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,240
You rejected me,

26
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,960
and even forgot about me.

27
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
Unless...

28
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,740
he was the one I fell in love with

29
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:25,480
before I sacrificed my Love Seed?

30
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,329
What have we been through?

31
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,100
Why didn't you dodge?

32
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,480
Why should I?

33
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,070
Damn it!

34
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,070
I told you to stay away from my sister.

35
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,900
Why are you still trying to provoke her?

36
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,590
Do you know if she falls in love again,

37
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,430
she will die?

38
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,290
What do you mean?

39
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,840
Don't go! Tell me.

40
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:14,960
I won't give up

41
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,850
until you tell me what's going on.

42
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,510
This is...

43
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,240
Love Seed?

44
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,830
This Love Seed

45
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,750
is unique to my sister.

46
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,060
It has always been in her heart.

47
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,390
Three years ago,

48
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,250
Shi Ji escaped from Kuzhu Forest.

49
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,070
In order to find and stop her,

50
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,790
Honghong sacrificed her Love Seed.

51
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,720
She sacrificed her Love Seed

52
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:57,020
to seal Shi Ji with her love force.

53
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,430
It turns out that

54
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,430
it's just me

55
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,290
who's been holding on to the past.

56
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,630
So you have me in your heart,

57
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,360
and you only have me in your heart.

58
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,680
Do you understand now?

59
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,690
Why can't my sister fall in love?

60
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,260
Her heart will wither and fail.

61
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,659
Is there no remedy?

62
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,250
There is.

63
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,000
But you will die.

64
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,480
I've never been afraid of death.

65
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,310
I went to see Yan Rushan.

66
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,400
Everything is fine.

67
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,190
He just kept begging

68
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,320
for you to fulfill his wish.

69
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,400
This silly disciple of mine.

70
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,720
When I took him in as my disciple,

71
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,570
I knew he was a stubborn man.

72
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:23,000
Despite being with me for so long, he hasn't been able to tell

73
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,600
if something is worthwhile.

74
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,370
It is not up to us to decide

75
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,470
if it's worthwhile or not.

76
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,580
Are you going to fulfil his wish?

77
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,610
I might have figured out a perfect solution.

78
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,560
Inform Dongfang Yuechu to

79
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,650
go to the human race with me.

80
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,120
Wangquan Hongye

81
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,180
no longer hates the spirit clan as much as he did before.

82
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:51,170
If you are going to the human race to deal with this matter,

83
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,500
you don't actually have to go with Yuechu.

84
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,190
I already know who he is.

85
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,040
Sister.

86
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,890
Sister, you must not fall in love ever again.

87
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,280
How could a heart without its Love Seed

88
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,480
ever fall in love?

89
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,310
Have you really made up your mind?

90
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,860
Once the Sorrow-Oblivion Spell is casted,

91
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,120
she'll forget about you completely,

92
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,980
and will never think of you again.

93
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,320
Brother Yuechu,

94
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,240
I can't repay you for what you've done today.

95
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,950
If the Divine Flame Villa ever needs help,

96
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,360
I, Yan Rushan, will surely

97
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,920
do anything to help.

98
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,790
Don't stand on ceremony.

99
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,720
Time is limited.

100
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:07,870
Hurry up.

101
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,790
Don't worry.

102
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,910
I promised you

103
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,710
I wouldn't try to break free again.

104
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,080
I missed you so much.

105
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,750
I'm sorry.

106
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,410
I don't want to hear you say sorry.

107
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,460
I'm sure time will pass quickly.

108
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:20,960
A hundred years is just

109
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,410
a blink of an eye.

110
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,300
But as each day passes,

111
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,630
a hundred years is a lifetime

112
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,110
for you humans.

113
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,860
Don't wait for me anymore.

114
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,250
Let's go to the Grief Tree

115
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,000
and retract our vows.

116
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,470
Let's...

117
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:03,970
Let's just pretend

118
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,720
we never met.

119
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,220
I disagree.

120
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,990
I, Lyu Jianwen, have the final say in my relationship.

121
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,790
No one can make decisions for me.

122
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,370
Including you.

123
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,870
If you really care about me,

124
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,910
you should be urging me

125
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,290
to strengthen my body

126
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,920
and practice cultivation well.

127
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,350
Maybe I'll be able to wait for you

128
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,620
to come back in a hundred years.

129
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,280
Why are you so silly?

130
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,800
No matter what,

131
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,300
I'll never leave you.

132
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,840
Okay.

133
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,080
I promise you.

134
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,010
If you change your mind now,

135
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,050
it's not too late to

136
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,620
[Snow Mountain]

137
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,950
return to Huntian Prison.

138
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,930
Although we got you the chance

139
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,230
to be imprisoned here,

140
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,510
this place snows all year round,

141
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,260
and has no sign of anyone else.

142
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,310
Also, the ice prison is so cold.

143
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,460
If you stay here,

144
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:11,480
you will have to endure loneliness and suffering for 100 years.

145
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,010
I choose to stay here.

146
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,570
Have you made up your mind?

147
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,870
You used up almost all your spirit power

148
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,080
when you helped Lyu Jianwen dispel Cold Magic.

149
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,430
If you insist on being trapped here for hundreds of years,

150
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,360
you'll definitely hurt your body.

151
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,790
I want to watch her from here,

152
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,360
even if

153
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,410
she'll never remember me again.

154
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,340
What's wrong with my heart?

155
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:03,670
Maybe...

156
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,670
I now know that there is someone that I have to remember

157
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,800
and protect even if I have to die for it.

158
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,260
If two people love each other,

159
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,700
what's there to fear about suffering and hardship?

160
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,610
Maybe I can use another way

161
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,680
to put all of them at ease.

162
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,160
How is this possible?

163
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,370
There's a new Love Seed in your body.

164
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,390
When I was checking you out,

165
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,480
I discovered

166
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,380
a Tear of Love in the corner of your heart.

167
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,360
It is under the nourishment of this tear that

168
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,160
the Love Seed can be reborn with blood in your body.

169
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,510
Tear of Love?

170
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,940
It's precisely this tear that aroused love in your heart.

171
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,270
And your recent heartaches

172
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,750
is due to the fact that as your love grows,

173
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,030
the Love Seed gets bigger and pierces through your heart and blood.

174
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,230
It then causes the painful heartaches.

175
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,150
Impossible.

176
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,550
The act of sacrificing my Love Seed

177
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,200
is achieved by using my heart as a medium.

178
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,600
As long as my heart and the magic is in place,

179
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,390
my heart

180
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,440
can never bear a Love Seed.

181
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,600
You're right.

182
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,660
So,

183
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,440
when this Love Seed matures,

184
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,300
or in other words, when it blooms,

185
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,110
it will wither because of the Sacrificial Magic in your heart.

186
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,040
By then,

187
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,510
you will forget the one you love again.

188
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,170
Unless you fall in love again,

189
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,570
and the Love Seed is reborn again.

190
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,360
But after such repeated damage,

191
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,960
you'll die of heart failure.

192
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,120
Honghong.

193
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:39,170
You must not take any chances this time.

194
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,600
Don't tell anyone about this yet.

195
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,670
I actually forgot.

196
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,330
She doesn't remember me anymore.

197
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,790
This is the wine

198
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:09,010
made by Lyu Jianwen herself.

199
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,650
It's still the same smell.

200
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,550
If I could,

201
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,250
I'd like to get really drunk.

202
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,170
In my dream,

203
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,840
I'm still a thief,

204
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,630
and she's still a constable.

205
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,550
Since you love her so much,

206
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,280
why must you let her forget you?

207
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,770
You don't understand.

208
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,720
Yes, I don't.

209
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,720
But I know

210
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,700
it doesn't feel good to be in love with

211
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,640
someone who has forgotten who you are.

212
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,569
Since I can't be with day and night,

213
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,410
I will watch over her from afar

214
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,490
until we grow old.

215
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,400
This is the only way

216
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,880
I can stay with her.

217
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,180
Must my silly disciple

218
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,750
see Lyu Jianwen marry someone else

219
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,350
before he could feel at ease?

220
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,600
He wants to see her happy.

221
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,090
That's good too.

222
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:09,620
They do as per their own wishes for each other.

223
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,800
Even if they can't get together,

224
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,050
their hearts are connected.

225
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,260
I heard this wine was made by her father

226
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,350
when Lyu Jianwen was born.

227
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:13,130
It's been buried under the tree in front of their house.

228
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,350
I know.

229
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,920
I saw her

230
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,440
dig the wine out from under the tree.

231
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,650
That man met and fell in love with her.

232
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,660
He fixed the latrine under the scorching sun,

233
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,480
and buried the birds they couldn't save with her.

234
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,720
Sometimes,

235
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:37,680
they would even work together on cases for ordinary people.

236
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,350
She has someone by her side

237
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,720
to enjoy the four seasons together,

238
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,910
and experience the hardships of the world.

239
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:51,780
This is the life

240
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,230
she was meant to live.

241
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:57,400
She's...

242
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,570
She's happy, right?

243
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,880
♫The falling leaves♫

244
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,640
♫Land on autumn grass♫

245
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,890
♫Who knocked on my heart again♫

246
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,600
♫I look back a thousand times♫

247
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:48,640
♫At the most unbearable sincerity♫

248
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,760
♫Waiting for you to ask♫

249
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:54,800
♫Let the warmth linger even for a moment♫

250
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:58,220
♫My yearning descends from the sky♫

251
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:01,440
♫Turning into countless whispers♫

252
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:07,370
♫I wipe away your tears with a piece of night sky♫

253
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,250
♫The past is always the same♫

254
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,780
♫I've heard of the jokes in the streets♫

255
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:21,190
♫How deep can this love carve into the wood♫

256
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:24,440
♫The red leaves set us ablaze♫

257
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,700
♫The snow drains our warmth♫

258
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,920
♫We keep parting and loving each other again♫

259
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,640
I, Yan Rushan,

260
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,920
♫Living life like a dream♫

261
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,070
vow to share

262
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,690
♫My heart and mind are always conflicting♫

263
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,240
weal and woe

264
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,020
with Lyu Jianwen.

265
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:41,510
♫I have passed by so many people♫

266
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,740
I will never break my promise.

267
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,330
♫All that is left♫

268
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:48,450
♫Is my reflection in your eyes♫

269
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,220
I've remembered.

270
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,080
I, Lyu Jianwen, vow to

271
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,710
be with Yan Rushan

272
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,240
for the rest of my life,

273
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,310
till death do us part.

274
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,720
Do you think I can live happily

275
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,360
if I forget you?

276
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,400
More than the pain of separation,

277
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,160
I'm more afraid of

278
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,640
losing the right to love you.

279
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,060
Thank you for helping, Chief.

280
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,080
That day, it was you who

281
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,380
put a spell on the Serene Amber Horn,

282
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,100
which then blocked the Sorrow-Oblivion Spell.

283
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,040
And when he was drunk,

284
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,660
you took a wisp of his aura,

285
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,690
and morphed it into his appearance,

286
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,720
in order for us to have this wedding today.

287
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,040
This is also what he wants to see.

288
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,590
Do you feel happy?

289
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,490
It's also a kind of blessing to have someone

290
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,840
to think about and remember.

291
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,770
Is it worth loving someone you can't be together with

292
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,270
for your entire life?

293
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,280
Love is love.

294
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,990
There's no such thing as worth it or not.

295
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,610
If you've decided to be with someone,

296
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,830
as long as you know there is

297
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:38,310
this other person in this world,

298
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,640
you won't feel lonely

299
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:42,030
even if you can't be together.

300
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,770
Instead, you'll feel happy all the time.

301
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,720
Do those memories I can't remember

302
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,870
belong to him?

303
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,680
I think I understand now

304
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,570
why Lyu Jianwen don't want to forget.

305
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,200
It turns out that

306
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,880
it's the most painful to forget.

307
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:16,540
Maybe I should give myself a chance

308
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:19,910
and give him a chance.

309
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:25,590
Sorry.

310
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,270
I am still late.

311
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:30,720
I couldn't witness their wedding with you.

312
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:32,540
You're not late.

313
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,190
You came just in time.

314
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:38,790
Although I've been in charge of the spirit clan for hundreds of years,

315
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,590
it was the first time I got to know

316
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,650
the power of love can be so strong.

317
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,880
It can make one not fear life and death,

318
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,200
time,

319
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,760
and loneliness.

320
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,960
If there's someone who loves you

321
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,030
and misses you,

322
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,680
you won't feel lonely even if you

323
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:58,220
are at a cold, desolate place all by yourself.

324
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,310
In this regard,

325
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,920
I envy Yan Rushan instead.

326
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,590
Compared to

327
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,560
having you remember who I am,

328
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,280
I'd rather be by your side more.

329
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,720
I'm sorry.

330
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,850
I forgot the past after

331
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,380
I sacrificed my Love Seed.

332
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,120
Can you patiently tell me

333
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,360
everything about our past?

334
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,880
Sure!

335
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,190
There were many things

336
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,140
that happened between us.

337
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,580
Which part do you want to hear?

338
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,330
It's okay if you don't know where to start.

339
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,270
I think...

340
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:55,750
I've fallen in love with you all over again.

341
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:17,270
If one day,

342
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,630
I forget about you again,

343
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,550
make me fall in love

344
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,580
with you again, no matter what.

345
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,110
Again and again,

346
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,450
until it's impossible to forget.

347
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,700
[Lyu Jianwen, Yan Rushan]

348
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,510
So this divine mission

349
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,360
had to be accomplished in such a way.

350
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,160
Grief Tree must know

351
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:57,690
they truly love each other.

352
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,310
When this Love Seed becomes mature,

353
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:02,170
or in other words, when it blooms,

354
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,960
it will wither because of the Sacrificial Magic in your heart.

355
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,790
By then,

356
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:08,360
you will forget the one you love again.

357
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:19,940
[Yuechu]

358
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,060
This way,

359
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,900
I'll never forget.

360
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:27,720
He's here.

361
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,890
I was supposed to wait for you.

362
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,890
I didn't expect to keep you waiting.

363
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,210
Is it not nice of me

364
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,610
to wait for you?

365
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:09,130
No, it's nice.

366
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:11,590
Before this,

367
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,200
I thought I would only get to see you

368
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,370
when I am all old and wrinkly.

369
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,860
I didn't expect

370
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,860
I would have so much time to be with you.

371
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,300
What surprises me more is

372
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,660
there comes a day where

373
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,190
I can make you wait for me.

374
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,290
It's my fault.

375
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,600
If you really feel guilty,

376
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,770
then promise me that

377
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,720
you'd always wait for me in the future,

378
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,480
will you?

379
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,220
Just kidding.

380
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,160
I'll wait for you.

00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:46,930
Lanterns for sale.

382
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,270
Lanterns!

383
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,400
Lanterns!

384
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:51,960
Wait for me.

385
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,920
Lanterns for sale! Come and have a look.

386
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,630
Why did I come here?

387
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:25,990
Yuechu?

388
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,820
Who is Yuechu?

389
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:38,820
Look.

390
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:16,820
You little brat.

391
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,200
I've made myself clear before.

392
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,160
Why do you still insist?

393
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:27,340
There are many things in this world

394
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:31,090
that can't be solved with just a few slices of watermelon.

395
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,860
I don't want Honghong to leave me.

396
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,590
And I don't want to put her through pain

397
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,050
or even endanger her life.

398
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,340
The love I give her

399
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,490
should be sweet.

400
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,350
So...

401
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,310
Lai,

402
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:52,310
Yaya.

403
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,770
Please fulfil my wish.

404
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,480
If he insists,

405
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,160
then let's fulfil it.

406
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:08,960
If it weren't for

407
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,270
your love for Honghong,

408
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,400
I'd have already...

409
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,050
There is only one solution to this problem,

410
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:23,980
and no one has ever tried it before.

411
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:28,940
By cutting half of your heart and congealing your Love Seed,

412
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,240
if there ever comes a day where she no longer loves you,

413
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,270
your heart

414
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:35,490
will wither to death.

415
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:55,600
By cutting half of your heart and congealing your Love Seed,

416
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:58,710
if there ever comes a day where she no longer loves you,

417
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,310
your heart

418
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,580
will wither to death.

419
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:10,350
Although I've been in charge of the spirit clan for hundreds of years,

420
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:12,150
it was the first time I got to know

421
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:14,170
the power of love can be so strong.

422
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,440
It can make one not fear life and death,

423
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:18,490
time,

424
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,180
and loneliness.

425
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,150
I think...

426
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,000
I've fallen in love with you all over again.

427
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,880
I'm willing

428
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,230
to give you my heart.

429
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:09,860
Lady Fairy,

430
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:13,160
you will never forget me again.

431
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,550
Who is calling me?

432
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:29,840
He is...

433
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:32,370
the one I don't want to forget.

434
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:35,650
Who is he exactly?

435
00:33:58,610 --> 00:33:59,610
It's sprouting.

436
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:16,929
Honghong.

437
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,040
From now on,

438
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,600
your heart will no longer be barren.

439
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:41,679
Honghong.

440
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:58,350
Yuechu.

441
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:02,170
I heard it.

442
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,440
From now on,

443
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,420
you're the only one

444
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:08,140
in my heart.

445
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,700
I'll take

446
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,630
your Feathered Flower.
