Jin Renfeng has many disciples.

5
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,070
I'm afraid he'll find us soon.

6
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,870
He's like a frightened bird now.

7

He won't dare to appear.

8
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,480
As long as I can get to Divine Flame Villa successfully,

9
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,210
I'll have a way to deal with him.

Do you really think that my nose is useless?

14
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Dongfang Yuechu,

15
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,630
you took away someone from Divine Flame Villa without permission.

16
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,240
It's an unforgiveable crime.

17
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,590
If you still see yourself as someone from Tushan,

18

obediently return with Chief

19

Now you know how cunning humans are.

28
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,920
We shouldn't have shown mercy toward him.

29

Oh no, Elder.

Why don't you rest in my pharmacy?

Jin Renfeng is paranoid.

If we want to lure him out, we can only use Fu Kui.

Why would I be tired?

I'm more than happy

116

to be able to guard Tushan every day.

117
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,800
That seems to make sense,

118

but if that's the case,

119
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,670
why are you still pulling a long face?

120
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,720

Oh no.

131
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,929
No, I have to find Honghong.

132

It's to cheer you up.

Where is the treasure bag?

139
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,440
Why can't I find it?

140
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,810
What's wrong?

141
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,020
It's just Guoguo.

142
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,250
Don't you think

143
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,930
Guoguo is a little strange recently?

144
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,010
First, his cultivation level increased.

145
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,550
Then, he keeps disappearing.

146
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,920
Also, Guoguo wasn't with us

147

when Princess Bu Tai was assassinated

148
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,250
that day in Beishan.

149
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,320
What do you mean?

150
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,790
I saved him myself.

151
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,790
Yes, he's a bit weird,

152
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,870
but that's because he was hurt before

153
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,200
and it traumatized him.

154
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,200
That's also why

155
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,910
he's a bit attached to me.

156
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,700
He would never associate with evil spirits.

157
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,310
But Yaya—

158
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,040
I don't want to hear it. Stop it.

159
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,120
Are you really angry?

160
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,790
Let go.

161
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:55,480
Well,

162
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,480
didn't you say you want to learn ice magic techniques?

163
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,320
If you ignore me,

164
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,510
I'll go find Yuechu.

165
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,270
He's been pestering me these days

166
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,470
to get me to teach him.

167
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,390
Wait.

168
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,670
Tell me.

169

for ice magic?

171
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,780
Listen carefully.

172
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,710

[Divine Flame Villa]

174
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,740
Why are you here?

175
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,700
You're finally awake.

176
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,150
You...

177
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,210
What do you want?

178
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,350
We don't want to do anything.

179
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,630
We just want to get close to you.

180
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,960
After all,

181
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,020
you're a veteran of Divine Flame Villa, right?

182
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,600
Yes.

183
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,550
Mr. Yuechu, we're on the same side.

184
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,550
Let's talk it out.

185
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:05,480
Let's talk it out.

186
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,480
Let's talk it out.

187
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:07,750
Then tell me

188
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,520
where your master is.

189
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,740
I don't know.

190
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,640
I really don't know.

191
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,790
You don't know?

192
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,880
If you don't,

193
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,320
then let me help you think about it.

194
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,410
Think about it.

195
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,920
Do you remember now?

196
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,790
Sister,

197
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:37,670
save me!

198
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,480
Save me!

199
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,960
Sister?

200
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,270
Now you remember that I'm your sister.

201
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,280
When you gave me to Jin Renfeng

202
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,760
to be his blood bag,

203
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,480
when Jin Renfeng poisoned me

204
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,840
and when he beat me,

205
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,330
why didn't you say that I was your sister?

206
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,610
Sister,

207
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,290
no.

208
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,150
I was blinded before.

209
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:57,910
I was wrong.

210
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,870
Forgive me this time.

211
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:01,070
From now on, we will be loving siblings.

212
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,030
No, no, no.

213
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,150
I'll tell you.

214
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,620
I'll tell you.

215
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,070
Elder,

216
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:21,960
we've searched

217
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,550
this forest three times already,

218
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,000
but we haven't seen anyone.

219
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,720
Shouldn't we go somewhere else?

220
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,780
This brat actually released poison,

221
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,300
making me lose my sense of smell.

222
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,750
We have to keep looking.

223
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:44,790
Lady Fairy,

224
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,700
the plan is going well.

225
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,800
Go wait for the good news at Divine Flame Villa.

226
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,120
Who were you messaging?

227
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,500
None of your business.

228
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,640
What are you doing?

229
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,670
You seem reasonable usually.

230
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,200
Why is your temper so short?

231
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,520
Don't think I don't know.

232
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,530
You were obviously

233
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,870
messaging that female spirit from Tushan.

234
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,100
You even said you're getting chased by Tushan

235
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,580
because you saved me.

236
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,110
It's obviously a lie.

237
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,050
What female spirit of Tushan?

238
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,640
Lady Fairy has a name.

239
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,270
Her name is Tushan Honghong.

240
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,910
Besides, it's none of your business if I lied to you or not.

241
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,600
As long as I can get you back safely

242
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,000
to the villa as promised,

243
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,120
we're even.

244
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,630
Let's go. Don't delay our business.

245
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,970
We're not even just because you say so.

246
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,320
We haven't settled the fact that you lied to me.

247
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,630
Master,

248
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,440
I brought him here.

249
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,120
Uncle Jin Mian,

250
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,000
how have you been?

251
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:32,620
[Divine Flame Villa]

252
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:25,600
Chief,

253
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,150
since we’ve found where that pig Jin Renfeng is,

254
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,750
why didn't you just kill him,

255
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,460
instead of going this roundabout way

256
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,820
and using that brat?

257
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,490
Jin Renfeng killed Yuechu's parents.

258
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:38,000
He must avenge them himself.

259
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,620
But this brat has always been cunning.

260
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,090
What if there's a trap?

261
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,480
I don't think so.

262
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,630
Yuechu has a lively personality,

263
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,630
but since he discussed this matter

264
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,960
with Chief,

265
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,630
he shouldn't break his promise.

266
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,270
Shut up.

267
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,530
What do you know?

268
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,960
What if he uses that pig Jin Renfeng as bait

269
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,110
to lure us here

270
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,690
and catch us all?

271
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,290
Based on your opinion,

272
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,200
how about we go back now?

273
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:06,720
No need.

274
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,360
I've been in the six realms for years.

275
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm not afraid of a newcomer.

276
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,080
Since we're already here,

277
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,390
how can we go back?

278
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,370
Even if it's dangerous,

279
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,180
I will forge through.

280
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,000
Who are you?

281
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,960
How dare you break into the Divine Flame Villa?

282
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,630
Tell that bastard Dongfang Yuechu

283
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,480
to come out!

284
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,090
Who are you?

285
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,430
You brat,

286
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:37,120
I'll show you who I am today.

287
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,590
Elder,

288
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,600
can't you fix your bad temper?

289
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,860
I could hear you yelling from miles away.

290
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,770
You...

291
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,030
You thief!

292
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,960
I haven't punished you yet,

293
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,290
but you've started to lecture me instead.

294
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,270
If you hadn't been ungrateful

295
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,390
and betrayed us,

296
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,930
I wouldn't be yelling.

297
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,910
Yes, Old Fox.

298
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,150
I'll apologize to you right now.

299
00:16:59,150 --> 00:16:59,870
Apologize?

300
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,960
Pig Jin Renfeng?

301
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,109
What do you think?

302
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,720
How about this gift?

303
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,680
Yuechu, good job.

304
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,030
Hey!

305
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,120
Jin Renfeng,

306
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,080
you deserve this ending.

307
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,270
You old witch.

308
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,440
Arrest these spirits!

309
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,920
What should we do?

310
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,780
That's Tushan Honghong.

311
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,720
What are you looking at?

312
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,550
Do it!

313
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,550
It's him.

314
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,720
It's Jin Renfeng.

315
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,710
He forced me to do all this.

316
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,880
It has nothing to do with me.

317
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,240
Fu Kui, you ungrateful traitor!

318
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,170
Jin Renfeng,

319
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,010
a wise man submits to fate.

320
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,550
Didn't you say that to us

321
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,280
when you killed the old master?

322
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,640
How cruel,

323
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,470
my cold-faced uncle.

324
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,310
Dongfang Yuechu,

325
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,960
I fell into your hands today

326
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,640
because the heavens wouldn't help me,

327
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,780
not because you're stronger than me.

328
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:41,070
Dongfang family members are born with spiritual blood.

329
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,930
You only have to practice a little

330
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,330
to become an expert.

331
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,030
Power and wealth

332
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,780
are at the tip of your fingers.

333
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,780
But I, Jin Renfeng,

334
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,990
was nameless.

335
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,610
Even after cultivating day and night

336
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,400
these past few decades

337
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,550
without daring to slack off,

338
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,070
in the end,

339
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,170
I'm just the acting master of a villa.

340
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,320
Even the heavens won't help me.

341
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:10,640
Jin Renfeng,

342
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:15,160
20 years ago, you killed my grandfather

343
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,900
and forced my mother into desperation.

344
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,200
When you forced her to watch

345
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,500
as her closest relative died

346
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,460
and be unable to go home,

347
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,170
have you ever thought that one day,

348
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,450
everything would backfire

349
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,170
onto yourself?

350
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,680
If you must,

351
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,810
blame that old thing for being hypocritical.

352
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,310
If he really thought highly of me before,

353
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,440
why didn't he marry his daughter to me?

354
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:39,110
That's why you forcefully took her?

355
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,960
Unfortunately, what's not yours will never be yours.

356
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,550
Even if you work tirelessly,

357
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,440
in the end,

358
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,440
you still have to return it all.

359
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,790
You said so much.

360
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:53,920
Don't you

361
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,890
just want to be

362
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:59,300
the Master of the Divine Flame Villa?

363
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,820
Who said I wanted to be the Master?

364
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,630
I don’t care about that.

365
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,120
But you...

366
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,530
You don't deserve it.

367
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,130
Jin Renfeng!

368
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,880
You're cunning and despicable.

369
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,750
You were acquitted several times before.

370
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,550
Now,

371
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,050
we have the evidence and witnesses.

372
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,580
What else do you want to say?

373
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,730
Everyone here, listen.

374
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,100
Jin Renfeng has repeatedly violated the rules of the alliance.

375
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,230
From today onwards,

376
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:39,390
Jin Renfeng is expelled from the Yiqi Alliance

377
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,900
and will be punished by Dongfang Yuechu.

378
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:48,510
Okay.

379
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:54,270
Jin Renfeng killed his master, usurped the position, and killed his fellow disciples.

380
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,880
How should he be punished

381
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:59,040
according to the Divine Flame Villa's rules?

382
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,770
Burn and destroy his meridians until death.

383
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,410
Today,

384
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,380
I will use my grandfather's sword

385
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,030
to help him cleanse his sect.

386
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,350
This sword strike

387
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,110
is for you to taste

388
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,910
the pain of my grandfather having his blood drawn.

389
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,350
This sword strike

390
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:50,230
is for the pain Aunt Yu Ping suffered these years.

391
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:55,370
Next...

392
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,720
This is to avenge my parents.

393
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,120
Back then, you were homeless.

394
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,030
My grandfather saved you.

395
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,100
He took you in as his disciple and taught you well.

396
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:10,910
The heavens

397
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,890
treated you well with this.

398
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,840
Tough and hardworking,

399
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,720
you could have established your own career,

400
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,250
but you were not satisfied.

401
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,680
You brought

402
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,360
all of this upon yourself.

403
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,750
By the way,

404
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,110
shouldn't you have a taste

405
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,550
of the Divine Flame you tried so hard to steal?

406
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,030
Jin Renfeng,

407
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,140
you've committed more than these crimes.

408
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,750
Jin Renfeng,

409
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,150
back then,

410
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,990
you lied and used Xiaotan's feelings

411
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,390
to make her steal blood

412
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,140
before killing her cruelly.

413
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,200
Today,

414
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,270
I will personally remove the spiritual blood

415
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,400
in your body for her.

416
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,060
No.

417
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,610
This medicine was made by the leech spirit's blood.

418
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:31,890
It can help people who lost blood to produce blood quickly.

419
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:32,650
But

420
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:34,900
it'll be your own blood.

421
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,010
From now on,

422
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,640
you will be a Flame Immortal without a Divine Flame.

423
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,160
No.

424
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,610
Jin Renfeng,

425
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,810
don't be afraid.

426
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,330
I won't kill you.

427
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:53,400
Twenty years ago, you were just a beggar.

428
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,420
I will release you back to the streets

429
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,400
and make you wish you were dead.

430
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,760
I want you to think about

431
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,280
what you have done wrong all these years.

432
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:18,280

There are still many matters to settle.

I'm afraid you two will have to handle them.

484

But Jin Renfeng has been expelled.

485
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:04,380
Don’t you want to return to Divine Flame Villa?

486
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:07,450
Is it because Tushan Honghong refuses to let you go?

487
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,050
It has nothing to do with her.

488
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,810
I punished Jin Renfeng

489

to seek justice.

490
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,200
I have no ties

491
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,960
for Divine Flame Villa.

492
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,240
But the villa needs a master.

493
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:19,610
You—

494
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:21,160
Who said there's no master?

495
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,010
Aunt Yu Ping, with your status and skills,

496
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,630
you're the best candidate for the villa's elder.

497
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,310
Besides,

498
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,330
Fu Cheng can lead the disciples

499
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:30,420
as a senior.

500
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,370
The villa will only get better.

501
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,440
Mr. Yuechu.

502
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,340
Butler Fei,

503
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,600
what are you doing here?

504
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,730
All these years,

505
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,650
Master has always wanted to get rid of Jin Renfeng

506
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:48,610
to avenge Madam Huaizhu and Divine Flame Villa,

507
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,520
but Jin Renfeng was cunning.

508
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,570
We couldn't do anything

509
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,160
without solid proof.

510
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,050
Forget about Jin Renfeng.

511
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:00,670
I'd like to ask how Director Wangquan

512
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:03,530

will manage the Divine Flame Villa.

Is there anything wrong with this?

So, has Wangquan Villa gathered enough money

520
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,220
to redeem me from Tushan?

521

You don't plan to return to Divine Flame Villa?

to have their own ideas.

At worst, old folks like you and I

00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,680
will have to work for a bit longer.

528

My mother had been

a playful glutton since childhood.

Your mother was indeed optimistic.

Even when something happened,

532
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,530
she remained open-minded.

533
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,540
She liked to brag too.

When I was little,

Why would I?

to ask for forgiveness from the Spirit Lord.
