Yuechu.

8
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,630
Passed!

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,840
Bravo! Bravo!

Since you have betrayed Tushan,

14
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,100
why did you come to us?

15
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,000
If you hate me for being a traitor,

16

why did you come to see me compete?

but it's permanent.

21

And it's fine if it's permanent, but you are missing a stroke here.

22

What are you trying to do?

23
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,120
Well then, when we're back at Tushan,

24
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,180
I'll add that missing stroke for you.

25
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,640
That depends on whether you are still alive.

26
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,710
After what you did today,

27
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,329
many people will definitely come after you.

28
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,910
That would be best.

29
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,450
I chose to join the alliance tryout

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,060
because I want more people to know me,

31
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,070
and that includes those who want to come after me.

32
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,070
Why?

33
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:29,810
Because I need fame.

34
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,690
A lot of fame at that.

35
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,960
I didn't expect you to be so vain.

36
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,560
In my opinion, I think

37
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,190
Yuechu just wants more people

38
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,560
to hear his voice.

39
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,000

hear and believe me.

44
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,480
Only then can I try to make the human race stronger.

45
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,000
And only when the human race becomes stronger

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,330
can the fear and suspicion of the spirit clan be eliminated.

47
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,430
Only then,

48
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,960
will there be true peace between humans and spirits.

49
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,560
So, does that mean you purposely left Tushan

50
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,840
in order to join the Yiqi Alliance?

51
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,350
You might hope for everyone to have their own magic tool.

52
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,190
But have you ever considered that

53
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,450
peace between humans and spirits might be too difficult to achieve?

54
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,850
I have to try regardless.

60
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,670
it was not all for naught.

61

Yeah.

62
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,820
I didn't expect that brat's insistence on going down the mountain

63
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,150
was for the sake of the humans and spirits.

64
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,510
Just now, he broke free from the fox spell.

65
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,750
That's not easy.

66
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,920
That ungrateful fox.

67
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,560
If it weren't for the crowd at the recruitment rally,

68
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,390
I would have knocked him out.

69
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,600
It was a good thing that Yuechu was skillful enough

70
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,200
and didn't get caught by him.

71
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,590
Of course.

72
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,560
You got to look at who he learnt his magic from.

73
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,750
Oh, right.

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,330
Who did he learn it from?

75
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,310
I recall someone groaning every day,

76
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,190
saying that she would never

77
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,450
teach magic to a human.

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,870
Who was it?

79
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,750
That was in the past.

80
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,600
Now, he had gone to such great lengths

81
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,450
for the sake of Tushan

82
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,650
and my sister.

83
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,740
I really regret

84
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,510
not teaching him all my magic.

85
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,920
Well, what I remembered was that he had actually learnt it all.

86
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,920
And that gourd.

87
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,240
When did he take it away

88
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,600
to write nonsense on it?

89
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,050
I...

90
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,320
That's because I went easy on him.

91
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,750
Anyway, he's just not as good as me.

92
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,260

97
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,350
if she sees how devoted that brat was.

98
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,770
Your sister wouldn't.

As a friend,

101
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,510
I certainly don't want your sister

102
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,040
to sacrifice her feelings.

103
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,020
But she is not only your sister,

104

but also Yuechu's lover,

105

and my friend.

106
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,500
She is also the chief of Tushan,

107

and the Head of Spirit Alliance.

108
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,120
Given her position,

109
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,520
she must bear its weight.

110
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,780
That is her duty and the price of being

111

a powerful person.

112
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,040

115
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,730
you'll naturally understand.

When I first came to Tushan,

117
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,230
I really hoped you could understand this earlier.

118

No, I want to understand.

121
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,390
Then, I can help share

most of the problems are centered at Beishan.

236
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,390
It should be because Beishan is in the desert.

237

With a greater temperature difference between day and night,

Exactly.

244
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,670
You just have to add an insulating layer inside the magic tool.

00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:05,930
As long as you use your spirit power, you'll be in excruciating pain.

341
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,270
Someone is here.

342
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,680
Honghong.

343
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,270
Keep an eye on those two foxes.

344
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:54,920
Yes.

345
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,130
Do you really think

346
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,480
I'll be fooled by you again?

347
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,590
My power is weak.

348
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,570
I have no means to save you directly.

349
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:20,570
So I had no choice but to cooperate with my senior

350
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,280
in order to gain his trust.

351
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,370
I believe

352
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:29,240
there will come one day

353
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:36,920
where humans and spirits can live in harmony.

354
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,240
I'm sorry.

355
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,800
I didn't tell you who I was back then,

356
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,790
resulting

357
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,670
in your misunderstanding.

358
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,090
Back then, I only wanted to save...

359
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,240
I've already known.

360
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:31,910
I'm sorry.

361
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,920
I was being rude.

362
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,140
I just...

363
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:37,570
You've been in a coma for hundreds of years,

364
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,460
and have just woken up.

365
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,610
It's only natural that you're unable

366
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,820
to adapt to the changes around you.

367
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,510
You've changed a lot

368
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,040
since then too.

369
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,350
Now that you're awake,

370
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,720
what's your plan?

371
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,310
After lying around for so long,

372
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,750
I'm afraid it'll be hard to

373
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,960
integrate back into the human race.

374
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,110
If it's convenient,

375
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,510
let me stay here

376
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:02,880
and be accompanied by books and chess

377
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,140
for the rest of my life.

378
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,880
It's fine if it's inconvenient.

379
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,070
The six realms are huge.

380
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,310
There's always room for me.

381
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,170
I don't need much on my own anyway.

382
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:17,770
I owe you my life.

383
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,400
If you want to stay,

384
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,600
that's possible too.

385
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,240
I'll arrange a place for you.

386
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,110
Thank you,

387
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,880
but no need to bother.

388
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,790
I've been lying here for hundreds of years.

389
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,000
I'm used to this place,

390
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,200
so there's no need to move.

391
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,030
I wonder why did Sister called us over

392
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,240
so formally?

393
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,590
Yes.

394
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,660
I just roasted this chicken

395
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,350
and have yet to take a bite

396
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,120
when I received Chief's call.

397
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,310
Sister.

398
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,350
Sister.

399
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,000
This is...

400
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,440
Dongfang Luo.

401
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,840
-Dongfang Luo?
-Dongfang Luo?

402
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:06,810
You...

403
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,160
I often hear this name,

404
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,590
but it's my first time seeing you in person.

405
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,150
I'm Dongfang Luo. You're...

406
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,270
Tushan Yaya.

407
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,400
Tushan Rongrong.

408
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,600
Just call me Elder.

409
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,680
Greetings, Elder.

410
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,070
In the future,

411
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:27,510
Dongfang Luo will stay at the Twin Peaks of Tushan

412
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,170
and live alongside everyone.

413
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,120
He's staying in Tushan?

414
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:34,000
Chief, I don't think that's appropriate.

415
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,240
Although humans are allowed to stay in Tushan,

416
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,830
he's an outsider after all.

417
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,450
You have a point, Elder.

418
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,130
I'm causing inconvenience by staying behind in Tushan.

419
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:46,960
But there's no place for me in the human race.

420
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,210
So I shamelessly begged Honghong

421
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,850
to allow me to temporarily stay at Twin Peaks.

422
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,640
Deputy Chief, Third-Ranking Chief,

423
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,960
say something!

424
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,890
Dongfang Luo is the savior of Honghong and Rongrong.

425
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,590
I don't mind if he stays.

426
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:09,310
Things have been going well in Tushan.

427
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,770
The harvest has been good.

428
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:13,630
There's no problem in supporting one more person.

429
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,310
Elder,

430
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,240
what do you think?

431
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:17,890
I...

432
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,720
No objection.

433
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,960
This old fox completely agrees.

434
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:23,550
Well then, I'll go tell other fox spirits

435
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,410
to be polite when they meet Dongfang Luo.

436
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,750
They must not be rude.

437
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:28,840
Thank you.

438
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:29,790
You're welcome.

439
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:30,720
You're welcome.

440
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,140
Have you made up your mind?

441
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,690
Previously, I only studied scriptures and philosophies.

442
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:45,820
I knew nothing about actual practice.

443
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,660
Now that I've woken up, instead of indulging in empty talk,

444
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,750
I would rather study medicine

445
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,280
to save oneself and others.

446
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,240
Fine.

447
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:57,440
I'll ask Rongrong to prepare some medical books for you.

448
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,340
You're not familiar with this mountain.

449
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,350
Wherever you want to go,

450
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:02,550
you can ask the foxes to show you the way.

451
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,160
Thank you.

452
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,370
[Tushan]

453
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,250
There's none.

454
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,830
That is...

455
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,830
Chief has set rules.

456
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,700
No one can leave Tushan without permission.

457
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,310
Come back.

458
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,140
Sorry.

459
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,440
I was reckless.

460
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,440
May I ask...

461
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,540
is that village over there part of the human race's territory?

462
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,790
That place?

463
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,830
It's Hulu Village.

464
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,690
It's part of Tushan's territory.

465
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,680
There are indeed

466
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,260
humans living there.

467
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,400
There are humans?

468
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:56,960
Who is it?

469
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,280
An old friend of Tushan,

470
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,400
called Dongfang Yuechu.

471
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,460
I'll go back first.

472
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,790
Dongfang Yuechu?

473
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,070
It's him.

474
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,350
Savior!

475
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,680
Dongfang Luo?

476
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,580
You're awake?

477
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,130
Thank you for saving me.

478
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,510
I'll give you ten years of my vitality.

479
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,640
When did you wake up?

480
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,400
Does Honghong know?

481
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,550
I just woke up a few days ago.

482
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,210
Thanks to Honghong's kindness,

483
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:49,010
I can continue to stay in Tushan.

484
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,120
You want to stay in Tushan?

485
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:56,790
You came here

486
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,510
just to thank me?

487
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,800
I'm ashamed.

488
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,350
I knew I've been greatly indebted to you

489
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,750
back when I was in my soul.

490
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,000
However, I didn't see you when I woke up.

491
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,710
If I hadn't gone out to collect herbs,

492
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,380
and found the scent of you nearby,

493
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,330
I wouldn't have known when I could thank you personally.

494
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,240
Enough.

495
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:14,010
Stop calling me your savior.

496
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:14,800
I saved you

497
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,380
because of Honghong.

498
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,190
According to the human race,

499
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,770
I'm Honghong's sidekick,

500
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,310
and you are Honghong's friend.

501
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,780
So naturally, you are my friend.

502
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,580
It's only right to save a friend.

503
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,790
Friend?

504
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:26,350
Yes.

505
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:29,960
Dongfang Luo.

506
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,720
Let's be friends.

507
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:33,960
Sure.

508
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,700
It's your first time here.

509
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,830
I'll give you a gift.

510

The novella I recommended is good, right?

Let me tell you.

The fox spirits of Tushan are very difficult to deal with.

Just now,

at Dongfang family's library.

They've got a lot of different opinions within themselves.

Some people think it's the work of

the spirit clan from the Spirit Alliance.

650

Since there is no evidence,

why would anyone think it was done by the spirit clan?

was the Nangong Family of the Yiqi Alliance.

00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,040
I'll have some tea and leave.

680
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,230
Something new?

681
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,040
What is it?

682
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,190
Tell me.

683
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,650
I'll tell you if you beg me.

684
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:07,710
Never mind.

685
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:08,570
Just forget it.

686
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,670
Whatever.

687
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,840
Anyway,

688
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,800
many female disciples

689
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,960
from Yiqi Alliance went missing recently.

690
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,620
Everyone said it was Spirit Alliance behind it.

691
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,490
If it was Yiqi Alliance who had missing disciples...

692
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:27,440
Why do they insist that it was the work of Spirit Alliance?

693
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,190
I don't know the details.

694
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,970
But I heard...

695
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:33,800
it's the Nangong family creating the most noise.

696
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,800
Nangong Shi?

697
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:39,760
By the way,

698
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,040
these are the information you asked me to collect

699
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,720
[Nangong]

700
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,920
on the various aristocrats of Yiqi Alliance over the past three years.

701
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,320
I've brought it all over.

702
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,030
You're smart.

703
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,230
As expected, it was Nangong Shi

704
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:07,360
who instructed those people to target Spirit Alliance.

705
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,760
I've been running around

706
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,000
to gather the things you've asked for.

707
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,110
I wonder if you would fulfil

708
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,170
your side of the promise, Sir.

709
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,190
Don't worry.

710
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,920
As long as the Nangong family

711
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,020
stick to the plan as discussed,

712
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,000
the position of Yiqi Alliance's director

713
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,530
would definitely be yours.

714
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,850
When did the Nangong family have such a nobleman?

715
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,110
Thank you, Sir.

716
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,880
This is not the only thing you have to thank me for.

717
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,140
About your father...

718
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,030
My lord,

719
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,550
a man outside claiming to be Yuechu wants to see you.

720
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:49,880
Dongfang Yuechu?

721
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,520
What is he doing here?

722
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:56,350
Although he's been showing off,

723
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:59,450
he has yet to officially take over Divine Flame Villa.

724
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,470
It seems...

725
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,680
he wants something from me.

726
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,960
Dongfang Yuechu?
