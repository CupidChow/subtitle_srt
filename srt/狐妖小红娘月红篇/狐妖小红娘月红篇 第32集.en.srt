Yaya.

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,650
I've checked everywhere.

7
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,710
Nothing unusual.

8
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,870
I wish I'd never get injured again.

9
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,070
Chief wouldn't let me go to Nanlin with her,

10
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,930
and you wouldn't let me go on patrol with you either.

11

Just concentrate on getting better.

The safety of the six realms

isn't the sole responsibility of Aolai Sanshao.

Everyone

18

should take responsibility for it.

19

Why are you writing this all of a sudden?

20

It's an appeal.

21
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,470

What's the big deal?

Then hit me again.

I can't bring myself to do it.

In the past,

39

I can let go,

139
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,640

how I should punish you today.

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,210
How about giving each of you ten slaps on the palm?

00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,480
No, Deputy Chief.

144

No! No!

146

There is another solution.

147
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,430
You can stay here and keep watching the show,

148
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,800
but you can't argue about being different again.

149
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,790
Not just today,

150
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,890
you can't be hostile towards each other anymore.

151

Forget the show.

153
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,020
Take all of them back.

154

00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,549
No, no, no.

156
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:35,880
We won't be hostile to each other anymore.

157

That's your own choice, right?

158
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:38,150
Yes.

159
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,990
Then, from now on,

160
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,480
if I catch anyone

161
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,800
starting trouble over human-spirit differences again,

162
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,560
they'll have me to answer to.

Of course.

there's nothing I can't do.

170

Stupid girl.

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,750
that the boy's name is Weisheng,

177
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,010
and they've known each other for a while.

178
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,600
Yeah.

179
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,310
It's too soon to propose marriage.

180
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,440
But since the boy is coming for a visit for the first time,

181
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,040
as Xia's mother, you should take it seriously.

182
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,210
Like hell I will!

183
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,520
Why weren't you so forward back then?

184
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,320
We had known each other forever.

185
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,270
Why didn't you come to my house and propose marriage?

186
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,740
Chun, I was wrong.

187
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,540
Do you mean it?

188
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,320
Yes. I was wrong.

189
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,960
Chun,

190
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,770
look,

191
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,090
both of us are old now.

192
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:56,720
Can we…

193
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,200
No way.

194
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,520
Between us,

195
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,310
nothing is gonna happen.

196
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,620
Chun.

197
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:04,970
Cut the crap.

198
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,790
I need to go train those tree spirits.

199
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,480
Before we find the Seven-Treasures Bark,

200
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,160
we must not let down our guard.

201
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,290
There's no rush.

202
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,860
The kids will be back soon.

203
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,960
As Xia's mother,

204
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,080
you can't be absent.

205
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,240
If I stayed,

206
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,900
I'd be indulging their whims.

207
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,510
Go away!

208
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,220
Chun.

209
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:23,870
Well…

210
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,140
We'll wait for you for dinner!

211
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,430
Like I care!

212
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:32,630
We'll wait for you.

213
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,460
What…

214
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:53,800
What do you like?

215
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,100
I mean,

216
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,450
is there anything

217
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,360
you really want or like?

218
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,540
I like…

219
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,840
I like everything about you.

220
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,020
I know how you feel about me.

221
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:18,440
But if I'm going to propose marriage, I don't think

222
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,040
I should go with empty hands.

223
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,630
My family doesn't care about that.

224
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,080
Wait, wait.

225
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,540
My family only cares about

226
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,480
your character.

227
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,220
Let's go.

228
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:29,980
Wait, wait.

229
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,750
I still should prepare something.

230
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,750
Wait for me here. I'll be right back.

231
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,750
Fool.

232
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,780
Where did you get so many eggs?

233
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,150
-You once mentioned that…
-Whatever. Let's go.

234
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,630
Wait, wait. Hold on.

235
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,010
You really want to marry me?

236
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,120
We just met.

237
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,780
-How about…
-What do you mean?

238
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,060
Don't get me wrong.

239
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,210
I know you're a good girl.

240
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,310
It's just that I'm poor,

241
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,720
timid, and incompetent.

242
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,320
Let's wait until…

243
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,840
I can't wait.

244
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,750
Or the guy…

245
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:18,550
The guy…

246
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,930
Actually,

247
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,000
guys who seem competent

248
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,240
but are actually arrogant and snobbish

249
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,570
are annoying in my eyes.

250
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,350
Really?

251
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,260
Yes. My mother once said

252
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,290
an able man

253
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,220
is a man who treats his woman well.

254
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:38,910
You treat me very well.

255
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,010
Let's go.

256
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,150
Come on.

257
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,080
Who are you?

258
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,160
Why are you in my house?

259
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,990
You're Xiaxia, right?

260
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,400
You look just like your mom.

261
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,240
What a disgusting and vulgar nickname.

262
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,000
How did you come up with it?

263
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,990
My mom

264
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,750
often talked about a guy called Jiaojiao

265
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,210
who was short-tempered and narrow-minded.

266
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,450
That's you, right?

267
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,480
That's what your mom said about me?

268
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,160
Not only that.

269
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,920
She even angrily cursed your name in her dreams.

270
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,630
It seems that Chun really hates me.

271
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,390
Sir,

272
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,100
I think it's because her mother missed you

273
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,170
that she often mentioned you.

274
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,550
You have a point.

275
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,520
You're Weisheng,

276
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,030
the guy Xia mentioned in her letter, right?

277
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,890
You seem like a good guy.

278
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,880
Wow, you brought a gift.

279
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,000
Sorry.

280
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,750
It's not an expensive gift,

281
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,790
but I…

282
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,440
It's fine.

283
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,210
Give it to me. It's great.

284
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,550
It's a great gift.

285
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,670
Let me tell you.

286
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,430
In a romantic relationship,

287
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,170
what matters is feelings.

288
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,390
You should take care of each other.

289
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,220
Spoil her a little bit.

290
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,610
Don't let her feel wronged or get hurt.

291
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,720
But I can see

292
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,930
that you're a kind and honest boy.

293
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,680
No wonder she's chosen you.

294
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,830
Did you prepare all these dishes?

295
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,380
Yeah…

296
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,090
No, no.

297
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,920
Your mom prepared them.

298
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:37,990
How's that possible?

299
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,400
She wouldn't even wait for me,

300
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,040
let alone prepare food for me.

301
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,910
Besides, she can't cook at all.

302
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,300
Forget it. It doesn't matter.

303
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,350
Since you're my mom's old lover,

304
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,950
I'll respect you as an elder.

305
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,020
Today,

306
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,000
you'll make the decision

307
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,770
for me and Weisheng.

308
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:06,550
Sir.

309
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,540
My name is Hu Weisheng.

310
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,200
I'm here today

311
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,240
to propose marriage to Ms. Xia.

312
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,130
For richer or for poorer,

313
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,960
for better or for worse,

314
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,370
I'll always be by her side

315
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,490
and protect her.

316
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,630
Great.

317
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,120
Great.

318
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:26,570
Xia.

319
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,900
If your mom hadn't left in a hurry to train those tree spirits,

320
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,410
she would agree too.

321
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:32,960
Tree spirits?

322
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,480
You're a spirit?

323
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:38,940
I…

324
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,480
Blood for blood!

325
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,100
Tree spirits killed people from the Ximen family.

326
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,240
I'll make you pay today.

327
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,490
Eldest Senior?

328
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,330
Don't be afraid. I'll protect you.

329
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,270
Xia.

330
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,190
I'll take care of them.

331
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,930
Go get your mom with Weisheng.

332
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,090
All three of you

333
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,610
have to die today.

334
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,710
Don't think about escaping!

335
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:25,670
Let's go!

336
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,490
A bunch of losers. You're dead.

337
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,210
The female robber?

338
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,700
It's really her.

339
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,040
Weisheng.

340
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,510
Xia, leave!

341
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,170
I'm just playing nice.

342
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,800
Don't take a fox for a kitten.

343
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,310
Come with me!

344
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,130
Be careful.

345
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:04,970
Gently.

346
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,720
It's strange.

347
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,660
How come those disciples were killed by tree spirits?

348
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,390
Is there another conflict between the two clans?

349
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,590
If so,

350
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:16,250
Chief Yueti should've informed us of it.

351
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,730
Now,

352
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,360
we need to find out Ximen Li's secret first.

353
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,210
Everything else can wait.

354
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,760
Tree spirits can go to hell.

355
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:29,690
They're so cruel.

356
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:30,370
Yeah.

357
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,900
Director Dongfang,

358
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:48,940
you've seen it.

359
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,010
Yueti Chun took revenge on me out of hate.

360
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,380
I only took three drops of blood from her,

361
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:57,080
yet she took six lives from the Ximen family.

362
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,070
How should I

363
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,800
settle this score with her?

364
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,980
It depends on you, Patriarch Ximen.

365
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,790
However,

366
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,910
aren't you going to meet me now?

367
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,700
Black Foxes.

368
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,150
Yuechu.

369
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,430
It's you.

370
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,000
Dongfang,

371
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,560
we meet again.

372
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,200
He's just a dead man.

373
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,240
Sometimes the truth

374
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,150
is not what you see.

375
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,240
If you want the truth,

376
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,140
come with me.

377
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:44,860
Yuechu.

378
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,750
Black Foxes took their primordial cores.

379
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,830
It's all Shi Ji's scheme.

380
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,090
She's killed Ximen Li.

381
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,300
As for Ximen Gong,

382
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,880
he's probably already controlled by the Dark Force.

383
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,960
I'll go after Shi Ji. Ximen Gong is at Nanlin.

384
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,290
Okay. I'll go to Nanlin.

385
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,400
Where do you live?

386
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,240
We need to tell your mom to save the old fox.

387
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,480
We caused such a ruckus.

388
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,640
She must've noticed it and is on her way back.

389
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,350
That old fox is an elder from Tushan.

390
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,410
Those Ximen scumbags can't hurt him.

391
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,480
What should we do now?

392
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,280
Keep running.

393
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,260
Okay.

394
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,610
Tushan Honghong.

395
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,270
The person you're after

396
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,840
is not here.

397
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,720
Humans

398
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,880
are the least reliable.

399
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,480
Do you think only you guys can use the fox spell?

400
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,110
Let me see how many more schemes you're hatching

401
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,590
through your vision.

402
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,770
Making the Tear of Void

403
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,930
will cost the cultivator all their vitality.

404
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,360
With the blood of a fox spirit,

405
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,750
the Black Fox can possess the fox spirit forever.

406
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,520
Fox spirit.

407
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,930
Three drops of Elder's blood?

408
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,290
Tushan Honghong.

409
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,520
You can never catch Black Foxes.

410
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,490
Oh, no.

411
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,030
Elder.

412
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,360
From the very beginning,

413
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:18,250
Tushan shouldn't have gotten involved in the mess at Nanlin.

414
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,610
Forget about Tushan and Nanlin.

415
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:25,400
It's all for the Spirit Alliance.

416
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,070
Take my advice.

417
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,450
Know your place and surrender now.

418
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,540
Don't force me to kill you.

419
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,560
Old fox,

420
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,750
you haven't seen war in hundreds of years

421
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,750
but are still such a good fighter.

422
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,130
You shouldn't have

423
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,740
chosen to side with Tushan Honghong back then.

424
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,880
Don't blame me for not showing you mercy.

425
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,030
Old fox!

426
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:36,910
Stop!

427
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,580
That spirit power…

428
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,640
It's the Black Fox.

429
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,510
Dongfang Yuechu,

430
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,360
watch carefully.

431
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:49,430
All the disciples of the Yiqi Alliance here

432
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:52,800
will die in front of you one by one today!

433
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,830
You're not Elder.

434
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:58,370
I took three drops of his blood

435
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,830
because we're both fox spirits

436
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,660
and I can use the blood to let the Black Fox possess him.

437
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,340
Only after he dies

438
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,860
can he be freed from the Black Fox.

439
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,480
Do you

440
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,030
have the guts to kill me?

441
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,440
Director.

442
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,240
Elder!

443
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:21,780
Elder!

444
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:22,830
Wake up!

445
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,310
Yuechu.

446
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:27,910
I can't hold on.

447
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:29,680
Dongfang Yuechu.

448
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,880
Between Tushan and the Yiqi Alliance,

449
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,240
which one will you choose?

450
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,000
Kill me.

451
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,920
Hate all you want. The more you hate me, the stronger I become.

452
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,970
Kill me!

453
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Or the Black Fox won't give up!

454
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,860
Elder!

455
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:45,650
Yes. Kill all the humans in the six realms!

456
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:00,900
-Director!
-Director!

457
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:05,090
Director, help me.

458
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,370
It's useless.

459
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:08,610
Dongfang Yuechu,

460
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,890
you won't kill me.

461
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,610
Just watch me kill everyone!

462
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,390
Yuechu, kill me now!

463
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:19,350
I have to die to be freed from the Black Fox's control.

464
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,750
If one day I commit sins against Tushan,

465
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,030
you must kill me.

466
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,880
Can you promise me?

467
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:47,590
No.

468
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,200
Can you promise me?

469
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,630
No.

470
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,330
Just promise me, will you?

471
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:59,370
Fine, fine. I promise you.

472
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,060
You annoying fox.

473
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:06,590
Good.

474
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,680
What a nice

475
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,000
stab!

476
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:28,630
Elder.

477
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,890
Sorry.

478
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,070
Elder.

479
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:39,960
Good boy.

480
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:42,710
Thank you.

481
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,960
Tushan didn't raise you for nothing.

482
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:49,320
Elder.

483
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:53,920
Elder.

484
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,140
You can't die.

485
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:57,340
You can't…

486
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,020
From now on,

487
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:01,530
Chief

488
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,350
and Tushan

489
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,380
will…

490
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,270
will be…

491
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,670
counting on…

492
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:14,480
you.

493
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,910
Elder!

494
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,830
I won't let you die.

495
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,600
I won't let you die.

496
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:31,800
Elder.

497
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:40,570
Elder.

498
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,720
Tushan Honghong,

499
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,880
this is just the beginning.

500
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:56,010
All those you want to protect

501
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,350
will die one by one.

502
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:02,890
Why?

503
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:08,130
Was there no other way?

504
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,290
Why?

505
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,710
Was there no other way?

506
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:52,150
Why?

507
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:54,050
Was there no other way?

508
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,350
Why?

509
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,070
Was there no other way?

510
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:10,950
Everyone, rest assured.

511
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:14,550
The Yiqi Alliance will send people to protect you soon.

512
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,300
The Ximen family will be fine.

513
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,240
Director,

514
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,290
my master was killed by an evil spirit.

515
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,450
Should we ask the Spirit Alliance

516
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,580
for an explanation?

517
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:25,960
Yes.

518
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,040
And our fellow disciples who died at Nanlin,

519
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,110
and those…

520
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,290
Tushan Buzui

521
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,010
is dead.

522
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:51,640
Well...

523
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,110
So what?

524
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,400
He killed so many of our fellow disciples.

525
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,660
We can't just let it go!

526
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,960
We must demand an explanation from Tushan!

527
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,480
Yes.

528
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,550
We need an explanation.

529
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:02,160
Report!

530
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,350
Bad news!

531
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,720
We're surrounded by tree spirits.

532
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,590
Good.

533
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,480
You're all here.

534
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,920
It's you guys,

535
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,110
the Ximen family

536
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,810
and the Yiqi Alliance…

537
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:25,820
You all played a part

538
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,880
in the old fox's death!

539
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:32,880
Even if you didn't steal the Seven-Treasures Bark,

540
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,310
the three drops of blood you took already settled our feuds.

541
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:36,980
That day,

542
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,140
why did you go to Nanlin to pick fights again?

543
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,440
Chief Yueti,

544
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:42,400
this matter...

545
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,070
Shut up!

546
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,360
I thought you were a good man.

547
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,640
But it turns out that you're a treacherous guy who can't tell right from wrong

548
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,300
and favors the Yiqi Alliance.

549
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,710
If it weren't for you,

550
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,770
Buzui wouldn't have died.

551
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,530
I, Yueti Chun,

552
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,240
swear to God

553
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:07,960
that we tree spirits

554
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,930
won't let you trifle with us again.

555
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:14,070
If the disciples of the Yiqi Alliance

556
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:17,570
dare to come to Nanlin again,

557
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,590
I'll kill

558
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,240
every single one of them!

559
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,590
Chief Yueti.

560
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,760
This is not what the old fox would want to see.

561
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,960
Everyone, I know your pain and hatred

562
00:33:58,290 --> 00:33:59,580
better than anyone.

563
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,500
But in the end, this tragedy happened

564
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,810
because the evil spirit, Shi Ji, colluded with Black Foxes

565
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,480
to sow discord among us.

566
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,280
If the Ximen family and Nanlin

567
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,440
turn against each other because of this,

568
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,440
they'll get exactly what they want.

569
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,670
Guys, trust me.

570
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,199
I'll find out the truth

571
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,760
and seek justice

572
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,530
for the dead.

573
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,310
Honghong, with me around,

574
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,880
you just need to try to be a good chief.

575
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,090
Now that Shi Ji's soul has been shattered,

576
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:55,670
she won't come back again.

577
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:58,390
Tushan will only get better and better.

578
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:09,960
Chief.

579
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,390
Everything is ready.

580
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:14,280
It's time…

581
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,520
to send Buzui back to Tushan.

582
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,920
When I was with him,

583
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,360
all he cared about was Tushan.

584
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,420
The place where he'd want to rest in peace

585
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,440
must be Tushan too.

586
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:34,140
Let's go.

587
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:45,850
♫Staring into the moonlit sky♫

588
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:49,980
♫Memories whisper softly in my ears♫

589
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:53,460
♫Borrowing a shimmer of light♫

590
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,840
♫To illuminate you♫

591
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:01,240
♫A thousand years feel like a fleeting moment♫

592
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:05,080
♫This isn't our first time around♫

593
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:08,720
♫Despite all the hardships♫

594
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:11,960
♫The warmth of love still remains♫

595
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:16,100
♫If you forget everything in your next life♫

596
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,200
♫Miss someone but no one is coming♫

597
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,240
♫If you look back♫

598
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:27,600
♫I'm afraid I have to see you leave once more♫

599
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,520
♫If I make a vow in the swirling snow♫

600
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:35,950
♫To bury my entire life♫

601
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:44,210
♫Looking back, how can I make it worth it?♫

602
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:01,350
♫If you forget everything in your next life♫

603
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:05,350
♫Miss someone but no one is coming♫

604
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:03,910
You swore never to set foot in Tushan.

605
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,680
It's his last ride home.

606
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,150
♫If you look back♫

607
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:12,870
♫I'm afraid I have to see you leave once more♫

608
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:08,710
Bid him farewell here.

609
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,430
♫If I make a vow in the swirling snow♫

610
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:20,720
♫To bury my entire life♫

611
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:28,240
♫When I look back, you're under the tree of longing♫

612
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:25,060
Sorry.
