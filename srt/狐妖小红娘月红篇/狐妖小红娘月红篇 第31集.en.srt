[Episode 31]

4
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,270
This way.

5
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,450
Search carefully.

6
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,210
All disciples who took part in stealing the Seven-Treasures Bark

7
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,210
must be executed.

8
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,050
Kill them all.

9
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,030
-Yes.
-Yes.

10
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,370
He's in the backyard!

11
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:46,970
After him!

12
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,250
That's not right.

13
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,760
He was just nearby.

14
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,400
Why did he disappear in the blink of an eye?

15
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,400
His power is weak.

16
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,170
He can't get far.

17
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,170
He must be nearby.

18
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,640
This way.

19
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,680
I finally escaped through a dog hole.

20
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,480
It's so scary.

21
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,339
Good thing I still have my pastry.

22
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:24,270
It's fine if you won't let me see the tree spirits.

23
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,050
But why won't you let Honghong go?

24
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,010
It's for your own good.

25
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,160
For my own good?

26
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,000
Yes.

27
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,270
Haven't you

28
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,950
always wanted to pursue Chief?

29
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,659
I wanted to give you two the opportunity

30
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:38,140
to be alone together...

31
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,460
Since that was your plan,

32
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,110
why are you following us now?

33
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,000
Well...

34
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,540
Well...

35
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,650
Well...

36
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,750
What?

37
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,190
Don't think I don't know.

38
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,150
The chief of Nanlin, Yueti Chun,

39
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,630
and you are...

40
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,120
Stop talking.

41
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,630
How do you know about this?

42
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,630
Who told you that?

43
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:57,280
Well...

44
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,560
I didn't say anything.

45
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,160
You...

46
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,680
All right.

47
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,240
I'll stop teasing you.

48
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,990
Honghong and I will visit the Ximen family.

49
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,050
You can meet your old lover yourself.

50
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,360
Now that you're the Director,

51
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,750
you've become wiser.

52
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,390
I'll leave you two alone.

53
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,270
See you.

54
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,510
Yuechu? Director?

55
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,120
Could he be the director mentioned by the seniors,

56
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,840
Dongfang Yuechu?

57
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,560
Get lost!

58
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,070
Who's your old friend?

59
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,270
Get lost as far as you can.

60
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,260
Chun.

61
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,680
Chun, open the door.

62
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,100
Is there no one left in the Spirit Alliance?

63
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,280
Why would they send you of all spirits?

64
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,900
It was all my fault back then.

65
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,040
Back then...

66
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:03,650
Back then,

67
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,340
who said I had a bad temper

68
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,800
and was stubborn?

69
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,340
Chun,

70
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,160
please be the bigger person

71
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,300
and forgive me.

72
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,310
I will definitely get the

73
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,040
Seven-Treasures Bark for you.

74
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,730
Chun!

75
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,560
Chun.

76
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,110
Chun.

77
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,960
You old fool.

78
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,670
What's wrong with you?

79
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,550
How will you get it back? Tell me.

80
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,000
Chun.

81
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,950
The directors of the Spirit Alliance and Yiqi Alliance

82
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,390
have gone to the Ximen family.

83
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:36,250
They'll definitely get the magic tool back for you.

84
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,730
Then why should I open the door for you?

85
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,140
Chun, can't you let me finish?

86
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,090
The director asked us to meet at the Ximen house.

87
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,210
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

88
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,830
You came at the wrong time.

89
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,150
The patriarch is still cultivating in seclusion.

90
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,270
He can't see any guests.

91
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,270
Please excuse us.

92
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,590
We are here

93
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,909
for the theft of the Seven-Treasures Bark.

94
00:06:56,909 --> 00:06:58,620
There's no need to trouble the patriarch.

95
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,740
We just need a manager to handle this.

96
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,600
While the patriarch is in seclusion,

97
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,190
who is in charge of the matters of the Ximen family?

98
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,040
Me.

99
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:11,630
Eldest Senior.

100
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,600
It's you.

101
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,480
You just won by luck that day.

102
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,040
By luck, you say?

103
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,600
You are not even qualified to be my training partner.

104
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,870
You think I won by luck?

105
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,120
All visitors from afar are guests.

106
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,390
Have you forgotten how to treat guests?

107
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,290
Master, have you completed your seclusion?

108
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,470
Leave us.

109
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:40,170
Yes.

110
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,070
Patriarch Ximen,

111
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,270
where is the tree spirits'

112
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,670
Seven-Treasures Bark?

113
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,750
What does the tree spirits losing their magic tool

114
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,500
have anything to do with the Ximen family?

115
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,270
But the Tree Spirit Clan claims that

116
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,390
Ximen disciples stole the magic tool.

117
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,310
So,

118
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,190
Director Dongfang,

119
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,780
you also think the magic tool is here?

120
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,680
If you need help

121
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,960
with looking for the magic tool,

122
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,810
you simply need to ask

123
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,440
to receive the Ximen family's support.

124
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,160
But if you believe the spirit clan's words

125
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,480
and slander the Ximen family,

126
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,190
forcing us to betray Yiqi Alliance,

127
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,560
I will have

128
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,270
to be rude.

129
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,130
Patriarch Ximen,

130
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,830
are you threatening to

131
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,289
betray the Yiqi Alliance?

132
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:33,850
So what if I am?

133
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,700
You have no evidence.

134
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,080
Are the two of you planning

135
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,909
to frame me for no reason?

136
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,200
This is a leaf from Nanlin.

137
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,720
The sword mark on it

138
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,200
was caused by a move from the Ximen family.

139
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:55,440
Even if someone from the Ximen family had been to Nanlin,

140
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:59,150
it can't prove that the Seven-Treasures Bark

141
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,780
was stolen by one of them.

142
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,640
But members of the Ximen family trespassed Nanlin territory.

143
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,240
How should we deal with that?

144
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,010
I wonder if you could agree

145
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,550
to let the tree spirits conduct an investigation?

146
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,150
This way,

147
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,960
we can prove the innocence of the Ximen family

148
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,400
and forgo the offense of trespassing on Nanlin.

149
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,830
It'll be good for both alliances.

150
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,080
You want to search the Ximen family?

151
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,480
No, no.

152
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,960
The Seven-Treasures Bark is the treasure of the Tree Spirit Clan.

153
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,380
Its scent will remain on

154
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,320
anyone who touches it.

155
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,670
If the chief of the Tree Spirit Clan

156
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,080
can come and investigate,

157
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,610
the truth will be revealed.

158
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,030
In the end,

159
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,460
you still want to search my house.

160
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,550
Sure.

161
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,390
However,

162
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,750
the Ximen family has always been honest.

163
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,580
If we find out

164
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:55,110
the tree spirits framed the Ximen family,

165
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,250
what will you do to

166
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,650
uphold justice for the Ximen family?

167
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,790
What do you want?

168
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,580
If you can't find the magic tool here,

169
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,440
I want three drops of blood from the other party

170
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,200
as an apology.

171
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,480
It's just three drops of blood.

172
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,360
I'm not afraid.

173
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,610
As long as someone from Ximen

174
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,440
has touched the Seven-Treasures Bark,

175
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,550
they can't hide it from me.

176
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,860
Even so,

177
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,870
Ximen Li

178
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,650
made such a strange request.

179
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,440
He's obviously trying to scare us off

180
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,480
so I won't dare to look for treasure.

181
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,170
He underestimated me.

182
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,160
Chun.

183
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:31,670
You...

184
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,790
Director Dongfang has been in there for so long.

185
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,250
Why hasn't he come out yet?

186
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,060
Judging from this fool's situation,

187
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,480
he hasn't realized that

188
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,610
the Seven-Treasures Bark is with him.

189
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,190
The first to make a move

190
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,040
will have the advantage.

191
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,840
I have to find a way

192
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,840
to get the magic tool back.

193
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,680
Save me, sir!

194
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,160
Sir!

195
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,790
Sir.

196
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,360
Help me!

197
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,360
Female...

198
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:41,960
Female...

199
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,180
Female robber!

200
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,260
Help! Help!

201
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,840
Help!

202
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,190
Sir, what are you looking at?

203
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,620
Why are you here again?

204
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,560
Sir.

205
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,910
Help me!

206
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,750
My twin sister wants to kill me!

207
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:12,790
Your twin sister?

208
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,690
She looks exactly like me,

209
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,730
but she's very vicious and cruel.

210
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,160
She's always yelling about killing someone.

211
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,820
The evil woman?

212
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,390
That's her.

213
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,080
No, no, no.

214
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,090
Your sister is too strong.

215
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,150
If I save you,

216
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,150
and your sister goes against me,

217
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,350
I'll be dead for sure.

218
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,020
I can't save you. I'm leaving.

219
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,880
Don't go!

220
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,320
You...

221
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,120
I really can't save you.

222
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,790
Let go of me!

223
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,750
Help me!

224
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,150
Let go!

225
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,350
Mr. Hu!

226
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:58,410
Let go!

227
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,200
Let go of me first.

228
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,030
I can save you.

229
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,820
But I have to make things clear.

230
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,790
My power is weak.

231
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,680
If your sister really comes after me,

232
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,810
I can't protect you.

233
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,550
We have to run our separate ways by then.

234
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,000
It seems

235
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,470
Chief Yueti would rather lose three drops of blood

236
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,090
than to not investigate the Ximen family.

237
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,080
Ximen Li.

238
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,040
Stop playing tricks.

239
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,570
When I find the Seven-Treasures Bark,

240
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,730
I'll see what you have to say.

241
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:47,880
Fine.

242
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:51,250
Then look into it carefully.

243
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,080
How is that possible?

244
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,440
You've checked it.

245
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:42,750
The Seven-Treasures Bark is not with the Ximen family.

246
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,720
Chief Yueti,

247
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,020
all that's left

248
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:49,560
is for you to pay for slandering my family.

249
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,670
Elder Yueti,

250
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,810
the two directors are here as witnesses.

251
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,480
You won't

252
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,520
deny it, right?

253
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,080
I...

254
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,160
Of course not.

255
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,470
Three drops of blood, right?

256
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:08,090
Take it.

257
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,200
This...

258
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,250
This snake is my favorite.

259
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:39,630
Let it take three drops of blood for me.

260
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,600
Patriarch Ximen, you didn't mention

261
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,750
using a snake to draw the blood.

262
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,410
But no one said anything about not using a snake.

263
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,040
Director Dongfang,

264
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,240
previously,

265
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:55,110
you indulged the spirit clan and slandered the Ximen family.

266
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:58,230
You have already disappointed the disciples.

267
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,440
Now,

268
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,960
you're siding with the spirits.

269
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,960
You really don't respect

270
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,240
the Ximen family, do you?

271
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,670
Does the director of the Spirit Alliance

272
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,930
really want to fight with the members of the Yiqi Alliance?

273
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,600
We're not sore losers.

274
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,440
But first,

275
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,270
I need to check the snake.

276
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:22,910
Go ahead.

277
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:47,960
Ximen Li.

278
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,290
I made a mistake.

279
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,590
Don't involve the directors in this.

280
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,630
If you want blood,

281
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,560
come get it.

282
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,200
Wait.

283
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,440
Ximen Li.

284
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,920
You only said you wanted three drops of blood,

285
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,920
but you didn't say whose blood it was.

286
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,050
I have a lot of blood.

287
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,220
Take mine.

288
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,410
You old fool, stop fooling around.

289
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,790
I've long heard that

290
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,450
the Tushan Elder and Chief Yueti

291
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,790
were lovers

292
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,690
when they were young.

293
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,810
For this love,

294
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,280
the Tushan Elder never got married.

295
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,410
But Chief Yueti

296
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,060
married someone else immediately.

297
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,030
It seems that the rumor is true.

298
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,080
Tushan Elder, you sure love

299
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,730
Chief Yueti deeply.

300
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,350
Fine.

301
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,120
I'll grant your wish.

302
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,440
Cut the crap.

303
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,030
It's just three drops of blood.

304
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,350
I can afford it.

305
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:49,750
You...

306
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,690
The Ximen family has many disciples.

307
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,550
Why are there so few people today?

308
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,140
Especially that Ximen Li.

309
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,200
He's acting weird.

310
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,200
In my opinion,

311
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,380
why don't we let Elder and Chief Yueti

312
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,510
search for the Seven-Treasures Bark first?

313
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,570
We'll guard nearby

314
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,440
and see what Ximen Li

315
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,250
is planning.

316
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,210
Hu Weisheng.

317
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,670
I feel disgusted at the thought

318
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,380
of making him fall for me.

319
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,200
If he dies in an accident,

320
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,650
it won't count as robbing, right?

321
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,290
Accidents won't work either?

322
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,170
Once the Seven-Treasures Bark

323
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,060
touches human skin,

324
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,550
it will cling to the host and make him its owner.

325
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,650
Then, it'll automatically

326
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,520
repel any external force applied to its owner.

327
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,320
Don't you know that already?

328
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:00,060
I guess this is the only way.

329
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,530
You...

330
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:26,910
I know.

331
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:27,710
It's...

332
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,880
It's improper for men and women to touch each other.

333
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,160
I didn't mean it.

334
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,190
I didn't mean that.

335
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,200
I know you are...

336
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:44,670
Help...

337
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,590
Help...

338
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,580
Helping me.

339
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,280
Why are you sweating so much?

340
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,680
It's a little hot.

341
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,980
I didn't expect this fool to be shy.

342
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,310
I wonder where on him

343
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,370
the Seven-Treasures Bark is hiding.

344
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,520
Are you okay?

345
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,160
You feel so hot.

346
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,060
I'm fine.

347
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,030
It's not at the front.

348
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,450
Could it be on his back?

349
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:53,800
I'm really fine.

350
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,240
Since I was young,

351
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,650
no one has ever cared this much for me.

352
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,670
And no one has taken care of me so meticulously.

353
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,110
No.

354
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,720
No.

355
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,160
Hu Weisheng.

356
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,190
You can’t be moved so easily.

357
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,370
Her sister is so powerful.

358
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,490
When she recovers,

359
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,880
I have to stay away from her.

360
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,270
Sir!

361
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,110
Sir!

362
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,160
Sir!

363
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:50,770
Sir...

364
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:03,980
What's wrong?

365
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,610
When you recover...

366
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:09,660
They're nearby.

367
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:10,720
Check over there.

368
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,000
Yes, sir.

369
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,720
Come here.

370
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,550
You leave first.

371
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,670
I'll distract them.

372
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:14,220
It's dangerous there!

373
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:14,660
You...

374
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,000
For me,

375
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,950
she's even risking her life.

376
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:36,480
Chun.

377
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,960
Chief and Yuechu are working on it.

378
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:43,250
They will find the magic tool no matter what.

379
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,780
Do you also think I made a mistake?

380
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,310
Of course not.

381
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,290
You're always right.

382
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,590
But that Ximen Li

383
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,810
must have done something.

384
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:07,790
Chun.

385
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,920
I heard you have a daughter.

386
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,340
Why haven't I seen her?

387
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,070
Don't mention it.

388
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,550
She's always messing around.

389
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,480
I don't know

390
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,270
where she's off to again lately.

391
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,730
She's always worrying me.

392
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,130
Chun.

393
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,960
I don't mean to nag,

394
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,070
but you should control your temper

395
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,070
and care more about your daughter.

396
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,110
None of your business.

397
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,270
Don't be angry.

398
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,550
After all,

399
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,720
you are her only family left.

400
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,270
Shut up.

401
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,790
You have no child.

402
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:38,410
Why are you teaching me how to discipline my child?

403
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,940
It's none of your business.

404
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:42,410
Does it hurt?

405
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:44,530
No.

406
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:47,480
No.

407
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:51,540
Damn it.

408
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:52,960
That old man Ximen Li

409
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,080
sent someone after me.

410
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,310
I tried so hard to escape.

411
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,620
Fortunately, they haven't found that

412
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:01,110
the Seven-Treasures Bark is with that fool.

413
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,320
Are you okay?

414
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:08,180
I...

415
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:09,510
I searched for you in the forest

416
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,790
but I couldn't find you.

417
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,920
How did you escape when they were so powerful?

418
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,720
Are you hurt?

419
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,710
No.

420
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:16,170
I...

421
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,800
I...

422
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,190
Here's the thing.

423
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:24,050
After they found me, they realized they got the wrong person.

424
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,160
So they let me go.

425
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,620
I was lost, so it took me a while

426
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,760
to find this place.

427
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,060
You...

428
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,540
What's wrong?

429
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:44,000
Did he see through my lies?

430
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,630
I just think that

431
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,270
since I was young,

432
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,720
no one has ever cared about me

433
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,540
and taken care of me like you did.

434
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,910
You're even keeping me company.

435
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:11,830
Then...

436
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,760
what about your parents?

437
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,030
When I was young,

438
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,380
they went into the mountains to cut firewood

439
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,510
and ran into wolves.

440
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,120
So I was raised by my neighbors.

441
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,070
Then the Ximen family was recruiting disciples.

442
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,960
I registered and was selected.

443
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,690
That's how I got a place to stay.

444
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,610
I didn't expect

445
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,120
this fool to be quite pitiful.

446
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,950
At worst, I can spare his life

447
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,200
after I get the magic tool back.

448
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,710
Forget it.

449
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,170
Let's not talk about that.

450
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,730
I have some delicious food.

451
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,140
Here you go.

452
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,230
I don't like this.

453
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,510
I've always been alone.

454
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:12,990
So I'm not really

455
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:15,750
good at taking care of others.

456
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,590
But,

457
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,680
if you like or want

458
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,680
anything in the future,

459
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,610
you must tell me.

460
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,050
I'll try to satisfy you.

461
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,720
Really?

462
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,110
How are you going to satisfy me

463
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,170
and take care of me?

464
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,850
To be honest,

465
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:36,030
I'm being hunted because I

466
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,010
offended the Ximen family.

467
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,170
But don't worry.

468
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,510
The new Director, Dongfang, is here.

469
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:43,840
He treats the people and the ordinary disciples very well.

470
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,030
As long as we find him,

471
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,110
he can protect us.

472
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:47,300
No.

473
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,920
You can't go to the director.

474
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,350
Why not?

475
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,550
If this fool is protected by the director,

476
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,280
how can I get the treasure back?

477
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:56,590
You...

478
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,060
You want to take care of me

479
00:28:58,550 --> 00:28:59,830
by finding the director?

480
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:00,590
What else?

481
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,020
My power is weak.

482
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,400
If they come after me again,

483
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,860
I can't protect you at all.

484
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,750
I thought...

485
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:16,050
I thought you were going to

486
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:18,370
ask my mother for my hand in marriage.

487
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,410
Your hand...

488
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:21,920
In marriage?

489
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,350
Before this,

490
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,550
in order to save you,

491
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,080
haven't we

492
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,600
already had physical contact?

493
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,740
Shouldn't you

494
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,100
take care of me for the rest of my life?

495
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,400
I... I...

496
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,310
You want to deny it?

497
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,300
No, no, no.

498
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,610
Do you hate me?

499
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,470
No, no, no.

500
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,780
Not at all.

501
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,270
Then go ask my mother for my hand in marriage.

502
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,160
Don't worry.

503
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,580
My mother will like you.

504
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:00,890
And my elders are quite capable.

505
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,830
They can protect us.

506
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:08,410
Are you going or not?

507
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:08,900
Well...

508
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,010
I...

509
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,720
I'll go.

510
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,880
Let me ask you a question.

511
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:32,670
Do you...

512
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,050
Do you like me?

513
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,590
I...

514
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,480
will do my best to like you.

515
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:48,280
Leave now.

516
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,690
Ximen Li has left the house.

517
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,720
Everything is ready.

518
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,440
Tushan Honghong.

519
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,880
Do you think

520
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,000
I didn't notice your tricks?

521
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,360
You thought of

522
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,790
casting a fox spell on my black snake.

523
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,960
I might as well use it

524
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,780
and lure you into the Mist Formation.

525
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,790
Sui Fu.

526
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,960
Tushan Honghong.

527
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,400
Her Highness ordered me

528
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,699
to show you the true power of the Black Fox.

529
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:36,300
Love and hatred

530
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,230
are separated by a thin line.

531
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,600
The Mist Formation is complete.

532
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:42,409
No one can escape!

533
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,600
Honghong.

534
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:46,960
Honghong!

535
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:01,070
Why did you hide it from me?

536
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,130
You've always wanted my life,

537
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:08,770
right?

538
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,760
What are you talking about?

539
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,840
Just now,

540
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,980
we both entered the illusion.

541
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,930
I struggled to wake up.

542
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,310
What did you see?

543
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:25,010
Something is wrong with Ximen Li.

544
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,440
Just now...

545
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,210
Were you afraid?

546
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:52,880
Even in that situation,

547
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,650
you still remember me,

548
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:56,710
right?

549
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,840
I've promised you that.

550
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:03,830
It won't change.

551
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,860
Go to sleep. I'll keep watch.

552
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,960
Father, save me!

553
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:54,150
Father, help me!

554
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:57,510
Mother wants to kill me.

555
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,760
Mother?

556
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,200
The Dongfang family

557
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,850
must sacrifice something.

558
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:11,730
Father, save me!

559
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:19,440
The contract is in the bloodline of the Dongfang family.

560
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,100
You can't break the contract.

561
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:24,260
Honghong, are you crazy?

562
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:44,770
He used the Dongfang Spiritual Blood

563
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:46,570
to awaken their consciousness.

564
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,060
It doesn't matter.

565
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,810
The seeds of suspicion have been planted.

566
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,300
They will bloom soon.

567
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,480
The result...

568
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,760
No.

569
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,670
Impossible.

570
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,760
It was just an illusion.
