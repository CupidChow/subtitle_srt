4
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,280
When the Grief Tree was corroded by the Dark Force,

5
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,979
I didn't know that.

6
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:56,410
I didn't know the brat was from the Dongfang family either.

7
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,460
When he pretended to run away

8
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,150
and helped Sister deal with Jin Renfeng,

9
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,280
I also knew nothing.

10
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,680
It's fine that I knew nothing.

11
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,539
But the White Fox I saved

12
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,280
turned out to be Shi Ji's spy.

13
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,370
I'm such a failure as the Deputy Chief.

14
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,040
Yaya,

15
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,020
what you just said

16
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,360
are not your fault.

17
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,520
Honghong has her own arrangements and considerations

18
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,430
for hiding things from you.

19
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,770
What about Guoguo?

20
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,630
I brought Guoguo to Tushan myself.

21
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,150
Now that I think about it,

22
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,520
he might have already

23
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,579
been colluding with Shi Ji

24
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:38,110
against Tushan since the matchmaking event.

25
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,130
He even killed Princess Bu Tai.

26
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,040
Yaya, let me ask you.

27
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,850
Is it your fault for being kind?

28
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,280
Even if you didn't save him,

29
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,130
Shi Ji would have used different ways

30
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,280
to plant her spies in Tushan.

31
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,030
Even so,

32
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,150
I'm still at fault.

33
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,430
I'll make amends for your faults

34
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,230
with you.

35
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,020
Chief.

36
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,590
Huang Yao, the chief of Huangfeng Ridge, is here to visit you.

37
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,120
What for?

38
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,370
I heard that recently,

39
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,360
the disciples of their clan have been going missing.

40
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,160
He's here to ask for help from the Spirit Alliance.

41
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,250
Bring him in.

42
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:34,840
Yes.

43
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,840
Greetings, Chief of Tushan.

44
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,610
Forgo the formalities, Mr. Huang.

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,590
About the disappearing spirits of Huangfeng Ridge,

46
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,120
please tell us the details.

47
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,430
A few days ago,

48
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,750
people started going missing on the ridge.

49
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,410
To this day,

50
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,730
five disciples have gone missing.

51
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,070
The last one

52
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,410
is the top fighter of our clan.

53
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,200
Even the top fighter is missing?

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,800
That's right.

55
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,210
During this period,

56
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,430
I can hardly eat or rest.

57
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,680
Please help me

58
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,750
find my missing disciples.

59
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,400
Do these missing disciples

60
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,260
have a common enemy?

61
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,779
I have always taught my disciples to be benevolent.

62
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,230
The disciples of the ridge have been good too.

63
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,160
They take care of the villagers

64
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,560
and never make any enemies.

65
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,360
Do they have anything in common?

66
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,510
In common?

67
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:37,930
I remember now.

68
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,330
These disciples

69
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,420
formed their spirit cores before they were 100 years old.

70
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,750
Their spirit cores are pure and powerful.

71
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,790
Ordinary cultivators or spirits

72
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,510
can never hurt them.

73
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,040
Sir,

74
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,200
do you have any of the missing people's belongings with you?

75
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,720
This magic tool belongs to the last missing disciple,

76
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,720
the Jingfeng Fan.

77
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,360
I found it outside his room on the day he went missing.

78
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,040
Please help me

79
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,240
find my missing disciples.

80
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:18,740
After this,

81
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:22,520
I'll lead the thousands of spirits of Huangfeng Ridge

82
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,870
to join the Spirit Alliance.

83
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,160
You're too kind, sir.

84
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,120
This concerns the lives of spirits.

85
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,680
Whether Huangfeng Ridge joins the Spirit Alliance or not,

86
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,070
I, Tushan Honghong, will do my best.

87
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,430
Thank you, Chief.

88
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,010
Elder, see Mr. Huang off for me.

89
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:39,800
Yes.

90
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,240
Please.

91
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,190
Is he dead?

92
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:03,970
Lady Fairy.

93
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,700
You did well this time.

94
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,430
You didn't take the risk alone.

95
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,700
Since I promised you,

96
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,460
I won't let you worry.

97
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,560
Where's Guoguo?

98
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,830
I've been following him.

99
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,060
He entered the fog.

100
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,950
Something is wrong with this fog.

101
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,270
It erased his aura.

102
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,310
Let's go.

103
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,680
This way.

104
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:23,600
This must be the Huangfeng Ridge disciple who went missing.

105
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,450
Someone stole his spirit core.

106
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,180
Shi Ji is secretly hunting spirit cores?

107
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,450
Jin Renfeng has lost his value.

108
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:41,430
She's not in a hurry to find another useful target.

109
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,040
Instead, she's using spirit cores to improve herself.

110
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,630
She's not relying on others.

111
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,890
Those missing spirits

112
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,630
are experts who have been cultivating for 100 years

113
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,030
and cultivated the Chunyuan spirit cores.

114
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,050
Consuming their spirit cores

115
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,630
can rapidly increase her spirit power

116
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,030
and strengthen her body.

117
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,360
Guoguo is doing the hunting for Shi Ji.

118
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,630
What should we do?

119
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,200
We can't let them harm the spirits freely.

120
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,830
I've tested Guoguo's strength before.

121
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,120
Ordinary spirits are no match for him.

122
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,400
Inform the Spirit Alliance

123
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,570
to secretly send people to protect those weak spirits.

124
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,000
Also, inform those

125
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,390
who have cultivated the Chunyuan spirit core

126
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,720
to stay home if they can.

127
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,310
Most importantly, do not act alone.

128
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,140
You wish to marry under the Grief Tree?

129
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,360
I hope Tushan can grant our wish.

130
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:41,190
The Grief Tree has been matchmaking for Tushan for a long while.

131
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,440
But few spirits have wanted to marry under the Grief Tree.

132
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,720
Your idea is very novel.

133
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,360
Third-ranking Chief, donâ€™t you think

134
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,140
there's a first time for everything?

135
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,510
It is the Grief Tree's wish

136
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,420
to help spirits get attached.

137
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:58,180
This is a gift from Chengyuan and me.

138
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,560
It's a small gesture,

139
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,800
so please accept it.

140
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:02,540
Well...

141
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,950
We need the Chief to make the decision.

142
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,360
Although Kuzhu Peak is not far from Tushan,

143
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,060
it's still troublesome to go back and forth.

144
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,830
Why don't you two stay here

145
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,970
and tour around?

146
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,290
I'll hold a banquet for you tonight

147
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,350
and give you an answer, alright?

148
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,320
-Alright.
-Alright.

149
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,960
-Thank you, Third-ranking Chief.
-Thank you, Third-ranking Chief.

150
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,090
Please come with me.

151
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:39,880
Rongrong...

152
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,150
Rongrong!

153
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:41,960
How was it?

154
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,990
Did Lai and I do well just now?

155
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:45,430
It was perfect.

156
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,510
As long as you treat White Fox like today,

157
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,370
you'll be fine.

158
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,650
Chengyuan,

159
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,770
I'm willing to tie the knot with you under the Grief Tree

160
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:55,590
and let this love last forever

161
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,700
and be protected by the Grief Tree.

162
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,310
Be careful.

163
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,510
Don't let that fox see through you.

164
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,750
Don't worry.

165
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,840
Rongrong's disguise magic

166
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,370
can change our appearances

167
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,750
and our spirit auras.

168
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,400
No one can see through it.

169
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,920
But you still have to be careful.

170
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,720
I've seen how cunning and meticulous

171
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,020
that white fox is.

172
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,790
Okay, I'll listen to you, honey.

173
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,100
Who is your honey?

174
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,240
You, of course.

175
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:32,960
Not bad.

176
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,190
Sesame pills.

177
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,090
Jin's sesame pills.

178
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,680
What is this?

179
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,720
Have a taste.

180
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,080
Have a taste.

181
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:47,740
One box, please.

182
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:49,360
Okay.

183
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:50,750
Please come again.

184
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,480
Take it.

185
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,150
Excuse me.

186
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,670
You don't seem local.

187
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,270
They say that the scenery at Tushan's Sanli Hill is stunning.

188
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,490
The view of the rainbow there is famous in the six realms.

189
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,670
A thunderstorm is coming today.

190
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,600
It's a good time to see the rainbow.

191
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,070
Thank you for telling us.

192
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,480
You're welcome.

193
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:21,670
Iâ€™m going to Sanli Hill too.

194
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,230
If you are willing,

195
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,630
you can go with me.

196
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:28,940
Thank you for your kindness.

197
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,270
We dare not disturb you.

198
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,030
We can go there ourselves.

199
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,810
In that case,

200
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,860
I wish you a safe journey.

201
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:39,510
Goodbye.

202
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,080
Let's go.

203
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,140
Look.

204
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:04,870
Mister?

205
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,770
Mister, Miss.

206
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,630
I didn't expect to meet you here.

207
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,510
It must be fate.

208
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:12,870
Thank you

209
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,770
for introducing this place to us.

210
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,770
You're welcome.

211
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,910
Since it's fated to be,

212
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,320
I can show you

213
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,960
around here.

214
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,580
Apart from the rainbow,

215
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,580
the view here is also great.

216
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,270
Well...

217
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,700
Unfortunately,

218
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:30,480
we have an appointment with the Third-ranking Chief tonight.

219
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,480
Iâ€™m afraid weâ€™ll let you down again.

220
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:36,580
I didnâ€™t expect you to know the Third-ranking Chief.

221
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:37,770
To be honest,

222
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,310
we're here to ask

223
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,420
the Grief Tree of Tushan

224
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,430
to witness our marriage.

225
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,880
In that case, I shall leave you alone.

226
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,120
We have time.

227
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,250
As long as you're still in Tushan,

228
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,360
we will meet again.

229
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,650
Goodbye.

230
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,440
I can't believe

231
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,900
he is really hunting spirit cores for Shi Ji.

232
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,190
I brought him to Tushan.

233
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,530
I must catch him myself.

234
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,640
Prepare a wedding dress?

235
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,900
Who are you marrying?

236
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,790
Old fox, are you getting old?

237
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,360
With me here,

238
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,540
who can she marry?

239
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,470
You...

240
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,790
I object!

241
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,390
No, no, no!

242
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,870
Chief,

243
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,820
we have so many powerful spirits in the clan.

244
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,730
There are plenty better than him.

245
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:41,000
Marrying anyone is better than marrying him.

246
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,790
Don't say that, old fox.

247
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,190
Although I'm a human,

248
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,590
few spirits in Tushan

249
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,120
are stronger than me.

250
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,800
Speaking of which,

251
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,110
Lai is pretty good.

252
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,080
Lai is not bad.

253
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,200
Chief,

254
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,910
you can consider marrying Lai instead.

255
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,510
Elder,

256
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,640
you've been cultivating for 1,000 years.

257
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,250
Why are you always fooled

258
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,340
by this twenty-year-old kid/human?

259
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,280
That's right.

260
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,510
If Lai marries Lady Fairy,

261
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,910
who will Yaya marry?

262
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,010
Fool.

263
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,240
Deputy Chief?

264
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,260
Deputy Chief is getting married too?

265
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,490
I'm even more confused now.

266
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,260
Who is the wedding for?

267
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,730
Chief agreed?

268
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,510
Yes.

269
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,020
Chief wants to personally

270
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,460
officiate your wedding in 3 days.

271
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,340
This is the first marriage Tushan will be

272
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:36,560
personally witnessing since its establishment.

273
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,510
The full moon is in three days.

274
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,480
To be able to receive the Grief Tree's protection

275
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,910
and the Chief's blessings,

276
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,970
Chengyuan and I are deeply grateful.

277
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,240
With the protection of the Grief Tree,

278
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,840
both of you will be safe

279
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,650
and have a happy marriage.

280
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,360
As long as I eat

281
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,760
another century-old spirit core tonight,

282
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,910
no one in the world can stop me anymore.

283
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,000
Spirit Lord.

284
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,190
Where is the spirit core?

285
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,270
Why don't I smell the spirit core?

286
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,030
Spirit Lord,

287
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,280
I have someone in mind.

288
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,300
Please give me more time.

289
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,870
I will get the spirit core

290
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,390
and help you regain

291
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,670
all your powers.

292
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,630
How long do you want me to wait?

293
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,240
I

294
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,510
will do anything

295
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,450
for you.

296
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,000
Tonight, I will definitely

297
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,670
acquire the spirit core.

298
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,950
You'd better not keep me waiting.

299
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:29,770
Take care, sir.

300
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,480
All right, let's call it a day.

301
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,010
Thank you for helping us this time.

302
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,480
After we go back,

303
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,960
Chengyuan and I will recommend relatives and friends

304
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,220
to come to Tushan to pray for attachment.

305
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,290
You're welcome.

306
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,270
-Elder, Third-ranking Chief.
-Elder, Third-ranking Chief.

307
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,330
-See you.
-See you.

308
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,440
Okay.

309
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,370
Have a safe trip.

310
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:38,230
You can only blame yourself for working too hard.

311
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:41,440
You cultivated the Chunyuan spirit core at such a young age.

312
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,440
But it's alright.

313
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,820
You will meet each other again soon.

314
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,080
This spirit core

315
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,270
came just in time.

316
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,160
Get lost.

317
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:06,220
Yes.

318
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,260
No, this cultivation...

319
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,010
Oh no, my power...

320
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:08,640
Puppet Art?

321
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,020
That female spirit was a fake!

322
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:12,710
Guoguo.

323
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:15,680
Yaya?

324
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:17,660
Why are you here?

325
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,620
At the matchmaking event,

326
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,110
did you collaborate with Jin Renfeng

327
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,230
to trap Sister in a nightmare

328
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,360
and almost kill her?

329
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,050
In the streets of Beishan,

330
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,220
did you assassinate Princess Bu Tai?

331
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,350
The spirits who went missing in Huangfeng Ridge.

332
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:31,880
Yaya...

333
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,310
Did you capture them?

334
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,690
I hate the human race.

335
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,110
If it weren't for the human race and their Mother Talisman,

336
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,480
my face wouldn't have been disfigured.

337
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,540
Neither would I...

338
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,810
have been bullied.

339
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,590
Guoguo.

340
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,610
If you are willing,

341
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,200
go back to Tushan with me and confess your crimes.

342
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:52,930
Impossible!

343
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,700
Are you determined to betray Tushan

344
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,590
and go against us?

345
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,120
Ya...

346
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:00,770
Yaya.

347
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:01,920
Don't call me that!

348
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,770
Since you are so stubborn,

349
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,070
I can only punish you as a traitor.

350
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,590
Tushan Honghong.

351
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,750
I waited for hundreds of years

352
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,550
to finally reform my physical body.

353
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,530
I've been suffering for hundreds of years

354
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,610
for the spirit clan of Tushan to dominate the six realms

355
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,590
and no longer be bullied by the human race.

356
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,990
We wouldn't have to hide within the bounds of Tushan anymore.

357
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,160
Everything I've done

358
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,030
is for the sake of Tushan.

359
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,920
But you

360
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:35,410
keep ruining my plan.

361
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,920
You killed so many spirits

362
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,350
for your own selfish desire.

363
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,810
Everything you've done

364
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,810
will only bring misery to both humans and spirits.

365
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,790
I stopped you 400 years ago.

366
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,720
Today, I'll stop you again.

367
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,640
Enough talk.

368
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:58,090
You betrayed me 400 years ago.

369
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,350
Today,

370
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,270
I'll take revenge on you.

371
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,530
I'll make sure you die a miserable death.

372
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,080
You don't even repent when you're about to die.

373
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,690
Die?

374
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,440
You'll be the one dying this time!

375
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:50,570
I won't allow anyone to hurt my sister

376
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,750
and betray Tushan.

377
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,610
You ungrateful fox.

378
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,720
You're loyal to this vicious woman.

379
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,240
That's great.

380
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,370
The evil spirit

381
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,920
is finally executed.

382
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,480
What's your name?

383
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,000
I...

384
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,370
I don't have a name.

385
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,990
How about Guoguo?

386
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,250
Guoguo?

387
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,000
With my protection,

388
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,250
you'll live a good life from now on.

389
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,510
Yaya.

390
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,440
I brought you yogurt.

391
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,430
I queued up for a long time

392
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,810
and my tail was trampled by other spirits.

393
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,310
I know you love drinking.

394
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,720
So I asked around

395
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,720
and finally got this grape wine for you.

396
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,960
You sought it for me?

397
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,610
At least you have a conscience.

398
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,940
Why are you hiding here alone?

399
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,280
I'm not sad about the white fox or anything.

400
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,990
I just got sand in my eyes.

401
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:10,200
So what if you're sad about him?

402
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,590
Come to think of it,

403
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,000
Guoguo spent a long time living with us.

404
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,880
He was already a member of Tushan.

405
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,260
Who wouldn't be sad

406
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,940
after what happened to him today?

407
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,140
Really?

408
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:42,640
Yes.

409
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,310
If he hadn't scolded me that day,

410
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:50,510
I would have cried with you today.

411
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,710
That's because you always bullied him.

412
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,350
It's all my fault in the end.

413
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,450
If I hadn't saved him that day,

414
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,970
this wouldn't have happened.

415
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,320
Silly girl.

416
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,000
You didn't do anything wrong.

417
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:17,280
At that time,

418
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,240
he was lucky that you saved him.

419
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,570
You did nothing wrong.

420
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:24,030
After that, he hurt Tushan.

421
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,680
You did nothing wrong killing him either.

422
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,280
There are many things in life

423
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,500
we cannot control,

424
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,420
including humanity.

425
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:35,590
The only thing we can do is to remember our original intentions.

426
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,720
Do good deeds

427
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,340
and punish evil.

428
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,570
You've got some skills.

429
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,960
You often take people to see the sunrise, right?

430
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,830
Of course not.

431
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:18,440
You're the first one.

432
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,880
I like you.

433
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,310
Yaya.

434
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,880
â™«The falling leavesâ™«

435
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,110
What about you?

436
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,640
â™«Land on autumn grassâ™«

437
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:40,890
â™«Who knocked on my heart againâ™«

438
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:39,330
-I...
-I know.

439
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,880
Youâ€™ve always liked

440
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,160
Aolai Sanshao.

441
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,600
â™«I look back a thousand timesâ™«

442
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:48,640
â™«At the most unbearable sincerityâ™«

443
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,760
â™«Waiting for you to askâ™«

444
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,720
In my heart,

445
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:54,800
â™«Let the warmth linger even for a momentâ™«

446
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,070
Sanshao is no match for you.

447
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:58,220
â™«My missing descend from the skyâ™«

448
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,260
Listen carefully.

449
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:01,440
â™«Turning into countless whispersâ™«

450
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,380
The one I like

451
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,510
is you, Lai.

452
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:07,370
â™«I wipe away your tears with a piece of night skyâ™«

453
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,240
â™«The past is always the sameâ™«

454
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,780
â™«I've heard of the jokes in the streetsâ™«

455
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:21,180
â™«How deep can this love carve into the woodâ™«

456
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:24,430
â™«The red leaves set us ablazeâ™«

457
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,700
â™«The snow drains our warmthâ™«

458
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,920
â™«We keep parting and loving each other againâ™«

459
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,920
â™«Living life like a dreamâ™«

460
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:37,680
â™«My heart and mind are always conflictingâ™«

461
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:41,510
â™«I have passed by so many peopleâ™«

462
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,330
â™«All that is leftâ™«

463
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,450
â™«Is my reflection in your eyesâ™«

464
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,370
Chief, please wait.

465
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,510
Thank you

466
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,350
for your help this time.

467
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,200
Although my disciple died tragically,

468
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,920
solving this matter

469
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:19,350
serves as an explanation

470
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:21,350
for the other disciples of our clan.

471
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,880
My condolences, sir.

472
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:26,080
I shall summon

473
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,270
the spirits around us to join the Spirit Alliance

474
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,730
to eliminate evil spirits

475
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,590
and protect the weak together.

476
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,190
Thank you.

477
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,700
If in the six realms,

478
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,840
spirits can help each other,

479
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:39,030
the Spirit Alliance shall be glad.

480
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:39,690
All right.

481
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,300
Enough with the formalities.

482
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,310
Now that we're all part of the Spirit Alliance,

483
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,040
there's no need to be so polite.

484
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,110
My mini pavilion.

485
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,070
I've missed you so much.

486
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,000
I thought I was the only calculative one in Tushan.

487
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:11,640
You have truly impressed me this time.

488
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,640
You got so much money

489
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,200
from Lai at once.

490
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:17,110
I'm making money for Tushan.

491
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,720
I didn't expect him to be dumb and rich.

492
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,000
He suggested being the groom instead.

493
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,160
But right from the start,

494
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,360
Lady Fairy had already picked them for the fake marriage.

495
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,010
Who taught you how to

496
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,900
swindle people's money this way?

497
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,110
My little tricks

498
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,880
are not as good as yours.

499
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:36,750
Yuechu!

500
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:39,360
Yuechu?

501
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,030
My friend is here.

502
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,820
Rongrong, see you.

503
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,800
See you. See you.

504
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,570
Third-ranking Chief.

505
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:54,310
Yuechu,

506
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:59,550
when I found out about your identity,

507
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,270
I did some bad things.

508
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,510
You...

509
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,350
Stop it.

510
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,260
I've forgiven you.

511
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,330
You really don't mind?

512
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:11,540
You're indeed my good brother.

513
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,770
My gift for you won't be wasted either.

514
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,720
Here, a book on chasing the lady you like.

[How To Pursue The Woman You Love]

516
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,070
I don't need it now.

517
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,560
Why not?

518
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:29,920
No way.

519
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:32,570
Have you captured the Chief's heart?

520
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,040
No, that can't be.

521
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:38,850
For hundreds of years,

522
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,210
Chief was never interested in any spirit.

523
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:42,750
You?

524
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,210
Impossible.

525
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:46,790
Whatever.

526
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,440
I heard that all spirit couples

527
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,110
who got the Feathered Flowers

528
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,160
are married now.

529
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,270
Only you and Jiushuang haven't done anything.

530
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:54,720
Yes.

531
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:56,730
So what?

532
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,750
I'm playing hard to get.

533
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,680
What do you know?

534
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,350
Forget it.

535
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:07,250
Let me teach you something.

536
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,210
Come and sit.

537
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,220
First, you must create

538
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:22,020
a dreamy scenario for Jiushuang.

539
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,440
Then, you can show your sincerity.

540
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,480
The most important thing

541
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,700
is the atmosphere.

542
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,410
The atmosphere

543
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:32,290
will bring out the emotions.

544
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,070
That makes sense.

545
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,310
Qixi Festival is in a few days.

546
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,510
I was wondering

547
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:43,490
how to invite Jiushuang to celebrate the festival together.

548
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:44,900
Qixi Festival?

549
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,160
You can drink as much as you want.

550
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,120
You've always been stingy.

551
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:55,960
Why are you

552
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,560
suddenly so generous today?

553
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,380
Do you have a favor to ask?

554
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,940
Go ahead.

555
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,510
You two are really smart.

556
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,650
I can't hide anything from you.

557
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,270
Here's the thing.

558
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,510
Twenty taels?

559
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,350
That's too expensive!

560
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:15,790
No way.

561
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:16,900
Hey now.

562
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,540
Look at this.

563
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,310
These are new lanterns

564
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,640
from the Human Market.

565
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,380
Only my stall has them!

566
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,340
I'm using them to make my stall stand out

567
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,000
so customers will visit my stall.

568
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,130
You don't want them?

569
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,460
Good, I'm not selling!

570
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,610
My old buddy,

571
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,440
we've known each other for so many years.

572
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,210
Can you give me a discount?

573
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,080
I'll give you a discount

574
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:41,080
for your next rent.

575
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:42,170
Discount?

576
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,750
Don't lie to me.

577
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:44,900
You have no say in that.

578
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,030
You? Give me a discount?

579
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,030
Forget it.

580
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:47,440
Quit trying.

581
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:47,830
I'm not

582
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,090
giving you a discount.

583
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,320
Don't delay my business.

584
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:52,880
Mu Tong.

585
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,980
Don't force me to tell on you.

586
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,510
Do it if you dare.

587
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,700
What can you possibly tell on me?

588
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,760
Have you forgotten

589
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,830
about the lottery tickets you sold?

590
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,240
I remember it clearly.

591
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,750
Stop it.

592
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,659
How much will you sell the lanterns for?

593
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:11,870
Name your price.

594
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,300
Stop it.

595
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:15,530
You...

596
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,800
You bought so many lanterns.

597
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,860
I was wondering who was so generous.

598
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,239
In my opinion, these worldly things

599
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,409
can only impress those

600
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,030
greedy and vain spirits.

601
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,030
What do you know?

602
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:28,630
How much?

603
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,080
Be honest.

604
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,280
If Chief is also

605
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,679
a vain and greedy spirit,

606
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:35,219
will you still like her?

607
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,960
Recently, for some unknown reason,

608
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,670
men often say that

609
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:43,650
if a woman truly loves him,

610
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:46,449
she shouldn't mention money.

611
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,920
If she mentions money at all,

612
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,989
she'll be called vain and greedy.

613
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,170
I would like to ask them.

614
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,150
Instead of blaming the woman,

615
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,830
why won't the man work harder

616
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:58,440
and make more money?

617
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:01,280
So these problems you mentioned

618
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,740
are no problem to me at all.

619
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,470
Since I like Lady Fairy,

620
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:07,310
I will try my best to fulfill her wishes.

621
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:10,680
Her wish is my wish.

622
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:13,310
However,

623
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,640
I am discontented with Lady Fairy

624
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,800
over a tiny matter.

625
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,480
Tell me.

626
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:24,800
Her two sisters are too hard to deal with.

627
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,520
They are too troublesome and annoying.

628
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,200
You said it yourself.

629
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:31,810
So what?

630
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,920
I'm a man of my word...

631
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,960
You brat...

632
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,440
Yaya!

633
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,590
I've wanted to beat you up for a while!

634
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:40,630
That's not what I meant.

635
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:40,920
Come here!

636
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,590
Lady Fairy, save me!

637
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,190
Stop!
