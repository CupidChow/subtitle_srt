[Episode 22]

4
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,510
Let me do it.

5
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,570
Poor Fu Cheng.

6
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,350
She suffered a lot under Jin Renfeng's command.

7
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,800
And now she's in such trouble.

8
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,240
Don't worry.

9
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,020
The doctor said

10
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,120
she will wake up.

11
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,670
Even so,

12
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,190
I still feel...

13
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:43,750
Young Master.

14
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,710
Since you're back this time, don't leave.

15
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,670
I'm old too.

16
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,560
And Fu Cheng is in this state.

17
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,750
There will come one day Divine Flame Villa

18
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,520
has to be entrusted to you.

19
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,800
Of course.

20
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,250
Let alone Divine Flame Villa.

21
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,850
The whole Yiqi Alliance

22
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,000
will be entrusted to me in the future.

23
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,080
You mean...

24
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,810
You haven't liked Hongye, have you?

25
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,960
How about I take over him as the director in the future?

26
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,620
How's that?

27
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,320
That does sound good.

28
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,620
But there are many noble families in Yiqi Alliance.

29
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,050
They are all powerful people.

30
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,340
How can you win?

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,520
I'm asking if you'll help me.

32
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,520
Of course.

33
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,860
I will do my best.

34
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,100
I knew you are the best to me.

35
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,900
This time,

36
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,980
Yiqi Alliance has gathered all sects

37
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,310
to discuss what happened in Huntian Prison.

38
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,440
I'll go on your behalf.

39
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,160
How's that?

40
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,680
Sure.

41
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:36,800
However,

42
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,590
I heard that Patriarch Nangong family that

43
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,710
the director of the Spirit Alliance, Tushan Honghong, helped evil spirits escape the prison.

44
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,440
After all, you lived in Tushan.

45
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,750
Shouldn't you avoid suspicion?

46
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:52,640
Don't worry.

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,930
I know what to do.

48
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,670
Hang in there.

49
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,630
You're so clumsy.

50
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,290
Let me do it!

51
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,350
As expected from the leader of Chi Sha Bandits.

52
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,910
You've been in Huntian Prison for hundreds of years

53
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,640
but are still so clear-headed.

54
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,510
Who are you?

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,459
It doesn't matter who I am.

56
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,399
What matters is

57
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,280
I can find you the best place

58
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,740
for you to hid yourselves.

59
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,310
For what happened

60
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,120
at Huntian Prison,

61
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,980
what does everyone

62
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,240
have to say?

63
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,070
Director,

64
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,190
there are many traps

65
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,070
in Huntian Prison.

66
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,980
It has always frightened the spirits.

67
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,310
The escape

68
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,270
of the spirits this time

69
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,700
really taints the reputation of Yiqi Alliance.

70
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:16,270
I think we should investigate and hold those involved accountable

71
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,990
to give everyone an explanation.

72
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,630
Hold those involved accountable?

73
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,160
Who?

74
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,550
Whoever was the prison warden

75
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,170
should be held accountable.

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,640
What are you trying to say?

77
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,310
As we all know,

78
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,100
the wardens of Huntian Prison

79
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,090
are all selected by Director.

80
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,680
Are you trying to hold Director accountable?

81
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:43,980
Dongfang Yuechu!

82
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,430
The various families of Yiqi Alliance

83
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,270
are discussing an important thing.

84
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,380
You are just an ordinary disciple.

85
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,360
You don't get to kick up a fuss here!

86
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,870
Look.

87
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,010
So humiliated he got angry.

88
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,940
Did I get it right?

89
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:01,830
You...

90
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,950
Director.

91
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,160
What I meant was,

92
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,940
for the escape of the spirits this time,

93
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,670
the director of the Spirit Alliance, Tushan Honghong, is to blame.

94
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,190
Usually, Tushan has no contact with the human race.

95
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,480
Yet on that day, she appeared at

96
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,360
the scene of the spirits escaping Huntian Prison.

97
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,180
It shows that she has something to do with this.

98
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,190
That makes sense.

99
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:36,909
Director.

100
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,750
I saw it with my own eyes that day

101
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,040
at Huntian Prison that

102
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,600
Tushan Honghong extended a helping hand in time.

103
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,260
That's why we managed to stop most evil spirits.

104
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,270
Director.

105
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,750
I can testify.

106
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,830
That makes sense too.

107
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:54,830
Director,

108
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,360
this is a situation she planned to hide her crimes.

109
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,880
Yan Rushan, a disciple of Tushan,

110
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:04,350
used the excuse of abducting women to deceive the people.

111
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,240
But in fact,

112
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,730
he stole the blueprint of Huntian Prison.

113
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,000
There must be something

114
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,040
to do with Tushan Honghong.

115
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,070
All of this

116
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,530
is just your speculation.

117
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,310
You have no evidence.

118
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,580
The two of you are just quarrelling

119
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,880
and are not coming to a conclusion.

120
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,630
Dongfang Yuechu.

121
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,510
In your opinion,

122
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,909
what should we do

123
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,070
about what happened at Huntian Prison?

124
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,000
In my opinion,

125
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,270
we should capture the evil spirit as soon as possible

126
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,530
and interrogate them.

127
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,610
The truth will come to light as to

128
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,270
who planned this then.

129
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,760
That's easy for you to say.

130
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,530
What if we can't catch them?

131
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,090
That's a good point.

132
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,700
As we all know,

133
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,110
the spirits captured in Huntian Prison

134
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,370
are all extremely vicious evil spirits.

135
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,070
It wouldn't be a problem if they were still in the human jurisdiction.

136
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,410
But if they return to the spirit jurisdiction,

137
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,010
we won't be able to capture them in a short time.

138
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,960
In my opinion,

139
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,230
why don't we cooperate with the Spirit Alliance

140
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,760
and capture the evil spirits as soon as possible?

141
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,240
What?

142
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,180
Cooperate with the Spirit Alliance?

143
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,240
Ridiculous!

144
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,560
Enough.

145
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,750
Dongfang Yuechu.

146
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:26,750
Do you know that, since the founding of Yiqi Alliance hundreds of years ago,

147
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,630
you're the first human to propose

148
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,190
cooperating with the Spirit Alliance?

149
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,549
So what?

150
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,200
For this matter,

151
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,720
both humans and spirits want to capture the evil spirits as soon as possible.

152
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,120
Why can't we join forces?

153
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,280
It sounds reasonable.

154
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:43,500
Director.

155
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,840
Even so,

156
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,150
but–

157
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,280
It's settled then.

158
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,720
Dongfang Yuechu.

159
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,440
I'll leave this matter to you.

160
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,220
Lead the disciples of Yiqi Alliance

161
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,630
to join hands with the Spirit Alliance

162
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:58,000
and capture the evil spirits who escaped.

163
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,080
What do you think?

164
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,390
I won't let you down.

165
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:02,710
Director!

166
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,640
It's settled.

167
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,600
No more discussion is needed.

168
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,510
As for the woman abductor,

169
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,750
since he definitely has something to do with this,

170
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,610
Constable Lyu,

171
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,900
arrest him

172
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,790
and interrogate him thoroughly.

173
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:22,600
Yes.

174
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,580
That's all for today's meeting.

175
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,900
You may leave now.

176
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,080
Dongfang Yuechu.

177
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,760
Come with me.

178
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:46,990
[Wangquan Villa]

179
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,390
It's not easy to work with the Spirit Alliance.

180
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,080
One careless move

181
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,250
will get you into trouble.

182
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:03,790
Don't worry.

183
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,090
Normal fire can't burn me.

184
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,480
What puzzles me more is,

185
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,870
you, who used to kill spirits the most,

186
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,790
would agree to cooperate with the Spirit Alliance.

187
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,410
It really surprised me.

188
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,830
Since the establishment of the Spirit Alliance,

189
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:22,640
they have apprehended 163 evil spirits,

190
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,540
and solved 72 conflicts

191
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,660
between humans and spirits.

192
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,460
They also saved 326 humans

193
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,560
from the hands of evil spirits.

194
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,540
Though Yiqi Alliance

195
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,690
was established to deal with spirits,

196
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:36,850
our aim

197
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,430
is still to protect the peace of the people.

198
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,240
So,

199
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,290
if the spirits are doing things that would benefit humans,

200
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,750
you'd be glad about it too.

201
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,370
On the day of the alliance tryout,

202
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,840
you said you wanted to

203
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,600
stop the bad culture of noble families controlling Yiqi Alliance.

204
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,600
You want to stop the noble families.

205
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,490
And I

206
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,450
have been trapped by these noble families

207
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,160
for a lifetime.

208
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,810
Director Wangquan...

209
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,590
Go ahead.

210
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,720
I shall take my leave.

211
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,450
It's windy.

212
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,530
Director, you should go back and rest.

213
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,440
Tell me.

214
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,740
If Gui knows

215
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,980
his father is sick,

216
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,520
will he come to see me?

217
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:02,580
He knows it well.

218
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,980
I'm sure he will understand your difficulties.

219
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:09,970
He will...

220
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:21,210
Wangquan Hongye would like to cooperate with us

221
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,490
to capture the evil spirits.

222
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,870
It's just capturing a few evil spirits.

223
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,960
I can handle it myself.

224
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,290
There's no need to make it so complicated.

225
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,240
Sister, are you serious?

226
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,320
You really want to work with them?

227
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,750
Nangong Shi is the biggest suspect

228
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,930
for what happened at Huntian Prison.

229
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,910
It's just that he's a member of the Yiqi Alliance.

230
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,040
It should be handled by Yiqi Alliance.

231
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,870
This cooperation

232
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,000
will help us take action in the future too.

233
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,610
Okay.

234
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,390
I'll send them a reply now.

235
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,670
It's just that...

236
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,000
There are many noble families in Yiqi Alliance

237
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,600
who are not friendly to the Spirit Alliance.

238
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,560
But now,

239
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,870
their attitude suddenly changed.

240
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:00,580
Well...

241
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,240
Are you worried

242
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,370
there's a conspiracy in this collaboration?

243
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,410
Maybe I am just overthinking.

244
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,290
What happened?

245
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,380
There's news about Chi Sha Bandits.

246
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,840
Go over there!

247
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,080
Hurry up.

248
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,980
Let's split up.

249
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,240
We must catch the culprit.

250
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:31,750
Yes.

251
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,450
Now,

252
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,650
only by redeeming yourself

253
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,760
and finding out the truth as soon as possible

254
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,360
can this chaos be over

255
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,970
and your name cleared.

256
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,670
Lyu Jianwen who is in charge of this case has a keen sense of smell.

257
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:49,240
This is an aura-dispelling pillar that can change your scent.

258
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,060
Wear it.

259
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,560
Don't let her see through you.

260
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,160
Thank you for your reminder.

261
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,000
He's out for women and kills them. It's so scary.

262
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,840
It's been so many days,

263
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,000
why hasn't the woman abductor been captured yet?

264
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,830
Exactly...

265
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,960
Don't worry. Constable Lyu is amazing.

266
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,230
With her on the case,

267
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,670
they will definitely be captured.

268
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:11,520
Don't worry.

269
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,010
They haven't found him yet.

270
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,270
Where can we catch him?

271
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,320
When can we catch him?

272
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,290
[Wanted]

273
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,910
It's so scary.

274
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,960
I dare not go out at night.

275
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,480
Help!

276
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,740
Help! Help!

277
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,160
Thank you.

278
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,720
Thank you for your help.

279
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:52,210
It’s my duty to extend help

280
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:53,890
when I see one in need.

281
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,440
No need to thank me.

282
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:55,970
Thank you.

283
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:56,720
Take him back.

284
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,380
-Yes.
-Yes.

285
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:01,910
Go.

286
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,080
I have the aura-dispelling pillar given by my master.

287
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,910
Don't panic.

288
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:26,000
Could it be that.. the aura-dispelling pillar couldn't change my scent

289
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,860
and she has found out my identity?

290
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,390
Did you use this method to subdue him?

291
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,460
It doesn't seem difficult.

292
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:45,820
That...

293
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,940
That's it? She left?

294
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:52,960
Sir.

295
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,620
Constable Lyu, what brings you here?

296
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,120
I'm here to ask about

297
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,470
the missing woman case.

298
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,930
Did you miss out on any detail?

299
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,690
No.

300
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,010
I've basically said everything.

301
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,630
Thank you.

302
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,240
You're welcome.

303
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,640
Constable Lyu.

304
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,490
Your yogurt.

305
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:27,710
Thank you, sir.

306
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,630
Sir!

307
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,600
One more, please.

308
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,120
Okay!

309
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,200
Sorry.

310
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,930
I want to eat too.

311
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,200
Don't be in a rush!

312
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,380
To be honest,

313
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,530
when I was young, I was part of the martial world.

314
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:50,330
I have offended Chi Sha Bandits.

315
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,120
Now that those evil spirits have escaped,

316
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,680
I’m really worried.

317
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,840
I heard that you are highly skilled

318
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,200
and righteous.

319
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,520
That's why I took the liberty to follow you.

320
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,730
Please forgive me.

321
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,460
Your cultivation level doesn't seem low.

322
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,060
I'm no match against a group.

323
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,680
Why don't you seek protection from the Spirit Alliance?

324
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,940
It's best if I can get protection from the Spirit Alliance.

325
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:19,329
But I'm just a spirit without a clan.

326
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,240
How can I join the Spirit Alliance of Tushan?

327
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,710
If you really want to join them,

328
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:26,990
I have a friend

329
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,350
who can help you connect with them.

330
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,210
Thank you, Constable Lyu.

331
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,750
But

332
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:37,030
I heard that there are many rules in Spirit Alliance.

333
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,510
I'm used to being free.

334
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,440
If I really join Spirit Alliance,

335
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,040
I'm afraid I'll be kicked out in just a few days.

336
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,000
That wouldn't be a good look for your friend.

337
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,280
Looks like Chi Sha Bandits

338
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,210
aren't that much of a threat to you.

339
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,070
Otherwise, with your life on the line,

340
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,870
would you be thinking this much?

341
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,320
Thank you for your reminder.

342
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,040
I would just like to ask for

343
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,830
your kind protection for a few days

344
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,260
before Chi Sha Bandits are captured.

345
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,610
I will never forget

346
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,750
your great kindness.

347
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,830
Sir, your yogurt is here.

348
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,270
Sir,

349
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,040
with fruits, this yogurt

350
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,310
tastes much sweeter.

351
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,860
Miss, you have a good taste.

352
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,020
This is the recipe we learned from Tushan.

353
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,660
It's unique in this market.

354
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:27,650
Thank you, sir.

355
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,740
The dairy is so fragrant.

356
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,120
It's indeed delicious.

357
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,160
Come again.

358
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:36,270
That's enough.

359
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,510
Looking at these,

360
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,070
they are all rough

361
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,550
and powerful.

362
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,640
Judging from the way they wield the sword,

363
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,240
the murderous aura between their eyebrows...

364
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,650
Get to the point.

365
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,130
These female victims

366
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,700
are all descendants of Yiqi Alliance.

367
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,690
What are you trying to say?

368
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,450
Do you think a person's taste

369
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,160
would change so much?

370
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,690
Does that mean someone's trying to mimic them...

371
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,810
These women were not attacked by the woman abductor?

372
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:44,720
That's right.

373
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:48,350
The woman abductor has high standards for the girls' looks.

374
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,150
The women who he takes a liking to

375
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,690
are all fair and beautiful,

376
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,680
and good at poetry and dance.

377
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,030
These girls

378
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,720
are not the woman abductor's type.

379
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,900
How do you know so much about the woman abductor's preference?

380
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,570
I...

381
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,640
I guessed it.

382
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,760
I didn't expect you to be capable of solving cases.

383
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,200
In that case, this woman abductor

384
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,510
is just a superficial spirit who only cares about one's looks.

385
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,350
Well...

386
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,290
Well,

387
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,760
you just took over Divine Flame Villa after all these obstacles.

388
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,160
It's only been a few days.

389
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,930
You're going to Tushan again?

390
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,750
Aunt Yu Ping.

391
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:39,160
Since Yiqi Alliance is the one offering to cooperate this time,

392
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,300
after discussion,

393
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,560
they decided for me

394
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,330
to lead the disciples to Tushan

395
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,910
to show our sincerity.

396
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:49,590
What if Tushan Honghong changes her mind

397
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,160
and doesn't let you leave?

398
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,160
What would you do?

399
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,110
I wish that's the case.

400
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,300
Don't worry. It concerns the cooperation of two alliance.

401
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,970
She will definitely let me go.

402
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:02,640
That's true.

403
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,250
If she doesn't let you go,

404
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,720
I’ll go look for Wangquan Hongye.

405
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,960
Even if I risk my life,

406
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,310
I have to bring you back.

407
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,550
What are you laughing about?

408
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,510
I heard that

409
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,590
the spirits of Chi Sha Bandits

410
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,110
are all cruel

411
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,240
and powerful.

412
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,690
If you really meet them,

413
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:18,820
you must be careful.

414
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,380
Don't worry about it.

415
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,370
Just wait for my triumphant return in the villa.

416
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:36,390
What?

417
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:40,170
The representative Yiqi Alliance sent over is that brat?

418
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,240
Are you kidding me?

419
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,690
Honghong has long forgotten

420
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,410
that he exists.

421
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,960
If they meet

422
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,910
and notice something wrong,

423
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,790
it doesn't matter what he thinks,

424
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,390
but Honghong is the problem.

425
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,670
I'm worried about this too.

426
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,830
Although Honghong has sacrificed her Love Seed,

427
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,430
and can't fall in love again,

428
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,510
she can't remember what happened in the past.

429
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,510
If Yuechu reminds Honghong

430
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:04,350
of the feelings they had in the past,

431
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,080
she will definitely become weak

432
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,340
and endanger her life.

433
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,790
Now,

434
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,130
Honghong and Dongfang Luo

435
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,830
are out investigating the traces of Chi Sha Bandits.

436
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,440
We can hold it back for a few more days.

437
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,060
But when they come back,

438
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,830
with that brat's personaliy,

439
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,720
what if he...

440
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,110
Rongrong, you've always been smart.

441
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,310
Can you think of a way

442
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:24,910
to stop them from meeting?

443
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:39,610
♫Can you go to the battlefield of fate with me again?♫

444
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,090
♫Can I play you a farewell song again?♫

445
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:49,050
♫The scene in my dream looks towards you♫

446
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,300
♫Like ice-cold moonlight on the water♫

447
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,880
♫Like fog dormant on the hills♫

448
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:02,830
♫Like holding it in my palms but letting it go gently♫

449
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:08,960
♫Like wind surging with the waves♫

450
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,000
Brat.

451
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,310
Yaya!

452
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,550
You've been ticking me off!

453
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,470
♫Like light refracting illusions♫

454
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,550
I-I-I didn't mean to do that!

455
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:11,920
Come here!

456
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,070
Lady Fairy, save me!

457
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:13,350
Stop!

458
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:17,850
♫Like shadows reflecting the young self♫

459
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:25,460
♫The old days are like a dream♫

♫Hiding my delusions in the dark♫

461
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:33,520
♫To guard the Grief Tree♫

462
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:37,800
♫Do you know I've been hesitant because of love?♫

463
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:41,390
♫Do you know I've been lost because of hatred?♫

464
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:44,280
♫Where do the different paths lead to?♫

465
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,480
Yuechu,

466
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,370
why are you just standing here?

467
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:50,470
♫Looking into the dreamland, in the direction you went♫

468
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,280
Let's go.

469
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,450
Let me show you a new world,

470
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,690
and have a look around Spirit Market.

471
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:01,930
I have to say,

472
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,460
I didn't expect

473
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,750
the spirit clan

474
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,640
to have such a bustling market too.

475
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,240
Right?

476
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,670
Sir, this is yours. Enjoy.

477
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,720
Thank you.

478
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,810
Sirs,

479
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,170
these are yours.

480
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,230
Sir.

481
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,580
We didn't order these.

482
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,920
Yuechu.

483
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,850
Look who's here!

484
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:23,720
You've come a long way with the disciples.

485
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,970
Take these snacks and drinks

486
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,590
for your disciples.

487
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,720
Rongrong.

488
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,310
Don't worry.

489
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,210
This debt

490
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,580
will be under the name of Yiqi Alliance.

491
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,240
Rongrong.

492
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,730
It's been so many years,

493
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,550
you are still as calculative.

494
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,750
Thank you.

495
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,710
Look.

496
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,260
Wh-What color is this wine?

497
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,920
Look at the color of this wine.

498
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,310
Can you drink it?

499
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,490
What are you talking about?

500
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,200
If you aren't drinking, give it back to me.

501
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:48,590
What are you doing?

502
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,140
Give it to me.

503
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:49,540
You...

504
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,130
Stop! Stop right there!

505
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,450
Niu.

506
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,540
It's been so many years,

507
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,010
why is your temper still so as quick?

508
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,200
You haven't changed a bit.

509
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,680
Give it to me if they don't want it. I will drink it.

510
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,440
Come on.

511
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,900
I'm doing this for you.

512
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,310
Otherwise,

513
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,790

I met them here the day before yesterday.

536

Just because I took a second look at them, they attacked me.

537

If I hadn't pretended to be dead and escaped them,

538
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,640

You want me to be an enemy to Tushan?

It's not that I want you to do that,

It's nothing.

684
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,350
What is this?

685
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,530
An invitation from Yiqi Alliance.

686
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:32,120
You can

687
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,790
handle this.

688
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:34,710
Yes.

689
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,210
Who is the representative

690
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:43,040
Yiqi Alliance sent over this time?

691
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,780
Someone from Divine Flame Villa.

692
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,030
Dongfang Yuechu?

693
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,000
Sister.

694
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,600
You know this name?

695
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,570
Nangong Shi mentioned him before.

696
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:01,890
Do you want to see him?

697
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,840
No need.

698
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,840
He had contact with Nangong Shi privately.

699
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,690
Send Elder to follow them.

700
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,510
Sure.

701
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:26,230
I knew you wouldn't come empty-handed.

702
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,270
This chicken is good.

703
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:31,639
Delicious.

704
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,760
Look at you. You've become

705
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,889
the representative of Yiqi Alliance.

706
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,030
Look at your clothes.

707
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:42,030
Look at your aura.

708
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,510
I have said this,

709
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,139
that humans will always be humans.

710
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,300
Even if us foxes raise them–

711
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:50,489
Just eat your food.

712
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:53,130
Stop nagging. Why do you have so much to say?

713
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,170
This darned old fox.

714
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,900
I've used so many tricks

715
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,810
but I just can't get rid of him.

716
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:08,720
Pour me a drink!

717
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,230
Pour me a drink.

718
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,580
You can't bear to part with your wine?

719
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,580
Don't forget,

720
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,110
you've stolen a lot of wine from me all these years.

721
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,240
Get it straight.

722
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,420
Half of your wine was stolen by Honghong.

723
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,990
Don't talk nonsense.

724
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,280
How can you call her Honghong?

725
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:30,510
Besides,

726
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,730
she has more wine than me.

727
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:34,520
Why would she steal my wine?

728
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,920
Don't try to frame her.

729
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:38,370
That's because you don't know her at all.

730
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:41,900
Sure.

731
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,280
You know her well.

732
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,800
So what?

733
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,280
Drink up.

734
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:55,170
Si Xi!

735
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,700
Come on.

736
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,200
What are you waiting for?

737
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,360
Drink a toast to the Elder. Hurry up.

738
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,360
Come on.

739
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,320
Cheers. Cheers.

740
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,480
Come on.

741
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:04,920
Here's to you.

742
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,630
You guys.

743
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,440
Come here.

744
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,320
Come drink a toast to him.

745
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:07,920
Yes.

746
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,280
Come on.

747
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,320
Elder.

748
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,480
A toast to the Elder! Cheers!

749
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,370
Come on.

750
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:14,280
Come on.

751
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,400
Drink more.

752
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:17,830
Here, I’ll drink it up.

753
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:18,550
Good wine.

754
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:19,680
Fill it up for Elder.

755
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:20,930
Drink.

756
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,240
You two.

757
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,300
Come out!

758
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,600
Why are you hiding from me?

759
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,520
We're not.

760
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,360
Yes, we aren't.

761
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:50,920
You aren't?

762
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,960
Good.

763
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,260
Let me ask you.

764
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,230
Has

765
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,680
Dongfang Luo been pestering Chief?

766
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,670
No.

767
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,050
No?

768
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,140
How is that possible?

769
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:10,350
Chief is the one pestering Dongfang Luo.

770
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,330
Yes.

771
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,510
Every morning, Chief would

772
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,980
come to Twin Peaks to look for Dongfang Luo.

773
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:25,720
[Zhilan Garden]

774
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:29,050
Yuechu!

775
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,930
You're finally awake.

776
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,930
Where's Yuechu?

777
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,230
Where did he go?

778
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:39,820
He...

779
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,200
He went to catch evil spirits.

780
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:43,360
Catch evil spirits?

781
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:46,450
No.

782
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:49,170
Something must have happened to him.

783
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:51,380
-I need to save him.
-No.

784
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,610
You just survived.

785
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,880
You haven't recovered yet.

786
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,140
You can't go anywhere.

787
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:59,540
But I just dreamed that his heart was bleeding.

788
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,440
He told me he was in pain.

789
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,440
Don't worry.

790
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,000
He

791
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,880
is collaborating with Tushan Honghong to catch the spirits.

792
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,080
Nothing will happen.

793
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,560
He went to see her again?

794
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:15,530
This time,

795
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,640
Director ordered him to work with the Spirit Alliance

796
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,960
on behalf of Yiqi Alliance.

797
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,610
It's not on his own accord.

798
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:23,280
Whether he took the initiative or not,

799
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,160
he's only going to suffer again.

800
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,010
Tushan Honghong has ignored him for three years.

801
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:33,080
Why doesn’t he understand?

802
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:02,790
Chief.

803
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,960
How have you been?

804
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:10,390
Dongfang Yuechu?
