You'll die today.

176
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:04,520
What's this?

177
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,870
This is Tushan's protection spell.

178
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:11,030
You're going to the Human Market tomorrow.

179
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,290
If something happens,

180
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,460
this spell

181
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,920
can protect you from one attack.

182
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,120
With your current cultivation,

183
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,720
you should be able to escape.

184
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,800
Damned brat.

185
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,240
He escaped again.

186
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,870
I sense Dongfang Blood on you.

187
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,260
You work for Jin Renfeng, don't you?

188
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,800
I need you to take a message to him.

189
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,880
He can twist the truth,

190
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,040
but he can't conceal it forever.

191
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,010
He got everything he has now by stealing.

192
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,410
I'll make him pay one day.

193
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,190
I'll give him a taste of being deserted by everyone

194
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,810
and displaced from his home.

195
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:30,880
Dad.

196
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,240
Mom.

197
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:35,120
I killed Tiger and Crane Immortals today.

198
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,600
I've taken half revenge for you.

199
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,120
I

200
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,910
also planted an orchid secretly.

201
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,280
But it never sprouted.

202
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,790
My mom told me

203
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,010
that in Divine Flame Villa,

204
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,460
there was an orchid

205
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,810
that was planted when she was born.

206
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,720
She often thought of it

207
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:18,660
but never got to go back to check on it.

208
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,950
After you take back Divine Flame Villa,

209
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:27,030
you can check on it for her.

210
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,750
Didn't you come to the Human Market this time

211
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,830
to seek revenge on Jin Renfeng?

212
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,330
You meant to let me out for revenge?

213
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,790
No.

214
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,080
You used me to lure out Jin Renfeng

215
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,550
because you wanted to deal with him too.

216
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,030
You're not that dumb.

217
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,650
But over the years,

218
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,830
Divine Flame Villa and Tushan

219
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,620
have stayed out of each other's way.

220
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,330
Why?

221
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,740
Anyway,

222
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,720
I don't object to you taking revenge on Jin Renfeng.

223
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,270
It's just that you must not act rashly.

224
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,270
Jin Renfeng is also Tushan's enemy.

225
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,100
You have to know that Jin Renfeng was just a beggar at first.

226
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,070
But in the end, he's gained Dongfang Blood

227
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:11,030
and taken control of Divine Flame Villa.

228
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,360
It's not because he has high cultivation,

229
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,950
but because he's scheming,

230
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,440
ruthless,

231
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,650
and patient.

232
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,160
You're right.

233
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,310
I'm too weak to take on him now.

234
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,800
Only when I am strong enough

235
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,710
can I tear off his hypocritical mask myself.

236
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,120

237
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,310
Yaya.

238
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:51,170
Did you patrol the mountains all night again?

239
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:54,300
Honghong is not around. It's my duty to keep Tushan safe.

240
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,600
You can't even get two hours' sleep a day,

241
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,460
guarding Tushan like a fortress.

242
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,960
If Honghong knows it,

243
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:01,330
she'll be relieved.

244
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,160
She and the others will come back soon, right?

245
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,830
Yeah, in a day or two.

246
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,530
It's all that brat's fault.

247
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,390
He couldn't even collect debts.

248
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,120
He was always dilly-dallying.

249
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,920
I wonder if Honghong can rest well outside.

250
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,200
Yaya.

251
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,960
Why don't you go back for some rest?

252
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,830
You can resume patrolling later.

253
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,880
No way.

254
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,310
Back then,

255
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,500
when Honghong protected us

256
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,420
from that evil monster,

257
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,450
I swore

258
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,590
to protect whatever Honghong

259
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,010
wanted to protect.

260
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,100
I gotta go.

261
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,130
I'll go take a look around again.

262
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,800

264
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,670
can protect Tushan too.

265
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,310
Okay.

266
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,400
You asked me to stay in the human clan

267
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,880
and said you needed to do something

268
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,410
just to come to this market?

269
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,000
Lady Fairy, since we're already here,

270
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,680
just think of it as revisiting an old place with me.

271
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,740
I won't do it again.

272

I didn't expect this market

273
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,170
to become much livelier than when I was a kid.

274

Everything is fine.

But there's one thing

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,600
you need to decide on.

What is it?

315
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,110
According to the custom of Tushan,

316
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:54,520
there's a matchmaking event once every 100 years,

317
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,520
so that those spirits with true love

318
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,600
can ask for a Feathered Flower under the Grief Tree,

319

in order to protect their relationship.

320

It won't be long

before this event is due.

322
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,000
It will be held as scheduled.

323
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,770
But...

324
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,960
I know.

325
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:10,040
You're worried that the spirits will find out

326
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,640
the secret about how

327
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,880
the Grief Tree has been infested by Dark Force.

328
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,380
But if we postpone it,

329
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:17,400
how do you think they'll react?

330
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,790
I see.

331
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:23,390
I suppose you have another consideration.

332
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:25,980
The Grief Tree will bear flowers for the spirits

333
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,210
and help them form relationships.

334
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:29,830
However, these relationships will also in turn feed the Grief Tree

335
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,690
and enhance its spiritual power.

336
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,000
You want to hold this event

337
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:37,400
so that more relationships can feed the Grief Tree,

338
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,680
and fight against the Dark Force from inside.

Not yet.

346
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,540
What's wrong?

347
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,600
Why is it that after practicing so many times,

348
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,800
the repercussions get worse and worse?

349
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,440
Lady Fairy.

350
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,540
What happened?

351
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,130
This is...

352
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,100
Give me your hand.

353
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,130
Why are you so anxious for results?

354
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,770
I want to practice hard and improve my Purest Sun Flame

355
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:19,480
to the next level as soon as possible.

356
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,440
Only in this way

357
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,900
I can deal with Jin Renfeng

358
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,480
when I meet him again.

359
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:25,480
The more hasty you are, the more you won't reach your goal.

360
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,640
To cultivate Purest Sun Flame, you need to mobilize the spiritual blood in your whole body.

361
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,550
It's a tough test on your vascular system.

362
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,210
If you break through by force,

363
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,770
it will only hurt your heart

364
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:34,970
and damage your body.

365
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,370
But...

366
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,400
Don't be anxious.

367
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:41,590
This time, a part of his wings has been removed.

368
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,500
If we keep going at it,

369
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:46,610
there'll be a time when we get rid of him completely.

370
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,680
Next time,

371
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,360
don't let me see your impatience again.

372
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,580
Okay.

373
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,030
Looks like I need another way

374
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:05,250
if I want to quickly improve my cultivation.

375
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,080
The Dinghai Rod and Thousand Spirit Spell?

376
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:21,240
Back then, Aolai Sanshao used it

377
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,240
to draw the inner and outer circles.

378
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,890
How did you find such a realistic imitation

379
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:31,170
of Dinghai Rod?

380
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,810
If you put in both time and effort,

381
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,870
you'll get lucky one day too.

382
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,450
My dear Yuechu,

383
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,670
there're still some things you want to learn about exorcism,

384
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:42,430
right?

385
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,700
I'm afraid you have to devote even more time,

386
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:49,230
besides answering my previous questions.

387
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,020
What would it take for you to give me Dinghai Rod?

388
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,110
Help me practice my exorcism move to a higher level.

389
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,690
This is from Aolai Sanshao.

390
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,460
The strongest spirit there is.

391
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,710
Many people wanted it but never got it.

392
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:12,740
Forget it if you don't want it.

393
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,420
Wait.

394
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,270
Deal.

[The sweet floral fragrance of Aolai, executing the Thousand Spirit Spell with Dinghai Rod]

It’s him!

He's the only handsome man in the world.

399

What about the other spells of Tushan?

400
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,060
I'll teach!

401
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:46,540
A human?

402
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,180
How dare you!

403
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,400
How dare you act recklessly in Tushan?

404
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,600
Damned human beings.

405
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:56,920
Let go of me!

406
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,330
You don't know me?

407
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,060
So,

408
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,960
you're the white fox they found?

409
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,010
I know you were bullied by the human race.

410
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,870
I'm different from other humans.

411
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,200
Be nice to me.

412

00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,200
You came to me

418
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,610
just to ask me

419
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,530
to ban the human race in Tushan?

420
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,110
Chief,

421
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,740
Tushan is the home of our fox clan.

422
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,400
We shouldn't have let the humans come here.

423
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,860
We shouldn't let them do whatever they want.

424
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,180
The only human allowed within Tushan

425
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,490
will only be Yuechu.

426
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,330
I spent time with the human race in my early years.

427
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:59,270
So, I know they're treacherous and cunning.

428
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,890
They can do anything

429
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,510
for their own selfish desires.

430
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,840
They are even more cruel

431
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,270
and vicious than wolves.

There's nothing for you here.

Get out.

437

I've only heard of clingy dogs.

438
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,920
I've actually never seen a clingy fox before.

00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,260
Only two spirits who

516
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:10,320
are in love with each other

517
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:12,270
can get a Feathered Flower each,

518
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,250
and be protected by the Grief Tree.

519
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:18,030
Can humans ask for a Feathered Flower from the Grief Tree too?

520
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,460
This Grief Tree

521
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,250
is the sacred tree of love within our Spirit Clan.

522
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,170
So far,

523
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:33,320
no human has ever obtained a flower.

524
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:37,600
However,

525
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:40,080
why are you suddenly asking this?

526
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,800
Is there...

527
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,060
a spirit you like?

528
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:45,650
Go away. Don't speculate.

529
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,360
So you are saying,

530
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,510
Yuechu is asking if humans can ask for a Feathered Flower?

531
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,240
Yes.

532
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,440
As a human,

533
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,770
he'll not be loyal to us spirits after all.

534
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,830
The matchmaking event is no small matter.

535
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:00,630
I’m worried he’s up to something,

536
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:02,480
so I came to report to you.

537
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,880
Apart from this,

538
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,920
is there anything else?

539
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,480
No.

540
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,760
Okay.

541
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,800
Keep following him.

542
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,150
Yes.

543
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,760
I won’t let you down, Chief.

544
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:28,190
I wanted Guoguo to have more contact with Yuechu,

545
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:30,360
so that he can resolve his resentment against the human race.

546
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,620
I didn't expect his hatred to run so deep.

547
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,680
It's up to him

548
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,900
to break free from it.

549
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,670
But why is Yuechu...

550
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,420
asking if a human can ask for a Feathered Flower?

551
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,670
You like this mask too?

552
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,750
Lady Fairy...

553
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,760
Why do I keep thinking

554
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,920
about her for no good reason?

555
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:45,820
When I see Lady Fairy later,

556
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,920
the first thing I'll say is,

557
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:49,550
"Lady Fairy,

558
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,920
I heard that you have not been well recently,

559
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,190
so I came to visit you."

560
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,360
No.

561
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,230
That's too polite.

562
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,340
Lady Fairy,

563
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,000
I painstakingly made this chicken soup with

564
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,330
lots of premium ingredients I had bought.

565
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:08,050
That sounded like I was emphasizing money.

566
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,000
How should I put it?

567
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,840
Come in.

568
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:15,760
Coming.

569
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,800
What do you want from me at this hour?

570
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,960
Lady Fairy, chicken soup.

571
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,550
Thank you.

572
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,560
But before the matchmaking event,

573
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I cannot eat meat.

574
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,100
So, I can't drink your soup.

575
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:40,830
Take it back.

576
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,510
Okay.

577
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,920
Lady Fairy, I have something important to tell you.

578
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,650
Last time, Jin Renfeng failed.

579
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,390
He's not going to let it go.

580
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:55,960
Tushan will hold a matchmaking event soon.

581
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,760
At that time,

582
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,590
there will be a large number of foreign spirits who'll be coming in.

583
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,390
I'm afraid he'll try to sneak in,

584
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:02,370
to harm Tushan.

585
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,390
That's right.

586
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,960
As long as the Jin Renfeng is alive,

587
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,610
he'll always remain a threat to Tushan.

588
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:11,390
But Tushan can't stay in perpetual fear

589
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:14,080
and give up on our normal lives because of him.

590
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,920
In that case,

591
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:19,490
can I join the preparation?

592
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:22,380
I've been in Tushan for so many years.

593
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,190
Besides,

594
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:27,210
it's my duty to guard against Jin Renfeng.

595
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,760
If you want to,

596
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,850
go and help Yaya and Rongrong.

597
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:34,280
Okay.

598
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:35,850
It's late.

599
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,590
If there's nothing else,

600
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:38,330
go back.

601
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,030
Greetings, Spirit Lord.

602
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,190
You were unsuccessful

603
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:09,640
at the Human Market.

604
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:10,550
I...

605
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:11,960
made a mistake.

606
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,520
Do you remember what I said when I asked you to work with me?

607
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,130
Three chances.

608
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:20,440
You've already lost one.

609
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:24,230
The matchmaking event of Tushan is around the corner.

610
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:26,400
I need you to do something for me.

611
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:28,570
Well...

612
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,320
That won't be easy.

613
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,440
Does that mean

614
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,670
you can’t do it?

615
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,270
I’ll definitely try my best.

616
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:40,710
But that Tushan Honghong is a powerful spirit.

617
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,620
I'm worried...

618
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,280
Don't worry.

619
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,550
I know how to deal with her.

620
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,630
But speaking of which,

621
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,190
her weakness

622
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:53,190
has something to do with your Divine Flame Villa.

623
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,680
The matchmaking event...
