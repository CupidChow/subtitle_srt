00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,370
Tushan has nothing to do with you now.

5
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,400
Have you barged in without permission…

6
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,000
because you have a death wish?

7
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,610
Back then, what deal

8
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,870
did you make with my mom?

9
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,390
Did you save me

10
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,400
out of pity

11
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,190
or because you wanted to use Dongfang Blood

12
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,520
to save the Grief Tree?

13
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,910
I'll just be honest with you.

14
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,310
I made a deal with Dongfang Qinlan back then.

15
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,420
Tushan would protect her,

16
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,460
and she'd give her spiritual blood to Tushan in return.

17
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,550
Now that she's dead,

18
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,120
you, as her son, should honor the deal for her.

19
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,010
So the Heaven & Earth Thread wasn't for protecting me.

20
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,960
You were worried that I'll run away

21
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,090
and couldn't be sacrificed when it's necessary, right?

22
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,600
That deal was made with mutual consent.

23
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,160
All this time,

24
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,270
Tushan has never forced you to do anything.

25
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,680
Then why did you save me when Elder tried to sacrifice me?

26
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,940
At this point,

27
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,430
do you still think I saved you?

28
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,720
After all that's happened,

29
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,510
I really regret stopping Elder that day.

30
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:21,950
It turns out…

31
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,810
It turns out I was wrong from the very beginning.

32
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,980
I was so wrong.

33
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,710
With the surname Dongfang

34
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,340
comes a price.

35
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,850
Why did you lie to me?

36
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,230
I've got used to them coming at me

37
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:47,950
and trying to kill me,

38
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,500
but I've never thought

39
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,010
all you want is just my blood too.

40
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,590
In this world,

41
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,560
everyone is wearing a mask.

42
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,170
It's ridiculous of you to tear the mask off

43
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,330
and ask people if they really care.

44
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,089
Don't you get it?

45
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,390

48

I don't want your love.

49

51
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,330
You buried him yourself.

From here on out,

53
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,350
we're just strangers.

55

died today.

56

Thank you for saving me with your heart back then.

57
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,390
I've sealed the remaining half

58
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,460
of your heart.

59
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
After all,

60
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,920
it's not time for you to die yet.

No matter what,

We agreed to go to the Grief Tree for its blessing today.

69
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,390
Are you having second thoughts?

70
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,940
No, I'm not.

71
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:06,950
Really?

72
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,480
Then why did you try to chase after Director Dongfang?

73
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,630
You got me wrong.

74
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,560
I just wanted to tell him

75
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:16,700
it was indeed the Ximen family who stole the Seven-Treasures Bark

76
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,360
and caused you tree spirits to lose your magic tool.

So,

80
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,020
you chased him for me?

81
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,750
Not entirely.

82
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,470
I need to tell him the truth

83
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,750
to clear the air as well.

84
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,659
Aren't you afraid that he'll hold you accountable?

Well, I…

But

88
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,800
getting the blessing is more important.

89

We can tell the director later.

could save the tree?

You're wrong.

109

But…

140
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,390
The black energy is none of your business.

141
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,240
Your duty is to protect Tushan.

142
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,200
My mom said

143
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,290
if a couple is truly in love,

144
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:36,090
the Grief Tree will give them Feathered Flowers as a blessing.

145

But

if a human and a spirit are in love,

147
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,670
will they get Feathered Flowers too?

148
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,160
I don't know.

149
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,390
But we'll just follow the third-ranking chief's instructions

150
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,520
and pray earnestly.

151

00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,960
please give us Feathered Flowers

174
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,690
and bless us.

175
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,790
How touching!

176
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:11,680
Unfortunately, this Grief Tree can't bless you.

177
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,440
Are you alright?

178
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,470
Who on earth are you?

179
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:24,670
Why did you attack us?

180
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
What a fool.

181
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,640
How haven't you come around yet?

182
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:32,240
The tree spirit beside you

183
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,950
just wants

184
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:37,510
the Seven-Treasures Bark on you.

185
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,660
It's the tree spirits' magic tool,

186
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,440
and it has acknowledged you,

187
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,000
Hu Weisheng, as its master.

188
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,360
It's right on your back.

189
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,500
She's brought you here

190
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,480
because she can't take it by force

191
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,780
and has to trick you into loving her

192
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:58,670
so that you'll give it to her willingly.

193
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,790
Is what he said true?

194
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:04,910
I have

195
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,450
the Seven-Treasures Bark on me?

196
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,380
It's all because of the Seven-Treasures Bark, right?

197
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,200
That's not true.

198
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,270
Let me explain.

199
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,170
Yueti Xia.

200
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,880
Weisheng.

201
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,600
What have you done to her?

202
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,900
I just used some rootless water

203
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,650
to make her show her true form

204
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,869
and become unable to turn into human form again.

205
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:10,020
This scheming woman approached you

206
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,839
to make you fall in love with her.

207
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:13,790
Only when you're in love with her

208
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:16,560
will the Seven-Treasures Bark fall off you

209
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:18,390
and acknowledge her as its master.

210
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,910
You hate her guts, don't you?

211
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:23,740
How about I avenge you?

212
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,130
No!

213
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,550
It's useless.

214
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,670
The Seven-Treasures Bark on your back will protect you

215
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,330
from the heavenly lightning.

216
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,340
You can't protect her.

217
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,390
You fool.

218
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,400
Back off.

219
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,360
Impossible.

220
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,060
I said I'll protect her.

221
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,560
Okay. Then give it a try.

222
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,130
No!

223
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:20,490
No.

224
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,620
The Seven-Treasures Bark.

225
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,150
The Seven-Treasures Bark.

226
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,370
You want the Seven-Treasures Bark, right?

227
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,930
I'll give it to you. Take it.

228
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,440
No.

229
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,240
Go!

230
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:36,880
Go!

231
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,710
Tell me.

232
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,730
How can I give her the Seven-Treasures Bark?

233
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,300
Think it over.

234
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,720
There's only one Seven-Treasures Bark.

235
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,240
You have to die if you give it to her.

236
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,390
Are you really willing to die

237
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,840
for such a hypocritical liar?

238
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,790
No.

239
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,510
No matter what,

240
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,510
I can't let her die!

241
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:11,880
Okay.

242
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,660
I'll tell you.

243
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,440
You have to love her.

244
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,090
You have to love her

245
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,850
to make the Seven-Treasures Bark fall off you

246
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,800
and acknowledge her as its master.

247
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,330
Don't love me.

248
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:35,480
Don't.

249
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:37,620
Sorry.

250
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,600
I don't know how to give the Bark to you.

251
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,550
No.

252
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:48,920
So,

253
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,310
don't lie ever again, okay?

Outside the circle, there's only hate but no love.

288
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:01,290
Is this love

289
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,750
that only exists in the circle?

290
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,680
It actually gave a coward the courage

291
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:09,510
to sacrifice his life.

292
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,160
Chief.

293
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,550
Chief.

294
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,390
Please save him.

295
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,720
Please save him.

296
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,450
Save him, will you?

297
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,320
The Black Fox called down the heavenly lightning with hatred.

298
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,860
I can't save him.

299
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,230
You…

300
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,640
-Don't go.
-Let go of me!

301
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,630
Feathered Flowers.

302
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,500
Feathered Flowers are blooming.

303
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,640
Has the Grief Tree sensed their love?

304
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,440
Yueti Xia.

305
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:55,830
Hu Weisheng.

306
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:59,760
The Grief Tree has seen true love in you.

307
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,680
You two are attached now.

308
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,610
So what?

309
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,440
He'll never wake up.

310
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,200
He'll never know how much I love him.

311
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,270
The Grief Tree will make your story resume.

312
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:24,120
You'll meet him again.

313
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,680
Really?

314
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,550
Trust the Grief Tree.

315
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,470
Believe in love.

316
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,060
I have to

317
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,870
put an end to this as soon as possible.

318
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,590
No one should get hurt again.

319
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,990
Your plan failed?

320
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:48,870
Hu Weisheng died for Yueti Xia.

321
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:54,880
Can't believe the Black Fox henchman is fallible too.

322
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,660
That human loved that tree spirit

323
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,360
and protected her from the heavenly lightning called down by hatred.

324
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,360
There's no love outside the circle.

325
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,040
You once lived in the circle.

326
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,780
Do you know

327
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,200
what on earth love is?

328
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,530
Can love

329
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,310
really defend against the heavenly lightning?

330
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,010
For love,

331
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,750
it's hard.

332
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,880
But for hatred, it's so easy.

333
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:26,120
In people's blood run selfishness,

334
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,550
greed,

335
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:29,110
and resentment.

336
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:33,790
Every one of them is enough to arouse hatred.

337
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,110
In this world,

338
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:39,260
hatred

339
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,170
is the most powerful.

340
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,550
How is Tushan Honghong absorbing

341
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,880
the hatred in her body?

342
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,660
How do you know Black Fox Empress's plan?

343
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,890
I've been working with her for a long time.

344
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,260
Since we're partners, how would she hide it from me?

345
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:11,910
Hatred is increasing rapidly in Tushan Honghong.

346
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,640
After she's consumed by hatred

347
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,650
and has black Feathered Flowers all over her body,

348
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:18,510
she'll completely lose herself.

349
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:19,750
By then,

350
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,260
the Empress can get through the barriers

351
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,750
and come into the circle.

352
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:39,050
There's black energy in Huguang Pavilion?

353
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:40,490
Somehow,

354
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,560
Honghong seems reluctant to talk about it.

355
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,880
Besides,

356
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:49,200
her temperament has changed a lot.

357
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,240
No wonder I was always turned away

358
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:54,080
when I went to see her recently.

359
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,440
She must've accidentally fallen into Shi Ji's trap.

360
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,700
We have to check on her.

361
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,880
I advise you to leave her alone.

362
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,250
Lai?

363
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:05,260
You know something, don't you?

364
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,290
Tell us,

365
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,130
what's going on with Honghong?

366
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,230
Chief is absorbing hatred.

367
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:17,740
Only when she has enough hatred in her body

368
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,500
can she give orders to Black Foxes

369
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,230
and find a way to get rid of them.

370
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,730
Will hatred

371
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:24,820
affect her mind?

372
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,480
Yes.

373
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,640
When her hatred is intense enough,

374
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,640
her mind

375
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,060
is very likely to be controlled by it.

376
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,270
Since you already knew it,

377
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,750
why didn't you stop her?

378
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,140
Honghong has made up her mind.

379
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,210
No one can stop her.

380
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,690
I can't let her take such risks.

381
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,850
Stop persuading me.

382
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:58,910
Honghong.

383
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,760
Hatred will consume your mind. It's very dangerous.

384
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,160
Even if you don't care for yourself,

385
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,320
you have to think about humans and spirits.

386
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,550
Given how powerful you are,

387
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,210
if you lose control in the end,

388
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,940
the consequences will be unimaginable.

389
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:12,400
As I said,

390
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,560
just do your jobs.

391
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:15,930
As for the rest,

392
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,720
I'll take care of it.

393
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,090
Honghong.

394
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:21,720
Yaya and I have always listened to you,

395
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,340
but too much is at stake this time.

396
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,190
You have to tell us your plan honestly

397
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,080
so that Yaya and I can help you.

398
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,850
I'll tell you

399
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,370
when it's time.

400
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:38,590
Hong…

401
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,980
You two think

402
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:47,530
I'll be controlled by hatred

403
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,560
and kill innocent creatures?

404
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,290
No.

405
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,220
I believe that you'll never hurt the innocent

406
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,550
no matter what happens.

407
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,290
Since that's the case,

408
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,780
you should get out.

409
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:58,430
Get out!

410
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,950
[Divine Flame Villa]

411
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,510
Show yourself.

412
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,550
I have no patience

413
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:33,910
for people I hate.

414
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,900
Say what you got to say.

415
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,070
Then get lost.

416
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:42,020
You were hellbent on killing me whenever you met me before,

417
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,740
but you just asked me to leave this time.

418
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:48,370
It seems that you're grateful to me

419
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,140
for tipping you off.

420
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,360
No more crap, or I'll kill you.

421
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,480
As the director of the Yiqi Alliance,

422
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,650
aren't you curious about

423
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,520
how these Black Foxes enter the circle?

424
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,720
Don't you want to foil Tushan's plot?

425
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,620
I can tell you the truth.

426
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,710
Those Black Foxes before

427
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,620
entered the circle through the heart

428
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,230
of Tushan's Grief Tree.

429
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:25,010
It's all the conspiracy of Tushan Honghong.

430
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:27,230
She used you

431
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:30,340
to establish the Spirit Alliance step by step

432
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,870
and cooperate with humans.

433
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:35,680
Then she let Black Foxes ruin the cooperation.

434
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:39,230
It's because she's long coveted

435
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,650
the hatred that can wreak havoc on the six realms.

436
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,680
What are you getting at?

437
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,000
Work with me.

438
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,430
Let's get rid of Tushan and Black Foxes together.

439
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,030
What do you think?

440
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:02,610
You want to turn against Black Foxes?

441
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,520
Do you think

442
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:08,750
I'll just watch Black Fox Empress rule inside the circle?

443
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,970
I just want to unify the six realms.

444
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,130
That's all.

445
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,430
You said so much,

446
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,410
but you just want to use me

447
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,660
to deal with Tushan.

448
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,240
Think whatever you want.

449
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,270
But Tushan Honghong

450
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:32,600
has joined forces with Black Fox Empress.

451
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,510
As the director of the Yiqi Alliance,

452
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,240
how can you stand idly by?

453
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,050
Once they rule the six realms,

454
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,100
humans will be under their thumb.

455
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,520
It'll be too late then.

456
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,270
So what?

457
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,220
You've long sided with Black Fox Empress.

458
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,000
You can do whatever it takes to rule the six realms.

459
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,270
Why can't she?

460
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:10,630
Director Dongfang,

461
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,360
after loving Tushan Honghong for such a long time,

462
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,590
you find it hard to accept it.

463
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,090
I understand.

464
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,400
It's fine.

465
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,820
I'll give you three days.

466
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,460
Think carefully.

467
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,080
Who is your enemy,

468
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,670
and who is your friend?
