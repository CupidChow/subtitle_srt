1
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,760
Have you counted

2
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:29,039
the tributes the court paid?

3
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:30,280
And the lands ceded?

4
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,119
But we've had peace these years.

5
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,080
It's still worth it.

6
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:34,319
True.

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,119
Are you convinced?

8
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:39,559
Let's drink.

9
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:43,000
Are you convinced or not?

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,320
We're strangers crossing paths

11
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,640
who had casual chatting.

12
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,240
Don't take it seriously.

13
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,840
I returned home and pondered.

14
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:57,920
The more I thought,
the angrier I became.

15
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,799
The peace treaty has lasted decades.

16
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,239
The realm has stability.

17
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:15,000
(Liu Baogen, Comb Artisan of Zijin Hall)
Like your kind,

18
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,359
(Liu Tianshui, Jade Artisan of Zijin Hall)
the fewer, the better.

19
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,680
Cowardly peace secures no realm.

20
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,319
And you dare call it 'stability'?

21
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:22,719
People like you

22
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:23,840
are what we need less of!

23
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:24,999
What did you say?

24
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:27,359
Then who exactly are you

25
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,400
to the Chai family?

26
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,680
(Tie Sen, the Chai family's warrior)
Tie Sen.

27
00:01:44,787 --> 00:01:47,104
(Ouyang Feng,
Second Manor Lord of Baituo Manor)

28
00:01:56,272 --> 00:01:57,472
You'll miss out on the guests.

29
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,840
Can't you see?

30
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:01,280
Blood will be shed.

31
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,159
What?

32
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,159
He says there are no rooms left.

33
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:11,439
One room suffices.

34
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,039
We'll squeeze together.

35
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,800
It's pouring outside.

36
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,159
Those two took both rooms.

37
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:18,319
The inn's small.

38
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,479
We only have two rooms.

39
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,080
None left at all.

40
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:25,960
It's two rooms in total.

41
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,639
One for him and one for me.

42
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,039
No space left.

43
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,039
You're the Jin people?

44
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,639
You're the Jin people?

45
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:36,559
No.

46
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:38,800
Liao people?

47
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,800
Not exactly.

48
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:43,879
Your turn comes later.

49
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:44,919
Get out now.

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,840
What?

51
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,000
You want us out?

52
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,960
You want to get splattered with blood?

53
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,719
Splattered with blood.

54
00:03:18,004 --> 00:03:18,844
(Wine)

55
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,360
Never enough killers to slaughter.

56
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,439
Rooms should be available now.

57
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,584
(The Legend of Heroes)

58
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:43,552
=Duel on Mount Hua=

59
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:45,568

The Legend of the Condor Heroes)

00:05:45,568 --> 00:05:48,608
=Eastern Heretic and Western Venom=
=Episode 1=

61
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:55,599
Young Master,

62
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,679
it's morning.

63
00:05:58,759 --> 00:05:59,599
Has the rain stopped?

64
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,599
Yes.

65
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,799
Where's Lie?

66
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,120
Watching corpses downstairs.

67
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,319
I'll sleep longer.

68
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,279
The local authorities may come.

69
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,519
Let them come.

70
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:11,079
(Zhao Wei, Baituo Manor Attendant)
They're never our concern.

71
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,439
We're in unfamiliar land

72
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:13,799
with strange tongues.

73
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,800
I fear trouble.

74
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,120
I just got married.

75
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,879
Yet I'm here handling this mess.

76
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:20,240
Master, I'm sorry.

77
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,159
I'm so sorry.

78
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:22,799
Where are the bodies?

79
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,720
You said there were three.

80
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,959
Master, they were right here yesterday.

81
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,640
Arrest them!

82
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,120
(Lie Wei, Baituo Manor Attendant)
Get up!

83
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,960
Get up!

84
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,120
You want to rebel?

85
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,240
Where are you from?

86
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,279
Liao people.

87
00:06:47,892 --> 00:06:49,280
(Tea)

88
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,159
Stop.

89
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,640
We'll leave.

90
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,560
Kill and flee?

91
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,000
Are you defying my authority?

92
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,760
What did you say?

93
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,040
They didn't kill them.

94
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:10,920
Then who did?

95
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,360
They killed each other.

96
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,599
They're all dead.

97
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:14,839
Then why call me here?

98
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,519
One's local.

99
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:18,879
The other two

100
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:20,399
are from Lin'an's Zijin Hall.

101
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,639
Zijin Hall members got killed?

102
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,040
This local man

103
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,039
was surnamed Chai.

104
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,279
He was very fierce.

105
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:30,279
We're in trouble.

106
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,680
I don't understand

107
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,839
a single word of yours.

108
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,360
What did you say?

109
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,360
Why would Liao people come here?

110
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:40,719
Just passing through.

111
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:41,679
Heading to Lin'an.

112
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,519
Stop beating around the bush.

113
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:44,519
Arrest them!

114
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,919
Right. Arrest them.

115
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,200
Lie.

116
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:09,599
Forget it.

117
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm Ouyang Feng

118
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,640
from the Western Regions.

119
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,120
Have you been to Lin'an?

120
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,720
You must visit there once
in your lifetime.

121
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,919
It's a wonderful place.

122
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,720
I can't understand your tongue.

123
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:58,399
Is eastward travel equally confusing?

124
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,840
No.

125
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,240
Out of Ba Shu,

126
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:03,320
we don't understand
their language either.

127
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,799
Why did they fight?

128
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,480
Whenever northern expeditions

129
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,159
or peace negotiations are mentioned,

130
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,440
this chaos ensues.

131
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:13,720
Northern expeditions?

132
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,000
He was from the Chai family.

133
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,879
They were from Lin'an's Zijin Hall.

134
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,160
Chai and what hall?

135
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,080
The Chai family breeds brutes.

136
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,320
They fight like mad beasts.

137
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,679
Zijin Hall holds imperial influence.

138
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,919
The Dan family controls local officials.

139
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:46,399
Find

140
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,639
a kind local to travel with.

141
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:48,999
We'll pay.

142
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,480
My brother says
Southerners are cultured and fun.

143
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,399
It's a shame we can't understand them.

144
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:05,720
Those two from Zijin Hall

145
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,399
were killed by these three.

146
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,519
It has nothing to do with our county.

147
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:10,879
Understood?

148
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:11,960
- Understood.
- Understood.

149
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:13,720
Report it to Kuizhou.

150
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,360
Travel-stained robes
bear wine's lingering trace.

151
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,919
Wandering roads
etch sorrows line by line.

152
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,120
Am I a poet now in word and sign?

153
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:31,320
(Feng Youlan)
Or mule-rider through Sword Gate?

154
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,840
(Feng Heng)
Father,

155
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:36,239
you sneaked

156
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,200
the morning drink.

157
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,159
I failed miserably.

158
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,239
It's empty.

159
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,200
I regretted not drinking

160
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,320
another flask before departure.

161
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:45,599
Wait.

162
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,080
You ride the donkey.

163
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:51,999
I'll walk beside you.

164
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:54,080
At home, follow Father's word.

165
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,200
Married, obey your husband.

166
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,120
You're unwed yet,

167
00:10:58,559 --> 00:10:59,399
so follow my word.

168
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,359
You ride.

169
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,200
We both walk, okay?

170
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,120
The path's treacherous.

171
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:06,960
It struggles enough.

172
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,000
You're right.

173
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,080
Without it,

174
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,600
we'd never reach Bazhou.

175
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,920
Gentlemen,

176
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:23,999
good morning.

177
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:26,239
The path's narrow.

178
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,320
Please make way

179
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:29,440
to let this old man and the young girl

180
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,519
(Hu Baili, Salt Gang's Young Leader)
pass first.

181
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:35,279
Stop staring at the girl.

182
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:37,039
Mind your manners.

183
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,160
Father.

184
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,159
Feng Youlan,

185
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,240
you're going to Bazhou

186
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:50,639
for an official post?

187
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:53,879
The court appointed me
Bazhou's vice-prefect.

188
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:55,080
How'd you get promoted?

189
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,879
By helping my superior eliminate

190
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:58,879
two private salt trade bosses

191
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:00,720
in the Huainan region.

192
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,240
But those Huainan bosses

193
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,120
were my sworn uncles.

194
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,239
Salt Gang members?

195
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,200
Exactly.

196
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,200
Now you know

197
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:15,039
why I'm here.

198
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,279
You wouldn't dare kill

199
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,399
an imperial official.

200
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,200
So we chose

201
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,600
the Shu roads for this.

202
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,159
No witnesses here.

203
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,440
Wait.

204
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,000
Let me speak to my daughter.

205
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:33,119
Go ahead.

206
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,600
I never imagined

207
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
this day'd come so soon.

208
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,920
Heng,

209
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:49,840
you're twenty.

210
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,440
You just turned twenty.

211
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:56,120
I...

212
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,759
I regret so much.

213
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,960
For twenty years,

214
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,399
you've raised me.

215
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,399
Wherever you go,

216
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,919
as your daughter, I follow.

217
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:11,120
That's not what I meant.

218
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,919
Serving the court as an official

219
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,360
is your duty.

220
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,159
Eliminating criminals is right.

221
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:23,000
You should've expected

222
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,600
both promotion and martyrdom.

223
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:29,720
No.

224
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,919
I only regret not drinking

225
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,519
another flask of good wine this morning.

226
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:40,399
It's time.

227
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,919
Heng,

228
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:51,039
let me go distract them.

229
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,680
Don't hate us.

230
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:02,440
Karma demands a life for a life.

231
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:05,039
Join your father

232
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,159
in the underworld.

233
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,960
Go down.

234
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,120
Stab her twice,

235
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:53,440
alive or dead.

236
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:54,960
Yes, Young Leader.

237
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,839
She fell down herself.

238
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:39,039
She's definitely dead now.

239
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,559
Let's report to the Young Leader.

240
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:41,639
Okay.

241
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,200
She fell halfway down.

242
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:00,319
We saw her drop again.

243
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:01,639
Is she dead or not?

244
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,960
We couldn't go further.

245
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:04,399
She must be dead.

246
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,599
Dead or not, bring me her corpse.

247
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:08,319
Let's go.

248
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:09,960
Come up. Descend this way.

249
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,560
Let's go.

250
00:19:08,628 --> 00:19:11,648
(Huang Yaoshi)

251
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:26,159
Young Leader.

252
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,840
Baili.

253
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:29,240
She's definitely dead.

254
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,559
Mountains twist and turn.

255
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:33,319
Who knows

256
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,039
where she fell?

257
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:43,000
Salt Gang and the court

258
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
are natural enemies.

259
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,440
If she survives

260
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,759
and tells people

261
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:48,480
we killed Bazhou's vice-prefect today,

262
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:49,960
how can we do business later?

263
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,759
Apologies, gentlemen.

264
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:12,799
You heard

265
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:13,720
our talk.

266
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:14,879
We did.

267
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:16,159
It doesn't matter.

268
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,320
Dismount.

269
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:25,079
Where are you from?

270
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,240
We roam in all directions.

271
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,480
Perfect then.

272
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:30,119
So you know

273
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,040
eastern routes?

274
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,880
I need you as guides.

275
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,000
I don't need all of you.

276
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,080
One is enough.

277
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:40,439
You'll do.

278
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:42,960
Escort us east to Lin'an.

279
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:43,959
I'll pay.

280
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:44,960
Young master,

281
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,400
is he an idiot?

282
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:58,559
Another fight?

283
00:20:58,839 --> 00:20:59,960
We just exchanged words.

284
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,759
I imagined the South differently.

285
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,640
Attack!

286
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,480
Attack!

287
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,799
You know the Salt Gang?

288
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,839
You use poison?

289
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:06,880
You're Salt Gang's enemy now.

290
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:15,880
Common self-made poison

291
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,319
that subdues foes quickly.

292
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,160
It's fast-acting

293
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,000
and fades fast.

294
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:20,160
Send a pigeon.

295
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,000
Summon Seventeen.

296
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,080
Okay.

297
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,759
What's the Salt Gang?

298
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:25,679
Salt smugglers.

299
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,000
They deal with Jin,
Liao, Tubo, and Dali.

300
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,040
Extremely rich.

301
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,320
Young master,

302
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:35,720
southern lands are dangerous.

303
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,319
We should be cautious

304
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,400
with strangers.

305
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,960
How did this happen?

306
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:45,759
In the Jianyan era,

307
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:47,359
men of letters all migrated south.

308
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,480
All the people here

309
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:50,920
should be cultured and refined.

310
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,160
Let's head further east.

311
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,480
This is

312
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:00,480
the Ninefold Yin Pill.

313
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,840
It's a rare poison.

314
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:03,759
Only seven exist in the world.

315
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:06,039
Place two under your tongue.

316
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:07,639
In fifteen minutes,

317
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:08,959
it'll gather your qi,

318
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:10,679
mend your bones,

319
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:11,919
and regenerate flesh.

320
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,079
Yet you won't last long.

321
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:17,159
Open your mouth.

322
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:28,680
I need to reset your bones too.

323
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,079
After this,

324
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,240
I'll vanish before you.

325
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,720
We won't meet again.

326
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,800
Forgive my rudeness.

327
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,160
She's definitely dead.

328
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:43,440
Falling from there,

329
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,559
even if she survived,

330
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:45,640
all her bones

331
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,279
and internal organs would be crushed.

332
00:27:56,595 --> 00:27:59,021
(Kuizhou)

333
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,240
Young master, we've arrived.

334
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,400
Now this looks like the South!

335
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,720
Kuizhou's already this lively.

336
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:43,639
When we reach Lin'an,

337
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:46,200
we'll be in paradise on earth.

338
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:47,919
Young Master,

339
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,160
let's leave the city.

340
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:51,200
We have provisions with us.

341
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:54,039
I insist on dining here.

342
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,119
My friend.

343
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,759
Is that a place for food and drink?

344
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,240
There's also a stable.

345
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:03,279
You can eat your fill

346
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,279
and feed your horses.

347
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:06,759
Our establishment offers cheap meals
with free horse feed.

348
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,240
What does he mean?

349
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,680
- Probably inviting us to dine inside.
- Exactly.

350
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,160
Honored guests, right this way.

351
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,080
Okay.

352
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,240
Let's go.

353
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,760
Sir.

354
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,359
What did the three

355
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:46,599
Westerners order?

356
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:48,519
We...

357
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:50,040
Speak. We're Salt Gang members.

358
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:52,880
Their food was sent already.

359
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,880
Right, this is the wine they requested.

360
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,560
(Wine)
Uh...

361
00:30:36,928 --> 00:30:38,368
(Wine)
Upper guy! The wine is coming!

362
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,640
One jar of fine wine!

363
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,320
Friend.

364
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,359
You don't understand me?

365
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:08,199
I do.

366
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,640
I'm Ouyang Feng.

367
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:13,439
Huang Yaoshi.

368
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:15,959
Yaoshi.

369
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,080
Where are you from?

370
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,520
All corners

371
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:22,439
of the realm.

372
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:24,680
Have you been to Lin'an?

373
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,359
Yes,

374
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,320
six years ago.

375
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,119
This place offers everything.

376
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:30,880
Why only eat this?

377
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:34,079
I haven't eaten properly in ages.

378
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:36,960
I need to take it slow.

379
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:49,759
(Seventeen, Salt Gang Member)

380
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:51,359
Out of money, Yaoshi?

381
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:53,439
Yes.

382
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,800
On the way east,

383
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:56,279
the Southern customs

384
00:31:56,599 --> 00:31:57,480
and the local ways,

385
00:31:57,864 --> 00:31:58,944
are you familiar with them?

386
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,720
Sort of.

387
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:04,440
We're strangers.

388
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,319
Calling me Yaoshi

389
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:07,679
seems presumptuous.

390
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:09,920
We'll be familiar.

391
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:11,319
Join me to travel

392
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,519
to Lin'an together.

393
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,720
I'll pay you.

394
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,840
You'll pay me?

395
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:21,439
Why?

396
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:25,359
I like you.

397
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,240
We're kindred spirits.

398
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:46,119
Fall.

399
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,039
We can talk on the way.

400
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,759
I'm not a villain.

401
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,680
You can trust me.

402
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,599
We're total strangers.

403
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:38,399
Why would you?

404
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:41,079
Young Leader sent a pigeon message,

405
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,440
wanting you three dead.

406
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,240
Salt Gang?

407
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,480
Kuizhou Branch.

408
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,080
What's in the wine?

409
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:04,200
Deadly poison.

410
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,519
Again?

411
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:23,399
Give me the antidote.

412
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:25,639
Or all eight of you will die.

413
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:28,000
Our lives aren't our own.

414
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:41,559
What martial art did you use?

415
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:45,679
Mount Baituo's Instantaneous Leap.

416
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:48,079
It's okay you don't know.

417
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,679
Your life ends here.

418
00:36:31,136 --> 00:36:32,544
Kuizhou Garrison is here!

419
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:35,480
The garrison is here.

420
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:49,760
Kuizhou Garrison is here!

421
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,360
You northern murderers,

422
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,599
surrender now!

423
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,800
We three are merely passing by.

424
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:05,999
(Baiyun Tea)
We didn't commit murder.

425
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:07,719
You killed three in Ba County.

426
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,000
And you killed after fleeing here.

427
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,320
What did you say?

428
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:13,920
We're Kuizhou Garrison!

429
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:15,159
If you dare resist,

430
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,480
you have nowhere to hide

431
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:17,599
across imperial lands.

432
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,800
Does the South have justice?

433
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,639
Plead justice at Kuizhou Yamen.

434
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,599
Don't forget the gold.

435
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,440
I'll reason with them.

436
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,400
If you agree to travel together,

437
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,160
wait for me

438
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:40,400
on Kuizhou's east road

439
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,600
tomorrow morning.

440
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,280
Take them!

441
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,800
Support my buddies.

442
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,800
Kuizhou Yamen?

443
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,280
Lead the way.

444
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:35,959
Seventeenth.

445
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:37,039
Bribe the jailers.

446
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,679
Make them die tonight.

447
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,720
Okay.

448
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:40,999
Let's go.

449
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:41,920
Collect all items.

450
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:42,999
Yes!

451
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:54,479
I...

452
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:01,479
Master,

453
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:02,840
by your order, Yulong Garments'

454
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,920
premium blue outfit sets

455
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,760
are all ready here.

456
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:07,239
The 18-year-old Shaoxing Nu'er Hong wine

457
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,199
is slightly warmed.

458
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,199
Plus Lin'an's trendiest snacks

459
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,160
are also prepared.

460
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,200
You may leave.

461
00:39:14,759 --> 00:39:15,599
Master,

462
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:16,679
secure the table's gold.

463
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:17,960
We'll settle payment later.

464
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:24,639
Take the gold.

465
00:39:25,544 --> 00:39:26,464
Can't break such a sum.

466
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:28,559
The remainder

467
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,760
is yours.

468
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:35,719
Master, you're truly generous.

469
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:39,559
Catch this.

470
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,000
Can you talk?

471
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:53,960
If you can stand and run,

472
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:55,840
show me a few steps.

473
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,320
I won't kill you.

474
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,960
I'll send you to Jiangling

475
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:03,119
to meet my father. Okay?

476
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,239
Don't touch me.

477
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,480
Falling from a hundred-zhang cliff,

478
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:10,039
you survived and still could run?

479
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,639
What are your bones made of?

480
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,280
Did you consume some

481
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,320
elixir or magical herb?

482
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,000
Ants crawling on you

483
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,840
all died.

484
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,480
We Salt Gang love poisons.

485
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,280
My father is Hu Qianshou.

486
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:27,159
I'll present you to him

487
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:28,719
for thorough examination.

488
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,640
Sorry.

489
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,320
I don't want a fight.

490
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:43,039
You all

491
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:44,079
shouldn't fight either.

492
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,160
Agreed?

493
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:46,559
Who's this?

494
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,120
No introductions needed.

495
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:55,079
I came

496
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,840
to retrieve luggage.

497
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,199
Do you know where you are?

498
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,079
I don't care to know.

499
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,199
Young Leader,

500
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:07,559
he's with

501
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:08,519
the three Westerners.

502
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,599
Believe what you will.

503
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:13,439
Give me the luggage.

504
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:14,479
What luggage?

505
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,599
Earlier at the tavern,

506
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:18,880
he took something from the tavern.

507
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,559
A painting was inside.

508
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:22,880
It depicted a woman.

509
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,760
The three Westerners?

510
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:28,079
They're in the jail.

511
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,600
We planned

512
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,000
to finish them tonight.

513
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:32,480
But unexpectedly,

514
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,280
Zijin Hall's people arrived first.

515
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,800
What did Zijin Hall want?

516
00:42:36,128 --> 00:42:36,992
Among Zijin Hall's

517
00:42:36,992 --> 00:42:38,976
five crafts and eight trades
and Thirteen Taibao,

518
00:42:38,976 --> 00:42:41,056
the Jade and Comb Artisans
both died in Ba County.

519
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,039
Even a Chai family warrior,

520
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:43,959
Tie Sen, died.

521
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,200
Who killed them?

522
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,840
The magistrate claims
the three Westerners did it.

523
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,200
We didn't do it?

524
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:50,359
No.

525
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:51,399
Excuse me.

526
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:53,519
Where is

527
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:54,559
the luggage?

528
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,200
Kill him.

529
00:42:57,039 --> 00:42:58,559
Send his corpse to Zijin Hall.

530
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,039
Baili,

531
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:01,119
this man uses sorcery.

532
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:03,959
What?

533
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:05,199
Those two men earlier

534
00:43:05,279 --> 00:43:06,119
couldn't touch him

535
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:07,119
before being thrown back.

536
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:13,519
I don't want to kill.

537
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:14,999
The luggage

538
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:16,599
shouldn't concern you people.

539
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:19,079
Give it to me,

540
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,160
and I'll leave.

541
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,519
You won't kill?

542
00:43:36,199 --> 00:43:37,360
I will.

543
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:49,760
What's the point?

544
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:51,879
It's always this way.

545
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,640
Forget it.

546
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:09,119
I'll just leave.

547
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:50,840
My apologies.

548
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,960
He tried to kill me without reason.

549
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:55,480
I didn't want to kill.

550
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,199
- Young Leader!
- Young Leader!

551
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:13,519
Young Leader!

552
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,639
Send that woman

553
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:20,039
