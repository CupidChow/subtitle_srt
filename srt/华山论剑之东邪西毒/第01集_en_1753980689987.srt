00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,100
See you

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,020
Otherwise, bad luck will ray over you all.

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,180
You won't be?

12
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,260
Take a drink.

13
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,980
ROAST MARKET

14
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,860
I don't care whether you would happen!

15
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:56,540
You talk summary as long as anything is good.

16
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,260
You don't need to.

17
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,940
Look, the kindness you daughter did once for the fame,

18
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,100
now it won't not be the same!

19
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,100
I've been a monk for ten years

20
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,100
The world is poor

21
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,100
People like you are getting better and better

22
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,100
There is no world in Tian'an

23
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,100
What is the quality of the dog and the dog?

24
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,100
People like you are getting better and better

25
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,100
What did you say?

26
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,100
What kind of people are you?

27
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,100
Iron God

28
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,100
The dog is out

29
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,100
The dog is out

30
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,100
The dog is out

31
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,100
I can't see it

32
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,100
It's going to bite

33
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,120
Eating

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,040
She said that she ran out of rooms

35
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,080
A room is enough

36
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:23,920
Just three of us

37
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,380
It's only two rooms

38
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,000
Two of us

39
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,300
That's all

40
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,140
You are will jouer

41
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,140
You are Jin people?

42
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,140
No

43
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,140
You are Liao people?

44
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,140
No

45
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:45,140
I will wait for you to come out

46
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,140
What?

47
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,140
Let us go out?

48
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,140
Are you afraid of the blood sword?

49
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,140
Blood sword is the best

50
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,140
I can't kill you, you are so stupid

51
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,140
There should be a room now

52
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,140
The blood sword is the best

53
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,140
I can't kill you, you are so stupid

54
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,140
There should be a room now

55
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,140
Blood sword is the best

56
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,140
I can't kill you, you are so stupid

57
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,140
There should be a room now

58
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,140
Blood sword is the best

59
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,140
I can't kill you, you are so stupid

60
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,140
There should be a room now

61
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,140
Blood sword is the best

62
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,140
I can't kill you, you are so stupid

63
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,140
There should be a room now

64
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,140
Blood sword is the best

65
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,140
I can't kill you, you are so stupid

66
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,140
There should be a room now

67
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,140
politics

68
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,140
young master

69
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,140
its dawn

70
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,140
I'm afraid that the South State will come

71
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,060
So what?

72
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,660
It has nothing to do with us

73
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,140
We are not familiar with the place, Young Master

74
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,460
We can't understand what you are saying

75
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,660
I'm afraid that we can't explain it clearly

76
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,140
I'm sorry, Master

77
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,660
I'm sorry

78
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,260
Siting, don't you want to say something?

79
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,260
Master, was it here yesterday?

80
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,260
Yes

81
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,260
I'm sorry

82
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,260
I'm sorry

83
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,260
I'm sorry

84
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,260
I'm sorry

85
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,260
I'm sorry

86
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,260
I'm sorry

87
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,260
I'm sorry

88
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,260
Are you still here?

89
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,260
Here

90
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,260
Get up

91
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,260
Get up

92
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,260
Get up

93
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,260
You just came back from the war

94
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,260
Where are you from?

95
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,260
Liaozen

96
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,260
Don't fight

97
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,260
Let's go

98
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,260
You want to leave after killing someone?

99
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,260
Don't you want to put me in your eyes?

100
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,260
What did you say?

101
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,260
They didn't kill him

102
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,260
Who killed him?

103
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,260
The people who killed Fu

104
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,260
They all died

105
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,260
Then why did you call me?

106
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,260
One is from the county

107
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,260
The other two are from the capital of Lin'an

108
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,260
The people from the capital were killed?

109
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,260
The people from the county are like the name of the village

110
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,260
They are very fierce

111
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,260
They are fierce

112
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,260
I'm so confused

113
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,260
I can't understand a word of you

114
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,260
What are you talking about?

115
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,260
Why did you come here?

116
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,260
I just passed by Lin'an

117
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,260
You know it

118
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,260
Get up

119
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,260
Get up

120
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,260
Brother Lie

121
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,260
Forget it

122
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,260
My name is Ouyang Feng

123
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,260
I'm from Lin'an

124
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,260
Have you been to Lin'an?

125
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,260
You must go there in your lifetime

126
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,260
It's a good place

127
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,260
I don't understand a word of you

128
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,260
Is it the same when we go east?

129
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,260
No

130
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,260
Except for the Basu

131
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,260
We can't understand a word of you

132
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,260
Why did they fight?

133
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,260
As long as it's about the North France

134
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,260
It will be like this

135
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,260
North France?

136
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,260
This is from the Cai family

137
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,260
That is Lin'an

138
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,260
That is the city of Lin'an

139
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,260
The city of Lin'an

140
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,260
This is from the Cai family

141
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,260
That is the city of Lin'an

142
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,260
What city?

143
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,260
There are many outsiders in the Cai family

144
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,260
They are fierce

145
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,260
The city of Lin'an is a big city

146
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,260
The government officials are all from their families

147
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,260
Find a local from Heshan on the way

148
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,260
We will pay

149
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,260
Brother said the South Korean people are interesting

150
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,260
It's a pity that you can't understand a word of them

151
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,260
The two people in the capital

152
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,260
were killed by those three

153
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,260
They have nothing to do with the enemy

154
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,260
Do you understand?

155
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,260
Yes

156
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,260
I can pay

157
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:19,260
The courtiers beat the wine

158
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,260
They are everywhere

159
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,260
They are everywhere

160
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,260
What is this body?

161
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,260
The body of a poet

162
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:31,260
The body of a poet

163
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,260
Father

164
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,260
You stole wine this morning

165
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,260
I didn't steal the wine

166
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,260
I was so drunk

167
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:43,260
I regret that I didn't drink a good bottle of wine

168
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,260
Stop

169
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,260
You ride the donkey, I will walk down

170
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,260
You are a woman

171
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,260
You are a woman

172
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,260
You are not married yet

173
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,260
Listen to me, you ride the donkey

174
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,260
Both of you should go

175
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,260
The mountain road is so steep

176
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,260
It's hard to ride the donkey

177
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,260
You are right

178
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,260
Without her, we can't get to the eight states

179
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,260
Your father is right

180
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,260
Your father is right

181
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,260
Your father is right

182
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,260
You are right

183
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,260
Be good

184
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,260
The road is narrow

185
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,260
Move aside

186
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,260
Let the old man and the girl go first

187
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,260
Don't look at the girls

188
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,260
It's etiquette

189
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,260
Feng You Lan?

190
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,260
Go to Ba Zhou to be an official.

191
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,260
The court ordered me to be Ba Zhou's official.

192
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,260
How did you become an official?

193
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,260
I killed Huainan's second-in-command of the East and West

194
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,260
and sold the head of the private salt.

195
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,260
But Huainan's second-in-command

196
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,260
is my will.

197
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,260
The people of the salt gang?

198
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,260
Yes.

199
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:15,260
Now you know what I'm here for.

200
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,260
I know you wouldn't kill the court official.

201
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,260
That's why we chose to do it on the way.

202
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,260
No one saw us.

203
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,260
Stop.

204
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,260
I have something to say to my daughter.

205
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,260
Go ahead.

206
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,260
I didn't expect this day would come so soon.

207
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:52,260
Heng, you are only 20 years old.

208
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,260
I...

209
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,260
I regret it.

210
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,260
20 years.

211
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,260
It's you who educated me.

212
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,260
Wherever you went,

213
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,260
I followed you.

214
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,260
Where did you go?

215
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,260
I didn't mean that.

216
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:18,260
It's natural for an official to serve the court.

217
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,260
Jin Si should.

218
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,260
The promotion and the decree should be in your mind.

219
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,260
It's not that.

220
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:37,260
I regret not drinking a good wine this morning.

221
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,260
It's time to go.

222
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,260
Heng.

223
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,260
I'll go and see them.

224
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,260
Heng.

225
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,260
Heng.

226
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,260
I will make a wish on shaolin.

227
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,260

228
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,480

231
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,780

Pursue them someone, whom will we marry attractor help them?

234
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:37,700
Twelve years ago,antique,

235
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,900
He's gonna lose there.

236
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,600
Let's go to the5th strokes of the royal Richard.

237
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,600
Okay.

238
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,160
The fire has been set on the mountain.

239
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,520
We can't see him fall down.

240
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,520
Is he dead?

241
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,240
He's really blind.

242
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,520
He must be dead.

243
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,640
I want to see him dead.

244
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,160
Let's go.

We can't see him fall down.

250
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,600
Is he dead?

251
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,600
I want to see him dead.

252
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600

00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,200
Let's go down this way.

281
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,300
Let's go down this way.

282
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:22,800
Lbury

283
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,600
Lbury

284
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:23,920
Let's go down this way.

285
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,600
Let's go down this way.

286
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:24,900

Killing

289
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,900

Set out

292
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Killing

293
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,440
Don't forget

294
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,440
Don't forget

295
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,440
The Yan Gang and the court are already enemies

296
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,440
If they are alive

297
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,440
and speak out

298
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,440
we will kill all the rebels in Bazhou

299
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,440
What will the Yan Gang do in the future?

300
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,440
I'm sorry, Sanwei

301
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,440
I let you hear what I said just now

302
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,440
I heard it

303
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,440
It's okay

304
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,440
Get off the horse

305
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,440
Where are you from?

306
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,440
East, west, south, north, everywhere

307
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,440
That's the best

308
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,440
You know all the ways to the east

309
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,440
I want to invite you to sit on the elephant

310
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,440
No need to get together

311
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,440
One is enough

312
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,440
You are the best

313
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,440
Go to Lin'an Prefecture along the way

314
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,440
I will pay

315
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,440
Master, Lei Pa is not a kid

316
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,440
Don't fight again

317
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,440
Just said a few words

318
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,440
The people of the South Dynasty should not be like this

319
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,440
Kill

320
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,440
Kill

321
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,440
Kill

322
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,440
Do you know the Yan Gang?

323
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,440
Kill

324
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,440
Kill

325
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,440
You know how to use poison

326
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,440
Poison

327
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,440
The Yan Gang is taking revenge on you

328
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,440
It's a common self-training poison

329
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,440
It can hold the opponent in a short time

330
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,440
It's fast to spread and to be poisoned

331
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,440
Brother Fei, send the messenger to call the envoy

332
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,440
Okay

333
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,440
What does the Yan Gang do?

334
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,440
Fan Siyan

335
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,440
He has contact with Jinliao, Tupo, Dali

336
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,440
He can be sent to the Empire

337
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,440
The Empire

338
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,440
Master

339
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,440
The South Dynasty is dangerous

340
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,440
We should be careful when we meet people

341
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,440
How could it be?

342
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,440
When people meet people, they all come to the South Dynasty

343
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,440
People here should be all kind and gentle

344
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,440
Just go east

345
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,440
Go east

346
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,440
apprentices

347
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,440
Pour the Yangling wine

348
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,540
What can I do for you, Sir?

349
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,000
Illustrate it for me.

350
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,100
We will use it approximately on the last date of this trip.

351
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,840
What did you think about it?

352
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,540
I saw it and so I understood.

353
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,640
You can't托只,

354
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,480
I want to see it

355
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,780
station by station.

356
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,880
Lighting.

357
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,880
This is the Nine-Change Silver Wheel Pill.

358
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,480
It's very poisonous.

359
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,680
There are seven, two, and five in total.

360
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,680
After one, it will be dead.

361
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,080
It will die.

362
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,080
But it won't last long.

363
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,280
Open your mouth.

364
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,880
I will help you to remove the poison.

365
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,880
Open your mouth.

366
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,880
I will help you to remove the poison.

367
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,880
Now.

368
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,880
Open your mouth.

369
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,880
It's definitely dead.

370
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,880
If it falls down this high,

371
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,880
even if it's fine,

372
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:55,020
the bones and five-fingered

373
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,020
are still there.

374
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,020
It's still there.

375
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,020
It's still there.

376
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,020
Young Master, we've arrived.

377
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,020
Come on.

378
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,020
Come on.

379
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,020
Come on.

380
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,020
Come on.

381
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,020
Come on.

382
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,020
Come on.

383
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,020
Come on.

384
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:28,020
Come on.

385
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,020
Come on.

386
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:39,020
This is what the Southern Dynasty looks like.

387
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,020
Huizhou City is so lively.

388
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,020
That year,

389
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,020
it was heaven.

390
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,020
Young Master,

391
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,020
let's go out.

392
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,020
There are people in the luggage.

393
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,020
They want to eat here.

394
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,020
Huizhou.

395
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,020
Is that a place to eat and drink?

396
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,020
There are also mafangs behind.

397
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,020
We are the fire team.

398
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,020
Ma Yan is the fire team.

399
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,020
We are the cheap team.

400
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,020
The fire is very rich.

401
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,020
What do you mean?

402
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,020
Maybe they want us to go in.

403
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,020
Wait.

404
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,020
Sir, please come in.

405
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,020
Okay.

406
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:20,020
Thank you.

407
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,020
Thank you.

408
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,020
Sir.

409
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,020
What did the three Westerners order?

410
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,020
That...

411
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,020
Say it.

412
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,020
The salt gang.

413
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,020
The soup is out.

414
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,020
Yes.

415
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,020
That is the wine they ordered.

416
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:02,020
This...

417
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,020
The wine is here.

418
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,020
It's here.

419
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,020
Wait a minute.

420
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,020
Wait.

421
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,020
The wine is here.

422
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,020
Good wine

423
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,220
My friend

424
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,620
You can't understand me?

425
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,220
I can

426
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,820
My name is Ouyang Feng

427
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,620
The pharmacist

428
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:15,820
Brother Yao

429
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,020
Where are you from?

430
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:22,020
I'm from everywhere

431
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,420
Have you been to Lin'an?

432
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,820
Yes, six years ago

433
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,820
There are many restaurants here

434
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,620
Why do you only eat these?

435
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,620
I haven't eaten for a long time

436
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,820
I have to eat slowly

437
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,620
Brother Yao has no money?

438
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,620
Yes

439
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,220
You are from everywhere

440
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,820
The south is clean and the city is peaceful

441
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,020
You can talk

442
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,220
Do you want to talk?

443
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,020
Yes

444
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,020
We are not familiar with each other

445
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,620
We call each other brother

446
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:06,820
It's not appropriate

447
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,420
We will get to know each other soon

448
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,620
We will go to Lin'an

449
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:11,820
We will go together

450
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,020
I will pay you

451
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,020
Pay?

452
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,220
Why?

453
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,620
I like you

454
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,420
We are meant to be together

455
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,020
Hit me

456
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,020
Hit me

457
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,220
I will talk on the way

458
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:59,020
I am definitely not a bad person

459
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,820
Brother Yao, don't worry

460
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,120
Brother Yao

461
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:24,820
Brother Yao

462
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,220
Best of friends

463
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,320
why?

464
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,420
AlЧ…

465
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,920
The young general's rumor

466
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,320
You are all dead

467
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,220
The Liberal Prince?

468
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:50,280
?]

469
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,460
What's inside the wine?

470
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,580
Poison of my life.

471
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:25,460
Final Battle

472
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,540
Again!

473
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,320
No, right?

474
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,520
Come on, Zifang.

475
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,120
Kill身 introductory drill.

476
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,220
殺害殺殺

477
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,700
Just a moment.

478
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:46,520
Deng chart is Bomber nerve testing.

479
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,920
It's okay if you didn't hear it.

480
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,320
Your life is gone anyway.

481
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:16,960
Yes

482
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,200
All of you come back.

483
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,760
The reinforcements are coming.

484
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,320
You!

485
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,920
The man in the white dress!

486
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,440
The man in the white dress!

487
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,800
Hurry up and surrender!

488
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,800
We three just passed by.

489
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,200
No one in the white dress.

490
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,840
Three people were killed in Ba County.

491
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,800
And he came here.

492
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,280
He's the man in the white dress!

493
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,320
What did you say?

494
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,200
The man in the white dress!

495
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,400
He dared to take off his clothes.

496
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,640
The country is in the south.

497
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,760
It's not hard to find him.

498
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,920
Is there a place to give a speech?

499
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,720
You can go to the Fuya to give a speech.

500
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,800
Don't forget the gold on the table.

501
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,560
I'll give a speech.

502
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,480
If you agree to go on a trip,

503
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,280
tomorrow morning,

504
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,560
we'll go to the east of Huizhou.

505
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,320
Wait.

506
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,240
Take him down!

507
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,600
Take care of my two brothers.

508
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,520
You're going to the Fuya, right?

509
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,840
Take the road ahead.

510
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,640
Lord Ye!

511
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:34,400
Lord Ye!

512
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:34,960
Lord Pei!

513
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:41,460
Lord Pei!

514
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,040
Morning!

515
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,560
Good morning.

516
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,120
You're awake.

517
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,400
I…

518
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,400
I…

519
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,980
Father, your grandson's

520
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:59,400
jade dragon shirt, upper-class qingshan

521
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,400
and clothes are all here.

522
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,400
The 18-year-old girl,

523
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,400
who is popular with young girls,

524
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,400
is very popular with young girls.

525
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,400
And the most considerate girl,

526
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,400
Lin Yan, is also here.

527
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,400
Go.

528
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,400
Father,

529
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,400
I…

530
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,400
I…

531
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,400
I…

532
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,400
I…

533
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,400
Father,

534
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,400
please keep the gold on the table.

535
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,400
I'll come out later to take it.

536
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,400
You take the gold.

537
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,400
I'm sorry.

538
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,400
The rest

539
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,400
is all yours.

540
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,400
Father,

541
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,400
father is a good man.

542
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,400
Go.

543
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,400
Go.

544
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,400
Can you talk?

545
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,400
If you can stand up and run,

546
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,400
run a few more steps and show me.

547
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,400
I won't kill you.

548
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,400
I'll send you to Jiangling

549
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,400
to see my father, okay?

550
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,400
Don't touch me.

551
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,400
You fell down from the cliff

552
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,400
and you can still run.

553
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,400
What did you do with your bones?

554
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,400
Did you eat something

555
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,400
that you can't eat?

556
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,400
I ate the herbs from the fairy lamp.

557
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,400
I saw ants on you

558
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,400
and they were dead.

559
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,400
Our Yan Gang likes to poison.

560
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,400
My father is called the protector.

561
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,400
I'll give you to him.

562
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,400
Let him give you a good massage.

563
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,400
I'm sorry.

564
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,400
I don't want to fight.

565
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,400
You don't have to do it either.

566
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,400
Okay?

567
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,400
Who are you?

568
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,400
No need to know.

569
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,400
I'm here

570
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,400
to get the luggage.

571
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,400
Do you know where this is?

572
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,400
I don't want to know.

573
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,400
Young Master,

574
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,400
he and the other three people

575
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,400
are a team.

576
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,400
Whatever you say,

577
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,400
give me the luggage.

578
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,400
What luggage?

579
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,400
When Bai Tian was in the restaurant,

580
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,400
he took it away.

581
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,400
There was a painting

582
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,400
and a woman in it.

583
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,400
Where are the three Westerners?

584
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,400
They went to jail.

585
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,400
They were going to kill them tonight.

586
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,400
But they didn't expect

587
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,400
the people of the Forbidden City to arrive first.

588
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,400
What are the people of the Forbidden City doing here?

589
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,400
The imperial and imperial courtiers

590
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,400
of the Eighth Route Army of the Forbidden City

591
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,400
of the Forbidden City

592
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,400
are all dead in the Eighth Route County.

593
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,400
A master of the Chai family is also dead.

594
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,400
The master of the Chai family,

595
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,400
Tie Sen.

596
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,400
Who found it?

597
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,400
The county council said

598
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,400
three Westerners killed him.

599
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,400
It has nothing to do with us.

600
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,400
It has nothing to do with us.

601
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,400
I'm sorry.

602
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,400
Where is the luggage?

603
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,400
Kill him.

604
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,400
The body is sent to the Forbidden City.

605
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,400
Brother Bai Lie,

606
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,400
this person knows magic.

607
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,400
What?

608
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,400
The two people just now

609
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,400
flew in before they touched his body.

610
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,400
I don't want to kill.

611
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,400
The luggage has nothing to do with you.

612
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,400
Give it to me.

613
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,400
I'm leaving.

614
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,400
If you don't kill,

615
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,400
I'll kill.

616
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,400
Why?

617
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,400
Always like this.

618
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,400
Forget it.

619
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,400
I'm leaving.

620
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,400
Go.

621
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,400
Go.

622
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,400
Go.

623
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,400
I'm sorry.

624
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,400
He is innocent.

625
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,400
He had to kill me.

626
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,400
I don't want to kill.

627
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,400
Young Master.

628
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,400
Young Master.

629
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,400
Young Master.

630
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,400
Young Master.

631
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,400
Young Master.

632
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,400
Young Master.

633
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,400
Young Master.

634
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,400
Young Master.

635
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,400
Young Master.

636
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,400
Young Master.

637
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,400
That woman...

638
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,400
I want to get rid of her.

639
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,400
I've been born to be a bad person.

640
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:49,400
Who will forget me?

641
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,400
I drink and drink alone.

642
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,400
The empty window is filled with flowers.

643
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,400
The sword is burning.

644
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,400
The world is like a sunset.

645
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,400
The clouds are like wind, but the moon is like a bubble.

646
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:09,400
Where can I live in this life?

647
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,400
Where can I live?

648
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,400
I have no idea.

649
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,400
I'm not willing to be a fool.

650
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:25,400
I'm a fool.

651
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:30,400
I've never been angry.

652
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,400
I won't let you.

653
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,400
I'm a fool.

654
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,400
I don't know when I'll be free.

655
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,400
I can't help it.

656
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:52,400
I can't help it.

657
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,400
Don't come.

658
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,400
Get out.

659
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:06,400
I don't know when I'm going to be free.

660
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:12,400
You don't know anything.

661
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:17,400
They were both young.

662
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:20,400
I don't know.
