00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
аго

2
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,680
remedy

3
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,680
Colombia

4
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,460
Sha Stop

5
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,760
Sha Stop

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,760
He is a man of the martial arts world.

7
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,760
He is actually a king.

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,760
He is good friends with the court.

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,760
He is a man of the martial arts world.

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,760
I heard that he is going to give up martial arts.

11
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,760
He is going to play chess and painting.

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,760
His martial arts are very good.

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,760
He is a man of the world.

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,760
He is immersed in peace and is very mischievous.

15
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,760
Officer Cai, my porridge should be here.

16
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,760
If I keep talking, the porridge will get cold.

17
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,760
It's rude to bring it in and eat it.

18
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,760
You are holding hands with me.

19
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,760
Are you afraid of being rude?

20
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,760
I came to visit the bedroom.

21
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,760
I can't even see you.

22
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,760
I am disabled.

23
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,760
I am blocking the screen.

24
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,760
First, for the sake of the party.

25
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,760
Second, people with disabilities are ashamed to see people.

26
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,760
Officer Cai is the leader of the royal family.

27
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,760
Don't be like me.

28
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,760
Then just say it.

29
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,760
My family and the dead gold hall are in a fight.

30
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,760
Which side do you stand on?

31
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

32
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

33
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

34
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

35
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

36
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

37
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

38
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

39
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

40
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

41
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

42
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

43
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

44
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

45
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

46
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

47
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

48
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

49
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

50
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

51
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

52
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

53
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

54
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

55
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

56
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

57
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

58
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

59
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

60
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

61
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

62
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

63
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

64
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

65
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

66
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

67
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

68
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

69
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

70
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

71
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

72
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,760
I am the leader of the royal family.

73
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,760
The Long Ballad

74
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,760
Episode 16

75
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,760
Officer Cai,

76
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,760
I am not a martial arts master.

77
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,760
I don't know martial arts.

78
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,760
It's useless to stand on any side.

79
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,760
The Yan Gang is a rich country.

80
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,760
Don't say that.

81
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,760
You are going to kill me.

82
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,760
You are going to kill me.

83
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,760
Then why do you earn so much money?

84
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,760
The Yan Gang

85
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,760
is a lawless country.

86
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,760
The business is illegal.

87
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,760
There are many enemies.

88
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,760
The court is also an enemy.

89
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,760
The court is an enemy.

90
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,760
The court is an enemy.

91
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,760
What's wrong with us?

92
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,760
What's wrong with us?

93
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,760
It's different.

94
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,760
You treat the court as an enemy.

95
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,760
The court treats me as an enemy.

96
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,760
The Yan Gang

97
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,760
is going to find a way

98
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,760
in the gap.

99
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,760
Please

100
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,760
forgive me.

101
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,760
I will say a few things.

102
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,760
Chief Hu, please think about it.

103
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,760
Last October,

104
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,760
the Taifu Temple

105
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,760
was destroyed.

106
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,760
Seven people died in one night.

107
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,760
They were all poisoned.

108
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,760
In July of the previous year,

109
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,760
the Ming Zhou was betrayed and killed.

110
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,760
The officials

111
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,760
were shocked

112
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,760
by the news.

113
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,760
Five days ago,

114
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,760
the new leader of the Ba Zhou,

115
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,760
Feng Youlan,

116
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,760
was not killed.

117
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,760
He must have died.

118
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,760
Chief Hu,

119
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,760
if you don't help,

120
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,760
the enmity between the Chai family

121
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,760
and the Yan Gang will be over.

122
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,760
Chief Chai.

123
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,760
Chief Chai.

124
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,760
Chief Chai,

125
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,760
Chief Hu asked you to come.

126
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,760
Please close the door.

127
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,760
Don't hide.

128
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,760
Face to face, say it.

129
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,760
Chief Chai, say it.

130
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,760
The Chai family and the Zijing Hall

131
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,760
all have your people,

132
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,760
right?

133
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,760
Before the Zheng came,

134
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,760
some of the money

135
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,760
was spent in the court.

136
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,760
The other part

137
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,760
was spent

138
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,760
on the Chai family

139
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,760
and the Zijing Hall.

140
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,760
Otherwise,

141
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,760
how could the Yan Gang

142
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,760
survive

143
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,760
between the court and the Jianghu?

144
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,760
Qi Qing,

145
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,760
Tie Ling,

146
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,760
Tie Mu,

147
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,760
who is your man in the court?

148
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,760
Come and see me.

149
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,760
The six masters of the Chai family

150
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,760
are called three.

151
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,760
All three are.

152
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,760
How can the six masters

153
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,760
be bought with money?

154
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,760
Chief Chai,

155
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,760
you are too suspicious.

156
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,760
I have made it clear.

157
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,760
I will not leave

158
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,760
for nothing.

159
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,760
Chief Chai,

160
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:47,760
the soul-suppressing

161
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,760
Qi Gong is already

162
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,760
the seventh one.

163
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,760
How about this?

164
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,760
The Chai family

165
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,760
is fighting with the Zijing Hall.

166
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,760
I stand

167
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,760
It's not good for them

168
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,560
They just want to make some money

169
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,160
Well

170
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,760
My people

171
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,360
will listen to you

172
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,960
Okay?

173
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,960
On the eighth day, I will meet with Dantian

174
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,960
Before the eighth day

175
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,760
half of the people of Wuhang Bazaar will die

176
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,560
You are too high-minded

177
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,760
Two of them died in Baxian

178
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,560
Now five are in Jiangling

179
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,160
You are not high-minded

180
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,360
Why do I come here and visit you personally?

181
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,360
Then today

182
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,960
I will kill one more person

183
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,160
to reassure you

184
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,760
I will stand by your side

185
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,760
It's a deal

186
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,160
You should leave

187
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,160
Hu Jianshou is disabled

188
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,360
I can't see him off

189
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,360
Goodbye

190
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,160
I went to Lin'an to see Dantian

191
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,160
I heard that Chayu came here

192
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,360
Chayu came here

193
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,360
Chayu wants to fight against Zijintang

194
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,360
I will stand by Zijintang's side

195
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,160
Chief, have you decided

196
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,160
to fight against both sides?

197
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,360
Not directly

198
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,160
I trained the masters of both families

199
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,160
and waited for this time

200
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,960
After the eighth day

201
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,760
there will be no Chayu and Zijintang

202
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,760
Only Yan Gang and Zijintang

203
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,760
I see

204
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,960
It's cold

205
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,560
It's from Kuizhou

206
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,560
I will ask Yanshi

207
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,360
What should she do?

208
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,460
What should she do?

209
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,040
escort Xie Huizhen into the military

210
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,160
We deal with two tactical encounters

211
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,960
We'll all kill you

212
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,760
As long as they deal with girls

213
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,560
the sizes of your body are enough

214
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,360
I'm still worried about you

215
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,460
I mean the fire

216
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:56,460
Chief, your son, Hu Baili, is dead.

217
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,460
What else did you say?

218
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,460
The 17th is about to arrive.

219
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,460
Take Young Master to the city.

220
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:13,460
Next time you leave, you will die.

221
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,460
Okay.

222
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,460
Let's go.

223
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:55,460
What are you looking at?

224
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,460
Nothing.

225
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,460
I've never seen you like this.

226
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,460
I've never seen you like this.

227
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,460
You dressed so well, but you didn't let anyone see you.

228
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,460
Why?

229
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,460
I don't know if you can see me.

230
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,460
Be careful.

231
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,460
I'm sorry.

232
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,460
You're so...

233
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,460
Brother.

234
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:33,460
It's our young lady. I didn't see it wrong.

235
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,460
Young lady, two people are in Cuihua House.

236
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,460
One more student is with them.

237
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,460
I've never seen him in Kuizhou.

238
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,460
Did Elder Wu Ha call you?

239
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,460
The deputy chief of the official business is in Pengzi.

240
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,460
He should be here.

241
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,460
It's the same. Don't follow me.

242
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,460
Young lady, there are only two people left in the West Wing.

243
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,460
Even if Ouyang Feng's martial arts are good,

244
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,460
if we go together, we can do it.

245
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,460
Why do you...

246
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,460
Why what?

247
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,460
Why do you invite Elder Wu Ha?

248
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,460
It's complicated.

249
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,460
It's complicated. You can talk about it.

250
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,460
Let's go.

251
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:31,460
Am I not good in this?

252
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,460
You're good in everything.

253
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,460
Young lady, I think

254
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,460
it's better for us to stay by your side.

255
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,460
After all, the rest of the people died in my hands.

256
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,460
If the chief of the unit is blamed,

257
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,460
I can't afford to take the responsibility.

258
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,460
Young lady, how complicated is it?

259
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,460
To put it simply,

260
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,460
I just want to play with Ouyang Feng.

261
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,460
Good.

262
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,460
Good.

263
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,460
Come on.

264
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,460
Come on.

265
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,460
Beat him.

266
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,460
Beat him.

267
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,460
Come on.

268
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,460
Hold the chopsticks.

269
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,460
Good.

270
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,460
Come on.

271
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:49,460
This is too much fun.

272
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,460
Good.

273
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,460
What do you want to play?

274
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,460
Brother Ouyang,

275
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,460
why don't we find a quiet place

276
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,460
to rest?

277
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,460
Come on.

278
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,460
Look around.

279
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,460
There is only such a place in the South.

280
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,460
Go.

281
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,460
Brother Yao.

282
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,460
Go.

283
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,460
There is a woman

284
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,460
in the car.

285
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,460
Young Master,

286
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,460
the body of the immortal brought back from Mount Ba,

287
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,460
before he died,

288
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,460
he gave him a letter of filial piety.

289
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,460
Open it.

290
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,460
Open it.

291
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,460
My son died in Kuizhou.

292
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,460
Why are you back?

293
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,460
Master,

294
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,460
let you know the reason.

295
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,460
We'll leave after we finish talking.

296
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,460
Say it.

297
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,460
Young Master,

298
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,460
under the order of the master,

299
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,460
went to Mount Ba

300
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,460
to kill the new Ba Zhou

301
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,460
leader, Feng Youlan.

302
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,460
Feng Youlan was killed.

303
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,460
His daughter jumped off the cliff.

304
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,460
Young Master looked at the bottom of the cliff.

305
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,460
Unexpectedly,

306
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,460
Feng Youlan was killed.

307
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,460
Feng Youlan was killed.

308
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,460
He looked at the bottom of the cliff.

309
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,460
Unexpectedly,

310
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,460
Feng Youlan was killed.

311
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,460
He was covered in blood.

312
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,460
He was so close to the East.

313
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,460
He jumped up and ran away.

314
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,460
Go on.

315
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,460
Young Master was filial.

316
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,460
He knew the body of the master,

317
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,460
so he brought this woman back to Mount Ba.

318
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,460
He wanted to send a general to help the master.

319
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,460
I followed Young Master's

320
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,460
imperial edict

321
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,460
to kill the three Westerners.

322
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,460
The people were killed.

323
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,460
The people of the government were arrested.

324
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,460
I took the luggage of the three people

325
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,460
back to Fenduo.

326
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,460
It was dark.

327
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,460
A demon came back to take the luggage.

328
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,460
I killed Young Master.

329
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,460
Demon?

330
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,460
Master,

331
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,460
I've never seen a person's

332
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,460
martial arts skills

333
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,460
so high.

334
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,460
I've never heard of it.

335
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,460
A person's martial arts skills

336
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,460
can't be so high.

337
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,460
Was he with the Westerners?

338
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,460
Yes.

339
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,460
He met him at the first station.

340
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,460
The three Westerners' leader is Ouyang Feng.

341
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,460
His martial arts skills are also very high.

342
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,460
Do you have anything else to say?

343
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,460
Master,

344
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,460
I have two more words.

345
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,460
That demon

346
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,460
must have a private relationship with this woman.

347
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,460
When he was at the first station,

348
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,460
the demon took the pill for him.

349
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,460
This woman can't die.

350
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,460
She must have something to do with the demon.

351
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,460
Si Qi Guang!

352
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,460
Si Qi Guang!

353
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,460
Master!

354
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,460
Master!

355
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,460
Master is our brother

356
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,460
who is fighting with Kuizhou.

357
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,460
It's me!

358
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,460
I told him to keep an eye on

359
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,460
the whereabouts of the demon and Ouyang Feng.

360
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,460
Master!

361
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,460
Call him in.

362
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,460
Si Qi Guang!

363
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,460
Master!

364
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,460
Speak.

365
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,460
A foreign man came

366
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,460
and he went to see the Westerners.

367
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,460
He was at the first station.

368
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,460
He's dead.

369
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,460
He's dead.

370
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,460
He's dead.

371
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,460
He's at Cuihua Pavilion.

372
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,460
Go to Cuihua Pavilion

373
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,460
and tell that demon

374
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,460
to come here.

375
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,460
Chief Lei?

376
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,460
Didn't you say

377
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,460
that woman and I have a private relationship?

378
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,460
Don't disturb the business.

379
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,460
Just tell him to come alone.

380
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,460
I know.

381
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,460
The drum is played by the hands.

382
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,460
It's played slowly.

383
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,460
It's the fun of playing the drum.

384
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,460
Yes.

385
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,460
It's boring if you turn it around.

386
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,460
Yes.

387
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,460
Really?

388
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,460
No way.

389
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,460
Am I the winner?

390
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,460
The little friend is a pair of red heads.

391
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,460
The third one is the last one.

392
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,460
But it doesn't matter.

393
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:15,460
Do you want to add ten coins?

394
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,460
Yes.

395
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,460
Add some.

396
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,460
Add some.

397
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,460
Add some coins.

398
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,460
I'm still a kid.

399
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,460
Yes.

400
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,460
I may be younger than you.

401
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,460
Yes.

402
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,460
Yes.

403
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,460
What are you looking at?

404
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,460
Okay.

405
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,460
Add ten more coins.

406
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,460
So rich.

407
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,460
Add some coins.

408
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,460
Five.

409
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,460
Go.

410
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,460
Go.

411
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,460
Four.

412
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,460
Ding.

413
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,460
Ding.

414
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,460
Ding.

415
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,460
One.

416
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,460
Two.

417
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,460
One pair of coins.

418
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,460
The second one is the right number.

419
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,460
You lied to me.

420
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,460
I lose if I bet.

421
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,460
How is it?

422
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,460
Is it fun?

423
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,460
You can have me if you can.

424
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,460
Yes.

425
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,460
Again.

426
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,460
Do you miss someone?

427
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,460
Yes.

428
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,460
Kuizhou is dying.

429
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,460
We three came out of the Western Regions.

430
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,460
We have only two left after Brother Lie died.

431
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,460
You joined and there are three left.

432
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,460
What are you?

433
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,460
But Young Master likes you.

434
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,460
He is happy to see you.

435
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,460
He is in the Southern Dynasty and he is in a good mood.

436
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,460
It may be better to kill you.

437
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,460
He is afraid that you are unhappy.

438
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,460
It's too complicated.

439
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,460
Too complicated.

440
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:36,460
From Kuizhou to Jiangning,

441
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,460
there is no difference between

442
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,460
my body and yours.

443
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,460
This is your reason.

444
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,460
I will untie you.

445
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,460
Can you move?

446
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,460
Can you talk?

447
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,460
When I was young,

448
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,460
I went to Bashan.

449
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,460
There are mountains,

450
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,460
roads and cliffs.

451
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,460
How can I not die

452
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,460
when I fall?

453
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:21,460
There is no one in this world.

454
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,460
What is the name of the person

455
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,460
who gave you the pill?

456
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,460
How did he save you?

457
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:35,460
Head, put me down.

458
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,460
Put me down.

459
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,460
Put me down.

460
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,460
Do you understand?

461
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,460
Put me down.

462
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,460
Let's move.

463
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,460
How?

464
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,460
I know a little about monogamy.

465
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:08,460
There are two ways to get a good monogamy.

466
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:18,460
First, it requires a lot of money.

467
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:23,460
Second, it requires a lot of time.

468
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:34,460
Third, it requires a lot of effort.

469
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:39,460
Fourth, it requires a lot of patience.

470
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:44,460
Fifth, it requires a lot of effort.

471
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:49,460
Sixth, it requires a lot of patience.

472
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:54,460
Seventh, it requires a lot of time.

473
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,460
Don't move.

474
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,460
I beg you to do me a favor.

475
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,460
Say it.

476
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:10,460
Kill me.

477
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:15,460
Everything has a cause and effect.

478
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:19,460
Your father died in my son's hands.

479
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:24,460
My son died in the hands of the one who gave you the pill.

480
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,460
He will be here soon.

481
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,460
You will see him.

482
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:34,460
I want him to keep his promise to my son.

483
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,460
Do you want to add more?

484
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,460
Did you see the sign?

485
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,460
I didn't see it.

486
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,460
It doesn't matter even if you see it.

487
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,460
I didn't see it.

488
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,460
I believe you.

489
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,460
Add more.

490
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,460
Give me a gold.

491
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,460
Young Master.

492
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,460
Give it to me.

493
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:01,460
Kid, you can't gamble for money.

494
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,460
I don't gamble.

495
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,460
Then why?

496
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,460
I don't believe it.

497
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,460
You should be good at family life.

498
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:13,460
You can't stand the frustration and anger.

499
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,460
You will hurt your body and money.

500
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:18,460
You will be drunk and strong.

501
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,460
I won't play with you.

502
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,460
You are not happy.

503
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,460
Just gamble.

504
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,460
Don't talk about the North.

505
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,460
I bet gold.

506
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,460
Dare or not?

507
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,460
It's too big.

508
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,460
I'm worried.

509
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,460
I don't want gold.

510
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,460
Add ten more.

511
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,460
Okay?

512
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,460
I'm afraid.

513
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,460
I've never been afraid in my life.

514
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,460
Start.

515
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,460
Go.

516
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,460
Is it big?

517
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,460
Wen Zi.

518
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,460
Is it big?

519
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,460
Double sky.

520
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,460
It's the same as my previous card.

521
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,460
It's the second card.

522
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,460
You are so arrogant.

523
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,460
Who is arrogant?

524
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,460
Open your card.

525
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,460
I'm so unlucky.

526
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,460
Blow.

527
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,460
Blow.

528
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:37,460
Ding.

529
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,460
Kid.

530
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,460
Sorry.

531
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:46,460
I'm so unlucky.

532
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,460
I can't meet you twice a year.

533
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,460
I'm so unlucky.

534
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,460
You.

535
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,460
Come.

536
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:17,460
You just took my secret three-day soul umbrella.

537
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,460
I'm so unlucky.

538
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,460
I'm so unlucky.

539
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,460
I'm so unlucky.

540
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,460
I'm so unlucky.

541
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,460
I'm so unlucky.

542
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,460
I'm so unlucky.

543
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,460
I'm so unlucky.

544
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,460
I'm so unlucky.

545
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,460
I'm so unlucky.

546
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,460
I'm so unlucky.

547
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,460
I'm so unlucky.

548
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,460
I'm so unlucky.

549
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,460
I'm so unlucky.

550
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,460
I'm so unlucky.

551
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,460
I turretults took the soul umbrella.

552
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:11,180
It's rocket of the

553
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:22,460
Do you want to come in?

554
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,460
What about you?

555
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,460
Imperial Physician Huang.

556
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,460
Physician Huang?

557
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,460
Is he willing to let her live?

558
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,460
He is.

559
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,460
Otherwise, he wouldn't have saved her in the Eight Hills.

560
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,460
How did you save her?

561
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,460
The bones around her

562
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,460
were broken into 70 pieces.

563
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,460
They were all fixed.

564
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,460
For her two pieces,

565
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,460
nine times the Yin Wheel Pill.

566
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,460
Nine times the Yin Wheel Pill?

567
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,460
It was practiced many years ago.

568
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,460
There are only seven in the world.

569
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,460
Now there are only five left.

570
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,460
In order to save her,

571
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,460
are you willing to die?

572
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,460
Why did you choose to do so?

573
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,460
Because I have no grudge against her.

574
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,460
You killed my son.

575
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,460
Since she is dead,

576
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,460
don't care too much.

577
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,460
It's no use caring.

578
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,460
If you don't care,

579
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,460
you will feel better.

580
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,460
I don't care.

581
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,460
It makes sense.

582
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,460
Take me away.

583
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,460
I'm sorry.

584
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,460
In the Yizhan Valley,

585
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,460
I can't take you.

586
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,460
Forget it.

587
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,460
Then why did you come back?

588
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,460
My brother,

589
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,460
Ouyang Feng, said

590
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,460
we should meet.

591
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,460
What you said just now

592
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,460
makes sense.

593
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,460
I'm sorry.

594
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,460
Since my son is dead,

595
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,460
don't care too much.

596
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,460
It's no use caring.

597
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,460
It's great

598
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,460
that you think so.

599
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,460
I have long vowed

600
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,460
not to kill.

601
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,460
I had no choice

602
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,460
at that time.

603
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,460
You and him

604
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,460
have no personal feelings.

605
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,460
My subordinate said

606
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,460
we just met by chance.

607
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,460
We don't know each other.

608
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,460
Now,

609
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,460
we only meet for the third time.

610
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,460
I take back what I said just now.

611
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,460
Let's change our way of saying it.

612
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,460
Let him live.

613
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,460
You can kill your brother,

614
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,460
Ouyang Feng.

615
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,460
Why do you have to choose?

616
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,460
Because no one can stop you.

617
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,460
You don't want to take him away.

618
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,460
I just

619
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,460
gave him

620
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,460
my secret

621
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,460
three-day soul-losing pill.

622
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,460
He won't remember

623
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,460
the person he knew

624
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,460
when he was young.

625
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,460
He won't know

626
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,460
who he is tomorrow.

627
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,460
At this time in the day after tomorrow,

628
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,460
he will

629
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,460
be scattered.

630
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,460
Before the day after tomorrow,

631
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,460
bring your brother Ouyang Feng

632
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,460
to see me.

633
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,460
To detoxify him.

634
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,460
Let him go.

635
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,460
The past is a mess.

636
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,460
I will protect him.

637
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,460
I will keep my words.

638
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,460
Go.

639
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,460
Oh my god.

640
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,460
I'm leaving.

641
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,460
Go.

642
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,460
I'm leaving.

643
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,460
I won't come back.

644
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,460
Don't come back.

645
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,460
The one who doesn't remember the past

646
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,460
is a good person.

647
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,460
It's better to be scattered.

648
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,460
In this world,

649
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,460
what else

650
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,460
do you want me to do for you?

651
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,460
This one thing,

652
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,460
don't listen to him

653
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,460
and kill your brother.

654
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,460
Live well in this world.

655
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,460
The longer, the better.

656
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,460
This painting,

657
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,460
someone told me

658
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,460
it's exactly the same.

659
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,460
Go.

660
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,460
Let's part ways.

661
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,460
I will be with you.

662
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,460
I will be with you.

663
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,460
I will be with you.

664
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,460
I will be with you.

665
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,460
I will be with you.

666
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,460
What's your name?

667
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,460
Feng Heng.

668
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,460
Feng Heng.

669
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,460
Get out!

670
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,460
Go!

671
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,460
Get out!

672
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,460
Calm down.

673
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,460
Calm down.

674
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,460
Let's buy a new one.

675
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,460
You can buy a new one.

676
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,460
Today's first day is going so smoothly.

677
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,460
Everyone is happy.

678
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,460
Thank you.

679
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,460
Thank you.

680
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,460
Thank you.

681
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,460
Look at him.

682
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,460
Give it to him.

683
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,460
Prime Minister, these people

684
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,460
are shameless.

685
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,460
I admit defeat.

686
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,460
I'm just being honest.

687
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,460
My friend is very good.

688
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,460
I like you.

689
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,460
Why don't you burn this place down?

690
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,460
Kill these shameless people.

691
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,460
Give me the gold.

692
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,460
Let's go.

693
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,460
Don't be angry.

694
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,460
What is he doing?

695
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,460
Just let it go.

696
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,460
Then I'll be shameless.

697
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,460
Yes.

698
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,460
Happy today?

699
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,460
Very satisfied.

700
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,460
Take two pieces of gold.

701
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,460
What are you playing?

702
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,460
Let's go.

703
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,460
You want to leave?

704
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,460
What did you say?

705
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,460
Give me the gold.

706
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,460
Again.

707
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,460
Two pieces.

708
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,460
I don't believe it.

709
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,460
You're a bad mouth.

710
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,460
I'll talk to you later.

711
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,460
Okay.

712
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,460
I'll see where you're going.

713
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,460
What's your name?

714
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,460
Ouyang Feng.

715
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,460
I'm Chai Qiong.

716
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,460
I'll let you be honest today.

717
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,460
I'll teach you how to be a person.

718
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,460
Show your cards.

719
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,460
I'm nervous.

720
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,460
You two are so handsome.

721
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,460
That's right.

722
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,460
You're a bad mouth.

723
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,460
You're a bad mouth.

724
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,460
You're a bad mouth.

725
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,460
Don't laugh.

726
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,460
I'm not bad.

727
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,460
Sir, you're a good mouth.

728
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,460
Only Lingling is less good than him.

729
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,460
Sir, you're a good mouth.

730
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,460
You don't have to be happy.

731
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,460
No need to worry.

732
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,460
Don't be angry.

733
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,460
Go, go, go.

734
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,460
No more water.

735
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,460
Master's treasure

736
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,460
kill the four of them.

737
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,460
I'm so happy.

738
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,460
I'll kill you guys.

739
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,460
Sit and eat.

740
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,100
Water usage.

741
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,500
Then you're willing to accept me to be your governing body,

742
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:58,300
sent me to Chuhua Tower.

743
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,420
If you want a horse,

744
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,460
say yes or no.

745
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:04,860
H..H..

746
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:08,660
Wow!

747
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,540
Oops!

748
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:11,820
Stupid f.. tu..

749
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,780
Good horse!

750
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,500
Well,

751
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:16,780
should I

752
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:17,860
No.

753
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,860
I'll sell it at the market tomorrow morning

754
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,180
Yes, Master Chen

755
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,460
That's how Ma became his?

756
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,100
Come on, let's go

757
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,980
Ouyang Feng, my friend

758
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:33,580
It's good news that you lost

759
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,780
Go back to find Brother Yao

760
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,580
You're leaving just like that?

761
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,420
No, you can't leave

762
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,060
I was not clean-mouthed just now

763
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,420
I want to apologize

764
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,860
Young Master, you heard it

765
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,540
Jin Zi and Ma gave him

766
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,220
and you want to apologize to him?

767
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,220
How?

768
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,620
You're good

769
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,140
He can apologize

770
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,420
He's my man

771
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:01,220
He should apologize to me

772
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,820
You should apologize to him too

773
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,780
Give me the gold

774
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,060
Zhao, don't hurt anyone

775
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,180
Apologize is not enough

776
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,140
Kneel down and kowtow

777
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,260
I'll let you go

778
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,540
It's not too late to kneel down

779
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,140
I'll let you kneel down

780
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,900
Two more

781
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,060
You know martial arts?

782
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,580
Not much

783
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,980
Do you want to learn?

784
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,620
I'm willing to admit defeat

785
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,820
He scolded you

786
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,740
You just hit him

787
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:58,300
Let's go our separate ways, OK?

788
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,900
No

789
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,860
Don't hit me

790
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,660
I don't want to hurt you

791
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,820
Come on

792
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,740
I won, you can have the gold

793
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,420
Give me one

794
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,460
Give me one

795
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,620
Yes, only one hand

796
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:20,020
You want to find the rose yourself

797
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,500
He's good at martial arts

798
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,220
but he's good at fighting

799
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,540
Now you see

800
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,380
I'll fight with you

801
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:58,660
My hi

802
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:59,660
I'm Xin Ji

803
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,140
Really?

804
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,100
Come on

805
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,060
Your fight cant have this

806
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:03,860
negócio

807
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,020
Good

808
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,300
Go

809
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,100
You...

810
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,020
You've been so angry since the first move.

811
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,620
You can't stand any grievance.

812
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,020
Your moves are bad.

813
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,100
Your martial arts are also bad.

814
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:26,340
Well,

815
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,420
I'll give you a leg

816
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,020
to teach you a lesson.

817
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:35,020
What martial arts?

818
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:37,180
Nothing special.

819
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,780
I haven't fought with people for years.

820
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:42,060
I'm happy today.

821
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,540
I'm also good at fighting.

822
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:44,420
Come on.

823
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:48,220
I'll let you learn the Western Baituo Mountain's martial arts.

824
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,300
It's a little difficult.

825
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:15,240
Composer,

826
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,480
o Official,

827
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,440
is a good move.

828
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,280
An eunuch like me

829
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:22,920
only has to need powerful moves and martial arts.

830
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,280
He's good, isn't he?

831
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,000
Your...

832
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,380
Your attack pasayed to my hand.

833
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,240
I won't let you be fought by anyone.

834
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,240
What's your identity, Wu Lin of the Southern Dynasty?

835
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,240
Don't talk about Wu Lin

836
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,240
I'm just a gambler

837
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,240
Don't talk about the Southern Dynasty

838
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,240
People from the north and the west should know

839
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,240
This is the Song Dynasty

840
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,240
Wu Lin of the Southern Dynasty, are you the best?

841
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,240
Why do you still talk about the Southern Dynasty?

842
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,240
Song Dynasty!

843
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,240
Are you the best?

844
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,240
You're happy if you lose to the best?

845
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,240
At least you're the second or third?

846
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,240
Little friend

847
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,240
Everything is as usual

848
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,240
The king is like gambling

849
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,240
The next game, you lose

850
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,240
Don't talk about the rules with me

851
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,240
You're really a bad guy

852
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,240
I'm Cuihua Tower

853
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,240
The best in martial arts

854
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,240
Jiangling is also the best

855
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,240
The Song Dynasty

856
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,240
Song Dynasty?

857
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,240
Who dares to say the first?

858
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,240
Excuse me, where is Cuihua Tower's horse house?

859
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,240
Where is it?

860
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,240
Turn left

861
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,240
Thanks

862
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,240
You and Ouyang Feng are a team, right?

863
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,240
It's okay

864
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,240
Relax his heart

865
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,240
Life is a little more open

866
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,240
I'm going back to quit gambling

867
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,240
Today's handover is too smooth

868
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,240

869
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,240
