Don't tell anyone about what happened just now.

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,920
We don't know anyone in Nanchang.

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,360
Who should we tell?

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,680
Brother Ouyang.

00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:26,720

I'm looking for you inside.

My brother said you were in the stable.

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,840
I'm here to see you.

11
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:34,800
What's wrong?

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,920
Are you hungry, Brother Yao?

00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:40,920
I'm not hungry.

14
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,320
I'm not that hungry either.

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,480
If you're hungry,

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,200
I can go eat with you.

I'm hungry.

137
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,060
There are many people in the world. You don't need to go back

138
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,300
I know

139
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,900
Stay with me

140
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,220
I treat you as my son

141
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,460
Is that okay?

142
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,380
I'm willing to help you

143
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,940
to get to the bottom of the earth

144
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,460
Get up

145
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,460
I'm sorry

146
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,620
Do you think

147
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,900
Huang Yaoshi

148
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,820
will kill Ouyang Feng

149
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,460
for her?

150
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,500
I don't know

151
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,500
He will

152
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,100
A man

153
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,820
can do anything for a woman

154
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,020
Chief

155
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,460
Do you need to send some masters?

156
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,620
Master Shi Xing

157
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,420
went to Lin'an in the daytime

158
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,460
to meet Master Dan

159
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,340
If he is at home

160
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,420
he can deal with Huang Yaoshi

161
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,140
The 13th Taigao of Jiangling City

162
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,900
is under the control of the Wuze

163
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,980
Either he is not Huang Yaoshi's opponent

164
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,460
or Yuan Shui can't solve the Jin Ke

165
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,100
The masters of the Chai family

166
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,780
have something to do

167
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,460
Chief

168
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,620
I'm the master of the Chai family

169
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,020
The master of the Chai family?

170
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,660
My family can't even afford this chair

171
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,940
Chief, Shi Qi can't talk

172
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,340
Call me when Huang Yaoshi comes back

173
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,780
He will call you when he arrives

174
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,260
What if he takes this woman away?

175
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,300
One day come he won't

176
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,420
Yes

177
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:23,580
We…

178
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,860
Huang Yaoshi is taking her away

179
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,380
Not everyone can stop him

180
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,460
I'm so confused

181
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,460
I'll have a hard life in the future

182
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,460
Do you care about the money?

183
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,460
Money is nothing

184
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,460
I'm sorry, Brother Yao

185
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,460
I didn't count the money on the way

186
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,460
I lost three horses

187
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:10,460
I have something to discuss with you

188
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,460
Tell me

189
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,460
I'll give you a full share as a brother

190
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,460
Wait

191
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,460
I know what to call her

192
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,460
Who?

193
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,460
Feng Heng

194
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,460
The woman who makes you upset?

195
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,460
A poor woman

196
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,460
So you've been thinking about her

197
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,460
I didn't think about her either

198
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,460
Then bring her here

199
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:46,460
What if she wants to make a bet with you?

200
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,460
What?

201
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,460
Me?

202
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,460
With her?

203
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,460
I've been to Yanbang for a long time

204
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:59,460
I haven't made new friends for many years

205
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,460
Many, many years

206
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,460
To be honest

207
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,460
I've never made friends in my life

208
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,460
I was born in Kunlanshan at the age of ten

209
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,460
I was born at the age of 23

210
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,460
After that, I was alone

211
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,460
You're my only friend

212
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,460
What kind of woman?

213
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,460
She has no woman

214
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,460
Why do you think so?

215
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,460
I didn't think so

216
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,460
The head of Yanbang, Hu Qianshou, said so

217
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,460
That's what it means

218
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,460
I'll choose one between him and me

219
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,460
Either I die or he dies

220
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,460
He poisoned Feng Heng

221
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,460
How can you give up your martial arts?

222
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,460
What does it have to do with martial arts?

223
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,460
You've seen my martial arts in Kuizhou's restaurant

224
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,460
Are you strong?

225
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,460
Yes

226
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,460
I won't die for nothing, will I?

227
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,460
Brother Yao, I'm very sad

228
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,460
I didn't expect you to be so crazy

229
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,460
I'm upset

230
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,460
So I'm here to ask you

231
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,460
You said you had something to discuss with me

232
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,460
Are you going to ask me?

233
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,460
Just take your life

234
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,460
It's not good to talk about it

235
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,460
Since you're my brother, just tell me

236
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,460
I'm fine

237
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,460
You shouldn't be fine

238
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,460
Do you know how sad I am?

239
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,460
Do you know what happened just now?

240
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,460
A man should take responsibility for what he should take responsibility for

241
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:31,460
If he can't take responsibility, he should take responsibility in any way

242
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,460
Do you know the sky has fallen?

243
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,460
You asked me to discuss it

244
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,460
Who should I discuss it with?

245
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:43,460
Brother Ouyang, I'm wrong

246
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,460
I'm wrong

247
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,460
Actually, it's not that you and he are hard to give up

248
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,460
It's that I'm hard to give up

249
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,460
It's ridiculous

250
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,460
I don't need your attention

251
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,460
I'm not afraid of you

252
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,460
I don't need your attention

253
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,460
I see you as my brother

254
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,460
You only care about yourself

255
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,460
You're so sad

256
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,460
Did anything happen besides money?

257
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,460
What can I do?

258
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,460
What else can I do?

259
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,460
You're in a good mood

260
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,460
I know

261
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,460
It's good that you know

262
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,460
Wait for me

263
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,460
Wait for me here

264
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,460
Wait for me here

265
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,460
How can I only think about myself?

266
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,460
How can I only think about myself?

267
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,460
I'm not good

268
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,460
I'm sorry

269
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,460
I'm not good

270
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,460
I'm sorry, Brother Ouyang

271
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,460
I'm not good

272
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,460
What did you say?

273
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,460
I'm sorry

274
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,460
Big or small, it's up to you

275
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,460
I like big

276
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,460
I like big

277
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,460
How about big?

278
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,460
Big

279
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,460
It's up to you

280
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,460
Big or small, it's up to you

281
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,460
Big

282
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,460
Big

283
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,460
Small or big

284
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,460
Small

285
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,460
Big

286
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,460
Mr. Lu, please wait

287
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,460
I want this flute

288
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,460
to bring back my brother Ouyang Feng's book

289
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,460
What are you laughing at?

290
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,460
Why don't you take a look at this flute?

291
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,460
Kunlun Mountain is ancient and beautiful

292
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,460
Okay

293
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,460
Buy big or small

294
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,460
Buy or sell

295
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,460
I don't care about money

296
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,460
He doesn't care

297
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,460
He's just upset without money

298
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,460
What are you betting?

299
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,460
This flute

300
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,460
is a must

301
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,460
Do you want to bet?

302
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,460
How?

303
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,460
It's up to you

304
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,460
Me too

305
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,460
Young Master, the people of the Forbidden City Hall

306
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,460
Don't be nervous

307
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,460
We're not here to fight

308
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,460
I want to fight

309
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,460
My lady wants to talk to your young master

310
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,460
in there

311
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,460
Give me a life

312
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,460
Okay

313
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,460
After the lady says

314
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,460
if you want to fight

315
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,460
I'll fight with you alone

316
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,460
If you're good at martial arts

317
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,460
you can take my life

318
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,460
Where are you from?

319
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,460
I said in Kuizhou

320
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,460
I didn't hear you

321
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,460
Jin Tang, the son of Lin An

322
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,460
Eight seats on the side, wooden seat

323
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,460
Pan Jie

324
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,460
Eat or talk first?

325
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,460
Who are you?

326
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,460
I don't know you

327
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,460
You look familiar

328
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,460
I dressed up like this

329
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,460
Why?

330
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,460
I don't know

331
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,460
Why do you dress up like this?

332
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,460
I'm a woman

333
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,460
I can't do this?

334
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,460
What's your own mind?

335
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,460
Or you want to be comfortable?

336
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,460
You feel comfortable?

337
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,460
Anyway, you're a broad-sleeved man

338
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,460
with a long sleeve

339
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,460
and a long sleeve

340
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,460
I'm not comfortable

341
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,460
I'm not comfortable

342
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,460
You're a broad-sleeved man

343
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,460
with a long sleeve

344
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,460
and a long sleeve

345
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,460
I'm not comfortable

346
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,460
I know

347
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,460
But you don't care about anything

348
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,460
Get out

349
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,460
Get out

350
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,460
I said

351
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,460
men are hateful

352
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,460
What's your name?

353
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,460
I'm not looking for you

354
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,460
Don't you forget me?

355
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,460
I don't forget you

356
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,460
Dan Min

357
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,460
Yes

358
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,460
My lady likes your young master

359
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,460
Nonsense

360
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,460
Young master

361
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,460
Do you want to talk?

362
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,460
What do you mean?

363
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,460
This is the best restaurant

364
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,460
and the best wine and dishes

365
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,460
Do you want to try?

366
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,460
Young master

367
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,460
Get out

368
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,460
I'm listening

369
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,460
Who are you?

370
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,460
Sister Lian, don't worry

371
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,460
Get out

372
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,460
Come and have a drink

373
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,460
I only invite you

374
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,460
No one else

375
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,460
Young master, be careful of the poison

376
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,460
There are five people here

377
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,460
You two need to be poisoned

378
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,460
Get out

379
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,460
I'll talk to him

380
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,460
I was going to find you

381
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,460
and send you to the door

382
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,460
After I finish talking

383
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,460
you come one by one

384
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,460
I'll kill you first

385
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,460
Why should I come one by one with you?

386
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,460
Eat

387
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,460
Eat

388
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,460
You have something to say

389
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,460
Eat

390
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,460
Why don't you eat?

391
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,460
I'm not hungry

392
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,460
Wine, I'll have a bite

393
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,460
You have a bite

394
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,460
Meat

395
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,460
I have a bite

396
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,460
You have a bite

397
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,460
I'm a big mouth

398
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,460
Why do you have to let me eat?

399
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,460
If you don't eat

400
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,460
I'm nervous

401
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,460
I'm not nervous

402
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,460
If I kill the three people in Ba County

403
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,460
I'll tell you the truth

404
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,460
A man should not talk in a word

405
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,460
I know

406
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,460
You don't care

407
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,460
You believe it?

408
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,460
Yes

409
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,460
Why do you come here?

410
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,460
I want to find it myself

411
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,460
They are afraid you hit me again

412
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,460
They want to follow me

413
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,460
Eat

414
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,460
I never treat people like this

415
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,460
If you don't appreciate

416
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,460
don't blame me

417
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,460
Drink

418
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,460
Drink

419
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,460
Drink

420
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,460
Drink

421
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,460
Drink

422
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,460
Drink

423
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,460
Drink

424
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,460
Drink

425
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,460
You are playing with the sword

426
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,460
It turns out that a gold is enough

427
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,460
You are the one who doesn't let me go

428
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,460
Come again

429
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,460
Two last drops

430
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,460
Three books in a row

431
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,460
You don't believe it?

432
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,460
Don't be angry

433
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,460
Who is angry?

434
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,460
What time is it now?

435
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,460
I have something to do before the show

436
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,460
I really have to go

437
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,460
Are you afraid?

438
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,460
Don't go

439
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,460
You are so bad

440
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,460
You are so bad

441
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,460
Don't go

442
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,460
Don't go

443
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,460
How about this?

444
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,460
You win

445
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,460
One last bet

446
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,460
If I lose

447
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,460
the gold of the 12 stores

448
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,460
will be yours

449
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,460
If you lose

450
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,460
the two stores will still be yours

451
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,460
But I have to trouble you

452
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,460
to go to Jiangdong and Xifang

453
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,460
to meet a small store

454
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,460
and hand the 10 stores to my friend

455
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,460
Ouyang Feng

456
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,460
Do you know him?

457
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,460
What kind of gambling is this?

458
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,460
I bet two

459
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,460
and you bet 12

460
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,460
It's not fair

461
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,460
I have to trouble you to go to Jiangdong

462
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,460
It's fair

463
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,460
Bet

464
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,460
Big bet or small bet

465
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,460
Go

466
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,460
I bet small

467
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,460
I bet small

468
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,460
Wait

469
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,460
Put your hands under the table

470
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,460
I bet big

471
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,460
It's still small

472
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,460
What's wrong?

473
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,460
What's wrong?

474
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,460
What's wrong?

475
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,460
Good shot

476
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,460
I'm in a bad mood today

477
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,460
Just tell me

478
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,460
Don't always eat and drink

479
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,460
What's wrong?

480
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,460
Tell me

481
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,460
None of your business

482
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,460
It's bad

483
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,460
You were not like this before

484
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,460
You are so ugly

485
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,460
You are so ugly

486
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,460
I will dress up

487
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,460
whatever you like

488
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,460
Are you crazy?

489
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,460
My men died in Kuizhou

490
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,460
I don't care about you

491
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,460
I will tell you a story

492
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,460
I'm not in the mood

493
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,460
You told me one in Kuizhou

494
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,460
Why can't I tell you now?

495
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,460
Come here

496
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,460
Sit down

497
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,460
Be simple

498
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,460
My brother is called Dan Xinbian

499
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,460
Have you heard of it?

500
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,460
Is it a story?

501
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,460
I can tell you a hundred stories

502
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,460
I told you

503
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,460
Listen

504
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,460
My brother Dan Xinbian is the master of the Zijing Hall

505
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,460
The best master of the Song Wulin

506
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,460
I'm 21 years old, how old are you?

507
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,460
Your brother

508
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,460
The best master of the Song Wulin

509
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,460
How many best masters are there in the Song Dynasty?

510
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,460
How old are you?

511
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,460
Older than you

512
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,460
From the age of 16

513
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,460
My brother asked no one to tell me three times

514
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,460
The first time

515
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,460
The son of the Grand Minister of the Taichang Temple

516
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,460
The second time

517
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,460
The son of the Comrade of the Shumi Academy

518
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,460
The third time

519
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,460
The commander of the Ministry of War

520
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,460
They all hit me

521
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,460
Why?

522
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,460
The whole world

523
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,460
Only you dare to touch me

524
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,460
What are you going to say?

525
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,460
Annoying

526
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,460
My brother asked me to join the government

527
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,460
I don't want

528
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,460
But I don't know what I want

529
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,460
Until a few days ago

530
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,460
I met a person

531
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,460
He told me

532
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,460
The man should walk in all directions

533
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,460
Don't think about the future

534
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,460
When you meet someone you like

535
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,460
You will be together for a day

536
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,460
A lifetime

537
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,460
What should we do?

538
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,460
You are the one I like

539
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,460
I will go everywhere with you

540
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,460
I will spend many lifetimes with you

541
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,460
I will be on your side

542
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,460
I will be in your care

543
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,460
I will go wherever you want

544
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,460
You are confused

545
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,460
Is that what you want to say?

546
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,460
You are confused

547
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,780
You're so annoying

548
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,580
Friend

549
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,780
Let's settle the account of brother Lie first

550
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,780
Who is your friend?

551
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,140
Dami

552
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,860
Let's settle the account of brother Lie first

553
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,140
Who is brother Lie?

554
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,540
My men died in Fuyamai, Kuizhou

555
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,980
Buried outside Kuizhou

556
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:11,860
Ok

557
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,740
Kill me

558
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,740
I'll kill you

559
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,940
You dare to poison me?

560
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,020
I

561
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,900
You really poison the leeks

562
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,340
I really like you

563
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,180
How can I poison you?

564
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,300
I can use Ouyang Feng

565
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,620
But I don't need to poison you

566
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,940
Just do it

567
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,380
I'm not going to poison you

568
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,580
I'm not going to poison you

569
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,620
I'm not going to poison you

570
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,740
I'm not going to poison you

571
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,940
I'm not going to poison you

572
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,380
Just do it, Ouyang Feng

573
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,940
I like you with my life

574
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,940
They all know it

575
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,540
The whole martial arts world will know it soon

576
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,060
If you don't like me

577
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,940
I'm ashamed to see people

578
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,740
You'd better kill me

579
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,740
Why do you women say that?

580
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,140
Which woman?

581
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,580
Where is the woman?

582
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,020
Where is the woman?

583
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,580
Brother Yao said he met a woman

584
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,980
She's a woman who makes him upset

585
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,460
She said she would kill him if he didn't take her away

586
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,540
What if I make you upset?

587
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,220
It's a mess at the beginning

588
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,820
It's a mess before you came

589
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:51,020
I've never met a man like you

590
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,540
I'll be very obedient

591
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,380
Be my friend, okay?

592
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:18,860
Not enough

593
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,780
I'll be your friend

594
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,900
From now on, your business is my business

595
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,820
Really?

596
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,220
Ouyang Feng never lies

597
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,020
Not enough

598
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,660
Forget it

599
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,140
A man and a woman should keep their promise

600
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,820
How can I like a woman like you?

601
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,580
Then kill me

602
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,020
I'm not angry

603
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,020
I'll kill you

604
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,720
Xu time

605
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,640
I'll kill you

606
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,020
You are not supposed to fight

607
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,020
Miss, this is poisonous.

608
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:23,900
Ouyang Feng, are you going to admit defeat?

609
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,860
It's not too late to admit defeat now.

610
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,060
Miss.

611
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,500
Let's return Liege's life first.

612
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,020
I'm going to let him run away.

613
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:20,980
And after the end of the game.

614
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,180
Two against one, it's not fair.

615
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:54,940
Tengcks Twitter

616
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,300
Lift

617
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,620
Come, it's

618
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,420
Pux employers

619
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,620
There are eight sit-ups died tonight

620
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,500
It's okay to be your brother

621
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:15,960
конт

622
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,020
The Yan Gang's.

623
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,380
I put the drug in the leek.

624
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,940
It had nothing to do with you.

625
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,780
Our lady wanted to get you in.

626
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,020
Young Master.

627
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:18,820
Ye Lin.

628
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,660
What are you doing here?

629
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,660
Young Master.

630
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,180
See?

631
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,820
Be careful.

632
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:17,900
wrestlers,

633
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,880
fight and make Diego

634
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,520
Iranian

635
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,020
keep yourself in defense

636
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,500
ventilator

637
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,100
with no time to go

638
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,740
Yanma

639
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,560
Still

640
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:42,100
Kn valleys

641
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,240
I

642
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,560
think

643
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,200
Go.

644
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,040
The West Japaners killed Brother Pan.

645
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,680
Save Miss first.

646
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,080
Go.

647
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,160
The West Japaners can't stay.

648
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,360
They know

649
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,960
I poisoned the elixir

650
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,240
and killed Pan Jian.

651
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,600
ishi.

652
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,080
I was really wrong.

653
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,000
I

654
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,120
want your bars.

655
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,240
Just speak your mind.

656
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,640
Despicable girl.

657
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,400
You poisoned it.

658
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,600
Time to explain a little.

659
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,760
It's not that I did something stupid.

660
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,480
I justzeńred Miss Dan Ming

661
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,520
for Dufan.

662
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,220
Where are you going to medical

663
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,500
Where is Dan Min?

664
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:48,140
Miss Dan has something to do with you

665
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:48,940
My friend

666
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,060
What are you doing?

667
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,620
Master Cai

668
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:17,660
Did you kill the fish?

669
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,420
Who?

670
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:23,420
The two people who died in Baixuan

671
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,340
No

672
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,420
I'm not lying

673
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,940
I'm really sorry

674
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,820
What are you doing?

675
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,900
I'm here to stop the death of Master Cai

676
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,420
Did you kill him?

677
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,300
Yes

678
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,980
Bastard

679
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,620
Isn't the minister powerful enough?

680
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,260
He dares to hide

681
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,180
Isn't the minister powerful enough?

682
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,540
He is conquering the martial art world

683
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,420
Why can't he get through with a Western person?

684
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,940
Master Cai knows him

685
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:19,020
He just met him

686
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,300
I like him very much

687
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,700
I'll report to Master Cai

688
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,020
Master Cai killed him

689
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,020
Make it clear

690
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:31,180
I killed Ouyang Feng

691
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,380
Yes

692
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,060
And the one outside

693
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:37,900
Yes

694
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,820
What's your name?

695
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,580
Hu

696
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:51,740
Anjie

697
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:58,540
You are finally June

698
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,820
General跟我说

699
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,900
Hu

700
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,700
What do you want?

701
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,620
귀不起

702
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:14,620
I'm ashamed to think about it

703
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,380
I won't hurt my brother

704
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,860
It's okay. I've thought about it

705
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,180
But the grudge is coming

706
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,460
The incense inside

707
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,420
has been removed

708
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,860
The grudge is gone

709
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:37,580
Just go in and put out the incense

710
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:43,820
Master Yao, let's take a few steps over there

711
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:55,180
Master Yao, I heard you talking in the daytime

712
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:59,380
Are you going to take him away now?

713
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,580
Not really

714
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,580
I'm sorry

715
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:08,820
I've thought about it after you left

716
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:13,020
I shouldn't have made it difficult for him and you

717
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,100
My son died

718
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:22,220
He blamed me for doing many things I had to do

719
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:26,380
If a man doesn't do good, he will be punished

720
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:30,740
Besides, a man can't be reborn

721
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:41,460
Please forget what your brother said

722
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:44,940
Feng Hong will take him away

723
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:49,300
You can take it as a good deed

724
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,500
Chief Hong, to be honest

725
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,180
I haven't made up my mind yet

726
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,580
Why?

727
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:04,700
I can't let go of what happened before

728
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:10,300
You can't let go of him now either

729
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,300
Is it okay?

730
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:23,500
Three days of umbrella must be cleaned every day

731
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:28,500
Only after three days can the poison be completely eliminated

732
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:32,700
I'm going to Jiangzhou tomorrow

733
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:37,300
I'll take him with me on the way

734
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:41,900
If you're comfortable, I'll prepare a good horse for you

735
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,700
You can follow us

736
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:47,100
If you want to see him, you should come up and see him

737
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:52,900
I'll come up and see him every day

738
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,300
Three days are up

739
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,700
I want to take him away

740
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,300
If I haven't made up my mind yet

741
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:06,900
I will be good to him

742
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,900
Why do you do this?

743
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,500
I'm a businessman

744
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:19,100
You know what's good for you

745
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,300
You're so good at martial arts

746
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,100
I can take revenge on you

747
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:27,100
Why don't I make it easy for you?

748
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,500
How can I thank you?

749
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:37,100
It's good to have a heart to thank me

750
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,300
I'm going to Jiangzhou tomorrow

751
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,700
I'll take you with me

752
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,700
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

753
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

754
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,100
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

755
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,700
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

756
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

757
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,700
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

758
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

759
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

760
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

761
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

762
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

763
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

764
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

765
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

766
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

767
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

768
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

769
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

770

00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

777
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

778
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

780
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

781
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

782
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

783
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

784
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

785
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

786
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

787
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

788
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

789
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

790
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

791
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

792
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

793
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

794
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

795
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

796
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

797
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

798
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou tomorrow

799
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,300
I'll take you to Jiangzhou overcome

800
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,300
YES

801
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,300
YES

802
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,300
YES

803
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,300
S electron is so slow

804
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,300
YES

805
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,300
YES

806
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,300
YES

807
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,300
I will not kill my brother.

808
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,300
Are you leaving again?

809
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,500
No hurry.

810
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,300
Stand for a while more.

811
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,300
It's okay.

812
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,700
Go.

813
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,700
I'll wait for Huang Yaoshi here.

814
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,300
I'll wait for you.

815
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,300
I'll wait for you.

816
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,300
Go.

817
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,300
The food that Chief Hu sent you,

818
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,300
you didn't eat it, right?

819
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,300
I ate a little.

820
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,300
What did you eat?

821
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,300
There are chrysanthemum in the food.

822
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,300
I will faint if I eat chrysanthemum.

823
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,300
Like drinking poisonous wine.

824
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,300
Thank you for coming back.

825
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:04,300
Why would chrysanthemum be poisoned?

826
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,300
Ordinary people don't.

827
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,300
I will.

828
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:12,300
Winter chrysanthemum is more afraid to touch.

829
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,300
Why?

830
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,300
Winter, the roots are deep,

831
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,300
less light.

832
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,300
After the chrysanthemum is fattened,

833
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,300
it will dry up a lot in summer.

834
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,300
The southern chrysanthemum is not as good as the northern one.

835
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,300
The roots of Kunlun Mountain are thick.

836
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,300
After the year of the south,

837
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,300
Song, Jin, Jiang, and Jie

838
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,300
are divided into Qin, Ling, Huai, He and Fen, South and North.

839
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,300
Ordinary chrysanthemum

840
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,300
is from the local Song Dynasty.

841
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,300
The father of Yan.

842
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,300
The chrysanthemum here

843
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,300
should be from the north of Qin, Huai and Yi.

844
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,300
It's possible that it's from Kunlun Mountain.

845
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:46,300
You are very knowledgeable

846
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,300
in cooking.

847
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,300
No.

848
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:52,300
But it's delicious.

849
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:54,300
You know herbs?

850
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,300
I don't.

851
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:00,300
But I know a little.

852
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,300
You have been to Kunlun?

853
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,300
No.

854
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,300
I went to school with my father.

855
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,300
The books are very messy.

856
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,300
I won't forget it after reading.

857
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,300
But you can't forget

858
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,300
some things

859
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:18,300
that are very bitter.

860
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:24,300
I told you in the day time

861
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,300
to live well.

862
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,300
The longer, the better.

863
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,300
You said a long time ago

864
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,300
that I was the same as you said.

865
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,300
It was a long time ago.

866
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,300
There was a person

867
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,300
who was very weak.

868
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,300
When he was ten years old,

869
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,300
I went to Kunlun Mountain

870
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,300
and used my body

871
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,300
to give him medicine.

872
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,300
He called me a drug addict.

873
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,300
I almost died

874
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,300
several times in the first year.

875
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:06,300
The second year was better.

876
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:10,300
The fourth year,

877
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,300
I started to get along with him.

878
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:16,300
It's like

879
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,300
a piece of sugar

880
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,300
and two fruits.

881
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,300
It depends on who wants to eat who's oxygen.

882
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,300
The fifth year,

883
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,300
he started to get more and more beautiful.

884
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,300
The sixth year,

885
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,300
he started

886
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,300
to miss me who was about to die.

887
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,300
The eighth year,

888
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,300
he died.

889
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,300
The ninth year,

890
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,300
he turned his heart around

891
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,300
and gave me

892
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,300
all his oxygen.

893
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,300
The ninth year,

894
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,300
he said,

895
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,300
in this world,

896
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,300
live well.

897
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,300
The longer, the better.

898
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:16,300
Don't say it anymore.

899
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,300
If you keep saying it,

900
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,300
you'll be sad.

901
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,300
I've never said this to anyone.

902
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,300
If I don't say it,

903
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,300
I'll forget it.

904
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,300
Actually, you didn't forget.

905
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,300
You just pretend to forget.

906
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,300
We've been together for a short time.

907
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:48,300
Why don't you

908
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,300
say something happy?

909
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,300
Are you leaving again?

910
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,300
I'm leaving.

911
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,300
I'm leaving.

912
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,300
I'm leaving.

913
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,300
I'm leaving.

914
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:54,300
I'm leaving.

915
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,300
I'm leaving.

916
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,300
I'm leaving.

917
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:00,300
I'm leaving.

918
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:02,300
I'm leaving.

919
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,300
I'm leaving.

920
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:06,300
I'm leaving.

921
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,300
I'm leaving.

922
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:10,300
I'm leaving.

923
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,300
I'm leaving.

924
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,300
I'm leaving.
