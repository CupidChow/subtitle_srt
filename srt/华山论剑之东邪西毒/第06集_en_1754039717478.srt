1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,380
We are closer to fuckin' hell.

2
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,720
Please stand up, Young Master.

3
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:49,800
Privy Lord Chu,

4
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,960
Waiting for you in the stage are all my mistakes,

5
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,560
I'd never do something purposely collective.

6
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,000
I didn't kill Pan Jie.

7
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,720
It was him.

8
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,720
Do you believe it?

9
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,120
I killed them for you.

10
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,160
Just kill him.

11
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,680
You'll never be safe on your way to the love.

12
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,640
No.

13
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,840
Keepık Richard in show London.

14
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,600
Go.

15
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,560
Go.

16
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,400
Go.

17
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,320
What are you doing?

18
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,280
Help me!

19
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,240
Help me!

20
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,080
Help me lead the way.

21
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,360
Dewu!

22
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,680
Chen Jianbin

23
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:23,160
Mears clearly

24
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,680
Old woman is pretending to be a dragon,

25
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,680
delaying time.

26
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,680
Do you need help?

27
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,680
I asked you and you said it.

28
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,680
I said you are expensive.

29
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,680
Anyway, the official who stepped on it will still be executed.

30
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,680
If you meet me and Qi Qing,

31
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,680
I will destroy the capital today.

32
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,680
Don't ruin my official dream.

33
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,680
Qi Qing, go this way.

34
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,680
Don't leave.

35
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,680
Xiao Min, go to the base and kill Guan Meng.

36
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,680
Don't ruin it.

37
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,680
Old woman doesn't care about Guan Meng.

38
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,680
I will fight you on the road of the imperial family.

39
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,680
Let's see who goes to the road of the imperial family first.

40
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,680
Go.

41
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,680
Go.

42
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,680
Go.

43
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,680
Go.

44
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,680
Go.

45
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,680
Go.

46
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,680
Go.

47
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,680
Go.

48
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,680
Go.

49
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,680
Go.

50
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,680
Go.

51
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,680
Go.

52
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,680
Go.

53
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,680
Go.

54
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,680
Go.

55
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,680
Go.

56
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,680
Qi Qi, I don't want to die.

57
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,680
Let go of my brother!

58
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,680
Let him go?

59
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,680
So you can fight again?

60
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,680
If I use my inner power, he will die!

61
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,680
Fu, let's talk it over.

62
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,680
Don't hurt my brother.

63
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,680
Fine.

64
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,680
Let's talk about the Chai family and the Purple-gold Hall first.

65
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,680
We've been friends for over ten years.

66
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,680
This time, you caught Xiao Mi to Yun Shui Village.

67
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,680
For what?

68
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,680
Fu Ni, kill him first.

69
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,680
Don't be so mean.

70
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,680
No man likes her.

71
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,680
When you've asked the right thing,

72
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,680
ask your Ouyang Feng.

73
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,680
Go.

74
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,680
Go.

75
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,680
Go.

76
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,680
Go.

77
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,680
Go.

78
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,680
Go.

79
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,680
Go.

80
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,680
Go.

81
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,680
Go.

82
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,680
Go.

83
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,680
Come.

84
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,680
Go.

85
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,680
Go.

86
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,680
Go.

87
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,680
Go.

88
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,680
Go.

89
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,680
Go.

90
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,680
Go.

91
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,680
Go.

92
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,680
Go.

93
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,680
Go.

94
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,680
Go.

95
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,680
Go.

96
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,680
Go.

97
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,680
Go.

98
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,680
Me Li,

99
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,680
This is too cruel.

100
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,680
We've had 어

101
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,680
I don't have that.

102
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,680
I'm relieved to see you in this state.

103
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,680
What do you mean?

104
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,680
I miss Miss Feng.

105
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,680
I can't let go of her.

106
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,680
If I want to take her away,

107
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,680
I will accompany her to the end of her life.

108
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,680
End of her life?

109
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,680
It's inevitable that one will die in the end.

110
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,680
When one is alive,

111
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,680
we should treat each other kindly.

112
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,680
Thank you, Chief Hu.

113
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,680
Three officials want you to die.

114
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,680
They are wrong.

115
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,680
You are wrong.

116
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,680
They are wrong.

117
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,680
The death penalty is not to be taken.

118
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,680
The death penalty is not to be taken.

119
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,680
If you die, you will die.

120
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,680
Don't hurt my brother.

121
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,680
In the fifth branch of the death penalty,

122
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,680
there is no way to hurt people.

123
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,680
He can't make it clear.

124
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,680
You say it.

125
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,680
The eighth day of the death penalty,

126
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,680
the chief of the court is worried about the death penalty.

127
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,680
Why are you so worried?

128
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,680
It's not a big deal.

129
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,680
I have a few things to tell you.

130
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,680
First,

131
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,680
Yun Shui Village is in danger.

132
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,680
There is a battle going on.

133
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,680
We caught Miss Dan

134
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,680
to tell her to write all the five lines of the Zijing Hall

135
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,680
before the eighth day,

136
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,680
and come to Yun Shui Village to solve them.

137
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,680
At the eighth day,

138
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,680
we solve Hall Leader Dan.

139
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,680
Why does Chief Hai think so?

140
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,680
Miss Dan is the sister of Hall Leader Dan.

141
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,680
Two pearls of the same height in the martial arts circle in the government mansion.

142
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,680
Why did you show mercy to me just now?

143
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,520
I didn't.

144
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,480
If you didn't show mercy on purpose,

145
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,800
I wouldn't have stopped the iron bell.

146
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,960
I can't stand

147
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,600
the six masters of the Chai family.

148
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,480
And you don't want to answer me?

149
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,120
How could you cooperate with the central government?

150
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,240
Elder!

151
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,680
Elder!

152
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,200
Let them go!

153
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,160
Elder!

154
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,000
TheyMen,

155
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,320
this is our last chance.

156
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,600
I can only sit for a while

157
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,640
My brothers are still waiting outside the city

158
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,960
Then have a taste of the food and wine

159
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,240
I won't ask them to prepare the ingredients for you

160
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,320
The wine is ready

161
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,720
Is it delicious?

162
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,480
Yes

163
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,760
The 18-year-old daughter is red

164
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,360
Put the boiling water in a cold pot

165
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,560
Then put the wine in the pot

166
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,480
Drink it in one go

167
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,160
The wine smells good

168
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,840
Did you learn it from the book?

169
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,800
My father always makes wine for me

170
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,400
He likes it

171
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,880
But the wine pot here should be bigger

172
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
The wine will lose a lot of fragrance

173
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,200
Your father is really blessed

174
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,240
It's my blessing

175
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,440
But my father was killed by Hu Qianshou

176
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,840
I am strange

177
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,360
I didn't die

178
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,160
Pu Yuan

179
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,040
Was it you who killed brother Pan?

180
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,760
The Xiyu people

181
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,240
You really believe me

182
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,320
People say it before they die

183
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,080
Why i don't believe you

184
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,380
are done by the règner people.

185
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,800
Why did Ouyang Feng

186
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,240
do such thing?

187
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,360
Because he killed

188
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:45,280
Liu Fang and Tang Long

189
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,200
and he角ed out of sudden when A Boat Man gets to be a toy.

190
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,120
There are just you and I

191
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,240
left on here.

192
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,380
Come here.

193
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,080
I'm sorry.

194
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,080
It seems we're really living in a good time.

195
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,080
Why are you not willing to be here?

196
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,080
People die for money.

197
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,080
Birds die for food.

198
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,080
I just want to live my life better.

199
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,080
I also want to go back to Lin An.

200
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,080
I'm sorry, Yudian.

201
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,080
I'm sorry.

202
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,080
Who is it?

203
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,080
Who is it?

204
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,080
What did he kill?

205
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,080
Stop.

206
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,080
You can blow the incense?

207
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,080
I will.

208
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,080
Can you blow it for me?

209
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,080
Blow it once and then leave.

210
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,080
Okay.

211
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,080
Take off your shoes.

212
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,080
I'll help you clean it up.

213
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,080
Don't use a handkerchief.

214
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,080
That's not good.

215
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,080
A handkerchief is not that good.

216
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,080
I mean,

217
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,080
taking off your shoes is not good.

218
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,080
I fell off the cliff.

219
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,080
It's the first time I see you

220
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,080
and you're helping me to get around the valley.

221
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,080
What's wrong with that?

222
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,080
I did that to thank you for saving me.

223
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,080
How did I save you?

224
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,080
In the Yin Dynasty,

225
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,080
that was the last moment I practiced.

226
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,080
An ordinary villain

227
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,080
could have killed me.

228
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:24,080
But you'd rather be trapped in the cliff

229
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,080
and save me.

230
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,080
I'm sorry.

231
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,080
Who is it?

232
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,080
Where are you going?

233
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,080
Go away.

234
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,080
Don't you know who I am?

235
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,080
I don't care who you are.

236
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,080
Why are you here?

237
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,080
Go.

238
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,080
I'm here to fight.

239
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,080
You're a coward.

240
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,080
Don't move.

241
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,080
Kids, don't move.

242
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,080
It's dangerous.

243
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,080
That's the army of Zhai.

244
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,080
No one can help you.

245
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,080
A handkerchief?

246
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,080
Let go of your hand.

247
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,080
Let go of your hand.

248
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,080
Let go of your hand.

249
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,080
Don't move.

250
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,080
What are you doing here?

251
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,080
I'm going to Jiangzhou

252
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,080
to do something at your Yun Shui Village.

253
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,080
Yun Shui Village is not my hometown.

254
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:49,080
Your Cuihua House is my hometown.

255
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,080
Then why did Mr. Cai Dao come here?

256
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,080
Is Huang Xiaoshi here?

257
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,080
Where is Huang Xiaoshi?

258
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,080
I'm looking for him to fight.

259
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,080
When did Mr. Cai have a fight with Huang Xiaoshi?

260
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,080
Loli Basu.

261
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,080
Where is he?

262
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,080
Inside.

263
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,080
But...

264
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,080
Don't bother him.

265
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,080
I'm going to bother him.

266
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,080
Please.

267
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,080
Please.

268
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,080
Huang Xiaoshi, I'm sure...

269
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,080
Looking for you?

270
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,080
Yes.

271
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,080
Miss Feng, Feng Heng, Mr. Cai.

272
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,080
What are you doing?

273
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,080
Brush your shoes.

274
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,080
I'm going to blow the whistle for him.

275
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,080
I'm going to blow the whistle for him.

276
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,080
I'm going to blow the whistle for him.

277
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,080
Don't move.

278
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,080
Don't move.

279
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,080
Don't move.

280
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,080
Don't move.

281
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,080
Don't move.

282
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,080
Don't move.

283
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,080
I'm going to help you.

284
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,080
Are you going to help me or going out?

285
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,080
Tell me about your secret.

286
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,080
Uncle, you released my brother Tie.

287
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,080
I'm afraid that the Purple-Glutton Hall will be too big

288
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,880
and eat the Chai family.

289
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,320
The Yan Gang

290
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,520
wants the Purple-Glutton Hall and the Chai family to be defeated.

291
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,040
From now on,

292
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,600
the Yan Gang will be the real enemy of the Jianghu.

293
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,120
I'm afraid

294
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,320
that the Purple-Glutton Hall will be too big

295
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,880
and eat the Chai family.

296
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,480
I'm afraid

297
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,560
that the Purple-Glutton Hall will be too big

298
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,920
and eat the Chai family.

299
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,640
I'm afraid

300
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,680
that the Purple-Glutton Hall will be too big

301
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,280
and eat the Chai family.

302
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,120
The Yan Gang is the biggest gang in the Jianghu.

303
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,400
Qi Qing,

304
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,800
what did you say to your own father

305
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,600
about the Yan Gang?

306
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,240
Speaking of this,

307
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,600
Qi Qing will be ashamed to fight against others in the future.

308
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,000
Go to hell!

309
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,520
I know that you are not a good person.

310
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,760
I don't want to do this kind of thing.

311
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,080
You can make requests.

312
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,440
You can make any request.

313
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,000
But you must fight this battle

314
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,200
after you come back from Jiangling.

315
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,320
Mr. Chai,

316
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,920
you have more martial arts skills than me.

317
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,280
Can you count on me?

318
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,280
You are talking nonsense.

319
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,000
No.

320
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,040
But I don't even have shoes.

321
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,280
I give you my shoes.

322
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,960
You run away with your shoes on.

323
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm not as good as you in Qinggong.

324
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,800
You can't even run away with your shoes on.

325
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,400
I'm not as good as you in Qinggong.

326
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,800
But I'm not as good as you in other things.

327
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,560
Can I make any request?

328
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,400
Make any request.

329
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,720
Then make a request.

330
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,400
Say it.

331
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,640
I won't say it now.

332
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,640
If you think about it in the future,

333
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,600
you have to do it.

334
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,200
Ms. Huang,

335
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,800
does she speak for you?

336
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,400
Yes.

337
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,280
Good.

338
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,600
I agree.

339
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,800
Give me the shoes first, okay?

340
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,400
Thank you, Mr. Chai.

341
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,280
No one is allowed to keep the pen.

342
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,640
How about this?

343
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,600
I'll play a song.

344
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,520
If you can hold the pen,

345
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,080
I'll lose.

346
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,240
What do you mean?

347
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,400
The more you play,

348
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,880
the stronger your martial arts are,

349
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,400
and the more you'll be beaten.

350
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,800
If you don't have martial arts,

351
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,720
you won't be affected at all.

352
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,320
You'll only hear the sound of the flute.

353
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,040
You mean you don't have to play the flute,

354
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,680
and you just want to win over me by playing the flute?

355
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:45,800
Good.

356
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,920
Ms. Feng wants to hear it.

357
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,600
You're not in this world.

358
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,080
Okay.

359
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,840
Okay.

360
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,200
leslow

361
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,320
Hey, you big baixu,

362
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:42,960
give me theYes.

363
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,160
Oh my god

364
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:49,840
Hey

365
00:25:49,840 --> 00:26:09,280
welfare

366
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:16,280
drive

367
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,840
Xiaomei, let's go.

368
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,840
Xiaomei, let's go.

369
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,840
Xiaomei, let's go.

370
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,840
Tianmu,

371
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,840
where's our Lady?

372
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,840
Please.

373
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,340
Ouyang Feng.

374
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,140
Take them away.

375
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,040
Go, Miss.

376
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,340
Cui Xiao's dog is a dog.

377
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,540
Father, he is Ouyang Feng.

378
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,340
Xiao Shan is very nice.

379
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,340
What's his name?

380
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,340
Bi Hai Chao Sheng.

381
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,840
Are the new shoes ready?

382
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,840
Have you washed your shoes?

383
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,340
They are clean.

384
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,840
If there is a problem,

385
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,340
if you are lucky,

386
00:32:51,340 --> 00:33:16,260
I can make you a pair of

387
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:20,340
Ouyang brothers.

388
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,340
Yes.

389
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,340
Don't you wear them?

390
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,340
Forget it.

391
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:37,340
I didn't expect there would be such a master.

392
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,340
I have been a wolf for decades.

393
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,340
Say what you want me to do.

394
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:51,340
There is nothing to ask you to do.

395
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,340
You must say it.

396
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,340
Otherwise, how can I live in peace?

397
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,340
If you must say it,

398
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,340
please go back to Jiangling

399
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,340
and Cuihua House

400
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,340
and have fun like before.

401
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,340
I won't go back to Jiangling.

402
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,340
I still owe you.

403
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,340
I can't go back to Cuihua House.

404
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:12,340
Where I go is a joke.

405
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,340
Get out of the way.

406
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,340
Get out of the way.

407
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,340
Get out of the way.

408
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,340
I'm so angry.

409
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,340
Brother.

410
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,340
You are so kind to me.

411
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,340
You still want to go to the battlefield?

412
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:57,340
Go and catch Daming and Furlough.

413
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,340
Wu Jianshou gave me too much money.

414
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,340
No one can resist me.

415
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,340
What do you want?

416
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,340
Brother.

417
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,340
I'll tell you when I get back.

418
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,340
Go.

419
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,340
Go.

420
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,340
Go.

421
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,340
Go.

422
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,340
Go.

423
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,340
Go.

424
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,840
Go.

425
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,840
Go.

426
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,840
Go.

427
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,840
Go.

428
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,840
Go.

429
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,840
Go.

430
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,840
Say it when you get back.

431
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,840
I'm dead.

432
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,840
I'm dead.

433
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,840
You have tried martial arts?

434
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,840
We tried internal force.

435
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,840
I heard the key is gone.

436
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,840
Sorry to bother you.

437
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,840
Without martial arts,

438
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,840
we can only hear the sound.

439
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,840
The deeper the internal force,

440
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,840
the louder the sound.

441
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,840
The assistant director listens.

442
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,840
It doesn't matter.

443
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,840
I'm a useless man.

444
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,840
But it's good.

445
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,840
I enjoy the beautiful music of the key.

446
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,840
Go.

447
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,840
I prepared the new shoes for the key.

448
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,840
No need.

449
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,840
Miss Feng has been cleaned by me.

450
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,840
She has dealt with it well.

451
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,840
Then,

452
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,840
do as the key master wishes.

453
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,840
Go.

454
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,840
Very good.

455
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,840
Very good.

456
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:01,840
I'm glad to see you two getting better.

457
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,840
What's your intention?

458
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,840
As far as I know,

459
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,340
there will be no one

460
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,340
who can surpass the Chai family's martial arts.

461
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:23,340
As long as the key master is done,

462
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,340
he will be convinced.

463
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,340
The martial arts are better than I thought.

464
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,340
Next time he comes,

465
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,340
I will tell him.

466
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,340
Tell him what?

467
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,840
What kind of person are you?

468
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,840
Tell me.

469
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,840
It's better to tell me sooner than later.

470
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,840
Long Live The Frog!

471
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,840
Wait in guarding.

472
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:23,840
I will follow you.

473
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:35,840
Ouyang!

474
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,400
Then you tell me,

475
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,300
What does it say?

476
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,940
Someone tell me!

477
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,960
Someone tell me something!

478
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,540
Yes.

479
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,520
Click on the practice of same.

480
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,680
No pressure.

481
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,560
D Lexi.

482
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,060
Tell us the name of Liu Bu's family head.

483
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,660
I want to know policies of home.

484
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,980
Do you want to watch him?

485
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,540
He'sized.

486
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,680
Can we tell it?

487
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,060
Tell me the reason,

488
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,320
If someone says,

489
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,040
Imapo?

490
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,160
Are you kidding me?

491
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,160
You forced me to go tomorrow

492
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,520
is because I wanted to kill him starts tomorrow

493
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,200
Or I'll be dead

494
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,120
What do you think?

495
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,280
essentially

496
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,440
I bastard

497
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,640
did I kill him

498
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:38,920
That's right

499
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,320
Search!

500
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,320
Yes!

501
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,320
Who are you?

502
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,320
Go away!

503
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,320
The Eight Sites of the Purple and Golden Hall.

504
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,320
The Plain of the Oil and the Oil.

505
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,320
Chief Fang,

506
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,320
the people from the Purple and Golden Hall...

507
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,320
Chief Huo.

508
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,320
Why are you here?

509
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,320
I'm here to see you.

510
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,320
Why are you here?

511
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,320
Leave us.

512
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,320
Yes!

513
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,320
Leave us.

514
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,320
Tell me.

515
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,320
There's someone here.

516
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,320
Tell me.

517
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,320
It's okay.

518
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:30,300
Puyuan can't go back to the

519
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,320
Plain of the Oil and the Oil.

520
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,320
It's okay.

521
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,320
It's okay.

522
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,320
It's okay.

523
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,320
It's okay.

524
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,320
It's okay.

525
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,320
It's okay.

526
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,320
It's okay.

527
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,320
It's okay.

528
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,320
It's okay.

529
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,320
It's okay.

530
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,320
It's okay.

531
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,320
It's okay.

532
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,320
It's okay.

533
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,320
It's okay.

534
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,320
It's okay.

535
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,320
It's okay.

536
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,320
It's okay.

537
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,320
It's okay.

538
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,320
It's okay.

539
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,320
It's okay.

540
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,320
It's okay.

541
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,320
It's okay.

542
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,320
It's okay.

543
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,320
It's okay.

544
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,320
It's okay.

545
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,320
It's okay.

546
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,320
It's okay.

547
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,320
It's okay.

548
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,420
The Lift Chief inלי knows everything.

549
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,220
Where did Ouyangfeng go?

550
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,220
One of Ouyangfeng's men died out in the capital.

551
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,320
He kept chasing me to the capital.

552
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,220
He suddenly summoned the shepherds from the Chen family.

553
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,220
The shepherds wereسم it to really kill him.

554
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,320
Ouyangfeng with the great luck came to us again.

555
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,320
Ouyangfeng is an outsider.

556
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:33,320
Why did you let the foreigners go to Lin'an?

557
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:39,320
I had no other choice but to stay in Yan.

558
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,320
To protect you.

559
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:44,320
You took so much money from me.

560
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,320
Isn't it for the country?

561
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,320
Money is more important than face.

562
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:52,320
When you leave the country,

563
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:56,320
destroy the Zijing Hall and go straight to Wulin,

564
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,320
I will be back to Lin'an soon.

565
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,320
You are in the Zijing Hall,

566
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,320
it's useful.

567
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,320
It's a pity.

568
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,320
I will take care of it.

569
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,320
Shi Qi,

570
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,320
he will listen to you from now on.

571
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,320
Yes.

572
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,320
