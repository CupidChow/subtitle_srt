00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Episode 18

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Stop looking.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's take a nap and have a walk in the morning.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Come on. Let's go to the court.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Now?

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Who is here to interrogate us?

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We don't know.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Why don't you rest in the South Court at this hour?

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You two, stop.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
He is the only one here.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Is the court far away?

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Just in front.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Where is it?

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Wait here.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'll go by myself.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
No.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Come with me.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Don't move.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Don't move.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Follow me.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Come here.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Look here.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Here.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Let's go.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Don't move.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I don't understand.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Come here.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Hurry up.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Taoism Grandmaster

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Who are you?

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Dan Min.

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I mean who are you?

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Who are you?

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The one who came to interrogate you.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Don't move.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
If you feel comfortable sitting there,

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
is it comfortable?

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It must be more comfortable than standing down there.

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Did you kill the three people in the Eight County?

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The official of Guizhou is a woman.

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I ask.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Just answer.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Guizhou

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Guizhou

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Guizhou

47
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's really okay for me to sit here.

48
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's okay.

49
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's okay.

50
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Can I ask you a question?

51
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
No.

52
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
That's not fair.

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I can leave at any time.

54
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Do you think your martial arts are very high?

55
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yes.

56
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
How can you think so?

57
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
White-sleeved Mountain Village's martial arts are unique.

58
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Southern Dynasty's prosperity and peace are not martial arts.

59
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Martial arts are unique.

60
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's almost the same as the Southern Dynasty.

61
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You may not be my opponent.

62
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I don't fight with you.

63
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Because I'm a woman.

64
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I don't fight with women.

65
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I won't fight back even if a woman hits me.

66
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Especially a woman like you.

67
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What kind of woman am I?

68
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Not like a woman.

69
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
To be honest.

70
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Three people were killed by Ba.

71
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:47,120
Two were killed by the eight-sit

72
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
They said it's a reasonable place.

73
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You are Ouyang Feng, right?

74
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yes.

75
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
If you killed him.

76
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Southern Dynasty is your place to die.

77
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Even if you go out of Kuizhou.

78
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Someone will chase you.

79
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Even if you go back to the Western Regions.

80
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Someone will go to the Snow Mountain Village to find you.

81
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
If you can't find it.

82
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You will destroy the Snow Mountain Village.

83
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's not Snow Mountain Village.

84
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's Baituo.

85
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Baituo Mountain Village.

86
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Don't think you are so great.

87
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You haven't seen the people of Song Dynasty.

88
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Forget it.

89
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm not a bastard.

90
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You look down on me.

91
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm not.

92
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You don't talk sense.

93
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You are threatening me.

94
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You killed him.

95
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You are not a bastard.

96
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You are a bastard.

97
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You killed him.

98
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Are you here to make sense?

99
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I...

100
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Ask three questions.

101
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Answer truthfully.

102
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I will judge whether you killed him or not.

103
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I always tell the truth.

104
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What kind of life do you want to live in the past?

105
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
A man walks around.

106
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You just said.

107
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Southern Dynasty is my place to die.

108
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Now you tell me.

109
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I ask, you answer.

110
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
OK.

111
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
When my father was alive,

112
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
one day,

113
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Master Qiu Ci gave me and my brother a bunch of grapes.

114
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I finished it at that time.

115
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's very sweet.

116
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
My brother,

117
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
after counting how many grapes are on it,

118
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
ate one.

119
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Master Qiu Ci said

120
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
how many grapes are on two bunches,

121
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
our life will be a few years.

122
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Now my brother's bunch of grapes are still there.

123
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Eat one every year.

124
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I don't want to live such a life.

125
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I don't want to count my life.

126
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's good to enjoy the sweetness of your life

127
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
for one day.

128
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
If one day you meet someone I like,

129
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
and he likes me,

130
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
it's a bunch of grapes.

131
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
One day together is a lifetime.

132
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
This is the life I want.

133
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Truth.

134
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Truth.

135
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Truth.

136
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Truth.

137
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Truth.

138
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Truth.

139
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Truth.

140
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Truth.

141
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Truth.

142
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Truth.

143
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Truth.

144
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Truth.

145
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Truth.

146
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Truth.

147
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Truth.

148
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Truth.

149
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Truth.

150
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Truth.

151
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Truth.

152
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Truth.

153
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Truth.

154
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Truth.

155
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Truth.

156
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Truth.

157
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Truth.

158
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Truth.

159
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Truth.

160
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Truth.

161
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Truth.

162
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Truth.

163
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Truth.

164
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Truth.

165
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Truth.

166
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Truth.

167
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Truth.

168
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Truth.

169
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Truth.

170
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Truth.

171
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Truth.

172
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Truth.

173
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Truth.

174
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:08,980
Being attached to you

175
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,080
in this world

176
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
is truly happiness.

177
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,600
One day

178
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,800
Jin Tang, the son of Lin An

179
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,800
Pan Jie, the son of Mu

180
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,600
Pu Yuan, the son of Liu

181
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,360
Yu Dian, the son of Zhu

182
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,920
Tang Long, the son of Shi

183
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,600
Liu Fang, the son of Ding Jiao

184
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,440
What the hell?

185
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,920
Don't be so polite

186
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,600
Liu Tianshui, the son of Yu

187
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,640
Liu Baogen, the son of Bi

188
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,520
They are dead in Ba County

189
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,000
We are here for this

190
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,440
Go back to prison

191
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,680
Don't die

192
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,400
You should tell this to yourself

193
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,840
Where is our young master?

194
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,600
Can you tell me?

195
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,400
He is in the front court

196
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,000
He is talking to my lady

197
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,280
Go back

198
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,680
We don't want to go back

199
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,800
We can sit here and wait for him

200
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,400
What do you think?

201
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,880
We can sit here and wait for him

202
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,640
What do you think?

203
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,280
Ouyang Fang

204
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,200
Ouyang Fang

205
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,920
Do you feel comfortable standing there?

206
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,280
Yes

207
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,440
Then don't move

208
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,960
What kind of person do you want to meet?

209
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,680
Gentle and affectionate

210
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,400
Like a girl from the Southern Dynasty

211
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,480
She can sing the lyrics of Liu Zanbian

212
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,400
Like a painting

213
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,760
What are you thinking?

214
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,160
What kind of person is in the painting?

215
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,320
In the painting

216
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:25,800
Oh, no

217
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,600
My luggage was left in the restaurant where I fought in the daytime

218
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,000
You are from the government

219
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,960
Can you help me get my luggage back?

220
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,680
There is an important painting in it

221
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,600
Stand back

222
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,440
Is Hua Zheng a woman?

223
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,000
Yes

224
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,360
You saw it?

225
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,040
No

226
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,560
Then I am leaving

227
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,520
I didn't kill her

228
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,240
Believe it or not, you can do it

229
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,800
I haven't finished asking three questions

230
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,480
You have finished

231
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,480
Three questions

232
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,440
Where are three questions?

233
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,760
What kind of life do you want to live?

234
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,240
What kind of person do you want to meet?

235
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,480
Is Hua Zheng a woman?

236
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,280
You didn't kill her

237
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,560
You can't leave

238
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,120
Why?

239
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,840
No reason

240
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,840
What do you want?

241
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,200
I can do whatever I want

242
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,720
To be honest

243
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,840
I hate you the most

244
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,080
You are unreasonable

245
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,520
I am here to kill you today

246
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,560
Don't blame me

247
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,800
No

248
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,040
I don't want to talk to you

249
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,960
Ouyang Fang

250
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,960
No one dares to talk to me like this

251
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,440
You are dead

252
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,000
I will kill you later

253
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,880
Why do you wait?

254
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,400
Brother

255
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,400
Oh my god

256
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,840
Brother

257
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,360
Close it

258
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:44,960
Steady

259
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,520
Captain

260
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,080
Do youload

261
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,400
It's done

262
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,160
No.

263
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,080
How dare you hit me?

264
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,760
I didn't mean to.

265
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,760
I didn't expect your kung fu to be so good.

266
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,280
You haven't seen the good ones.

267
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,760
I only used three.

268
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,280
Fifty percent of my power.

269
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,240
Not even one percent.

270
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,400
No.

271
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,720
Is it necessary?

272
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,400
I told you.

273
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,200
I didn't kill him.

274
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,920
Why did you do that?

275
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,480
You can't escape.

276
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,120
I'll find you no matter what.

277
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,480
You're ridiculous.

278
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,600
Come back.

279
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:18,920
Brother Lian.

280
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,760
Brother Lian.

281
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,840
It's weird.

282
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,080
My inner power is like being torn apart.

283
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,000
I'm really being pulled away.

284
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,840
Young Master.

285
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,240
What's going on?

286
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:50,960
Young Master.

287
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,800
The people of the Forbidden City are tough.

288
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:54,640
Let's go.

289
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:01,840
Go.

290
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,360
Go.

291
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,080
Your luggage is lost.

292
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,920
Did you check it out?

293
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,360
Did they really kill Nian Yu and Bi Dao?

294
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,320
Call all the five banks to come here.

295
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,560
The five bank elders are not together.

296
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,880
Call whoever you want.

297
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,320
Should we tell the Hall Leader first?

298
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:32,720
No.

299
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,400
He's here.

300
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,640
Ouyang Feng.

301
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,840
No one is allowed to move.

302
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,800
I'll go to him in person.

303
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,160
Brother Lian.

304
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,440
Open the door.

305
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,960
We lost a luggage here.

306
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,320
It's getting cold.

307
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,320
It's getting cold.

308
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,720
What did you say?

309
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,040
Just open the door.

310
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:57,600
Brother Lian.

311
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,680
It's getting cold.

312
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,040
It's getting cold.

313
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,000
Brother Lian.

314
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,840
Brother Lian.

315
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,280
It's a man named Pan Jie.

316
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,680
When Brother Lian was fighting with him,

317
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,600
his internal force was destroyed by him.

318
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,840
Nan Zhao is really a master.

319
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,120
No matter how good his martial arts are, he's no match for Young Master.

320
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,600
Go back to the government office.

321
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,120
Kill them all.

322
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,440
Revenge for Li Gou.

323
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,080
Go.

324
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:47,760
Go.

325
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,320
Go.

326
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:48,920
Go.

327
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,480
Go.

328
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,080
Go.

329
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,640
Go.

330
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,120
Go.

331
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:51,720
Go.

332
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,360
Go.

333
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:52,920
Go.

334
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,440
Go.

335
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:53,920
Go.

336
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,480
Go.

337
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,040
Go.

338
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,720
Go.

339
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,200
Go.

340
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:56,800
Go.

341
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,600
Go.

342
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,040
Go.

343
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,640
Go.

344
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,200
Go.

345
00:19:59,200 --> 00:19:59,880
Go.

346
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,560
Go.

347
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,640
Revenge for Li Gou.

348
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,800
I left a luggage in the boat.

349
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,680
Did you see it?

350
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,520
The...

351
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,480
The eye patch is broken.

352
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,280
Where did it go?

353
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,520
Young Master.

354
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,640
Go back to the government office.

355
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,520
It's no use to go to Lin'an again.

356
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,760
Miss Liu Ru Si can't see that painting.

357
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,960
She won't recognize the white rabbit manor.

358
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,600
Go back to the government office.

359
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,040
Kill all the people in the Forbidden City.

360
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,400
Let's bury Li Gou first.

361
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:31,720
Go.

362
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,480
Go.

363
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,520
Go.

364
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,280
Light it.

365
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,080
Fighting.

366
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,280
Fighting.

367
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,760
fighting.

368
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,480
Fighting.

369
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,920
Fighting.

370
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,000
Fighting.

371
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
What else do you want?

372
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
What else?

373
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Young Master is dead

374
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Ten years, a hundred years

375
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
People will die eventually

376
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm sorry

377
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
The body is in the car

378
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
The body is in the car?

379
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Send it back to the chief

380
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Go

381
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Why are you standing here?

382
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Waiting for someone

383
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Not us?

384
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
No

385
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
You can go

386
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Killing Young Master of Yan Gang is a bigger deal

387
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
People will chase you wherever you go

388
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
How about this?

389
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I apologize

390
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
What's your name?

391
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Hu Baili

392
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Hu Baili

393
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Hu Baili

394
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
We met by chance

395
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
We parted ways

396
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Life and death are in the heaven

397
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
in the heaven

398
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Don't blame me

399
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Go

400
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Go

401
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Young Master

402
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
bury Liege here

403
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
It's not convenient to carry him on the road

404
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Go back to the government office

405
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Use this knife to kill all the people of the Forbidden City

406
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Now the people who go to Kuizhou government office are gone

407
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
They are all officers and soldiers in the daytime

408
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
What should we do?

409
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I want to go to Lin'an

410
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I'll tell Liu Shisi the source of the story

411
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
He will listen to it

412
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Painting is Miss Liu's gift

413
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
How can she go back to the White-Haired Manor without seeing the painting?

414
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
How can she tell her brother without seeing Liu Shisi?

415
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Sister Dian, you and I will go together

416
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Don't follow others

417
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Miss

418
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Miss

419
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Miss

420
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Did they really kill the Forbidden City?

421
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Yes

422
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Everyone follows

423
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Miss is willful

424
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
No one can afford it if something happens

425
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Let's go

426
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Come

427
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
What's wrong?

428
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I'll go back to the Forbidden City after I go back

429
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Ok

430
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Go

431
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Say it first

432
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
It has nothing to do with me

433
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Just ask

434
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Ask what?

435
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Where are you taking me?

436
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Who?

437
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
The one in the car

438
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
The chief of the Jiangling

439
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Why is he with you?

440
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Is it interesting to play with us?

441
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
If you want to kill me, you should be more painful

442
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
What do you mean?

443
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
What do you want?

444
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I just said

445
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Just ask

446
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Why is that girl in your car?

447
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Is it related to you?

448
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
No

449
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Then let us go

450
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Can't she move?

451
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
She…

452
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
No

453
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Can she talk?

454
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Yes

455
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Why did you take her to Jiangling?

456
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Young chief

457
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
She was filial before she died

458
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
She took her back from Banshan

459
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
She was still alive

460
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
She was sent to you

461
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
It's a simple help

462
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Maybe it can cure her

463
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Go

464
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Go

465
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Is Liang Zicui enough?

466
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Enough

467
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Dr. Jiu

468
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
You are welcome

469
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Two coins

470
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Two coins

471
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Liang Zicui is a soldier

472
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Two coins

473
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
No money

474
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
It's the government's business

475
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I'm sorry

476
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Sister-in-law

477
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Go

478
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Go

479
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Oh my god

480
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I want to talk to her

481
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Go

482
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I won't move

483
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Go

484
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
What's your name?

485
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
No need to know

486
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I want to know

487
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Why?

488
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I want to get familiar with you

489
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Why do you think of me?

490
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I've been with my father since I was a child

491
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I didn't have any acquaintance

492
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
When I saw you

493
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
He died

494
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
You saved me

495
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Why can't I move?

496
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
The pill can't keep people alive

497
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
But I can give you a bone

498
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
You'll be fine in an hour

499
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I ran away in an hour

500
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Are you so impatient?

501
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
He killed me

502
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
He killed my father

503
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I

504
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I don't want to know your past

505
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Can you take me away?

506
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
How?

507
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I can wash clothes, cook

508
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And cook well

509
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
As long as I follow you

510
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I can't take you away

511
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Many years

512
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Many years

513
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I'm alone

514
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I'm strange

515
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I don't talk to people for a year or two

516
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Sometimes I go with someone

517
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
It's two months

518
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
If it's boring, I'll leave

519
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I'm sorry

520
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,000
It's too troublesome to take you away

521
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Close your eyes

522
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
There is a long and a short life

523
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
But it's up to the fate

524
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Don't blame me

525
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
You said it on the way

526
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I'll give you another bone

527
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
The charm has turned into a silver bullet

528
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
You go your way, I go mine

529
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Your face is bleeding

530
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Thief

531
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Kill me

532
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Because I don't take you away

533
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Because I'm yours

534
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
You don't want me

535
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
How can I live in the world with my face?

536
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Mine?

537
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,000
No one has ever touched my body

538
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
It's wrong to save you

539
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Is the pill worth it?

540
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Not worth it

541
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I'm sorry

542
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
You go

543
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I don't know if Jiang Lin can move

544
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
What's your name?

545
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Huang Yaoshi

546
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Thank you

547
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I shouldn't have said that

548
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I'm glad I know it

549
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
What's your name?

550
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
You don't need to know

551
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
You don't want to either

552
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Yes

553
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Can you help me?

554
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
What?

555
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I can't move

556
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I don't want to be with the dead on this road

557
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I'm sorry

558
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
You're still here

559
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I'll kill you

560
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I can't even get the money

561
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
It's a shame

562
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:32,320
Two

563
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I want to get a penny from your luggage

564
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
It's okay

565
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
What's okay?

566
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Nothing

567
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Two catties of wine and one cattie of beef

568
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Mr. Lei

569
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I'm not the kind of person you think I am

570
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I'm not a man

571
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I'm a man

572
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I'm a man

573
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I'm a man

574
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I'm a man

575
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Mr. Lei

576
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I'm not the kind of person you think I am

577
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
You're the kind of person I am

578
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I'll let go of the fire if you kill someone

579
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
You can eat meat if I drink

580
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
You can turn around

581
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
You're my brother

582
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I'm your brother

583
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Ouyang

584
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Ouyang Feng

585
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Ouyang

586
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
From now on, I'll accompany you wherever you go

587
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Your business is my business

588
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I have something to tell you

589
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I buried a brother today

590
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I'm going to be punished

591
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Do you want to drink?

592
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Young Master

593
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
He doesn't know the bottom line

594
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
The Chief Officer Guo entered the Southern Dynasty

595
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Who knows the bottom line?

596
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
A man should be brave and brave

597
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
If you grab too much trouble

598
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Yes

599
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
If you don't mind

600
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
tell me what's on your mind

601
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Sit

602
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
It's the best to talk about your feelings after drinking

603
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
What did he say?

604
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
He said

605
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
What did he say?

606
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
He said he would kill me

607
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
What?

608
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Kill you?

609
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
He wanted me to kill him

610
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
He said he was mine

611
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I don't want him

612
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I don't have the face to live in this world

613
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Did Brother Yao hear it wrong?

614
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
You don't even know his name

615
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
We met each other in the water

616
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
We met twice

617
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Brother Yao is moved

618
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I don't have the heart

619
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
So you mean

620
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
your heart has been taken away by him

621
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Impossible

622
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
No one in this world understands me

623
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
You are too emotional

624
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Emotional and emotional

625
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
You can't turn around forever

626
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
or come out

627
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
You are like a dead man

628
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I went to your Western Regions

629
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
It's a vast land

630
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
It's rare to see a few people

631
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
after a few hundred miles

632
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Once you meet

633
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
you will be so close

634
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
It's rare to see

635
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
someone as delicate and emotional as Brother Ouyang

636
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
There was a Western Region man

637
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
He was rich

638
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
had many disciples and wives

639
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
He had two sons

640
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
He was a good man

641
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
He had many wives and wives

642
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
He had two sons

643
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
The eldest son was smart and cautious

644
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
The mother was a good woman

645
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
The youngest son was smart too

646
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
The mother was the concubine

647
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
that the Southern Regions married

648
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
She was loved by all

649
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
But the Western Regions died

650
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
The Southern Regions took their son

651
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
to the farthest place

652
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
and suffered the most

653
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
They went to another man

654
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
The youngest son realized

655
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
that the man was his father

656
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
The concubine and the man

657
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
had only been together for three days

658
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
but they missed each other for more than ten years

659
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
But the man was afraid of

660
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
the Western Regions with many disciples

661
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
He didn't want to take in the concubine and the son

662
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
The concubine killed the man

663
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Then she took the son

664
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
to the farthest place

665
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
and suffered the most

666
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
and went back to the Western Regions with many disciples

667
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
She entrusted the son to the eldest son

668
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Then the concubine committed suicide

669
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
She said

670
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
if she couldn't be with the man

671
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
she would go to the Yellow Spring

672
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
to meet his luck

673
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
The eldest son or the youngest son?

674
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
You

675
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
The youngest son

676
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
You are nice to me

677
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
But when I grow up

678
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I want to visit the Southern Regions

679
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
You should visit

680
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
the woman who makes you upset

681
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Forget it

682
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
There are so many poor people in this world

683
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Let's meet again

684
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
At least you know her name

685
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
What if I know her name?

686
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
You will get used to her when you think of her

687
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
It's better than thinking of a stranger

688
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
You are a good man

689
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I know you

690
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
You are better than thinking of a stranger

691
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Four

692
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Seven

693
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Put Young Master in the carriage

694
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
If the monster doesn't come

695
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
will he go back to the General of the Jiangling?

696
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Will he let the young master

697
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
see him going back like this?

698
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
This

699
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Siqi

700
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
The young master is working in the Kuizu

701
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
When we get to the Jiangling

702
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
will the old master kill us?

703
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Yes

704
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I don't want to go back

705
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Who else doesn't want to go back?

706
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Who else?

707
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Young Master

708
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Put him back in the carriage

709
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Dongzhao

710
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Siqi

711
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Go back to the station

712
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
and watch the Western Regions and the monster

713
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
where they are

714
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
and protect the General

715
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Brother Ouyang

716
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
You don't have to pay me

717
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
for the journey

718
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I don't have the money

719
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Just leave me alone

720
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Mine is yours

721
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
There are more than ten gold coins in the luggage

722
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Let's use them together

723
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Is that painting very precious?

724
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Have you opened it?

725
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
No

726
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
When the people of the Yan Gang opened it in Kuizhou

727
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I didn't see it

728
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I didn't see it

729
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
When the people of the Yan Gang opened it

730
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I just saw it

731
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
The painter's name is Liu Ruisi

732
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
This trip to Lin'an Prefecture

733
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
is to take him back to the Western Regions

734
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
You want to marry him?

735
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
If my brother wants to marry

736
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
then he can marry my sister-in-law

737
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
It's not the time

738
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Sister Yan

739
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Do I look good?

740
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Am I not like a woman?

741
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
You are the most beautiful woman in the world

742
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
But it doesn't matter if you look like a woman

743
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Why?

744
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
It's up to you to decide if you look good

745
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
It's up to you to decide if you look like a woman

746
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Men are unreliable

747
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
When they like you, they say you are beautiful

748
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
When they don't like you

749
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
it's useless to look good

750
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Isn't that great?

751
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
If they happen to meet someone you like

752
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
but they don't care about you

753
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
then they will hate you

754
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
If you hate him, kill him

755
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
It's useless to kill him

756
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
but I still hate him

757
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
He's dead, what's there to hate?

758
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Hate yourself

759
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I'm not as good as a lotus

760
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I'm a little bit of a mess

761
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I'm a little bit of a mess

762
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I'm a little bit of a mess

763
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I'm a little bit of a mess

764
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I'm a little bit of a mess

765
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I'm a little bit of a mess

766
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I'm a little bit of a mess

767
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I'm a little bit of a mess

768
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I'm a little bit of a mess

769
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I'm a little bit of a mess

770
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I'm a little bit of a mess

771
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I'm a little bit of a mess

772
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I'm a little bit of a mess

773
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I'm a little bit of a mess

774
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
I'm a little bit of a mess

775
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I'm a little bit of a mess

776
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
I'm a little bit of a mess

777
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I'm a little bit of a mess

778
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I'm a little bit of a mess

779
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I'm a little bit of a mess

780
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I'm a little bit of a mess

781
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:24,000
The wind blows, the flowers bloom

782
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
The night is like a poem

783
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
The clouds are like the wind, the leaves are like the wind

784
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Where is the flower of this life?

785
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,000
No end, no half, the sky is yellow

786
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I step by step, I look for the flower of this life

787
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Half a life, the sky is gray

788
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I have never been in love, I am like a knife in the wind

789
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I will not let

790
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I am a love song, the ground is cold

791
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I don't know if this is a good or bad

792
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:16,000
I am helpless, I have never been in love, I am like a knife in the wind

793
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:36,000
A word is a flower, the sky is green, the autumn is like a wall

794
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Who does the world think is true?

795
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
It's just that it belongs to the past

796
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I don't know how the heaven and earth are separated

797
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,000
It's unforgettable at this moment

798
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,000
The dust has been washed away, the thousand farewells have been left

799
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I can't help it

800
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
