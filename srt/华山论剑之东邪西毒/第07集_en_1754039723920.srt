1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,900
The Taoism CPU

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:03,900
Episode twelve

3
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,200
Father!

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,840
Agent Xiao!

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,160
I'll get enough rest

6
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,760
and heal my wound.

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,560
They'll return to the court

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,680
after a short journey.

9
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,240
My Lady,

10
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,040
Ouyang Fang killed Liu Fang and Tang Long.

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,400
I'll avenge him.

12
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,600
Come back.

13
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,120
Are you his opponents?

14
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,600
Don't cause any trouble.

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,800
There's a temple under the forest.

16
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,760
Go and heal your wound.

17
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,200
Where's Puyuan?

18
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,720
Brother Pan was killed by Puyuan.

19
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,560
He chased me to Pengze City.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,360
If Ouyang Fang hadn't done it,

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,960
I would have died in Puyuan's hands.

22
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,320
I heard that специally,

23
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,940
the

24
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,760
king sent people

25
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,920
to save Puyuan.

26
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,560
But their clothes were gone

27
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,520
since they moved to Pengze City.

28
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,360
So they constitutional

29
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,860
soldiers

30
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,960
the chief of panel

31
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,100
regarding the capital.

32
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,720
The court kept a secret

33
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:54,000
for three days before

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,440
the assassination.

35
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,240
And it's Nicole's

36
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,840
Who are the two people who are Liu Fang and Tang Long?

37
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,560
I don't know.

38
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,880
But Brother Yao came here.

39
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,760
He buried them.

40
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,840
Are you going to stand there forever?

41
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,400
I killed them.

42
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,200
Although they said they were friends in Jiangling,

43
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,600
they are not now.

44
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,160
I won't fight back if you want to kill me.

45
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,120
Fu Yi is building a temple down there.

46
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,440
If you can't kill yourself,

47
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,080
let him do it.

48
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,760
I'll leave if you don't do it.

49
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:49,960
Ouyang Fang.

50
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,120
You have to stay with us.

51
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,680
At least for today,

52
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,080
I can't kill myself.

53
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,040
Why?

54
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,840
Fu Yi is injured.

55
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,360
If he can't hold himself back,

56
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,520
I and Yu Dian need your protection.

57
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,240
Protect you?

58
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,400
Among us four,

59
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,840
you have the highest martial arts.

60
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,640
Fu Yi is injured because of you.

61
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,400
I'm begging you.

62
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,260
Go.

63
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,200
Be quick.

64
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:38,760
Only Bolong

65
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,440
Team B and Master Wu

66
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:51,980
can

67
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,440
You have to wait for the aroma of the three seasons before getting on the carriage

68
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,240
I don't like that taste

69
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,560
Maybe it's too sweet

70
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,400
Stop

71
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,440
Chief

72
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,440
What's going on?

73
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,440
The imperial teacher is standing in front of us

74
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,440
He won't come over

75
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,440
Go over there

76
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,440
Don't move

77
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,440
Yes

78
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,440
Move

79
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,440
Chief

80
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,440
You are here

81
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,440
I'm here to talk with the guardian

82
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,440
What's the matter?

83
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:24,440
What's wrong with Ouyang Feng?

84
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,440
How should I know?

85
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,440
Isn't he with you?

86
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,440
Cai Kezhen, I heard everything

87
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,440
If Ouyang Feng's life is at stake

88
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,440
It's related to you

89
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,440
I have to be polite to the chief

90
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,440
The rest of them will die

91
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,440
Chief

92
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,440
The business of the Yan Gang is complicated

93
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,440
I have to take care of tens of thousands of brothers' livelihoods

94
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,440
There is a lot of conflict in the world

95
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,440
Ouyang Feng has been with the people of the Chai family and the Zijintang

96
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,440
I just want to hear from the friends below

97
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,440
I just want to know

98
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,440
How is his life related to me?

99
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,440
I haven't even seen him

100
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,440
Chief, you are telling the truth

101
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,440
Do you know who I am?

102
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,440
He doesn't know anything

103
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,440
Miss Feng has a guard against me

104
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,440
Your father died, my son died

105
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,440
I told you

106
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,440
We are even

107
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,440
Do you want to hear from me?

108
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,440
Yes

109
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,440
There are two kinds of people in the world

110
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,440
One is good-natured

111
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,440
One is evil

112
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,440
The chief is a man of no desire

113
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,440
How can he stir up the war between the five forests and the forest to fight against the family?

114
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,440
His own son died and he had a grudge against him

115
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,440
But he killed thousands of people for money

116
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,440
Is it clear?

117
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,440
Kill people?

118
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,440
For money?

119
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,440
When did I kill people?

120
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,440
My father lost your private life in Huainanxi

121
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,440
You chased him to kill people in Bashan

122
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,440
The Yan Gang is rich and can be the enemy

123
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,440
Isn't the life of his own son more important than thousands of gold and private life?

124
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,440
I have a pretext

125
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,440
I have told the pharmacist

126
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,440
What is it?

127
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,440
I want to borrow the pharmacist's hand

128
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,440
to create my body

129
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,440
and walk freely

130
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,440
Ok

131
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,440
Thank you, chief

132
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,440
for detoxifying Miss Feng

133
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,440
I will make another bone for you

134
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,440
After that, Miss Feng and I will leave

135
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,440
pharmacist

136
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,440
You said

137
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,440
you would take the elixir 21 days after the bone is made

138
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,440
to be normal

139
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,440
There are five more days after today

140
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,440
I will leave nine times of Yinlun Elixir for you

141
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,440
It will be good for you if you take it 21 days later

142
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,440
But Miss Feng and I will not come back

143
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,440
after we leave

144
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,440
Do you want to go up and have a look?

145
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,440
Yes

146
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,440
Take a deep breath

147
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,440
Take a deep breath

148
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,440
Take a deep breath

149
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,440
The key is to take the elixir

150
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,440
Go

151
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,440
I want to thank you

152
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,440
Miss Feng is young

153
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,440
and experienced

154
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,440
She is a snowman

155
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,440
She is a snowman

156
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,440
She is a snowman

157
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,440
She is a snowman

158
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,440
She is a snowman

159
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,440
She is a snowman

160
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,440
She is a snowman

161
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,440
She is a snowman

162
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,440
She is a snowman

163
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,440
She is a snowman

164
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,440
She is a snowman

165
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,440
You are so smart

166
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,440
I really can't imagine

167
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,440
Three days of soul loss.

168
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,440
Three days of anxiety every day.

169
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,440
When the soul is lost,

170
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,440
four hours in advance.

171
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,440
The day before was a bad day.

172
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,440
Today is a good day.

173
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,440
Didn't you just get married?

174
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,440
How can we get married?

175
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,440
The powder just now

176
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,440
was a good day.

177
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,440
The scent of the butterfly

178
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,440
is the real three-day soul loss.

179
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,440
Your martial arts skills are extraordinary.

180
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,440
But only Miss Feng can hold you back.

181
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,440
The heaven knows you.

182
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,440
Feng Heng,

183
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,440
when the time comes,

184
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,440
you will be dead.

185
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,440
I'm so sincere to you.

186
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,440
You actually...

187
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,440
How can there be someone like you

188
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,440
who is so pure and honest?

189
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,440
I, Hu Qianshu,

190
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,440
have been practicing martial arts for a long time.

191
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,440
My body is disabled.

192
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,440
If I can't do anything,

193
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,440
how can I live until today?

194
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,440
The martial arts world is so vast.

195
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,440
I don't even need to mention it again.

196
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,440
Are you going to kill me?

197
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,440
A master of the world,

198
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,440
trapped by a woman,

199
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,440
I know you wouldn't dare.

200
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,440
Let's go.

201
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,440
Go.

202
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,440
Master.

203
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,440
They will come back

204
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,440
before the time comes.

205
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,440
Master.

206
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,440
Ouyang Feng,

207
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,440
why did you listen to him and stay here?

208
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,440
I'll leave

209
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,440
after you recover your inner power.

210
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,440
It's really strange.

211
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,440
I recover,

212
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,440
and you can't leave.

213
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,440
You're not able to leave

214
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,440
before the time comes.

215
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,440
You saved me from the iron tomb.

216
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,440
I stayed to let them come back.

217
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,440
It makes sense.

218
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,440
What is Yu Dian doing?

219
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,440
Dig a hole.

220
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,440
Wait until the night is over and bury him.

221
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,440
Did you hear that?

222
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,440
He heard it.

223
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,440
Ouyang Feng, if I were you,

224
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,440
I would kill Fu Yi and me now.

225
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,440
What do you mean?

226
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,440
You're the one who asked me to come back.

227
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,440
You're talking nonsense again.

228
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,440
I won't say it anymore.

229
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,440
I killed you two.

230
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,440
I avenged Lie and Zhao.

231
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,440
I'll stay here for one more day.

232
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,440
If the Chai family comes,

233
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,440
I'll kill them.

234
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,440
If they don't come,

235
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,440
I won't see them again.

236
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,440
You won't see them again?

237
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,440
Yes.

238
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,440
I don't see them anymore.

239
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,440
If you feel upset,

240
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,440
do what you want to do.

241
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,440
No wonder I like you.

242
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,440
Don't say that.

243
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,440
In the world,

244
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,440
whether you owe someone or not,

245
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,440
is not something that can be said clearly.

246
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,440
As long as it makes sense,

247
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,440
everything can be said clearly.

248
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,440
Come, let's go out and talk.

249
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,440
Let's talk.

250
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,440
I'll wait outside.

251
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,440
I don't believe you won't come out.

252
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,440
In the battle of Kuizhou,

253
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,440
you said that

254
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,440
I touched your body

255
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,440
and I had no face to live in this world.

256
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,440
I don't believe you.

257
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,440
If you want to live in this world,

258
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,440
I should take you away at that time.

259
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,440
Actually, I just want you to take me away.

260
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,440
I never thought you would take me away for a lifetime.

261
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,440
I want to be with you forever.

262
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,440
It's almost time.

263
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,440
Go back.

264
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,440
Chief Hu will detoxify the poison for you.

265
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,440
What if he doesn't?

266
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,440
Kill Jin Yanbao.

267
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,440
I'm a person who doesn't know the world.

268
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,440
I'm in the trouble of the world.

269
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,440
It's good to make people feel the same.

270
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,440
You said that the nine-channel yin-loon-dan is poisonous.

271
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,440
Even if I can't live for a long time,

272
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,440
how long can I live?

273
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,440
Three or five years.

274
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,440
In that year,

275
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,440
you were in the seclusion for half a year.

276
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,440
Why?

277
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,440
We met in the cliff.

278
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,440
We parted in the cliff.

279
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,440
We didn't know each other.

280
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,440
I'm just a leaf in the wind.

281
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,440
It's easy to forget.

282
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,440
I'm just a leaf in the wind.

283
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,440
It's easy to forget.

284
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,440
I'm just a leaf in the wind.

285
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,440
It's easy to forget.

286
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,440
I'm just a leaf in the wind.

287
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,440
It's easy to forget.

288
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,440
I'm just a leaf in the wind.

289
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,440
It's easy to forget.

290
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,440
I'm just a leaf in the wind.

291
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,440
It's easy to forget.

292
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,440
I'm just a leaf in the wind.

293
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,440
It's easy to forget.

294
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,440
I'm just a leaf in the wind.

295
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,440
It's easy to forget.

296
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,440
I'm just a leaf in the wind.

297
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,440
It's easy to forget.

298
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,440
I'm just a leaf in the wind.

299
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,440
It's easy to forget.

300
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,440
I'm just a leaf in the wind.

301
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,440
It's easy to forget.

302
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,440
I'm just a leaf in the wind.

303
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,440
It's easy to forget.

304
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,440
I'm just a leaf in the wind.

305
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,440
It's easy to forget.

306
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,440
I'm just a leaf in the wind.

307
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,440
It's easy to forget.

308
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,440
I'm just a leaf in the wind.

309
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,440
It's easy to forget.

310
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:28,740
Einar

311
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,640
Who are you?

312
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,520
Who are you?

313
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,040
You?

314
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,000
Why did you talk to me like that?

315
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,720
You gave the order.

316
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,640
Just let me know.

317
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,080
I've dug out the pit.

318
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,240
I'll bury you away when Fu słui comes.

319
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,400
You killed Bazuo and others.

320
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:35,920
Event at the Cang ai promised you

321
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,160
nothing to do in digger this place.

322
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,200
Say that again.

323
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,000
There's no place.

324
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,520
İn Kaybu.

325
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:44,580
Prefer Shang miraculous Até dixi

326
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,880
as Náshi.

327
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,440
Why didn't you leave?

328
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,520
Your father saved me in the city

329
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,040
and blocked me again.

330
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,240
I'm here to help the Chai family.

331
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,280
I came back to coax you.

332
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,280
It makes sense.

333
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,720
Ouyang Fang bought this pit for you.

334
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,280
You think I'm stupid?

335
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,040
You can buy it.

336
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,480
You're no match for him when he comes out.

337
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,920
I won't fight with a woman.

338
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,560
I won't fight with a woman.

339
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,280
Because I'm a woman?

340
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,680
I won't fight with a woman.

341
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,240
I won't fight back even if you hit me.

342
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,120
Then you'll die here tonight.

343
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,000
A man's death is more important than his life.

344
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,640
I think I'm invincible.

345
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,680
I realized these days

346
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,120
that I'm nothing.

347
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,840
There's only a truth in being a man.

348
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,520
If you don't keep it,

349
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,840
you won't deserve to die.

350
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,960
Let's go back to the Western Regions, okay?

351
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,800
I don't want to stay in the Song Dynasty.

352
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,840
We're together.

353
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,880
I don't care about any grudges.

354
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,440
I've been with Liu Fang for more than ten years.

355
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,520
I have no reason to let him go

356
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,480
because of your personal feelings.

357
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,120
Ouyang Feng.

358
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,280
When Jiang Lin said we're friends,

359
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,720
I stabbed you twice.

360
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,480
Ouyang Feng has a sharp tongue.

361
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,160
At most,

362
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,400
don't use death to force me.

363
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,120
I don't want you to die here

364
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,280
after two stabs.

365
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,440
Who's the woman in the painting?

366
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,800
It has nothing to do with you.

367
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,200
I see.

368
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,520
I'm so annoyed by your indecisiveness.

369
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,400
I'll make the decision.

370
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,320
I'll be the one to make the decision.

371
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,360
I'll be the one to make the decision.

372
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,240
If you and Xiao Min

373
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,480
go back to the Western Regions,

374
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,360
never come to the Song Dynasty again.

375
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,960
If you don't obey me,

376
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,400
the two tribes of the Golden Hall

377
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,840
will be punished for nothing.

378
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,080
What if I die?

379
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,960
That's the way to be.

380
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,280
It's not clear.

381
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,480
You don't want to reason with me?

382
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,080
You've already made a good reason.

383
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,440
There's no reason to argue in this world.

384
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,360
I just want to go to Lin'ai.

385
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,000
I didn't mean to offend your South Regions' martial arts.

386
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,640
I, Ouyang Feng, will never give up my martial arts.

387
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,560
Xiao Min, are you crazy?

388
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,560
I'm not crazy.

389
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,280
Ouyang Feng, leave now.

390
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,000
Miss, I've served you for more than ten years.

391
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,880
You've only met this man a few times.

392
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,240
Ouyang Feng, do you really want to die here?

393
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,600
You kidnap a mom?

394
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,240
I'm not that kind of scum.

395
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,280
In the early years,

396
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,200
YouRonge's investigative database

397
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,680
is full of clues.

398
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,480
Come here.

399
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,720
Honestly,

400
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,360
I'm really involved in this alliance.

401
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,680
Thanks.

402
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,320
Excuse me,

403
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,280
do you know

404
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,760
where is the wooden ia?

405
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,000
No idea!

406
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,120
Few minutes ago,

407
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,120
Didn't anyone retreat?

408
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,080
We couldn't.

409
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,120
They wouldn't � are here.

410
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,160
Go down.

411
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,060
Dan Mi,

412
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:04,880
since you were a little girl,

413
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,160
you deliberately grow used to us.

414
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,140
Your word of worry

415
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,340
from the civil service department to the government.

416
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,860
You're nothing!

417
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,620
You're here.

418
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,820
You're using your enemy to hurt your own family.

419
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,180
I'll kill you!

420
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,180
There's nothing to say about the Hall Leader.

421
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,180
Yu Die, continue to bury him.

422
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,180
Father.

423
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,100
Father.

424
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:28,820
Burry him!

425
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,660
I'm not willful!

426
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,420
I just want to find the one I like.

427
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,700
I'll listen to him and be with him.

428
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,220
I don't want to be with him!

429
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,900
You're still not willful.

430
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,700
What do you like?

431
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,380
Have you asked him if he likes you?

432
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,980
I don't hate him.

433
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,180
I don't hate him.

434
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,700
I'll help you.

435
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,220
Continue to bury him. I'll go and check.

436
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,140
Stop!

437
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,140
Stop!

438
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,620
Hu Zuo Qin.

439
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,020
Did you kill my brother?

440
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,180
Tie Lin is dead.

441
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,060
Pull him up.

442
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,780
Are you going to use two against one again?

443
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,660
Sister.

444
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,260
Untie the acupoint.

445
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,980
Yu Die!

446
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,700
You don't know about the clothes.

447
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,020
You don't know about men.

448
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,980
You still don't know about my heart?

449
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,740
I can't untie the way the Head of the Fu family

450
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,260
uses to beat the acupoint.

451
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:32,580
The iron wooden flag of the Chai family must be on it.

452
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,980
It's not easy to untie it.

453
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,180
It's not easy to untie it.

454
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,380
It's not easy to untie it.

455
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:39,020
It must be the iron wooden flag of the Chai family.

456
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,180
The Head of the Fu family buried it.

457
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,500
When Peng Zhe Che was alive,

458
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,260
not a single person knew about the iron wooden flag.

459
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,820
The iron wooden flag was the second master of the Chai family.

460
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,180
Tonight, everyone will die here.

461
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,460
Qi Qing.

462
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,620
Don't move.

463
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,300
Qi Qin.

464
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,220
If he doesn't move, I'll die.

465
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,340
I'll deal with him.

466
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,420
You go and be the scapegoat.

467
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,900
Qi Qing.

468
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,140
You're not afraid of me?

469
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,320
I won'tNote to you.

470
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,180
To you.

471
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,060
Thank you seven days.

472
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,660
It must have been hard.

473
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:05,460
For two years and three years.

474
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:06,940
Yang Meng.

475
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,460
Yang Meng.

476
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,180
Yang Meng, speak.

477
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,980
Speak, Yang Meng.

478
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,260
Speak.

479
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,340
I'm fine.

480
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,940
I just can't move.

481
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,340
Who's that woman in the painting?

482
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,220
You're still talking about her?

483
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,780
Who is she?

484
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,100
You crazy woman.

485
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:37,860
Get me out of here.

486
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,700
The chain and the painting

487
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,180
are gone.

488
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,620
Get me out of here.

489
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:52,940
Let me solve it.

490
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,380
I'll help them.

491
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,860
It's useless.

492
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,140
It's useless.

493
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,300
Ou Yaofeng.

494
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,380
Promise me.

495
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:02,940
Don't speak.

496
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:03,780
Don't move.

497
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,060
What are you doing?

498
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,060
Just empty the hole.

499
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:10,820
Mr.�리alf Zapiao,

500
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:14,540
we left

501
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,860
everything here on you.

502
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:17,900
I should kill you.

503
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:19,540
Enough.

504
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,740
Save it, unearth it.

505
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,940
When Designly Pingpings Office was here,

506
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,580
you built all of us together here.

507
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,580
If I don't wake up in the next life,

508
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,580
I will be your friend.

509
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,580
I will be your friend forever.

510
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,580
Daming!

511
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,580
Daming!

512
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,580
Give me the blood!

513
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,580
Give me the blood!

514
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,580
Give it to me!

515
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,580
Daming!

516
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,580
Spread out!

517
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,580
Search every corner of the temple!

518
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,580
Daming!

519
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,580
This way!

520
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,580
Put down the gun!

521
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,580
Go!

522
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,580
Go!

523
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,580
Father!

524
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,580
Daming!

525
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,580
Daming!

526
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,580
Ruyi!

527
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,580
Ruyi!

528
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:34,580
Ruyi!

529
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,580
Here.

530
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,580
Be careful.

531
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,580
Here.

532
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,580
Here, be careful.

533
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,580
Tea.

534
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,580
You eat.

535
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,580
Okay.

536
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,580
Master.

537
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,580
The fire demon is here.

538
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,580
Take Miss Feng.

539
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:50,580
It's been an hour.

540
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:53,580
In an hour,

541
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,580
she will wake up.

542
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,580
She will wake up.

543
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,580
In an hour,

544
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,580
she will wake up.

545
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:04,580
She doesn't even know who she is.

546
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,580
How to solve it?

547
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:10,580
You can kill Hu Mao.

548
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:15,580
Kill everyone here.

549
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,580
But the way to detoxify the poison

550
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,580
can't tell you.

551
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,580
Let her believe.

552
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,580
I have a big thing to do

553
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,580
in Jiangzhou Cloud Water Village.

554
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,580
You helped me deal with

555
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,580
the masters of the fire demon and the gold sugar.

556
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,580
I'm satisfied with what you're going to do.

557
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,580
I've removed Miss Feng's poison

558
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,580
and let you go.

559
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,580
The Three Stars Palace.

560
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,580
The Three Stars Palace is not coming?

561
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,580
No.

562
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,580
Why?

563
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,580
I've been waiting in Lin'an for two days.

564
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,580
I'm worried that

565
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:05,580
Jia Xiaodu of Chunfeng House is very popular recently.

566
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,580
He will win Lin'an

567
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:10,580
in ten years.

568
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,580
His calligraphy is a little bad.

569
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,580
But it's not bad.

570
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:22,580
I asked him to learn fighting in Cloud Water Village.

571
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,580
But he didn't come.

572
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,580
I'm worried that

573
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:31,580
he will play chess with Jia Xiaodu in three days.

574
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,580
I've informed him.

575
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:36,580
The elegant people of Lin'an will come.

576
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,580
They will come to Cloud Water Village

577
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,580
to have a good time.

578
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,580
For a song,

579
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,580
you don't care about the martial arts.

580
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,580
You're a coward.

581
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,580
If he doesn't come,

582
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:54,580
no one will come to the gold hall.

583
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,580
The Three Stars Palace

584
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,580
is not worth his sister in my hand.

585
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,580
I know.

586
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,580
He said

587
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,580
if the official of Chai House killed Miss Dan Min,

588
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:08,580
he would take revenge on the gold hall.

589
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:11,580
If Miss Dan Min didn't die,

590
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,580
why would he fight with the Chai House?

591
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,580
Uncle,

592
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,580
the second master of the House of Protectors

593
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,580
has been waiting for more than an hour.

594
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,580
The Qin people

595
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:26,580
agreed to work with the Chai House.

596
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:29,580
They agreed to work with the Gold Hall.

597
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,580
What do you think?

598
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,580
Uncle,

599
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,580
the second master of the House of Protectors

600
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,580
wants us to work together

601
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,580
in Cloud Water Village.

602
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,580
How can we work together

603
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,580
if the Three Stars Palace doesn't come?

604
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:50,580
Good.

605
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,580
I'll kill this coward.

606
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,580
Your brother doesn't care.

607
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,580
He'd rather play chess

608
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:08,580
with a singer in Lin'an City.

609
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,580
Stop talking nonsense.

610
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:15,580
Kill me if you dare.

611
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:23,580
Your Excellency,

612
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:25,580
Master Chai is back.

613
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:26,580
Who?

614
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:27,580
Master Chai Qiong.

615
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,580
He's drinking in Hu Xinting.

616
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:31,580
Ji Jiang.

617
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:32,580
Your Excellency.

618
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:34,580
Lin Tiemu is dead?

619
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,580
Yes.

620
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:38,580
Keep an eye on Dan Min.

621
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:40,580
Bring him here when it's time.

622
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,580
Yes.

623
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,580
What's wrong?

624
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:48,580
Brother, I'm fine.

625
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,580
Brother, I'm fine.

626
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:52,580
How did Tie Lin Tiemu die?

627
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:55,580
He died in the hands of Fu Ruoqing,

628
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:57,580
the official of the Gold Hall.

629
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:58,580
Go.

630
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:20,580
Get me the wine.

631
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:29,580
Get me the wine.

632
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,580
What did Dan Xingbian say?

633
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:38,580
He said

634
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:41,580
he was not interested in the martial arts.

635
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:42,580
He could have fought

636
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,580
with Yan Ba and Chai Jia.

637
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,580
I didn't say anything else.

638
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:48,580
I don't want to say anything else

639
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:50,580
to Dan Xingbian.

640
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:52,580
Since you're here,

641
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:56,580
let's fight.

642
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:58,580
Chief,

643
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:00,580
Yun Shui Village is full of skilled fighters.

644
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:02,580
It's not a big deal.

645
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:05,580
You're here, so it's a big deal.

646
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:08,580
I'll do my best.

647
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:22,580
Chief,

648
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:24,580
you're good at both sides.

649
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:27,580
Don't you want to live?

650
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:30,580
Chief, don't be angry.

651
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,580
Listen to me.

652
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:34,580
What else can I say?

653
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:41,580
From now on,

654
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,580
you're not allowed to fight with me.

655
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,580
I'm not afraid of you.

656
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,580
I'm not afraid of you.

657
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:53,580
You, Chai Yu,

658
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:56,580
listen to my order.

659
00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:00,580
There's no Chai Jia in the martial arts world.
