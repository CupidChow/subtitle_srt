The Untamed

00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,600
I was already leaving.

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,000
I came back to tell you

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,600
that the caretaker will take you on the road tomorrow.

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,000
He's going to Jiangzhou.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,400
I'll go too. I'll be right behind you.

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,200
I'll talk to you when it's convenient.

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,000
When it's convenient for you.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,600
Okay.

11
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,200
The candle hasn't been extinguished. Do you want me to extinguish it for you?

12
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,200
Thank you.

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,200
The Untamed

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,400
Chief Hu.

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,000
Have you thought it through?

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,600
I'll go with you tomorrow.

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,400
Brother Ouyang and I are going to Lin'an Prefecture.

18
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,800
I've prepared three horses. You and your brother will be on the road.

19
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,600
I don't know how to thank you.

20
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,600
If it's convenient,

21
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,200
I'll see if I can save the disabled.

22
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,200
It's a small matter.

23
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,800
Where is the wound?

24
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,200
The spine.

25
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,800
I hurt it when I was young.

26
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,600
It's an old wound from the past.

27
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,200
It's been 18 years.

28
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,800
It's over.

29
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,600
The Untamed

30
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:51,600
The Untamed

31
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,600
The Untamed

32
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,000
Chief Hu, you've practiced martial arts.

33
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Unlike Feng Heng, you're an ordinary person.

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,600
You just met me at that moment.

35
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,600
Now, meeting the demon is also a blessing.

36
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But every three days,

37
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
you'll have to take the medicine twice.

38
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,400
You'll take the pill for nine times.

39
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,600
The second time, you'll take the pill for 21 days.

40
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,200
You can walk like a normal person.

41
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,000
But you can't practice martial arts anymore.

42
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,200
Take the pill for nine times.

43
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,600
Can I have it now?

44
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,600
As long as you can make it again,

45
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,200
you can get the poison.

46
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,600
As long as I can walk like a normal person, I don't care.

47
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:21,200
It's not that you can't give it to me. But you need to take it after six days and two times.

48
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,200
You should give it to me now.

49
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,200
Thank you.

50
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,200
Thank you.

51
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,200
The Untamed

52
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,200
A'Li, my son.

53
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,200
The poison is a long time to be cured.

54
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:30,200
I'll cure him and let him suffer.

55
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:37,200
Let him suffer for a long time.

56
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,200
The Untamed

57
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,000
I saved your life.

58
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,200
Wei Wenxian.

59
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,800
Why did you save me?

60
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,400
Because the one who hurt you was the Chai family.

61
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,800
I gave those bad guys a chance to make up for it.

62
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,800
It's not because you're good or bad.

63
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,600
I'd rather be a kid.

64
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Young Master.

65
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,800
It's okay.

66
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,800
He'll wake up in half an hour.

67
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,600
He'll wake up as soon as I water him.

68
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,800
Why didn't you water him?

69
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,600
Are you asking me? Why should I water him?

70
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,800
I'm here for you two.

71
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:45,200
The Untamed

72
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,600
The kid is in good shape.

73
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,200
He's been practicing for two hours.

74
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,200
I've been waiting for you for half an hour.

75
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,200
You're still so lonely.

76
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,200
What are you doing here?

77
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,200
Gold.

78
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,200
The friend asked me to give you the gold.

79
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,200
He asked me to give it to you.

80
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,200
But I have two pieces of it.

81
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,200
I've kept it.

82
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,200
When I came here, I ran away when I saw the iron tomb.

83
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,200
Iron tomb?

84
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,200
You have to thank me.

85
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,200
Thank you.

86
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,200
You're welcome.

87
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,200
Thank you, Mr. Chai.

88
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,200
Do you think I'm honest and honest?

89
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,200
I'll kowtow to you.

90
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,200
I'll thank you if you should.

91
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,200
Mr. Chai's martial arts is the best.

92
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,200
Of course, I'll do whatever I want.

93
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,200
I'm the best in Cuihua House in Jiangling.

94
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,200
I'm the best in the world.

95
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,200
Your friend Huang Yaoshi is better than me.

96
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,200
Brother Yao?

97
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,200
Impossible.

98
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,200
He's the best.

99
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,200
He's good at everything.

100
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,200
But it's okay. I'll wait for him to come back.

101
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,200
How many masters are there in the Southern Dynasties?

102
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,200
The Song Dynasty.

103
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,200
The Song Dynasty.

104
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,200
There weren't many masters.

105
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,200
Now there's a Huang Yaoshi.

106
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,200
You're still here?

107
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,200
He killed Pan Jie.

108
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,200
Why?

109
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,200
The knife on Mr. Pan's body is yours.

110
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,200
I didn't expect you wouldn't even recognize it.

111
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,200
You killed Nian Yu and Bi Dao.

112
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,200
Blood is spitting.

113
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
Mr. Pan's martial arts skills are very good.

114
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
Blood is spitting.

115
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,200
Mr. Pan's martial arts skills are very good.

116
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,200
Even my brother Lie died in his hands.

117
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,200
How could I kill him?

118
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,200
Your brother Lie died in my brother Pan's hands.

119
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,200
That's why you killed him.

120
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,200
You even called him Brother Pan.

121
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,200
The people from the Western Regions are really unthinkable.

122
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,200
You killed him?

123
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,200
I can't say it.

124
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,200
I cried.

125
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,200
I'll kill you and avenge Brother Pan.

126
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,200
Kill him.

127
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,200
Stop.

128
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,200
You're such a fool.

129
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,200
You're a spy.

130
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,200
You even helped us to collect the corpses.

131
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
He did it.

132
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,200
You're a sharp tongue from the Western Regions.

133
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,200
I'll let you talk.

134
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,200
Where is Da Min?

135
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,200
Miss was taken away by the Chai family.

136
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,200
We didn't catch her.

137
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,200
Why did she come back?

138
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,200
She killed Brother Pan.

139
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,200
You're in the same boat with the Chai family.

140
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,200
You poisoned Jiu Cai.

141
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,200
You poisoned her.

142
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,200
You poisoned her to let Tie Lin and Tie Mu take Miss away.

143
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
I was poisoned too.

144
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
Of course you have to pretend.

145
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,200
Aren't you standing here right now?

146
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,200
Nonsense.

147
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,200
You told me to poison Jiu Cai.

148
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,200
You even told Tie to kill me and my young master.

149
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,200
Tie Mo is a top-level master.

150
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,200
If he wants to kill you, you can still live here.

151
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,200
I'm not poisoned.

152
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,200
What's wrong with being a top-level master?

153
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,200
You poisoned yourself.

154
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,200
You're a man.

155
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,200
You and the Chai family are a team.

156
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,200
Mr. Chai came to send gold.

157
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,200
Tie Mu who drove her away.

158
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,200
Who?

159
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,200
Jiang Wu Lin.

160
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,200
You're very popular.

161
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,200
What are you?

162
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,200
You're a little thing with a face.

163
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,200
You're still rude.

164
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,200
I'll beat you up.

165
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,200
I'll clean up your old thing first.

166
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,200
Stop.

167
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,200
Is your old master's surname Chai?

168
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,200
How?

169
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,200
If you're old Chai Qiong,

170
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,200
I'm Tang Long.

171
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,200
Twelve years ago,

172
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
I met you once.

173
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,200
I'm in Cuihua Tower every day.

174
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,200
Why do you want to see me?

175
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,200
Mr. Chai.

176
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,200
Tie Mu is a master of the Chai family.

177
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,200
He killed Ouyang Feng.

178
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,200
Why do you want to save him?

179
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,200
Who said I saved him?

180
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,200
Nonsense.

181
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,200
I'm too lazy to do it.

182
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
Jiang Wu Lin,

183
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,200
I can't even hide from it.

184
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,200
I'm here to pay off the gambling debt.

185
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,200
I just came.

186
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,200
I know what you're talking about.

187
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,200
Did you hear that?

188
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,200
It's these two people in the Western Regions.

189
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,200
They're talking nonsense.

190
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,200
Kill them.

191
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,200
Give the lady and the man a reward.

192
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,200
You were rude just now.

193
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,200
You're talking nonsense.

194
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,200
Take two more.

195
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,200
What?

196
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,200
Let's go together.

197
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,200
Kill them all.

198
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,200
I have to.

199
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,200
But you have to listen to the truth.

200
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,200
The Chai family or the Forbidden City Hall,

201
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,200
it's none of my business.

202
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,200
I've only wanted to go to Lin'an Prefecture since I came from the Western Regions.

203
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,200
Don't bother me anymore.

204
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,200
It's a good thing to go to your lady.

205
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,200
Hit them.

206
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,200
Come on.

207
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,200
Listen to Mr. Ouyang.

208
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
I'm here to pay off the gambling debt.

209
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,200
But if there's anything that the Forbidden City Hall doesn't understand,

210
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,200
we'll come back for it.

211
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,200
What are you waiting for?

212
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,200
You're...

213
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
Do you want to go?

214
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,200
I've been depressed all night.

215
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,200
Whoever gets the punishment is unlucky.

216
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,200
I'll go.

217
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,200
From now on,

218
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,200
you're the only one who can control the road.

219
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,200
You don't bother people or ask questions.

220
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,200
Master, when have we ever been afraid?

221
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,200
Kill one is enough.

222
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,200
Kill two is worth it.

223
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,200
I'm not afraid.

224
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,200
It's only right to go to Lin'an Prefecture to see Miss Liu Ru Si and go back to the Western Regions.

225
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,200
Brother Lie died for nothing.

226
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,200
The person who killed Brother Lie is dead too.

227
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,200
I didn't kill him.

228
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,200
I tried my best.

229
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,200
I didn't even touch his clothes.

230
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,200
And he only used one hand and one foot.

231
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,200
You saw it.

232
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,200
What about Mr. Huang?

233
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,200
Are you going to kill him?

234
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,200
Brother Yao is a master too.

235
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,200
How high can he be?

236
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,200
I want to know too.

237
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,200
I'll wait for you until dawn.

238
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,200
Mr. Chai,

239
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,200
where's the gold?

240
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,200
It's inside.

241
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,200
What about my Ouyang brothers?

242
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,200
It's also inside.

243
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,200
Thank you.

244
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,200
Come down.

245
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,200
Let's fight.

246
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,200
Why?

247
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,200
You're a fool.

248
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,200
You lost two games in a row.

249
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,200
You should make a move first.

250
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,200
If I don't know the reason,

251
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,200
how can I get my brother's gold back?

252
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,200
It's fair to gamble.

253
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,200
Come down and fight.

254
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,200
I haven't met my opponent for ten years.

255
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,200
I just lost in Cuihua House.

256
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,200
If we don't compete,

257
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,200
how can I live a peaceful life?

258
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,200
Ouyang brothers,

259
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,200
should we find a place to rest first

260
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,200
or go on the road now?

261
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,200
Where did you get the horse?

262
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,200
Chief Hu gave it to me.

263
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,200
When we get there,

264
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,200
we can ride six horses in a row.

265
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,200
It's good.

266
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,200
Our horses are gone.

267
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,200
Let's go.

268
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,200
You can't leave.

269
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,200
Mr. Chai,

270
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,200
let's not fight.

271
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,200
If you don't fight,

272
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,200
I will.

273
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,200
You're a wise man.

274
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,200
You won't force people.

275
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,200
Right?

276
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,200
Go.

277
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,200
You just came and left.

278
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,200
How can I live a peaceful life?

279
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,200
Go.

280
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
Where are you taking me?

281
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,200
Say it.

282
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,200
Mr. Chai is waiting for Miss Dan

283
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,200
in Yun Shui Village.

284
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,200
I'm hungry.

285
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,200
I'm thirsty.

286
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,200
Here.

287
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,200
I need to change my clothes.

288
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,200
I'm dressed like this.

289
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,200
Can you see?

290
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,200
I'm not a girl.

291
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,200
Can you see me?

292
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,200
What's the difference between Miss Dan and me?

293
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,200
I can see you.

294
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,200
You need to dress up

295
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,200
to be a girl.

296
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,200
There is a clothing store

297
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,200
in Pengze County.

298
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,200
I need to wash my face.

299
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,200
Okay.

300
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,200
Then let's go to the county.

301
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,200
Go.

302
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,200
Miss Feng,

303
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,200
it's not convenient for you

304
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,200
to ride a horse

305
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,200
after a long journey.

306
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,200
There is something else

307
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,200
about this car.

308
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,200
I'm disabled.

309
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,200
Miss Feng,

310
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,200
don't worry.

311
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,200
I'm here.

312
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,200
I'm here.

313
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,200
I'm here.

314
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,200
I'm here.

315
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,200
I'm here.

316
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,200
I'm here.

317
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,200
I'm here.

318
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,200
I'm here.

319
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,200
I'll fix it for you

320
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,200
in three days.

321
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,200
If you fix it again tomorrow,

322
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,200
it will be fixed.

323
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,200
Miss Feng,

324
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,200
don't worry.

325
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,200
I'm not worried.

326
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,200
Really?

327
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,200
I'm not worried

328
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,200
with him here.

329
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,200
Do you like him?

330
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,200
Of course.

331
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,200
Does he like you?

332
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,200
He will like me.

333
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,200
It's rare

334
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
to have a good person

335
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,200
like Huang Yaoshi.

336
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,200
And he's so good at martial arts.

337
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,200
Right?

338
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,200
Yes.

339
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,200
He's not far from here.

340
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,200
He will contact me

341
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,200
at half way.

342
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,200
We agreed last night.

343
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,200
Miss,

344
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,200
your father is dead.

345
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,200
Don't talk too much.

346
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,200
My son is dead, too.

347
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,200
It's all in the past.

348
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,200
I'll help you and Huang Yaoshi

349
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,200
even if I do

350
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,200
a good thing.

351
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,200
Although I didn't

352
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,200
hear you before,

353
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,200
I know

354
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,200
what kind of person you are.

355
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,200
What kind of person?

356
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,200
A bad person is hard to change.

357
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,200
You're the kind

358
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,200
who won't change.

359
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
I'm young.

360
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,200
But I've been with my father

361
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,200
in the Northeast of the South and North.

362
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,200
I've seen many people.

363
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,200
There are fewer good people

364
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,200
than bad people in the world.

365
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,200
There are fewer good people

366
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,200
like Huang Yaoshi.

367
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,200
You're too scheming.

368
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,200
You're scheming.

369
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,200
You must have a different intention

370
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,200
to do this.

371
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,200
I have an intention.

372
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,200
You

373
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,200
need to use me to solve the soul-strain.

374
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,200
I'll ask Huang Yaoshi

375
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,200
to cure my body.

376
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,200
What are you going to do

377
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,200
after you're cured?

378
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,200
Miss Feng,

379
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,200
it's no good to think about it.

380
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,200
Huang Yaoshi

381
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,200
hasn't thought about taking you away.

382
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,200
He's right.

383
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,200
He has read many books

384
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,200
and can't forget them.

385
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
He also knows

386
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,200
many, many things.

387
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,200
When he was leaving,

388
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,200
I helped him eliminate

389
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,200
the bamboo fire in the room

390
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,200
and stand on the torch

391
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,200
to listen to his breath.

392
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,200
Later,

393
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,200
his breath

394
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,200
became more and more peaceful

395
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,200
until he fell asleep.

396
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,200
You're in the corridor in his room

397
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,200
Can you hear the smell of the room?

398
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,200
Yes

399
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,200
Ouyang

400
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,200
I'm here

401
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,200
I'm here

402
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,200
I'm here

403
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,200
Ouyang

404
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,200
Did I do something wrong?

405
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
You have experience in this

406
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,200
If I did something wrong, you should tell me

407
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,200
I have experience?

408
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,200
You asked me to see him

409
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,200
Did I do something wrong?

410
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,200
You only know to say yourself

411
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,200
Do you know how I spent last night?

412
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,200
You...

413
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,200
I lost all my gold

414
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,200
Of course, you won again

415
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,200
After losing all my gold, I lost three pieces of opium

416
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,200
I was beaten in the corridor

417
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,200
Since I learned the martial arts of Mount Baituo

418
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,200
I think I have few opponents

419
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:58,780
I used the horse's body to build the

420
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,780
Did you ask me to see Feng Heng?

421
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,780
When did I ask you to see him?

422
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,780
When?

423
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,780
You came back and you want to make a bet with Feng Heng and me

424
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,780
Are we still friends?

425
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,780
I have no friends for many years

426
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,780
I'm willing to do anything for you

427
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,780
Stop talking about this

428
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,780
You have lived for many years

429
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,780
You are so stupid

430
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,780
You are so stupid

431
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,780
You are so stupid

432
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,780
You are so stupid

433
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,780
You are so stupid

434
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,780
You are so stupid

435
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,780
I don't know

436
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,780
I...

437
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,780
You came here and talked to me

438
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,780
You met him once

439
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,780
You said you liked me

440
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,780
You want to be with me forever

441
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,780
Oh my god

442
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,780
Luckily, there is poison in the leek

443
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,780
Zhao Ge and the people of the Purple Golden Hall beat me outside

444
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,780
I beat them inside

445
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,780
I can't understand a word

446
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,780
If it wasn't for the gold from Mr. Chen

447
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,780
I would have died

448
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,780
Do you know martial arts?

449
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,780
It doesn't matter

450
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,780
It's important

451
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,780
I don't want to talk about it

452
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,780
I'm too selfish

453
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,780
I always talk about my own business

454
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,780
Then

455
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,780
I'll tell you

456
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,780
No

457
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,780
Why are you so slow?

458
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,780
You are not a foodie

459
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,780
Go

460
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,780
Go

461
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,780
He wants you to support him

462
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,780
It's a mess

463
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,780
But not like you

464
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,780
I treat him as a friend

465
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,780
He will kill me if I don't take him away

466
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,780
How can I do it?

467
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,780
He is so scared

468
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,780
He will kill me if I don't agree

469
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,780
What's going on?

470
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,780
I asked you to be my colleague in Kuizhou

471
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,780
I want you to tell me about the culture of the South

472
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,780
Now you tell me

473
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,780
What?

474
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,780
Do you know martial arts?

475
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,780
You are a master

476
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,780
Dan Mi? Where is she?

477
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,780
She was caught by the master of the Chai family

478
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,780
Chai family?

479
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,780
Why?

480
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,780
How can I know?

481
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,780
It's none of my business

482
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,780
If I was caught by someone, it's none of your business?

483
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,780
It's different

484
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,780
You are a man, he is a woman

485
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,780
I see

486
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,780
Ouyang

487
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,780
You should go to him

488
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,780
Why?

489
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,780
You should tell him your thoughts

490
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,780
Otherwise you will be confused

491
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,780
You swear I won't like this kind of woman

492
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,780
You should tell him

493
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,780
I will know it myself

494
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,780
What if he dies?

495
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,780
You know it's useless

496
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,780
Your heart will be confused

497
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,780
Go

498
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,780
I am going to catch you

499
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,780
He is here for you

500
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,780
I...

501
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,780
I hate trouble

502
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,780
He is running away

503
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,780
Ouyang Feng

504
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,780
You don't look good

505
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,780
Are you in a bad mood?

506
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,780
Go

507
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,780
Go

508
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,780
Tieguo

509
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,780
Stop

510
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,780
Tieguo

511
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,780
The city was flooded a month ago

512
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,780
Only six soldiers were killed

513
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,780
Go

514
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,780
Tieguo

515
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,780
Tieguo

516
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,780
Tieguo, there is a horse team from Yan

517
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,780
Yan?

518
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,780
Yes, two big horses

519
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,780
27 soldiers, 36 horses

520
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,780
Tieguo, you are in the wrong place

521
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,780
Go

522
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,780
Where should we change clothes?

523
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,780
There is a clothing store in the front

524
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,780
I went there last year

525
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,780
Feng Zui is so busy now

526
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,780
Where can there be a clothing store?

527
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,780
Let's see

528
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,780
What if there is?

529
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,780
Stop

530
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,780
It's the Chai family

531
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,780
The Chai family

532
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,780
What should we do?

533
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,780
What should we do?

534
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,780
Are you afraid?

535
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,780
Yes

536
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,780
I am a woman, you are more than ten

537
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,780
The Chai family has two masters

538
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,780
What should we be afraid of?

539
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,780
Let's go

540
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,780
Let's go

541
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,780
Go

542
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,780
Go

543
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,780
Go

544
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,780
Go

545
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,780
Anyone here?

546
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,780
Anyone here?

547
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,780
Wait

548
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,780
Mr. Feng Zui is free

549
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,780
Mr. Feng

550
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,780
What are you doing here?

551
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,780
What's your name?

552
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,780
Xu Qing

553
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,780
What's your rank in the Chai family's martial arts ranking?

554
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,780
Get off

555
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,780
Wen Lihua

556
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,780
Who are you?

557
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,780
Why are you here?

558
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,780
I am here to find a job

559
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,780
The official clothes in the store

560
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,780
are not moved

561
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,780
The flood is gone

562
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,780
Come back to clean and repair

563
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,780
Business

564
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,780
will come sooner or later

565
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,780
You are here

566
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,780
I don't know

567
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,780
What are you doing here?

568
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,780
I am here to find a job

569
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,780
Riku

570
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,780
Where was this?

571
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:52,780
To help you

572
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:55,660
Da战

573
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,960
かった

574
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,960
What should I do?

575
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,960
Wait

576
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,960
Do you want to die?

577
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,340
Yes

578
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,820
the hand using pipe

579
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,660
There are polluted webs in the clothes

580
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,860
the makeup is exquisite

581
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:19,220
We need to save some

582
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,100
Okay

583
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:27,260
I'll go in

584
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,340
Wait a minute

585
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,340
Why are you still tied up?

586
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,340
Come here

587
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,340
What's going on?

588
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,340
There's no way back

589
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,340
The pigeon is too old

590
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,340
This lady is a master

591
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,340
Bra autograph the pig to save your life

592
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,340
It's a good one.

593
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,140
Fu Ruoqing.

594
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,340
Do you want some tea?

595
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:17,340
The water is from a far place.

596
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,940
It's more precious than tea leaves.

597
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,340
Fu Ruoqing.

598
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,340
I'm a man of iron.

599
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,340
I'm not your opponent.

600
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,340
But I'm a man of seven qings.

601
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,340
You don't have to think about it.

602
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:37,340
So it's the iron forest of the Chai family and the two qings.

603
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,340
So you'd better not worry about it.

604
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,340
Or you'll lose your life.

605
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,340
Let me take Dan Min to Jiangzhou.

606
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,340
It's easy to say.

607
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,340
When Dan Min changes his clothes,

608
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,340
I'll say a few words and send you away.

609
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,340
What words?

610
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,340
The little girl came to me specially

611
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,340
and said she liked a man.

612
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,340
I'm her father.

613
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,340
I have to say a few words.

614
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,340
Have some tea.

615
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,340
Then wait and see.

616
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,340
Little girl.

617
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,340
It's slow to change clothes and wash your face.

618
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,340
You two work together.

619
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,340
Not only I don't have a chance,

620
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,340
you don't either.

621
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,340
If you have a chance to talk,

622
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,340
why bother to fight with each other?

623
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,340
You're right.

624
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,340
I'm not old.

625
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,340
Don't call me father.

626
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,340
You're a senior.

627
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,340
I'm a senior in the Zijin Hall.

628
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,340
You don't have to be polite.

629
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,340
Here.

630
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,340
Mr. Huang.

631
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,340
You missed the way.

632
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,340
I'm here to tell you

633
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,340
that you can rest in the city.

634
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,340
If you want to go to the city,

635
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,340
the chief has prepared the meal.

636
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,340
If you want to go,

637
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,340
please tell me where to stay.

638
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,340
The chief can take you there.

639
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,340
I know. Thank you.

640
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,340
Go.

641
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,340
Go.

642
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:29,340
Let's go.

643
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,340
Let's say goodbye.

644
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,340
Ouyang won't go to the city?

645
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,340
I'll go to Ling'an.

646
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,340
I won't go to Pengzi.

647
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,340
I'll go back as soon as possible.

648
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,340
I won't go.

649
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:45,340
We met by chance.

650
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,340
We'll part ways no matter how far we go.

651
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,340
Why do you say that?

652
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,340
Since Gu Kui Zhou came to Jiangling,

653
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,340
Ouyang Feng did tell Brother Yao.

654
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,340
Xinlan.

655
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,340
Brother Zhao and I are still prohibited from going to Ling'an.

656
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,340
You asked me to find Miss Feng.

657
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,340
Then you go.

658
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,340
Don't worry about it.

659
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,340
I'm leaving.

660
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,340
Go. Go find Dan Mian.

661
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,340
Where can we find the Great Emperor?

662
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,340
The south's martial art is so deep.

663
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,340
What can we do?

664
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,340
Can't you wait for me?

665
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,340
Brother Yao.

666
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,340
Tell me the truth.

667
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,340
Who are you?

668
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,340
I'm not who I am.

669
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,340
Huang Xiaoshi.

670
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,340
I knew you would go this way.

671
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,340
Mr. Chai. What do you want?

672
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,340
Tell me the truth.

673
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,340
Who are you?

674
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,340
I'm not who I am.

675
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,340
Then it's even more strange.

676
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:17,340
We must fight.

677
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,340
You're not as good as me.

678
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,340
I can go back to Cuihua House and continue to gamble.

679
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,340
Brother Ouyang.

680
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,340
Help me persuade him. I refuse to leave.

681
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,340
You're not allowed to leave.

682
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,340
He doesn't even deserve to bring me shoes.

683
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,340
What can I say to him?

684
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,340
Let's go, Brother Yao.

685
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,340
Don't move.

686
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,340
Don't hide.

687
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,340
Are you going to fight or not?

688
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,340
I'm angry.

689
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,340
Wait for me.

690
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,340
I'm so angry.

691
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,340
This is the way to Lian'an.

692
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,340
From now on,

693
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,340
you won't hear anything.

694
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,340
Mr. Fu.

695
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,340
Where's the water?

696
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:51,340
It's inside.

697
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,340
Take it out and pour it out.

698
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:03,340
Give it to me.

699
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,340
Do you want some tea?

700
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,340
Yes.

701
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,340
I'll go get some.

702
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,340
I'm not allowed to leave.

703
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,340
I have to come in.

704
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,340
Tell me.

705
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,340
Let's drive them away first.

706
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,340
Can't outsiders hear about you?

707
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,340
I asked Brother Pan Jie

708
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,340
and Brother Yu Dingwu to be brothers and sisters.

709
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,340
I asked Ouyang Feng to have a meal in Jiangling and drink.

710
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,340
The people from the Chai family poisoned me and took me away.

711
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,340
I don't know what Ouyang Feng did.

712
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,340
Let them talk.

713
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,340
Who is Ouyang Feng?

714
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,340
He's someone I like.

715
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,340
He's from the Western Regions. No one knows him.

716
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,340
I've decided.

717
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,340
I want to be with him forever.

718
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,340
I'm not.

719
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,340
Why?

720
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,340
I don't...

721
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,340
Why?

722
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,340
It's a good thing.

723
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,340
Is he a good family?

724
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:29,340
He should be.

725
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,340
He's good at martial arts.

726
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,340
Don't stay in Jiangling.

727
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,340
We're going to drive him away.

728
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,340
I'm here.

729
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,340
You want to leave?

730
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:47,340
Does Ouyang Feng like you?

731
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:51,340
If he doesn't like me, why would he drink with me?

732
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,340
They poisoned Ouyang Feng.

733
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,340
Did you hurt Ouyang Feng?

734
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,340
Miss Dan asked you.

735
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:03,340
Tell her.

736
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,340
So she can get in.

737
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,340
Deutschen das buttons

738
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,340
Don't move.

739
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:37,340
Your dad tried to help you.

740
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:39,340
Mister.

741
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:43,340
Don't move.

742
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:49,340
Ouyang Feng prepared it by Defense des Princes,

I dare not to argue with you.

747
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:59,740
Now that we're in Luodan,

748
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,100
it's time to pay for my brother Pan's life.

749
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,860
Stop talking nonsense.

750
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,940
Why are you so entangled?

751
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,700
The battle in Kuizhou City is not over yet.

752
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,420
I, Ouyang Feng, will not give up my martial arts.

753
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,180
It's better to deal with you.

754
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:14,860
Fine.

755
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,180
Now that he's injured,

00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,980
I'll make you pay.

00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:56,700
Don't worry.

00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,100
Finishing my martial arts.
