1
00:00:00,368 --> 00:00:02,000
Don't contact me anymore.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,248
What? Don't contact you?

3
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:12,710
Did you stay at

4
00:00:12,737 --> 00:00:13,816
Shin Jaemin's place yesterday?

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,924
Shin Jaemin?

6
00:00:18,053 --> 00:00:19,670
What exactly do you want?

7
00:00:19,929 --> 00:00:21,210
Why are you coming all the way to

8
00:00:21,223 --> 00:00:22,178
my workplace and making a scene?

9
00:00:22,203 --> 00:00:23,158
Your workplace?

10
00:00:23,183 --> 00:00:24,293
Get out.

11
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,183
- Get out right now...
- This is my company.

12
00:00:27,771 --> 00:00:29,146
What do you mean…

13
00:00:29,285 --> 00:00:30,362
Director!

14
00:00:31,024 --> 00:00:32,286
You're here.

15
00:00:34,611 --> 00:00:35,959
Department Director.

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,800
"Secret Relationships"

17
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,311
(Episode 3)
Shin Jaemin's lover?

18
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:50,451
Department Director. Shin Jaemin's place.

19
00:00:50,794 --> 00:00:52,129
The same clothes as yesterday?

20
00:00:53,963 --> 00:00:55,221
Assistant Ju.

21
00:00:55,246 --> 00:00:56,331
- Give this to Assistant Jung.
- Yes.

22
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:58,318
I'll give it to Director Shin Jaemin.

23
00:00:58,635 --> 00:00:59,744
Who is Shin Jaemin?

24
00:01:00,136 --> 00:01:01,554
Oh, sorry.

25
00:01:01,554 --> 00:01:03,098
I got lost in thought for a moment.

26
00:01:04,432 --> 00:01:05,850
Take a break while you work.

27
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,185
Make sure to deliver this to
Assistant Jung Daon.

28
00:01:07,477 --> 00:01:08,664
- Yes.
- Mm.

29
00:01:20,907 --> 00:01:22,282
What do you mean by Department Director?

30
00:01:23,827 --> 00:01:26,123
What are you scheming?

31
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,973
Why do you always do whatever you want…

32
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,684
You're so noisy.

33
00:01:32,085 --> 00:01:33,927
Ask one thing at a time.

34
00:01:37,006 --> 00:01:38,185
I already told you.

35
00:01:38,758 --> 00:01:40,051
This company belongs to me.

36
00:01:42,011 --> 00:01:43,011
Did you come back to

37
00:01:43,018 --> 00:01:44,198
inherit the company?

38
00:01:44,222 --> 00:01:45,393
No.

39
00:01:45,974 --> 00:01:47,070
The food over there

40
00:01:47,084 --> 00:01:48,035
didn't suit my taste.

41
00:01:48,059 --> 00:01:49,606
If that was your reason for coming back,

42
00:01:49,631 --> 00:01:50,746
then why did you leave?

43
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:51,913
Why?

44
00:01:51,938 --> 00:01:53,010
Did you really miss me

45
00:01:53,031 --> 00:01:54,217
that much when I left?

46
00:01:54,607 --> 00:01:55,984
How could that be?

47
00:01:56,276 --> 00:01:57,735
Then maybe you and Shin Jaemin

48
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:59,209
should've answered my calls.

49
00:02:00,334 --> 00:02:01,859
So that I wouldn't have to come back.

50
00:02:02,782 --> 00:02:03,938
Anyway, did you sleep at

51
00:02:03,963 --> 00:02:05,075
Shin Jaemin's place?

52
00:02:07,203 --> 00:02:08,388
That's none of your business.

53
00:02:08,413 --> 00:02:10,265
Why wouldn't it be?

54
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:12,041
It's about Shin Jaemin.

55
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:14,919
You, of all people, know best

56
00:02:14,944 --> 00:02:16,404
what kind of relationship we had.

57
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,648
I do.

58
00:02:18,965 --> 00:02:20,358
You broke up.

59
00:02:20,383 --> 00:02:21,432
Do you think a breakup

60
00:02:21,457 --> 00:02:22,463
is always the end?

61
00:02:23,178 --> 00:02:24,888
Maybe we'll get back together.

62
00:02:25,263 --> 00:02:26,609
Did you come back to try again

63
00:02:26,623 --> 00:02:27,867
with Jaemin hyung?

64
00:02:27,891 --> 00:02:29,289
Why?

65
00:02:30,393 --> 00:02:31,948
Why did you have to come back now

66
00:02:31,956 --> 00:02:32,948
and wreck one's life...

67
00:02:48,578 --> 00:02:50,500
Keep being loud like that.

68
00:02:51,998 --> 00:02:53,023
If you're curious where

69
00:02:53,037 --> 00:02:54,483
this ball will fly next time…

70
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,427
You know very well…

71
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:01,801
that I'm not just all talk, right?

72
00:03:11,017 --> 00:03:12,211
No matter where you go or

73
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:13,691
who you're with from now on.

74
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,627
Even when you finish work, you have

75
00:03:15,652 --> 00:03:16,884
to report everything to me.

76
00:03:17,078 --> 00:03:18,813
I never know when you and Shin Jaemin

77
00:03:18,827 --> 00:03:20,073
might start fooling around.

78
00:03:21,444 --> 00:03:22,612
I need to know everything.

79
00:03:23,211 --> 00:03:24,324
I don't think I have that

80
00:03:24,331 --> 00:03:25,752
kind of obligation to you.

81
00:03:25,776 --> 00:03:26,814
For a mere employee,

82
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,350
reporting to the company's director

83
00:03:28,371 --> 00:03:29,490
seems only natural.

84
00:03:32,142 --> 00:03:33,392
Get going.

85
00:03:36,292 --> 00:03:37,798
I don't understand why I need to

86
00:03:37,812 --> 00:03:39,272
report such private matters.

87
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:41,631
I will only report work-related matters.

88
00:03:42,465 --> 00:03:43,699
Department Director.

89
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:45,576
Hey!

90
00:03:45,927 --> 00:03:47,115
Hey!

91
00:04:06,136 --> 00:04:06,644
(Police station)

92
00:04:06,644 --> 00:04:08,838
(7 years ago)

93
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,152
Hyung, I'm sorry.

94
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:13,413
I shouldn't have called you...

95
00:04:13,413 --> 00:04:14,687
Damn it, I should have

96
00:04:14,694 --> 00:04:16,000
just killed that bastard.

97
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:19,777
By the way,

98
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,449
what do you mean by studying abroad?

99
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,957
Are you going abroad to study?

100
00:04:24,507 --> 00:04:25,550
Is it because of me?

101
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,777
Hey, don't flatter yourself.

102
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:30,035
Who do you think you are?

103
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,653
Do you really think I'd beat someone up

104
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,092
and go study abroad because of you?

105
00:04:33,116 --> 00:04:34,350
You must be delusional just

106
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:35,828
because we conversed a bit.

107
00:04:35,852 --> 00:04:38,061
You and I are different since birth.

108
00:04:38,086 --> 00:04:39,139
Studying abroad, something

109
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,259
you'd never even dream of,

110
00:04:40,284 --> 00:04:41,392
But someone like me could

111
00:04:41,393 --> 00:04:42,418
just go if I wanted to.

112
00:04:42,442 --> 00:04:43,484
So...

113
00:04:45,278 --> 00:04:46,468
Stop deluding yourself

114
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:48,015
and just get lost.

115
00:05:04,589 --> 00:05:06,362
Suhyeon is coming back to Korea soon.

116
00:05:07,008 --> 00:05:08,134
Hyung. I like you.

117
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,563
I've liked you from the beginning.

118
00:05:18,394 --> 00:05:19,667
When are you free?

119
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:21,122
I have something to say.

120
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:22,340
Let's meet for a bit.

121
00:05:23,775 --> 00:05:25,079
- Professor.
- Professor.

122
00:05:25,735 --> 00:05:28,279
Last time, I noticed you liked lattes...

123
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,448
We went out to buy coffee

124
00:05:30,462 --> 00:05:32,142
and got one for you too.

125
00:05:32,283 --> 00:05:33,534
Oh, you remembered?

126
00:05:34,035 --> 00:05:35,720
- Thanks.
- See you next class!

127
00:05:35,745 --> 00:05:36,751
See you next week.

128
00:05:36,776 --> 00:05:38,681
Sure. Take care.

129
00:05:56,432 --> 00:05:58,768
Is Shin Jaemin the assisant's boyfriend?

130
00:05:59,602 --> 00:06:00,822
If they slept together,

131
00:06:00,847 --> 00:06:02,247
it means they are very close.

132
00:06:03,368 --> 00:06:05,608
Haa... I don't get it at all.

133
00:06:10,238 --> 00:06:11,322
What are you doing?

134
00:06:12,487 --> 00:06:13,495
Is something wrong?

135
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,550
No.

136
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:15,677
Nothing.

137
00:06:15,702 --> 00:06:16,991
No way.

138
00:06:17,016 --> 00:06:18,680
Something's up, isn't it?

139
00:06:19,122 --> 00:06:20,654
You can fool ghosts, but you think you

140
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:21,794
can fool this old lady?

141
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,116
Grandma...

142
00:06:26,141 --> 00:06:27,814
This isn't my matter, but...

143
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,166
It's about my friend's cousin's

144
00:06:29,179 --> 00:06:30,632
acquaintance's younger sibling...

145
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:32,322
It seems like the younger sibling

146
00:06:32,343 --> 00:06:33,616
of my acquaintance went to sleep

147
00:06:33,623 --> 00:06:34,612
at the house of a close friend.

148
00:06:34,636 --> 00:06:35,674
Mm.

149
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:37,912
So, does that mean they're dating?

150
00:06:38,461 --> 00:06:39,492
Geez.

151
00:06:39,517 --> 00:06:40,660
Just because of that?

152
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:41,869
Right?

153
00:06:41,894 --> 00:06:43,055
No, right?

154
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,433
Or maybe not?

155
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,120
Could they be dating?

156
00:06:50,737 --> 00:06:52,216
What does the younger sibling of

157
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,649
your friend's relative think

158
00:06:53,656 --> 00:06:55,316
about that person?

159
00:06:56,745 --> 00:06:57,909
Well...

160
00:06:58,369 --> 00:07:00,555
They think of them as just a colleague.

161
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,915
I don't think so.

162
00:07:02,665 --> 00:07:05,266
This old woman thinks they like them.

163
00:07:06,044 --> 00:07:07,294
Am I right?

164
00:07:07,378 --> 00:07:08,784
You like them, don't you?

165
00:07:08,952 --> 00:07:10,745
Grandma! I told you, it's not about me!

166
00:07:12,828 --> 00:07:13,820
Oh!

167
00:07:15,031 --> 00:07:16,257
Welcome.

168
00:07:17,346 --> 00:07:18,410
The fresh cream and

169
00:07:18,444 --> 00:07:19,890
strawberry fresh cream are good.

170
00:07:20,401 --> 00:07:21,764
The moment you start worrying

171
00:07:21,778 --> 00:07:22,804
and overthinking,

172
00:07:22,811 --> 00:07:23,944
it means you like them.

173
00:07:24,103 --> 00:07:26,439
There's no point in worrying alone.

174
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:28,232
Just ask them directly.

175
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,471
Got it?

176
00:07:34,447 --> 00:07:36,616
Seriously, it's not about me.

177
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,958
You still don't look well.

178
00:08:06,215 --> 00:08:07,317
Should I grab you some

179
00:08:07,324 --> 00:08:08,630
porridge on the way back...

180
00:08:36,384 --> 00:08:37,883
When I feel overwhelmed or have

181
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,710
worries I can't talk about,

182
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:41,222
I just cry.

183
00:08:42,265 --> 00:08:44,378
After crying, my heart feels…

184
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:46,310
a little lighter.

185
00:09:23,112 --> 00:09:24,743
(Albi Construction)

186
00:09:29,103 --> 00:09:30,188
Assistant Manager Jung.

187
00:09:30,424 --> 00:09:31,477
I took a first look at

188
00:09:31,491 --> 00:09:33,137
the things you mentioned.

189
00:09:33,161 --> 00:09:34,568
If you review them and finalize,

190
00:09:34,588 --> 00:09:36,014
we can add them to the final list.

191
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,235
Thank you.

192
00:09:41,365 --> 00:09:42,673
I'll review them quickly.

193
00:09:45,453 --> 00:09:46,570
Assistant Manager.

194
00:09:47,663 --> 00:09:49,147
Are you feeling better?

195
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,372
Yes.

196
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:53,033
Thanks to you, Assistant Manager Ju.

197
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:56,508
Thank you very much for yesterday.

198
00:09:58,633 --> 00:10:00,078
It's nothing.

199
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,076
- You see...
- Wow.

200
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,676
I heard the resort construction project

201
00:10:03,701 --> 00:10:05,378
is something the chairman
is very invested in

202
00:10:05,431 --> 00:10:06,895
and now the Department Director

203
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:07,915
is joining too.

204
00:10:09,644 --> 00:10:11,464
It was posted on the bulletin board.

205
00:10:23,803 --> 00:10:26,302
(Project Leader: Kim Suhyeon
Members: Assistant Jung Daon, Ju Seonghyeon)

206
00:10:28,617 --> 00:10:30,119
Assistant Manager Jung.

207
00:10:30,144 --> 00:10:31,729
Did you know about this...

208
00:10:32,896 --> 00:10:34,022
At this point, don't you

209
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:35,262
have a duty to report it?

210
00:10:35,985 --> 00:10:37,006
Let's do well,

211
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:38,359
Assistant Manager Jung Daon.

212
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:55,064
Assistant Manager.

213
00:10:55,606 --> 00:10:57,305
Can I ask you something?

214
00:10:58,359 --> 00:10:59,465
What is your relationship

215
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,879
with the Department Director?

216
00:11:01,363 --> 00:11:02,911
Yesterday, it seemed like you knew

217
00:11:02,925 --> 00:11:03,958
each other from before.

218
00:11:04,253 --> 00:11:05,862
And now that we're all in the same team,

219
00:11:06,575 --> 00:11:07,702
I think I should know.

220
00:11:10,121 --> 00:11:11,580
We knew each other in university.

221
00:11:12,915 --> 00:11:14,040
In university?

222
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:15,762
We don't have a great

223
00:11:15,782 --> 00:11:17,008
relationship now, though.

224
00:11:18,087 --> 00:11:19,266
Ah...

225
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,406
I see.

226
00:11:22,008 --> 00:11:23,273
Is that what you wanted to know?

227
00:11:23,301 --> 00:11:24,445
Huh?

228
00:11:26,515 --> 00:11:27,518
Yes.

229
00:11:27,543 --> 00:11:28,623
If you're ever curious

230
00:11:28,648 --> 00:11:29,788
about anything, just ask.

231
00:11:30,286 --> 00:11:31,786
I'm happy to answer.

232
00:11:31,856 --> 00:11:32,868
Okay.

233
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:34,102
Understood.

234
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,577
I have to go for a meeting now.

235
00:11:57,043 --> 00:11:59,045
What exactly happened before...

236
00:12:13,068 --> 00:12:14,987
Wherever you go, whatever you do,

237
00:12:15,144 --> 00:12:16,312
I told you to report it, didn't I?

238
00:12:16,312 --> 00:12:17,421
I think I told you there

239
00:12:17,448 --> 00:12:18,487
was no reason to.

240
00:12:19,231 --> 00:12:20,447
- Get in.
- No.

241
00:12:20,472 --> 00:12:22,489
- Get in.
- I said no.

242
00:12:23,778 --> 00:12:24,927
Assistant Manager Jung!

243
00:12:27,031 --> 00:12:28,200
What are you doing here?

244
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:31,359
Didn't you say you had an appointment?

245
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:32,907
- Huh?
- You said we were heading in

246
00:12:32,931 --> 00:12:34,219
the same direction, let's go together.

247
00:12:34,413 --> 00:12:35,561
Let's hurry up and go.

248
00:12:36,415 --> 00:12:37,641
You jerk, what's with you?

249
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,092
I'm Ju Seonghyeon from

250
00:12:40,112 --> 00:12:41,592
the Strategic Planning Division.

251
00:12:42,213 --> 00:12:43,416
Huh?

252
00:12:43,441 --> 00:12:44,856
I've also joined the task force for

253
00:12:44,881 --> 00:12:46,192
the resort construction project.

254
00:12:46,218 --> 00:12:47,553
It's nice to meet you here.

255
00:12:47,593 --> 00:12:49,202
Since it's almost time to leave work,

256
00:12:49,261 --> 00:12:51,597
we'll be heading out now.

257
00:12:52,469 --> 00:12:53,664
Let's go.

258
00:13:07,683 --> 00:13:08,843
Please don't do something

259
00:13:08,857 --> 00:13:09,758
like that again.

260
00:13:09,782 --> 00:13:10,938
I'm sorry.

261
00:13:11,406 --> 00:13:12,906
You looked uncomfortable.

262
00:13:13,702 --> 00:13:14,733
If it made you feel bad,

263
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,260
I sincerely apologize.

264
00:13:17,456 --> 00:13:19,002
It's not that I felt bad.

265
00:13:20,793 --> 00:13:21,999
I was just worried it might

266
00:13:22,024 --> 00:13:23,073
cause trouble for you.

267
00:13:25,031 --> 00:13:26,341
But...

268
00:13:26,382 --> 00:13:28,289
Did I say I had an appointment today?

269
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,363
Uh... Yes!

270
00:13:30,678 --> 00:13:32,013
You have an appointment.

271
00:13:33,003 --> 00:13:34,237
What appointment?

272
00:13:34,515 --> 00:13:36,124
The one to watch a movie with me.

273
00:13:36,767 --> 00:13:37,875
Let's watch today instead

274
00:13:37,895 --> 00:13:38,895
of on the weekend.

275
00:13:40,438 --> 00:13:41,523
Ah...

276
00:13:42,356 --> 00:13:43,457
A movie...

277
00:13:51,323 --> 00:13:53,066
We knew each other in university.

278
00:13:53,242 --> 00:13:54,143
We don't have a great

279
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:54,970
relationship now, though.

280
00:13:54,994 --> 00:13:56,387
- No.
- Get in.

281
00:13:56,412 --> 00:13:57,685
- I said no.

282
00:13:57,955 --> 00:13:58,981
Did you stay at

283
00:13:58,995 --> 00:14:00,368
Shin Jaemin's place yesterday?

284
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,734
We might have to wait a bit.

285
00:14:06,338 --> 00:14:07,822
Then should we sit and wait?

286
00:14:23,397 --> 00:14:24,755
Wow.

287
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,208
It's been a while since I watched

288
00:14:26,216 --> 00:14:27,544
a horror movie in a theater.

289
00:14:27,568 --> 00:14:28,919
What about you?

290
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:31,739
For me, it's been a few months.

291
00:14:33,491 --> 00:14:34,607
I heard the reviews say

292
00:14:34,632 --> 00:14:35,745
this one is terrifying.

293
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:38,453
If you get scared, you can

294
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,939
scream as much as you want.

295
00:14:40,539 --> 00:14:41,968
I don't scream.

296
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,085
I just lean on the person next to me.

297
00:14:44,335 --> 00:14:45,467
Huh?

298
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,501
Not that I'm saying

299
00:14:47,522 --> 00:14:48,868
I'll lean on you or anything.

300
00:14:49,477 --> 00:14:51,132
Since you're already in a relationship,

301
00:14:51,145 --> 00:14:52,861
I shouldn't cause any misunderstandings.

302
00:14:52,885 --> 00:14:54,186
In a relationship?

303
00:14:55,554 --> 00:14:56,710
Just...

304
00:14:57,676 --> 00:14:59,090
I thought you had one.

305
00:15:02,561 --> 00:15:03,693
Oh...

306
00:15:04,522 --> 00:15:05,826
I don't have a lover.

307
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:08,514
Shall we get up now?

308
00:15:09,813 --> 00:15:11,055
Yes.

309
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,168
When watching a movie,

310
00:15:37,188 --> 00:15:38,474
you're supposed to turn it off.

311
00:15:47,565 --> 00:15:49,075
Can I hold your hand?

312
00:15:52,423 --> 00:15:54,216
If you're not seeing anyone right now,

313
00:15:54,989 --> 00:15:56,630
can I hold your hand?

314
00:16:24,852 --> 00:16:26,395
Unable to connect. Please leave

315
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,081
a voice message after the tone...

316
00:16:28,105 --> 00:16:29,635
I'll wait in front of your house until

317
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:31,182
you come back, just so you know.

318
00:16:37,281 --> 00:16:38,782
I should have gone with him earlier.

319
00:16:42,497 --> 00:16:43,974
(Jung Daon (35))

320
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,929
Yes, Department Director.

321
00:16:49,124 --> 00:16:50,675
Strategic Planning Team's Ju Seonghyeon,

322
00:16:51,295 --> 00:16:53,011
find out who that bastard is.

323
00:16:59,011 --> 00:17:01,128
I think I'll have to take the subway.

324
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:03,365
What about you, Assistant Manager Ju?

325
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,521
The subway?

326
00:17:04,975 --> 00:17:06,889
Isn't your house on this side?

327
00:17:07,353 --> 00:17:08,399
Umm...

328
00:17:09,772 --> 00:17:10,860
Today...

329
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,896
I think I'll have to stay out.

330
00:17:13,317 --> 00:17:14,357
Is it because of the

331
00:17:14,382 --> 00:17:15,462
Department Director?

332
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,757
Why do you have to go that far?

333
00:17:18,947 --> 00:17:20,142
It's fine.

334
00:17:20,686 --> 00:17:22,326
I'll just stay at a hotel for tonight.

335
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:27,026
I don't think you should do that.

336
00:17:27,331 --> 00:17:29,299
Why don't you come to my place?

337
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:31,133
Your place, Assistant Manager Ju?

338
00:17:31,225 --> 00:17:33,352
There aren't any hotels nearby anyway.

339
00:17:33,377 --> 00:17:34,496
It's dangerous for you to

340
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,774
go home alone tomorrow.

341
00:17:35,798 --> 00:17:37,349
"If you're okay with it, I don't mind

342
00:17:37,363 --> 00:17:38,609
you staying at my place.

343
00:17:41,136 --> 00:17:43,266
I appreciate it,

344
00:17:44,515 --> 00:17:46,158
- but...
- No.

345
00:17:46,183 --> 00:17:47,559
I really don't mind.

346
00:17:49,776 --> 00:17:51,110
I seriously don't mind.

347
00:17:51,855 --> 00:17:52,862
Please.

348
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,331
Then...

349
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,873
Would it be okay if

350
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,925
I stayed just for tonight?

351
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,746
Of course! Absolutely!

352
00:18:25,832 --> 00:18:27,519
You can sleep here.

353
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,852
Thanks for today, too.

354
00:18:50,831 --> 00:18:52,207
With you, Assistant Manager Ju,

355
00:18:54,126 --> 00:18:55,299
It feels like I always have

356
00:18:55,313 --> 00:18:56,479
things to be thankful for.

357
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:57,667
It's nothing.

358
00:18:58,213 --> 00:18:59,449
And you don't have to

359
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,070
thank me every time.

360
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,284
I'm helping because I want to.

361
00:19:06,951 --> 00:19:08,232
Still...

362
00:19:10,017 --> 00:19:11,050
It wouldn't be right

363
00:19:11,057 --> 00:19:12,303
to just keep receiving.

364
00:19:14,021 --> 00:19:15,773
For Assistant Manager Jung, always.

365
00:19:17,191 --> 00:19:18,593
I'm giving without expecting

366
00:19:18,613 --> 00:19:20,013
anything in return.

367
00:19:21,195 --> 00:19:23,417
You can always be on the receiving end.

368
00:19:27,576 --> 00:19:28,902
You don't help someone

369
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,430
just to be repaid.

370
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,525
Why...

371
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,862
Why are you so good to me?

372
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:38,817
Good question.

373
00:19:40,005 --> 00:19:41,444
I don't know why I'm being nice

374
00:19:41,469 --> 00:19:43,075
to Assistant Manager Jung.

375
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:47,262
I just keep looking at you,

376
00:19:48,847 --> 00:19:50,140
caring for you,

377
00:19:51,571 --> 00:19:52,641
and think...

378
00:21:18,788 --> 00:21:19,928
Here, eat.

379
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,124
How is it?

380
00:21:45,297 --> 00:21:46,397
It's good.

381
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,216
But, uh...

382
00:21:50,469 --> 00:21:51,664
Never mind.

383
00:21:54,389 --> 00:21:55,750
What are you doing today?

384
00:21:55,974 --> 00:21:57,659
I'm meeting my younger sibling
in the evening.

385
00:21:57,684 --> 00:21:58,883
You have a sibling?

386
00:21:59,269 --> 00:22:00,715
I actually have two younger brothers

387
00:22:00,742 --> 00:22:01,785
and one younger sister.

388
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,311
But today I'm meeting my younger sister.

389
00:22:03,565 --> 00:22:05,918
Wow, you have a lot of siblings.

390
00:22:05,943 --> 00:22:07,336
I'm jealous.

391
00:22:07,361 --> 00:22:09,154
Introduce me to them sometime.

392
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:11,662
- Huh?
- I grew up alone and felt very lonely.

393
00:22:11,687 --> 00:22:13,600
So having siblings was always my dream.

394
00:22:14,785 --> 00:22:16,578
Ah... Okay.

395
00:22:17,746 --> 00:22:18,991
I'll introduce you next time

396
00:22:19,012 --> 00:22:20,071
if there's a chance.

397
00:22:29,216 --> 00:22:30,627
Unable to connect. Please leave

398
00:22:30,654 --> 00:22:31,918
a voice message after the tone...

399
00:22:31,942 --> 00:22:33,303
(Jung Daon (67))
Damn it...

400
00:22:36,734 --> 00:22:38,008
(Shin Jaemin)

401
00:22:42,521 --> 00:22:45,122
Unable to connect..

402
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,263
Manager even danced, you know?

403
00:22:57,703 --> 00:22:59,287
You should've come to that day.

404
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:01,681
I'll make sure to come next time.

405
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:03,665
Are you good with alcohol?

406
00:23:08,213 --> 00:23:09,392
Two drinks.

407
00:23:09,631 --> 00:23:11,228
Two drinks are my limit.

408
00:23:12,509 --> 00:23:13,615
So have you always lived

409
00:23:13,629 --> 00:23:15,309
in this neighborhood?

410
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:17,072
No.

411
00:23:17,097 --> 00:23:18,665
I used to live in Mujundong.

412
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,690
I moved here when

413
00:23:19,723 --> 00:23:20,952
I started living on my own.

414
00:23:20,976 --> 00:23:22,060
Oh...

415
00:23:22,936 --> 00:23:24,162
But,

416
00:23:24,187 --> 00:23:25,872
don't you feel lonely living alone?

417
00:23:25,897 --> 00:23:27,691
I haven't been living alone for long,

418
00:23:27,691 --> 00:23:28,984
so I get really lonely.

419
00:23:29,985 --> 00:23:31,261
Sometimes it's lonely...

420
00:23:31,528 --> 00:23:32,917
But it's also comfortable.

421
00:23:34,197 --> 00:23:35,395
I moved out because I didn't

422
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,482
want to stay at home.

423
00:23:39,536 --> 00:23:40,793
But

424
00:23:41,288 --> 00:23:42,406
there was one good thing

425
00:23:42,413 --> 00:23:43,446
about living there.

426
00:23:45,176 --> 00:23:47,294
Whenever I feel uneasy,

427
00:23:47,294 --> 00:23:48,414
there is this hill

428
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,500
I used to go up often.

429
00:23:51,188 --> 00:23:52,447
That place

430
00:23:52,966 --> 00:23:54,301
feels like a refuge.

431
00:23:58,195 --> 00:23:59,312
We're here.

432
00:24:00,891 --> 00:24:01,884
He might be waiting

433
00:24:01,904 --> 00:24:02,994
in front of your room.

434
00:24:03,019 --> 00:24:04,812
I'll walk you to the elevator.

435
00:24:06,897 --> 00:24:08,139
Okay.

436
00:24:21,912 --> 00:24:23,139
Are you relieved now?

437
00:24:23,413 --> 00:24:24,431
Yes.

438
00:24:24,456 --> 00:24:25,608
Get some good rest.

439
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:27,501
Thanks for walking me here...

440
00:24:27,501 --> 00:24:29,503
I told you, you don't have to thank me.

441
00:24:30,212 --> 00:24:31,258
Got it.

442
00:24:31,713 --> 00:24:33,063
Then, I'll get going.

443
00:24:34,132 --> 00:24:35,282
Umm... Assistant Manager.

444
00:24:39,304 --> 00:24:40,413
No, it's nothing.

445
00:24:41,067 --> 00:24:42,285
Please go inside.

446
00:25:11,837 --> 00:25:13,355
What do you think you're doing?

447
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,653
Are you alone?

448
00:25:14,678 --> 00:25:16,120
Can't you tell just by looking?

449
00:25:16,472 --> 00:25:17,558
Then where the hell has

450
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:19,016
this bastard been all this time...

451
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:30,330
What is it so early in the morning?

452
00:25:32,023 --> 00:25:33,437
You said you had something to say.

453
00:25:34,609 --> 00:25:36,609
This is the only time I have.

454
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,702
Oh.

455
00:25:39,226 --> 00:25:40,513
I was just curious about when

456
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,813
you're going back to the U.S.

457
00:25:43,051 --> 00:25:45,027
- That's it?
- Isn't it about time

458
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:46,580
you started heading back?

459
00:25:46,955 --> 00:25:48,290
Once you come back,

460
00:25:49,332 --> 00:25:50,709
it's a hassle to leave again.

461
00:25:52,502 --> 00:25:54,036
Maybe I should continue staying here.

462
00:25:58,706 --> 00:25:59,885
Why are you looking at me

463
00:25:59,899 --> 00:26:01,172
like you want to kill me?

464
00:26:02,137 --> 00:26:03,069
You're scaring me,

465
00:26:03,089 --> 00:26:04,073
I can't even joke around..

466
00:26:04,099 --> 00:26:05,567
I have no intention of playing along

467
00:26:05,573 --> 00:26:06,533
with your jokes.

468
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:08,027
From now on, let's set appointments

469
00:26:08,035 --> 00:26:09,162
beforehand when we meet.

470
00:26:09,186 --> 00:26:11,020
So I won't feel tired first thing
in the morning.

471
00:26:11,045 --> 00:26:12,349
I told you.

472
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,399
This was the only time I had.

473
00:26:19,738 --> 00:26:20,739
I'm leaving.

474
00:26:24,409 --> 00:26:25,571
You do remember our contract

475
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:26,604
is still valid, right?

476
00:26:30,157 --> 00:26:31,735
It seemed like you might've forgotten.

477
00:26:34,878 --> 00:26:36,065
How could I forget who

478
00:26:36,963 --> 00:26:38,173
I made that contract with?

479
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,191
What a relief.

480
00:26:40,592 --> 00:26:41,808
At least you're not stupid.

481
00:26:48,141 --> 00:26:49,443
Quit smoking.

482
00:26:50,044 --> 00:26:51,212
Babe.

483
00:27:11,581 --> 00:27:12,679
Then where the hell has

484
00:27:12,706 --> 00:27:14,085
this bastard been all this time...

485
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,672
Is he here to find Daon?

486
00:27:39,234 --> 00:27:40,627
Yes, Mother.

487
00:27:40,652 --> 00:27:41,835
It's me.

488
00:27:42,362 --> 00:27:45,010
It's just that I can't reach Suhyeon.

489
00:27:46,146 --> 00:27:47,981
He's going back to the U.S. soon,

490
00:27:48,006 --> 00:27:49,192
but I was worried he might

491
00:27:49,206 --> 00:27:50,379
cause some trouble...

492
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,376
Huh?

493
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,642
Oh.

494
00:28:00,461 --> 00:28:01,705
I see.

495
00:28:05,093 --> 00:28:06,311
Understood.

496
00:28:20,317 --> 00:28:21,515
Why is saying "I like you"

497
00:28:21,536 --> 00:28:22,689
such a big deal?

498
00:29:07,044 --> 00:29:08,044
(Kim Suhyeon)

499
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:11,650
(Shin Jaemin)

500
00:29:49,447 --> 00:29:50,907
Are you messing with me right now?

501
00:29:51,282 --> 00:29:52,509
What are you talking about?

502
00:29:52,534 --> 00:29:53,815
What's this about you being the

503
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,475
Department Director
of Albi Construction?

504
00:29:57,455 --> 00:30:00,183
It's my company! What's the problem?

505
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:01,601
The company isn't the problem,

506
00:30:01,608 --> 00:30:02,888
Jung Daon is!

507
00:30:04,462 --> 00:30:05,712
You...

508
00:30:06,506 --> 00:30:07,639
I told you clearly that

509
00:30:07,646 --> 00:30:08,901
the contract is still valid.

510
00:30:08,925 --> 00:30:10,468
Contract, contract, contract.

511
00:30:10,468 --> 00:30:12,345
Dammit, I know!

512
00:30:13,763 --> 00:30:15,118
That shitty contract where we

513
00:30:15,138 --> 00:30:16,261
pretend to be together

514
00:30:16,285 --> 00:30:17,471
only in front of Jung Daon.

515
00:30:17,478 --> 00:30:19,158
I remember it, alright?

516
00:30:22,371 --> 00:30:25,135
(7 years ago)

517
00:30:26,776 --> 00:30:28,253
You like Jung Daon, don't you?

518
00:30:28,278 --> 00:30:29,941
What does that have to do with you?

519
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,512
Date me

520
00:30:33,408 --> 00:30:34,634
but only in front of Daon.

521
00:30:35,663 --> 00:30:36,949
You're insane.

522
00:30:37,812 --> 00:30:39,409
Why the hell would I do that with you?

523
00:30:42,744 --> 00:30:44,285
If you do that for me,

524
00:30:45,378 --> 00:30:46,880
then I won't date Daon either.

525
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,560
I promise.

526
00:30:56,222 --> 00:30:57,526
Because of that shitty contract,

527
00:30:57,551 --> 00:30:58,955
I've been acting like a damn fool,

528
00:30:58,975 --> 00:31:00,119
unable to do anything.

529
00:31:00,143 --> 00:31:01,452
I can't even express how I feel.

530
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:02,580
I just keep my mouth shut
and live like this.

531
00:31:02,604 --> 00:31:03,897
Isn't that enough?

532
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,154
Assistant Manager Ju,

533
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:23,301
what brings you here?

534
00:31:23,458 --> 00:31:24,583
Assistant Manager.

535
00:31:30,173 --> 00:31:32,258
I think I like you.

536
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,122
No.

537
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:39,307
I like you.

538
00:32:04,082 --> 00:32:05,423
Hyung.

539
00:32:05,776 --> 00:32:07,528
What are you doing this evening?

540
00:32:09,212 --> 00:32:10,964
Going out drinking again?

541
00:32:11,548 --> 00:32:12,632
In the evening?

542
00:32:13,925 --> 00:32:15,034
It's a secret.

543
00:32:16,511 --> 00:32:17,823
It's always a secret with you.

544
00:32:19,222 --> 00:32:20,765
Why do you have so many secrets?

545
00:32:22,433 --> 00:32:24,487
So you'll stay curious about me.

546
00:32:26,104 --> 00:32:27,296
Forget it.

547
00:32:28,356 --> 00:32:29,702
Just stop drinking and meeting

548
00:32:29,723 --> 00:32:30,956
random people all the time.

549
00:32:31,277 --> 00:32:32,606
If I stop, then what?

550
00:32:33,486 --> 00:32:35,035
Will you go out with me instead?

551
00:32:35,928 --> 00:32:37,407
Stop joking around.

552
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,770
You keep doing this,

553
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,580
Jaemin hyung will be sad.

554
00:32:53,923 --> 00:32:56,301
I really hope you two last a long time.

555
00:32:57,802 --> 00:32:59,095
So please, stop doing things like that.

556
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,379
Hey, Jung Daon.

557
00:33:01,431 --> 00:33:02,465
Don't say things

558
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:03,559
you don't actually mean.

559
00:33:06,019 --> 00:33:07,107
That's exactly why

560
00:33:07,127 --> 00:33:08,693
people treat you like an idiot.

561
00:33:25,538 --> 00:33:26,776
Let go of me!

562
00:33:27,874 --> 00:33:29,050
I said let go.

563
00:33:31,461 --> 00:33:33,046
Hey, stop messing with Daon already.

564
00:33:34,005 --> 00:33:35,245
Hyung, I looked into what

565
00:33:35,265 --> 00:33:37,026
you helped me with last time.

566
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:38,075
The thesis that you said

567
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:39,111
the professor liked,

568
00:33:39,135 --> 00:33:40,181
