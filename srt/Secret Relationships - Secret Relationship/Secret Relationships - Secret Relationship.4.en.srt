1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:02,037
Because of that shitty contract,

2
00:00:02,062 --> 00:00:03,515
I've been acting like a damn fool,

3
00:00:03,531 --> 00:00:04,724
unable to do anything.

4
00:00:04,748 --> 00:00:05,801
I can't even express how I feel.

5
00:00:05,826 --> 00:00:07,208
I just keep my mouth shut
and live like this.

6
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:08,501
Isn't that enough?

7
00:00:08,793 --> 00:00:10,045
Isn't that enough? You said?

8
00:00:11,087 --> 00:00:12,258
Not at all.

9
00:00:12,964 --> 00:00:14,245
If you were going to leave,

10
00:00:14,253 --> 00:00:15,568
you should've stayed gone for good.

11
00:00:15,592 --> 00:00:17,128
Instead of pulling that crap about

12
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,487
becoming the Department Director.

13
00:00:18,511 --> 00:00:19,596
Now that I think about it,

14
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:21,581
this whole thing feels like a game

15
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:23,034
that's way too unfair for me.

16
00:00:23,058 --> 00:00:24,268
What?

17
00:00:24,434 --> 00:00:26,066
You get to be right next to him,

18
00:00:26,091 --> 00:00:27,771
but I can't even go near?

19
00:00:29,356 --> 00:00:31,316
That doesn't seem fair.

20
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:33,568
Fair?

21
00:00:36,655 --> 00:00:38,428
I was the one who had him all to myself,

22
00:00:38,444 --> 00:00:40,217
but I went out of my way to share.

23
00:00:41,576 --> 00:00:43,495
And now you dare talk about fairness?

24
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:45,782
Guess you must be feeling scared.

25
00:00:47,832 --> 00:00:49,277
The way you're whining like

26
00:00:49,293 --> 00:00:50,980

(7 years ago)

30
00:01:11,883 --> 00:01:13,281
You won't date him,

31
00:01:14,484 --> 00:01:15,902
and I won't date him either?

32
00:01:19,893 --> 00:01:21,227
How dare you say that?

33
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,268
Haven't you noticed Daon

34
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:25,791
acting a little strange lately?

35
00:01:28,415 --> 00:01:29,487
He pretends not to see you

36
00:01:29,503 --> 00:01:30,613
when you're right in front of him.

37
00:01:30,638 --> 00:01:31,848
He doesn't answer your calls.

38
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,857
Why do you think that is?

39
00:01:36,297 --> 00:01:37,523
Are you trying to say that

40
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:39,125
has something to do with you?

41
00:01:40,635 --> 00:01:41,760
Yeah.

42
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,802
I made it that way.

43
00:01:44,639 --> 00:01:46,641
I told Daon not to meet you.

44
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:55,070
Hey.

45
00:01:55,984 --> 00:01:57,405
There is no need to go that far.

46
00:01:58,486 --> 00:01:59,892
Daon seems to like you too,

47
00:01:59,908 --> 00:02:01,868
why don't you two just get together?

48
00:02:02,073 --> 00:02:03,704
Stop dragging me into this and

49
00:02:03,736 --> 00:02:05,001
making me miserable.

50
00:02:05,827 --> 00:02:07,526
Just be with each other already.

51
00:02:10,123 --> 00:02:11,291
Would you really be okay?

52
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:14,043
You like Daon too, right?

53
00:02:25,263 --> 00:02:26,350
I want to have Daon

54
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:27,733
in my life for a long time.

55
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,889
I don't want to date him

56
00:02:29,905 --> 00:02:31,038
and then break up.

57
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,361
I want to keep him by my side forever.

58
00:02:35,273 --> 00:02:36,566
That's why I'm proposing a contract.

59
00:02:38,443 --> 00:02:40,044
This is the only way I can keep

60
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,341
Daon in my life forever.

61
00:02:42,322 --> 00:02:43,615
Are you seriously insane?

62
00:02:45,825 --> 00:02:47,243
I'll ask you one last time.

63
00:02:48,828 --> 00:02:50,330
Would you rather stay by Daon's side

64
00:02:51,581 --> 00:02:52,956
by this method

65
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:55,096
or no?

66
00:02:59,088 --> 00:03:00,423
I'll take that as a yes.

67
00:03:39,712 --> 00:03:41,196
I told you to go on arranged dates,

68
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,233
why didn't you go?

69
00:03:42,257 --> 00:03:43,633
Are you still going out hunting?

70
00:03:44,778 --> 00:03:46,427
You're getting older,

71
00:03:46,427 --> 00:03:48,106
don't push yourself too hard.

72
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:55,770
I've been busy.

73
00:03:57,021 --> 00:03:58,864
As you may have heard, we're getting

74
00:03:58,896 --> 00:04:00,584
into the resort construction business.

75
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:02,151
So I've been busy.

76
00:04:02,151 --> 00:04:03,236
What?

77
00:04:04,696 --> 00:04:05,854
I'll go.

78
00:04:06,531 --> 00:04:07,907
I'll see the arranged dates.

79
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:10,393
Winning a bid for a resort

80
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:12,111
construction project isn't easy.

81
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,538
Keep your head on straight.

82
00:04:14,038 --> 00:04:15,623
If you want to take over the company,

83
00:04:15,647 --> 00:04:17,059
start by looking at those matches.

84
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,393
Got it?

85
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:19,660
If you're done talking,

86
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:20,730
I'll be going now.

87
00:04:21,921 --> 00:04:23,298
I still don't get you.

88
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:26,035
A guy who only caused trouble

89
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:27,361
and never cared about management

90
00:04:27,385 --> 00:04:28,675
why does he suddenly want

91
00:04:28,692 --> 00:04:29,905
to take over the company?

92
00:04:29,929 --> 00:04:31,306
What are you scheming?

93
00:04:32,891 --> 00:04:34,517
(2 years ago. The United States)
I put a document on your desk.

94
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,402
It's about the U.S. branch
hotel project.

95
00:04:37,427 --> 00:04:38,763
Review it and make sure

96
00:04:38,788 --> 00:04:40,022
to change Dad's mind.

(Jung Daon)

101
00:04:58,833 --> 00:04:59,834
I've become greedy.

102
00:05:00,877 --> 00:05:03,922
You've become greedy.

103
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:08,455
Then prove it.

104
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,533
Prove that you deserve

105
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,275
to take over the company.

106
00:05:17,727 --> 00:05:18,992
I will.

107
00:05:21,099 --> 00:05:22,561
I'll give it everything I have.

108
00:05:23,721 --> 00:05:26,015
Well, more than anyone, I know

109
00:05:26,903 --> 00:05:28,488
that you're not an easy man to please.

110
00:05:33,201 --> 00:05:34,388
Is that so?

111
00:05:35,244 --> 00:05:36,371
We'll see, then.

112
00:05:37,163 --> 00:05:38,656
You know there's a meeting with

113
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:40,168
Pilgang Industries next week, right?

114
00:05:40,193 --> 00:05:41,737
You go in place of the vice president.

115
00:05:42,085 --> 00:05:43,210
Yes.

116
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,959
Don't worry.

117
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,150
I like you.

118
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:10,756
You don't have to answer.

119
00:06:11,864 --> 00:06:12,918
I just...

120
00:06:14,492 --> 00:06:16,168
wanted to tell you how I feel.

121
00:06:21,207 --> 00:06:22,475
I'll get going first.

122
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,792
Please go inside and rest.

123
00:06:39,684 --> 00:06:40,935
Hyung, I like you.

124
00:06:41,102 --> 00:06:42,645
Why do you keep crossing the line?

125
00:06:42,645 --> 00:06:44,012
You're sharp,

126
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:46,410
know how to seek benefits,

127
00:06:46,524 --> 00:06:47,949
but why are you being so stupid?

128
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:50,903

It's me, Geunho.

132
00:07:09,964 --> 00:07:11,276
What's up all of a sudden?

133
00:07:11,424 --> 00:07:12,592
Ah, nothing much.

134
00:07:12,592 --> 00:07:14,819
We're meeting up with the guys
next Monday.

135
00:07:14,844 --> 00:07:15,987
Next Monday?

136
00:07:16,012 --> 00:07:17,142
Yeah, if you're free,

137
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:18,325
you should come too.

138
00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:19,693
Jaemin hyung is coming too.

139
00:07:24,437 --> 00:07:25,663
I don't think I can make it.

140
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:26,707
I already have plans.

141
00:07:26,749 --> 00:07:28,137
Plans?

142
00:07:28,232 --> 00:07:29,942
It's been so long since
we all got together.

143
00:07:29,967 --> 00:07:31,035
Sorry.

144
00:07:31,903 --> 00:07:33,051
Let's meet next time.

145
00:07:42,747 --> 00:07:44,036
Brother, we're meeting

146
00:07:44,044 --> 00:07:45,129
at 7 o'clock, right?

147
00:07:53,549 --> 00:07:54,927
Thank you for the meal.

148
00:08:04,114 --> 00:08:05,505
Had I known, I should have

149
00:08:05,728 --> 00:08:08,022
just told Dad where you live.

150
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,205
Then Dad wouldn't have borrowed money

151
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,892
from brother Jaemin.

152
00:08:13,736 --> 00:08:15,431
That's already been taken care of.

153
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,864
Don't worry about it.

154
00:08:18,908 --> 00:08:20,284
To be honest...

155
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,181
I hate Dad for being addicted

156
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:23,275
to gambling and

157
00:08:23,306 --> 00:08:24,393
borrowing money everywhere.

158
00:08:24,418 --> 00:08:26,009
But I don't understand brother Jaemin

159
00:08:26,017 --> 00:08:27,101
for lending him money,

160
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,486
knowing full well it's just

161
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,626
going to gambling.

162
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:31,879
Still, if it weren't for him,

163
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,339
we would've had a harder time.

164
00:08:35,091 --> 00:08:36,591
But when I think about it,

165
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:38,694
even though he helped us,

166
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,540
it doesn't solve any problems.

167
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:43,391
I just ended up feeling more indebted.

168
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:46,340
Don't you feel the same?

169
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,697
Are you studying hard?

170
00:08:58,239 --> 00:08:59,499
Once you start preparing for
university entrance exams,

171
00:08:59,524 --> 00:09:00,942
your senior year will fly by...

172
00:09:01,617 --> 00:09:03,132
I'm not going to university.

173
00:09:04,871 --> 00:09:06,472
University is a waste of money.

174
00:09:06,497 --> 00:09:08,312
I'm going to get a job and
start earning money right away.

175
00:09:08,337 --> 00:09:09,551
What are you talking about?

176
00:09:09,876 --> 00:09:10,911
Going to college is more

177
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,020
important than making money.

178
00:09:12,044 --> 00:09:13,187
No.

179
00:09:13,212 --> 00:09:14,962
For me, earning money quickly and

180
00:09:14,978 --> 00:09:16,942
becoming independent is more important.

181
00:09:16,966 --> 00:09:19,309
I can't live with Mom and Dad anymore.

182
00:09:22,138 --> 00:09:23,317
Then...

183
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:25,313
Let me live at your place.

184
00:09:25,892 --> 00:09:27,134
Then I'll go to university.

185
00:09:33,107 --> 00:09:34,208
See?

186
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:35,776
You can't do that either.

187
00:09:37,695 --> 00:09:38,713
So...

188
00:09:38,777 --> 00:09:40,528
Don't tell me to go to university.

189
00:09:51,918 --> 00:09:53,794
Are you not going home again today?

190
00:09:57,048 --> 00:09:58,316
Alright.

191
00:09:58,341 --> 00:09:59,477
I'll go.

192
00:10:08,017 --> 00:10:09,310
If you need more, let me know.

193
00:10:11,132 --> 00:10:13,231
I'm fine. I have money.

194
00:10:13,231 --> 00:10:14,507
Could it be that...

195
00:10:16,525 --> 00:10:18,277
You're working part-time, are you?

196
00:10:19,195 --> 00:10:20,671
It's not like that.

197
00:10:20,696 --> 00:10:21,822
Work part-time later.

198
00:10:22,615 --> 00:10:23,824
You're still a student,

199
00:10:24,325 --> 00:10:25,409
just focus on school.

200
00:10:26,244 --> 00:10:27,286
Alright.

201
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,002
Go quickly.

202
00:10:34,877 --> 00:10:36,190
Daon said that?

203
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:38,549
That he can't come?

204
00:10:40,675 --> 00:10:41,801
Well, can't be helped.

205
00:10:43,701 --> 00:10:45,429
- See you next time.
- Next time?

206
00:10:46,555 --> 00:10:48,307
Then, when will you give me
the investment information?

207
00:10:48,307 --> 00:10:49,390
I'll give it to you when

208
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:50,601
we meet next time.

209
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:52,119
It's not urgent, right?

210
00:10:52,144 --> 00:10:53,272
Umm...

211
00:10:54,188 --> 00:10:55,500
- Then...
- Hyung!

212
00:10:55,898 --> 00:10:57,400
I'll ask Daon again.

213
00:10:58,734 --> 00:11:01,124
It'd be best if we all met together.

214
00:11:03,906 --> 00:11:05,299
You want to do that?

215
00:11:05,324 --> 00:11:06,641
Yes.

216
00:11:08,703 --> 00:11:09,954
Alright,

217
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,286
Assistant Manager.

218
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,355
I think I like you.

219
00:11:36,647 --> 00:11:37,810
No,

220
00:11:38,274 --> 00:11:39,567
I like you.

221
00:11:40,484 --> 00:11:41,679
How am I supposed to go

222
00:11:41,687 --> 00:11:42,694
to work tomorrow.

223
00:11:49,827 --> 00:11:51,429
Sorry for bothering you on the weekend.

224
00:11:51,454 --> 00:11:53,296
When you come to work tomorrow,

225
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,444
please check the final list first.

226
00:11:55,712 --> 00:11:57,274
(Lala Bakery)

227
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:00,980
Hey, Grandma!

228
00:12:01,005 --> 00:12:02,700
That was the person from before, right?

229
00:12:03,632 --> 00:12:05,343
How many times do I have to say this?

230
00:12:05,343 --> 00:12:06,512
Just worrying about it

231
00:12:06,528 --> 00:12:07,821
won't give you an answer!

232
00:12:07,845 --> 00:12:09,180
I'll handle it myself.

233
00:12:13,976 --> 00:12:15,328
Understood.

234
00:12:15,353 --> 00:12:16,579
And...

235
00:12:16,604 --> 00:12:18,068
About what I said yesterday,

236
00:12:18,084 --> 00:12:19,553
please don't feel pressured.

237
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:20,953
Thank you.

238
00:12:20,978 --> 00:12:22,334
Have a good weekend, and

239
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:23,928
see you at the office tomorrow.

240
00:12:25,571 --> 00:12:26,881
Yes.

241
00:12:26,906 --> 00:12:27,923
You too, Assistant Manager.

242
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:29,094
Don't tell me that

243
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,835
you already confess and get rejected?

244
00:12:32,161 --> 00:12:33,429
Rejected? No way!

245
00:12:33,454 --> 00:12:34,668
That's not it.

246
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,377
I did confess,

247
00:12:41,754 --> 00:12:43,297
but I told them not to answer.

248
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:45,087
Why?

249
00:12:48,052 --> 00:12:49,261
I'm afraid he'll feel uneasy.

250
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,139
I made a mistake

251
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,308
by confessing to him.

252
00:12:55,476 --> 00:12:57,019
What are you talking about?

253
00:12:58,104 --> 00:12:59,718
How is expressing your feelings

254
00:12:59,749 --> 00:13:00,749
a mistake?

255
00:13:01,524 --> 00:13:02,874
You know they say love is

256
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:04,169
all about timing, right?

257
00:13:04,193 --> 00:13:05,538
In the end, making that

258
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,370
timing happen is up to you.

259
00:13:08,906 --> 00:13:10,616
If you take it slow,

260
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:13,077
someday, that person,

261
00:13:13,577 --> 00:13:16,163
will recognize how great you are.

262
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,044
Welcome.

263
00:13:25,965 --> 00:13:28,509
Yes, this one's really popular.

264
00:13:42,853 --> 00:13:44,150
Ah...

265
00:13:44,358 --> 00:13:45,651
My grandmother is cookies...

266
00:13:45,651 --> 00:13:46,961
No.

267
00:13:46,986 --> 00:13:48,587
She runs a dessert shop.

268
00:13:48,612 --> 00:13:50,156
I thought maybe you'd like some.

269
00:13:51,282 --> 00:13:52,508
Please go ahead and try it.

270
00:13:55,619 --> 00:13:56,969
I'll enjoy it.

271
00:13:58,122 --> 00:13:59,196
Thank you.

272
00:14:08,174 --> 00:14:09,455
Assistant Manager Ju.

273
00:14:11,093 --> 00:14:12,178
I'll buy the coffee.

274
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,058
If you're feeling uncomfortable,

275
00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:20,686
you really don't have to do this.

276
00:14:23,606 --> 00:14:25,543
Buying coffee for a coworker

277
00:14:25,816 --> 00:14:27,234
isn't weird, is it?

278
00:14:27,735 --> 00:14:29,653
Ah... Coworker.

279
00:14:31,301 --> 00:14:33,004
I thought it was because it was awkward.

280
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:34,590
I don't feel awkward.

281
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,661
Do you feel awkward around me?

282
00:14:53,719 --> 00:14:54,776
Like last time

283
00:14:54,792 --> 00:14:56,526
you two seem pretty close.

284
00:14:57,014 --> 00:14:58,224
We're on the same team.

285
00:14:59,183 --> 00:15:00,675
Does being on the same team

286
00:15:00,683 --> 00:15:01,883
make you close?

287
00:15:01,936 --> 00:15:03,062
I'm on the same team too...

288
00:15:03,062 --> 00:15:04,421
Even on the same team,

289
00:15:05,064 --> 00:15:06,732
it depends on the person.

290
00:15:09,235 --> 00:15:10,726
It depends on the person?

291
00:15:11,612 --> 00:15:13,244
If you don't have anything else to say,

292
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,460
we'll be going.

293
00:15:15,407 --> 00:15:16,703
Let's go.

294
00:15:29,432 --> 00:15:35,899
(Albi Construction)

295
00:15:51,068 --> 00:15:52,399
Come to my office. Right now.

296
00:15:52,945 --> 00:15:54,113
Have a coffee with me.

297
00:15:54,113 --> 00:15:55,308
If it's not work-related,

298
00:15:55,324 --> 00:15:56,684
please don't contact me.

299
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:58,331
Then was hanging around with

300
00:15:58,347 --> 00:15:59,863
Ju Seonghyeon for work too?

301
00:16:09,587 --> 00:16:10,838
Right now?

302
00:16:12,047 --> 00:16:15,384
Ah, yes, yes, understood!

303
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,678
Everyone,

304
00:16:17,678 --> 00:16:19,388
to the meeting room immediately!

305
00:16:19,388 --> 00:16:21,640
Manager, we have our
weekly meeting soon.

306
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,192
I don't know, this is from the
Department Director.

307
00:16:23,217 --> 00:16:24,760
Now, hurry, hurry, hurry!

308
00:16:45,093 --> 00:16:47,053
What does the Strategic Planning
Department do?

309
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:49,903
Ah, yes, we establish management plans

310
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:52,480
and promote the company's development...

311
00:16:52,504 --> 00:16:53,839
Development...

312
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,634
But the company isn't progressing.

313
00:16:57,744 --> 00:17:00,413
Ah, am I the only one who thinks that?

314
00:17:02,514 --> 00:17:03,685
If you look at our quarterly

315
00:17:03,694 --> 00:17:05,535
business performance this year,

316
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:07,311
Sales have been steadily increasing...

317
00:17:07,311 --> 00:17:08,937
So what?

318
00:17:09,438 --> 00:17:11,565
Our operating profit keeps dropping.

319
00:17:15,527 --> 00:17:18,739
Is this what Manager Go calls progress?

320
00:17:19,698 --> 00:17:21,659
You can't even properly wrap up
existing projects,

321
00:17:21,659 --> 00:17:23,869
yet you're rushing to start new ones.

322
00:17:26,205 --> 00:17:28,123
What exactly are you all thinking?

323
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,762
Well...

324
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:32,910
There have been some construction

325
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:33,980
delays at certain sites,

326
00:17:34,004 --> 00:17:35,339
So I can understand why

327
00:17:35,364 --> 00:17:36,732
you might think that way.

328
00:17:36,757 --> 00:17:37,800
So,

329
00:17:38,842 --> 00:17:40,903
I'm just worrying for no reason?

330
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:42,554
No, that's not what I meant.

331
00:17:42,554 --> 00:17:44,030
Assistant Manager Jung Daon,

332
00:17:44,046 --> 00:17:45,486
what do you think?

333
00:17:45,742 --> 00:17:46,882
I'd like to hear your

334
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,046
professional opinion.

335
00:17:49,979 --> 00:17:51,563
From an operating profit standpoint,

336
00:17:51,563 --> 00:17:53,357
It may seem weak at the moment,

337
00:17:53,357 --> 00:17:54,747
But with the soon-to-be completed

338
00:17:54,763 --> 00:17:55,800
apartment project,

339
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,192
The upcoming model house launch

340
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,421
for the new city development,

341
00:17:58,445 --> 00:17:59,955
and a few other projects,

342
00:18:00,739 --> 00:18:02,700
Everything will wrap up next year,

343
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,326
So there's no need for concern.

344
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,607
But those projects

345
00:18:05,632 --> 00:18:06,990
could all be losses, right?

346
00:18:07,705 --> 00:18:09,884
They're all highly profitable projects.

347
00:18:09,957 --> 00:18:12,084
Especially the new city
development project.

348
00:18:12,084 --> 00:18:14,183
The model house uses a metaverse system

349
00:18:14,199 --> 00:18:15,464
for real-time viewing,

350
00:18:15,754 --> 00:18:17,261
And it's already drawing a lot

351
00:18:17,286 --> 00:18:18,768
of interest before pre-sales.

352
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:19,900
Is that so? Then

353
00:18:19,925 --> 00:18:21,819
Assistant Manager Ju Seonghyeon,
what do you think?

354
00:18:21,844 --> 00:18:23,112
Huh?

355
00:18:23,137 --> 00:18:24,154
Ah...

356
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:25,757
Was that too tough a question

357
00:18:25,781 --> 00:18:26,781
for someone

358
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,190
who just started working here?

359
00:18:31,103 --> 00:18:32,853
I think you're only looking

360
00:18:32,869 --> 00:18:34,290
at a small portion of the picture.

361
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:36,233
Looking at past years' data,

362
00:18:36,233 --> 00:18:37,475
these projects have been

363
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,586
consistently ongoing,

364
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,373
and though the profits aren't huge,

365
00:18:40,381 --> 00:18:41,756
they've been steadily rising.

366
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,147
I know that, then...

367
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,090
What's your relationship with Jung Daon?

368
00:18:47,786 --> 00:18:49,364
You're always together
whenever I see you.

369
00:18:50,476 --> 00:18:52,450
- Work colleagues...
- We're work colleagues.

370
00:18:53,709 --> 00:18:55,371
We help each other when needed.

371
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,982
You could say we're close.

372
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,864
Close?

373
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:01,609
Yes.

374
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:03,677
Is there a problem with that?

375
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,669
No problem.

376
00:19:09,057 --> 00:19:11,185
Anyway, from the way Jung Daon speaks,

377
00:19:12,186 --> 00:19:13,381
You're really close

378
00:19:13,397 --> 00:19:14,789
as the ace of the
Strategic Planning Department.

379
00:19:14,813 --> 00:19:16,600
Now I understand why you
get so much praise.

380
00:19:18,692 --> 00:19:20,281
Let's have these...

381
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,030
Work-related conversations more often.

382
00:19:30,596 --> 00:19:32,014
Didn't they say it was urgent?

383
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:34,242
Exactly. Over something so trivial.

384
00:19:46,678 --> 00:19:47,906
Are you really not coming?

385
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,782
It'd be nice to all hang out together.

386
00:19:49,807 --> 00:19:50,974
Jaemin hyung's coming too.

387
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:53,494
I have prior plans.

388
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:55,059
What plans?

389
00:19:58,816 --> 00:20:01,030
Everyone, good job today.

390
00:20:01,235 --> 00:20:03,110
You were all pretty flustered, huh?

391
00:20:03,654 --> 00:20:06,281
Things like this happen at work.

392
00:20:06,281 --> 00:20:08,742
But we can't get discouraged every time.

393
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:10,118
Let's just have a drink

394
00:20:10,118 --> 00:20:11,161
and forget about it.

395
00:20:11,829 --> 00:20:13,204
On that note,

396
00:20:13,956 --> 00:20:15,916
we're having a team dinner tonight!

397
00:20:18,502 --> 00:20:20,754
I'll even treat you all to sashimi.

398
00:20:20,754 --> 00:20:22,353
Alright, who can't make it?

399
00:20:22,923 --> 00:20:24,368
Umm...

400
00:20:25,008 --> 00:20:26,840
What, you can't come again?

401
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,204
No.

402
00:20:28,554 --> 00:20:30,436
But how about pork ribs instead?

403
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:33,600
Some people can't eat sashimi.

404
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,590
Fine, pork ribs it is!

405
00:20:36,071 --> 00:20:37,532
See you later.

406
00:20:44,236 --> 00:20:45,337
Team dinner.

407
00:20:52,995 --> 00:20:54,888
- What's over there?
- Huh?

408
00:20:54,913 --> 00:20:56,223
You kept staring.

409
00:20:56,248 --> 00:20:57,495
Oh.

410
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:58,864
It's nothing.

411
00:20:59,042 --> 00:21:00,190
Hey, Assistant Manager Ju.

412
00:21:00,215 --> 00:21:02,146
- Have a drink with me.
- Umm, Manager.

413
00:21:02,171 --> 00:21:03,478
Let me pour for you first.

414
00:21:03,503 --> 00:21:05,257
That's great.

415
00:21:08,427 --> 00:21:09,736
Assistant Manager Ju.

416
00:21:09,761 --> 00:21:11,071
You shouldn't underestimate me.

417
00:21:11,096 --> 00:21:12,639
About the Department Director today,

418
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:13,974
you know, I let him off easy.

419
00:21:14,308 --> 00:21:15,642
Now, cheers.

420
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,748
Why aren't you drinking?

421
00:21:21,773 --> 00:21:23,292
Are you underestimating me?

422
00:21:23,317 --> 00:21:24,443
Umm... Well...

423
00:21:24,443 --> 00:21:26,637
Last time, Assistant Manager Ju said

424
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:28,839
he wasn't very good at drinking.

425
00:21:28,864 --> 00:21:30,073
Ah, come on.

426
00:21:30,073 --> 00:21:31,533
If you keep drinking,

427
00:21:31,557 --> 00:21:33,237
you'll build a tolerance.

428
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:35,058
Don't drink, don't drink.

429
00:21:35,329 --> 00:21:36,763
No.

430
00:21:36,788 --> 00:21:37,890
I'll drink.

431
00:21:37,915 --> 00:21:38,952
Oh!

432
00:21:38,986 --> 00:21:40,212
Then let's drink.

433
00:21:59,603 --> 00:22:00,821
What's this?

434
00:22:01,146 --> 00:22:02,439
Assistant Manager Jung...

435
00:22:03,106 --> 00:22:04,983
Are you helping your teammate?

436
00:22:05,567 --> 00:22:06,801
Yes.

437
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,404
He's my only teammate.

438
00:22:09,905 --> 00:22:10,906
You don't drink with us.

439
00:22:10,906 --> 00:22:12,574
You normally don't drink.

440
00:22:12,574 --> 00:22:13,920
He said he's looking after

441
00:22:13,945 --> 00:22:15,385
his only teammate.

442
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:17,721
Excellent!

443
00:22:17,746 --> 00:22:20,189
Nice atmosphere.

444
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:21,266
I love it.

445
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:23,603
Wow, this feeling of unity.

446
00:22:23,683 --> 00:22:25,053
- Oh, Assistant Manager Jung.
- Yes?

447
00:22:25,078 --> 00:22:26,945
It's been a while since we had a drink

448
00:22:26,961 --> 00:22:28,546
with Assistant Manager Jung.

449
00:22:28,674 --> 00:22:30,842
You're looking after your teammate.

450
00:22:30,842 --> 00:22:33,011
I'll look after the whole team.

451
00:22:33,357 --> 00:22:35,770
Come. Fill your glass.

452
00:22:39,017 --> 00:22:40,919
Wow, thanks to Assistant Manager Jung,

453
00:22:40,935 --> 00:22:42,294
the mood is really lifting!

454
00:22:42,454 --> 00:22:46,023
- Come, Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi!
- Wi-Fi!

455
00:22:46,048 --> 00:22:47,579
I'll take care of my own drink.

456
00:22:47,651 --> 00:22:48,794
It's fine.

457
00:22:48,819 --> 00:22:50,420
Alright, Strategic Planning Team,

458
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:51,436
let's go!

459
00:22:51,697 --> 00:22:52,823
Let's go!

460
00:22:55,296 --> 00:22:56,450
Great.

461
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:58,166
Since we're drinking,
we have to drink it all the way.

462
00:22:58,191 --> 00:23:00,850
- Come on.
- Come on.

463
00:23:06,053 --> 00:23:07,795
Isn't it great?
Let's have another round.

464
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,748
- Come on!
- Come on!

465
00:23:11,484 --> 00:23:13,843
I'm feeling the mood.

466
00:23:14,469 --> 00:23:15,595
Oh dear.

467
00:23:16,077 --> 00:23:17,347
Today...

468
00:23:17,347 --> 00:23:18,643
It's an honor.

469
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:24,089
To be working with Korea's top company.

470
00:23:24,271 --> 00:23:26,060
It would not be an exaggeration to say

471
00:23:26,068 --> 00:23:27,560
that it is an honor to the family.

472
00:23:27,584 --> 00:23:29,151
What are you saying?

473
00:23:29,151 --> 00:23:32,002
We're only meeting like this because
Pilgang is also a great company.

474
00:23:33,613 --> 00:23:35,815
- Well then, let's have a drink to that.
- Sure.

475
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,329
Sorry, I'm late.

476
00:23:41,329 --> 00:23:42,956
I got held up with an urgent call...

477
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,751
This is the employee
who handled the contract.

478
00:23:45,751 --> 00:23:47,141
Introduce yourself.

479
00:23:51,141 --> 00:23:52,233
Nice to meet you.

480
00:23:52,258 --> 00:23:53,899
Team Leader of PR at Pilgang Industries.

481
00:23:53,924 --> 00:23:55,493
I'm Park Junghoon.

482
00:24:14,362 --> 00:24:15,864
Ah, this jerk.

483
00:24:18,116 --> 00:24:19,534
The deal is off.

484
00:24:19,534 --> 00:24:21,203
What? What do you mean?

485
00:24:22,537 --> 00:24:24,334
Ask that bastard over there

486
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:25,866
for the reason.

487
00:24:34,633 --> 00:24:36,218
Hyung, please.

488
00:24:36,243 --> 00:24:37,327
Please, just this once, help me.

489
00:24:38,178 --> 00:24:39,498
If this deal falls through,

490
00:24:39,514 --> 00:24:40,554
I'm finished.

491
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,945
Please, think about it one more time.

492
00:24:45,811 --> 00:24:47,076
I told you never to show up

493
00:24:47,092 --> 00:24:47,914
in front of me again.

494
00:24:47,938 --> 00:24:49,477
If you help me this one time,

495
00:24:49,501 --> 00:24:50,701
I'll disappear.

496
00:24:51,316 --> 00:24:52,943
I'll never show up in front of you
or Daon again...

497
00:24:52,943 --> 00:24:53,944
Do you wanna die?

498
00:24:54,986 --> 00:24:56,611
I told you not to say Jung Daon's name

499
00:24:56,627 --> 00:24:58,228
with that filthy mouth of yours.

500
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,469
Get lost.

501
00:25:11,044 --> 00:25:12,098
If this is because of

502
00:25:12,123 --> 00:25:13,637
what happened back then...

503
00:25:14,381 --> 00:25:17,217
That wasn't me.

504
00:25:18,718 --> 00:25:20,595
I mean I didn't do that of my own will!

505
00:25:23,181 --> 00:25:24,182
I understand.

506
00:25:24,182 --> 00:25:25,267
Going home.

507
00:25:27,811 --> 00:25:29,121
Assistant Manager Ju.

508
00:25:29,146 --> 00:25:30,438
Do you know where
Assistant Manager Jung lives?

509
00:25:30,469 --> 00:25:32,691
- Yes, I do.
- Please take him home. We'll go ahead.

510
00:25:32,716 --> 00:25:34,860
- Alright, I got it.
- Get home safely.

511
00:25:34,885 --> 00:25:36,319
- Get home safe.
- What are you talking about?

512
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:39,739
I will give my loyalty to the director!

513
00:25:42,117 --> 00:25:43,624
Get home safe.

514
00:25:50,795 --> 00:25:52,046
Assistant Manager Jung.

515
00:25:59,467 --> 00:26:01,690
Why did you drink instead of me?

516
00:26:01,841 --> 00:26:03,593
Why do you keep taking care of me?

517
00:26:06,349 --> 00:26:07,976
Because you remind me of myself.

518
00:26:10,478 --> 00:26:12,147
When I look at you,
Assistant Manager Ju,

519
00:26:14,774 --> 00:26:16,276
it feels like I'm looking at myself.

520
00:26:19,905 --> 00:26:21,131
So...

521
00:26:24,117 --> 00:26:26,286
I just want to be good to you.

522
00:26:30,582 --> 00:26:31,583
Assistant Manager Jung.

523
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,058
(Professor, Faculty of Architecture
Shin Jaemin)

524
00:26:43,494 --> 00:26:45,998
(Choi Geunho)

525
00:26:56,149 --> 00:26:57,821
I said to set up meetings in advance.

526
00:26:57,846 --> 00:26:58,873
Why did you do it?

527
00:26:58,898 --> 00:27:00,329
Why did you do that?

528
00:27:00,554 --> 00:27:02,077
Explain it so I can understand.

529
00:27:03,323 --> 00:27:05,367
That bastard Park Junghoon,
what he did to Jung Daon...

530
00:27:05,367 --> 00:27:08,038
I heard you ordered him to do it!

531
00:27:08,203 --> 00:27:09,431
Senior Shin Jaemin

532
00:27:09,788 --> 00:27:11,510
ordered me to do it.

533
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,166
To just get Daon drunk
and take off his clothes...

534
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:15,352
And then contacted him afterward...

535
00:27:15,377 --> 00:27:17,001
He guaranteed nothing would happen.

536
00:27:17,407 --> 00:27:20,298
I just did what I was told.

537
00:27:20,298 --> 00:27:21,341
So please...

538
00:27:22,023 --> 00:27:23,692
Just help me with this deal.

539
00:27:30,976 --> 00:27:32,410
You know this too...

540
00:27:32,435 --> 00:27:33,368
That time,

541
00:27:33,384 --> 00:27:34,735
Daon started to go astray.

542
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,440
What?

543
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,792
He's someone who...

544
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:40,283
Gives hid heart away too easily

545
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:41,768
if someone's just kind to him.

546
00:27:41,898 --> 00:27:43,762
I had to take good care of him.

547
00:27:44,781 --> 00:27:46,340
But it wasn't that easy.

548
00:27:47,575 --> 00:27:48,856
So I had to do it.

549
00:27:49,411 --> 00:27:50,606
You crazy bastard.

550
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:52,622
So forcing me to go study abroad...

551
00:27:52,622 --> 00:27:54,325
Forcing you? It was a suggestion.

552
00:27:55,166 --> 00:27:56,653
And in the end, you're the one

553
00:27:56,661 --> 00:27:57,941
who accepted it.

554
00:27:58,837 --> 00:27:59,965
You were scared

555
00:27:59,973 --> 00:28:01,565
your father would find out...

556
00:28:01,589 --> 00:28:02,981
That you beat someone up

557
00:28:02,989 --> 00:28:04,020
because of Daon.

558
00:28:04,592 --> 00:28:06,329
That's why you ran away.

559
00:28:10,804 --> 00:28:12,765
If you want, go tell Daon.

560
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:15,412
Tell him I ordered Park Junghoon

561
00:28:15,437 --> 00:28:16,960
to do it.

562
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,356
Go ahead and say it.

563
00:28:19,316 --> 00:28:20,550
But...

564
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:25,739
Do you think he'll believe you?

565
00:28:25,764 --> 00:28:28,309
- What the hell are you trying to pull?
- Even if he does believe you...

566
00:28:30,285 --> 00:28:31,911
He wouldn't dare to hate me.

567
00:28:37,834 --> 00:28:39,925
This contract is over now.

568
00:28:40,837 --> 00:28:42,274
From now on, I'll be the one

569
00:28:42,298 --> 00:28:43,571
protecting Jung Daon.

570
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:45,303
So keep that in mind.

571
00:30:09,426 --> 00:30:10,941
Hyung.

572
00:30:21,604 --> 00:30:23,356
Jaemin hyung.

573
00:30:33,074 --> 00:30:34,784
- Okay, cheers!
- Cheers!

574
00:30:34,809 --> 00:30:36,269
Hurry, hurry.

575
00:30:40,016 --> 00:30:43,334
Ah, this is good.

576
00:30:49,757 --> 00:30:51,426
I don't think I can drink anymore.

577
00:31:22,185 --> 00:31:23,655
If you can't handle anymore,

578
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,399
want to go rest in a room for a bit?

579
00:31:32,884 --> 00:31:33,969
I...

580
00:31:35,011 --> 00:31:36,468
I'll just go to the bathroom

581
00:31:36,492 --> 00:31:37,612
for a moment.

582
00:31:46,648 --> 00:31:48,208
Where's he going?

583
00:31:48,233 --> 00:31:49,545
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

584
00:31:49,901 --> 00:31:51,147
You're really drunk.

585
00:31:51,361 --> 00:31:52,529
It's good, right?

586
00:31:52,529 --> 00:31:53,708
It's good.

587
00:32:21,766 --> 00:32:22,892
Hyung...

588
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:27,075
I'm really drunk right now.

589
00:32:28,314 --> 00:32:30,255
Can you come pick me up?

590
00:32:41,578 --> 00:32:42,929
(Suhyeon hyung)
Hey, Daon.

591
00:32:43,454 --> 00:32:44,656
Jung Daon!

592
00:32:44,681 --> 00:32:47,211
(Suhyeon hyung)
