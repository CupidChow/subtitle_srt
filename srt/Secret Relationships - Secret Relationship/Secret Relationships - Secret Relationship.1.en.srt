1
00:00:13,573 --> 00:00:14,833
Actually, for me...

2
00:00:15,408 --> 00:00:16,776
Do you want to go eat tteokbokki?

3
00:00:17,619 --> 00:00:18,870
I'm not hungry.

4
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:19,930
Really?

5
00:00:19,955 --> 00:00:22,487
Even sitting and eating with friends...

6
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:24,499
Or having time to joke around

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,800
and hang out...

8
00:00:26,545 --> 00:00:27,701
All of it...

9
00:00:28,213 --> 00:00:29,381
Is a luxury.

10
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,476
In my life, which has been full

11
00:00:37,483 --> 00:00:39,362
of disappointment and misfortune...

12
00:00:42,602 --> 00:00:44,859
The first glimmer of light appeared...

13
00:00:47,349 --> 00:00:49,393
When three men suddenly jumped into...

14
00:00:50,986 --> 00:00:53,113
My mess of a life.

15
00:00:57,742 --> 00:00:59,035
Three people who are not

16
00:01:00,287 --> 00:01:02,173
suitable for someone like me at all.

17
00:01:07,168 --> 00:01:08,527
Can I...

18
00:01:09,254 --> 00:01:11,775
Even have the right to reach to them?

19
00:01:15,919 --> 00:01:20,548
"Secret Relationships"

20
00:01:28,706 --> 00:01:29,814
(Episode 1)
Hello, I'm Assistant Manager Jung Daon,

21
00:01:29,846 --> 00:01:31,266
here to introduce the Albi Construction

22
00:01:31,286 --> 00:01:32,020
job briefing.

23
00:01:32,044 --> 00:01:33,252
Nice to meet you all.

24
00:01:34,946 --> 00:01:36,099
Albi Construction adheres

25
00:01:36,124 --> 00:01:37,416
to the ideology of society...

26
00:01:37,449 --> 00:01:39,075
Human resource management objectives...

27
00:01:39,075 --> 00:01:41,539
Does anyone have any questions?

28
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,205
Experience is...

29
00:01:44,372 --> 00:01:45,575
Thank you.

30
00:01:45,915 --> 00:01:47,805
Shall we take one last question?

31
00:01:56,426 --> 00:01:57,819
If I join Albi Construction,

32
00:01:57,839 --> 00:01:58,932
will there be people like

33
00:01:58,946 --> 00:02:00,159
Song Kang there?

34
00:02:03,933 --> 00:02:05,867
People like Song Kang...

35
00:02:05,914 --> 00:02:06,954
I don't know.

36
00:02:07,012 --> 00:02:08,418
I'm not sure yet.

37
00:02:09,522 --> 00:02:11,048
I, Jong Daon from Albi Construction's

38
00:02:11,073 --> 00:02:12,186
Planning and Strategy Department,

39
00:02:12,211 --> 00:02:13,383
would like to take my leave for now.

40
00:02:22,702 --> 00:02:24,725
We should eat something better outside.

41
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,642
Hyung, you have a lecture soon.

42
00:02:27,874 --> 00:02:29,327
I'm fine with just this drink.

43
00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:32,419
You did well earlier.

44
00:02:33,999 --> 00:02:35,457
Since when were you watching?

45
00:02:36,007 --> 00:02:37,856
I didn't even know you were here.

46
00:02:42,597 --> 00:02:44,057
From the very beginning.

47
00:02:48,436 --> 00:02:49,556
It feels nice to be back

48
00:02:49,563 --> 00:02:50,896
at university after so long.

49
00:02:51,398 --> 00:02:53,149
It brings back memories from that day.

50
00:02:53,608 --> 00:02:54,975
That day?

51
00:02:55,402 --> 00:02:57,195
The day we first talked.

52
00:02:58,728 --> 00:02:59,985
(11 years earlier)
What kind of grades do you

53
00:02:59,992 --> 00:03:01,050
(11 years earlier)
need to get into this school?

54
00:03:01,074 --> 00:03:02,409
Do they care about student records?

55
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:03,547
Are there people like Hyunbin

56
00:03:03,572 --> 00:03:04,505
at Inae University?

57
00:03:08,408 --> 00:03:10,010
Hyunbin...

58
00:03:10,834 --> 00:03:11,849
I'm not sure.

59
00:03:12,203 --> 00:03:13,454
I haven't seen one yet.

60
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:16,381
Shin Jaemin was popular back in school,

61
00:03:16,381 --> 00:03:18,675
- he's still got it here.
- Hey.

62
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,899
He was student president,

63
00:03:19,927 --> 00:03:21,070
top of the class...

64
00:03:21,094 --> 00:03:22,237
And here, what is he?

65
00:03:22,262 --> 00:03:23,321
Top of the department?

66
00:03:23,346 --> 00:03:24,666
He's also that.

67
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:27,735
He's on another level than us.

68
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,561
Right. Compared to people like us,

69
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:31,110
he's just on a different level.

70
00:03:32,731 --> 00:03:33,809
Hey, Jung Daon.

71
00:03:34,232 --> 00:03:35,458
Are you applying to Inae University?

72
00:03:35,483 --> 00:03:37,193
Their architecture program is famous.

73
00:03:38,361 --> 00:03:39,579
I'm not sure.

74
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:41,614
My grades are kind of iffy.

75
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:44,719
(Inae University
architecture department)

76
00:03:46,619 --> 00:03:47,736
I'll go first.

77
00:03:49,602 --> 00:03:50,755
You're not telling me
to treat you, right?

78
00:03:53,243 --> 00:03:54,860
We don't have any money.

79
00:04:00,967 --> 00:04:02,060
Umm...

80
00:04:06,473 --> 00:04:07,932
Do you need tutoring?

81
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:16,488
Ah...

82
00:04:17,442 --> 00:04:18,887
That day...

83
00:04:20,153 --> 00:04:21,481
That day

84
00:04:21,696 --> 00:04:23,239
I was too random, wasn't I?

85
00:04:23,302 --> 00:04:24,457
Right?

86
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:25,753
No.

87
00:04:25,778 --> 00:04:27,173
I was grateful.

88
00:04:27,619 --> 00:04:29,259
I'm still very grateful.

89
00:04:30,205 --> 00:04:31,447
Grateful, huh...

90
00:04:34,454 --> 00:04:35,524
Um...

91
00:04:36,085 --> 00:04:38,563
Did you not like the watch I gave you?

92
00:04:38,588 --> 00:04:39,611
Huh?

93
00:04:40,131 --> 00:04:41,486
Ah...

94
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:43,482
It's not that...

95
00:04:43,507 --> 00:04:44,569
Then why?

96
00:04:44,594 --> 00:04:45,889
Are you afraid of losing it?

97
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,560
Don't think like that.

98
00:04:48,587 --> 00:04:50,618
Make sure to wear it next time we meet.

99
00:04:50,642 --> 00:04:51,688
Okay?

100
00:04:53,353 --> 00:04:54,407
Yes.

101
00:04:54,562 --> 00:04:55,915
I will.

102
00:04:56,481 --> 00:04:57,681
Ah, right.

103
00:04:57,857 --> 00:04:59,334
Where are we meeting tomorrow?

104
00:04:59,359 --> 00:05:00,877
Ah, the time and place...

105
00:05:00,902 --> 00:05:02,284
I'll tell you tomorrow.

106
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,302
That just makes me more curious.

107
00:05:05,824 --> 00:05:07,238
What did you prepare?

108
00:05:07,617 --> 00:05:09,406
What are you hiding so much?

109
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:12,192
It was your birthday recently,

110
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:14,374
there's something I really want to say.

111
00:05:15,174 --> 00:05:16,548
I want to use this chance.

112
00:05:22,966 --> 00:05:24,478
I should get to teach.

113
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:26,806
See you tomorrow, Daon.

114
00:05:27,887 --> 00:05:28,972
See you tomorrow.

115
00:05:28,997 --> 00:05:30,111
I'll call you.

116
00:05:59,294 --> 00:06:00,753
Happy birthday, hyung.

117
00:06:02,105 --> 00:06:04,524
I bought this thinking of you,

118
00:06:04,549 --> 00:06:06,759
but I don't know if you'll like it.

119
00:06:07,176 --> 00:06:08,287
Actually...

120
00:06:08,312 --> 00:06:09,612
There's something I haven't

121
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,781
been able to say.

122
00:06:10,805 --> 00:06:12,265
The truth is, I like...

123
00:06:17,103 --> 00:06:19,188
He's on another level than us.

124
00:06:19,188 --> 00:06:20,481
Compared to people like us,

125
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:21,931
he's just on a different level.

126
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,026
Things are different now

127
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:31,192
than they were back then.

128
00:06:52,931 --> 00:06:54,050
I'm really curious about

129
00:06:54,077 --> 00:06:55,492
what you want to say.

130
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:57,143
Can't you give me a hint?

131
00:07:07,111 --> 00:07:08,546
I'll tell you when we meet.

132
00:07:08,571 --> 00:07:09,881
Don't be late!

133
00:07:09,906 --> 00:07:11,390
Be careful!

134
00:07:30,877 --> 00:07:32,553
Are you okay?

135
00:07:41,437 --> 00:07:43,022
Ah, you don't need to thank me.

136
00:07:43,022 --> 00:07:44,164
What did you do?

137
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:46,250
Huh? Ah...

138
00:07:46,275 --> 00:07:47,488
You almost got hit by a scooter,

139
00:07:47,522 --> 00:07:48,420
so I was just trying to help...

140
00:07:48,445 --> 00:07:49,530
Did I ask you to help?

141
00:07:50,446 --> 00:07:52,633
It broke because of you.

142
00:07:53,825 --> 00:07:55,176
Wait.

143
00:07:55,201 --> 00:07:57,184
- Why did it break?
- What are you going to do about it?

144
00:07:57,662 --> 00:07:59,372
I said, what are you going to do?

145
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,783
I'm sorry.

146
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,413
But you're being a bit harsh to someone

147
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,719
who was just trying to help.

148
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,004
You said I'm a bit harsh?

149
00:08:06,004 --> 00:08:07,247
I'll pay for the repair.

150
00:08:07,272 --> 00:08:08,265
How much is it?

151
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,275
Should I buy a new one?

152
00:08:09,299 --> 00:08:10,318
Do you think this is

153
00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:11,572
about the repair cost?

154
00:08:12,385 --> 00:08:13,695
Do you know what that watch means to me?

155
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,150
You're really shameless.

156
00:08:15,794 --> 00:08:17,317
I tried to help you.

157
00:08:18,024 --> 00:08:19,888
You're the weird one here.

158
00:08:20,143 --> 00:08:21,577
Are you making a fuss just because

159
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:23,089
you wanted a thank you?

160
00:08:23,114 --> 00:08:24,123
If it weren't for you,

161
00:08:24,143 --> 00:08:25,623
my watch wouldn't have broken.

162
00:08:33,114 --> 00:08:35,434
Unnecessary meddling is a disease.

163
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,184
Got it?

164
00:08:41,956 --> 00:08:43,356
Hey you.

165
00:08:44,456 --> 00:08:45,727
Hey you!

166
00:08:45,752 --> 00:08:46,825
Hey!

167
00:08:51,771 --> 00:08:52,625
Wait, what?

168
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,543
Unnecessary meddling is a disease?

169
00:08:54,642 --> 00:08:56,067
Just wait until I see him again.

170
00:08:56,088 --> 00:08:57,406
Next time, I'll really…

171
00:08:57,431 --> 00:08:58,573
You're dead meat.

172
00:08:58,931 --> 00:09:00,118
Umm...

173
00:09:01,297 --> 00:09:02,305
Mr. Ju Seonghyeon.

174
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,709
Yes.

175
00:09:03,936 --> 00:09:05,115
That's me.

176
00:09:09,275 --> 00:09:10,696
Alright, alright, listen up!

177
00:09:11,778 --> 00:09:12,920
Everyone, this is

178
00:09:12,945 --> 00:09:14,078
Assistant Ju Seonghyeon

179
00:09:14,091 --> 00:09:15,751
who's joining our team as of today.

180
00:09:16,409 --> 00:09:18,009
Hello. I'm Ju Seonghyeon.

181
00:09:18,034 --> 00:09:19,604
Nice to meet you all.

182
00:09:20,578 --> 00:09:22,472
You can all introduce yourselves later.

183
00:09:22,497 --> 00:09:23,715
This is your desk, Seong Hyeon.

184
00:09:24,034 --> 00:09:25,020
If you need anything,

185
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,254
ask Deputy Manager Jung.

186
00:09:27,126 --> 00:09:28,305
Deputy Manager Jung?

187
00:09:31,714 --> 00:09:33,001
- Deputy Manager.
- Yes?

188
00:09:33,026 --> 00:09:34,667
Hello. Nice to meet you.

189
00:09:36,837 --> 00:09:38,529
Unnecessary meddling is a disease.

190
00:09:38,554 --> 00:09:39,737
Got it?

191
00:09:39,842 --> 00:09:40,903
Rude?

192
00:09:40,928 --> 00:09:42,072
Meddling?

193
00:09:42,847 --> 00:09:44,424
Rude? Meddling?

194
00:09:44,449 --> 00:09:45,496
Do you two know each other?

195
00:09:45,521 --> 00:09:46,676
- No.
- No.

196
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,141
That's the number one from Jinyeol

197
00:09:49,148 --> 00:09:50,463
Construction that took
a long time to recruit.

198
00:09:50,487 --> 00:09:52,033
Take care of him and

199
00:09:52,054 --> 00:09:53,580
make sure he adjusts well.

200
00:09:54,946 --> 00:09:56,130
Me?

201
00:09:56,155 --> 00:09:57,641
Well, you're both Assistant Managers

202
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:58,899
and sit next to each other.

203
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:14,563
What a coincidence.

204
00:10:14,588 --> 00:10:16,009
We meet again here like this.

205
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,220
A coincidence?

206
00:10:18,164 --> 00:10:19,345
More like bad luck.

207
00:10:19,345 --> 00:10:20,691
It could've been a coincidence,

208
00:10:20,712 --> 00:10:21,824
but you turned it bad.

209
00:10:21,848 --> 00:10:22,974
Just so we're clear,

210
00:10:22,974 --> 00:10:24,254
I'd appreciate it if you didn't

211
00:10:24,281 --> 00:10:25,911
meddle unnecessarily at work.

212
00:10:25,935 --> 00:10:27,770
Just so we're clear, too,

213
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:29,241
I'd appreciate it if you didn't walk

214
00:10:29,248 --> 00:10:30,561
around staring at your phone.

215
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:45,878
The documents you need to review

216
00:10:45,885 --> 00:10:47,099
before tomorrow's meeting.

217
00:10:47,123 --> 00:10:48,910
You don't need any explanations, right?

218
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,984
Since you're supposedly an ace.

219
00:10:51,728 --> 00:10:52,734
Of course.

220
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:53,969
No need at all.

221
00:11:09,478 --> 00:11:10,790
What did he mean by that?

222
00:11:16,611 --> 00:11:18,051
Alright, Strategy Planning Team,

223
00:11:18,058 --> 00:11:19,298
quick announcement.

224
00:11:19,322 --> 00:11:20,323
Since Assistant Manager Ju Seonghyeon

225
00:11:20,323 --> 00:11:21,741
has officially joined us today,

226
00:11:21,741 --> 00:11:24,135
We can't just let it pass.

227
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,078
So, in honor of his arrival,

228
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:27,371
we're having a team dinner tonight!

229
00:11:27,404 --> 00:11:28,677
Wow!

230
00:11:29,874 --> 00:11:31,626
Woo! Sounds great.

231
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,311
Let's clock out!

232
00:11:33,336 --> 00:11:34,570
Manager.

233
00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:45,984
(Dolwangjumokgogi)

234
00:11:47,818 --> 00:11:50,820
Wow. So thoughtful.

235
00:11:51,771 --> 00:11:53,789
But is Assistant Manager Jung Daon

236
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:55,747
usually the type to be late?

237
00:11:55,772 --> 00:11:57,185
He has a prior engagement

238
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,890
and can't come today.

239
00:11:59,353 --> 00:12:00,602
But isn't this the first time

240
00:12:00,609 --> 00:12:02,609
he's skipped a company dinner?

241
00:12:02,782 --> 00:12:04,198
Is it an important engagement?

242
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,325
That time with Joohee

243
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,801
for the welcome party

244
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:08,410
he postponed his plans to come.

245
00:12:09,538 --> 00:12:10,775
Maybe there's someone here

246
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,921
he doesn't want to meet?

247
00:12:15,378 --> 00:12:16,838
Could it be because of me?

248
00:12:32,645 --> 00:12:33,801
Hyung!

249
00:12:34,981 --> 00:12:36,207
Sorry.

250
00:12:36,232 --> 00:12:37,746
Did you wait long?

251
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:39,097
No.

252
00:12:39,122 --> 00:12:40,497
I just got here too.

253
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:43,461
Wait a sec.

254
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,207
There.

255
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:56,198
So?

256
00:12:57,211 --> 00:12:59,070
Where should we go?

257
00:12:59,463 --> 00:13:00,992
I made a reservation.

258
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:03,259
This way.

259
00:13:21,277 --> 00:13:23,027
You reserved this place?

260
00:13:23,738 --> 00:13:24,998
This is where we came when

261
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,174
you got into college.

262
00:13:26,198 --> 00:13:27,429
Back then, you treated me

263
00:13:27,456 --> 00:13:28,656
to a nice meal.

264
00:13:28,951 --> 00:13:30,611
So today, I wanted to treat you.

265
00:13:31,454 --> 00:13:33,086
Order anything you want.

266
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:35,412
It's fine.

267
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:36,844
Do it later,

268
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:38,291
when you're more successful.

269
00:13:38,878 --> 00:13:39,978
You've been saying that

270
00:13:39,998 --> 00:13:41,064
for 11 years now.

271
00:13:41,297 --> 00:13:42,617
Sometimes I think...

272
00:13:43,087 --> 00:13:44,193
You still see me as

273
00:13:44,207 --> 00:13:45,694
a high school student.

274
00:13:45,718 --> 00:13:46,832
Of course.

275
00:13:46,857 --> 00:13:48,278
In my eyes, you're still that kid who

276
00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:49,544
cried about not being able

277
00:13:49,551 --> 00:13:50,551
to get tutoring.

278
00:13:52,735 --> 00:13:55,828
(10 years ago)

279
00:13:55,853 --> 00:13:57,161
I'm sorry.

280
00:13:58,706 --> 00:14:00,474
I don't have enough money,

281
00:14:00,566 --> 00:14:02,761
So I have to stop the tutoring.

282
00:14:03,611 --> 00:14:04,612
Thank you.

283
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,126
Forget the tutoring fee.

284
00:14:18,501 --> 00:14:19,877
Just do your best.

285
00:14:21,712 --> 00:14:22,737
I want to go to the

286
00:14:22,751 --> 00:14:23,851
same university as you.

287
00:14:45,277 --> 00:14:48,322
I've changed a lot since then.

288
00:14:48,923 --> 00:14:50,908
I'm not a student or a kid anymore.

289
00:14:51,784 --> 00:14:53,346
I know. I was just joking.

290
00:14:54,703 --> 00:14:55,921
But...

291
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,845
You look really tired these days.

292
00:14:58,165 --> 00:14:59,352
Oh...

293
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:01,299
There's a project at work

294
00:15:01,319 --> 00:15:02,938
that I really want to be part of.

295
00:15:02,962 --> 00:15:04,516
I think I overworked myself a bit.

296
00:15:05,423 --> 00:15:06,703
If we win the bid,

297
00:15:06,728 --> 00:15:08,313
I can be sent to an overseas branch.

298
00:15:09,969 --> 00:15:11,055
Why go to overseas branch

299
00:15:11,062 --> 00:15:12,095
all of a sudden?

300
00:15:12,888 --> 00:15:15,395
I heard you might go abroad,

301
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,693
so I thought it'd be nice

302
00:15:18,713 --> 00:15:19,813
if I could follow you too.

303
00:15:22,648 --> 00:15:23,843
Really?

304
00:15:24,817 --> 00:15:26,062
Hope it works out.

305
00:15:29,558 --> 00:15:30,611
Youth!

306
00:15:30,636 --> 00:15:34,723
Youth is right now!

307
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,585
By the way,

308
00:15:42,585 --> 00:15:43,605
what kind of person is

309
00:15:43,619 --> 00:15:44,771
Assistant Manager Jung Daon?

310
00:15:44,805 --> 00:15:46,888
I saw him earlier, he didn't talk much.

311
00:15:47,508 --> 00:15:50,050
- He seems kinda ru...
- He's an amazing person!

312
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,343
Great at his job,

313
00:15:51,343 --> 00:15:53,345
takes care of his teammates,

314
00:15:53,345 --> 00:15:55,890
and super good-looking.

315
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,475
Graduated top of his class at Inae,

316
00:15:57,475 --> 00:15:58,501
there are even rumors

317
00:15:58,526 --> 00:15:59,453
he's from a rich family.

318
00:15:59,477 --> 00:16:01,187
On top of that, he has a great personality.

319
00:16:01,187 --> 00:16:02,772
He has a great personality?

320
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:08,944
Oh… I see.

321
00:16:08,944 --> 00:16:11,464
Everyone's practically fighting

322
00:16:11,477 --> 00:16:13,270
to be on his team.

323
00:16:21,874 --> 00:16:22,917
Oh, right.

324
00:16:23,501 --> 00:16:24,551
What was it you wanted

325
00:16:24,578 --> 00:16:25,604
to talk about today?

326
00:16:26,261 --> 00:16:27,938
Ah… well…

327
00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:46,630
I…

328
00:16:47,608 --> 00:16:48,924
There's something I've wanted

329
00:16:48,938 --> 00:16:50,124
to tell you for a long time.

330
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,951
Actually…

331
00:16:57,019 --> 00:16:59,326
(Dad)

332
00:17:01,664 --> 00:17:02,748
Oppa.

333
00:17:02,748 --> 00:17:05,287
Dad keeps asking me where you live.

334
00:17:05,623 --> 00:17:07,323
I think he wants to borrow money.

335
00:17:07,348 --> 00:17:08,708
What should I do?

336
00:17:11,917 --> 00:17:13,444
Are Mom and Dad still like that?

337
00:17:13,884 --> 00:17:15,511
Still asking for money?

338
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,773
Yeah.

339
00:17:20,367 --> 00:17:21,830
But moving out and living on your own

340
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,152
like you said is the right thing to do.

341
00:17:23,177 --> 00:17:24,669
I'm not lending them money anymore.

342
00:17:25,187 --> 00:17:27,671
I can handle these things myself now,

343
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:29,955
so you don't have to worry.

344
00:17:31,026 --> 00:17:32,041
Really?

345
00:17:32,987 --> 00:17:34,446
You've really grown up, Daon.

346
00:17:37,366 --> 00:17:38,537
Hyung…

347
00:17:38,993 --> 00:17:40,571
- Actually…
- Daon.

348
00:17:42,746 --> 00:17:44,321
Listen carefully and don't be shocked.

349
00:17:47,209 --> 00:17:49,201
Suhyeon is coming back to Korea soon.

350
00:17:54,383 --> 00:17:55,726
We decided to date.

351
00:17:56,844 --> 00:17:58,211
He and me.

352
00:18:07,934 --> 00:18:11,512
Come on, eat some snacks.

353
00:18:14,447 --> 00:18:16,184
(Half of me)

354
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,699
Anyone likes chocolate milk?

355
00:18:18,699 --> 00:18:19,769
I'll go buy some.

356
00:18:23,621 --> 00:18:24,722
Grandma.

357
00:18:24,747 --> 00:18:26,015
Are things selling well?

358
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,093
How's your health?

359
00:18:27,118 --> 00:18:28,703
I'm okay.

360
00:18:29,126 --> 00:18:30,699
But you're starting

361
00:18:30,713 --> 00:18:32,579
your first day at a new job,

362
00:18:32,588 --> 00:18:33,922
how are the people there?

363
00:18:33,922 --> 00:18:35,343
Everyone is nice to me.

364
00:18:35,876 --> 00:18:36,916
Ah…

365
00:18:37,635 --> 00:18:38,776
There's this one rude guy

366
00:18:38,796 --> 00:18:40,196
who's a bit annoying, though.

367
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,806
Rude?

368
00:18:42,306 --> 00:18:43,907
Is someone bothering you?

369
00:18:43,932 --> 00:18:45,292
If there's anyone bothering you,

370
00:18:45,306 --> 00:18:46,494
just tell me right away.

371
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:47,854
I'll close the store,

372
00:18:47,881 --> 00:18:49,341
and I'll go right away.

373
00:18:49,563 --> 00:18:51,275
I got it. Don't worry.

374
00:18:51,357 --> 00:18:52,991
I'll come to the store this week.

375
00:18:53,016 --> 00:18:54,306
- Okay.
- I'll hang up.

376
00:18:55,497 --> 00:18:57,359
(Points giveaway promotion)

377
00:18:57,821 --> 00:18:58,922
Are you out?

378
00:18:58,947 --> 00:19:00,805
I just stopped by the convenience store.

379
00:19:01,116 --> 00:19:02,826
Stay there for a moment, Daon.

380
00:19:13,045 --> 00:19:14,123
Daon.

381
00:19:32,815 --> 00:19:34,580
Are you going to date that person?

382
00:19:35,402 --> 00:19:36,479
Huh?

383
00:19:38,862 --> 00:19:39,848
I said are you going to

384
00:19:39,873 --> 00:19:40,908
date that person?

385
00:19:44,243 --> 00:19:45,577
What do you mean?

386
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:49,989
Please don't date him.

387
00:19:53,502 --> 00:19:55,629
Don't date him.

388
00:19:57,506 --> 00:19:59,091
Please don't date him.

389
00:20:00,134 --> 00:20:01,218
Please.

390
00:20:10,436 --> 00:20:12,229
I won't date him.

391
00:20:12,807 --> 00:20:14,058
Don't worry.

392
00:21:22,341 --> 00:21:24,134
He's an amazing person!

393
00:21:24,134 --> 00:21:25,677
Great at his job,

394
00:21:25,677 --> 00:21:27,554
takes care of his teammates,

395
00:21:27,554 --> 00:21:30,015
and super good-looking.

396
00:21:30,015 --> 00:21:31,391
Graduated top of his class at Inae,

397
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,401
there are even rumors

398
00:21:32,422 --> 00:21:33,568
he's from a rich family.

399
00:21:34,853 --> 00:21:36,582
Is someone so perfect really acting

400
00:21:36,607 --> 00:21:38,703
that way just because of a watch?

401
00:21:38,743 --> 00:21:39,838
Yeah!

402
00:21:39,863 --> 00:21:41,909
I can just buy him one!

403
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,855
(Watch)

404
00:21:48,331 --> 00:21:49,464
This one.

405
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,137
(8,500,000 won)

406
00:21:52,162 --> 00:21:53,497
One, ten, hundred...

407
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:55,122
Thousand, ten thousand,

408
00:21:55,142 --> 00:21:56,155
hundred thousand,

409
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,472
A million?

410
00:21:58,497 --> 00:21:59,988
Eight million five hundred thousand.

411
00:22:14,158 --> 00:22:15,353
Ah!

412
00:22:22,317 --> 00:22:23,650
Good morning!

413
00:22:27,155 --> 00:22:28,574
Do you feel better now?

414
00:22:29,032 --> 00:22:30,325
I'm fine.

415
00:22:30,951 --> 00:22:33,864
Hyung, was I disrespectful yesterday?

416
00:22:36,123 --> 00:22:38,326
You seemed to have plans yesterday.

417
00:22:39,001 --> 00:22:40,474
If you had come to the company dinner,

418
00:22:40,499 --> 00:22:41,772
it would've been a good chance

419
00:22:41,781 --> 00:22:42,805
to get closer.

420
00:22:43,881 --> 00:22:45,263
Assistant Manager Jung.

421
00:22:45,716 --> 00:22:47,442
- That watch...
- Two million.

422
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:49,841
Repair cost.

423
00:22:49,887 --> 00:22:51,036
Two million.

424
00:22:53,724 --> 00:22:55,142
Oh. Two million.

425
00:22:56,435 --> 00:22:57,700
Oh. Two million.

426
00:23:00,022 --> 00:23:01,857
Jung Daon, I'm back in Korea.

427
00:23:07,529 --> 00:23:08,655
Answer the phone while

428
00:23:08,669 --> 00:23:09,769
I'm still being nice.

429
00:23:10,115 --> 00:23:11,146
Don't tell me you still

430
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,186
like Shin Jaemin?

431
00:23:18,665 --> 00:23:20,751
Well, right now I have some reasons...

432
00:23:20,751 --> 00:23:22,169
A situation, so what?

433
00:23:22,674 --> 00:23:23,921
What I'm saying is...

434
00:23:23,921 --> 00:23:25,447
I don't think I need to be considerate

435
00:23:25,461 --> 00:23:26,524
of Assistant Manager Joo's situation.

436
00:23:26,548 --> 00:23:27,966
The door is opening.

437
00:23:34,473 --> 00:23:35,574
What?

438
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:36,919
Isn't it basic manners to listen

439
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,406
until someone finishes speaking?

440
00:23:38,769 --> 00:23:39,943
So, you're saying you

441
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,336
won't be considerate, right?

442
00:23:41,855 --> 00:23:43,424
Then I won't be considerate

443
00:23:43,449 --> 00:23:44,744
of you either!

444
00:24:00,206 --> 00:24:01,206
(Conference room)

445
00:24:02,948 --> 00:24:03,948
(In a meeting)

446
00:24:04,826 --> 00:24:05,826
(Conference room)

447
00:24:09,067 --> 00:24:12,177
(Albi Construction)

448
00:24:12,661 --> 00:24:13,661
Oh.

449
00:24:16,048 --> 00:24:17,048
(Ju Seonghyeon)

450
00:24:29,403 --> 00:24:30,862
Why are you acting so childish?

451
00:24:31,446 --> 00:24:32,469
Huh?

452
00:24:33,323 --> 00:24:35,288
Me? What did I do?

453
00:24:35,313 --> 00:24:36,576
The heater,

454
00:24:36,576 --> 00:24:37,577
the door...

455
00:24:37,577 --> 00:24:39,096
You did it all on purpose, right?

456
00:24:39,121 --> 00:24:40,683
Ah...

457
00:24:41,081 --> 00:24:43,542
Yes, I did it on purpose.

458
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:44,728
Assistant Manager Jung said she

459
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:45,895
wouldn't be considerate of my situation,

460
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,963
I'm not going to be considerate
of yours either.

461
00:24:47,963 --> 00:24:49,314
How is that the same thing?

462
00:24:49,339 --> 00:24:50,340
What's different about it?

463
00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:53,088
Everyone has their own reasons.

464
00:24:56,388 --> 00:24:57,401
The Dubai resort

465
00:24:57,421 --> 00:24:58,449
construction project bid,

466
00:24:58,473 --> 00:25:00,283
the team announcement is out.

467
00:25:00,308 --> 00:25:02,227
Oh, Assistant Manager Jung, look.

468
00:25:08,243 --> 00:25:10,197
(Announcement of the names of those responsible
for the Dubai resort construction project)

469
00:25:10,222 --> 00:25:12,970
(Members: Assistant Jung
Daon Assistant Ju Seonghyeon)

470
00:25:18,952 --> 00:25:21,190
Oh wow, Assistant Manager Jung,

471
00:25:21,197 --> 00:25:22,477
congratulations!

472
00:25:22,539 --> 00:25:24,725
Oh my, what are we going to do?

473
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,835
You worked so hard for this, and finally

474
00:25:26,835 --> 00:25:28,070
Assistant Manager Jung is

475
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:29,522
in charge of the resort bid!

476
00:25:29,546 --> 00:25:30,809
You know I tried really hard

477
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,175
to push for you, right?

478
00:25:32,841 --> 00:25:34,259
Yes, thank you.

479
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,054
And we even have our ace,

480
00:25:37,054 --> 00:25:38,376
Assistant Manager Ju, joining the team.

481
00:25:38,397 --> 00:25:39,490
Work well together.

482
00:25:39,514 --> 00:25:41,229
Also, the chairman is putting

483
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,910
a lot of effort into this bid.

484
00:25:42,934 --> 00:25:44,260
What's the most important thing

485
00:25:44,281 --> 00:25:45,373
to the chairman?

486
00:25:45,397 --> 00:25:46,430
Teamwork.

487
00:25:46,455 --> 00:25:47,534
So the two of you really

488
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:48,635
need to work together.

489
00:25:49,691 --> 00:25:51,234
What's with your face,
Assistant Manager Ju?

490
00:25:51,234 --> 00:25:52,319
Are you not happy about this?

491
00:25:54,117 --> 00:25:55,449
Manager,

492
00:25:55,824 --> 00:25:57,168
- I... um...
- Assistant Manager Ju...

493
00:25:59,618 --> 00:26:01,149
Let's talk for a moment.

494
00:26:05,624 --> 00:26:07,295
What do you want to say?

495
00:26:07,584 --> 00:26:08,944
As you heard earlier,

496
00:26:08,969 --> 00:26:10,603
this TF (Task Force) is a big deal.

497
00:26:10,629 --> 00:26:13,090
It's extremely important to me.

498
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:14,583
And I'm sure it's a great opportunity

499
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:15,735
for you as well.

500
00:26:15,772 --> 00:26:17,147
That's true.

501
00:26:18,345 --> 00:26:20,384
But you and I have a bad history.

502
00:26:20,597 --> 00:26:22,766
Then how can we work together?

503
00:26:22,766 --> 00:26:24,159
Instead, I'll go to the manager

504
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:25,219
and tell him

505
00:26:25,227 --> 00:26:26,895
that our relationship is terrible.

506
00:26:26,895 --> 00:26:27,938
Didn't you hear what

507
00:26:27,952 --> 00:26:29,278
the manager just said?

508
00:26:29,302 --> 00:26:30,393
The chairman values

509
00:26:30,407 --> 00:26:31,867
teamwork above all else.

510
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:34,945
Complaining about it will only hurt us.

511
00:26:35,403 --> 00:26:36,480
Let's just bite the bullet

512
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:37,533
and work together.

513
00:26:43,495 --> 00:26:46,229
Then I think we need some ground rules.

514
00:26:46,331 --> 00:26:47,632
Rules?

515
00:26:47,657 --> 00:26:49,510
As you know,

516
00:26:49,535 --> 00:26:51,102
we don't get along very well.

517
00:26:51,128 --> 00:26:53,230
Well, that's true, but...

518
00:26:53,255 --> 00:26:54,887
First, for teamwork, we should have

519
00:26:54,901 --> 00:26:57,151
at least one meal together each day.

520
00:26:57,175 --> 00:26:58,832
Also, to build camaraderie, we should

521
00:26:58,853 --> 00:27:00,738
share a bit about our personal lives.

522
00:27:00,762 --> 00:27:02,264
Sometimes it's good to talk about work

523
00:27:02,264 --> 00:27:03,807
outside of the office to relieve stress.

524
00:27:03,807 --> 00:27:05,350
Plus, to keep each other motivated,

525
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,293
we should compliment

526
00:27:06,314 --> 00:27:07,245
each other once an hour.

527
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:08,846
Then, under no circumstances,

528
00:27:08,871 --> 00:27:10,446
should we eat together.

529
00:27:10,479 --> 00:27:11,834
No prying into personal matters,

530
00:27:11,841 --> 00:27:12,875
no matter how curious.

531
00:27:12,899 --> 00:27:14,234
We each take our own breaks.

532
00:27:14,234 --> 00:27:15,652
Never be late.

533
00:27:15,652 --> 00:27:16,547
No crossing the line,

534
00:27:16,572 --> 00:27:17,412
no excessive flattery.

535
00:27:17,445 --> 00:27:18,982
Aren't you being a bit too much?

536
00:27:20,198 --> 00:27:21,700
I just suggested things we can follow...

537
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,024
There's not a single thing from

538
00:27:23,031 --> 00:27:24,458
your list that I can agree to.

539
00:27:26,788 --> 00:27:28,140
Then that's settled, right?

540
00:27:28,165 --> 00:27:29,554
Alright, I'll go tell the manager

541
00:27:29,579 --> 00:27:30,894
that I can't do this.

542
00:27:34,546 --> 00:27:35,811
Fine.

543
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,341
We'll do it your way,
Assistant Manager Ju.

544
00:27:38,341 --> 00:27:39,568
Really?

545
00:27:39,593 --> 00:27:40,981
No take-backs.

546
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,352
Oh.

547
00:27:43,513 --> 00:27:44,747
And...

548
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:46,468
Can I pay for the repair

549
00:27:46,475 --> 00:27:47,755
in installments?

550
00:27:48,268 --> 00:27:49,785
It turned out to be more expensive

551
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:50,787
than I expected.

552
00:27:50,812 --> 00:27:52,030
Ah...

553
00:27:52,522 --> 00:27:53,724
You don't have to pay me.

554
00:27:53,749 --> 00:27:55,000
No, I'll pay you.

555
00:27:55,025 --> 00:27:56,818
I'm not saying I won't, I just mean...

556
00:27:56,818 --> 00:27:58,138
It's really okay.

557
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,624
I already sent it in for repairs.

558
00:28:02,782 --> 00:28:03,977
I'm sorry.

559
00:28:05,285 --> 00:28:07,574
I really didn't do it on purpose.

560
00:28:09,873 --> 00:28:11,248
It's okay.

561
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:13,585
That watch was really important to me,

562
00:28:13,585 --> 00:28:14,836
so I think I overreacted.

563
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,439
Anyway...

564
00:28:17,464 --> 00:28:18,725
Let's do our best.

565
00:28:31,102 --> 00:28:32,687
It's a bit crooked.

566
00:28:38,026 --> 00:28:39,336
Is that better?

567
00:28:39,361 --> 00:28:40,549
No...

568
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:53,333
Not like that.

569
00:28:56,628 --> 00:28:58,421
Leave it longer like this.

570
00:29:09,766 --> 00:29:10,766
Ah!

571
00:29:11,975 --> 00:29:13,442
It's kind of warm in here.

572
00:29:14,145 --> 00:29:16,189
Is the heater too strong?

573
00:29:28,702 --> 00:29:29,768
I just finished my class

574
00:29:29,789 --> 00:29:30,805
and checked my phone.

575
00:29:30,829 --> 00:29:32,125
Did you leave work?

576
00:29:33,707 --> 00:29:35,250
I stopped by a café near the office.

577
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,746
I think I'll be here late.

578
00:29:37,002 --> 00:29:38,189
What about you?

579
00:29:39,879 --> 00:29:41,178
I'll probably be at university

580
00:29:41,203 --> 00:29:42,483
until late, too.

581
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:45,235
Then...

582
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,332
Do you want to grab

583
00:29:46,357 --> 00:29:47,389
a late dinner together?

584
00:30:16,374 --> 00:30:17,534
Kim Suhyeon?

585
00:30:27,177 --> 00:30:28,595
It was all a misunderstanding.

586
00:30:30,305 --> 00:30:32,101
Thinking I could reach for him.

587
00:30:32,689 --> 00:30:34,149
A foolish delusion.

588
00:30:38,772 --> 00:30:39,920
Yeah.

589
00:30:40,315 --> 00:30:41,518
This is how it should be.

590
00:30:42,317 --> 00:30:43,337
Love is for people

591
00:30:43,357 --> 00:30:44,637
who are on the same level.

592
00:30:55,105 --> 00:30:57,520
(7 years ago)

593
00:31:24,968 --> 00:31:29,426
(When I smelled this perfume,
I thought of you, so I bought it)

594
00:31:51,886 --> 00:31:53,050
Hyung.

595
00:32:01,604 --> 00:32:03,106
Why are you two together?

596
00:32:05,292 --> 00:32:07,135
- You two just met outside and...
- We decided to date.

597
00:32:08,567 --> 00:32:09,621
He and me.

598
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:41,393
Congratulations.
