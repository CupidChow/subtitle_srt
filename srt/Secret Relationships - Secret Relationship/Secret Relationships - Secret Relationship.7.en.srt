00:00:02,587 --> 00:00:03,774
Hyung!

2
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:24,351
This is all your fault.

3
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:26,883
Because you like to open

4
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,089
your heart to people easily.

5
00:00:28,113 --> 00:00:29,265
You give your heart away

6
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:30,545
to anyone who's kind to you.

7
00:00:32,242 --> 00:00:33,906
So I had to resort to this.

8
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:36,040
Hyung.

9
00:00:36,913 --> 00:00:37,956
First, put the knife down…

10
00:00:37,987 --> 00:00:39,262
I don't have to worry about it?

11
00:00:41,376 --> 00:00:42,502
You'll handle it yourself?

12
00:00:44,776 --> 00:00:47,236
Do you know how much I worry about you?

13
00:00:48,341 --> 00:00:51,020
How much I've sacrificed for you?

14
00:00:52,137 --> 00:00:54,230
Now you don't need me anymore?

15
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,600
How can you throw me away like this?!

16
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:06,109
If you make me miserable again...

17
00:01:07,986 --> 00:01:09,368
Daon…

18
00:01:21,249 --> 00:01:22,678
Where are you?

19
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:25,063
Did something happen?

20
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:28,992
I'm worried. Let me know

21
00:01:29,017 --> 00:01:30,052
when you see my text.

22
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:35,263
I'll be waiting.

23
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:51,493
"Secret Relationships"

24
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:58,141
(Episode 7)

25
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,720
Are you feeling a bit better?

26
00:02:22,313 --> 00:02:23,739
We've only given you first aid,

27
00:02:23,753 --> 00:02:25,119
so you need a full check-up.

28
00:02:25,355 --> 00:02:26,481
Once you finish the IV,

29
00:02:26,506 --> 00:02:27,854
we'll take you for a CT scan.

30
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:29,553
Excuse me.

31
00:02:31,236 --> 00:02:34,155
The person who came with me…

32
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:36,004
Oh, he had something to do,

33
00:02:36,029 --> 00:02:37,071
so he left first.

34
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:39,573
He left?

35
00:02:39,698 --> 00:02:42,038
Oh, and he asked me to give you this.

36
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:02,058
All this time, you've sacrificed for me.

37
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,926
You've looked out for me…

38
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,979
And I'm grateful for that.

39
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,748
But

40
00:03:08,773 --> 00:03:10,433
the thing with Park Junghoon,

41
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:12,068
and sending Suhyeon hyung abroad…

42
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,985
made me confused.

43
00:03:17,365 --> 00:03:19,380
If you really did all that for me,

44
00:03:20,243 --> 00:03:22,328
then please, don't do it anymore.

45
00:03:23,538 --> 00:03:24,931
I have something urgent today,

46
00:03:24,956 --> 00:03:26,044
so I'll be going now.

47
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:30,503
I've never followed my heart before,

48
00:03:31,963 --> 00:03:33,756
but losing something and regretting it…

49
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:35,967
I don't want to do that anymore.

50
00:03:51,524 --> 00:03:52,901
Assistant Manager Jung.

51
00:03:57,058 --> 00:03:58,428
Why haven't you been answering?

52
00:03:59,046 --> 00:04:00,633
Do you know how worried I was?

53
00:04:00,664 --> 00:04:01,851
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:03,745 --> 00:04:05,118
I was a bit busy.

55
00:04:14,297 --> 00:04:15,381
What happened here?

56
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:18,718
Ah… That…

57
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:31,302
So the thing you wanted to tell me…

58
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,760
Was this?

59
00:04:34,369 --> 00:04:35,749
- No, it's not that...
- I was the only one hoping

60
00:04:35,774 --> 00:04:36,809
like a fool again.

61
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:33,681
So it was real?

62
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:37,446
I called you, and they said

63
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:38,800
you were at the hospital.

64
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,883
That you were alone without a guardian.

65
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,830
Weren't you supposed to meet Jung Daon?

66
00:05:48,975 --> 00:05:50,018
At first, I wasn't sure,

67
00:05:51,436 --> 00:05:52,770
but now that I'm here, I get it.

68
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:56,662
To him, we're nothing now.

69
00:05:56,962 --> 00:05:58,115
You can't make him waver

70
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,334
as easily as before.

71
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,410
If you came all the way here

72
00:06:00,451 --> 00:06:01,130
just to say that, then get lost.

73
00:06:01,154 --> 00:06:02,530
That's why we should team up.

74
00:06:04,032 --> 00:06:05,045
Look, you and I,

75
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,558
we can't do anything alone.

76
00:06:07,285 --> 00:06:08,302
Wouldn't it be better

77
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:09,455
if we worked together?

78
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:11,702
Think about it carefully.

79
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:13,774
Right now, it's not about

80
00:06:13,788 --> 00:06:15,468
whether you or I have it.

81
00:06:16,252 --> 00:06:17,656
It's about making sure that bastard

82
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,016
Ju Seonghyeon doesn't get it.

83
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:23,265
So, we each find our own way

84
00:06:23,285 --> 00:06:24,478
and keep in touch?

85
00:06:25,678 --> 00:06:26,888
I don't care.

86
00:06:30,475 --> 00:06:31,540
I have no intention of

87
00:06:31,554 --> 00:06:32,619
teaming up with you.

88
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:33,967
Even after going through all that?

89
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:36,709
I've done enough.

90
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:38,598
So, what? You're giving up

91
00:06:38,611 --> 00:06:39,731
on Jung Daon?

92
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:41,666
You?

93
00:06:41,736 --> 00:06:42,769
Well, if after all this,

94
00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:43,842
Daon still said no,

95
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:46,240
there's nothing I can do.

96
00:06:47,116 --> 00:06:48,276
What are you scheming?

97
00:06:49,035 --> 00:06:50,324
Think whatever you want.

98
00:06:50,995 --> 00:06:52,385
I'm done now.

(Albi Construction)

100
00:07:02,924 --> 00:07:04,078
Good morning.

101
00:07:04,103 --> 00:07:05,635
- Hello.
- Hello.

102
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:07,369
Hello.

103
00:07:07,852 --> 00:07:09,104
Hello.

104
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:10,888
- Hello.
- Hello.

105
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:18,621
Alright. Since Assistant Manager Ju

106
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,874
is taking the day off due to illness,

107
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,986
if you need anything,

108
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:23,233
ask Assistant Manager Jung

109
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,379
or Assistant Manager Park.

110
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:26,019
And Assistant Manager Jung, report to me

111
00:07:26,026 --> 00:07:27,645
right after your client meeting today.

112
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,545
The meeting just ended.

113
00:07:41,337 --> 00:07:43,102
I'll report back as soon as I return.

114
00:07:47,192 --> 00:07:49,058
I'll be waiting.

115
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:12,228
Assistant Manager Ju.

116
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:14,978
Assistant Manager Ju.

117
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,425
I was worried, so I came.

118
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:30,534
Where does it hurt? How bad is it?

119
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:31,762
Did you take any medicine?

120
00:08:33,563 --> 00:08:34,813
Assistant Manager Ju.

121
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:36,367
About yesterday,

122
00:08:36,374 --> 00:08:37,461
it was all a misunderstanding...

123
00:08:37,486 --> 00:08:38,706
A misunderstanding?

124
00:08:39,407 --> 00:08:40,480
Let me explain everything.

125
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,649
No need.

126
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:43,407
You don't need to explain.

127
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:46,579
I understand your feelings well now.

128
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,572
I had hope.

129
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:53,201
I rushed to you with hope.

130
00:08:54,285 --> 00:08:55,783
I've been waiting for you for hours,

131
00:08:55,808 --> 00:08:57,010
wondering where you were

132
00:08:57,023 --> 00:08:58,190
and what you were doing.

133
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,750
Did something bad happen?

134
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:03,101
I was worrying myself sick.

135
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,120
I should've stopped when you told me to.

136
00:09:11,462 --> 00:09:12,880
Honestly, I regret it.

137
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:18,059
I won't hold you back anymore.

138
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,269
I'll stop here.

139
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:22,613
I'll do as you want.

140
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:29,066
Please leave now.

141
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,019
I'd prefer it if you didn't come again.

142
00:09:52,969 --> 00:09:55,096
Assistant Manager Jung! Water!

143
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:09,235
Isn't that person?

144
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,713
The recruit with connection?

145
00:10:21,108 --> 00:10:22,498
Assistant Manager Jung.

146
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,503
Did you see the post?

147
00:10:28,546 --> 00:10:29,647
The post?

148
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:30,756
Yeah.

149
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,265
(Al Construction Hiring Corruption
and Power Abuse Exposed)

150
00:10:41,381 --> 00:10:42,256
The head of the

151
00:10:42,289 --> 00:10:43,662
strategic planning
department at Al Construction

152
00:10:43,687 --> 00:10:44,722
and Assistant Manager J

153
00:10:44,736 --> 00:10:45,706
were from the same university.

154
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,210
The department head nearly went

155
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,780
to jail for assaulting someone over J,

156
00:10:48,804 --> 00:10:50,167
but used family connections
to study abroad instead.

157
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:51,103
A few years later,

158
00:10:51,124 --> 00:10:52,467
J got hired at Al Construction.

159
00:10:52,491 --> 00:10:54,572
Didn't they obviously use connection?

160
00:10:54,572 --> 00:10:56,198
I was the victim of that incident.

161
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:58,075
Recently, the Al Construction
department head

162
00:10:58,075 --> 00:10:59,181
canceled a contract with

163
00:10:59,195 --> 00:11:00,319
our company at the last minute.

164
00:11:00,343 --> 00:11:01,898
He said it was because of me.

165
00:11:03,122 --> 00:11:04,685
Getting assigned to a good department

166
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:06,059
because of family or school connections
is disgusting.

167
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,092
That J-guy must have

168
00:11:07,113 --> 00:11:08,395
an insanely thick skin.

169
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:10,296
Must be pretty useless at work too.

170
00:11:10,296 --> 00:11:11,442
These days, connections are

171
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:12,569
part of the qualifications.

172
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:25,687
Well, if after all this,

173
00:11:25,701 --> 00:11:27,221
Daon still said no,

174
00:11:28,497 --> 00:11:29,540
there's nothing I can do.

175
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:30,608
Think whatever you want.

176
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,817
I'm done now.

177
00:11:37,783 --> 00:11:39,260
Is it because of Park Junghoon?

178
00:11:39,285 --> 00:11:40,661
The collapsed contract
with Pilgang Construction...

179
00:11:40,686 --> 00:11:42,204
That bastard Park Junghoon said that?

180
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:43,497
Damn it, I told him never to

181
00:11:43,524 --> 00:11:44,931
show up in front of me again.

182
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:46,515
Why did you do that?

183
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,100
That's all in the past, isn't it?

184
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,416
If it's in the past...

185
00:11:49,747 --> 00:11:51,065
Does it mean it will disappear?

186
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:52,838
And why can't it disappear?

187
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:55,689
If this is all because you're bitter

188
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,076
about going abroad for school,

189
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,805
then I'm sorry.

190
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,891
It was my call that got you in trouble.

191
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:05,131
Do you really think I'm doing this

192
00:12:05,151 --> 00:12:06,036
because of going abroad?

193
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,677
Then what is it about?

194
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:10,606
Back then and even now...

195
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:12,805
You and Jaemin hyung

196
00:12:12,812 --> 00:12:13,865
keep things from me,

197
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:15,087
never telling me the truth.

198
00:12:15,111 --> 00:12:16,571
How am I supposed to know anything?

199
00:12:17,113 --> 00:12:18,614
If you had told me the truth back then.

200
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:19,715
If I had?

201
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,153
What could you have done?

202
00:12:21,629 --> 00:12:22,995
All you ever do is show up

203
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:24,689
and whine like this.

204
00:12:24,862 --> 00:12:26,305
No.

205
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,015
- I would've tried to do...
- No.

206
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,582
You couldn't have.

207
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:31,857
What matters now is

208
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:34,108
not whether the truth

209
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:35,462
was told back then,

210
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,212
but now that you know

211
00:12:37,675 --> 00:12:38,968
are you coming to me or not?

212
00:12:40,094 --> 00:12:41,469
That's what's important.

213
00:13:01,054 --> 00:13:02,097
This is all your fault.

214
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,600
Because you like to open

215
00:13:03,607 --> 00:13:04,900
your heart to people easily.

216
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,094
So I had to resort to this.

217
00:13:13,341 --> 00:13:14,801
I should've stopped when you told me to.

218
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:16,881
Honestly, I regret it.

219
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:19,592
I'd prefer it if you didn't come again.

220
00:13:22,675 --> 00:13:23,696
No.

221
00:13:23,721 --> 00:13:24,905
What could you have done?

222
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,265
You couldn't have.

223
00:13:27,656 --> 00:13:29,128
It's all my fault.

224
00:13:29,841 --> 00:13:31,622
I don't deserve to love

225
00:13:32,737 --> 00:13:34,655
or to be loved.

226
00:13:36,852 --> 00:13:38,319
Everyone around me just ends up

227
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,013
miserable and suffering.

228
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:52,917
Are you okay?

229
00:13:53,431 --> 00:13:54,985
Daon...

230
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:58,063
What did you say?

231
00:14:00,182 --> 00:14:01,391
Grandma?

232
00:14:05,264 --> 00:14:06,507
Oh dear...

233
00:14:06,893 --> 00:14:08,728
You're burning up, like fire.

234
00:14:09,326 --> 00:14:12,163
I'll go make you some porridge.

235
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:21,667
Eat.

236
00:14:26,784 --> 00:14:28,636
What's troubling you so much

237
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:30,621
that you've made yourself sick?

238
00:14:33,838 --> 00:14:35,009
When your heart hurts,

239
00:14:35,022 --> 00:14:36,702
don't keep it all inside.

240
00:14:37,253 --> 00:14:38,837
If you do, it'll fester.

241
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:58,023
I did everything I could...

242
00:14:59,161 --> 00:15:00,314
If something isn't working,

243
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:01,745
then maybe it just isn't meant to be.

244
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,724
I don't think I'm the one.

245
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,290
So I told them I'll stop.

246
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:12,974
I did the right thing, didn't I?

247
00:15:13,165 --> 00:15:14,529
I did the well, right?

248
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,712
Oh dear, you did well.

249
00:15:19,712 --> 00:15:21,145
My dear child,

250
00:15:21,165 --> 00:15:23,518
you've been through so much.

251
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:31,107
Wow, Grandma, just one hug from you

252
00:15:31,127 --> 00:15:32,394
and I already feel better.

253
00:15:32,944 --> 00:15:35,160
I should hurry up and eat this porridge
and take my medicine.

254
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:36,247
That's right.

255
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:39,028
Eat up.

256
00:15:39,088 --> 00:15:40,396
I'll go...

257
00:15:41,615 --> 00:15:42,943
brew some tea.

258
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:00,461
It's a shame you're quitting

259
00:16:00,488 --> 00:16:01,488
so suddenly.

260
00:16:02,536 --> 00:16:03,836
I figured I'd take a break

261
00:16:03,856 --> 00:16:05,136
while I'm at it.

262
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:07,009
Have you decided where you'll travel?

263
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:10,095
I think I'll be going far away.

264
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:11,912
I don't think I'll be back

265
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:13,095
for a long time.

266
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:14,119
I'm just going to wrap

267
00:16:14,126 --> 00:16:15,035
everything up and leave.

268
00:16:15,072 --> 00:16:16,143
Stay in touch.

269
00:16:16,352 --> 00:16:18,020
I'll keep a spot open for you.

270
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:19,438
Thank you.

271
00:16:40,555 --> 00:16:42,977
Did my puppy get to work safely?

272
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,336
Have you recovered?

273
00:16:44,361 --> 00:16:45,862
Thanks to Grandma, I feel all better

274
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:47,053
and I'm heading to work.

275
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,538
You don't have to worry.

276
00:16:50,062 --> 00:16:52,558
(Assistant Manager Jung)

277
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,133
Assistant Manager Ju.

278
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:14,468
Here's the data you requested.

279
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:15,732
Ah, yes.

280
00:17:16,445 --> 00:17:17,529
Ms. Mina.

281
00:17:18,091 --> 00:17:19,418
Is Assistant Manager Jung working

282
00:17:19,443 --> 00:17:20,911
outside the office today?

283
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:23,317
I think he's not coming in

284
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,675
because of what happened yesterday.

285
00:17:26,388 --> 00:17:27,453
What happened?

286
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:30,187
Yesterday, there was a huge fuss

287
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,500
because of an exposé about

288
00:17:31,527 --> 00:17:33,196
Assistant Manager Jung and the Director.

289
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,312
It said they knew

290
00:17:34,326 --> 00:17:35,573
each other from university.

291
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:36,625
But the post had

292
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,169
a lot of problematic claims…

293
00:17:38,209 --> 00:17:39,598
So [people are saying he got into

294
00:17:39,605 --> 00:17:40,954
the company through connections,

295
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:42,730
and that's how he joined the TF team.

296
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,394
There are tons of rumors going around.

297
00:17:51,447 --> 00:17:52,712
Are you okay?

298
00:17:52,865 --> 00:17:54,049
Assistant Manager Ju?

299
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:56,218
For the resort project bid presentation,

300
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:57,411
I think you should

301
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,221
prepare well for it.

302
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:00,699
Wasn't Assistant Manager Jung

303
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:01,819
supposed to present?

304
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:03,556
Well, it looks like

305
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,252
he's going to leave the TF team.

306
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:07,173
Because of yesterday's incident,

307
00:18:07,198 --> 00:18:08,918
the higher-ups don't see him favorably.

308
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:11,175
So he wants to step down himself.

309
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:13,986
We don't have much time
before the presentation,

310
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:15,951
just endure it for a bit.

311
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,152
Watch where you're going.

312
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:31,501
For a Director, you don't seem

313
00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:32,601
very interested in

314
00:18:32,626 --> 00:18:33,906
protecting your employees.

315
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:36,116
Protecting employees?

316
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:37,416
Do you realize how difficult

317
00:18:37,441 --> 00:18:38,721
this is for him?

318
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:40,766
Because of the post on

319
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:41,904
the community board.

320
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,835
Our company is quite free-spirited, huh?

321
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,155
An ordinary employee daring

322
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,439
to criticize their superior.

323
00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:51,327
Whether I protect or defend

324
00:18:51,354 --> 00:18:52,740
that employee, that's for me

325
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:54,320
as the director to decide.

326
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,567
A mere employee should stay out of it.

327
00:18:56,762 --> 00:18:57,875
Make yourself clear

328
00:18:57,882 --> 00:18:58,988
so I can stop caring.

329
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:01,554
If Assistant Manager Jung

330
00:19:01,579 --> 00:19:02,985
gets removed from the TF team,

331
00:19:04,111 --> 00:19:05,779
I won't just stand by and watch.

332
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:08,732
Jung Daon is leaving the TF team?

333
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:12,401
That's great.

334
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:14,088
I wasn't happy with it.

335
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,714
Great, you say?

336
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:16,772
Assistant Manager Jung

337
00:19:16,792 --> 00:19:17,872
hasn't even come to work,

338
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,045
and you say that's great?

339
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:29,545
He didn't come to work?

340
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:40,054
Please take me to Yongsan,

341
00:19:40,068 --> 00:19:41,074
Shinhui Apartments.

342
00:19:42,884 --> 00:19:45,253
Whenever I feel uneasy,

343
00:19:45,278 --> 00:19:46,281
there is this hill

344
00:19:46,306 --> 00:19:47,530
I used to go up often.

345
00:19:47,556 --> 00:19:48,845
That place

346
00:19:49,274 --> 00:19:50,526
feels like a refuge.

347
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:52,835
Ah, driver, please take me to Mujundong

348
00:19:52,842 --> 00:19:53,882
instead of Yongsan.

349
00:20:03,766 --> 00:20:04,979
Jung Daon!

350
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:06,394
Hey!

351
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,336
The number you have dialed
is unavailable.

352
00:20:12,343 --> 00:20:13,876
Please leave a message after the beep.

353
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,131
Assistant Manager Ju, why are you here?

354
00:20:56,494 --> 00:20:57,927
You said you come here whenever

355
00:20:57,948 --> 00:20:59,020
you feel uneasy.

356
00:21:04,465 --> 00:21:05,758
Are you going to run away again?

357
00:21:05,783 --> 00:21:08,619
- You think hiding will solve anything?
- Let go of me.

358
00:21:08,644 --> 00:21:10,666
You worked so hard to prepare for it,

359
00:21:10,691 --> 00:21:12,397
how can you just give up so easily?

360
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:15,500
I'm sorry.

361
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:17,100
Don't apologize to me.

362
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,289
You should be apologizing to yourself.

363
00:21:20,161 --> 00:21:21,704
You said you finally had a dream.

364
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:24,368
You promised to work hard together.

365
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,330
How can you give up so easily?

366
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:33,929
Assistant Manager Ju,

367
00:21:33,954 --> 00:21:35,396
you heard the rumors too, right?

368
00:21:36,355 --> 00:21:37,648
How am I supposed to just keep working

369
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:38,701
and take charge of the

370
00:21:38,728 --> 00:21:39,994
TF like nothing happened?

371
00:21:40,842 --> 00:21:41,982
I...

372
00:21:44,358 --> 00:21:45,693
have no right.

373
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:50,494
I can't do it.

374
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:52,371
Who decides who has the right?

375
00:21:52,396 --> 00:21:53,382
Why do you assume you

376
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:54,453
can't do it before even trying?

377
00:21:54,478 --> 00:21:55,902
Then what exactly am I supposed

378
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:56,976
to do in this situation?

379
00:21:58,714 --> 00:22:00,159
You can do anything.

380
00:22:06,948 --> 00:22:08,225
So please...

381
00:22:11,092 --> 00:22:12,584
Stop running away.

382
00:22:48,744 --> 00:22:50,783
Are you trying to drive me insane?

383
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:52,550
Where the hell were you

384
00:22:52,575 --> 00:22:54,775
that you didn't answer my calls?

385
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:00,547
If you disappear without
a word one more time,

386
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:01,829
I won't just let it slide...

387
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:06,319
I heard you're leaving the TF team.

388
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:08,388
Then come work under me?

389
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:10,075
I'm not leaving the TF team.

390
00:23:11,221 --> 00:23:13,005
I'm going to make sure we win the bid

391
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:14,561
and achieve my dream.

392
00:23:15,604 --> 00:23:16,847
So I won't let down the people

393
00:23:16,867 --> 00:23:17,732
who believe in me.

394
00:23:17,756 --> 00:23:20,816
- And I will definitely go over...
- Why do you keep trying to go overseas?

395
00:23:21,176 --> 00:23:22,221
Why do you keep trying

396
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:23,171
to escape from me?

397
00:23:23,195 --> 00:23:24,754
Because I feel like that's the only way

398
00:23:24,781 --> 00:23:25,847
I can truly find myself!

399
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:28,516
What?

400
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:30,774
I want to try living on my own.

401
00:23:32,991 --> 00:23:34,367
Without you...

402
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,237
without Jaemin hyung.

403
00:23:57,938 --> 00:23:59,106
Yes, Director.

404
00:23:59,106 --> 00:24:00,565
Get ready.

405
00:24:00,565 --> 00:24:02,471
We need to proceed as planned.

406
00:24:07,917 --> 00:24:09,964
(Albi Construction)

407
00:24:18,385 --> 00:24:19,971
(Jaemin hyung)

408
00:24:31,901 --> 00:24:33,169
Hello?

409
00:24:33,194 --> 00:24:34,686
I'm sorry about what happened.

410
00:24:35,261 --> 00:24:37,190
I think I lost my mind for a moment.

411
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,275
As soon as I woke up in the hospital,

412
00:24:41,296 --> 00:24:42,575
I wanted to apologize.

413
00:24:45,444 --> 00:24:46,570
But you weren't there.

414
00:24:47,366 --> 00:24:48,822
I had something urgent to handle.

415
00:24:48,822 --> 00:24:49,962
Daon.

416
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:53,163
I think I'll be leaving soon.

417
00:24:54,828 --> 00:24:56,101
Leaving?

418
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,195
Yeah.

419
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:01,168
It seems like the best choice.

420
00:25:04,266 --> 00:25:05,462
Take care.

421
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:07,549
Be well.

422
00:25:31,335 --> 00:25:32,788
- Umm...
- Assistant Manager!

423
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,134
Are you okay?

424
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,718
I was worried.

425
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:37,682
A client called.

426
00:25:56,014 --> 00:25:57,515
This material looks good,

427
00:25:57,515 --> 00:25:58,642
look at the blueprint again.

428
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:02,124
When reviewing the blueprint...

429
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:05,182
Assistant Manager Ju.

430
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,209
Can you check this for a moment?

431
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:07,399
Ah...

432
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,193
I think the details at

433
00:26:09,207 --> 00:26:10,171
the end aren't enough.

434
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:11,455
What do you think?

435
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:12,942
The parking lot is too small

436
00:26:12,963 --> 00:26:14,300
compared to car usage rates.

437
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:16,977
And for the elderly and disabled...

438
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:45,831
(Presenting the bidding for the
construction project of Dubai Resort 2024)

439
00:27:49,591 --> 00:27:51,800
(Presenting the bidding for the
construction project of Dubai Resort 2024)

440
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:09,923
You can begin the presentation now.

441
00:28:09,948 --> 00:28:11,054
You just need to turn on

442
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:12,508
the mic when you're ready.

443
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,652
- You're from Albi Construction, right?
- Yes.

444
00:28:39,677 --> 00:28:41,141
Has Director Kim Kim Suhyeon

445
00:28:41,162 --> 00:28:42,522
not arrived yet?

446
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:45,183
Ah... Just a moment.

447
00:28:45,183 --> 00:28:46,448
Yes.

448
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:53,782
The number you have dialed
is unavailable.

449
00:28:53,807 --> 00:28:55,487
Please leave a message after the beep.

450
00:28:57,899 --> 00:28:59,328
He's probably to be on his way.

451
00:28:59,355 --> 00:29:01,070
I'll inform you as soon as he arrives.

452
00:29:01,094 --> 00:29:02,428
Ah, I see. Thank you.

453
00:29:09,955 --> 00:29:11,250
Let's go.

454
00:29:19,634 --> 00:29:21,094
Where are you?

455
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:31,139
It's ready.

456
00:29:44,868 --> 00:29:46,381
Ah, and I think the phrasing about

457
00:29:46,406 --> 00:29:47,765
property value is too direct.

458
00:29:48,872 --> 00:29:50,373
I'm planning to adjust it a bit...

459
00:29:54,043 --> 00:29:55,277
Before I leave the country,

460
00:29:55,291 --> 00:29:56,397
I have something to give you.

461
00:29:56,421 --> 00:29:57,672
Do you have a moment?

462
00:29:57,964 --> 00:29:59,730
I happen to be near where you are.

463
00:29:59,924 --> 00:30:01,449
I'll meet you at
the underground parking lot.

464
00:30:03,052 --> 00:30:04,255
Okay.

465
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:12,190
Umm...

466
00:30:12,896 --> 00:30:13,922
I need to step out to the

467
00:30:13,947 --> 00:30:15,206
underground parking lot for a moment.

468
00:30:15,232 --> 00:30:16,804
Ah, okay. Go ahead.

469
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:18,301
I'll start preparing for

470
00:30:18,308 --> 00:30:19,668
the rehearsal in the meantime.

471
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,290
By any chance...

472
00:30:33,507 --> 00:30:34,800
After the presentation,

473
00:30:35,418 --> 00:30:37,045
could you spare me a moment?

474
00:30:38,969 --> 00:30:40,226
I have something to say.

475
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:46,819
Then I'll be going now.

476
00:30:46,844 --> 00:30:47,886
Okay.

477
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,897
The traffic is a bit heavy.

478
00:31:15,197 --> 00:31:16,517
I'll be there soon.

479
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,176
Albi Construction,

480
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,323
let's start the rehearsal.

481
00:31:32,637 --> 00:31:33,855
Okay.

482
00:33:38,303 --> 00:33:39,535
Daon.

483
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,858
Come write your wish, too.

484
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:42,446
You said you wanted to

485
00:33:42,467 --> 00:33:43,320
hang it on the tree.

486
00:33:47,631 --> 00:33:49,514
I just said that in passing.

487
00:33:50,822 --> 00:33:52,740
I didn't think you'd remember.

488
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,020
Wanting to write your wishes

489
00:33:54,045 --> 00:33:55,093
just like a kid.

490
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:58,871
I saw in dramas,

491
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:00,772
people always write wishes and

492
00:34:00,797 --> 00:34:02,278
hang them on the Christmas tree, right?

493
00:34:02,303 --> 00:34:03,398
Then the next morning,

494
00:34:03,432 --> 00:34:04,638
there are piles of presents.

495
00:34:05,425 --> 00:34:06,571
It's something that would

496
00:34:06,591 --> 00:34:07,606
never happen in my home.

497
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,090
I've always wanted to try it.

498
00:34:43,736 --> 00:34:45,030
- This.
- This?

499
00:34:45,055 --> 00:34:46,371
Got it.

500
00:34:58,481 --> 00:35:00,775
Wait, let me hang it up first then look.

501
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,351
- Alright, alright.
- No, that one.

502
00:35:03,644 --> 00:35:04,784
Huh?

503
00:35:06,644 --> 00:35:07,824
It's snowing.

504
00:35:33,552 --> 00:35:36,361
(Please make us happy)

505
00:35:37,864 --> 00:35:40,728
(May we all be happy)

506
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:50,324
(May we be together until the
moment we leave this world)
