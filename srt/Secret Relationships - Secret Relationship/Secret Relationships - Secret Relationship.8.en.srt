1
00:00:44,613 --> 00:00:46,164
You woke up earlier than I expected.

2
00:00:48,524 --> 00:00:49,524
Hyung.

3
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,750
Hyung.

4
00:01:04,966 --> 00:01:06,333
Why are you doing this?

5
00:01:08,136 --> 00:01:09,942
- What are you doing?
- It's today.

6
00:01:10,263 --> 00:01:11,395
Huh?

7
00:01:11,973 --> 00:01:13,303
The day the wish we made on

8
00:01:13,328 --> 00:01:14,469
Christmas comes true.

9
00:01:18,021 --> 00:01:19,341
Don't you remember?

10
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,484
We made a wish together here.

11
00:01:25,528 --> 00:01:26,821
Since that day,

12
00:01:27,906 --> 00:01:29,152
I wished for it to come true

13
00:01:29,177 --> 00:01:30,703
every single day without fail.

14
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:32,784
A wish?

15
00:01:34,287 --> 00:01:35,773
What was it?

16
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,890
(May we be together until the
moment we leave this world)

17
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,500
"Secret Relationships"

18
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,300
(Episode 8)

19
00:02:04,901 --> 00:02:05,897
The number you are

20
00:02:05,931 --> 00:02:07,311
trying to reach is unavailable.

21
00:02:07,325 --> 00:02:08,130
After the beep...

22
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,537
Where did he go?

23
00:02:15,662 --> 00:02:16,728
I don't think I can do

24
00:02:16,742 --> 00:02:17,973
the presentation today.

25
00:02:17,997 --> 00:02:19,377
I've done enough.

26
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,084
I just want to stop now.

27
00:02:26,339 --> 00:02:27,846
Please pick up.

28
00:02:28,883 --> 00:02:29,938
The number you are

29
00:02:29,963 --> 00:02:31,385
trying to reach is unavailable.

30
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,827
Jung Daon is leaving the TF team?

31
00:02:35,174 --> 00:02:36,567
That's great.

32
00:02:36,605 --> 00:02:38,085
I wasn't happy with it.

33
00:02:55,744 --> 00:02:57,364
Give me the money first.

34
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:04,811
Once I confirm the deposit, then...

35
00:03:04,836 --> 00:03:05,914
No.

36
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:08,672
If you use this for the presentation

37
00:03:08,697 --> 00:03:10,392
and we get suspected of plagiarism

38
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:11,857
and lose the bid,

39
00:03:12,135 --> 00:03:13,424
then,

40
00:03:13,762 --> 00:03:15,138
you get the money.

41
00:03:15,444 --> 00:03:17,240
- Kim Suhyeon.
- You can't meet him right now.

42
00:03:17,265 --> 00:03:19,156
- Go back.
- I know he's in there.

43
00:03:19,565 --> 00:03:20,638
Kim Suhyeon.

44
00:03:20,755 --> 00:03:21,798
Come out!

45
00:03:28,324 --> 00:03:30,183
- What the hell are you doing?
- Where is he?

46
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:32,707
- What?
- Where is Assistant Manager Jung?

47
00:03:33,406 --> 00:03:35,049
What did you do?

48
00:03:35,074 --> 00:03:36,868
What did you do to make him
suddenly disappear!?

49
00:03:36,868 --> 00:03:38,044
Speak so I can understand.

50
00:03:38,161 --> 00:03:39,329
Don't pretend you don't know,
just tell me...

51
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:41,077
I really don't know!

52
00:03:41,956 --> 00:03:44,202
Tell me properly what happened.

53
00:03:47,128 --> 00:03:49,200
Are you saying Jung Daon disappeared?

54
00:03:54,302 --> 00:03:55,720
I've done enough.

55
00:03:56,005 --> 00:03:57,424
I just want to stop now.

56
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,232
I've done enough.

57
00:04:00,475 --> 00:04:01,740
Think whatever you want.

58
00:04:02,128 --> 00:04:03,463
I'm done now.

59
00:04:09,234 --> 00:04:10,902
Go to Inae University right now.

60
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,657
Check if Shin Jaemin came to work.

61
00:04:12,682 --> 00:04:13,713
Why Shin Jaemin?

62
00:04:13,738 --> 00:04:15,229
Do you have a lead or something?

63
00:04:22,038 --> 00:04:23,116
Hyung.

64
00:04:23,957 --> 00:04:24,999
Can we talk for a second?

65
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,935
Why are you doing this?

66
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,850
You didn't have to go this far.

67
00:04:29,295 --> 00:04:31,128
When I said I was grateful,

68
00:04:31,602 --> 00:04:32,748
I really meant it.

69
00:04:33,466 --> 00:04:35,616
I always thought I had to repay you.

70
00:04:37,637 --> 00:04:39,038
The day we first met.

71
00:04:39,264 --> 00:04:40,410
When you first asked me

72
00:04:40,424 --> 00:04:41,710
if I needed tutoring.

73
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,881
- From that moment on...
- No.

74
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:48,271
That wasn't the first time I saw you.

75
00:04:50,441 --> 00:04:52,443
I've known you since high school.

76
00:04:55,036 --> 00:04:56,271
Hey, over here!

77
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:09,451
But...

78
00:05:10,545 --> 00:05:11,671
I waited.

79
00:05:13,882 --> 00:05:16,134
I waited until you truly wanted me.

80
00:05:17,927 --> 00:05:19,679
And then I finally came to your side.

81
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:42,007
Now you understand, right?

82
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,644
I was the first one to know you.

83
00:05:44,704 --> 00:05:45,943
So the person who should be

84
00:05:45,957 --> 00:05:46,996
by your side is me.

85
00:06:07,644 --> 00:06:10,097
Why the sudden photos?

86
00:06:11,773 --> 00:06:13,775
I have to record our love.

87
00:06:15,777 --> 00:06:17,142
I'm going to keep them in a place where

88
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:18,273
they'll never disappear.

89
00:06:29,123 --> 00:06:30,722
So, smile a little.

90
00:06:32,418 --> 00:06:33,972
This is a happy moment, isn't it?

91
00:06:50,269 --> 00:06:51,777
Dammit!

92
00:06:59,112 --> 00:07:01,213
Not here. What about there?

93
00:07:01,322 --> 00:07:02,604
Not here either.

94
00:07:05,702 --> 00:07:07,053
Damn. I'll hang up for now.

95
00:07:07,078 --> 00:07:08,304
What do we do now?

96
00:07:08,329 --> 00:07:10,319
- Check Daon's house...
- That probably won't help.

97
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,059
- What?
- It looks like a planned kidnapping.

98
00:07:13,084 --> 00:07:14,417
They wouldn't have taken him

99
00:07:14,437 --> 00:07:15,564
somewhere easy to find.

100
00:07:15,878 --> 00:07:17,239
Is there any place Shin Jaemin

101
00:07:17,266 --> 00:07:18,419
might consider a hideout?

102
00:07:18,686 --> 00:07:21,045
- Anywhere?
- How would I know?

103
00:07:24,101 --> 00:07:25,957
There is one place that comes to mind.

104
00:07:44,365 --> 00:07:45,742
I just don't get it.

105
00:07:46,284 --> 00:07:47,370
You were the one who

106
00:07:47,395 --> 00:07:48,581
rejected my confession.

107
00:07:52,248 --> 00:07:54,435
The reason why I rejected you,

108
00:07:55,543 --> 00:07:57,175
you know it better than anyone.

109
00:07:59,047 --> 00:08:02,343
I knew exactly who you had feelings for.

110
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:04,417
Even when you tried to hide it,

111
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,122
I knew who you liked.

112
00:08:07,096 --> 00:08:08,264
I knew everything.

113
00:08:08,264 --> 00:08:09,607
What are you talking about?

114
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,006
What did you like about Kim Suhyeon?

115
00:08:17,565 --> 00:08:18,685
Back then...

116
00:08:19,025 --> 00:08:20,860
I didn't know you had feelings for him.

117
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,820
I never liked him, Daon.

118
00:08:24,072 --> 00:08:25,697
The reason we dated, no...

119
00:08:26,157 --> 00:08:27,759
The reason we pretended to date

120
00:08:28,993 --> 00:08:30,620
was all to have you.

121
00:08:32,205 --> 00:08:33,431
Pretended

122
00:08:34,207 --> 00:08:35,478
to date?

123
00:08:38,127 --> 00:08:40,296
Because that way, you'd come back to me.

124
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,888
Daon.

125
00:08:52,391 --> 00:08:53,884
I only wanted one thing.

126
00:08:55,645 --> 00:08:57,018
For you to never leave my side,

127
00:08:57,043 --> 00:08:58,178
no matter what happens.

128
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:01,985
But you…

129
00:09:04,487 --> 00:09:06,197
You kept letting me down.

130
00:09:10,576 --> 00:09:12,630
Why do you keep giving in to temptation?

131
00:09:14,038 --> 00:09:15,957
Why do you keep falling for others?

132
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,392
Just...

133
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:20,684
You just have to look at me.

134
00:09:21,212 --> 00:09:22,879
Such a simple thing...

135
00:09:23,047 --> 00:09:24,614
Why?

136
00:09:28,136 --> 00:09:29,595
Why can't you do it?

137
00:09:30,471 --> 00:09:31,494
Huh?

138
00:09:33,975 --> 00:09:35,029
Hyung.

139
00:09:35,054 --> 00:09:36,110
I will forgive you

140
00:09:36,135 --> 00:09:37,815
for belittling our love

141
00:09:38,521 --> 00:09:39,914
and go to that place together.

142
00:09:39,939 --> 00:09:41,536
A place where no one will interfere,

143
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:43,442
where no one will lure you.

144
00:09:44,402 --> 00:09:46,591
There, we can love each other forever.

145
00:09:48,156 --> 00:09:49,448
Please, stop, hyung.

146
00:09:51,641 --> 00:09:53,244
Please. I beg you.

147
00:09:56,873 --> 00:09:57,911
It'll be over soon,

148
00:09:57,936 --> 00:09:59,115
just hold on a little longer.

149
00:10:12,972 --> 00:10:14,115
Hyung.

150
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,432
No, right?

151
00:10:16,058 --> 00:10:17,808
This isn't right!

152
00:10:52,094 --> 00:10:53,604
Hyung, stop!

153
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,341
Is someone there?

154
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:13,407
Wow, there really is someone here.

155
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:16,177
This place has been empty for years.

156
00:11:16,202 --> 00:11:18,204
And I saw a car I didn't recognize.

157
00:11:18,204 --> 00:11:19,788
I almost thought

158
00:11:19,802 --> 00:11:21,642
it was a thief or something.

159
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:22,970
Ah...

160
00:11:23,626 --> 00:11:24,971
I just got back from overseas

161
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:26,425
after a long time, so I...

162
00:11:27,838 --> 00:11:29,148
Do you live nearby?

163
00:11:29,173 --> 00:11:31,384
Ah, the green-roofed house over there.

164
00:11:32,218 --> 00:11:33,762
It's such a remote mountain village...

165
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:35,017
Not many people come here.

166
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:35,950
It's very quiet.

167
00:11:39,642 --> 00:11:40,935
Right, but anyway...

168
00:11:43,145 --> 00:11:44,372
Ah...

169
00:11:44,397 --> 00:11:46,094
I have something to take care of...

170
00:11:47,942 --> 00:11:49,360
I'm in a bit of a hurry right now...

171
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,378
What do you do?

172
00:11:50,403 --> 00:11:51,736
Do you work at some company

173
00:11:51,761 --> 00:11:52,801
or something?

174
00:11:55,241 --> 00:11:56,701
I make great jujube tea.

175
00:12:12,925 --> 00:12:14,354
What are you doing?

176
00:12:16,971 --> 00:12:18,323
Don't come.

177
00:12:23,728 --> 00:12:24,912
Are you trying to run?

178
00:12:24,937 --> 00:12:26,770
Please stop, hyung.

179
00:12:27,773 --> 00:12:28,962
Daon.

180
00:12:30,443 --> 00:12:32,699
I believe we have our own world.

181
00:12:35,948 --> 00:12:37,580
Let's go there.

182
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,677
Then everything will be okay.

183
00:12:39,702 --> 00:12:40,886
No.

184
00:12:40,911 --> 00:12:42,319
I don't want to go.

185
00:12:51,547 --> 00:12:52,856
Shin Jaemin!

186
00:12:57,136 --> 00:12:58,404
You're interfering again?

187
00:12:58,429 --> 00:12:59,395
Even at the very end,

188
00:12:59,429 --> 00:13:00,657
you're coming between us?

189
00:13:00,681 --> 00:13:01,835
Put the knife down.

190
00:13:01,862 --> 00:13:03,118
Put that down and we'll...

191
00:13:03,142 --> 00:13:05,786
I was the first one to know Daon.

192
00:13:05,811 --> 00:13:07,872
Not you, not that bastard!

193
00:13:07,897 --> 00:13:09,362
Me!

194
00:13:11,192 --> 00:13:13,373
So why should I give up?

195
00:13:13,778 --> 00:13:15,043
Huh?

196
00:13:56,237 --> 00:13:57,713
That bastard.

197
00:14:15,177 --> 00:14:16,236
No.

198
00:14:16,261 --> 00:14:17,365
No.

199
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,177
No.

200
00:14:21,887 --> 00:14:23,144
I'm sorry.

201
00:14:24,723 --> 00:14:26,433
I should have come sooner.

202
00:14:28,936 --> 00:14:30,558
I'm not worth that much.

203
00:14:33,357 --> 00:14:34,911
Why would you go this far to save me?

204
00:14:37,945 --> 00:14:39,320
Daon.

205
00:14:41,532 --> 00:14:42,720
For me, what matters more

206
00:14:42,728 --> 00:14:43,900
is that you're safe.

207
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,093
Seonghyeon.

208
00:14:51,584 --> 00:14:52,632
Ju Seonghyeon.

209
00:14:55,045 --> 00:14:56,710
Seonghyeon.

210
00:15:10,603 --> 00:15:12,001
Are you awake?

211
00:15:25,743 --> 00:15:27,661
That time, when I said I regretted it...

212
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:31,957
I didn't mean it.

213
00:15:35,628 --> 00:15:36,712
Since I met you,

214
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:40,612
I've never regretted anything, not once.

215
00:15:43,761 --> 00:15:44,979
I was happy.

216
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,178
Really, thank you.

217
00:15:52,394 --> 00:15:53,646
For letting me love you.

218
00:15:56,732 --> 00:15:57,950
Me too.

219
00:15:58,776 --> 00:16:00,263
Pushing you away...

220
00:16:00,992 --> 00:16:02,448
I didn't mean it.

221
00:16:04,615 --> 00:16:05,685
I'm sorry.

222
00:16:07,707 --> 00:16:09,523
For making it hard for you.

223
00:16:11,872 --> 00:16:13,541
For hurting you, for pushing you away.

224
00:16:15,751 --> 00:16:17,086
I'm really sorry.

225
00:16:24,426 --> 00:16:25,700
Go through with the surgery.

226
00:16:26,554 --> 00:16:28,138
I won't go anywhere until it's over.

227
00:16:28,138 --> 00:16:29,247
Go.

228
00:16:30,015 --> 00:16:31,141
Your presentation is soon.

229
00:16:34,562 --> 00:16:35,830
Idiot, how can I go

230
00:16:35,855 --> 00:16:37,337
and leave you behind?

231
00:16:40,359 --> 00:16:41,647
If you care about me...

232
00:16:43,696 --> 00:16:44,905
You have to present it.

233
00:16:45,322 --> 00:16:47,390
Seonghyeon, I beg you.

234
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:05,890
Oh crap!

235
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,570
Are you insane?

236
00:17:07,595 --> 00:17:09,071
How could you do something like that?

237
00:17:09,096 --> 00:17:11,165
How could you even
think about killing him?

238
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,243
Open the door!

239
00:17:12,268 --> 00:17:14,088
- I wasn't trying to kill him.
- Open the door!

240
00:17:15,436 --> 00:17:17,021
I was going to die with him.

241
00:17:18,011 --> 00:17:19,599
I was always ready to sacrifice

242
00:17:19,624 --> 00:17:21,473
my life for Daon.

243
00:17:21,734 --> 00:17:24,169
That's how I show my love to him!

244
00:17:24,194 --> 00:17:25,296
The hell are you saying?

245
00:17:25,321 --> 00:17:26,404
But what about you?

246
00:17:28,404 --> 00:17:29,550
What did you do?

247
00:17:29,575 --> 00:17:30,634
What?

248
00:17:30,659 --> 00:17:33,380
How do you show him your love?

249
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,598
By standing there,

250
00:17:35,623 --> 00:17:36,769
unable to stop me,

251
00:17:36,794 --> 00:17:37,956
unable to protect him,

252
00:17:38,584 --> 00:17:40,208
is that your way of love?

253
00:17:41,545 --> 00:17:42,885
And you still think you deserve

254
00:17:42,906 --> 00:17:44,149
to stay by his side?

255
00:17:44,173 --> 00:17:46,005
You dare to love him?

256
00:17:47,926 --> 00:17:49,178
You call that love?

257
00:17:50,304 --> 00:17:52,209
Is that love?

258
00:17:52,318 --> 00:17:53,318
You bastard!

259
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,988
You'll never ever understand why

260
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,308
I even proposed that contract.

261
00:18:00,981 --> 00:18:02,458
Asshole.

262
00:18:02,483 --> 00:18:05,014
That's why you'll always be an idiot.

263
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,389
Let go! Let go of me!

264
00:18:07,414 --> 00:18:08,670
Let go!

265
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:18,891
(Thank you)

266
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,361
Albi Construction.

267
00:18:21,251 --> 00:18:22,826
Has Albi Construction not arrived?

268
00:18:23,796 --> 00:18:24,894
Then we'll proceed with

269
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:26,375
the next presenter, Yongri Construction.

270
00:18:26,414 --> 00:18:28,006
(Presenting the bidding for the
construction project of Dubai Resort 2024)

271
00:18:30,886 --> 00:18:32,487
I'm here.

272
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:48,793
I told you.

273
00:18:49,947 --> 00:18:51,895
Because of you, I learned to dream too.

274
00:18:54,284 --> 00:18:56,799
So don't give up.

275
00:18:58,372 --> 00:18:59,799
Do it for me.

276
00:19:01,655 --> 00:19:03,204
Give it your all until the end.

277
00:19:34,992 --> 00:19:37,244
Think of it as my

278
00:19:38,162 --> 00:19:39,513
last request.

279
00:19:46,795 --> 00:19:48,037
Hello.

280
00:19:49,298 --> 00:19:50,426
I am Jung Daon from the

281
00:19:50,454 --> 00:19:51,596
Strategic Planning Department

282
00:19:51,626 --> 00:19:53,123
at Albi Construction.

283
00:20:12,863 --> 00:20:14,031
This is the presentation file.

284
00:20:17,701 --> 00:20:18,828
I was going to swap this

285
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,148
and ruin the presentation,

286
00:20:20,871 --> 00:20:22,155
so you wouldn't be able to go

287
00:20:22,168 --> 00:20:23,248
to the overseas branch.

288
00:20:31,507 --> 00:20:32,678
But?

289
00:20:35,928 --> 00:20:38,132
I got tired of being an idiot.

290
00:20:38,868 --> 00:20:40,155
Even though it's too late.

291
00:20:42,434 --> 00:20:43,450
Even when you were

292
00:20:43,477 --> 00:20:44,516
on the brink of death,

293
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:45,867
I just stood there like a fool.

294
00:20:48,524 --> 00:20:50,234
What right do I have to be by your side?

295
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:54,851
Like you said, too much time

296
00:20:54,876 --> 00:20:56,556
has passed to go back.

297
00:20:59,618 --> 00:21:02,070
Or maybe time was never the issue.

298
00:21:07,918 --> 00:21:08,988
I'm sorry for leaving

299
00:21:09,013 --> 00:21:10,173
and making you lonely.

300
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:13,215
For leaving you behind.

301
00:21:15,175 --> 00:21:16,635
For not being honest.

302
00:21:19,096 --> 00:21:20,565
For being a coward.

303
00:21:22,683 --> 00:21:23,725
I'm sorry.

304
00:21:28,188 --> 00:21:30,096
I know it's too late now,

305
00:21:31,733 --> 00:21:32,786
but I really wanted to

306
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:33,819
say this one last time.

307
00:21:38,198 --> 00:21:39,331
Go now.

308
00:22:34,993 --> 00:22:36,643
(Yeji Hospital, several days later)

309
00:22:54,316 --> 00:22:55,581
Ju Seonghyeon.

310
00:23:07,162 --> 00:23:08,580
Did your presentation go well?

311
00:23:09,873 --> 00:23:11,169
I like you.

312
00:23:14,628 --> 00:23:15,964
I like you a lot.

313
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,384
I was very terrified

314
00:23:22,928 --> 00:23:24,370
that I'd never get to say this.

315
00:24:08,765 --> 00:24:09,933
I like you too.

316
00:24:11,893 --> 00:24:13,205
A whole lot.

317
00:24:29,617 --> 00:24:30,663
Ah.

318
00:24:34,207 --> 00:24:35,281
Huh?

319
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,554
What?

320
00:24:37,044 --> 00:24:38,234
Is something wrong?

321
00:24:39,963 --> 00:24:41,690
Since Assistant Manager Jung fed me,

322
00:24:41,715 --> 00:24:43,291
it tastes way better.

323
00:24:44,956 --> 00:24:46,634
Didn't you say Room 502?

324
00:24:46,845 --> 00:24:48,555
It says here, patient Ju Seonghyeon.

325
00:24:55,353 --> 00:24:56,751
Assistant Manager!

326
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,148
Are you feeling better?

327
00:24:58,148 --> 00:24:59,941
We were all so worried.

328
00:24:59,941 --> 00:25:02,265
Ah, as you can see, I'm perfectly fine.

329
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:04,243
Then should we call

330
00:25:04,263 --> 00:25:05,757
Assistant Manager Jung too?

331
00:25:05,781 --> 00:25:07,109
Why?

332
00:25:08,116 --> 00:25:10,756
I mean, if we're all visiting,

333
00:25:10,781 --> 00:25:12,714
it'd be nice if he came too…

334
00:25:12,954 --> 00:25:14,858
It's the weekend, he must be busy.

335
00:25:15,082 --> 00:25:17,316
I'm fine with just you guys.

336
00:25:17,709 --> 00:25:19,412
By the way, why is it so puffy here?

337
00:25:19,544 --> 00:25:21,505
Are you hiding something?

338
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,122
No?

339
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,395
Don't!

340
00:25:26,134 --> 00:25:27,152
Ah, sorry.

341
00:25:27,177 --> 00:25:28,255
That must've hurt.

342
00:25:28,595 --> 00:25:29,786
Sorry.

343
00:25:30,263 --> 00:25:31,283
Why don't you all go

344
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,353
get something to drink?

345
00:25:32,377 --> 00:25:33,492
My treat!

346
00:25:33,517 --> 00:25:35,202
Should you be getting up?

347
00:25:35,227 --> 00:25:36,415
Ah, the surgery went well,

348
00:25:36,449 --> 00:25:37,969
I'm fine, I'm fine.

349
00:25:38,005 --> 00:25:39,256
Go ahead. I'll take my meds

350
00:25:39,281 --> 00:25:40,321
and join you.

351
00:25:40,524 --> 00:25:42,146
Hurry, hurry!

352
00:25:42,171 --> 00:25:44,628
- Quickly!
- Okay, we're going, calm down.

353
00:25:44,653 --> 00:25:46,030
Follow us soon.

354
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,960
I feel guilty.

355
00:26:01,086 --> 00:26:02,264
I think we're going to win

356
00:26:02,289 --> 00:26:03,515
the resort construction bid.

357
00:26:03,547 --> 00:26:04,914
That's a relief.

358
00:26:05,006 --> 00:26:06,591
Assistant Manager Ju, good work.

359
00:26:06,806 --> 00:26:08,092
I didn't do anything.

360
00:26:08,844 --> 00:26:10,297
Oh, then Assistant Manager Jung

361
00:26:10,323 --> 00:26:11,323
will be going to

362
00:26:11,324 --> 00:26:12,532
the overseas branch soon.

363
00:26:12,556 --> 00:26:14,076
- Oh, right.
- Most likely.

364
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,078
And we got close.

365
00:26:18,103 --> 00:26:19,146
Won't see you for a long time.

366
00:26:19,146 --> 00:26:20,188
You were really good at your job.

367
00:26:21,314 --> 00:26:22,374
Assistant Manager Jung.

368
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:23,645
Your overseas branch assignment

369
00:26:23,672 --> 00:26:24,737
will likely come soon,

370
00:26:24,762 --> 00:26:26,051
so start preparing.

371
00:26:33,702 --> 00:26:34,850
I'm still thinking about

372
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:36,094
the overseas branch...

373
00:26:42,836 --> 00:26:44,390
Did everyone leave?

374
00:26:45,005 --> 00:26:46,512
You must be tired. Get some rest.

375
00:26:53,471 --> 00:26:54,723
You don't handle heat well, right?

376
00:26:55,056 --> 00:26:57,016
I heard Dubai is really hot.

377
00:26:59,144 --> 00:27:00,312
If you're going to the
overseas branch soon...

378
00:27:00,312 --> 00:27:01,413
Overseas branch...

379
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,481
I'm not going.

380
00:27:05,233 --> 00:27:06,443
Not going?

381
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,700
Thinking about it...

382
00:27:11,448 --> 00:27:14,026
How can I stay there for a year?

383
00:27:14,576 --> 00:27:15,952
I don't think I really wanted
to go that much...

384
00:27:15,952 --> 00:27:17,370
But it's a great opportunity for you.

385
00:27:18,121 --> 00:27:19,449
Of course, you should go.

386
00:27:20,165 --> 00:27:22,464
I'm really good at waiting.

387
00:27:22,626 --> 00:27:23,939
When I was a kid, I never cried

388
00:27:23,973 --> 00:27:25,099
while waiting for my grandma

389
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:25,967
to finish work,

390
00:27:25,992 --> 00:27:27,189
so people called me a filial grandson.

391
00:27:27,214 --> 00:27:28,745
In college, even if the shuttle bus

392
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:30,011
was five hours away,

393
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,431
I waited without complaining,

394
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:33,125
so my nickname was "Ju-Waiting."

395
00:27:33,178 --> 00:27:35,263
I have persistence and patience,

396
00:27:35,972 --> 00:27:37,091
so I can wait, no matter

397
00:27:37,116 --> 00:27:38,256
how many years it takes.

398
00:27:39,351 --> 00:27:41,515
So if you're staying because of me,

399
00:27:42,562 --> 00:27:44,405
don't worry and just go.

400
00:27:45,023 --> 00:27:47,421
I am sure that I won't look at anyone.

401
00:27:50,278 --> 00:27:51,653
Thank you.

402
00:27:53,823 --> 00:27:55,033
I won't make you wait long.

403
00:27:56,076 --> 00:27:57,199
Just one year.

404
00:27:57,285 --> 00:27:58,309
One year? I can wait

405
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,597
a hundred years if I have to.

406
00:27:59,621 --> 00:28:01,122
Ah, wait, no, not a hundred.

407
00:28:01,149 --> 00:28:02,429
I take it back.

408
00:28:06,878 --> 00:28:08,088
Instead...

409
00:28:09,172 --> 00:28:10,219
Before you leave, go on

410
00:28:10,239 --> 00:28:11,372
a date with me every day.

411
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,765
There's so much I want to do with you.

412
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:43,828
Two, three.

413
00:28:45,532 --> 00:28:47,101
Two, three.

414
00:29:54,736 --> 00:29:56,111
Take care and have a safe trip.

415
00:29:56,241 --> 00:29:58,799
Never eat food from strangers.

416
00:29:59,032 --> 00:30:00,072
It's dangerous to be

417
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:01,302
out too late at night,

418
00:30:01,326 --> 00:30:02,494
so don't go out alone.

419
00:30:03,823 --> 00:30:04,888
And also...

420
00:30:04,913 --> 00:30:06,248
I got it.

421
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,093
And...

422
00:30:11,961 --> 00:30:13,343
If anyone tries to hit on you,

423
00:30:13,671 --> 00:30:15,053
show them the ring first.

424
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:17,681
Ring?

425
00:30:19,427 --> 00:30:20,689
What ring?

426
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,652
You can't run away now.

427
00:30:53,586 --> 00:30:54,963
I never planned to.

428
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:57,128
Never.

429
00:30:57,674 --> 00:30:59,057
I'll be waiting.

430
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:00,767
Take your time.

431
00:31:19,113 --> 00:31:21,267
(One year later)

432
00:31:35,086 --> 00:31:36,938
Assistant Manager Ju. I'm so sorry.

433
00:31:36,963 --> 00:31:37,983
I think I sent you

434
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:39,150
the wrong file yesterday.

435
00:31:39,174 --> 00:31:40,550
You must have already made the proposal.

436
00:31:40,575 --> 00:31:41,892
I'm really sorry.

437
00:31:44,181 --> 00:31:45,572
It's okay.

438
00:31:45,597 --> 00:31:46,656
Take your time,

439
00:31:46,681 --> 00:31:47,930
just submit it by tomorrow.

440
00:31:50,477 --> 00:31:51,862
Okay, then. I'll finish it quickly

441
00:31:51,887 --> 00:31:53,136
and send it over.

442
00:31:53,188 --> 00:31:54,336
Alright.

443
00:31:55,273 --> 00:31:57,836
Here, everyone, take one.

444
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,944
Thank you.

445
00:31:59,969 --> 00:32:01,596
Here, here.

446
00:32:03,448 --> 00:32:04,799
Choco, choco latte...

447
00:32:04,824 --> 00:32:06,443
Uh, it looks like there's none

448
00:32:06,468 --> 00:32:08,722
for Assistant Manager Ju...

449
00:32:08,892 --> 00:32:09,893
Oh, I think

450
00:32:10,371 --> 00:32:11,539
I forgot to bring it.

451
00:32:12,081 --> 00:32:13,628
You can have mine.

452
00:32:15,001 --> 00:32:16,352
It's okay.

453
00:32:16,628 --> 00:32:17,854
I can just drink water.

454
00:32:17,879 --> 00:32:19,251
No problem at all.

455
00:32:22,513 --> 00:32:23,568
Assistant Manager Ju.

456
00:32:23,593 --> 00:32:24,844
He's a bit strange today.

457
00:32:25,011 --> 00:32:26,154
Like...

458
00:32:26,179 --> 00:32:27,972
Unusually upbeat?

459
00:32:28,389 --> 00:32:29,657
Yeah.

460
00:32:29,682 --> 00:32:31,104
Did something good happen?

461
00:32:32,268 --> 00:32:33,689
Thank you.

462
00:32:37,065 --> 00:32:38,541
Has the plane taken off yet?

463
00:32:38,566 --> 00:32:39,567
Something came up,

464
00:32:39,567 --> 00:32:40,835
I don't think I can leave today.

465
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:41,920
What?

466
00:32:41,945 --> 00:32:42,990
I think I'll only be able

467
00:32:42,998 --> 00:32:44,256
to leave in about a week.

468
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,733
I'm sorry.

469
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,311
It's okay.

470
00:32:58,336 --> 00:32:59,663
Take care of your work, no rush.

471
00:33:17,348 --> 00:33:18,741
Hello?

472
00:33:18,773 --> 00:33:20,472
Are you getting off work okay?

473
00:33:21,651 --> 00:33:23,776
Yeah, I'm in front of the office now.

474
00:33:24,654 --> 00:33:25,714
Sorry.

475
00:33:26,197 --> 00:33:27,287
You must have really been

476
00:33:27,307 --> 00:33:28,374
looking forward to it.

477
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:30,260
It can't be helped.

478
00:33:30,285 --> 00:33:31,559
It's okay.

479
00:33:32,245 --> 00:33:33,784
I waited a whole year.

480
00:33:34,184 --> 00:33:35,566
A week is nothing.

481
00:33:36,541 --> 00:33:38,236
Are you really okay?

482
00:33:38,793 --> 00:33:40,159
You're not walking all slumped over,

483
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:41,020
are you?

484
00:33:41,045 --> 00:33:42,397
I'm not.

485
00:33:42,422 --> 00:33:43,724
You totally are.

486
00:33:44,274 --> 00:33:45,599
You're wearing a white knit sweater

487
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:46,734
and walking all slouched, aren't you?

488
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:48,328
You're in gray pants,

489
00:33:48,353 --> 00:33:49,486
with black penny loafers,

490
00:33:49,506 --> 00:33:50,476
just dragging your feet.

491
00:33:50,501 --> 00:33:52,181
Wow, how did you know?

492
00:33:52,383 --> 00:33:54,045
Are you watching me or something?

493
00:33:54,618 --> 00:33:56,356
If you're curious, look in front of you.

494
00:34:06,446 --> 00:34:07,946
There was a time when I thought

495
00:34:08,197 --> 00:34:09,819
love was only for people

496
00:34:09,844 --> 00:34:11,284
of the same level.

497
00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:14,673
Even if it meant lying,

498
00:34:15,419 --> 00:34:17,338
even if it meant keeping secrets,

499
00:34:19,917 --> 00:34:21,190
even if it meant getting hurt

500
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:22,490
for doing that.

501
00:34:23,796 --> 00:34:25,266
There was a time I just wanted to be

502
00:34:25,291 --> 00:34:26,710
on the same level as that person.

503
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,273
A time when I just wanted to love,

504
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,560
no matter what.

505
00:34:31,888 --> 00:34:33,114
But now,

506
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,888
not anymore.

507
00:34:35,808 --> 00:34:37,310
I don't need secrets anymore.

508
00:34:38,935 --> 00:34:40,317
Because I know now that

509
00:34:41,189 --> 00:34:42,224
love isn't about levels,

510
00:34:42,244 --> 00:34:43,337
it's about the heart.

511
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,084
Thank you for waiting for me.

512
00:34:45,109 --> 00:34:47,280
As long as we have unwavering trust,

513
00:34:47,695 --> 00:34:49,864
and offering sincerity to each other...

514
00:34:50,184 --> 00:34:51,543
I don't want that word.

515
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:54,555
That's all that matters for love.

516
00:34:55,787 --> 00:34:57,146
I love you.

517
00:34:59,539 --> 00:35:00,832
I love you, too.

518
00:35:07,546 --> 00:35:08,741
Just like now.

519
00:35:39,386 --> 00:35:42,810
(Thank you for watching
Secret Relationships)

520
00:35:48,325 --> 00:35:51,162
(12 years ago)

521
00:36:14,157 --> 00:36:15,283
Are you okay?

522
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:19,309
I've called an ambulance.

523
00:36:19,334 --> 00:36:20,592
Please wait a moment.

524
00:36:28,004 --> 00:36:29,464
Thank you.
