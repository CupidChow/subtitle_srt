I'm sorry. Please leave.

184
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,830
Goodness! Goodness!

185
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:06,680
It's all my fault! I'm to blame!

186
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:12,440
I worked day and night to make money for my family

187
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:15,330
and didn't take good care of my son.

188
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,080
This is my karma!

189
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:21,100
I can't even reach my only son.

190
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,830
Goodness!

191
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,030
What are you doing?

192
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,930
Where do you think you are?

193
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:31,860
Please leave.

194
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:35,050
Da-on, I was wrong last time.

195
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,940
-This time...
-I said leave!

196
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:48,470
Da-on, please forgive me just once.

197
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,440
Da-on! Da-on! Da-on!

198
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:55,450
What the hell's going on?

199
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,390
Please, please... Please forgive me.

200
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,040
You punk.

201
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,850
Hey.

202
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,470
You ingrate.

203
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:05,160
Is this how you repay me for raising you?

204
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:08,820
If it weren't for me, do you think you'd be working in such a good company?

205
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:11,530
If it weren't for you,

206
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:13,330
I'd have been in a better place with a better life.

207
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,540
Please forgive me just once.

208
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,620
Just this once, please.

209
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,140
Just this once. I promise. Just once.

210
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,860
Then I can double the money I lost.

211
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,410
No, five times! I can win back five times the money!

212
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,670
I feel really lucky now!

213
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,820
Please stop.

214
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,050
You have money, right?

215
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,820
You have money. Give me some money.

216
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,170
Gosh, please stop!

217
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:35,100
Hey, don't do this to family!

218
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,330
You're no longer my family.

219
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,080
So don't ever come to me again.

220
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,550
If you come again, I'll call the police.

221
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,950
Hey!

222
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,760
I'm your family! You ingrate!

223
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,340
Hey, you ingrate!

224
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:01,550
How can you do this!

225
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,220
[Da-on: I'm at a cafe near my workplace. I'll probably get off work late.]

226
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,740
Cafe near his workplace?

227
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,060
Where are you now?

228
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,200
Right now?

229
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:19,430
At school.

230
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,870
Professor, aren't you going in?

231
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,070
Huh? I am.

232
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,690
-Let's go in together.
-Okay.

233
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,480
[Da-on's dad]

234
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,010
It was such a huge scene.

235
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,130
He's from Strategic Planning HQ.

236
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,490
You should've said something if you're sick.

237
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,400
Since you didn't charge for the repair, I'll repay you with this.

238
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,400
This is the benefit of having a team member!

239
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,780
[Someone caused a scene in the lobby during lunch break today.]

240
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,460
Da-on.

241
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,530
I was wrong last time.

242
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:02,520
-This time...
-I said leave!

243
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,650
He's dressed in designer, but he can't spare some money for his dad?

244
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:11,050
I thought he was nice and kind. What a shocker.

245
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,590
What's crazier is him pretending to be from a rich family.

246
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:16,510
So what if his clothes are designer? His personality is fake.

247
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,900
Was that really his dad? His dad's clothes seemed shabby.

248
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,310
He probably wears knock-offs.

249
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,180
Why didn't he just answer his dad's calls?

250
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,880
I knew something was off when he only dresses in designer.

251
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,770
If I were him, I'd have quit out of embarrassment.

252
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,020
Their team's screwed.

253
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,500
Like father, like son.

254
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,640
Wow, I thought Mr. Jung came from a rich family.

255
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,520
How could he lie like that?

256
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:49,030
But we can't really say he lied about it.

257
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:53,320
After all, he didn't say he was rich himself.

258
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,520
No, no. He knew the rumors of him being rich,

259
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,650
but he didn't deny it.

260
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,380
This means that he enjoys it.

261
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:04,410
If he's rich enough to always dress in designer,

262
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:06,040
how could he be so cold to his dad?

263
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,020
When he screamed, "I said leave!",

264
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,050
I thought he was possessed.

265
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,300
That was so scary.

266
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,480
I know.

267
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,160
Don't gossip about stuff you don't know.

268
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,660
Why didn't Mr. Jung deny the rumors?

269
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,770
Why's he on bad terms with his dad?

270
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,450
We don't know anything.

271
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,910
So don't make assumptions behind his ba—

272
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,880
Mr. Jung should explain it then.

273
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,130
To be honest, I don't think it's right for him to not say a word

274
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,380
after such a thing happened.

275
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,920
But no one approached him to ask him about it either.

276
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,990
If you're curious, ask him yourself. If not...

277
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,690
I don't think it's right to gossip about it.

278
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,460
-Right. That's right.
-Yeah, yeah.

279
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:54,000
-Shall we go?
-Yeah, yeah.

280
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,740
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have interfered.

281
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:35,740
Thank you.

282
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,260
For the medicine... and for speaking up for me.

283
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,550
I think I should express my gratitude

284
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,220
since we're in the same team.

285
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,690
I said leave!

286
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:09,590
Have dinner with me.

287
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:10,810
Sorry?

288
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,940
Can't team members have dinner together?

289
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,130
It'll be my treat.

290
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:18,930
Okay.

291
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,380
Please let go of my hand.

292
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,510
I'm sorry.

293
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,150
No, it's okay.

294
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,630
I wanted to treat you to something better.

295
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,360
Next time, I'll treat you to something really good.

296
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,610
I'll treat you next time.

297
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,290
Eat it while it's hot.

298
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,700
Then I'll dig in!

299
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,920
I didn't mean to lie.

300
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,700
I didn't start or spread the rumor.

301
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,130
-So I didn't think it was necessary to explain—
-I know.

302
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,350
No matter what others say or think,

303
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,820
don't worry about it.

304
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,220
As long as your conscience is clear.

305
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,450
What do you usually do on weekends?

306
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,330
Cleaning and researching stocks.

307
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:46,830
Nothing special.

308
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,330
Mr. Ju, what do you do on weekends?

309
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,740
I work out

310
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,130
or watch movies.

311
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,150
Do you like movies?

312
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:55,510
Yes.

313
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,470
But I only watch horror movies.

314
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,980
Oh? I like horror movies too.

315
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,630
Have you watched the movie "Between Ghosts"?

316
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,140
No.

317
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,960
It's not available online yet.

318
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,920
Actually, I can't watch them in the cinema.

319
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:14,900
Maybe it's because the sound is too loud

320
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,060
that it's scary to watch it alone.

321
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,270
Scared because the sound is too loud?

322
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,370
-Daseul, I'm busy—
-What do I do?

323
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,490
I think Dad called to ask for money

324
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,510
from Jaemin.

325
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,360
What?

326
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,400
Got it. I'll talk to him.

327
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:23,580
I'm sorry.

328
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,830
Something cropped up at home. I have to go.

329
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,990
I'll treat you to a proper meal next time.

330
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,620
Forget dinner.

331
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,330
Treat me to a movie.

332
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,020
Let's watch a horror movie this weekend.

333
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:44,990
I think I can watch it if it's with you.

334
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:08,810
Hello.

335
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:10,860
Why're you out of breath?

336
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:12,920
Do you want something to drink?

337
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,470
Why did you help him?

338
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:20,790
Why'd you...

339
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:23,860
give my dad money?

340
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,920
Oh... So you heard it from Daseul?

341
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,740
My sister's living expenses too.

342
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:32,630
And this time, my dad, too.

343
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,080
You know that

344
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,960
my dad gambles away all the money he gets.

345
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,350
But why...

346
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,270
Well...

347
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,270
I'm helping because I can afford to.

348
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,620
Don't feel too burdened.

349
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,390
But if that's the case,

350
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,870
I'm always just receiving help from you.

351
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:55,730
Da-on.

352
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,780
It's okay to just receive help.

353
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,610
-Because it's from me—
-I don't like it.

354
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,470
I don't want our relationship

355
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:09,770
to be like this again.

356
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,540
I'm sorry.

357
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,170
I wasn't considerate enough.

358
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,450
I thought doing all this

359
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,760
would be helping you.

360
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:40,850
I'm not being like this to hear an apology from you.

361
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,180
No.

362
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,460
You're right. I was too rash.

363
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,270
I'm sorry.

364
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,740
What'd you like me to do from now on?

365
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,370
I'll take care of my parents myself.

366
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,920
So...

367
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,940
if my parents contact you, just ignore them.

368
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,630
Okay, I will.

369
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:18,250
-Actually, yesterday...
-Actually, yesterday...

370
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:21,000
Soohyun came looking for me.

371
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:26,270
He asked to get back together.

372
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,550
I was scared.

373
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:33,640
You know too...

374
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,420
what kind of person he is.

375
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:45,520
Stop it.

376
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:46,710
Please stop.

377
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,410
Let go. I said let go!

378
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,940
He wants to get back with you?

379
00:25:58,730 --> 00:25:59,720
Yes.

380
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,330
What should I do?

381
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,120
Should I reject him?

382
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:22,370
Okay, I'll reject him.

383
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,490
Did he... by any chance contact you?

384
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,070
No.

385
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,790
That's a relief.

386
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:51,090
Stay with me today.

387
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,500
Stay with me,

388
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,980
okay?

389
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,790
I know I shouldn't, but I keep...

390
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:30,240
coveting the spot beside you.

391
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:46,830
Am I... allowed to now?

392
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,000
Maybe Jaemin also...

393
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,650
likes me too?

394
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,800
I want you to be mine... for once.

395
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,910
Jaemin, I like you.

396
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,080
I've liked you from the beginning.

397
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,690
Why do you keep crossing the line?

398
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:08,510
You're perceptive and considerate.

399
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:11,280
Why are you doing something so stupid?

400
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,820
Tell me.

401
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,940
No... I...

402
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,340
Leave after breakfast.

403
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:48,040
Has Jaemin never liked me? Or is it...

404
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,200
because Kim Soohyun is back?

405
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,860
If he's swayed by Kim Soohyun...

406
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,450
Your fever has gone down.

407
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,540
Don't over-exhaust yourself for the time being.

408
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:16,280
Lie down a little longer. You had a fever of 40 degrees.

409
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:20,390
I'm okay. I have to go to work.

410
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,620
I've informed the manager.

411
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,760
You don't have to go in to work today.

412
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,640
I'm really fine.

413
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,160
Just now...

414
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,740
Did something happen?

415
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:43,640
You just stayed in the rain.

416
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,260
Nothing happened.

417
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,300
I've dried your sweater.

418
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,600
Your jacket's at the drycleaners.

419
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,480
It'll take some time.

420
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,470
Thank you.

421
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,320
This is the material you asked for.

422
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:23,710
Thank you.

423
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,210
Let's go to the meeting.

424
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:45,610
Okay.

425
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,000
Are you really okay?

426
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,770
You still look a bit pale.

427
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,710
How about I buy you some congee on the way back?

428
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,870
I'm really fine.

429
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,220
Sometimes...

430
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:13,570
when I'm really struggling or can't talk about my troubles,

431
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,450
I'd just cry it out.

432
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:19,080
After that, I'd feel

433
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,270
a bit better.

434
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,270
Sorry?

435
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:27,270
I'm just saying. That's what I do.

436
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:35,220
Oh, right. Your jacket!

437
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,340
I'll go get it.

438
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,060
I'll go—

439
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:00,570
Stop contacting me.

440
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,570
Stop contacting you?

441
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:16,420
Soohyun, why are you here?

442
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,760
Did you sleep at Shin Jaemin's place last night?

443
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:19,510
Shin Jaemin?

444
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,949
[7 years ago]

445
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,610
Jung Da-on!

446
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,770
Hey! Let go of me first.

447
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:34,730
I don't want to.

448
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:38,659
What? Did I hurt you?

449
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,460
I was very gentle.

450
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:43,600
I was faking it.

451
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:47,429
Did you eat?

452
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:48,710
I bet you just had triangular kimbap again.

453
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,409
I have to work part-time after tutoring.

454
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:52,770
I'll give you a ride. Eat first.

455
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:54,679
It's okay. I don't have time.

456
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,380
Eat before you go.
