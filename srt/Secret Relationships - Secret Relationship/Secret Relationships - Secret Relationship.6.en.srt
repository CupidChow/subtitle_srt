1
00:00:00,368 --> 00:00:01,656
What did you just say, you punk?

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,680
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:06,374
Hyung, stop.
Just stop and go inside.

4
00:00:06,405 --> 00:00:07,585
Go inside?

5
00:00:08,001 --> 00:00:09,044
Go inside your room?

6
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:10,426
Hurry.

7
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:13,810
Hey, what do I do?

8
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,973
He's asking me to go in with him.

9
00:00:20,805 --> 00:00:22,211
Don't go.

10
00:00:24,893 --> 00:00:26,289
Please, don't go, Daon.

11
00:00:33,526 --> 00:00:34,924
Please.

12
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:14,690
From now on,

13
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,700
don't ever look at that bastard with

14
00:01:17,725 --> 00:01:19,034
those eyes in front of me again.

15
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,376
What if I said no?

16
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,495
I'll kill him.

17
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:26,506
I'll kill that bastard,

18
00:01:26,531 --> 00:01:27,546
Ju Seonghyeon, first.

19
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,164
If you understand,

20
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:34,855
behave yourself from now on.

21
00:01:41,586 --> 00:01:45,714
"Secret Relationships"

22
00:01:47,561 --> 00:01:50,167
(Episode 6)

23
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:34,914
Are you okay?

24
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:36,583
Did you get hurt anywhere?

25
00:02:36,608 --> 00:02:38,376
It's none of your business.

26
00:02:38,401 --> 00:02:39,581
I was so worried, I couldn't

27
00:02:39,608 --> 00:02:40,755
do anything all night.

28
00:02:40,779 --> 00:02:42,036
Worried?

29
00:02:42,947 --> 00:02:44,513
Why do you have to worry about me?

30
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,242
Why? It's because…

31
00:02:46,242 --> 00:02:47,983
After seeing what happened yesterday,
you're saying this?

32
00:02:48,014 --> 00:02:49,682
This is the real me.

33
00:02:49,717 --> 00:02:51,145
I'm all sweet with you,

34
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,309
if someone else shows up,

35
00:02:52,323 --> 00:02:54,116
I can throw you away in an instant.

36
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:55,877
Every time something like this happens,

37
00:02:55,877 --> 00:02:56,878
I'll let go of your hand...

38
00:02:56,878 --> 00:02:58,338
I don't care.

39
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,964
I can wait.

40
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,844
How long do you think you can wait?

41
00:03:05,929 --> 00:03:07,489
A month?

42
00:03:07,514 --> 00:03:08,960
A year?

43
00:03:10,892 --> 00:03:12,220
No.

44
00:03:12,936 --> 00:03:14,524
You won't last even a few days.

45
00:03:16,356 --> 00:03:17,456
Just like everyone else,

46
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:18,856
you'll give up soon enough.

47
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,311
You will be disappointed in me.

48
00:03:26,074 --> 00:03:27,076
Don't be afraid of

49
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,142
losing your dignity now.

50
00:03:29,869 --> 00:03:31,392
Just leave when I tell you to.

51
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,689
I'll never give up.

52
00:03:38,461 --> 00:03:39,527
So don't even think about

53
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:40,567
pushing me away.

54
00:04:03,027 --> 00:04:04,578
The door is opening.

55
00:04:08,502 --> 00:04:12,453
(Albi Construction)

56
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:18,713
Looks like you didn't

57
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,744
get a wink of sleep.

58
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:22,188
Your face is a mess.

59
00:04:22,213 --> 00:04:23,594
We're not so close that we ask each

60
00:04:23,619 --> 00:04:25,126
other about each other's well-being.

61
00:04:25,151 --> 00:04:26,744
Sorry.

62
00:04:26,796 --> 00:04:27,821
It's just that yesterday,

63
00:04:27,846 --> 00:04:28,913
you didn't know your place

64
00:04:28,938 --> 00:04:29,869
and crossed the line.

65
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:30,938
So I thought maybe we

66
00:04:30,952 --> 00:04:32,165
got close enough to ask.

67
00:04:33,933 --> 00:04:35,065
The one who crossed the line

68
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,512
wasn't me, it was you, Director.

69
00:04:38,104 --> 00:04:39,433
Want me to show you what crossing

70
00:04:39,447 --> 00:04:40,560
the line really looks like?

71
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:45,030
Are you planning to show that habit of

72
00:04:45,043 --> 00:04:46,516
grabbing collars in the office, too?

73
00:04:47,947 --> 00:04:49,131
Seeing you react like this,

74
00:04:49,145 --> 00:04:51,012
you must be really anxious.

75
00:04:51,451 --> 00:04:53,136
Anxious?

76
00:04:53,161 --> 00:04:54,625
Isn't that something only people who

77
00:04:54,646 --> 00:04:55,890
have never possessed something feel?

78
00:04:55,914 --> 00:04:57,334
Anyway, the person who has been with

79
00:04:57,359 --> 00:04:58,225
him longer is me, not you.

80
00:04:58,249 --> 00:04:59,451
Exactly.

81
00:05:01,294 --> 00:05:03,087
It just looks like you're Anxious.

82
00:05:10,726 --> 00:05:12,295
Bastard.

83
00:05:20,364 --> 00:05:22,111
Since the site is close to the sea,

84
00:05:22,136 --> 00:05:23,775
we should select wood

85
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,548
it's durable and not easily corroded.

86
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,665
- What do you think?
- Leave work with me later.

87
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:39,602
I made a list of suppliers handling

88
00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:40,909
teak and cedar,

89
00:05:41,084 --> 00:05:42,106
and many are available

90
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,246
for meetings next week...

91
00:05:47,757 --> 00:05:49,592
I said, let's leave together.

92
00:05:51,803 --> 00:05:53,221
We're in a meeting.

93
00:05:53,705 --> 00:05:55,017
Let's talk later.

94
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,002
Well, everything sounds good.

95
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,030
Let's schedule another meeting

96
00:06:07,055 --> 00:06:08,650
after the supplier meetings.

97
00:06:10,446 --> 00:06:12,198
That's all for today then.

98
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,064
Get in.

99
00:07:50,171 --> 00:07:51,389
Go.

100
00:07:57,887 --> 00:07:59,366
Stop it already.

101
00:08:00,056 --> 00:08:01,491
You saw it.

102
00:08:01,516 --> 00:08:02,736
There's nothing between me

103
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:03,949
and Assistant Manager Ju.

104
00:08:04,602 --> 00:08:05,673
You make that face and

105
00:08:05,698 --> 00:08:06,864
expect me to believe that?

106
00:08:07,605 --> 00:08:09,085
What exactly is the problem?

107
00:08:09,273 --> 00:08:10,379
I don't even hang out with

108
00:08:10,386 --> 00:08:11,543
Jaemin hyung anymore.

109
00:08:11,568 --> 00:08:12,961
Why are you still acting like this?

110
00:08:13,945 --> 00:08:15,021
Why bring up Shin Jaemin

111
00:08:15,046 --> 00:08:16,005
all of a sudden?

112
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,216
You've been messing with me

113
00:08:17,237 --> 00:08:18,174
all this time

114
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:19,395
because of Jaemin hyung, right?

115
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,094
It's not because of Shin Jaemin.

116
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:22,504
Then what is it?

117
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,762
Because I want to be by your side.

118
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:30,796
Like before.

119
00:08:32,463 --> 00:08:34,023
Don't lie to me.

120
00:08:34,048 --> 00:08:35,566
You just want to torment with me.

121
00:08:35,594 --> 00:08:38,027
- That's not it.
- Be by my side?

122
00:08:38,052 --> 00:08:39,695
Who do you think you are?

123
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,597
When I needed you, you were never there.

124
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:43,850
So why are you coming to me now?

125
00:08:46,644 --> 00:08:48,198
I don't need you anymore.

126
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:50,933
Ever since you left seven years ago,

127
00:08:51,357 --> 00:08:52,976
I erased you from my life.

128
00:08:56,777 --> 00:08:58,364
So if you think you can just come back,

129
00:08:58,389 --> 00:08:59,389
stop dreaming.

130
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:01,088
I'll never take you back.

131
00:09:18,532 --> 00:09:19,532
Assistant Manager!

132
00:09:19,552 --> 00:09:20,998
A last-minute meeting came up,

133
00:09:21,005 --> 00:09:22,447
so I can't make it today.

134
00:09:22,471 --> 00:09:24,307
I asked someone else to cover for me.

135
00:09:24,307 --> 00:09:25,391
I'm really sorry.

136
00:09:35,735 --> 00:09:37,078
Shall we go in?

137
00:09:44,055 --> 00:09:46,329
Oh, that is okay too.

138
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:48,091
The wood is good, right?

139
00:09:48,443 --> 00:09:49,874
The quality is great,

140
00:09:49,874 --> 00:09:52,210
but the company wants a darker color.

141
00:09:53,252 --> 00:09:54,520
Excuse me for a moment.

142
00:09:54,551 --> 00:09:55,883
Sure.

143
00:10:01,427 --> 00:10:02,678
Let's have dinner later.

144
00:10:05,361 --> 00:10:06,790
Or watch a movie?

145
00:10:07,099 --> 00:10:08,993
A new horror film just came out.

146
00:10:09,018 --> 00:10:10,394
What are you doing?

147
00:10:10,419 --> 00:10:11,925
Ah, if you don't like that, we could

148
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,332
check out an exhibit this weekend...

149
00:10:14,357 --> 00:10:15,399
Assistant Manager Ju.

150
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:19,659
You said you'd let me stay by your side.

151
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,742
If it's too hard, just give up now.

152
00:10:26,953 --> 00:10:28,304
If found it.

153
00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:29,554
Follow me.

154
00:10:47,596 --> 00:10:48,641
Happy birthday.

155
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,139
I wanted to have dinner with you,

156
00:10:50,173 --> 00:10:51,259
but I don't have time.

157
00:10:51,787 --> 00:10:52,787
It's okay.

158
00:10:52,812 --> 00:10:54,530
I'm already partying with my friends.

159
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,230
Table 8, please.

160
00:11:12,498 --> 00:11:13,541
Enjoy your meal.

161
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:16,120
Damn it.

162
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,088
It splattered everywhere.

163
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:21,069
Oh no. I'm sorry.

164
00:11:21,507 --> 00:11:23,014
Sorry?

165
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:25,999
Then you shouldn't have done something

166
00:11:26,024 --> 00:11:28,093
to be sorry for in the first place.

167
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:29,682
No, that's not...

168
00:11:29,682 --> 00:11:30,764
What?

169
00:11:31,434 --> 00:11:32,764
Huh?

170
00:11:32,852 --> 00:11:34,030
Huh?

171
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:35,121
What?

172
00:11:35,146 --> 00:11:36,272
What do you mean? Speak up.

173
00:11:43,571 --> 00:11:44,969
- See you tomorrow.
- Yes.

174
00:11:45,713 --> 00:11:46,963
Thank you very much.

175
00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:51,596
- Tomorrow...
- Tomorrow, I'll come alone.

176
00:11:51,871 --> 00:11:52,924
This isn't your job,

177
00:11:52,931 --> 00:11:53,964
Assistant Manager Ju.

178
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,106
Hello.

179
00:12:03,674 --> 00:12:04,787
Yes.

180
00:12:05,301 --> 00:12:06,841
She's my sister.

181
00:12:09,055 --> 00:12:10,326
Dasul?

182
00:12:22,432 --> 00:12:24,112
Give it to me. I'll drive.

183
00:12:24,137 --> 00:12:25,606
No. I have to hurry.

184
00:12:26,739 --> 00:12:27,763
If you drive now,

185
00:12:27,777 --> 00:12:28,943
you'll get into an accident.

186
00:12:40,482 --> 00:12:42,472
(Emergency Room Open 24 hours)

187
00:12:44,344 --> 00:12:45,383
The guardian?

188
00:12:45,383 --> 00:12:46,664
We've contacted the patient's

189
00:12:46,671 --> 00:12:48,297
older brother, and he'll be here soon.

190
00:13:11,742 --> 00:13:13,163
You're here?

191
00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:16,788
How did you know to come here?

192
00:13:17,706 --> 00:13:19,109
Dasul is okay.

193
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,513
She just got a minor injury

194
00:13:20,538 --> 00:13:21,658
while working part-time.

195
00:13:21,711 --> 00:13:23,104
Part-time?

196
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,373
Brother.

197
00:13:26,718 --> 00:13:28,786
How did you get here so fast?

198
00:13:28,811 --> 00:13:30,861
- I'm fine...
- Are you asking for a scolding?

199
00:13:30,886 --> 00:13:32,077
Huh?

200
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:33,905
I told you not to get a part-time job.

201
00:13:34,557 --> 00:13:36,486
Why don't you ever listen?

202
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:40,621
How many times do I have to say it?

203
00:13:40,646 --> 00:13:42,440
This isn't the time for a job,
you should be studying...

204
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,474
Studying isn't the most

205
00:13:43,488 --> 00:13:44,584
important thing right now.

206
00:13:44,608 --> 00:13:46,836
- I need to be independent first...
- You can move out later...

207
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:49,270
Then why did you leave home so quickly?

208
00:13:49,405 --> 00:13:50,678
Dad was addicted to gambling

209
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:51,800
and never came home.

210
00:13:51,824 --> 00:13:53,062
Mom was always lying down,

211
00:13:53,069 --> 00:13:54,136
saying she was sick.

212
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,661
The twins were always looking to you.

213
00:13:55,661 --> 00:13:57,446
You don't want to live
with those annoyances.

214
00:13:57,484 --> 00:13:58,777
You dislike those things.

215
00:13:59,665 --> 00:14:00,733
As soon as you got a job,

216
00:14:00,766 --> 00:14:02,041
you left us behind and moved out.

217
00:14:02,066 --> 00:14:03,376
- Didn't you?
- Jung Dasul!

218
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,141
If you're going to keep

219
00:14:09,155 --> 00:14:10,188
acting like this,

220
00:14:11,903 --> 00:14:13,738
then just live however you want.

221
00:14:34,992 --> 00:14:36,327
Daon.

222
00:14:37,787 --> 00:14:39,890
Calm down and listen to me first.

223
00:14:41,373 --> 00:14:42,990
Dasul had her reasons too.

224
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,085
Pushing her too hard won't do any good.

225
00:14:46,521 --> 00:14:47,539
Dasul's matter...

226
00:14:47,564 --> 00:14:48,732
I'll talk to her properly.

227
00:14:49,548 --> 00:14:50,618
No.

228
00:14:51,939 --> 00:14:53,649
You don't have to worry about it.

229
00:14:55,846 --> 00:14:56,906
What?

230
00:14:56,931 --> 00:14:58,775
I said you don't have to worry about it.

231
00:15:02,353 --> 00:15:03,381
This is my problem,

232
00:15:03,406 --> 00:15:04,425
so I'll handle it myself.

233
00:15:09,318 --> 00:15:10,794
I'll be going first.

234
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,564
Be by my side?

235
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:32,550
When I needed you, you were never there.

236
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,593
So why are you coming to me now?

237
00:15:34,593 --> 00:15:35,913
So if you think you can just come back,

238
00:15:35,933 --> 00:15:36,613
stop dreaming.

239
00:15:36,637 --> 00:15:37,935
I'll never take you back.

240
00:15:51,866 --> 00:15:53,032
What the hell did you say

241
00:15:53,057 --> 00:15:54,410
to Hwasun Group's daughter?

242
00:15:54,572 --> 00:15:55,609
Why have all the

243
00:15:55,634 --> 00:15:57,327
matchmaking prospects disappeared?

244
00:15:58,325 --> 00:15:59,885
Did I ask too much from you?

245
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:00,990
Just go on the blind dates,

246
00:16:01,017 --> 00:16:02,556
meet someone decent, get married,

247
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,790
and take over Dad's company!

248
00:16:04,999 --> 00:16:07,045
Why do you always go astray?

249
00:16:07,337 --> 00:16:08,555
I don't need the company

250
00:16:08,575 --> 00:16:09,648
or anything else.

251
00:16:11,547 --> 00:16:12,647
I didn't go back to Korea

252
00:16:12,661 --> 00:16:13,920
because I wanted a company.

253
00:16:14,091 --> 00:16:15,276
What?

254
00:16:15,301 --> 00:16:17,042
You're not taking over the company?

255
00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:18,710
- What are you saying...
- You told me to study abroad

256
00:16:18,735 --> 00:16:20,281
if I wanted to protect that person.

257
00:16:20,306 --> 00:16:21,813
You said everything would be fine

258
00:16:21,827 --> 00:16:23,118
once I came back.

259
00:16:23,142 --> 00:16:24,869
So I did what you asked!

260
00:16:24,894 --> 00:16:26,829
But why? Why? Why?

261
00:16:26,854 --> 00:16:28,330
Why did it end up like this?

262
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:29,520
How long are you going to

263
00:16:29,547 --> 00:16:30,667
keep bringing up the past?

264
00:16:30,691 --> 00:16:32,097
It's already over!

265
00:16:35,446 --> 00:16:36,703
No.

266
00:16:37,072 --> 00:16:38,324
It's not over yet.

267
00:16:40,312 --> 00:16:41,733
We can start over.

268
00:16:42,828 --> 00:16:44,374
We can go back.

269
00:17:08,854 --> 00:17:10,143
I'm sorry.

270
00:17:10,648 --> 00:17:11,734
I didn't know you were

271
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:12,960
so worried about me.

272
00:17:13,901 --> 00:17:15,861
Lying and working part-time,

273
00:17:16,445 --> 00:17:18,238
saying those things earlier...

274
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:20,880
It was all my fault.

275
00:17:25,996 --> 00:17:27,183
It's cold.

276
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:29,096
Come inside quickly.

277
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,129
I'm sorry.

278
00:17:54,754 --> 00:17:56,568
I shouldn't have gotten that angry.

279
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,738
When I heard you were hurt earlier,

280
00:18:00,103 --> 00:18:02,532
- I was so shocked, my mind went blank.
- You don't have to say it. I got it.

281
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:04,353
If you're not eating,

282
00:18:04,361 --> 00:18:05,381
I'll finish it all.

283
00:18:14,378 --> 00:18:15,745
How did you hurt your arm?

284
00:18:16,338 --> 00:18:17,648
Oh,

285
00:18:17,673 --> 00:18:19,299
I slipped while serving.

286
00:18:23,554 --> 00:18:25,025
Brother, you see...

287
00:18:27,516 --> 00:18:29,017
About Jaemin...

288
00:18:29,935 --> 00:18:31,128
I think he's a bit strange.

289
00:18:31,854 --> 00:18:33,143
I never told anyone that

290
00:18:33,157 --> 00:18:34,837
I was working there.

291
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,649
Him suddenly showing up like that

292
00:18:36,674 --> 00:18:37,700
was strange.

293
00:18:37,949 --> 00:18:39,075
And the fact that

294
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,085
he appeared right after I got hurt.

295
00:18:43,532 --> 00:18:44,972
It doesn't feel like a coincidence.

296
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,471
The amount you mentioned is different.

297
00:18:51,165 --> 00:18:52,916
You should have done as instructed.

298
00:18:54,293 --> 00:18:55,853
I only told you to scare her.

299
00:18:55,878 --> 00:18:57,191
The one who caused the injury

300
00:18:57,218 --> 00:18:58,477
and made things complicated

301
00:19:00,591 --> 00:19:02,003
was you, wasn't it?

302
00:19:14,605 --> 00:19:15,817
What do you mean by that?

303
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,584
It's like...

304
00:19:18,609 --> 00:19:20,944
He had anticipated everything.

305
00:19:21,445 --> 00:19:22,629
That can't be.

306
00:19:22,654 --> 00:19:23,929
You know that too.

307
00:19:24,662 --> 00:19:26,206
You know how much he looks after us.

308
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:28,823
It's just a coincidence.

309
00:19:32,143 --> 00:19:33,091
Sorry.

310
00:19:33,099 --> 00:19:34,625
Maybe I'm just being too sensitive.

311
00:19:43,258 --> 00:19:44,259
Oh, right.

312
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,547
The person who came with you earlier...

313
00:19:50,025 --> 00:19:51,611
Never mind, it's nothing.

314
00:20:07,007 --> 00:20:08,749
I'm Daon's younger sister.

315
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:11,022
Can I see you for a moment?

316
00:20:20,712 --> 00:20:22,126
Over here.

317
00:20:32,182 --> 00:20:33,934
The guardian for patient Jung Dasul?

318
00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:36,697
My guardian isn't coming.

319
00:20:37,145 --> 00:20:38,455
- Why?
- Oh.

320
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,206
I have to explain about wound cleaning.

321
00:20:40,466 --> 00:20:42,044
When will the guardian be here?

322
00:20:45,009 --> 00:20:46,385
I'm here.

323
00:20:47,489 --> 00:20:48,737
You are...

324
00:20:49,241 --> 00:20:50,811
I'm Daon's coworker.

325
00:20:51,743 --> 00:20:53,387
Is the wound serious?

326
00:20:53,412 --> 00:20:54,712
Not too bad, but she needs to

327
00:20:54,725 --> 00:20:56,416
clean it properly to avoid scarring.

328
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,512
Scarring?

329
00:20:57,532 --> 00:20:59,352
Is the wound deep enough
to leave a scar?

330
00:20:59,376 --> 00:21:00,644
There's no damage to the bone, right?

331
00:21:00,669 --> 00:21:01,997
Yes, there's no issue.

332
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,660
The medication should be taken

333
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:06,027
three times a day after meals.

334
00:21:06,967 --> 00:21:08,053
This is a scar ointment,

335
00:21:08,078 --> 00:21:09,244
apply it regularly.

336
00:21:11,054 --> 00:21:13,181
This is a heat pack.

337
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:17,978
Here's some water and snacks.

338
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:21,398
I also got slippers, just in case.

339
00:21:22,941 --> 00:21:24,014
I found your number in

340
00:21:24,021 --> 00:21:25,281
the guardian contact section

341
00:21:25,301 --> 00:21:26,354
and called you.

342
00:21:26,695 --> 00:21:28,589
Sorry for asking to meet so suddenly.

343
00:21:28,614 --> 00:21:29,793
It's fine.

344
00:21:33,243 --> 00:21:36,896
How much did all of that cost?

345
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:39,124
- I'll pay you back.
- I didn't buy them expecting repayment.

346
00:21:39,124 --> 00:21:40,781
It doesn't sit right with me.

347
00:21:47,591 --> 00:21:49,364
You remind me of your brother.

348
00:21:49,885 --> 00:21:51,746
I wanted to help, so I did.

349
00:21:52,054 --> 00:21:53,263
You don't have to pay me back.

350
00:21:54,056 --> 00:21:56,141
But if it really bothers you...

351
00:21:58,038 --> 00:21:59,081
Then do this instead.

352
00:22:11,448 --> 00:22:13,007
Do you like my brother?

353
00:22:16,411 --> 00:22:17,579
Ah, well...

354
00:22:18,497 --> 00:22:19,865
My brother has a ridiculously

355
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,363
strong sense of pride.

356
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:22,668
And he's extremely stubborn.

357
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,503
Sometimes, I wonder if he's my brother.

358
00:22:24,503 --> 00:22:25,886
Because he likes to say things

359
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:27,271
without thinking.

360
00:22:28,572 --> 00:22:29,782
But...

361
00:22:30,384 --> 00:22:31,802
He doesn't mean any of it.

362
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:35,889
So, even if he acts like an idiot...

363
00:22:36,556 --> 00:22:38,196
Don't give up on him.

364
00:22:38,642 --> 00:22:40,452
If you stay by his side,

365
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,986
he'll open his heart eventually.

366
00:23:17,889 --> 00:23:19,182
I told you not to come.

367
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:23,196
I have something to talk to you about

368
00:23:23,223 --> 00:23:24,316
regarding your sister.

369
00:23:24,896 --> 00:23:26,359
There was no guardian yesterday,

370
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,839
so I got the explanation instead.

371
00:23:28,066 --> 00:23:30,276
- You should know as well...
- I'll take care of it.

372
00:23:31,111 --> 00:23:32,237
Don't worry about it.

373
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:36,283
How can I not worry?

374
00:23:36,992 --> 00:23:38,140
Why?

375
00:23:38,623 --> 00:23:40,328
Do you feel too sorry for me
to ignore it?

376
00:23:40,328 --> 00:23:41,596
It's not like that.

377
00:23:41,627 --> 00:23:44,189
- I've never thought of you as pitiful.
- I'm embarrassed!

378
00:24:01,647 --> 00:24:02,982
What's so embarrassing about it?

379
00:24:03,489 --> 00:24:04,622
I've shown you even more

380
00:24:04,629 --> 00:24:05,969
embarrassing sides of myself.

381
00:24:07,189 --> 00:24:09,579
Begging, pleading, clinging to you...

382
00:24:10,275 --> 00:24:12,282
I've shown you all my lowest points.

383
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,868
So just stop it.

384
00:24:15,075 --> 00:24:16,262
You don't have to try so hard

385
00:24:16,276 --> 00:24:17,252
to be by my side.

386
00:24:17,277 --> 00:24:18,862
But I can't stop, what should I do?

387
00:24:20,911 --> 00:24:22,395
I hate that I'm like this.

388
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,860
I feel so pathetic and humiliated

389
00:24:23,885 --> 00:24:24,920
that I just want to die.

390
00:24:25,832 --> 00:24:27,476
But

391
00:24:27,501 --> 00:24:28,514
I just can't let go,

392
00:24:28,534 --> 00:24:29,634
no matter what I do!

393
00:24:32,534 --> 00:24:33,948
Every day is hell.

394
00:24:35,092 --> 00:24:36,592
I pretend to be fine in front of you,

395
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:38,425
but my heart shatters hundreds of times.

396
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:40,189
I said I'd wait,

397
00:24:40,214 --> 00:24:41,527
but what if you never come?

398
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,412
I was so scared that

399
00:24:43,426 --> 00:24:44,459
I couldn't do anything.

400
00:24:49,564 --> 00:24:51,009
So...

401
00:24:53,854 --> 00:24:55,767
Can't you just like me back?

402
00:25:01,243 --> 00:25:02,953
If you tell me not to come, I won't.

403
00:25:04,204 --> 00:25:05,712
If you say you don't want to see me,

404
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:06,737
I'll hide.

405
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:10,001
But please, don't abandon me.

406
00:25:12,838 --> 00:25:15,072
Promise me you won't leave me behind.

407
00:25:19,845 --> 00:25:21,470
No matter how long it takes, I'll wait.

408
00:25:22,264 --> 00:25:23,482
Okay?

409
00:26:28,002 --> 00:26:29,587
What did you want to say?

410
00:26:42,344 --> 00:26:43,797
Why are you giving me this?

411
00:26:44,262 --> 00:26:45,282
You said you'd accept

412
00:26:45,295 --> 00:26:46,532
if I gave you a ring.

413
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:47,837
When did I ever say that?

414
00:26:47,862 --> 00:26:50,281
Then, if I buy one, will you take it?

415
00:26:50,602 --> 00:26:52,273
Alright. I'll take it.

416
00:26:57,859 --> 00:26:59,252
This is how I feel.

417
00:27:00,849 --> 00:27:02,442
Back then, and even now.

418
00:27:04,115 --> 00:27:05,283
It's always been you.

419
00:27:17,087 --> 00:27:18,338
Let's start over.

420
00:27:19,881 --> 00:27:21,508
I promise I'll never leave again.

421
00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:28,723
So please, don't abandon me.

422
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:33,367
Promise me you won't leave me behind.

423
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:57,296
I can't go back.

424
00:28:01,047 --> 00:28:02,507
Too much time has passed.

425
00:28:03,675 --> 00:28:05,427
It's too late to return.

426
00:28:09,848 --> 00:28:11,190
Now I understand.

427
00:28:13,518 --> 00:28:15,004
No matter how much regret comes

428
00:28:15,018 --> 00:28:16,163
after losing something,

429
00:28:16,187 --> 00:28:17,480
it's useless.

430
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:21,868
I'm not going to run away anymore.

431
00:28:25,305 --> 00:28:26,410
I am...

432
00:28:27,907 --> 00:28:29,284
going to follow my heart.

433
00:28:43,548 --> 00:28:44,924
Where are you right now,
Assistant Manager Ju?

434
00:28:45,383 --> 00:28:46,804
I have something to say.

435
00:28:47,591 --> 00:28:48,737
No.

436
00:28:48,762 --> 00:28:50,030
You can't.

437
00:28:50,055 --> 00:28:51,883
You can't do whatever you want.

438
00:28:54,392 --> 00:28:55,649
Let go.

439
00:28:55,821 --> 00:28:57,214
You think everything will be fine

440
00:28:57,239 --> 00:28:58,291
if I just step aside?

441
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,748
Take care of Shin Jaemin first.

442
00:29:02,484 --> 00:29:04,062
The real problem isn't me.

443
00:29:04,361 --> 00:29:05,684
It's that bastard, Shin Jaemin.

444
00:29:07,947 --> 00:29:09,240
The thing that Park Junghoon

445
00:29:09,265 --> 00:29:10,305
did to you...

446
00:29:10,544 --> 00:29:11,604
The reason I had to go

447
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,095
to that overseas program...

448
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:15,001
Everything that happened to you...

449
00:29:15,872 --> 00:29:16,985
It was all orchestrated by

450
00:29:16,992 --> 00:29:18,100
Shin Jaemin behind the scenes.

451
00:29:18,125 --> 00:29:19,507
That can't be true.

452
00:29:20,143 --> 00:29:21,227
Jaemin hyung would never...

453
00:29:21,258 --> 00:29:22,593
About Jaemin...

454
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:24,647
I think he's a bit strange.

455
00:29:24,672 --> 00:29:25,985
I never told anyone that

456
00:29:25,992 --> 00:29:27,672
I was working there.

457
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:29,173
Him suddenly showing up like that

458
00:29:29,194 --> 00:29:30,001
was strange.

459
00:29:30,033 --> 00:29:31,664
And the fact that

460
00:29:32,013 --> 00:29:33,932
he appeared right after I got hurt.

461
00:29:34,391 --> 00:29:35,891
It doesn't feel like a coincidence.

462
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,859
Are you free to meet, hyung?

463
00:29:45,263 --> 00:29:46,775
Do you want to come over to my place?

464
00:30:16,391 --> 00:30:17,641
Come in.

465
00:30:18,685 --> 00:30:19,883
You haven't eaten yet, right?

466
00:30:20,353 --> 00:30:21,891
Let's eat together.

467
00:30:22,063 --> 00:30:23,440
I made pasta too.

468
00:30:26,025 --> 00:30:27,235
Come on, sit down.

469
00:30:28,361 --> 00:30:29,462
Was it you, hyung?

470
00:30:31,114 --> 00:30:32,449
Did you do that to Dasul?

471
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:35,455
Was it really you?

472
00:30:37,704 --> 00:30:39,080
What are you talking about, Daon?

473
00:30:39,289 --> 00:30:41,015
The thing with Park Junghoon,

474
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,156
sending Suhyeon hyung abroad,

475
00:30:44,002 --> 00:30:45,429
was that all your doing?

476
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,058
Yeah.

477
00:30:56,931 --> 00:30:58,321
I did it.

478
00:30:59,267 --> 00:31:00,298
Why?

479
00:31:02,298 --> 00:31:04,024
Is that not allowed?

480
00:31:04,444 --> 00:31:06,407
- Why?
- Because I love you.

481
00:31:08,526 --> 00:31:09,944
I did it all for you.

482
00:31:11,779 --> 00:31:13,388
You did it because

483
00:31:13,717 --> 00:31:15,001
you love me?

484
00:31:16,284 --> 00:31:17,857
That doesn't make it right!

485
00:31:45,939 --> 00:31:47,398
Let's talk again later.

486
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:09,790
Hyung!

487
00:32:59,429 --> 00:33:00,530
Tell me.

488
00:33:00,575 --> 00:33:01,595
Which part of my face

489
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,662
is the most handsome?

490
00:33:03,766 --> 00:33:05,977
No, I wasn't looking at your face.

491
00:33:08,771 --> 00:33:10,539
I was looking at the ring on your hand.

492
00:33:11,075 --> 00:33:12,271
The ring?

493
00:33:14,235 --> 00:33:15,403
If you like it, you can have it.

494
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:18,781
Umm, no.

495
00:33:22,991 --> 00:33:24,554
But...

496
00:33:24,579 --> 00:33:26,280
how much does a ring like that cost?

497
00:33:26,914 --> 00:33:28,195
This? Not much.

498
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:30,405
About ten million won?

499
00:33:31,794 --> 00:33:33,325
Ten million won?

500
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,714
Don't worry, I won't ask you

501
00:33:35,734 --> 00:33:36,747
to buy me one.

502
00:33:38,259 --> 00:33:40,011
Why would I buy a ring for you, hyung?

503
00:33:47,101 --> 00:33:48,411
Then...

504
00:33:48,436 --> 00:33:49,979
if I buy it for you, will you take it?

505
00:33:52,732 --> 00:33:54,167
Should I just go home?

506
00:33:54,192 --> 00:33:55,278
What? You've been here less

507
00:33:55,292 --> 00:33:56,086
than ten minutes.

508
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,575
Someone's coming.

509
00:34:02,617 --> 00:34:04,406
Alright. I'll take it.
