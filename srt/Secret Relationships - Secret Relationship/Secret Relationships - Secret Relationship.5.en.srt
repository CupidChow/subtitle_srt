Jaemin hyung.

00:00:19,596 --> 00:00:20,853

00:00:29,856 --> 00:00:31,066
This...

7
00:00:32,108 --> 00:00:34,027
I bought one for you while getting mine.

8
00:00:38,531 --> 00:00:39,824
I was really drunk yesterday, right?

9
00:00:40,575 --> 00:00:42,369
I don't remember how I got home at all.

10
00:00:42,369 --> 00:00:43,787
You really don't remember?

11
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:47,423
Did I do something wrong?

12
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:49,709
Yes. Very wrong.

13
00:00:53,546 --> 00:00:54,900
We kissed yesterday.

14
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,065
Judging by your face,

15
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,118
you have your answer.

16
00:01:09,646 --> 00:01:11,135

But, that Shin Jae...

Never mind.

We kissed yesterday.

Why the hell did I do that?

Daon, where are you?

30
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:13,293
If Kim Suhyeon comes looking for you…

31
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,618
Daon suddenly had plans come up,

32
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:31,624
so he can't make it.

33
00:02:31,649 --> 00:02:33,216
How about just meet between us?

34
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,808
Plans?

35
00:02:37,317 --> 00:02:38,460
Sorry.

36
00:02:38,485 --> 00:02:39,899
I was busy and just saw this.

37
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:41,539
Do you have time for a bit?

38
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:52,281
Hey, Kim Suhyeon.

39
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,751
Are you kidding me?

40
00:02:55,084 --> 00:02:56,461
You said you'd give it your all,

41
00:02:57,003 --> 00:02:58,412
but you went and ruined the meeting

42
00:02:58,433 --> 00:02:59,572
with Pilgang Industries?

43
00:02:59,923 --> 00:03:01,120
There were circumstances.

44
00:03:01,674 --> 00:03:02,900
I'll list other firms and

45
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,236
meet them in order,

46
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,470
so I'll report back next week...

47
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,360
What, a report?

48
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:10,325
I put you in that position

49
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,587
not because of your mother's request,

50
00:03:11,768 --> 00:03:13,661
not because I don't trust your sister,

51
00:03:13,686 --> 00:03:14,649
but because I thought

52
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:15,790
you deserved a chance.

53
00:03:15,814 --> 00:03:17,774

take responsibility

Do you even understand

57
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:23,108
how important that project is?

58
00:03:23,988 --> 00:03:26,199
Others would kill

59
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:28,243
for an overseas post,

60
00:03:28,243 --> 00:03:29,744
and all the so-called director can do

61
00:03:29,744 --> 00:03:30,787
is ruin meetings.

62
00:03:30,787 --> 00:03:32,138
Overseas post?

63
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,777
The resort project. The bid.

64
00:03:35,802 --> 00:03:36,976
Win it, no matter what.

65
00:03:37,043 --> 00:03:38,962
That's the last chance I'm giving you.

It's already lunchtime.

69
00:04:37,103 --> 00:04:38,540
I'll eat with you today.

70
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,857
Oh, you too? Sounds good.

71
00:04:40,857 --> 00:04:42,021
Let's go.

72
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,129
Enjoy your meal.

73
00:04:46,154 --> 00:04:48,131
Aren't you eating, Assistant Manager Ju?

74
00:04:48,156 --> 00:04:49,366
I have plans.

Assistant Manager Ju

76
00:04:56,205 --> 00:04:58,249
seems to be looking down all day.

77
00:04:58,249 --> 00:04:59,267
Yeah.

78
00:04:59,292 --> 00:05:00,853
Is something wrong?

79
00:05:06,679 --> 00:05:09,166
If you have a moment, can we talk?

80
00:05:22,982 --> 00:05:24,372
Let's eat.

81
00:05:24,974 --> 00:05:27,045
- No.
- I'll buy you something tasty.

82
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,521
I said no.

83
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,533
We're on the same team,

84
00:05:30,558 --> 00:05:32,134
we can at least have a meal together.

85
00:05:32,158 --> 00:05:33,368
Am I right?

86
00:05:34,111 --> 00:05:35,176
Why? Is this one of those

87
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:36,651
"depends on the person" things too?

88
00:05:41,584 --> 00:05:42,786
- Let's go.
- Huh?

89
00:05:42,811 --> 00:05:43,923
I said let's go eat.

90
00:05:44,212 --> 00:05:45,678
You just said you wouldn't.

91
00:05:45,703 --> 00:05:47,106
I'm eating.

92
00:05:47,131 --> 00:05:48,672
So hurry up and go.

93
00:05:51,511 --> 00:05:52,792
What do you want to eat?

94
00:05:53,471 --> 00:05:54,864
How about pasta?

95
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:55,943
Should we go to that place

96
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:57,142
we used to go to in university?

97
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:58,549
Drop me off in front.

98
00:05:58,685 --> 00:05:59,788
Lunch break is almost over,

99
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,788
I need to go back.

100
00:06:02,021 --> 00:06:03,581
How long will you act as you please?

101
00:06:03,606 --> 00:06:05,518
You always do whatever you want, too.

102
00:06:06,234 --> 00:06:07,714
I do whatever I want?

103
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,644
Should I show you what it really

104
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,215
looks like when I do whatever I want?

105
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:12,566
Starting tomorrow, you're off the

106
00:06:12,591 --> 00:06:13,796
resort construction TF team.

107
00:06:14,784 --> 00:06:16,869
Leave that and come work under me.

108
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:19,251
It's much easier work,

109
00:06:19,276 --> 00:06:20,516
we can see each other more often.

110
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:21,797
What if I refuse?

111
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,134
I'm the director. I said you're out.

112
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:25,572
What can a mere employee

113
00:06:25,597 --> 00:06:26,621
like you do about it?

114
00:06:28,214 --> 00:06:29,831
I'll find a way.

115
00:06:41,821 --> 00:06:43,030
Just why?

116
00:06:44,105 --> 00:06:45,597
Is it for the overseas branch transfer?

117
00:06:46,107 --> 00:06:47,698
Why do you even want to go there?

118
00:06:49,152 --> 00:06:50,278
It has nothing to do with you.

119
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,291
Don't tell me it's because

120
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:53,248
of Shin Jaemin?

121
00:06:53,448 --> 00:06:54,788
No, wait. Is it because of

122
00:06:54,788 --> 00:06:55,908
Ju Seonghyeon?

123
00:06:57,118 --> 00:06:58,422
Answer me!

124
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:12,508
Do as I say and step down from the team.

125
00:07:12,508 --> 00:07:14,359
Why should I listen to you?

126
00:07:14,384 --> 00:07:16,863
You listen to Jaemin, but not me?

127
00:07:16,888 --> 00:07:19,028
Because Jaemin is different from you.

128
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,893
Different? How? In what way?

129
00:07:21,893 --> 00:07:22,994
Let go.

130
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:24,270
If you knew what kind
of guy he really is,

131
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,372
- would you still say that?
- I said, let go!

132
00:07:26,397 --> 00:07:27,494
Damn it, Shin Jaemin this,

133
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:28,941
Shin Jaemin that!

134
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,748
(This year, it still came to visit)

135
00:07:49,773 --> 00:07:52,034
(Ghost Between)

136
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:03,175
Umm...

137
00:08:06,896 --> 00:08:09,023
What do you expect me to do?

138
00:08:30,505 --> 00:08:31,714
Your cheek...

139
00:08:47,353 --> 00:08:49,089
What are you doing?

140
00:08:52,261 --> 00:08:53,495
Give it to me.

141
00:08:53,943 --> 00:08:55,269
I'll do it.

142
00:08:57,202 --> 00:08:58,503
Assistant Manager Ju, I'll...

143
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:04,890
Why do you keep making me

144
00:09:04,903 --> 00:09:05,920
care about you?

145
00:09:07,832 --> 00:09:08,924
You're the one who keeps

146
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:09,972
taking care of me first.

147
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:14,425
Just...

148
00:09:14,797 --> 00:09:16,299
You could just ignore me.

149
00:09:18,551 --> 00:09:19,926
Because I regretted it.

150
00:09:21,554 --> 00:09:22,576
I shouldn't have said to

151
00:09:22,582 --> 00:09:23,704
pretend it never happened.

152
00:09:25,641 --> 00:09:26,957
I shouldn't have ignored it

153
00:09:28,436 --> 00:09:29,855
when you called that person's name.

154
00:09:31,689 --> 00:09:32,970
That person?

155
00:09:35,318 --> 00:09:36,569
Who is Shin Jaemin?

156
00:09:41,219 --> 00:09:42,461
Jaemin hyung.

157
00:09:45,995 --> 00:09:47,588
Is he someone you like?

158
00:09:48,998 --> 00:09:50,365
It was a mistake.

159
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,210
I don't know why I did that.

160
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,211
Can't you just not like him?

161
00:09:55,546 --> 00:09:56,822
Because I can't stop pretending

162
00:09:56,823 --> 00:09:57,895
like I don't liking you.

163
00:09:58,925 --> 00:10:00,635
So don't like him.

164
00:10:07,099 --> 00:10:08,417
I'm not confident.

165
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:12,651
You could just come to me.

166
00:10:14,273 --> 00:10:15,882
I can do better.

167
00:10:22,198 --> 00:10:23,299
I...

168
00:10:24,867 --> 00:10:26,577
I'm not as good a person

169
00:10:27,346 --> 00:10:28,718
as you think I am.

170
00:10:30,957 --> 00:10:32,750
I might only end up hurting you.

171
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,101
I don't care.

172
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:37,922
Even if I get hurt,

173
00:10:39,048 --> 00:10:40,466
I don't care.

174
00:10:43,386 --> 00:10:44,487
Then...

175
00:10:45,763 --> 00:10:47,536
Just let me stay by your side.

176
00:10:48,929 --> 00:10:50,575
That much, you can do, right?

177
00:10:51,978 --> 00:10:53,431
Right?

178
00:11:42,882 --> 00:11:44,530
It's done.

179
00:11:53,789 --> 00:11:55,082
Are you feeling sick?

180
00:11:56,012 --> 00:11:57,269
Your complexion...

181
00:11:58,914 --> 00:12:00,051
It's just hot.

182
00:12:17,702 --> 00:12:19,286
(Secretary Oh)

183
00:12:22,835 --> 00:12:24,106
Look into everything regarding

184
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,797
the resort construction project bid.

185
00:12:25,821 --> 00:12:27,348
How likely it is to succeed,

186
00:12:27,354 --> 00:12:28,759
how far it's progressed,

187
00:12:28,783 --> 00:12:30,571
what its weaknesses are.

188
00:12:30,596 --> 00:12:32,111
Find out everything.

189
00:12:32,136 --> 00:12:34,930
I need to ruin it no matter what.

190
00:12:59,313 --> 00:13:00,797
Hyung.

191
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,583
I was really sorry about that day.

192
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,448
If you have time...

193
00:13:05,238 --> 00:13:06,823
Assistant Manager, are you asleep?

194
00:13:06,848 --> 00:13:07,848
(Assistant Manager Ju Seonghyeon)

195
00:13:07,873 --> 00:13:09,560
(Assistant Manager, are you asleep?)

196
00:13:09,585 --> 00:13:10,921
No.

197
00:13:10,946 --> 00:13:15,093
(Assistant Manager Ju Seonghyeon)

198
00:13:15,118 --> 00:13:16,851
(Decline, accept)

199
00:13:20,644 --> 00:13:21,811
Hello?

200
00:13:21,836 --> 00:13:22,937
Assistant Manager.

201
00:13:22,962 --> 00:13:24,344
What are you wearing tomorrow?

202
00:13:24,369 --> 00:13:25,757
What am I wearing tomorrow?

203
00:13:27,653 --> 00:13:31,452
Probably a black coat or black slacks…

204
00:13:31,585 --> 00:13:32,519
Don't you have anything

205
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,531
in a lighter color?

206
00:13:41,647 --> 00:13:43,390
I do have a beige coat…

207
00:13:43,582 --> 00:13:44,975
Beige is nice.

208
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:47,105
Then, wear that tomorrow.

209
00:13:47,319 --> 00:13:48,937
You're going to wear those penny loafers

210
00:13:48,943 --> 00:13:50,132
you always wear, right?

211
00:13:50,156 --> 00:13:51,799
Yeah, I think so…

212
00:13:51,824 --> 00:13:53,240
Alright, got it.

213
00:14:09,383 --> 00:14:10,651
Oh?

214
00:14:10,676 --> 00:14:11,758
I also felt like wearing

215
00:14:11,782 --> 00:14:13,462
something light today.

216
00:14:13,517 --> 00:14:14,780
What a coincidence, huh?

217
00:14:14,805 --> 00:14:16,041
I knew that the Assistant Jung

218
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,611
really suits the brighter colors.

219
00:14:23,243 --> 00:14:25,048
Huh? What's this? You two?

220
00:14:25,566 --> 00:14:28,433
Are you guys matching outfits?

221
00:14:28,579 --> 00:14:30,488
- It's not like that.
- Then don't tell me…

222
00:14:33,321 --> 00:14:34,696
You went shopping together?

223
00:14:35,618 --> 00:14:37,970
Manager, it's not like that.

224
00:14:37,995 --> 00:14:39,110
I just asked him yesterday

225
00:14:39,116 --> 00:14:40,176
and on purpose…

226
00:14:41,644 --> 00:14:43,198
It just happened by chance.

227
00:14:44,628 --> 00:14:46,086
Right? Assistant Manager Ju?

228
00:14:48,033 --> 00:14:49,706
Yeah, by chance.

229
00:14:49,731 --> 00:14:51,314
Alright. Get back to work.

230
00:14:52,176 --> 00:14:53,590
Yes, sir.

231
00:14:58,182 --> 00:14:59,624
Assistant Manager Jung, do you want

232
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:00,917
to have lunch together later?

233
00:15:00,947 --> 00:15:02,520
- Sure.
- R... Really?

234
00:15:02,721 --> 00:15:04,955
- Yeah.
- Then I'll save us a spot.

235
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,174
No need to go that far.

236
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:11,365
Good afternoon, Manager.

237
00:15:14,733 --> 00:15:16,534
Assistant Jung! Here, here, here!

238
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:18,647
Come over here. Hurry up!

239
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:32,598
Are there mosquitoes in winter?

240
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:34,743
Assistant Manager Jung!

241
00:15:35,427 --> 00:15:37,112
Wait for me!

242
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:38,618
- Sorry.
- Assistant Manager Jung!

243
00:15:40,516 --> 00:15:42,520
Let's go together!

244
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,817
Oh, Assistant Manager!

245
00:15:45,729 --> 00:15:47,161
Assistant Manager Jung!

246
00:15:48,466 --> 00:15:49,485
I said let's go together.

247
00:15:49,486 --> 00:15:51,109
Why are you walking ahead without me?

248
00:15:51,324 --> 00:15:52,589
Why do you keep doing this?

249
00:15:53,195 --> 00:15:54,411
Doing what?

250
00:15:54,436 --> 00:15:55,460
Didn't you ask me to just

251
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,460
let you stay by my side?

252
00:15:56,763 --> 00:15:58,278
I did.

253
00:15:58,826 --> 00:16:00,369
Someone who just wants to be by my side,

254
00:16:00,369 --> 00:16:02,454
why do they walk so close in a crowd,

255
00:16:02,454 --> 00:16:03,581
save a seat for me,

256
00:16:03,581 --> 00:16:05,041
and brush lint off my clothes?

257
00:16:05,066 --> 00:16:06,487
That's not just staying by my side.

258
00:16:09,086 --> 00:16:10,351
So…

259
00:16:10,945 --> 00:16:12,022
Was it uncomfortable for you?

260
00:16:12,047 --> 00:16:13,215
It's not that it was uncomfortable.

261
00:16:13,215 --> 00:16:14,466
There are just a lot of
people in the office.

262
00:16:14,466 --> 00:16:16,035
Then is it okay outside the office?

263
00:16:16,664 --> 00:16:19,008
- Huh?
- Right now, we're outside the office.

264
00:16:19,263 --> 00:16:20,765
Let's go eat together.

265
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:22,675
I found a really great restaurant

266
00:16:22,687 --> 00:16:23,687
around here.

267
00:16:24,518 --> 00:16:25,713
Come on.

268
00:16:29,442 --> 00:16:30,840
You said we were going to eat.

269
00:16:31,442 --> 00:16:33,027
Don't you know about appetizers
before a meal?

270
00:16:53,922 --> 00:16:55,140
Alright.

271
00:16:56,592 --> 00:16:57,943
Shall we go take pictures?

272
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,723
This one?

273
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,856
Yeah, this one.

274
00:17:04,344 --> 00:17:05,608
(Please select a shooting method)

275
00:17:05,633 --> 00:17:06,858
(The shooting will start now)

276
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,880
Try posing like this.

277
00:17:16,904 --> 00:17:18,364
V-sign.

278
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,488
What should we do for the last one?

279
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,550
Like this.

280
00:17:31,949 --> 00:17:33,441
(Receive the photo here)

281
00:17:35,613 --> 00:17:37,316
If you keep staring at it,
the photo will wear out.

282
00:17:37,341 --> 00:17:38,361
If it wears out,

283
00:17:38,373 --> 00:17:39,627
we can just take another one.

284
00:17:41,136 --> 00:17:42,737
There they are.

285
00:17:46,392 --> 00:17:48,369
- Jung Daon!
- Daon!

286
00:17:48,394 --> 00:17:50,244
What are the chances
we'd run into you here?

287
00:17:50,372 --> 00:17:51,697
Mind if we join you?

288
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,960
- Sorry, but we were just...
- Hello.

289
00:17:56,985 --> 00:17:58,595
I'm Choi Geunho, Daon's friend.

290
00:17:59,103 --> 00:18:01,095
What's your relationship with Daon?

291
00:18:01,365 --> 00:18:02,571
Colleagues?

292
00:18:03,134 --> 00:18:04,576
- Yes.
- Ah...

293
00:18:10,374 --> 00:18:12,292
Man, that day was really fun.

294
00:18:12,678 --> 00:18:14,102
That day you couldn't come because

295
00:18:14,102 --> 00:18:15,144
of your company dinner.

296
00:18:17,631 --> 00:18:18,913
Sorry.

297
00:18:19,275 --> 00:18:20,611
The company dinner came up suddenly.

298
00:18:21,051 --> 00:18:22,816
You sure it was really a company dinner?

299
00:18:23,382 --> 00:18:24,640
Yeah.

300
00:18:25,681 --> 00:18:27,374
Okay, let's all get together soon then.

301
00:18:27,505 --> 00:18:29,044
Jaemin couldn't make it that day either,

302
00:18:29,045 --> 00:18:30,045
he was busy.

303
00:18:30,978 --> 00:18:32,071
Ah...

304
00:18:32,813 --> 00:18:34,157
Okay.

305
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:35,620
Looks like things are going well

306
00:18:35,639 --> 00:18:36,832
for you these days, right?

307
00:18:37,401 --> 00:18:38,868
Your clothes look nice.

308
00:18:39,129 --> 00:18:40,762
Eating out at places like this too.

309
00:18:41,739 --> 00:18:43,407
Yeah, getting a job helped a lot.

310
00:18:43,782 --> 00:18:46,160
Wow, would you look at that...

311
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,262
Should we call it
a rags-to-riches story?

312
00:18:48,287 --> 00:18:49,413
Hey, you remember, right?

313
00:18:49,413 --> 00:18:50,564
Back in college,

314
00:18:50,565 --> 00:18:52,103
Daon always had nosebleeds,

315
00:18:52,127 --> 00:18:53,392
so he got called 'bloody guy.'

316
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:54,435
Oh yeah!

317
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,466
That's why he always

318
00:18:55,472 --> 00:18:57,152
carried tissues with him.

319
00:18:57,838 --> 00:19:00,177
Man, he really had it rough

320
00:19:00,202 --> 00:19:01,617
in university.

321
00:19:02,176 --> 00:19:03,419
He only had a few clothes,

322
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:05,245
working part-time every day until

323
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,002
he looked like a walking corpse.

324
00:19:09,099 --> 00:19:10,768
I need to use the restroom for a moment.

325
00:19:11,643 --> 00:19:12,861
Huh?

326
00:19:14,146 --> 00:19:15,513
You and Daon...

327
00:19:15,814 --> 00:19:17,274
Seem pretty close, huh?

328
00:19:18,942 --> 00:19:20,277
Why do you want to know?

329
00:19:21,069 --> 00:19:22,381
It's nothing...

330
00:19:26,074 --> 00:19:27,370
You see...

331
00:19:28,327 --> 00:19:29,995
Just don't be too nice to Daon.

332
00:19:30,535 --> 00:19:31,555
Daon is...

333
00:19:32,186 --> 00:19:33,446
People always felt bad for him

334
00:19:33,447 --> 00:19:35,127
and took care of him.

335
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,802
But he could never tell the difference

336
00:19:36,802 --> 00:19:38,474
between kindness and affection.

337
00:19:39,225 --> 00:19:40,589
If someone was just a little nice

338
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,602
to him, he liked them.

339
00:19:42,174 --> 00:19:43,175
Be careful.

340
00:19:44,426 --> 00:19:46,011
I think you've misunderstood something.

341
00:19:48,013 --> 00:19:49,195
The one who has feelings here

342
00:19:49,214 --> 00:19:50,241
isn't Assistant Jung. It's me.

343
00:19:50,265 --> 00:19:51,975
And it's not out of pity, either.

344
00:19:53,477 --> 00:19:54,789
Ah...

345
00:19:55,437 --> 00:19:56,443
I just said it because

346
00:19:56,443 --> 00:19:57,372
I'm close to him...

347
00:19:57,397 --> 00:19:58,686
Even if you're close,

348
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:01,068
you should know your boundaries.

349
00:20:09,868 --> 00:20:10,953
Let's go.

350
00:20:18,961 --> 00:20:20,226
I'm sorry.

351
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,573
You had to deal with someone

352
00:20:22,574 --> 00:20:23,992
you don't even know because of me…

353
00:20:27,678 --> 00:20:29,531
That's not what made me uncomfortable.

354
00:20:29,556 --> 00:20:30,564
That damn guy...

355
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:32,721
No, that person

356
00:20:33,228 --> 00:20:35,655
talked so casually about someone I like.

357
00:20:36,186 --> 00:20:37,252
That's what bothered me

358
00:20:37,265 --> 00:20:38,276
and pissed me off.

359
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:44,614
Assistant Manager Jung.

360
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,374
I don't like seeing people

361
00:20:47,399 --> 00:20:48,446
I care about get hurt.

362
00:21:00,721 --> 00:21:01,753
- Hello.
- Hello.

363
00:21:01,778 --> 00:21:03,839
Oh, hey. Get home safe.

364
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:14,059
Hyung.

365
00:21:15,601 --> 00:21:16,727
I told you to talk on the phone.

366
00:21:18,729 --> 00:21:19,759
I figured it'd be faster

367
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:20,971
to tell you in person.

368
00:21:22,024 --> 00:21:23,667
I looked into what you asked.

369
00:21:23,692 --> 00:21:25,106
Asked?

370
00:21:26,737 --> 00:21:27,885
What did I ask?

371
00:21:29,675 --> 00:21:31,008
Not asked.

372
00:21:31,033 --> 00:21:32,426
I said I'd look into it myself.

373
00:21:32,451 --> 00:21:34,119
There really was a work dinner.

374
00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:36,531
And today, he was with some guy.

375
00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:38,820
I think it was the guy

376
00:21:38,827 --> 00:21:39,954
you were talking about.

377
00:21:41,418 --> 00:21:43,837
They seemed pretty close.

378
00:21:46,965 --> 00:21:48,607
Alright. Good work.

379
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:50,063
Thank you.

380
00:21:50,761 --> 00:21:52,561
Hyung, about that investment info

381
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,921
you mentioned...

382
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,272
I'll email it to you.

383
00:21:56,939 --> 00:21:58,946
Thank you very much!

384
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,698
What exactly do you need?

385
00:22:35,574 --> 00:22:36,765
You look busy.

386
00:22:39,685 --> 00:22:41,311
Trying to keep my mom happy.

387
00:22:44,272 --> 00:22:45,878
How did you know I was here?

388
00:22:46,942 --> 00:22:48,184
That's

389
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,543
easy.

390
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:51,741
If you have something to say,

391
00:22:51,741 --> 00:22:52,631
say it fast.

392
00:22:52,656 --> 00:22:54,616
As you can see, I'm exhausted.

393
00:22:58,772 --> 00:23:00,320
I was wondering if you met Daon.

394
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,462
You did.

395
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,303
But I guess you couldn't say anything?

396
00:23:07,129 --> 00:23:08,416
Not that I couldn't.

397
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:10,291
I just didn't say it.

398
00:23:12,342 --> 00:23:13,342
He avoids the topic

399
00:23:13,342 --> 00:23:14,323
whenever you come up.

400
00:23:15,804 --> 00:23:16,917
Seems like he's not curious

401
00:23:16,918 --> 00:23:17,972
about you at all anymore.

402
00:23:18,849 --> 00:23:19,924
You don't have the luxury

403
00:23:19,924 --> 00:23:21,002
of taking it easy.

404
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:22,724
It looks like he has

405
00:23:22,724 --> 00:23:23,628
someone next to him.

406
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:24,715
Ah...

407
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,257
That bastard?

408
00:23:26,481 --> 00:23:28,025
He's just a coworker.

409
00:23:31,028 --> 00:23:32,154
It's moments like this
that make me think...

410
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,226
maybe that's why

411
00:23:34,251 --> 00:23:35,323
Daon got stolen from you.

412
00:23:35,907 --> 00:23:37,506
Even though you were right next to him,

413
00:23:37,951 --> 00:23:39,619
you were clueless to notice anything.

414
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:43,539
Watch your words.

415
00:23:44,374 --> 00:23:45,919
The one who lost him was you, not me.

416
00:23:46,418 --> 00:23:47,768
The idiot by Jung Daon's side

417
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:48,871
for 11 years and still

418
00:23:48,871 --> 00:23:50,255
couldn't do anything.

419
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:51,607
That was you, right?

420
00:23:54,468 --> 00:23:55,719
Whether you're the idiot

421
00:23:56,511 --> 00:23:57,679
or I am...

422
00:23:58,388 --> 00:23:59,638
We'll see.

423
00:24:05,937 --> 00:24:07,265
Oh, and...

424
00:24:08,482 --> 00:24:11,350
Stop tailing people like a creep.

425
00:24:13,028 --> 00:24:14,071
It's pathetic.

426
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:27,970
Assistant Manager Jung,

427
00:24:27,977 --> 00:24:28,994
I have a question.

428
00:24:29,878 --> 00:24:30,948
What is it?

429
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:33,587
Are you working so hard on the TF team

430
00:24:33,612 --> 00:24:35,281
because you want an overseas assignment?

431
00:24:38,845 --> 00:24:40,089
Oh... If it's a secret,

432
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:41,132
I won't ask anymore.

433
00:24:43,778 --> 00:24:45,321
It's not exactly a secret...

434
00:24:47,145 --> 00:24:49,106
You seem to have a lot of secrets.

435
00:24:50,273 --> 00:24:51,309
That's why I want to

436
00:24:51,321 --> 00:24:52,333
know more about you.

437
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,336
Me?

438
00:24:57,447 --> 00:24:58,449
At first, it was about

439
00:24:58,468 --> 00:24:59,558
the overseas assignment.

440
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,994
But not anymore.

441
00:25:04,913 --> 00:25:06,149
Now, I just want to do my best

442
00:25:06,174 --> 00:25:07,343
because it's my job.

443
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:11,044
You say that, but you looked really

444
00:25:11,044 --> 00:25:13,713
happy while preparing for it.

445
00:25:17,008 --> 00:25:19,052
That made me want to work harder too.

446
00:25:20,512 --> 00:25:22,042
You could say it turned into a dream.

447
00:25:23,807 --> 00:25:25,103
A dream...

448
00:25:26,685 --> 00:25:27,942
That's nice.

449
00:25:29,229 --> 00:25:30,767
Thanks to you, Assistant Manager Ju,

450
00:25:31,273 --> 00:25:32,858
I think I've found a dream too.

451
00:25:35,443 --> 00:25:36,552
Let's do our best together,

452
00:25:36,552 --> 00:25:37,818
now that we both have dreams.

453
00:25:40,824 --> 00:25:42,175
Thank you.

454
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,243
The word thank you...

455
00:25:43,243 --> 00:25:44,272
I know you said there's

456
00:25:44,291 --> 00:25:45,309
no need to say thanks.

457
00:25:45,537 --> 00:25:46,955
But just for today, I want to.

458
00:25:49,416 --> 00:25:50,825
I want to do something for you too,

459
00:25:50,837 --> 00:25:51,964
Assistant Manager Ju.

460
00:25:53,753 --> 00:25:55,254
Just say the word.

461
00:25:55,281 --> 00:25:56,681
I'll do anything.

462
00:25:59,301 --> 00:26:00,385
There's nothing, really...

463
00:26:02,012 --> 00:26:03,930
Ah, actually, there is one thing.

464
00:26:04,639 --> 00:26:05,849
What is it?

465
00:26:06,195 --> 00:26:07,361
Let's drop the formal speech.

466
00:26:07,642 --> 00:26:09,035
At least when we're alone,

467
00:26:09,054 --> 00:26:10,334
outside of work.

468
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:14,309
Understood.

469
00:26:14,334 --> 00:26:15,465
No,

470
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,102
sure.

471
00:26:28,112 --> 00:26:29,404
Just once.

472
00:26:43,745 --> 00:26:45,002
You're late.

473
00:26:46,631 --> 00:26:47,838
Why did you come here?

474
00:26:49,912 --> 00:26:51,302
I needed to check something.

475
00:26:58,057 --> 00:27:00,471
- Move.
- I don't see a reason to.

476
00:27:02,239 --> 00:27:04,685
Does this punk not know what I am like?

477
00:27:04,866 --> 00:27:05,941
Should I remove him from

478
00:27:05,941 --> 00:27:07,213
the TF team instead of you?

479
00:27:07,546 --> 00:27:10,553
- Hyung...
- Or make him unable to work anymore?

480
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,044
You really don't get it, do you?

481
00:27:16,044 --> 00:27:17,512
Seems like you're not

482
00:27:17,512 --> 00:27:19,106
getting it too, Director.

483
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:20,131
What did you just say, you punk?

484
00:27:26,176 --> 00:27:28,240
Hyung, stop. Please, stop.

485
00:27:28,265 --> 00:27:30,294
Let go. I said let go!

486
00:27:41,653 --> 00:27:42,863
Hyung, stop.

487
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,098
Just stop and go inside.

488
00:27:45,657 --> 00:27:46,918
Go inside?

489
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,395
Go inside your room?

490
00:27:48,794 --> 00:27:49,844
Hurry.

491
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:51,072
Hurry and go inside.

492
00:27:53,409 --> 00:27:54,612
Hey, what do I do?

493
00:27:55,166 --> 00:27:56,668
He's asking me to go in with him.

494
00:28:05,011 --> 00:28:06,277
Don't go.

495
00:28:09,676 --> 00:28:11,293
Please, don't go, Daon.

496
00:28:19,149 --> 00:28:20,352
Please.

497
00:28:48,952 --> 00:28:50,272
As soon as I smelled it,

498
00:28:50,388 --> 00:28:51,435
it reminded me of you,

499
00:28:51,436 --> 00:28:52,528
so I bought this perfume.

500
00:28:53,641 --> 00:28:55,672
Honestly, the scent doesn't even matter.

501
00:28:56,138 --> 00:28:58,056
My head is filled with thoughts of you.

502
00:28:59,033 --> 00:29:00,275
I like you.

503
00:29:01,566 --> 00:29:03,735
I think I like you

504
00:29:05,236 --> 00:29:06,863
more than I think.

505
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:19,494
Suhyeon Hyung.
