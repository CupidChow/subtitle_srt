EPISODE 12

2
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,566
Someone's coming your way.

3
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,485
-Did they find the bug?
-What?

4
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,648
Auntie Im doesn't like loud scenes.

5
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,493
I've got them.

6
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,411
Deal with them quietly
so there are no issues.

7
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,371
Yes, ma'am.

8
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,584
Nam Han-jun, Kong Su-cheol. Wake up!

9
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,337
Those idiots. Unbelievable.

10
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,923
Wake up already! Come on!

11
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,352
Prosecutor Cha.

12
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:27,522
-I saw Gu Tae-su and I was following him.
-Just a second.

13
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,232
NAM HYE-JUN

14
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,152
-Hello?
-Detective.

15
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,237
-Han-jun and Su-cheol have been kidnapped.
-Kidnapped?

16
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,365
Gu Tae-su's dragging them
to the parking lot at the rear gate.

17
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:40,285
Rescue them before they go
somewhere that doesn't have CCTVs.

18
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,786
-You have to hurry!
-Okay.

19
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,959
Mr. Jang, come to the parking lot
at the rear gate now.

20
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:48,877
Okay!

21
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:54,090
I'm so lonely.

22
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:57,802
If it weren't for Mr. Shaman,
I would have ditched you already.

23
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,388
-Don't ditch me.
-Where's your assistant and your car?

24
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:01,514
What?

25
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,100
-I don't know. Damn it.
-Gosh.

26
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:06,895
Stop it. I'm not drunk.

27
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,688
Mr. Shaman's in danger.

28
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:11,065
Mr. Shaman?

29
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,191
What do we do?

30
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,777
Shouldn't we be calling 911 or something?

31
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:15,987
I don't have my phone.

32
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,114
You had to get drunk and lose your phone.

33
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:19,908
-What do we do?
-What do we do?

34
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,492
Let's film them.

35
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:22,869
Call the police right now.

36
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,078
Call 911.

37
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,789
-Hey, they took Mr. Shaman.
-They took Mr. Shaman.

38
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,291
They just went this way.

39
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,418
Did you see the license plate?

40
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,337
Here's the license plate.

41
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,130
It's "70H 2163."

42
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:35,298
Pull over right there.

43
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,135
What's going on?

44
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:40,762
Mr. Nam's been kidnapped.

45
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:42,764
-We have to hurry!
-What?

46
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,891
Let's go. Get in. Go to the back.

47
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,100
What is this?

48
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,853
-Let's go!
-Where to?

49
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,271
-Just go.
-Go straight.

50
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,481
This way?

51
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,774
Gosh.

52
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,111
-Goodness.
-Gosh.

53
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,865
They took the Dongnam Interchange
and the exit to Inhae.

54
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,992
They passed the Inhae tollgate
to Jaepyeong.

55
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,119
Requesting a search
for a kidnapping vehicle.

56
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,288
It's a gray van,
license plate number 70H 2163.

57
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,123
It's entering Jaepyeong right now.

58
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,975
No, there aren't any CCTVs there…

59
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,394
No…

60
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:32,230
Crap! Nothing's going right.

61
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,569
Glasses.

62
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:40,905
The glasses.

63
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,914
I told him to pay extra
for a GPS tracker. Jeez.

64
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:53,751
When he comes back, I’m going to kill him.
You're so dead. Damn it.

65
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:08,516
Detective.

66
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,977
Han-jun's glasses have a camera on them.

67
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,980
I'm looking at his surroundings
right now, but…

68
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:16,190
What the fuck? What am I looking at?

69
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,234
Everything looks the same.
How can I find him?

70
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,320
Anyway, I'll send you a link
to the video feed.

71
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,657
The center says
they're tracking the car too,

72
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,076
and they'll let us know
when they find where it is.

73
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,830
It took them less than ten seconds
to exit that tunnel before.

74
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,582
Are there any short tunnels nearby?

75
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,835
There are more than ten of them
around here.

76
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:38,880
We found a suspicious car
at Jaepyeong Industrial Complex.

77
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:40,965
Jaepyeong Industrial Complex…

78
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,967
Make a right turn here.

79
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,912
No. Come on.

80
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,706
Get it together, Nam Hye-jun.

81
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,375
I have to get it together.

82
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,338
The video.

83
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,029
Yes, Detective.

84
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,615
A suspicious vehicle is
at Jaepyeong Industrial Complex,

85
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,992
so we're on our way there.

86
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,953
Detective, I couldn't see
the entire signboard,

87
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:37,248
but I saw the letters "IEND" on it
toward the end of the video.

88
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,167
I'll send you the picture right now.

89
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,376
Yes. Okay.

90
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:46,340
We need to look
for a signboard with “IEND” on it.

91
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:49,969
But it's so dark out,
we can't see that far ahead…

92
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,388
Let's split up and look for it
when we get there.

93
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,307
Jeez, it's dark out here.

94
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:14,160
Damn it. I make my living
with this face, jeez.

95
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,411
You little rat.

96
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,330
How much did you hear?

97
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,540
A rat?

98
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,509
I didn't hear anything. Got it?

99
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,853
If you want to live, you better tell me
how much you heard

100
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,730
and why you're looking into this.

101
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:46,234
If I tell you, are you really going to
let me live?

102
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,737
That hurts.

103
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,739
Get up.

104
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,950
-That hurts.
-Damn it.

105
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,580
If I tell you,
aren't you going to kill us both anyway?

106
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,583
-You little…
-Wait!

107
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,627
Wait. Damn it.

108
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,214
I'll tell you. Fine.

109
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,341
You want to know how much I know.

110
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:17,348
-It hurts.
-Wake up already, you idiot.

111
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,607
Gu Tae-su, I've been
fixated on you this whole time

112
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,109
but not anymore.

113
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:32,238
Turns out it's the bigwigs behind you
who are the real deal.

114
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,490
Lee Myeong-jun.

115
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:38,953
The mayor of Sinmyeong not only raped
an 18-year-old girl

116
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,622
but murdered her too. Didn't he?

117
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,207
So you know that too.

118
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,250
And

119
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,503
I thought Auntie Im was the mastermind
behind you, but…

120
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:51,632
Wake up, you idiot. Wake up.

121
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,845
Cha Seung-won
of Choekang Construction's involved too.

122
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:59,348
A mayor, an assemblyman, and
a high-ranking Prosecutor

123
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,018
were all gathered together
for a land development project?

124
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,312
Don't you think this is a bit too cliché?

125
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,859
It's not a game the likes of you
can understand.

126
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,319
Did Auntie Im say that?

127
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,821
That "it's not a game the likes of you
can understand"?

128
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,077
I knew it.

129
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:23,873
You're just a disposable pawn to her.

130
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:27,376
No wonder she said she'd get rid of you
once the project is finished.

131
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,301
Cut them both and clean the site.

132
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,888
"Cut" us? Not "shut" us up?

133
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,097
Cut what?

134
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,435
Shoot.

135
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,520
Damn it

136
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,025
It's 2163.

137
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,777
We'll get off here and look for it.

138
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,949
-Ma'am. We'll go further down.
-Okay.

139
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,713
Mr. Cha. It's Mr. Nam's glasses.

140
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,093
It's the IEND.

141
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,894
Mr. Jang, we found it.

142
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,234
Goddamn it.

143
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:36,153
Are you fucking kidding me?

144
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,240
Ganging up on me? That's low.

145
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,534
Piss off. I said, piss off!

146
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,536
Gu Tae-su.

147
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,040
I'm bleeding.

148
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,089
Wake up.

149
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,926
Shoot, did I hit him too hard?

150
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,014
Darn it.

151
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:07,685
Jeez, damn it.

152
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,355
-Who the hell hit my head?
-Su-cheol, help me.

153
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,023
-Help.
-What?

154
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:14,775
Who are you guys?

155
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,528
Which one of you just hit my head?
Was it you?

156
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,238
You're dead now, damn it.

157
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,535
Right. So it was you.

158
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:27,621
What kind of a man hits another
guy in the back of the head?

159
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,333
Too bad for you, but
resurrections are a hobby of mine.

160
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:35,921
Get this.

161
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,514
Darn you.

162
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,327
You startled me.

163
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,497
Hey, you idiots.
Hey. You don't want to do that.

164
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:18,589
Jeez!

165
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,888
What? Come on. Let go.

166
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,147
Hey, look.

167
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,398
Are we done here?

168
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,193
Piss off.

169
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,783
Gu Tae-su…

170
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:51,205
-Hey.
-Mr. Jang, here.

171
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:57,670
Ma'am!

172
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:03,217
Gu Tae-su! Hey, you guys follow Han.

173
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,969
Okay. Hey, come on, let's go.

174
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,303
-Okay.
-Ma'am!

175
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,225
This was just a little scuffle
but I'm hungry now.

176
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,060
-Goodness.
-Darn it.

177
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:15,646
Good work.

178
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:18,566
How crazy do you have to be to
whack someone's head this hard?

179
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,067
You shouldn't do that!

180
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,663
How dare you lay a finger on him!

181
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:39,003
You'd all be dead now
if anything had happened to him.

182
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,281
Ma'am!

183
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,365
Ma'am!

184
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,167
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

185
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,294
-Who did this to your face?
-No, it's fine.

186
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,475
Get up.

187
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:43,025
You coward. You thought you could
run away on your own?

188
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,318
Did you?

189
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,072
Gu Tae-su.

190
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,368
Give up already.

191
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,996
-Detective, are you all right?
-Yes, I'm okay.

192
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,998
I've been doing this
for the last 20 years.

193
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:08,676
Gu Tae-su.

194
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:12,179
-No.
-Get out of my way.

195
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,139
Move, or this man dies.

196
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,480
Damn it.

197
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,025
Gu Tae-su.

198
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,529
You're Lim Yeong-ju…

199
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,408
aren't you?

200
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,829
Detective.

201
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,254
Shoot.

202
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,049
I nearly had him.

203
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,343
But Detective,

204
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:55,014
-do you know Lim Yeong-ju?
-Well…

205
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,058
A bit.

206
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,352
I'm not sure, though.

207
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,856
I'll tell you when I know for certain.

208
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:06,650
Okay?

209
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,488
-Let's get up.
-Damn it.

210
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,326
DAEUN POLICE STATION

211
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,370
That reminds me.

212
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,665
Has the Kang Eun-hye case
been taken care of?

213
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,543
It's all been taken care of.
You don't have to worry.

214
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,587
You are as remarkable as ever.

215
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,298
You must have been scared,
with the campaign going on.

216
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:32,176
Of course. I was shaking in my shoes.

217
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,805
Are they really laughing? Are they nuts?

218
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:40,601
Kang Eun-hye's murderer is
the mayor of Sinmyeong?

219
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:45,230
He was elected into office to work
for the people, not kill them.

220
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,607
That son of a bitch.

221
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,485
The rest of those bastards
deserve to die too.

222
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,279
-Those fuckers…
-The director is here.

223
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:53,322
I'm sorry I'm late.

224
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,407
The man of the hour.

225
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,950
You have impeccable timing.

226
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,538
Don't mind me.

227
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,956
So what if he's my brother?

228
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,710
He should be punished for his crimes.

229
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,129
Still, it can't be easy.

230
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,547
Yes, he's right.

231
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,299
He's still your brother.

232
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:15,969
Prosecutor Cha's family history is
his own business.

233
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,638
We…

234
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:19,932
It's okay. And us…

235
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,893
We should be doing our jobs.

236
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,771
If we arrest Gu Tae-su first
and get his statement--

237
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:26,980
If we bring in Gu Tae-su now,

238
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:30,275
Auntie Im will destroy
the evidence and run.

239
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,693
Auntie Im?

240
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,905
You mean the woman
who was in the side annex?

241
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:38,158
The shaman who only sees the best
of the politics and business world.

242
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:41,620
But she's so shrouded in mystery
that we can't find much information.

243
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,038
I see.

244
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,624
We need to find the evidence
that Gu Tae-su has

245
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,835
before they realize
that we're investigating them.

246
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,379
Auntie Im is distrustful of others

247
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,714
and is true to her desires,

248
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,342
which means she has to have something
on all of them.

249
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:58,428
That way, they won't ever betray her.

250
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,014
Gu Tae-su's real name
is Lim Yeong-ju, right?

251
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,433
See if he has any ties to a shaman
called Auntie Im.

252
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:07,938
We'll look for evidence
that will allow us to arrest them both.

253
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:10,858
I'll look into what it is
that the cartel really wants.

254
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,569
What about the guys we arrested today?
Do we let them all go?

255
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,613
It's not like they have any information,
so just let them go.

256
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,199
Let's just focus on catching Gu Tae-su.

257
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,493
But, what about this?

258
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,413
What about me? The victim?
Who's going to pay for this wound?

259
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,707
They look worse off than you do.

260
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,916
No, they don't.

261
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,044
It was self-defense.
I didn't do anything wrong, okay?

262
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,629
Of course, you didn't.

263
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,465
What kind of fool just takes a hit
to the head?

264
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:36,675
-You aren't a fool!
-No.

265
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,302
Who hit my head?

266
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,679
Su-cheol's done nothing wrong. Let's go.

267
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:43,640
Your injuries look bad,
let me drive you home.

268
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:47,186
No, we live in the same neighborhood,
I'll take them.

269
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,275
If those are my options, I'm…

270
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,485
going to go with this one.

271
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,700
I'm equally uncomfortable with both.
What should I do?

272
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,250
It looks bad.

273
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,960
-It's okay.
-Those bastards.

274
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,546
I'm going to kill them!

275
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,846
Do you have any idea how worried I was?

276
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,349
You scared me to death!

277
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,351
I had so many things to worry about!

278
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,144
What about the insurance policies?

279
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,021
What about the loans?

280
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:34,024
-Gosh.
-Come on now. It's okay.

281
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,819
You're pretty scary when you worry,
aren't you?

282
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,613
Hey, you!

283
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,784
Who do you think your brother is?

284
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,119
People might think
you're Su-cheol's sister!

285
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,330
So what? Su-cheol's obviously
the one who got hurt!

286
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:55,087
There's blood right here.

287
00:20:56,088 --> 00:21:00,259
I got hit too. Here and on my side.

288
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:03,804
I got beaten up too,
so why aren't you hugging me?

289
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:07,432
Whatever it is, take care of it yourself.
I'm going to take Su-cheol to his room.

290
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,434
Go over there and reflect on yourself.

291
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:12,521
Jae-hui, could you keep an eye
on Nam Han-jun?

292
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:13,689
Okay.

293
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:18,068
-Let's go.
-No, I'm fine.

294
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:21,238
I just got a small knock to the head.
But I'm fine. I hit them more.

295
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:25,867
The head's the most important part.
You got hit there again?

296
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:29,538
Look at this. This must have hurt so much.

297
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,456
Let's go to the hospital first.

298
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,582
-What the hell?
-Come on.

299
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,755
What's with her? Has she gone crazy?

300
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:42,009
Are you okay? Shouldn't you
go to the hospital too, Mr. Nam?

301
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,468
I'm fine.

302
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,139
Come on, let me see. Your face too.

303
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,181
No!

304
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:52,144
I'm fine. Yes.

305
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,397
It's just a little blood.

306
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,983
You should put ointment on.
It'll get infected if you don't.

307
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,569
-Let me see.
-I'll just let it get infected.

308
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,322
-Wait, no, I need--
-Come on.

309
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,324
Are you sure you don't have
to see a doctor?

310
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,909
It's fine. It's nothing
a good night's sleep won't cure.

311
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,077
Have some tea before you go.

312
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:43,653
What are you looking around for?

313
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,572
You've seen it all before.

314
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:47,824
That was because
you were acting so suspicious.

315
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:55,665
Then I'll take an official tour
of the house this time.

316
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:56,625
Fine.

317
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,474
-You saw it.
-You didn't even recognize me.

318
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,852
But I guess you liked this guy.

319
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,562
It doesn't have any dust on it.

320
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:01,857
Well, I'm not the type
to treat other people’s things lightly.

321
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,608
Give me that.

322
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,360
I assumed you had thrown this away…

323
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,115
I found it in a corner
while cleaning. Give it here.

324
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:11,575
No.

325
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,079
Just give me it.

326
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:43,940
Damn it.

327
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,116
-Are you okay?
-Gosh, it hurts.

328
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,827
Damn it, I landed on my bruises.

329
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,080
Gosh.

330
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,042
You said you were fine.

331
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,336
How is this "fine"?

332
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:07,255
I've never been hurt like this before,
so how was I to know?

333
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,300
Considering these are my only injuries,
I defended myself pretty well.

334
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:12,469
You saw it before, right?
It was 14 against 1.

335
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,889
Nam Han-jun. You're a legend.

336
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:17,849
My goodness.

337
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,061
Mr. Nam. Did that hurt?

338
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:22,812
Come here, let me see.

339
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,397
Damn it, of course it hurts.

340
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,000
VVIP MADAM LEE MIN-GYEONG

341
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,296
Jeez, this girl.

342
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,969
Why isn't she back yet?
She should be back by now.

343
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,804
She's been gone for less than ten minutes.

344
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,055
Ten minutes?

345
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:59,349
Anything could have happened.

346
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:03,103
Are you that worried about your sister?

347
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:05,188
Of course I am.

348
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:09,150
She acts like a crazy person,

349
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,568
but she's got a soft heart.

350
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:14,823
She's always dating because
she's too nice to turn down guys.

351
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,283
Jeez, it's so exasperating.

352
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,410
My brother was like that too.

353
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:23,456
He used to worry about me every day too.

354
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,251
It used to annoy me
because it felt like nagging,

355
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,004
but I miss it now.

356
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:32,966
I envy Hye-jun.

357
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:34,592
You do?

358
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,386
Okay.

359
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:39,973
All right. Then from now on,
consider me your big brother.

360
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:42,517
I was your brother's friend anyway, right?

361
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:47,564
I have no intention of considering you
as my brother, Mr. Nam.

362
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,484
Then what do you want to consider me as?

363
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:52,569
Your boyfriend?

364
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:53,862
Your husband?

365
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,613
What is that what you want?

366
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,867
Jeez, what goes on in that head of yours?

367
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,786
Anyway, I have no intention of considering
you as any of those things,

368
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,121
so you don't have to worry.

369
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,166
That's weird. I seem to remember

370
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,336
that you had a big crush on me before.

371
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,004
That was just

372
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:13,340
for a very short while when I was young.

373
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:15,633
I don't like you at all now.

374
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:20,680
You don't make my heart race. Not one bit.

375
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:21,973
"Not one bit"?

376
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:24,851
That's preposterous.

377
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,062
Look at me.

378
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,397
Come on, are you looking at me?

379
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,024
Look at me, are you doing it?

380
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:35,111
Wait, it doesn't make your heart race
to look at someone as charming as I am?

381
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,114
I'm handsome, smart,

382
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,450
well-mannered, and talented to boot.

383
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,829
I don't make your heart race?

384
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:06,559
Damn it. Who is calling
at this important moment…

385
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,313
"Important moment"?

386
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:14,734
Hye-jun's pretty late. It's getting late…

387
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,279
Yes, right.

388
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,323
That… I mean, how silly of her.

389
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,417
This house is amazing.

390
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,088
Okay.

391
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,175
-It's almost done.
-I'm so hungry.

392
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,635
You're hungry?

393
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,304
What do you want first?

394
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:46,349
I've got freshwater snails
and carrots and cucumbers.

395
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:49,310
-Whatever tastes the best.
-Okay, then. Cucumber first.

396
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,565
This is so good!

397
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:55,900
Su-cheol.

398
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,819
What is it?

399
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:02,240
You've got this great place, so why do
you sleep on our couch all the time?

400
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,283
It gets lonely here.

401
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:05,952
Do you want me to move in?

402
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:08,663
A grown woman like you can't go
around saying things like that.

403
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,540
No, you're going to get into trouble.

404
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:22,343
It's pretty.

405
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:25,597
But does it work?

406
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,265
Yes, of course.

407
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:34,272
Yes, it does.

408
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,902
Hey, did you buy a new camera?

409
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,488
It looks vintage and right up your alley.

410
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:44,574
You know what I like?

411
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:46,075
Yes, I do.

412
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,121
You like old things with a sense of
nostalgia better than new things.

413
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:54,501
And you prefer analog to digital things.

414
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:57,253
You're a shy romantic,
though no one would think so.

415
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,798
You've never managed to tell anyone
you liked them

416
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:02,050
when you were in school, have you?

417
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:03,843
Yes.

418
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:07,096
Well, the thing is…

419
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,891
If you ask me out now, I'll say yes.

420
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,727
-What?
-I know you like me.

421
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,104
Right.

422
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,523
You think I'm pretty, right?

423
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,859
You like me, right?

424
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:24,072
Well, yes. I do like you,

425
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:27,116
but I need more time to find out
how exactly I like you--

426
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:34,666
I'd like it if you'd start
seeing me as a woman…

427
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:38,211
I already do.

428
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:40,338
I already think of you as a woman.

429
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:43,258
You do? That's good.

430
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,886
I'm totally defenseless
and sexy right now.

431
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,098
Do you want to kiss?

432
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:02,402
Come on, don't tease me. Let's go eat.

433
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:23,840
Do you not know that I like you?

434
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,678
When I thought
something might happen to you,

435
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:31,347
I knew for sure.

436
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,099
Knew what?

437
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:34,559
My feelings.

438
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:37,687
That I'd regret it if I didn't tell you.

439
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,648
I like you.

440
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:45,111
My heart races whenever I see you.

441
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,198
What about you?

442
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,160
Well…

443
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:54,704
I…

444
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:58,166
I'm not sure if my heart's racing
because I'm surprised

445
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,376
or because I like you. I need to check--

446
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,502
Then shall we check?

447
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,587
What?

448
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,695
I don't think we should be doing this.

449
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,031
I'm confused whether
this is just my instincts

450
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,991
-or love.
-Su-cheol.

451
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,036
Don't think and just look at me.

452
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,413
Do you like me?

453
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:41,542
Yes.

454
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,921
I like you.

455
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,590
You make me feel like
my heart's going to burst.

456
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,259
But we can't do this.

457
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,523
Han Jang-mi, wake up.

458
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,109
You can't sleep here.

459
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:08,504
I did my best to wake you up, I did.

460
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:11,883
I'm definitely not doing this because
I want to look at you as you sleep.

461
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:24,520
CAFÉ
MINAMDANG

462
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:29,484
You.

463
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:33,321
What did you do to me?

464
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,366
My heart…

465
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,204
My heart feels like it's going to burst.

466
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,757
-The hiccups.
-What?

467
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:55,343
Nam Han-jun can't find out,

468
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,428
so let's find a way
to stop them before we go in.

469
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:00,431
-Yes, okay.
-Just a minute.

470
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:04,102
I need to catch them.

471
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,067
I can't breathe.

472
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,657
What?

473
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:27,083
My gosh, what's this?
Did you two sleep together?

474
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:29,669
No! Well…

475
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,338
we did sleep…

476
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:33,548
but nothing happened.

477
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,843
Right. If something did happen,
we wouldn't be here like…

478
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,012
I'm late! Bye!

479
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:41,973
Bye.

480
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:46,853
Stop laughing.

481
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:48,771
Wait.

482
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,777
Were you two together
this whole time? All night?

483
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:57,655
Well, the thing is…

484
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:58,698
Damn it.

485
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,410
Kong Su-cheol!

486
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:05,204
You'd better tell me everything.

487
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:08,666
Tell me what exactly happened
from the moment you two disappeared,

488
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:11,878
All the details regarding the who,
what, when, where, how, and why.

489
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,963
Or you're dead.

490
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:16,007
What did you do with my sister?

491
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:19,468
East.

492
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,637
West.

493
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,181
What the hell?

494
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,473
South.

495
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:26,934
North.

496
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:32,190
Stop it. I was at an Internet café
all night and ran into him right outside.

497
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,151
You expect me to believe that?
Do you want me to start profiling?

498
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:37,069
Go ahead. Should I show you
where I've been?

499
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:39,906
Yes. We did meet outside. That's right.

500
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:41,532
You still deserve a slap, damn it.

501
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:45,203
If anything happened
between the two of you,

502
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,538
I'm going to kill you, got it?

503
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,373
-What?
-You deserve another slap. Jeez.

504
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,334
East.

505
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,679
Good morning, ma'am.

506
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,307
-Hi.
-What?

507
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,268
You're wearing the same clothes.
Did you sleep out?

508
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:12,813
I was tired after all that work
yesterday and overslept.

509
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:16,025
I didn't even have the time
to wash my hair and came straight…

510
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,111
What about you? Did you sleep here?

511
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,863
Yes, I did.

512
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:24,075
I found the contact number
for the real Gu Tae-su's family.

513
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:25,284
Thanks.

514
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:48,015
-What?
-What did she say?

515
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,394
The missing Gu Tae-su
must've been on bad terms with his family.

516
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:54,230
He was adopted overseas, right?

517
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:55,856
Poor guy.

518
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,067
Don't bother.

519
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,611
He was chosen
because there wouldn't be any trouble.

520
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:03,030
No family and no friends in Korea.

521
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,408
He's the perfect target
for identity theft.

522
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:09,078
But what about the fake Gu Tae-su?
Who's he?

523
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:12,039
When he was here, there were
no matches for his fingerprints.

524
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:15,293
Is that possible? For a Korean adult?

525
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:18,129
It is if he never registered his prints
in the first place.

526
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:19,338
How's that possible?

527
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:23,467
By the way, is Mr. Jang not coming today?

528
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,721
He said he was going to see a doctor
and follow up on something.

529
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,472
I wonder why he went on his own…

530
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,071
It's been a long time.

531
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,193
Stop.

532
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:50,197
Hey, what's with that fat ugly heart?

533
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,700
What do you think it is? It's latte art.

534
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:00,374
Here's your latte.

535
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,834
Thank you.

536
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:11,343
Did you try the big data analysis?

537
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,512
Give me something to analyze first.

538
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:17,016
We only have one company card
that hasn't been used in months.

539
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,185
So what am I supposed to analyze?

540
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,609
Gu Tae-su's used to lying low,

541
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:29,320
so he wouldn't have looked
for a new hideout each time.

542
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:30,821
See if he's been

543
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:33,616
to someplace private
near Joyce Entertainment.

544
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,117
Where would that be?

545
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:39,121
Aren't there any high-end hotels
or private bars or restaurants

546
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,456
on his company card bill?

547
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:45,753
It's been a while,
but there is a restaurant. Forte.

548
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,129
Forte?

549
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,925
-Yes.
-Wait, Gu Tae-su

550
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,426
goes to a hip place like that?

551
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,719
I guess so.

552
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,395
I'd better check it out myself.

553
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,189
What?

554
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:10,486
-Are we going out again?
-I know, when we're swamped.

555
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:12,363
No, I'll go on my own.

556
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:14,990
Su-cheol, you make coffee.

557
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,243
You, take care of this place.

558
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:20,829
And you put
Gu Tae-su's movements onto a map

559
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:24,124
so I can profile it. Okay?

560
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,210
-Okay.
-Okay. Bye, then.

561
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:28,212
-Bye.
-Okay.

562
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,089
-See you later.
-All right!

563
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:34,802
They say there aren't any CCTVs near
the place where the gray van was found,

564
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,845
so they can't trace Gu Tae-su's movements.

565
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,264
Really?

566
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:41,475
Then check out any public transportation
and taxis nearby.

567
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,602
It's a secluded place,

568
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,646
-so he would have needed transport.
-Okay.

569
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,314
And I pulled a list of all the places

570
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,609
where Gu Tae-su used his company card,
just in case.

571
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:55,030
NAM HAN-JUN

572
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,200
Hello? I'm busy right now, can we--

573
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:00,286
This is important.
Let's talk face-to-face.

574
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:03,122
Come to Forte now.
It's a restaurant at Sinmyeong Hotel.

575
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:04,790
-Right now?
-Yes.

576
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:10,963
Jeez, what was that?

577
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:13,882
Isn't Forte a place Gu Tae-su used
to frequent?

578
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,219
Yes, it is.

579
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:21,140
It's a famous venue
for marriage proposals.

580
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:23,851
Proposals?

581
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:26,020
Proposals?

582
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:27,021
Look.

583
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:28,689
Ma'am.

584
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,609
Did you decide on Mr. Shaman?

585
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:34,486
What are you saying?
This is for the investigation.

586
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,447
We aren't like that.

587
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:37,406
"We"?

588
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:39,283
"We"? You just said "we."

589
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,411
Unbelievable. She said "we."

590
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:44,747
I can't believe this.
Don't you have work to do?

591
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:47,333
We'll go back to work then.

592
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:48,417
We'll go investigate.

593
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,377
"We"!

594
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,298
I don't have a lot of time.

595
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,262
Crap.

596
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:08,228
Shoot.

597
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,649
Damn it. I don't have anything to wear.

598
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,276
Makeup.

599
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,487
What do I use?

600
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:21,241
Investigating? Is that what you
meant by something important?

601
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:24,161
Gu Tae-su visited this place quite often.

602
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:29,083
Why? Were you expecting something else?

603
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,459
No, of course not.

604
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:33,545
What could be more important
than investigating like this?

605
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:40,386
-Hi, Mr. Cha.
-Lieutenant Han.

606
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:43,806
I have something I'd like your opinion on.
Are you free right now?

607
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:45,265
I'm sorry.

608
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:48,352
I'm in the middle of investigating.

609
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:50,896
Where?

610
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:52,606
I'll meet you there.

611
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,066
We're…

612
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:55,067
at Forte…

613
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:58,612
No, don't come. Don't bother.

614
00:44:58,695 --> 00:44:59,780
Mr. Nam…

615
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,372
Why does he always trying to butt in?

616
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:13,419
Excuse me.

617
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:35,983
Let's eat here
then check out that bar over there too.

618
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:38,110
We might find a clue about Gu Tae-su.

619
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:43,198
And don't get the wrong idea.
This is a restaurant I bring Hye-jun to.

620
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:46,827
So you're just being nice to me
because I'm like your sister?

621
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:49,371
Yes, exactly.

622
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,248
We need to eat to chase after bad guys.

623
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:59,131
What? I thought he was going
to investigate, but they're just eating.

624
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:01,049
That's a date under the guise
of investigation.

625
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:02,259
That's totally unfair.

626
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:03,594
What is?

627
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:06,388
Come on, look. There they are,
eating at a nice restaurant--

628
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:10,309
I don't mind.
Do you still think it's unfair?

629
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,353
No, it's very fair.

630
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:19,109
Everything's very high-end here.
It's not like Gu Tae-su.

631
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:21,820
You're right.

632
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:27,910
You know, this is actually the first time
a guy has given me flowers.

633
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:29,953
It's just a part of the ruse.

634
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:35,626
Hey, Mr. Cha. You're here early.

635
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:37,336
Am I interrupting anything?

636
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:40,088
No. We're investigating.

637
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:41,757
We heard that Gu Tae-su comes here often.

638
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:46,720
By the way, what did you want
to discuss with me?

639
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:48,138
Well…

640
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,974
It's something private.
We'll talk next time.

641
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:53,894
Seriously?

642
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:57,022
What is it you can't tell her
in front of me? I'm very curious.

643
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:59,691
It's a secret between friends,

644
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,527
so I'm not going to tell you, Mr. Nam.

645
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:07,449
You two don't look close enough
to share secrets.

646
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,076
Come on. Stop that.

647
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:11,620
Mr. Cha, sit.

648
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:12,579
Okay.

649
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:23,632
He is a regular,
but he hasn't been here in weeks.

650
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:25,259
When was the last time he came?

651
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,594
The fourth Thursday of last month.

652
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,681
That's pretty specific.

653
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,643
Every fourth Thursday at 8 p.m.

654
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:36,061
He's never missed it.

655
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:38,438
Did he come by himself?
Was there anyone with him?

656
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:41,567
I've never seen him come with anyone else.

657
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:44,236
By any chance…

658
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:47,573
have you ever seen this man here?

659
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:50,492
Excuse me.

660
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:53,704
I just need to make a call. You go ahead.

661
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:55,163
-Okay.
-Pathetic.

662
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:58,792
Come on, why would you do that?
Read the room.

663
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:04,089
Mr. Nam. This is Cha Do-won.

664
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:07,426
Does Seung-won go to Sinmyeong Hotel
every fourth Thursday?

665
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:08,343
I'm sorry.

666
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:10,887
I can't disclose his schedule
without his permission.

667
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:14,891
I'll take responsibility
if anything happens.

668
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:18,270
He'll be at the office late tonight.

669
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:20,647
You should talk to him in person.

670
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:33,869
Lieutenant Han,
I'm afraid I have to go because of a case.

671
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:35,037
Okay.

672
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:38,248
I'll call you if we find anything.

673
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:50,510
Did you ever talk to him about his life,
or hear anything about it?

674
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,638
He was a very quiet man.

675
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:56,266
Did he ever come any other day
other than the days he usually does?

676
00:48:56,850 --> 00:49:00,479
Well, he has a hobby
that he usually does in the winter,

677
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:04,733
but he did come on a different day
a while back because he got a permit.

678
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:11,490
It's hunting. Spring hunting season is on
to control the wildlife population.

679
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:13,533
So that's why he left those footprints.

680
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:14,493
Footprints?

681
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:16,286
He always gives us a hefty tip

682
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:19,331
because he'd leave
muddy footprints whenever he came.

683
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:20,499
Mud…

684
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,043
How was he dressed?

685
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:26,963
He was usually in suits.
It seemed he had a lot of work dinners.

686
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:31,468
He always smelled faintly of smoke
as if he'd been to a barbecue restaurant.

687
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:36,098
Why didn't I think of that?

688
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:38,850
A mobile home. A trailer.

689
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:40,644
It's a camping site!

690
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:41,728
Yes.

691
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:47,067
Hey. See if Gu Tae-su's movements
overlap with any hunting--

692
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,611
I'm marking all the camping sites
on the map. Wait.

693
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:50,570
How did you know that?

694
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:54,866
I planted a bug and a GPS tracker
on you in case you got kidnapped again.

695
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:56,284
What? Are you crazy?

696
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:07,379
-Can I have a cup of water?
-Okay.

697
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:09,423
It's nothing.

698
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:16,763
DIRECTOR CHA SEUNG-WON

699
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:22,728
-He's in there, right?
-If you could wait…

700
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:25,897
What brings you here?

701
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,524
I wanted to ask you something,

702
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:30,068
but you wouldn't answer your phone,
so I had to come.

703
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:37,367
You know Gu Tae-su, right?

704
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:41,788
He murdered Jeon Gyeong-cheol.
Did you give the orders?

705
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:44,541
What the hell are you talking about?

706
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:47,753
I saw you and Gu Tae-su together
at the ceremony.

707
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:50,797
You met Lee Myeong-jun, Nam Pil-gu,
and Park Jeong-hyeon that day.

708
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,299
Uncle and Auntie Im too.

709
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:55,427
It was just a business meeting.

710
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:57,387
I see. Business?

711
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:00,265
Does that mean

712
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:03,518
Kang Eun-hye's death was
a part of that business too?

713
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:05,645
Auntie Im is that woman
from before, right?

714
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:08,315
The one who made your case go away
under Father's orders.

715
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:13,069
-Did she cover up Kang's case too?
-Shut up. You don't know anything.

716
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:14,362
God.

717
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:18,700
How far are you going to go?

718
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:22,162
Are you willing to do anything
to be the president of Choekang?

719
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:28,543
I haven't seen that look
in your eyes in a while.

720
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:31,713
Sure.

721
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:36,384
You've always looked down on me
and despised me.

722
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:43,058
But do you think
you're that different from me?

723
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:44,142
Yes.

724
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:46,478
At least

725
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,189
I don't cheat like you do.

726
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:51,358
I've gotten here
through my hard work alone.

727
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:53,610
Please.

728
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,782
It wouldn't have been possible for someone
as inflexible as you to do whatever

729
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:02,702
you wanted without your position
as the son of Choekang's president.

730
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:05,539
It wasn't because you were a prosecutor.

731
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,376
If my job can't stop you,

732
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,294
let me advise you as your brother.

733
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:14,965
Whatever you're trying to do,
you should stop.

734
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:16,508
Why?

735
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:20,762
Because you're going to send me to jail
like you did with all our relatives?

736
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:23,431
Yes. The company won't go under
just because you're gone.

737
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:24,724
You punk!

738
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:29,521
If you get in my way,

739
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:32,607
I'll make sure you lose your job.
You be careful.

740
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:38,530
Father shouldn't have cleaned up
after you like that.

741
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:51,209
It's his fault. He ruined you.

742
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:02,679
I've come to give you this final warning
because you're my brother.

743
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:04,389
I'm going to make everything right.

744
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:06,975
You better be ready.

745
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:47,307
I sent you the map with Gu's movements.

746
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:49,893
I'll send you the map
with where he made calls.

747
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:53,021
Wildlife hunting was permitted
in three places last month.

748
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:56,483
Yangseon, Samcheon, and Bongeun.

749
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:59,235
YANGSEON, SAMCHEON, BONGEUN

750
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:04,866
So, his hideout is in one of these places.

751
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:05,784
Yes.

752
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:08,578
A secret hideout that no one knows about,

753
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:10,455
that only he has access to.

754
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:12,207
But there are three camping sites.

755
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:13,667
How do we find him?

756
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,794
Profiling got us this far.

757
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:18,630
Next time, we'll get help
from law enforcement.

758
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:24,928
Ms. Han found possible locations
for Gu Tae-su's hideouts.

759
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:27,931
Mr. Nam and I will go to Samcheon
camping site.

760
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:30,767
Then we'll go to the one next
to it. In Bongeun.

761
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:31,851
Okay.

762
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:36,606
We're the police.

763
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:39,150
Do you know this man?

764
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:43,279
-Him?
-You know him?

765
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:46,449
He's a long-term camper, he moves
his RV between the parking lot here

766
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,201
and the public parking lot down there.

767
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:51,496
-Do you have his license plate number?
-No. He left his RV here

768
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:52,998
and drove away in his sedan.

769
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:56,126
And this is a free parking lot.
We don't register license plate numbers.

770
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:59,629
Okay, let's split up
and look for Gu Tae-su's RV.

771
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:00,964
-This way.
-Okay.

772
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:07,804
-Well done.
-You're so good.

773
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:10,765
Excuse me.

774
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:14,519
Is this the owner of that RV over there?

775
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:18,314
No. That one belongs to a woman.

776
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:20,817
I see.

777
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:23,403
I must have made a mistake.

778
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:25,739
Thank you for your cooperation.

779
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:27,699
-What?
-Have fun.

780
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:32,537
I'll go that way.

781
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:34,039
-I'll go this way, then.
-Okay.

782
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:40,003
You're just going to walk right up to it?

783
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:43,923
Can we go in here?

784
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:44,966
What?

785
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:49,721
Who are you people?

786
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:52,348
I'm sorry.

787
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:55,560
Well, I think we have the wrong car.

788
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:57,896
I got robbed yesterday too.
That was you two, wasn't it?

789
00:55:57,979 --> 00:55:59,522
What? No, that wasn't us.

790
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:00,565
I think it was you.

791
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:02,817
No, it really wasn't us!

792
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:05,153
It wasn't! It wasn't us!

793
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:06,488
You did do it!

794
00:56:42,398 --> 00:56:44,317
Damn it. It's not working.

795
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,168
It's 38,000 won.

796
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:13,680
Thank you.

797
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:23,398
Han.

798
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:25,817
Gu just used his credit card
at a gas station.

799
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:26,901
I found it.

800
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:29,404
It's five kilometers from here.

801
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:30,488
Five kilometers?

802
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:34,325
We'll go that way and follow him.

803
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:37,620
I might have found Gu Tae-su's RV.
I'll get back to you after I check.

804
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:05,732
G
LOG IN

805
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:28,004
-Yes.
-I found Gu Tae-su's RV.

806
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:31,007
There's benzene, the gopuri fabric…
It's definitely Gu Tae-su's.

807
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:33,885
-Where is it?
-It's above the reservoir.

808
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:36,596
Okay. Wait there, I'll be there soon.

809
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:37,680
Okay.

810
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:46,147
His mother kind of looks
like Kang Eun-hye.

811
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:08,169
Open the door!

812
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:21,391
Stop it!

813
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:23,560
Damn it.

814
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:26,062
Gu Tae-su!

815
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:28,606
Gu Tae-su!

816
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:31,943
Gu Tae-su! Open the door!

817
00:59:32,443 --> 00:59:33,570
Open the door!

818
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:36,114
Open the door!

819
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,164
Gu Tae-su! Open the door!

820
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:48,001
Gu Tae-su! No!

821
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:57,760
Gu Tae-su!

822
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:00,305
Open the door!

823
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:02,807
Open the door!

824
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:11,024
Jae-hui?

825
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:17,071
Su-cheol. I think Jae-hui's in danger.
You need to come quickly.

826
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:18,114
Hurry!

827
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:40,345
Who's it going to be, me or her?

828
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:43,723
Help…

829
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:55,568
Mr. Nam…

830
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:08,623
EPILOGUE

831
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,091
Thank you.

832
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:21,427
Hello.

833
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:35,525
Come here.

834
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:43,741
On the count of three. One, two…

835
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:30,246
He was the suspect
in my first murder case.

836
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:31,664
There must have been an accomplice.

837
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:35,001
There's a rumor that drugs
are being dealt in N.Joy Club.

838
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:38,337
So that money is being laundered
and handed out as investment returns?

839
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:40,965
There's ominous energy
coming from the top floor.

840
01:02:41,048 --> 01:02:43,676
-The Royal floor?
-The CCTV in the security room is hacked.

841
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,970
-An inspection report? What's that?
-A ledger of their crimes.

842
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:48,681
So Auntie Im is conning the others?

843
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:51,100
I'll deal with Chairman Park.

844
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:53,186
Arson is Gu Tae-su's trademark.

845
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:54,979
The place where
his identity began to take shape…

846
01:02:55,062 --> 01:03:00,067
