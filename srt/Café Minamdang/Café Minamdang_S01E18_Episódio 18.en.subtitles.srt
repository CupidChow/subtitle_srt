1
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,331
FINALE

2
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:48,506
Mr. Nam,
you have such a hard grip on life.

3
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:00,435
Prosecutor Cha.

4
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,520
I knew you were the killer.

5
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:07,650
Why are you only catching on now?
I'm so disappointed in you.

6
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,490
I just want to know one thing.

7
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,741
Jae-jeong.

8
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,453
Did you kill him with your own hands?

9
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,163
Han Jae-jeong?

10
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:25,960
I have my principles,
so I didn't mean to kill him myself.

11
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,671
But it just ended up that way.

12
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:33,343
Why did you do it? Because he found
the evidence that could bring you in?

13
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,929
If I had to put a reason to it,

14
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:40,058
-I guess it was because of you, Mr. Nam.
-What?

15
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,643
If you hadn't been so arrogant,

16
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,772
running around everywhere,
saying that you'd catch me,

17
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:49,359
Prosecutor Han, Dr. Jung, Auntie Im,

18
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:52,237
none of them would have died like that.

19
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,488
You coward…

20
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,077
Jeez.

21
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,664
Does saying it's my fault,

22
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:05,583
help you justify the delusional
judgment game you're playing?

23
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,503
Does that make you feel
all powerful and righteous?

24
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,591
The power to decide when your life ends.

25
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,554
That sort of thing does
make me feel alive.

26
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,056
"The shaman who was killed

27
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,892
by a serial killer while trying
to rescue a kidnapped detective."

28
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,061
Do you like that as your ending?

29
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,647
You're going to kill me and make
Cha Seung-won the murderer?

30
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:30,358
I'm sorry,

31
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,861
but I'm not that easy to kill.

32
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,905
What happened to your face?

33
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,408
It was those assholes.

34
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,827
You little…

35
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:45,373
How dare you lay a finger
on my colleague? Damn it.

36
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,439
-Come here.
-Hey.

37
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:27,415
Jeez. It's so freaking hard
to get kidnapped.

38
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,836
-Let's go and catch Cha Do-won.
-Yes, ma'am.

39
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,922
-Stop crying!
-Stopping.

40
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,260
Could you untie me?

41
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,391
Mr. Nam.

42
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,352
You don't seem

43
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,813
to realize what's happening here.

44
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,325
Sorry, you were being serious.

45
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,044
You're killing me.

46
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:17,131
You're the one who doesn't realize
what's happening here.

47
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,552
Now's not the time to threaten me.

48
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:25,473
You should be on your knees
and apologizing, you asshole.

49
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:45,159
I'm such a great actor, aren't I?
You're surprised, aren't you?

50
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,536
That confession you made,

51
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:50,373
about your crimes,
we got it all on camera over there.

52
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,626
-Gosh.
-Are you okay?

53
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,794
His head.

54
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:57,213
I'm fine. I just hate mosquitoes.

55
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,008
Prosecutor Cha.

56
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:02,593
No, Cha Do-won.

57
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,596
Enough is enough.

58
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,975
Just come with us
to the police station quietly.

59
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,167
That wasn't a part of the plan.

60
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,960
Is that a real gun?

61
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:44,677
Yeong-ju.

62
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:49,057
Put the gun down.
We're recording everything right now.

63
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,850
-Don't do anything stupid.
-Shut up.

64
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:52,977
This way, sir.

65
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:02,028
Get rid of Nam Han-jun first.

66
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:06,783
Han-jun.

67
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,465
Over there.

68
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,064
Jae-hui!

69
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,330
-Hey!
-Ma'am!

70
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,262
-Ma'am.
-No, damn it.

71
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,849
I'm fine. You can't let Cha escape.

72
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,267
Go get him.

73
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,603
-Shoot.
-Inspector.

74
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,272
-Sang-hyeop.
-Inspector.

75
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,065
Hurry up and call 911.

76
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,861
Jae-hui, are you okay?

77
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:26,696
I'm fine.

78
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,616
Han-jun.

79
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,503
Don't do anything taxing today.

80
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,141
It's just a light graze,
they say it'll heal in no time.

81
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,434
But it still hurts.

82
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,603
I let Cha Do-won get away

83
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,147
and you got hurt too.

84
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,816
I knew Gu Tae-su was a hunter,

85
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,235
so why didn't I think
of his hunting rifle?

86
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,696
It just makes me so upset.

87
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,199
Mr. Nam.

88
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,951
-Look at me.
-Why?

89
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,496
Do you need something? Does it hurt?

90
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,039
Should I get the doctor again?

91
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,166
I'm in the Major Crimes
Investigation Division.

92
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,169
I know and that's why

93
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,005
I'm trying very hard not to ask you

94
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:29,217
why you put yourself at risk
and why you chased Cha

95
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,177
when the gun was plainly visible.

96
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,179
Even though I want to.

97
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,808
Thank you for understanding.

98
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,312
We have to hurry,
We don't have the time to…

99
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:44,565
Gosh. You can't move yet.

100
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,609
It might be a graze,
but it's still a gunshot wound.

101
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:50,696
I won't ask you to stay at the hospital,
so trust your team and rest for a day.

102
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,158
I do have faith in them.

103
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,952
It's not that I don't trust my team.

104
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,330
It's just that I feel like such an idiot,

105
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,833
which is why I want
to catch him right now.

106
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,839
My brother's killer was right next to me,

107
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,718
and I didn't even know that
and relied on him.

108
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,305
I was such an idiot.
I didn't know he was lying to me,

109
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,392
and I actually felt grateful.

110
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,938
When I think about how much
he must have been laughing at me,

111
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:26,941
it makes me so mad,

112
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,905
and Jae-jeong must have watched
the whole thing.

113
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,200
It makes me feel so bad.

114
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,875
It's not your fault,
so don't torment yourself.

115
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,004
Whatever his intentions were,

116
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,715
he was still there for you
in those hard times.

117
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,426
Of course you feel confused.

118
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,803
It's my fault.

119
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,223
I let you suffer alone.

120
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,184
I'm sorry.

121
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,987
You look pretty when you smile.

122
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,491
But don't ever do that again.

123
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,202
You're so fragile.

124
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,667
You're so pretty.

125
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:31,297
Gosh.

126
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,302
It's okay.

127
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:47,271
Where the heck is he?

128
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,857
Du-jin, I found the white truck.

129
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,233
That's it, 5949.

130
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,777
Yes, that's the one.

131
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,279
Just a second.

132
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,406
Han, how're you feeling?

133
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,867
Is that Inspector Han?
Ma'am, are you okay?

134
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,912
It was only a graze, so I'm fine.

135
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,455
I'm leaving the hospital now.

136
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,540
What happened with Cha Do-won?

137
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,417
We put him on the wanted list,

138
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,378
and we just found
the truck from the tip we got.

139
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,547
Someone reported Cha Do-won's location.

140
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,300
What did they say?

141
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:19,512
They drove a man with an injured leg
to downtown Jakdu-dong.

142
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,807
They got suspicious
when he refused to go to the hospital.

143
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,101
I'm close to Jakdu-dong,
so I'll go check it out.

144
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,228
Send us his last known location.

145
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,396
Okay, he was last seen

146
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,982
at 141-5, Jakdu-dong.
That's where he got off.

147
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,489
He knows he's wanted.
He wouldn't have gone to a big hospital.

148
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,699
Let's search
the smaller clinics and pharmacies.

149
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,205
Has this man been here?

150
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,333
I'm not sure.

151
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,835
He's dangerous,

152
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,795
so if you see him, please call us.

153
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,172
Okay.

154
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,470
The news that a prosecutor

155
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,848
was behind a string of serial murders,

156
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,058
including the recent murder
of a shaman named Ms. Lim,

157
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,102
has sent shockwaves across the country.

158
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:12,440
It's shocking enough that a prosecutor
was actually a serial killer,

159
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,650
but stoking the controversy
even further is

160
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:18,154
the fact that he executed criminals
who had committed heinous crimes,

161
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,823
yet they evaded harsh punishment
and were set free.

162
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,330
Not to mention he's a prosecutor.

163
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,750
A prosecutor seeking personal revenge,
that's just wrong.

164
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,462
He's not a hero,
he's just a crazy psychopath.

165
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:37,173
Personal revenge is against the law.

166
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,758
This is all because
the sentences are so light.

167
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,927
-Hello?
-The law needs to put the victims first,

168
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,180
but it has failed
to keep up with the times.

169
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,892
-that's why these things are happening.
-Still, you can't defend a murderer.

170
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,185
Is anyone here?

171
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:53,731
The door's open.

172
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,274
He must have been here. I'm sure of it.

173
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,379
Look at it from the victims' perspective.

174
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:01,173
But if acts of vigilantism were allowed,

175
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,342
our society would descend
into lawless chaos.

176
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:06,804
-No, what I meant was…
-Okay, that's all we have time for today.

177
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:09,932
We also have our viewers' opinions ready.
Let's take a look.

178
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:13,435
No matter what the situation is,
how can they defend a murderer?

179
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,897
-Is everyone out of their mind?
-But I kind of get it.

180
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,608
Come on, to be honest,
the rich and powerful

181
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,569
don't really get properly punished.

182
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,154
The weight of the crime changes
based on who commits it,

183
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,489
which pisses people off.

184
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,867
Wow, there are way more comments
in support of him.

185
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,745
-There's even a meme of him as a hero.
-I bet Cha Do-won is elated right now.

186
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,707
To put it bluntly,
it's not like he only killed criminals.

187
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,668
But this is more provocative.

188
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:39,628
Damn it.

189
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,255
We have to catch that bastard

190
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,424
before copycat crimes begin.

191
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,516
ENTER PASSWORD

192
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,568
Hey.

193
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,570
We're searching Cha's office,

194
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:07,323
and we found password-encrypted
files on his hard disk drive.

195
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,826
It'll take too long to decrypt them

196
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,703
through the official channels,

197
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:15,039
so I was wondering if Ms. Nam could help.

198
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,624
Of course, we'll be waiting.

199
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,292
Okay, I'll be there soon.

200
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:21,754
-Detective Na.
-Yes.

201
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,380
-Could you carry out this computer?
-Okay.

202
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,840
Please take this.

203
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,308
Jeez.

204
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,604
Han, I think we've got something here.

205
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:39,688
Okay, I'll take a look.

206
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,445
There's something here.

207
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,333
What's this?

208
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,751
JUNG HYE-YOON

209
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,215
It looks like Jung Hye-yoon's diary.

210
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:12,137
EFFECTS OF HYPNOSIS AND MEMORY LOSS

211
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:16,850
Good.

212
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,937
We're going to play
a guessing game with photos.

213
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,855
Now, what does the first photo look like?

214
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:27,653
Now I see why he was so obsessed
with executing criminals.

215
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,409
His father manipulated his memories
and brainwashed him.

216
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:40,582
He made Cha Do-won believe that
it was his brother who was nuts

217
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,167
and brainwashed him into thinking

218
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,628
that evildoers who break the law
must be eliminated.

219
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,256
With psychopaths,
it's more effective to brainwash them

220
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,467
than to teach him what's right and wrong.

221
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:54,972
Then he really must have thought
Cha Seung-won killed Oh Hyeon-u?

222
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,934
He must have realized
something was wrong at the crime scene

223
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,729
and went to see Jung Hye-yoon
who told him the truth.

224
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,691
-He must have murdered her then.
-Wait, so…

225
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,818
Prosecutor Cha is also a victim in a way?

226
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:10,237
Instead of having his memory manipulated,

227
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,905
if he had been properly punished
when he was young,

228
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,366
he might not have become a serial killer.

229
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:16,368
Maybe.

230
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,591
This sound.

231
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,052
I heard it at the crime scene
where Jae-jeong died.

232
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,511
Then maybe…

233
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,224
I found this in Prosecutor Cha's office.

234
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:42,644
Wait.

235
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,314
So Jung Hye-yoon
told him to use that thing

236
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,274
to restrain his urge to kill,

237
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:50,611
but Prosecutor Cha used it to calm
himself down after killing people instead?

238
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:55,199
Before he killed Jae-jeong, he must have
used the clicker to control his urges

239
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,743
and told Gu Tae-su
to carry out the murders.

240
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:00,245
But he broke the rule
after killing Jae-jeong himself.

241
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,207
He probably won't be able
to satisfy himself vicariously anymore

242
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,500
after being exposed to murder…

243
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,713
We need to hurry and catch him
before he kills again.

244
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,633
He's going to kill more people
instead of running away?

245
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:15,177
He'll either show his true self
and run rampant

246
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,514
or kill again in order to prove
that he's a man of principle

247
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,058
and not some crazy murderer.

248
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,851
Either way, he won't be able

249
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,603
to stop himself from killing again.

250
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,952
HARDWARE STORE

251
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,832
Can I help you find anything?

252
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:05,394
Wait, he went missing
after he was acquitted?

253
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,229
Who went missing exactly?

254
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:10,607
Okay. You saw him
at a convenience store in Chinatown?

255
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,442
Okay.

256
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,695
Hello, this is Division Seven.

257
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,363
I'm on Sinmyeong Electronics
Market's second store

258
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:19,116
-Yes.
-He bought a ship ticket?

259
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,243
Wait, but isn't it weird

260
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,245
that he's going to Jeju-do and not trying

261
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,622
to smuggle himself somewhere far away?

262
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,877
Cha Do-won was seen at the Sinmyeong
Electronics Market five minutes ago.

263
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,629
Sinmyeong Electronics Market…

264
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,089
-Ma'am.
-Sinmyeong…

265
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,216
Look.

266
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,220
What?

267
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:45,225
He's going all sorts of places
when there's an APB out on him.

268
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,144
Isn't he being way too careless?

269
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:50,689
It's like he has a plan.

270
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,691
I decrypted the files!

271
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:56,278
The names written on the Gopuri fabric
in those pictures on Gu Tae-su's laptop

272
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,906
and the people in Cha Do-won's files
are the same.

273
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,325
So it'll prove that Cha Do-won made

274
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,202
the list of people to execute.

275
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:07,915
So this is like a "Death-Note."

276
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,959
But we have a lot of new names here too.

277
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,086
They could be his next target.

278
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,296
What?

279
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,257
Find out who they are.

280
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,009
Okay.

281
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,136
-What?
-Yes.

282
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,268
Hi. Did you find where Cha Do-won is?

283
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:31,939
Yes, but he's been spotted
in multiple places.

284
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:32,898
What do you mean?

285
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,984
He's been spotted all around Sinmyeong.

286
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:39,363
At a shop in Chinatown,
the passenger terminal,

287
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:40,948
and the Sinmyeong Electronics Market.

288
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:44,034
We've confirmed he's been
to those three places.

289
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,747
I'm sure he has a plan…

290
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,751
That window just now.

291
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,506
Show me the addresses
of people on the list again.

292
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,840
Okay.

293
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,177
The addresses of people on this list

294
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,763
and the places Cha Do-won
has been seen in are the same.

295
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:07,683
We found a list of people to be executed
on his flash drive.

296
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,894
I think he's chasing after the people
on that list to kill them

297
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,021
There are three people left. Woo Am-cheol,

298
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,315
Cho Bok-cheon, and Oh Sin-pyeong.

299
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,775
I'll send you the file now.

300
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,323
Oh Sin-pyeong?

301
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,909
That's the name of the guy who called

302
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,828
-saying he saw Cha Do-won.
-What?

303
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:29,830
Yes, Cho Bok-cheon has a truck

304
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,499
that he uses to transport marine products.

305
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:36,920
Then Cho Bok-cheon must be
at the passenger terminal.

306
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:41,174
This means he has no intention
of stopping his murder spree.

307
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,260
And it also means that we'd have
a chance at catching him

308
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:45,220
if we keep an eye on those three.

309
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,097
We don't know who's next,

310
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,974
so let's split up the places
and start looking.

311
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,977
Sinmyeong Electronics Market is close by,
so we'll go there.

312
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,604
Okay, we'll leave right away too.

313
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,150
-Let's go get that bastard, Cha Do-won.
-Let's go.

314
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,235
-Okay.
-Okay.

315
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,154
Let's go.

316
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:28,096
DAEUN POLICE STATION

317
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:31,516
Woo Am-cheol, real name Lin Cheng.

318
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,018
He's a smuggler and killer.

319
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:36,229
He's a Chinese citizen and he escaped
while being repatriated.

320
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:39,274
He must have snuck back in
despite being barred from reentry.

321
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:40,275
Damn it.

322
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,865
His name is Cho Bok-cheon.

323
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:50,619
He's 37 years old
and was charged with child abuse.

324
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:55,582
He picked out real garbage.

325
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:58,835
Let's just focus on stopping him

326
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,171
before there are any more victims.

327
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:11,473
ASSAILANT INFORMATION
OH SIN-PYEONG

328
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:14,059
Wow, what a crazy scumbag.

329
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:17,312
-What?
-His girlfriend broke up with him,

330
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:19,272
so he stalked, blackmailed,

331
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,899
kidnapped, then threatened to kill her.

332
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,153
She was so stressed
that she tried to take her own life,

333
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,823
-and do you know what this scumbag said?
-What did he say?

334
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,616
"It's not a crime to love."

335
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:32,869
-That fucking…
-Goddamn son of a bitch.

336
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,913
So where is that son of a bitch right now?

337
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:38,291
The son of a bitch is still at
Sinmyeong Electronics Market.

338
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,085
Let's hurry there before he moves.

339
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,169
Yes, okay.

340
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,299
-Gwang-tae.
-Yes.

341
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,301
Start from here and comb the place.

342
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:54,599
Sorry.

343
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:01,523
Gwang-tae.

344
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:04,359
That's Cha Do-won, right?

345
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:06,695
It is. That's him.

346
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:10,740
Cha Do-won.

347
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,826
Cha Do-won.

348
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,452
Excuse me. Sorry.

349
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,454
-Sorry.
-Excuse me.

350
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,958
Sorry.

351
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,252
-Excuse me.
-Damn it.

352
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,088
Where did he go?

353
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,632
Hurry up and find him.

354
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,509
Cha Do-won.

355
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,304
-Goodness, what the hell?
-Sorry.

356
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,181
-Who are you?
-I'm sorry.

357
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,935
Over there. Cha Do-won, you scumbag.

358
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,103
-Hey!
-Cha Do-won!

359
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:43,648
How is he so fast?

360
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,400
Hey, Cha Do-won.

361
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,112
What do you want?

362
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,161
I'm sorry.

363
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:58,330
We thought you were someone else.

364
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:01,374
-Who are you?
-When did we get them switched?

365
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,176
-We're screwed.
-We're screwed.

366
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,574
Mr. Oh.

367
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,159
I'm almost there.

368
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,079
Don't answer your phone.
It's for your own protection.

369
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,789
Hide in that place you told me about.

370
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,632
He still isn't picking up.

371
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:55,637
I'll go to the shop with Su-cheol.
Call me once you hack into the CCTV feed.

372
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,097
Okay.

373
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:05,397
-That's the wrong way. It's this way.
-Okay.

374
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,445
Shoot. The fucking network.

375
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:15,365
Damn it, why is the signal gone again?

376
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,492
Maybe it's because the building's old.

377
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:19,327
So you can't hack into the CCTV feed?

378
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,371
We'll have to go in
and connect to it manually.

379
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,354
-Mr. Jang.
-Yes?

380
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,480
Over there.

Hello, we're from TK.

-You're here early.
-It's time for the routine inspection.

385
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:08,752
Routine inspection?
I thought you were here to fix things.

386
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,713
Of course we are.

387
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:16,134
We inspect things and fix things too.
You know how it is.

388
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,844
Come on in.

Why are they all like that?

393
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,780
What's wrong with them?

394
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,869
Turn the modem off and back on.

395
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,704
The LAN cables and the modem
are all tangled.

396
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,499
The janitor doesn't know
which is the modem for the CCTVs.

397
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:49,876
Hurry and find it
before Nam Han-jun pitches a fit.

398
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,869
Someone cut the LAN cable.

399
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,915
I think we have to reconnect it.

400
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,501
Who could have done this?

401
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,462
Do you have any spare LAN cables?

402
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:37,173
Hye-jun?

403
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,433
I'll go and get the cable.

404
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,976
-Could you wait here?
-Okay.

405
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:57,402
Boss, someone cut the internet cable here.

406
00:28:57,485 --> 00:29:00,363
Hye-jun's not responding,
so I'm going up to her right now.

407
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,700
Na-dan, what did you say?

408
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:05,285
I can't hear you.

409
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:07,620
Did something happen?

410
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:23,803
Shoot.

411
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,098
This is building B, 15, 1st floor,
We're at the right place.

412
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,517
So where did he go
with the doors still open?

413
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,270
Damn it, why isn't he picking up?

414
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:35,148
-I'll go, you…
-No.

415
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:38,526
I'll go find them, you stay here
and wait for Oh Sin-pyeong.

416
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,652
Okay.

417
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,821
-Call me right away if anything happens.
-Okay.

418
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,702
He was so scared
he asked for police protection,

419
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,329
so where could he have gone?

420
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,006
Mr. Oh.

421
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,178
Mr. Oh, this is the police.

422
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,889
You asked for police protection, right?

423
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,434
Mr. Oh.

424
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,314
What took you so long?

425
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:20,401
I thought you were that crazy
prosecutor and was so scared.

426
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:34,999
Please don't kill me.

427
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:42,924
Come on.

428
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,093
Damn it.

429
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,763
Come on, where are they?

430
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:52,767
Jeez.

00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:05,363
-something's off here.
-Where are you?

434
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:08,116
I'm at the hardware store,

435
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,493
I think I should go in and check.

436
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,372
Mr. Oh.

437
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:15,832
Mr. Oh, are you okay?

438
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:18,084
Wake up. Who did this to you?

439
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:20,753
The prosecutor. He…

440
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:24,757
What? Prosecutor? Prosecutor Cha?

441
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,346
What are you doing, you bastard?
Unlock this right now.

442
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:34,434
-What? What happened?
-Are you kidding me?

443
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,979
Prosecutor Cha
stabbed Oh Sin-pyeong and ran.

444
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:42,358
What about Oh Sin-pyeong?
Is he okay? What about Prosecutor Cha?

445
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,152
I think he locked me in here

446
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,237
to go after you, so be careful.

447
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:49,032
I'll get there as fast as I can.

449
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:05,048
Hey.

450
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,842
What did you do to those kids?

451
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,347
I didn't kill them.

452
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,600
They're all fine, so don't worry.

453
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:16,976
My target has always been…

454
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,063
you, Mr. Nam Han-jun.

455
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,043
It's so quiet in there.

456
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:44,128
-Let's go in on the count of three.
-Yes, okay.

457
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:48,675
One, two, three.

458
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,846
You're getting ready to open the shop.

459
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,099
Mr. Woo, we're the police.

460
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:59,310
We're not here on a bust,
we just want to check something.

461
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,525
Come on, damn it.

462
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:07,860
-The damn police. Come here.
-Come on.

463
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:13,157
I found Cha Do-won.
He's at Sinmyeong Electronics Market.

464
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,326
Mr. Shaman, I'm sorry.

465
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,829
I don't think we'll make it.

466
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,571
Wow.

467
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,534
Wow, this actually works.

468
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,456
So you found the video.

469
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:08,004
But you don't really think I still
respond to that stupid clicker, do you?

470
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:11,132
That's what I'm saying.

471
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:14,135
You're not a kid
who responds to this stuff,

472
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,888
but I almost felt bad for you.

473
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,765
Jeez, I was watching the video,

474
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,516
and it was so sad.

475
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:25,980
It made me wonder
if I should free you from

476
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,483
that damn brainwashing.

477
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,236
"Brainwashing"?

478
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:38,868
So even you call my acts of judgment
a product of brainwashing?

479
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:43,915
A delusional monster who believes
himself to be the judge of humankind.

480
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,335
That's you.

481
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:50,671
Goddamn it, you're so pathetic.

482
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,761
My father looked at me like that too.

483
00:34:56,844 --> 00:35:00,014
But he was the one
who actually broke the law.

484
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,018
He let me escape the law
when I killed a person.

485
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:07,396
So don't pretend like
you're so righteous with me.

486
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,650
You're just another hypocritical coward.

487
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,319
Why?

488
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:15,279
Do you think you wouldn't have

489
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:18,366
become the monster you are now
if you'd been scolded as a child?

490
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,536
Stop pretending to be a freaking victim.

491
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:28,251
You know the real reason
you're wallowing in self-pity?

492
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,963
It's because you're going
to break down once you admit

493
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:35,633
you've been killing people for fun,
you asshole.

494
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,136
You know it just as well as I do.

495
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:41,848
You're just a crazy psychopath.

496
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:53,484
Come now.
Why don't you just admit it already?

497
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:56,362
You're just a lowlife murderer.

498
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,741
You're not some righteous grand judge
that you think you are.

499
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:02,535
All right.

500
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:05,079
I'm going to kill you today.

501
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,998
You know, I'm usually a pacifist.

502
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:10,751
But as someone older and wiser.
I'll teach you a lesson today.

503
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,337
Come at me, punk.

504
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:28,853
You don't know who I am, do you?

505
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:32,481
I'm Jang Du-jin, you punk.

506
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,863
-Hey.
-Hey, let go of me.

507
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:19,779
You know what?

508
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:21,948
People need me.

509
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:25,409
They don't want to get blood on their
hands, yet they despise criminals

510
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,161
walking freely among them.

511
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,748
You might think what I do is a crime,

512
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:32,792
but to me, it's justice.

513
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:34,877
Jeez, you crazy bastard.

514
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:37,672
You really think you're
doing society a favor?

515
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:45,346
Damn it.

516
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,809
I almost have it.

517
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:08,160
I've enjoyed myself for quite a while,
thanks to you.

518
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,412
I even got to understand

519
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:14,041
what people mean
when they talk about friends.

520
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:17,878
I thought I turned you down.

521
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:21,215
I told you then that you'd die if you did.

522
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:23,634
It's too bad.

523
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:29,015
You'll die without having seen
how my judgments change the world.

524
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:44,655
You think you're so freaking clever,
don't you?

525
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,198
But you're not.

526
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:49,368
You're just lucky.

527
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:52,246
I was always a step ahead of you,

528
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,416
I could've killed you like Han Jae-jeong,
but I let you live.

529
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,252
You crazy bastard…

530
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,798
-Let go of me.
-Stay still.

531
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,091
We got him.

532
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:09,889
-You don't have handcuffs?
-No.

533
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:11,057
I don't, either.

534
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,142
Good, you're here.

535
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:16,729
We're in a hurry,
could you arrest the whole lot?

536
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:19,357
Enough of this bullshit.

537
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:42,713
I'm not lucky.

538
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:46,550
I'm talented. You didn't let me live.

539
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,844
I caught you.

540
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,391
And

541
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:55,351
Jae-jeong.

542
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,523
Don't say his name
with that filthy mouth of yours.

543
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,859
Han Jae-jeong?

544
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:07,571
Did I tell you?

545
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:10,741
That Han Jae-jeong begged me
before he died?

546
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:15,579
He groveled and begged me not to kill him.

547
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,774
I have to save them.

548
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:48,237
I stopped the bleeding,
so please take care of the rest.

549
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,697
-Okay.
-Yes.

550
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,906
Hye-jun!

551
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,618
Na-dan! Han-jun!

552
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:06,005
What? You can't kill me?

553
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:09,675
Are you afraid you'll be riddled
with guilt all your life? Or…

554
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:13,429
Are you afraid to find out
that you're no different from me?

555
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,556
What is it?

556
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:50,382
So you're scared to die?

557
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:52,551
Damn it.

558
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,428
You piece of trash…

559
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:57,973
I spent six years chasing you.

560
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:04,605
Do you know how I'm different from you?

561
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:08,275
I don't think I embody justice.
So I'm not going to kill you.

562
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:11,111
I'm going to hand you over to the police.

563
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:14,782
Who are you to execute people?

564
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:18,369
Who are you to believe
that you're on the side of justice?

565
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:34,009
It's because you're crazy. Damn it.

566
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:36,512
It's because you're crazy.

567
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:42,768
Na-dan!

568
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,564
Na-dan, are you okay?

569
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:49,567
-Na-dan.
-Shoot.

570
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,485
Hye-jun! Na-dan!

571
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:52,736
Su-cheol!

572
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:58,617
Oh, god. I was so worried.

573
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:01,036
I was almost scared to death.

574
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,831
I thought I was really going to die.

575
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,504
But where's Han-jun?

576
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:13,340
Where is he?

577
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,511
-Shoot.
-Shoot.

578
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:21,557
Mr. Nam.

579
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:32,526
Shoot.

580
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,617
Cha Do-won, you're under arrest

581
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,244
for the murder
and the solicitation of murder

582
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,830
of Han Jae-jeong, Jung Hye-yoon,
and Im Hui-suk.

583
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:47,082
You have the right to remain silent
and the right to an attorney.

584
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:50,127
You will also be given a chance
to explain yourself,

585
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,963
but this is the end for you,
you goddamn son of a bitch.

586
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:59,845
Wow. He beat me to a pulp,
but you knocked him out with a kick.

587
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:07,603
-What made you start executing criminals?
-Anything to say to the victims?

588
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:09,521
Some people are praising you as a hero,

589
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:11,273
how do you feel
now that you've been caught?

590
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:12,816
He's not a hero,

591
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,405
he's just a goddamn serial killer.

592
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,997
Yes, make way.

593
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:30,626
What was your secret
in catching the culprit?

594
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,920
How did you know where he was?
Did you get a tip-off?

595
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,506
I just used my abilities.

596
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:37,591
I deduced what the criminal was thinking

597
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:40,469
and analyzed the pattern
of their crimes as a criminal profiler.

598
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:42,805
Han-jun.

599
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:44,890
-Han-jun.
-Han-jun.

600
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:47,393
How did you know the killer's next target?

601
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:50,020
-Oh, well…
-The spirits told him.

602
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:52,106
-The spirits?
-No, it's not that…

603
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:55,734
This is the famed shaman of Yonghae-dong.
The shaman supreme, Mr. Shaman.

604
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:58,028
This is so embarrassing.

605
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:00,114
Guys, can we talk?

606
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,199
So he exposed the ugly truth of Cha Do-won

607
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:05,327
using his strong ties with the spirits.

608
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,496
You know the Jakdu-dong
land development project, right?

609
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:09,623
Mr. Shaman uncovered the truth
about that too.

610
00:45:09,706 --> 00:45:12,835
He's at Café Minamdang, 150 Yonghae-dong.

611
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:15,421
-Call us anytime.
-That's right.

612
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:18,590
Hurry up and smile. You still have
a big loan to pay off, you idiot.

613
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:28,934
I'm Shaman Nam Han-jun,
the wonder of Yonghae-dong.

614
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:30,477
Yes, he's a great shaman.

615
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:33,814
When is your connection to the spirits
the strongest?

616
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,232
It comes at all hours.

617
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:45,409
A WEEK LATER

618
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,209
Jeez.

619
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,129
I don't know if I should be doing this,

620
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,925
but I thought you might regret it later.

621
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:09,016
Your mother's here.

622
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:22,738
Yeong-ju.

623
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:28,327
It's Mom.

624
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:32,122
Why are you in there?

625
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,500
Honey.

626
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,502
You shouldn't be in there.

627
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,546
I'm sorry.

628
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:42,424
I'm so sorry,

629
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:44,885
my baby.

630
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:51,475
Yeong-ju.

631
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:07,991
I guess this is the end for us.

632
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,414
I wish you the best, Jae-hui.

633
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:17,417
I don't wish you the best.

634
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:22,464
I'll pray that every moment of your life
feels like hell.

635
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:30,597
I like that better than some nonsense like

636
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:34,017
"I've forgiven you for everything,
you should repent too."

637
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:38,897
You think it's nonsense to tell you
to repent for your crimes?

638
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:43,944
Didn't I tell you

639
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:49,032
that I only executed those
who deserved to be punished?

640
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,578
My brother didn't do anything wrong.

641
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:56,582
Shouldn't you at least admit
that you were wrong to kill my brother

642
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:59,459
and feel some regret or guilt about it?

643
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:04,548
To be honest, I never regretted it.

644
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:09,636
I did feel a bit guilty,
but not about Prosecutor Han,

645
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:11,847
about you.

646
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:18,353
Seeing you think that it was
your fault that your brother died,

647
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:21,148
I did feel kind of bad.

648
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:25,569
Within our relationship,
Han Jae-jeong was the bond

649
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:29,031
that linked us.

650
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:32,326
That's why I liked you.

651
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,995
You know it too. Wasn't that why

652
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:38,624
you saved me even though
you got hurt in the process?

653
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,126
I saved you because

654
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:45,756
I'm a police officer,
not because I felt a bond between us.

655
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:47,716
You felt guilty?

656
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,509
You liked me?

657
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:52,638
You were just watching my pain

658
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:56,141
and reliving the thrill you felt
when you killed.

659
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:04,941
That could be true.

660
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:10,197
Still, I was being sincere

661
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:15,744
when I told you I liked you.

662
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:28,924
-"Sincere"?
-Yes.

663
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:34,179
You want to know what I sincerely regret?

664
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:40,602
If I'd recognized the devil in you
a little earlier,

665
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:45,524
I could have saved
some of the people you killed. That's it.

666
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:50,612
I'll live with that guilt forever.

667
00:49:58,870 --> 00:49:59,746
Okay.

668
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,874
You keep on living like
the beast that you are.

669
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:08,255
While I'll catch killers like you,
who are ordinary-looking

670
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:11,133
and hiding among us, even faster.

671
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:30,068
CAFÉ MINAMDANG

672
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:33,029
-Take a picture of me.
-When will he come out?

673
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:36,116
-Hurry.
-It's my turn.

674
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,618
-Take a picture of me.
-Oh, my.

675
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,537
Come on.

676
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,080
Make sure my legs look long.

677
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:44,082
Hurry up, it's my turn.

678
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:46,293
We haven't paid off the loan yet,

679
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:48,211
and we lost a huge amount of money

680
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:51,006
while going after Prosecutor Cha.

681
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:52,841
But you want to take six months off?

682
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:53,967
I told you.

683
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:57,304
I need to find a way
to increase my happiness level.

684
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:59,306
Take care of Minamdang while I'm gone.

685
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:04,269
-You're really going to take time off?
-Jeez, stop acting cute.

686
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:08,273
If you stop me, I'm going to go
straight into retirement. Move.

687
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:15,030
Fine, we're going to do
just fine without you,

688
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:18,283
you better not regret this when you
find out you're not needed anymore.

689
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:21,328
Goodbye, everyone.

690
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,997
I'm going to shed
all worldly restraints and fetters

691
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,540
to go seek my happiness.

692
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:28,084
I hope you will all find happiness too.

00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:45,143
-Mr. Shaman.
-What is it?

700
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:46,645
Quiet.

701
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:47,562
What is it?

702
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:50,440
Where are you? There's something
I want to discuss with you.

703
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:53,568
Hey, please be careful. Come on.

704
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,237
GOOD COFFEE, HANDSOME SHAMAN

705
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,322
Don't worry about it and have the baby.

706
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:58,698
What?

707
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:01,576
Mr. Shaman, I do want to have the baby,

708
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,078
but now's not a good time.

709
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:05,247
You know I'm this close to
becoming the chairman.

710
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:06,706
It's good to have a goal.

711
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,584
But achieving it will only make you
happy for a short time.

712
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:12,796
Do you think it'll make you happy
to have the baby? Then have it.

713
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:15,090
Okay, consultation over.

714
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:16,758
What should its nickname be?

715
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:20,011
Call him "Minam" as in "Minamdang."

716
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:23,056
-Okay.
-That's good.

717
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:26,768
I'll be gone for a while, so don't look
for me or come to Minamdang.

718
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:28,770
Mr. Shaman, where are you going?

719
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:30,814
You heard? I won't be back.

720
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:33,900
-No!
-Don't go.

721
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,162
GRUMPY

722
00:52:47,163 --> 00:52:50,250
Damn it, that moron.
Hey, punk, stop right there.

723
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:57,382
Jae-hui. I'll be on a holiday for a while.
Let's go on a date.

724
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,260
I'm busy right now,
I'll call you back later.

725
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:01,928
Tell me when you get off work,

726
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,389
-I'll go pick…
-Stop right there!

727
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:06,141
-Jae-hui?
-I said, stop! You idiot!

728
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:24,618
Kim Gi-yeong.

729
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:28,997
You're under arrest for your involvement
in a voice phishing crime organization.

730
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:32,626
If you come any closer,
I'll kill you. Got it?

731
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:35,503
Come on, put the knife away.

732
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:37,047
That's dangerous.

733
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,218
Jeez, come on.

734
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:49,142
Can you hurry up?

735
00:53:49,225 --> 00:53:50,477
Long time no see.

736
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:56,608
Wow, you're sweating so much.

737
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:59,402
How have you been?
Shall we have a chat on our way?

738
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:00,570
Shoot.

739
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,408
May the law save you.

740
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:06,785
And may divine…

741
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:11,122
-Never mind. Just stay where you are.
-That's right. Good job.

742
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:16,127
I heard you caught the leader
of the voice phishing organization.

743
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:24,302
Major Crimes Investigation Division Seven,
good job. Well done.

744
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:26,096
-Nice.
-Nice.

745
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:29,432
Wow, we used to be
the dunce division, right?

746
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:32,560
No, you're not the dunce division.

747
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:35,605
Turns out you were the lucky seven.

748
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:37,148
The lucky seven!

749
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:39,359
What do you want to eat?

750
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:41,611
Let's have a team dinner, okay?

751
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:48,535
Get lost.

752
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,623
What do we have here?
Let's take a look. What is this?

753
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,333
DAEUN POLICE COSTS OF INVESTIGATION

754
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:59,421
The gang members' hospital bill is
ten… No, hundred, thousand…

755
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:03,216
-Ten million won?
-They deserved the beating.

756
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:06,302
My god. I can't take this.

757
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:08,179
As of today, you are all

758
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:13,935
taking a holiday.

759
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,854
-Yes.
-Great.

760
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:19,607
No! We don't even have
all the gang members in custody yet!

761
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:22,902
Please, don't do anything
and just rest. Okay?

762
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,405
At this rate you'll end up

763
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:29,117
sealing our doom.

764
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,326
A compulsory holiday?

765
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:32,328
Great, we can go on a trip together.

766
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:39,085
This is nice. I can't remember
the last time we were this relaxed.

767
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:41,171
Isn't this place so nice and peaceful?

768
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:45,008
It's nice. It really is…

769
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:51,723
But are you sure you don't have
to go to Minamdang to work?

770
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:53,391
I am.

771
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:57,020
I'm more worried that they won't
take me back when I return.

772
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:04,277
By the way,
I love how you've dressed up today.

773
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:07,405
I made an effort
since we were going on a date.

774
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:10,200
No!

775
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:13,912
This trio won't work. We're going
to go out of business at this rate.

776
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:18,083
Gosh, we're so busy,
so why are our sales down?

777
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:19,125
You really have to ask?

778
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:22,295
We have no boss, no barista,
and also a bad reputatio with moms

779
00:56:22,378 --> 00:56:24,798
thanks to a certain someone.

780
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:28,176
Hey, how is that my fault?
It's because of that ridiculous woman.

781
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:30,053
So, what you're saying is

782
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:34,015
that you want me to make your daughter
the top student at her school?

783
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:37,602
Yes. Write me a talisman that will make
the other students mess up the tests.

784
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:41,689
Or this belongs
to the current top student,

785
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:43,191
you could…

786
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:44,442
Are you kidding me?

787
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:47,362
Lady, your daughter's grades
aren't the problem here!

788
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:50,365
-Why are you hitting me?
-What will your child learn from you?

789
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:53,284
She's not the problem in this family,
you are.

790
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:55,578
-Get out of here right now. Get out!
-Oh, goodness.

791
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:59,374
I can't believe she wrote about it online
instead of reflecting on herself.

792
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:06,172
This is all
because I had to step in for you.

793
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,716
Oh, well…

794
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,094
Come on, they kept tugging
at my heartstrings,

795
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:12,554
what was I supposed to do?

796
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:13,513
Jeez.

797
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:20,311
Oh, gosh.

798
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:35,743
I can't fix your adorable grandson's leg,

799
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:37,996
but you have to live
a long and healthy life

800
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:40,748
for your grandson here.

801
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:42,083
Stay strong.

802
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,555
That old woman's a crook.

803
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:57,348
She owns two buildings.

804
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:59,476
She really didn't look like one.

805
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:00,852
How could anyone do that?

806
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:07,692
I miss the boss.

807
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:10,862
This combination is all wrong.

808
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:14,699
Yes, I think I'd rather have
Han-jun nag me too.

809
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:16,659
But there's nothing we can do.

810
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:17,952
We talked up a big game,

811
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:20,538
we can't beg him to come back faster…

812
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,210
-Careful with the steps.
-Okay.

813
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,341
NA-DAN

814
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:39,891
It's nice to relax
and spend time together,

815
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:41,726
but I actually liked

816
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:46,105
running around with you
to catch the killer too.

817
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:50,568
After all that time of misunderstanding
and agonizing over things on my own

818
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:53,446
and having such a hard time
with the investigation,

819
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,907
working with you felt like…

820
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:57,575
It wasn't easy,

821
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:00,119
but I could enjoy the process.

822
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:04,999
Not because we caught the killer,

823
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:09,837
but I was able to be with you,

824
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:14,509
the people at Minamdang, and my team.

825
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:17,136
That's what made me happy.

826
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:26,479
Why are you looking at me like that?

827
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:32,944
I'm so happy that this wonderful woman
is my girlfriend.

828
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:55,383
I'm a police officer. What's wrong?

829
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,761
There…

830
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:13,234
Look at that sign.
It looks like it was marked after death.

831
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,740
The body found at the reservoir
five years ago was the same.

832
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:22,493
It's stereotypical of
what self-aggrandizing psychopahts do.

833
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:24,162
Leave this to us. You should go.

834
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:26,039
Thank you.

835
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:33,588
Could this be the same killer?

836
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:35,632
He hadn't been in a relationship,

837
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:38,509
was sexually impotent,
and was likely single.

838
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:39,886
That's what we thought then…

839
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:44,766
Wait. I'm on a holiday.

840
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,936
Oh, right. We're on a holiday.

841
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,939
Right, we can call the police about this,

842
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:54,192
and Mr. Jang, too.

843
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:55,693
Let's go.

844
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:57,236
Yes, right.

845
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:00,031
-You can depend on Detective Jang.
-Of course.

846
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:02,492
-The police will take care of it.
-Right.

847
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:11,042
Let's catch him.

848
01:01:12,251 --> 01:01:13,294
Of course we will.

849
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,011
Yes, Mr. Jo.

850
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:25,306
I'll put him on the phone.

851
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:30,520
-Yes, I was just…
-Come back, Han-jun.

852
01:01:30,603 --> 01:01:33,690
Yes, nothing's going right without you.

853
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:37,026
Even though you pile work on us,
it's way better when you're here.

854
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:38,361
Boss!

855
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:42,407
You idiots, unbelievable,
I can't even have a moment to relax.

856
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:49,706
-Han-jun.
-Han-jun.

857
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:51,290
Boss.

858
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:53,126
-Nam Han-jun.
-No.

859
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:56,170
-We don't have time for this.
-There's a serial killer.

860
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:58,172
We need to find
where he left the body first.

861
01:01:58,256 --> 01:01:59,590
Yes.

862
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:07,014
What was the condition of the wrist?

863
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:09,809
It looked like it had been decomposing
for about three days.

864
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:11,477
Then I'll go 15 days back.

865
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:14,647
What about the fingerprints?
Do we know who the victim is?

866
01:02:16,357 --> 01:02:17,358
Found it.

867
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:19,360
Here.

868
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:23,573
MINAMDANG

869
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:27,368
GOING TO JIRISAN TO PRAY

870
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:38,564
