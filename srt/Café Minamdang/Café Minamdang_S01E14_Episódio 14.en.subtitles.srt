EPISODE 14

2
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,335
Kang Eun-hye is here right now.

3
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:50,592
You're so pretty.

4
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:55,138
That's the signal.

5
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,348
He always hogs the cool stuff,

6
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:59,350
and we just clean up after him.

7
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:03,354
I'll go take care of that guy in a jiffy.
So just wait here for a bit.

8
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,356
-Don't get hurt.
-Okay.

9
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,073
The gods of heaven and earth!

10
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:17,827
Help me hear the voices
of the wrongfully murdered.

11
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,039
Guide them to me.

12
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:27,587
Kang Eun-hye says

13
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,341
she knows you feel guilty about her.

14
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:34,928
She says you should stop your evil deeds

15
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,055
and to pay for your crimes.

16
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:41,434
That's how you can truly
repent for what you did to her.

17
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:51,986
Director.

18
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,323
Please, stop.

19
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:03,331
Please stop here, Director.

20
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,753
Director. I can't do this anymore.

21
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,061
Eun-hye.

22
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,149
I'm doing this to end it all.

23
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,068
So you

24
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,112
and I

25
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,531
can all be free together.

26
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:42,996
Ending everything here isn't the way
to set Kang Eun-hye truly free.

27
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,251
It's to punish the one who killed her.

28
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,371
Director.

29
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,082
Come on…

30
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:46,059
He's so cute.

31
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:47,644
Damn it.

32
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,172
Damn, that's hot.

33
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,342
-What's wrong?
-You little…

34
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,510
What?

35
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,262
-Nice job.
-Okay.

36
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,556
That hurts.

37
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,861
Why do you keep getting hurt?

38
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,864
Father.

39
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,534
-Father, are you okay?
-Jin-sang.

40
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,914
He just escaped from captivity.
Do you have to cuff him?

41
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,417
He's being arrested for drug trafficking.

42
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,501
My god, drugs.

43
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:54,669
Jin-sang.

44
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,671
-My herniated disc…
-Disc?

45
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,840
-We need to go to the hospital first.
-Gosh.

46
00:04:58,923 --> 00:04:59,924
Jeez.

47
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,719
I saved you when you were meant to die,

48
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,846
and there you go
shortening your life again.

49
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:07,181
The spirits saved you, you ingrate,

50
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:10,685
but if you throw their kindness away
and continue to sin,

51
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,354
you will soon meet your end.

52
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,731
No, Mr. Shaman.

53
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:15,898
-Father.
-What?

54
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,608
You need to pay for your crimes.

55
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,610
I'll take care of you when you're in jail.

56
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,988
This is the last chance
the spirits are giving you,

57
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:24,615
so confess to everything
and beg for forgiveness.

58
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:28,036
If you don't, you'll be bleeding
from your ass for the rest of your life.

59
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,038
Drip, drip, drip.

60
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,706
Let's go. Come on.

61
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,416
Father.

62
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,542
Gosh.

63
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,254
This way.

64
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,550
Gu Tae-su and Uncle have been arrested?
Didn't you say you'd take care of it?

65
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,886
I'm sorry.

66
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,805
But Chairman Park owns
the biggest portion of the project,

67
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,348
so he won't talk so easily.

68
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,060
You think he's going to stay silent

69
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,520
when the Jakdu-dong project
goes off the rails?

70
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,523
Do you think he'll continue to play dumb?

71
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:01,152
I'll take care of it on my end
so there won't be any trouble.

72
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:03,529
I'm going to hold you to those words.

73
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,698
If I take care of this my way,

74
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,118
you won't escape unscathed either.

75
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:44,070
I'll be back
on the next attorney visiting day.

76
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,240
Goodbye.

77
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,216
Did he say you should tell me

78
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,885
to keep my mouth shut
until the apartments are all sold?

79
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:12,431
You're the one who'll lose the most money
if this project goes bust, sir.

80
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,813
Tell Mr. Cha this.

81
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,356
He's never going to become

82
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,193
the president of Choekang Company
until he gets me out of here.

83
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:28,656
If you leave me like this,
Mr. Cha and you are both over.

84
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:29,824
I know, right?

85
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,910
So why did you keep a ledger on me?

86
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,036
What?

87
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,964
The ledger…

88
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:50,845
Mr. Cha tried to kill you
over something as little as that report.

89
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:54,015
What do you think he'd do if you derail
the project his succession depends on?

90
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:56,559
-Help.
-You don't need me to tell

91
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,519
your fortune to know
what's going to happen.

92
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,104
The antidote.

93
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,650
A wonderful leader who took
his life to take responsibility

94
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,195
for the cancellation of the Jakdu-dong
development project.

95
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,954
Unless that's how
you want your life to end,

96
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,248
you should keep quiet in here.

97
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:25,546
The day you open your mouth will be
the day you'll bring about your own death.

98
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:44,106
It looks legitimate at first,

99
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:48,819
but the relationship between the developer
and the construction company is suspect.

100
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:52,156
Rumors say the Jakdu-dong land
that The Shovel of Sinmyeong purchased

101
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,201
is actually owned by Cha Seung-won,
the CEO of Choekang.

102
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,870
So the cartel invested all the money
they made selling drugs

103
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,705
into this, right?

104
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,916
This seems off.

105
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:05,628
And Park Dong-gi is still invoking
his right to silence.

106
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,631
We should find those who sold the land
to The Shovel of Sinmyeong

107
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,174
and ask them one by one.

108
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,300
Those shameless scumbags.

109
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,636
Guys.

110
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,930
-Look at this.
-Sinmyeong never gained prominence

111
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,099
because it didn't have a downtown

112
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,101
that it could center itself around.

113
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,354
This year, we will make that central city,

114
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,815
which is going to propel
Sinmyeong's development.

115
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,694
Developing Jakdu-dong will propel
the balanced development of Sinmyeong,

116
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,070
help increase its population

117
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,489
and assist it to function
as a regional government expand.

118
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,450
Of course, we'll need the government
to loosen regulations

119
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,910
and give it attention…

120
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,371
I heard Chairman Park's been arrested,

121
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,290
should we be here doing this?

122
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,960
At a time like this,
you smile in front of the camera

123
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:49,839
so those moronic investors rest easy,
and we can proceed as we planned.

124
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,883
But what if we go forward
and Chairman Park opens his mouth?

125
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:57,221
That's why I'm out here in the middle
of nowhere playing up the media.

126
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,473
The groundbreaking ceremony
will be moved up.

127
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,268
If we start selling the apartments
right after,

128
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,937
you'll get back much more
than what you invested.

129
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,733
Everything's going according the plan,
so don't worry.

130
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:09,859
Of course.

131
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,529
I knew it'd work out
if I trusted the two of you.

132
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,114
Yes.

133
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,450
-Come take a look around.
-Yes, let's go.

134
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,421
The water tastes great.

135
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,351
Hey.

136
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:45,645
I heard you weren't feeling well
after catching Gu Tae-su.

137
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:49,148
You should be getting rest,
what are you even looking at?

138
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,117
It's Hye-jun.

139
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,121
Yes. Take a closer look.

140
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,124
This familiar forearm.

141
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,593
I've got you, you scumbag.

142
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:21,555
No, that's not a mole,
I just got something on me.

143
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,807
Yes.

144
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,643
You jerk, you're dating Hye-jun,
aren't you?

145
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:26,727
Confess now,

146
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,730
and I'll let you off the hook
as long as you break up with her.

147
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:39,532
I can't live like this.

148
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,619
Han-jun, I…

149
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:03,431
I can't listen to this any longer.
You think I'm dating this idiot?

150
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,683
I have high standards.

151
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,726
If I ever date this idiot,

152
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,856
I'll clean this whole place
and wash my hair every day. Happy?

153
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:13,899
Wash your hair every day?

154
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,945
-Maybe it really isn't true.
-It isn't.

155
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,572
No, it isn't.

156
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:20,781
-You think so?
-Yes.

157
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,826
Are you freaking kidding me?

158
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,012
But why can't Su-cheol date Hye-jun?

159
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,555
Su-cheol's a really nice guy.

160
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,725
Do you think I don't know that?

161
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,020
Hye-jun's my one-and-only baby sister,

162
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,814
and Su-cheol's my bro and best friend.

163
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,358
So what if they start going out
and then break up?

164
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,903
Whose side am I supposed to take?

165
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,908
So you don't have severe sister issues.
I thought you were a pervert.

166
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,578
-Are you crazy?
-Come on…

167
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,164
Come here for another punch.

168
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:11,457
Now get this done already.

169
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,549
You should have taken it easy, Mayor.

170
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,593
She should have taken it easy.

171
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:26,222
She went crazy for the drugs
and just wouldn't stop struggling.

172
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:30,100
I was only going to scare her.
Who knew she'd die so easily?

173
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,687
Let's say you killed these three.

174
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,565
Do Jun-ha, Choi Yeong-seop,
Jeon Gyeong-cheol.

175
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,235
But you didn't kill Kang Eun-hye.

176
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:41,487
The mayor, Lee Myeong-jun, did.

177
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,405
I killed them all.

178
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,370
Your statement completely
contradicts the recording.

179
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,874
Are you sure you killed Kang Eun-hye?

180
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,460
I got a call from Mayor Lee Myeong-jun.

181
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,630
He said Kang Eun-hye overdosed on drugs
and fell unconscious.

182
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,507
Thankfully, she woke up,

183
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,635
but she said she didn't want
to do that kind of thing ever again

184
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,220
and threatened to call the police.

185
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,057
So I tried to take her phone
and ended up killing her.

186
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,643
Then why did you burn her body?

187
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,020
To destroy evidence.

188
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:18,816
You were trying to destroy evidence
but put the body in the sewers?

189
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,068
I didn't have time to take it far.

190
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,196
I was going to leave it in the sewers
and take care of it later,

191
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,156
but the police found it first,

192
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,909
so I called Choi Yeong-seop.

193
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,539
So you called Choi Yeong-seop
to frame him.

194
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:34,623
Yes.

195
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,710
When I helped him kill Do Jun-ha,

196
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:40,129
he said he would repay the favor one day.

197
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:43,215
Have you ever seen a perp confess
to everything like that?

198
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,472
It's possible if he feels
deeply guilty about the victim.

199
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,933
Does that look like the face
of someone who feels guilty?

200
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,352
I'm new, but even I think it's weird.

201
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,315
You're right.

202
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,866
Why did you put the white shoes
on Ms. Kang's feet?

203
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:12,912
Is it because Ms. Kang
resembles your mother, Mr. Gu?

204
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,457
No.

205
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,626
The two are completely different.

206
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:20,669
Is that so?

207
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,297
They look quite similar to me…

208
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,424
Both your mother

209
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:26,884
and Ms. Kang

210
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,929
never understood how you felt and
ended up leaving you.

211
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,597
They're different!

212
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:35,726
They're different.

213
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:40,189
My mother ran
because she was afraid of my father,

214
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,733
while Kang Eun-hye sinned.

215
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,028
I've only punished the sinners.

216
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,665
We put back together
the lines left on the cloth

217
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,792
and found two names,

218
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,543
Kang Eun-hye and Jeon Gyeong-cheol.

219
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:05,339
Who told you that

220
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,174
these people were sinners

221
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,676
and that they should be punished?

222
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,262
Auntie Im, the shaman you serve?

223
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,848
Or Cha Seung-won?

224
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,308
Neither of them

225
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:20,354
ever told me to kill.

226
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,566
Why are you trying to take all the blame?

227
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,154
I know Auntie Im took you in.

228
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:32,366
You might think she helped you,

229
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,450
but that's not true.

230
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:37,371
She's only using you.

231
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,124
She is a criminal who manipulates you

232
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,334
with her false rhetoric
to carry out murders.

233
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,337
So tell us. Tell us who it is

234
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,297
and why they're doing these things.

235
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,887
Keep mouthing off like that

236
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,723
and you might end up dead
like your brother.

237
00:16:58,809 --> 00:16:59,977
Prosecutor Han Jae-jeong.

238
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,730
He was your brother, right?

239
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,400
What?

240
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:09,611
Prosecutor Han was Ms. Han's brother?

241
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:11,780
Yes.

242
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:13,615
Ms. Han…

243
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:15,951
is the victim's family.

244
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:21,957
So that's why she became Han the Ghost.
Because of all her anger and grief.

245
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,251
Life is so unfair.

246
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:27,212
Bastards like him
should be burning in hell.

247
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:30,841
Damn it.

248
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:35,554
Now that I think about it,
not everyone I killed was a sinner.

249
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,057
There was Prosecutor Han.

250
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,433
I'd forgotten about him.

251
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:41,643
That's right.

252
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:46,482
Why did you kill Prosecutor Han
when he didn't do anything wrong?

253
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,859
He got in the way.

254
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,361
What?

255
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,572
Choi Yeong-seop confessed,

256
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:56,283
but he let him go on the grounds
of insufficient evidence.

257
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,035
He was too righteous.

258
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,121
If he had just prosecuted Choi Yeong-seop,

259
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,040
he'd still be alive.…

260
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,085
I do feel bad

261
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,921
about killing your brother.

262
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,216
After all that crap
about punishing sinners,

263
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,719
what did you just say?
You killed him because he was righteous?

264
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,263
You murderous bastard!

265
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,431
Hey, you scumbag.

266
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,391
Lim Yeong-ju.

267
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:29,191
Your mother would weep in anguish
if she found out

268
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,985
you became a murderer.

269
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:35,197
Right? Do you have any idea

270
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:38,784
how much your mother looked for you
after what happened to your father?

271
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,912
Don't you have any pity?

272
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:47,042
Think of your poor mother

273
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,546
and tell us the truth.

274
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:00,430
Prosecutor Han and everyone else,

275
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:04,184
I killed them all on my own.

276
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:07,354
It doesn't have anything

277
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,314
to do with Auntie Im.

278
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,876
Hey, why are you all so down?

279
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,544
Did you still not get a confession?

280
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,296
I had no idea.

281
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,631
I'm such a bad colleague.

282
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:39,052
Pretend you don't know anything about this
until she tells you herself.

283
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,637
Don't be obvious about it.

284
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,181
Okay.

285
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,059
We shouldn't get worked up
and ruin the case

286
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,770
when she's being so strong.

287
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:52,316
What is it?

288
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,276
Come on, did something happen to Ms. Han?

289
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,703
-What is it?
-Damn it.

290
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,522
Do you think you can continue
with the interrogation?

291
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,524
If it's too hard, I could--

292
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:38,153
No. I can do it. I'll do it.

293
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,739
I'm going to control my temper

294
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,491
without punching him and finish this well.

295
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,577
Okay.

296
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:49,289
But let's call it a day today.
I think you need some rest, Jae-hui.

297
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,711
Would you like to have dinner with me?

298
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:57,339
I have something
I want to talk to you about.

299
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,591
I'm sorry.

300
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,718
I can't today.

301
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,722
I want to go see Jae-jeong,

302
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,933
and I have someone I have to meet.

303
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,935
Is that person Mr. Nam?

304
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,229
Yes.

305
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,775
When I think about how he must be
feeling the same way I do right now,

306
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,737
it makes me worried,
and I want to be there for him.

307
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,243
He's such a stuck-up know-it-all

308
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:29,204
that I'm sure he's somewhere
hurting over this on his own.

309
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,664
Bye, then.

310
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,166
Can you not go?

311
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,219
Ever since you met Mr. Nam,

312
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:48,598
you keep finding yourself
in danger and getting hurt.

313
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:52,019
I'm worried that he might hurt you again,

314
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:55,647
Jae-hui.

315
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:59,985
Mr. Cha, do you…

316
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,320
Yes.

317
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,160
I like you a lot, Jae-hui.

318
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,543
This wasn't how I wanted to tell you…

319
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,256
I was trying to stop my feelings,

320
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,759
telling myself that I'm happy
just being your friend,

321
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:28,180
but I get jealous when you smile
as you talk about him,

322
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,058
and when I see you worry about him.

323
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:34,686
It's a little hard.

324
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,783
You were already having a hard day.

325
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,952
I shouldn't have told you that.

326
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,665
Don't let it concern you.

327
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:00,796
Shall we go back in?

328
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:03,799
Mr. Cha.

329
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,345
I am so grateful to you.

330
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:13,058
I don't think I could have endured this
all by myself if it weren't for you.

331
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,269
But…

332
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,313
You don't feel anything more than that.

333
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:27,114
Okay. Next time we meet,

334
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,282
I'll maintain

335
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:35,497
my boundaries.
As your friend and colleague.

336
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,349
Jae-jeong.

337
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,770
I finally caught the bastard
who killed you.

338
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,565
I'm sorry you had to wait so long.

339
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:05,235
I'm going to catch everyone
who was behind him too,

340
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,279
so don't worry and wait for me.

341
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,661
HAN JAE-JEONG

342
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:23,086
Next time,

343
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,880
I'll come with Jang-mi…

344
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,382
I mean, Jae-hui.

345
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:28,717
HAN JAE-JEONG

346
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,926
Well…

347
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:32,637
The truth is…

348
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,683
Jae-hui and I…

349
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,070
The lights…

350
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,284
Hey.

351
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,787
You're not angry, are you?

352
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,248
You're scaring me, you punk.

353
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:13,094
When this is all over,
and I'm allowed to be happy,

354
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:15,972
I'll tell her then.

355
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:21,478
Bye.

356
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:28,860
Jae-jeong…

357
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:45,794
HAN JAE-JEONG

358
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,799
I knew he'd come.

359
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:55,095
Jae-jeong, you heard, right?

360
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,722
I caught Gu Tae-su, that scumbag.

361
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:01,643
It was thanks to Mr. Nam
and how he never gave up.

362
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:03,979
I'm not going to give up either.

363
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:06,731
I'm going to get to the bottom of it

364
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,151
just like you wanted.

365
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,074
I'll be back again.

366
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:38,722
The number you have called cannot be
reached. Leave a message after the beep.

367
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,308
NAM HAN-JUN

368
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,689
Enjoy.

369
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,027
Mr. Jo.

370
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,612
Oh? Inspector.

371
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,948
The boss isn't here today,
so what brings you here?

372
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,617
Where is Mr. Nam right now?
His phone was off.

373
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,244
He said he had an outside appointment.

374
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,040
Are you the only one here?

375
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,750
I don't see Mr. Kong or Ms. Nam.

376
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:12,422
They say new converts are the worst…

377
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:15,967
CAFÉ MINAMDANG

378
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,595
Look at those pretty fireworks.

379
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,806
When did you prepare this?

380
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,224
-It's pretty.
-It is.

381
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,729
Hye-jun, who made you this pretty?

382
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:31,232
Su-cheol, who was it
that made you so handsome?

383
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,193
And you're smart.

384
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:35,445
And you're nice

385
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:36,654
and a great cook.

386
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:37,864
Who's a pretty boy?

387
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:39,532
Who's the best?

388
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:42,077
But what if

389
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,581
Han-jun finds out about this?
We'll be screwed.

390
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:47,999
No.

391
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,293
Nam Han-jun

392
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,337
isn't coming home today.

393
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,505
Really?

394
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,720
Where's Mr. Nam headed right now?

395
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:08,770
I can't tell you. Han-jun thinks I erased
the GPS tracking app on his phone.

396
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,480
-We can't tell you.
-Really?

397
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:12,857
I'll just tell Mr. Nam
that you two were just kissing--

398
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,276
-He's going to Gangwon-do.
-Yes.

399
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,029
He went to a camping ground
that has a view of Dong River.

400
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,155
A camping ground?

401
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,949
You think it's weird too, right?

402
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,993
He shudders when he has to go
to a non-luxury hotel,

403
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:26,079
but he forks over money
to go there every year.

404
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:28,706
Do you want me to tell you the location?

405
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:31,626
No, that's okay.
I think I know where it is.

406
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:33,962
-What?
-Your secret's safe with me.

407
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:34,879
Okay.

408
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:39,050
You two can go back to
what you were doing.

409
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:45,557
I want to go on a trip too.

410
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,558
You do?

411
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,309
Let's go to Gangwon-do.

412
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,853
-Right now?
-Yes.

413
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:55,024
Okay. If you say you want to go,
then we have to go.

414
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:57,986
-Come on. Let's go.
-Shall we?

415
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:01,364
-We'll go camping
-And have a barbecue.

416
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:04,367
Both of you go back to your posts
before I tell the boss everything.

417
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:07,370
I'm not going to stay quiet
if you run off again.

418
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,040
No hand-holding!

419
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,084
No kissing!

420
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,211
Back to your posts!

421
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,590
Let's go.

422
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:24,137
Be careful.

423
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:02,842
Let's begin.

424
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,302
HAN JAE-JEONG

425
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,805
Shoot.

426
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:08,765
This isn't a good sign.

427
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:17,899
Damn it.

428
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:25,490
Han Jae-jeong, that moron. What's to like
about all this inconvenience?

429
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,325
This is why I don't like camping.

430
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:30,411
All right. Wait.

431
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,039
Jae-jeong.

432
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:41,339
Han Jae-jeong.
Are you really going to be like this?

433
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:43,842
I didn't know she was your sister.

434
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,760
I already had feelings for her,
so what can I do?

435
00:30:57,313 --> 00:31:00,358
You can't put up the poles
before you put the pegs in.

436
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:01,651
What…

437
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,579
You know how to set up a tent so well.

438
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,504
But how did you know I was here?

439
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:24,048
I was at your café earlier
and your sister told me.

440
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,967
-Hye-jun?
-Yes.

441
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,093
Hye-jun?

442
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:33,141
What's she doing, testing my self-control?

443
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,143
What did you say?

444
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,311
What?

445
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,898
I asked you if this place
wasn't too hard to find.

446
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:43,776
I see. I used to come here
with Jae-jeong a lot.

447
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:49,657
So you were taking care of his things.

448
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,492
I had no idea.

449
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,536
Thank you.

450
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:02,795
I shall find a restaurant

451
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:06,507
that's right up your alley, Mr. Profiler.

452
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,885
-Somewhere really trendy.
-Somewhere that's totally hip.

453
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:12,263
Somewhere you'll get countless likes
if you upload a picture of it.

454
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:15,433
But legal.

455
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:18,603
Of course somewhere legal.
But no more nature-friendly places.

456
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:21,356
No more camping
where you can hear the water deer cry.

457
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:24,150
No. I'll cater to your tastes.

458
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:27,236
The client is the king, after all.

459
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,490
It's because I regret
that I didn't say yes more

460
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:33,785
when Jae-jeong begged me to go camping.

461
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,286
No need to thank me.

462
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,081
And, you know,

463
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:42,710
I come when I think of Jae-jeong.

464
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:47,298
He used to pester me
to go with him all the time too.

465
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,677
It was a habit of his,
don't let it weigh on you.

466
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:57,100
I wish the three of us
came together back then.

467
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:01,020
Then it wouldn't have taken us
such a long time to meet.

468
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:03,731
Well…

469
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:08,277
I guess we were destined to meet.

470
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,037
Come on.

471
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,582
Come on. Stop it.

472
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:39,559
This is so nice and relaxing to take
a walk and breathe in the clean air.

473
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:43,938
Gu Tae-su's been giving me
a headache all day.

474
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:46,733
Gu Tae-su…

475
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:51,070
confessed that he killed Jae-jeong.

476
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,367
Wait. Did you interrogate him yourself?

477
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:59,037
You should have had another detective
or Mr. Cha do it.

478
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,538
Why would you do it yourself?

479
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,750
Because I'm the one who wants
to know the truth the most.

480
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:07,712
You're unbelievable.

481
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:11,591
I held back my urge to kill him
to do the interrogation,

482
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:14,552
but he said he was in it alone.

483
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,512
At this rate,

484
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:19,432
we won't be able to prosecute
Auntie Im even if we arrest her.

485
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:21,976
It's because he's been gaslighted
for such a long time.

486
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,896
We need to make him doubt Auntie Im

487
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,898
if we want him to confess.

488
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,442
"Doubt…"

489
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,195
That won't be easy.

490
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:34,947
When has it ever been easy?

491
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:43,456
I really missed that smile of yours today.

492
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:50,630
Come on, you're coming at me like that
without any warning?

493
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:51,547
You can't do that.

494
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,966
I've been controlling myself
very well so far.

495
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:58,596
Well, the case isn't completely closed,

496
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,681
but we did catch Gu Tae-su,

497
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:04,936
so can't we just date like normal people?

498
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,608
I'm just saying that's how I feel.

499
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,912
I don't think Jae-jeong
really approves of me.

500
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:26,749
I've had so many accidents
since my visit to the columbarium.

501
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:33,756
I haven't had anything to eat
all day. Stop growling.

502
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,301
To really relax, you need to eat well too.

503
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,972
Let's just go up that thing
and then go eat.

504
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:42,181
Come on, let's go.

505
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:45,852
I heard it's really nice up there,
with a great view.

506
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:49,188
Hey, wait for me.

507
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,082
Here you go.

508
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:13,880
Hey, what is it this time?

509
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,718
Granny pants again?

510
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,094
You look like a tree.

511
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,142
All right.

512
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:29,145
This is the one. Go put it on.

513
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,897
What? No, wait…

514
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:41,199
It's perfect.

515
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,457
Shall we try this?

516
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,670
Thank you.

517
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,589
-It's good, right?
-This is good.

518
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,428
Open wide.

519
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:09,060
It's fascinating everywhere.

520
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:27,620
It's hot, isn't it?

521
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,601
Mr. Nam. Dance.

522
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:52,853
-Dance?
-Yes.

523
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,817
Seriously?

524
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:34,395
Like this?

525
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,886
It looks like it's raining flowers.

526
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:12,767
Did you know this?

527
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,853
If you catch a falling flower
while thinking of someone you like,

528
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,521
your love will be reciprocated.

529
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:18,689
What?

530
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:22,234
Who on earth comes up with those things?

531
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:35,289
In the end, all flowers wither. So why do
people give them meanings like that?

532
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,083
It's beautiful because it's momentary.

533
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,711
And even when they're gone,
you still remember.

534
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:44,173
Us being here together today,

535
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,301
the memories we have with Jae-jeong,

536
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,261
it's all there in our hearts.

537
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:53,140
It means a lot to me.

538
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:02,108
Did you just see that?

539
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:04,777
Did you see how this landed right here?

540
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,986
It really did.

541
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:13,536
Actually,

542
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:17,206
I also really wanted to see you today.

543
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:19,959
I thought about how you

544
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:23,462
must be missing Jae-jeong a lot like I do,

545
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,923
and how you'd want someone to comfort you

546
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:27,299
root for you,

547
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:30,386
and pat you on the back.

548
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,848
I just couldn't take
how much I missed you.

549
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:40,354
You did well.

550
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:43,941
I'll tell you instead of Jae-jeong.

551
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,365
You did well, Nam Han-jun.

552
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:55,744
I'll forgive you for everything
and give you my blessing.

553
00:40:57,163 --> 00:41:00,624
That's what Jae-jeong would have said
if he'd heard what you said before.

554
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:04,879
About how you've already fallen for me.

555
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:13,512
You said yes.

556
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:18,517
I like you,

557
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:20,895
Jae-hui.

558
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:18,619
Are you up?

559
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:21,038
Yes.

560
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:30,631
I didn't have any coffee.

561
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:31,924
Try this.

562
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,551
It'll warm you up.

563
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,095
Okay.

564
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,312
What a peaceful weekend.

565
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:49,817
Something always comes up
when you say things like that.

566
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,859
No way.

567
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:51,944
Right?

568
00:42:58,659 --> 00:42:59,868
VVIP LEE MIN-GYEONG

569
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:10,588
PAIN IN THE ASS

570
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,767
PAIN IN THE ASS

571
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,062
-Mr. Shaman.
-What is it?

572
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:29,231
Cha Seung-won is up to something.

573
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,567
Mr. Shaman. It's bad. Where are you?

574
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,903
Come to Minamdang by 12.

575
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:36,614
By 12? Yes, okay.

576
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:40,868
I knew it.

577
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,621
I guess we'll have
to drink coffee at Minamdang.

578
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,040
Yes.

579
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:49,084
But we can still have a cup of tea…

580
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:59,595
MINAMDANG

581
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:10,898
What are you doing?

582
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:16,278
Holy crap.

583
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,405
Why is he back so soon?

584
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:21,200
Why does he have to be so diligent?

585
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:24,495
He went all the way to Gangwon-do.
Why did he come home in the morning?

586
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:27,289
He's going to kill us if he finds out
we stayed out last night.

587
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:32,211
Ta-da.

588
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:45,599
Do I look like I've had a good sleep
instead of having fun all night?

589
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:49,603
Yes. Your skin looks so fresh.
You're so pretty. You really are.

590
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:52,189
But that won't change the fact
that he'll kill us.

591
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:56,276
I made preparations just in case.

592
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:00,864
Over there.

593
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,909
That? There?

594
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:10,290
-Are you sure we can do this?
-Of course. Don't worry.

595
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:13,877
Okay.

596
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:17,881
Kong Su-cheol.

597
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:19,675
Nam Hye-jun.

598
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,844
Jo Na-dan.

599
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,304
Why isn't anyone here?

600
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:27,349
-Sit over there in the middle.
-Okay.

601
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:29,435
Kong Su-cheol.

602
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,771
Nam Hye-jun. Jo Na-dan.

603
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:35,023
Boss, I'm here.

604
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,692
-Hey. You're here.
-Yes.

605
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:38,819
The cakes sold out yesterday.

606
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:39,820
You're here early.

607
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:43,115
My signature drink, please.

608
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:44,992
I already made it.

609
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,827
He's a smart one.

610
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:50,414
Here you go.

611
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,208
Thank you.

612
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:55,711
-Where's Su-cheol?
-He's not here yet.

613
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:58,839
He's seriously becoming lax.

614
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:01,550
Wait.

615
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:04,094
What about Hye-jun?

616
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:07,014
I don't know.
She's still usually sleeping at this hour.

617
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,724
Right. She always sleeps in.

618
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:15,314
Shoot.

619
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:17,316
Hold on tight.

620
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:27,117
Boss!

621
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,620
Your favorite thing on the menu.

622
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,084
This is good.

623
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:43,091
It's nice and filling in the morning.

624
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:58,690
Hold on. Wait.

625
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:07,324
-I better wake Hye-jun and give her some.
-Mr. Nam.

626
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:10,953
You have cream on your face.

627
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:20,796
Gosh. This is so sweet.

628
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:24,383
Just a minute.
I'll wake Hye-jun and be right back.

629
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:25,759
Okay.

630
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:30,305
My legs went weak.

631
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,854
Nam Hye-jun.

632
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:44,152
Hey, Nam Hye-jun.

633
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:50,450
Where is she?

634
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,244
What? What do you want?

635
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:57,165
Why aren't you working?

636
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:59,376
My goodness.

637
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:02,588
You washed your face when no one
made you do it? What's going on?

638
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:03,964
Where's Su-cheol?

639
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:07,134
Su-cheol is coming in late
because he was up all night.

640
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:09,219
Up all night? Why?

641
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:10,178
"Why"?

642
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:12,014
You told him to find Auntie Im.

643
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:14,474
While you were having a lovey-dovey time,

644
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:16,685
Su-cheol kept an eye
on Auntie Im's temple all night.

645
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:18,729
That's right.

646
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:20,147
He must be tired.

647
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:22,816
I'm here.

648
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:26,612
I haven't had such good sleep
in a long time. I feel great--

649
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:31,116
What?

650
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:34,786
Hye-jun said you'd be tired
from being up all night.

651
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,163
Right.

652
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,459
That's right. I'm so tired.

653
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:43,712
It's a miracle I'm still standing upright.

654
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:45,172
I'm so tired.

655
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:54,681
Mr. Shaman, I've got big news

656
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:57,809
Gosh, this is tiring already.

657
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:04,107
There's been a huge influx of projects
about the Jakdu-dong project.

658
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,026
And lo and behold, there are rumors that

659
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:08,654
the Land Hunter Team has joined
the Shovel of Sinmyeong.

660
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:11,198
-Land Hunter?
-Yes.

661
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,742
They're famous real estate
planning fraudsters.

662
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:15,911
But why would they
be joining this project?

663
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:19,539
They probably want to play up the media
to boost up sales as much as possible.

664
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:23,627
Worst come to worst, theyll sell
the apartments and run with the money.

665
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:27,130
God, those fucking bastards.

666
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:30,967
Do they have any idea what hell people
have to go through to buy an apartment?

667
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:32,511
This is crossing the line.

668
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:35,972
But it's Choekang Construction.
I'm sure they won't--

669
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:39,559
The shareholder's meeting is coming soon,
and coupled with Uncle's arrest,

670
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,728
my brother must be in a rush.

671
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,773
Mr. Shaman. An acquaintance of mine

672
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:46,316
has invested in the Jakdu-dong--

673
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,694
Unless you want your name
paraded in the media,

674
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:49,986
pull your investments now.

675
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,989
Yes. There's something urgent
I have to do, so…

676
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:54,658
Bye.

677
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:01,623
Right. Mr. Shaman, I also have
something urgent to tend to.

678
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:02,999
I'll get going then.

679
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:05,085
Bye.

680
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,255
MINAMDANG

681
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,135
Why are you lagging behind?

682
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:16,096
It's just that you told me
to keep my distance.

683
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,973
Are you stupid?

684
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:20,183
-Come on.
-Wait for me.

685
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:23,854
Come on.

686
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,940
I'm getting a whiff of something
from those two too.

687
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:31,945
When is the groundbreaking ceremony?

688
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,531
THE SHOVEL OF SINMYEONG

689
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,451
It's been pushed up by two days.

690
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:39,870
The sales schedule has been pushed up

691
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:41,955
to the day
after the groundbreaking ceremony.

692
00:50:42,038 --> 00:50:45,375
I don't think we'll be able to find
evidence that'll let us stop the project

693
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:47,085
before the sales begin.

694
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:49,212
What? But that won't do.

695
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:51,882
All those innocent people
will be robbed of their money.

696
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:54,050
We need to arrest them
before that happens.

697
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:57,053
-What, do you have an idea?
-We'll strike during the ceremony.

698
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:58,764
-The groundbreaking ceremony?
-Yes.

699
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:02,559
I'll send the evidence
from Gu Tae-su's laptop to the station.

700
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:08,982
But we don't have a warrant for that so
it might put Jae-hui in a tricky position.

701
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:12,360
I can use it if it's an anonymous tip.

702
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:15,363
Bingo. Aren't you just adorable?

703
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:18,742
-We can get the warrant, right?
-I'll look for a way to make it work.

704
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:22,454
Why do I get the feeling we're a
bad influence on them?

705
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:26,875
People always pick up bad habits
the fastest.

706
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:28,502
MAJOR CRIMES DIVISION 7

707
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:36,802
MAJOR CRIMES DIVISION 7

708
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:40,722
Look. Someone sent our team a package.

709
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:42,849
I wonder who sent it?

710
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:45,769
It's been there for a while now.

711
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:52,108
Then shall we open it
and find out what's in here?

712
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:53,235
Okay.

713
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:57,989
Oh?

714
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:01,576
Hey. What's this?

715
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,786
A USB drive?

716
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,747
There's a card here too.

717
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:09,793
-A card?
-What does it say?

718
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:15,382
It says they want to report something
about the Kang Eun-hye case.

719
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,300
-The Kang Eun-hye case?
-Yes.

720
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:20,554
Then shall we take a look?

721
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:23,098
-Shall we?
-Okay.

722
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:35,151
Gosh.

723
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,489
God, what the hell is this?

724
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:43,743
-Those sons of…
-I can't believe these bastards.

725
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:45,871
Those fucking scum.

726
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:49,499
They ought to be flayed. Those bastards.

727
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:51,293
Oh, god.

728
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:55,797
Mayor Lee Myeong-jun.

729
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:02,888
It was an anonymous tip.

730
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:05,098
Just in case,
we checked to see if it's real,

731
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:06,933
but the video shows no signs
of manipulation.

732
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,567
Arrest them as soon as we get a warrant.

733
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:18,445
Lieutenant, you're in charge.

734
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:21,948
And the rest of you, assist
Major Crimes Investigation Division Seven.

735
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,158
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

736
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:51,269
We shall begin
the groundbreaking ceremony.

737
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:54,230
On the count of three,
please break the ground as a symbol

738
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:56,650
of your wishes for the
success of this project.

739
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:59,569
One, two, three.

740
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:05,492
JAKDU-DONG LAND DEVELOPMENT
GROUNDBREAKING CEREMONY

741
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:20,423
I heard Uncle's been arrested.

742
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:25,345
I wonder if that old geezer
can take prison at that age.

743
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:26,763
Hey, you…

744
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:30,684
Hey, worry about yourself.

745
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,769
Even your dad's shareholders
think you're crap.

746
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:34,104
Who do you think you are?

747
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:38,858
I guess you've got someone
watching your back even without Uncle.

748
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:44,447
-Min-gyeong.
-What?

749
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:49,828
Mr. Shaman said he's going to kick
everyone's ass. Wait a bit longer.

750
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:52,914
We'll commence the ceremony to pray
for the safe completion of the project.

751
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:55,417
We ask that our guests take their seats.

752
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:07,095
CHOEKANG CONSTRUCTION
SINMYEONG

753
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,691
On the 25th day of the 4th month
of the year of the black tiger,

754
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:21,609
we pray to the gods of heaven and earth.

755
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:25,155
Today, after all the effort that was made,
we take our first step to begin

756
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:26,740
the long-awaited Jakdu-dong project.

757
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:30,368
These offerings were prepared as a sign
of our heartfelt dedication to you.

758
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:32,245
We pray that you watch over the project

759
00:55:32,328 --> 00:55:34,748
and help everything go smoothly,
without accidents.

760
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,231
Why are their two shamans?

761
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:26,943
Auntie must have prepared a big ritual
for the groundbreaking ceremony.

762
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:38,329
You fool!

763
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:41,458
Auntie Im, your prayers

764
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:43,460
have been rejected by the spirits.

765
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:47,922
I know how human greed is limitless,

766
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:50,800
but the gall to wreak havoc
while using the spirits' name.

767
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,343
This is true.

768
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:57,182
Yes and now, to introduce
our contestants today.

769
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:59,893
On the Red Team,

770
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:01,853
the wonder of Yonghae-dong,

771
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:04,689
Shaman Nam Han-jun.

772
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:08,568
What a cutie.

773
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:12,655
And on the White Team,

774
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:15,158
the defending champion,

775
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:19,078
Auntie Im of Buja-dong, Im Hui-suk.

776
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:25,376
-Yes, Mr. Shaman.
-Yes.

777
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:27,629
-You can do it.
-Yes, good luck.

778
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:31,257
On this 25th day

779
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,134
of the fourth month

780
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:35,345
of the year of the black tiger,

781
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:39,015
we pray to the gods of heaven and earth.

782
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,977
Here, the most viles leeches gather

783
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:45,772
to suck the blood of the people

784
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:48,608
under the pretense

785
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:51,986
of the land development project.

786
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:53,738
So!

787
00:58:53,821 --> 00:58:58,284
With your rage toward
these offerings of deceit, I ask you

788
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:02,080
to give me your power and help me

789
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:03,623
put these scum behind bars.

790
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:06,668
I pray that you look upon us.

791
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,420
You fool!

792
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:11,381
How dare you speak your lies here!

793
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:14,300
You scoundrel! How dare you judge me?

794
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:19,180
You think just because those people
look up to you from down there,

795
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:20,807
and you look down on them from up here,

796
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:23,059
that the world is yours to command?

797
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:24,644
No!

798
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:29,899
You're just a criminal committing
every crime that can be imagined

799
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:31,943
under the spirits' name.

800
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:33,987
Just a criminal.

801
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:36,114
Do you truly wish to die this much?

802
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:38,199
Do you not fear the spirits?

803
00:59:39,867 --> 00:59:42,245
The one who should be getting lost is you.

804
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:44,872
Prison is the place where you belong.

805
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:46,708
Prison.

806
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:51,421
THE JAKDU-DONG DEVELOPMENT CORRUPTION

807
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:56,884
The depraved soul who sold drugs
to make illegal contributions

808
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:58,803
to the mayor of Sinmyeong

809
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:01,139
to start the Jakdu-dong land
development project.

810
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:02,056
This man!

811
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:05,810
He approved the project in record time

812
01:00:05,893 --> 01:00:08,896
and rushed to pass a truly ridiculous bill
through trickery.

813
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:13,234
The depraved soul who turned a blind eye
to these underhanded deals.

814
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:20,533
The villainous shaman
who took the spirits' name in vain

815
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:22,160
to commit all sorts of crimes

816
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:24,495
for money.

817
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:26,372
You villain. Tell me then.

818
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:29,417
Who led this pack of crooks?

819
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:32,879
Their leader is

820
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:35,882
the scoundrel who sold his land
to the government

821
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:37,967
for a ridiculous sum
and is trying to become

822
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:40,511
the chairman of Choekang company

823
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:42,889
by committing real estate fraud.

824
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:44,390
Yes, you.

825
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:47,810
You, right there.

826
01:00:57,570 --> 01:01:01,199
EPILOGUE

827
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:10,375
I'm sorry,

828
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:14,545
but there is no cure
for antisocial personality disorder.

829
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:17,090
The only thing to do
is modify his behavior

830
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:20,343
through continued counseling and lessons.

831
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:57,964
CHA SEUNG-WON

832
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:00,675
Stand up.

833
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:02,552
Hey, get up.

834
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:09,183
Harder!

835
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:46,554
Do you think it makes sense
that a head of a conglomerate went ahead

836
01:02:46,637 --> 01:02:49,223
with a business worth hundreds
of billions over what a shaman said?

837
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:51,017
I had been pretty naive.

838
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:53,436
It looks like they're trying to pin
everything on Auntie Im.

839
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:54,812
Did you look into Cha Seung-won's past?

840
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:56,355
It's full of all sorts of urban legends.

841
01:02:56,439 --> 01:03:00,318
A friend who died unfairly 20 years ago
is still roaming the realm of the living.

842
01:03:00,401 --> 01:03:02,987
Don't you think we might be
able to find new evidence

843
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:04,697
with your profiling skills and my memory?

844
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:07,158
I will find where Auntie Im is
as quickly as possible.

845
01:03:07,241 --> 01:03:08,701
I'll need to leave a warning

846
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,787
to those bastards who ruined the ceremony.

847
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:15,875
