1
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:38,830
Open the door!

2
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,469
Open the door!

3
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,138
Help!

4
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,739
Who's it going to be, me or her?

5
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:15,700
Help…

6
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:26,920
Jae-hui!

7
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:28,797
Jae-hui, I'll get you out.

8
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,777
What the hell? There's a fire.

9
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,737
You don't think…

10
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,614
No, it can't be. Let's go.

11
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,341
-It's too dangerous.
-I have to save Jae-hui.

12
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,113
Jae-hui.

13
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:57,760
Jae-hui. Come on, please.

14
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:02,307
Mr. Nam.

15
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,524
If something happened to you too, I'd…

16
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,692
Mr. Nam.

17
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,161
Han-jun!

18
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:24,871
Mr. Nam.

19
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,500
Wake up, Mr. Nam.

20
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,396
EPISODE 13

21
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,471
Who's the pretty girl?

22
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:28,518
But why are you here
and not inside Han-jun's room?

23
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,523
I've never seen Han-jun like that before.

24
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,109
What? What did he look like?

25
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:40,113
Han-jun is the most cool-headed person
I've ever known, but back there,

26
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,700
he looked like he couldn't see
or hear anything,

27
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,953
other than Detective Han.

28
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:48,454
Yes.

29
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:50,915
It seemed that way.

30
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,086
-But…
-Yes?

31
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,422
-I think I'd be like that too.
-What?

32
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,924
I think I'll die without you now.

33
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,634
-What?
-So

34
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,137
you better not die before me.

35
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,515
I'm going to chase you down
to the end of the afterworld and kill you.

36
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:09,934
Okay.

37
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,437
Don't worry.

38
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,606
I won't go anywhere. I'm going to stick
to you like this for the rest of my life.

39
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,276
Same here.

40
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,910
Are you awake?

41
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,261
I was afraid I'd dreamed I rescued you.

42
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:48,723
I'm so glad it wasn't.

43
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:56,189
Were you that scared that I might die?

44
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:57,982
I promised Jae-jeong

45
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:00,860
I'd protect you.

46
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:06,074
Are you trying to tell me that you
think of me as your little sister again?

47
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,327
Are you okay?

48
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,120
I'm fine.

49
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,457
I tend to overreact.

50
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,168
And I scare easily.

51
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,337
That's why…

52
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,342
I might run again. Because I'm afraid

53
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:27,136
I might lose someone I care for again.

54
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,432
But I realized something today.

55
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,185
Even if I run,

56
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,397
I'll end up coming back to you in the end.

57
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,112
Could you wait for me a little?

58
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,991
After I catch Gopuri
and get Jae-jeong's permission,

59
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:50,993
then,

60
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,913
I'll give you my entire heart.

61
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,307
Ouch.

62
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,642
No.

63
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,018
Don't pull away.

64
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:36,581
So what if the evidence was there?
Do you think you have nine lives?

65
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:37,915
What's going on?

66
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,543
I'm a detective
and there was a ton of evidence there.

67
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,171
-Next time, just walk straight past it.
-I think it's Han-jun.

68
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,590
-Save yourself first, got it?
-Those idiots.

69
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,216
-Whatever.
-I stayed here,

70
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,135
-to give them the space,
-"Whatever"?

71
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,762
-and they're staging a soap opera instead.
-Wait.

72
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:53,181
Nam Han-jun!

73
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,516
-Jeez, you startled me.
-Gosh.

74
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,186
When on earth are you going to grow up?

75
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,813
I'm sure he will, someday. Come on.

76
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:04,233
-Hey, I'm your big brother.
-"Big brother"? Thanks for bringing it up.

77
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:08,237
But if you want me to treat you like my
big brother, then start acting like one.

78
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,324
-All that "love yourself" crap, and--
-Wait.

79
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:14,494
Aren't you being too harsh
on your brother? Come on, he's hurt…

80
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:18,247
What? Now that I think about it,
I'm hurt too.

81
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,209
And don't talk like that to my girl.
I mean, my sister.

82
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,836
Your sister? How's she your sister?
She's Mr. Nam's sister.

83
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,672
Why are you yelling at him
when he's done nothing wrong?

84
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,008
-Hey. Are you my sister, or his?
-My goodness.

85
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,092
Him. His sister.

86
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,136
After all I've done to raise you.

87
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,846
Why are you being so hard on her?

88
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,890
What are you suddenly throwing a fit for?

89
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:40,061
"Fit"? I'm not having a fit.
And you didn't pay me the rent last month.

90
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,021
-What?
-The rent.

91
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,439
Are you crazy? Jeez.

92
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,815
It's okay.

93
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,067
Han.

94
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:47,735
Ma'am.

95
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:50,446
Ma'am, you scared us half to death
when we heard the news.

96
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,491
You were admitted yesterday.
Is it okay for you to go home already?

97
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:56,536
I only breathed in a little smoke.
I'm perfectly fine.

98
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,997
Damn it, this is all Gu Tae-su's fault.
That scumbag.

99
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,165
Hey.

100
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,168
I'm the one hurt.
Why isn't anyone asking how I am?

101
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,586
Right.

102
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,089
I heard you saved Ms. Han.

103
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:11,717
-Wow. I didn't know you had it in you.
-I know, right?

104
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,763
It's the unimpressive ones
you need to watch out for.

105
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,557
You certainly are amazing.

106
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,351
Your words seem
to have some thorns in them.

107
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,689
Never mind. What about Gu Tae-su?
What happened to him?

108
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:28,442
We're working with the local precinct
to chase him down,

109
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,528
but I think it'll be hard to catch him.

110
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:34,115
I can't believe Gu Tae-su tried
to kill an officer, that bastard.

111
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:37,994
When I get my hands on him,
I'm going to snap his neck and rip out--

112
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,620
Mr. Jang.

113
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,330
We did get evidence.

114
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,672
I wasn't sure until now, but Gu Tae-su

115
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,966
really is Lim Yeong-ju.

116
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,801
Wait. Do you know him?

117
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,433
How do you have this picture?

118
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:03,936
He was the suspect
in my first murder case.

119
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:08,441
But he must have been a kid then.
A murder suspect?

120
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,444
He didn't have it easy.

121
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,280
I'm your father.

122
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,949
You better damn well listen to me.

123
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,034
Come here.

124
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,328
You think you can ignore me?

125
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:25,458
Damn it, listen to me when I tell you
to do something. Okay?

126
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,919
Lim Yeong-ju's father was an alcoholic.

127
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,880
Go and get the things I told you to.

128
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,923
His mother had run away already,

129
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,885
leaving that little kid alone
with his father.

130
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:39,805
Though he hardly deserved to be called
that, his father was drunk all the time,

131
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,433
cursing at him, hitting him,
and sending him to get more liquor.

132
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:47,313
He didn't take care of the kid at all.
He didn't even send him to school.

133
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,315
And then it happened.

134
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:53,527
I'm sorry, Dad. Please, don't hurt me.

135
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:57,615
Those eyes.
You're exactly like your mother.

136
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,533
You think your father's a loser, right?

137
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,745
You bastard. Just die.

138
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,539
You're going to die today, that's right.

139
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,959
You're dead. Just die.

140
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,212
Die.

141
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,265
You little…

142
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:37,363
He should have stopped there,

143
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,494
but he set the place on fire and ran,

144
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,371
knowing his father was still alive.

145
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:55,673
I'm sure there were plenty of chances
to reform him. So why…

146
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,092
He didn't have anyone around to teach him.

147
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:01,595
Since he was was a murder suspect,
people must've been scared of him.

148
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,892
So Lim Yeong-ju's been missing ever since?

149
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,854
I've kept asking around about him,

150
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,941
but he didn't go
to his relatives or his mother.

151
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,697
This is the last picture his mother took

152
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,699
with him before she left.

153
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,955
So that's why he put those white shoes
on the victim.

154
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,419
We need to find out
what happened to him since then.

155
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,463
There must have been an accomplice.

156
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:39,550
Yes and Auntie Im could be that person.

157
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,601
It's Na-dan.

158
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:53,564
-Hey, Na-dan.
-Hey, aren't we going to open the café?

159
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,149
-Did we close down?
-What?

160
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,234
-What is it?
-Did you not open the café?

161
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,237
I'll get going first.

162
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,822
Where are you off to?

163
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,329
Shall we get going too?

164
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,413
Okay.

165
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,457
Are you okay?

166
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,666
Of course.

167
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,168
I'm so glad you're okay.

168
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:19,173
CAFÉ MINAMDANG

169
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,593
I've unlocked Gu Tae-su's laptop

170
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:24,220
and found this weird picture.

171
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,598
DO JUN-HA, HAN JAE-JEONG

172
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,600
Do Jun-ha, and…

173
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,020
Han Jae-jeong.

174
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,105
It's my brother's name.

175
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,778
Jeez, that's creepy.
It's like old Korean ghost stories.

176
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:44,073
He wrote down the names of the people
he was going to kill on the gopuri cloth

177
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,574
and took pictures of it? Jeez.

178
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,909
But there's more.

179
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:50,162
Gu Tae-su also has folders
of everyone's sex videos.

180
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,918
It's a two-person system.

181
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,211
Auntie Im makes the prophecies,

182
00:13:57,294 --> 00:14:01,215
and Gu Tae-su makes them come true by
blackmailing people and calling in favors.

183
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:05,344
And when her prophecies came true,
people's faith in her would have grown.

184
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:08,389
So that's how she got those people
in the top one percent as her clients?

185
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:09,640
Jeez…

186
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,187
Hey, wait.

187
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,398
This place,
doesn't it look like a dance club?

188
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,483
NC?

189
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,237
N.Joy Club.
This place is really hot these days.

190
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,073
Celebrities, conglomerate heirs…

191
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,784
Anyone who has money
and likes to party gather there.

192
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,829
Those initials in the file names
might be for the N.Joy Club.

193
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,999
The dividends that the cartel members
received were from this club.

194
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,501
-Hi.
-Ms. Han, are you okay?

195
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:38,961
-I heard you got hurt.
-I'm fine.

196
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,798
She's fine, except that
she couldn't catch Gu Tae-su.

197
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,133
No need to worry.

198
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,760
I was talking to Ms. Han, not you.

199
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:50,472
The source of the Joyce Partners'
dividends. Great.

200
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,058
Good job. Very nice.

201
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,436
JOYCE PARTNERS
COMPANY CARD STATEMENT

202
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,273
JOYCE PARTNERS
COMPANY ACCOUNT STATEMENT

203
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:02,234
How good does business
have to be to give back to the investors

204
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,736
100 times what they put in?

205
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,905
Do all the young people in Korea
go to this club?

206
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,991
There's a rumor that drugs
are being dealt in N.Joy Club.

207
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,868
And that money is being laundered

208
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,953
and handed out as investment returns?

209
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:16,582
Narcotics trafficking is a felony.
Can't we just round them up on that?

210
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:19,001
They could claim
the club had nothing to do with it.

211
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,253
Then we'd only end up
with a few bottom-feeders.

212
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:24,131
We need actual proof,
not just circumstantial evidence.

213
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,182
Why don't we go undercover
to see if it's true?

214
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:36,769
What? You would go undercover?

215
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,563
Why? You don't think it'll work?

216
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,824
That's a great idea.

217
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,118
It's getting late,
so let's wrap it up for today.

218
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:56,538
We'll go undercover tomorrow
and collect anything we can use as proof.

219
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:58,749
Okay.

220
00:15:58,832 --> 00:15:59,917
Okay.

221
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,253
How do you know about N.Joy?

222
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:05,547
I'll take her.

223
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,592
I'll take her since you were injured too.

224
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,302
Come on, I said I'll do it.

225
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,972
You're going to drive with that hand?
Go get some rest.

226
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,933
It's just a bandage, okay? I'll take her.

227
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,101
I'll do it.

228
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,102
You go in and rest.

229
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:22,773
I live so close by.
Why would I take a car home?

230
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,692
I'll just walk and get some exercise.

231
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,736
-Bye.
-Bye.

232
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,657
I'll go for a walk as exercise too.

233
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,702
Drive home safely in that car of yours.

234
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,920
Mr. Cha.

235
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,505
-What are you doing?
-Cheer up.

236
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:49,258
You'll find somebody too.

237
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,343
He's right. Mr. Cha.

238
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,680
Good luck and call me
if you need me to set you up.

239
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:56,974
Give me your hand.

240
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:04,231
CAFÉ MINAMDANG

241
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:14,283
This is in the opposite direction
from my apartment.

242
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,910
All roads are the same.

243
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:21,415
Let's just take a more interesting one,
even if it takes more time.

244
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,502
Well, going slow isn't so bad.

245
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,348
-What?
-Nothing.

246
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,101
It's just nice to see you smile.

247
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:47,024
I wondered how you were doing
and worried too.

248
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:53,197
If you were so worried,
you should have let me visit you in jail.

249
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,032
Why did you always send me away?

250
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,329
The three of us are going
to put everything behind us

251
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,247
and start over in the United States.

252
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:06,335
So even if Jang-mi comes,
don't meet with her.

253
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:11,173
This is the last favor I'm asking you
as Jae-jeong's mother.

254
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:16,261
I'd hoped you'd forget everything bad
that'd happened and have a normal life.

255
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,847
You should've just let yourself forget.

256
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:19,932
Then you'd have

257
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:24,937
seen nicer things like you're
doing now, and laughed more.

258
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,981
Have you ever regretted
becoming a police officer?

259
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,151
Do you regret becoming a shaman

260
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,655
to catch Gopuri?

261
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,615
No, I don't.

262
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:40,619
I told you, I'd do anything
to catch the killer.

263
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,539
And you know, the money's good.

264
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:46,583
Plus, it kind of suits me.

265
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,466
You, though…

266
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:56,885
Hey.

267
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:01,140
I happen to be very happy and energetic.

268
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,434
Still,

269
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:07,479
I do regret it sometimes.

270
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:12,818
I regret how stupid I was
to fixate on Gopuri,

271
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,278
and how I doubted

272
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,866
and hated you even for a little while.

273
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:24,454
Now that I think back,
I have a lot of regrets.

274
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,917
I'm very glad

275
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,713
that I came back to Korea

276
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,591
and became a police officer

277
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,512
and met you again.

278
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:46,727
Gosh, I'd better catch Gopuri quick.

279
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:52,441
That way, you and I can be
like any other normal couple in love,

280
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,986
taking walks, eating out,

281
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,279
and going on dates.

282
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:02,409
I'll think about it when we catch Gopuri.

283
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:06,747
Wait. I thought we were going to go out
after we catch Gopuri.

284
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,791
I don't think I ever promised
anything like that.

285
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,711
So I misconstrued things on my own?

286
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,131
All right. Then promise me now.

287
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,134
Come on.

288
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,848
Hurry up and stamp your thumb.

289
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,373
Jeez, my heart nearly dropped.

290
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:50,832
Yes, they startled me too.

291
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,251
-They did?
-Yes.

292
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:55,087
But doesn't Han-jun hate crowded places?

293
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,338
Exactly.

294
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,216
Did love change him?
Or was he like that all along?

295
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,133
Maybe it's love.

296
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,143
Why do you have your eyes closed?

297
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:13,855
I got dust in them.

298
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:15,315
I see.

299
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,488
That can't be them, can it?

300
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,825
What? Do you know them?

301
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,994
No, just some strangers.

302
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:33,875
I heard there are boats here
during the day.

303
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:37,963
I saw them earlier, floating around.

304
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,046
Let's go.

305
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,104
Mr. Shaman, I'm here.

306
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,522
Mr. Shaman. Wait, stop.

307
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,817
What the hell?

308
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,238
-Unbelievable. Who the heck is it?
-Lee Min-gyeong, jeez.

309
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,574
You're such a pain, Jin-sang.
Move your car already.

310
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:50,160
-Why? I got here first.
-I'm going to miss Mr. Shaman.

311
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:52,287
-Mr. Shaman? Really?
-Hurry up. Come on.

312
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,915
-Come on!
-Nothing goes right when I'm with you.

313
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,879
The entrance is that way.

314
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:02,881
Be careful.

315
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,341
And you get a hold of yourself.

316
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,593
-Shall we?
-Let's.

317
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,977
Goodness.

318
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,482
Go ahead, miss.

319
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,071
All right. Let's go.

320
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:28,782
I've never been here before.

321
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,751
-Hey, I don't know who that is.
-What?

322
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,465
Damn it, come here.

323
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,801
I knew you'd get us stopped.

324
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:50,053
Where the hell did
you even find these clothes?

325
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:53,140
What? You told me to dress fancy
for parties like these.

326
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:57,352
You don't think they stopped us
because of my outfit, do you?

327
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:58,854
This is so embarrassing.

328
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,191
Come on, give me your hand.

329
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,234
Take it already.

330
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:06,236
Come on, I'm in a hurry.

331
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,700
Go right in, sir.

332
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,994
See? I told you it wasn't me.

333
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,040
-I can't believe that worked.
-Me too.

334
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:23,879
-You're younger than you look.
-Have a good time.

335
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,046
-Right.
-Go in, sir.

336
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:27,799
Let's go.

337
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,760
I know him.

338
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,429
He's a friend.

339
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,393
-Ma'am.
-"Ma'am"?

340
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:39,769
How do I look like a "ma'am" to you?

341
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,479
The hotel entrance is that way.

342
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:44,357
What the hell are you thinking right now?

343
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,401
-Move.
-Hey, move. Come on.

344
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:50,280
We're at the right place.
I'm in a hurry, so move, okay?

345
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,116
This is so annoying.

346
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,784
-What? "Annoying"?
-"Annoying"?

347
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,328
Come on. Throw them out.

348
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,372
-Wait. What do you mean "throw" me out?
-Hey, wait.

349
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,583
Let me go before I buy this club
and fire you all.

350
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,668
-Yes, sure.
-You think I can't do it?

351
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,378
-Let go.
-Yes, thank you, ma'am.

352
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,423
-"Thank you"? Let go of me.
-Yes. Thank you.

353
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:15,639
Cheers.

354
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,849
-You look pretty.
-Thanks.

355
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,226
That way.

356
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,811
Let's go!

357
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,124
I knew you had it planned all along.

358
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,462
Hey, take it.

359
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:48,713
Yes.

360
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,008
Here, take this too.

361
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,969
-I don't have any more hands…
-Just take it!

362
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:03,186
I should have suspected something
when you said yes so quickly.

363
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,397
I want to go dance too.

364
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,315
Na-dan. You see this loser here?

365
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,858
A loser?

366
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,068
Watch it.

367
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:13,363
Keep an eye on him and make sure
he doesn't get into any trouble.

368
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:15,573
You're in charge, okay? He's new to this.

369
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:21,788
Prosecutor--

370
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,208
Do-won, do you want to advertise
that you're undercover?

371
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,584
What?

372
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:30,588
Stand straight, clench your butt.

373
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:31,715
Thrust your chest out.

374
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,718
Hold your tray higher.
Like that, with one hand.

375
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:39,014
Na-dan, you better keep an eye on him.

376
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,727
Okay, then. Go around the place,
and if you see anything suspicious--

377
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,146
Focus!

378
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:48,732
If you see anything suspicious,
call me right away, okay?

379
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:51,401
-Okay.
-But where are those two anyway?

380
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,069
Let's go.

381
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,946
-It's nice here.
-Come on.

382
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,031
Damn it.

383
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,953
-Higher.
-All right. Just go, I've got it.

384
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,079
Go already.

385
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,477
Over there.

386
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,987
I think those red pills are the drugs.

387
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,739
Yes. Su-cheol,

388
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,117
I think we found the seller.

389
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,994
We'll mark him,
so you can catch and interrogate him.

390
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,413
Okay.

391
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,039
Let's go.

392
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,596
Oh, no!

393
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:47,642
-Damn it.
-What room were the guys in?

394
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,812
Not that way. This way.

395
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:55,108
Let's go see the guys.

396
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,493
There he is.

397
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,620
Let's get him and find out
where his boss is.

398
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:09,622
What?

399
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,627
I said, let's get him
and find out where his boss is.

400
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:15,754
Okay.

401
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:58,755
Well…

402
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,592
Prosecutor Cha. I think we'd better
call Han-jun and Su-cheol.

403
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:05,053
If we wait, we might be too late.

404
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,680
-I'll go in first, you--
-Bottoms up!

405
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,727
-Damn it, just hold this.
-What?

406
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,606
My goodness. Hello.

407
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,568
-What is it?
-Well…

408
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,862
Don't drink that.

409
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,990
He drugged the drinks.

410
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,493
-Drugs?
-No way. What's he saying?

411
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:29,494
No, I didn't, wait…

412
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,207
Bye.

413
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:39,587
Here's your fruit platter.
This one's on the house.

414
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,130
-Enjoy!
-Have fun.

415
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,132
Fucking hell.

416
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,719
Who the hell are you?

417
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:50,682
You guys said you'd turn a blind eye.

418
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:53,476
You sold me the drugs,
so why the hell are you interfering?

419
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,853
-What do we do?
-Hey.

420
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,312
What do we do?

421
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,734
-I'm sorry.
-Yes, I'm sorry.

422
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:06,114
He's new, he doesn't know how things work.

423
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,574
I'm sorry, sir.

424
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:11,452
I'll bring over women who are even hotter.

425
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,745
Just give me a minute.

426
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,539
-Please wait.
-Yes.

427
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:15,623
Stop.

428
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,584
Where are you going?

429
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,961
Call them over from here.

430
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,254
From here?

431
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,548
-Okay.
-They're awfully suspicious.

432
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,842
-You two call the club manager.
-Okay.

433
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:30,138
We're calling them.

434
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:31,806
Hye-jun.

435
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,932
MANAGER RUBY

436
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:37,145
Yes. I'm a bit busy,
I can't talk right now.

437
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:42,567
I'm talking to your boss right now,
so call me back later.

438
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,738
You know Gu Tae-su, don't you?

439
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:49,741
I really can't say I do.

440
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,118
Damn it.

441
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,330
Hey, boss man. You're next.

442
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,499
I do. I know who he is.

443
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,211
-You do?
-Yes.

444
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:05,548
Who the fuck laid a hand
on my little brother? Was it you?

445
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,091
She's smoking!

446
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:09,218
-Yes, I like this.
-Hye-jun.

447
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,264
Prosecutor Cha.
Your nose is bleeding. Are you okay?

448
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,643
Yes. I'm fine.

449
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:21,105
But they were trying to drug women and…

450
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,484
What? Drug them?

451
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,750
You assholes.

452
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,650
-What are you doing hiding here?
-Water.

453
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:07,819
-Water?
-Water.

454
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,278
Okay.

455
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,781
Why were you hiding out here to eat?

456
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:16,369
I'm telling you. This is huge.

457
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:18,871
I don't care if it's huge,

458
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:21,040
we've got a Narcotics
Investigation Division.

459
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,793
Why would you guys raid a club?

460
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:27,130
Lieutenant Han was
secretly on Gu Tae-su's trail

461
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:29,966
and ended right up at N. Joy club.

462
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,342
And there she found

463
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:35,972
evidence of narcotics trafficking.

464
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:38,099
This is huge.

465
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,435
You just won the lottery.

466
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:45,857
This isn't a cause of celebration,
it's a ticking time bomb.

467
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,483
-Come on.
-Water.

468
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,818
-Right. Water.
-Water.

469
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,321
Just give us the necessary backup,

470
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,574
and we'll wipe out an entire drug cartel.

471
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:55,825
I'll make sure

472
00:33:56,451 --> 00:34:00,163
to wrap this case up all clean and pretty

473
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:03,791
and send you to the headquarters.

474
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:07,712
This isn't a guess or conjecture, right?

475
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,589
You have solid proof?

476
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,717
I'm a million percent sure.

477
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:16,763
Lieutenant Han has all the evidence
and witnesses rounded up

478
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,723
and is waiting for us.

479
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,187
Headquarters.

480
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,481
Headquarters?

481
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:27,732
Yes.

482
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:28,691
Headquarters?

483
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,693
Right to the headquarters.

484
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,279
-Right to it?
-Right to it.

485
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,531
Fantastic.

486
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:43,039
It is a pretty name for a drug. "Ruby."

487
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:46,334
So you're saying this drug, "Ruby",
was sold at the club,

488
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,586
and Gu Tae-su managed the operations?

489
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:50,963
We need to find the ledger
that Gu Tae-su kept.

490
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,591
That ledger would be clear proof

491
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:57,136
that they paid the dividends
with the money from the drug trafficking.

492
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,264
Where is it? Did you find it too?

493
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,349
Yes.

494
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,278
So the ledger is in a hidden safe

495
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,613
on the top floor.

496
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:20,118
But it won't be easy to crack into
if it's an older model…

497
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,369
Then how do we open it?

498
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:23,538
Well,

499
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:27,250
then Su-cheol will have
to bring out the whole thing.

500
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:31,420
What? Come on.
Who knows how big it might be?

501
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,297
We don't even know where it exactly is.

502
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,924
Can we even get in?

503
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:37,927
Hacking into the hotel's server is easy.
The problem is the guards.

504
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,929
There are more of them than I thought.

505
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:43,474
Prosecutor Cha and Major Crimes
Division Seven will take care of that.

506
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,517
-What?
-What?

507
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:53,401
I called it in saying
it was under your orders.

508
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:57,488
You two clean up the club
and draw attention,

509
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,031
and we'll go look for the ledger.

510
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:02,660
Couldn't you have told me
before pretending to give orders from me?

511
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,872
So that's why you said
we should wait here.

512
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,791
Well…

513
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,544
The operation is about to start,
aren't you going?

514
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:13,296
Come on, move.

515
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,505
Let's go.

516
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:21,762
-Han.
-Ma'am.

517
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,431
-Hi.
-Prosecutor Cha.

518
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,765
Sorry I couldn't tell you.

519
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,101
Thank you for getting
the Chief's approval, Mr. Jang.

520
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,352
Thank you.

521
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,354
It was nothing. Never mind that.

522
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,982
I boasted to the Chief that we had

523
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:35,526
all the evidence and witnesses rounded up
before I came here.

524
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,404
Are you sure about this?
If this goes wrong, we'll be in trouble.

525
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:39,822
We're sure, so trust us.

526
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:44,493
Well, if you say so too.

527
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,829
-Let's have faith and get in there.
-Okay.

528
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,956
This is my first time, I'm so nervous.

529
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:50,666
Let's go.

530
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:15,524
Charge!

531
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:20,238
Stop them.

532
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,040
-No.
-Move.

533
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:32,917
Gosh, I think I'm drunk.

534
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,587
Mr. Shaman…

535
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:39,382
It is him.

536
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:41,842
It really is Mr. Shaman.

537
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,928
Mr. Shaman.

538
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,390
-Mr. Shaman.
-Mr. Shaman?

539
00:37:57,149 --> 00:38:01,362
This must be a sign from the spirits.
The spirits.

540
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:03,489
-Park Jin-sang.
-Yes.

541
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:06,242
Your father owns this hotel, right?

542
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:07,159
Yes, he does.

543
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,787
Mr. Shaman, I have lots of hotels too.

544
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,039
-Stay out of this.
-Okay.

545
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,795
I came because
the aura around this place felt so dark.

546
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,797
And look at what I find.
A scene like that.

547
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,551
But that's not the end of it.

548
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:28,139
There's ominous energy
coming from the top floor.

549
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:31,350
The top floor? The Royal Floor?

550
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:33,561
Director Gu's
in charge of the Royal Floor.

551
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:39,066
Yes. Mr. Shaman was saying…

552
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:43,154
What was it? That he saw
something that looked like a safe.

553
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:44,238
Yes.

554
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:49,410
The spirits are telling me
that the root of all this evil

555
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,495
lies in a safe on the top floor.

556
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,122
You must get rid of it quickly. If not,

557
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,791
your entire family will be ruined.

558
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:59,462
How do you know about a secret safe,
that even I haven't seen?

559
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:00,379
-Hey.
-What?

560
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:03,299
That's not the point.
He says your family will be ruined.

561
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:05,551
Right, that can't happen.

562
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,680
If you want to save your father,

563
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:12,141
find out where that safe is,
and its password.

564
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:13,100
Okay.

565
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:18,230
My goodness. I pray unto thee.

566
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,523
Yes. Secretary Lee?

567
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:24,320
You need to take the private elevator
to the Royal Floor.

568
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:25,613
But a CCTV control room

569
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,157
has a live feed
of the elevator at all times.

570
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:31,660
The CCTV in the security room
of the Royal Floor is hacked.

571
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,204
You can take the elevator now.

572
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:51,097
I have to pee.

573
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:54,767
Damn it, you idiot. Not again.

574
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:06,362
What the hell? What's happening?

575
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:12,034
Damn it, the hotel's
Wi-Fi is too unstable.

576
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,285
Hurry before they find out.

577
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:14,995
Who are they?

578
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,958
-Hey, are they going up right now?
-Yes.

579
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,126
Follow me.

580
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,382
We have to take the elevator, right?
Hye-jun, just a moment.

581
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:28,467
God, I can't believe this.

582
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:31,637
Where are they?

583
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:40,688
Hey, over there.

584
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:43,941
Damn it.

585
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,026
-Shoot.
-Hey.

586
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:48,946
-Operation Cockroach has failed.
-Okay.

587
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:51,699
I'll do my best to hold them off here.

588
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:52,700
You go ahead.

589
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,954
Will you be okay? There are a lot of them.

590
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:59,123
I'm this close to exploding, but I'm okay.

591
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:00,958
Clench hard. Don't embarrass yourself.

592
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,001
Okay.

593
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:03,794
All right.

594
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,380
Now, come on. Come at me.

595
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:19,977
Hey. You over there. Come here.

596
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,230
Come on. Come here.

597
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,858
Come on, stop moving around.

598
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:29,695
Yes.

599
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:31,947
I'll take the files and go.

600
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:43,459
It's not your mother's birthday
or wedding anniversary.

601
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,295
When did your mother pass away?

602
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:49,131
It's already been--

603
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:50,633
Hurry up. I don't have time.

604
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:52,718
-April 1st.
-Okay.

605
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,768
-Mr. Shaman, did it open?
-Yes, it did.

606
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,895
-Mr. Shaman?
-Okay, I'm hanging up now.

607
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:06,232
-Wait.
-Wait, so…

608
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:07,983
that was it?

609
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:17,701
JOYCE PARTNERS LEDGERS

610
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,374
"Cha Seung-won Inspection Report"?

611
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,376
Why would this be…

612
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:58,450
Gosh.

613
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:01,787
Nam Han-jun.

614
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:05,165
I should have taken care of you earlier…

615
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,920
Please. That again?
Don't give up this time.

616
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:21,640
I'm bleeding…

617
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,350
I make a living on this face, damn it.

618
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,237
Han-jun.

619
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,616
Han-jun, what happened?

620
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:42,453
Oh, no. What happened?
Get up. Are you okay?

621
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:47,416
Gu Tae-su took the files.

622
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:49,668
What? All of them?

623
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,630
I did manage to hide away one.

624
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:53,714
What?

625
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,222
Damn it.

626
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,307
Nice.

627
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:07,144
Old habits do die hard, right?

628
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:09,855
Well done. Nicely done.

629
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:12,775
-Help me up.
-Yes, okay.

630
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:14,777
One, two.

631
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:15,861
Hey.

632
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,155
Gosh.

633
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:21,659
I haven't had the chance to go yet.

634
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:22,993
-Still?
-Yes.

635
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:25,204
Jeez, you really are something.

636
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:34,922
MINAMDANG

637
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:37,424
I can't believe you got hurt again
so soon. Let me see.

638
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,593
Gosh, it hurts.

639
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,512
It hurts.

640
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:45,265
Hey. So, the N. Joy Club

641
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,601
made money by selling Ruby,

642
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,104
and used the money to do, what was it?

643
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:52,147
-The Shovel of Sinmyeong.
-Yes, that.

644
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,899
They used the money for that, and…

645
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,276
Damn it, what a headache.

646
00:44:57,277 --> 00:45:00,406
So what does this all mean?

647
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:03,909
I don't have to listen to this, right?

648
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:05,285
Go on.

649
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,453
Kids.

650
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:09,790
I'm only going to tell you this once,
so listen up.

651
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:11,458
Okay.

652
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:16,964
The cartel, which Auntie Im runs,
invested in Joyce Entertainment.

653
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,383
Joyce reinvested the money
into N.Joy Club,

654
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:21,760
Gu Tae-su made money
by selling Ruby there,

655
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:24,263
and gave the cartel members their payouts.

656
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:28,267
They've had a taste now, so they
pester her for an even bigger profit,

657
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:32,521
and Auntie Im planned a bigger project,
the Jakdu-dong land development project.

658
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:34,523
Their victims will be the innocent people

659
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:37,067
who'll buy the apartments,
unaware of the plot afoot,

660
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:40,154
making the cartel rich beyond imagination.

661
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,657
Cha Seung-won is trying
to become the chairman

662
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,701
by ripping off innocent people.

663
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:51,915
I should have taken
Cha Seung-won's inspection report first.

664
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,376
An inspection report? What's that?

665
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,129
I think it's a ledger of their crimes
that Park Dong-gi prepared

666
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:58,755
as a contingency plan.

667
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,633
I found a document about
how Cha sold the Jakdu-dong land

668
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:03,218
for a marked-up price in there.

669
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:05,721
Isn't Choekang doing
the construction for the project?

670
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:07,598
Yes. It's genius.

671
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:10,559
He sells his cheap land
to the government for a higher price,

672
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:14,146
while moving up the construction plan.
They're playing in the big leagues.

673
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:15,939
It's nasty, but also cool.

674
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:19,568
But Gu Tae-su took the file.

675
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:20,903
So who has it now?

676
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,655
Wouldn't he have taken it to Auntie Im?

677
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:26,742
It must be in Gu Tae-su's master's hands.

678
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:29,995
CHA SEUNG-WON INSPECTION REPORT

679
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:47,387
CHAIRMAN PARK DONG-GI

680
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:59,024
The police opened the safe?
But how did they know about it?

681
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:00,734
They stormed in all of a sudden.

682
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:03,654
Thankfully, we managed to save the ledger.

683
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:06,323
What about the files in the safe?
Did you get them all?

684
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:08,200
Yes. I have them with me.

685
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:11,161
Hold on to them.
Don't show them to anyone.

686
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:13,830
You can't let anyone else
get their hands on them.

687
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:15,541
-Okay?
-Yes, sir.

688
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:20,671
He was pretending not to be interested,

689
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:24,341
but he's trying to push me aside
and become the chairman?

690
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,844
CHA SEUNG-WON INSPECTION REPORT

691
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:30,347
What were you two doing

692
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,933
while Uncle was preparing
to stab me in the back?

693
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:38,939
They don't have the evidence yet,

694
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:41,275
but the investigation will begin soon.

695
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:44,653
If they close in on us,
it'll delay our development project.

696
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:45,654
What should we do?

697
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:49,199
We need to hurry.

698
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:54,037
Stoke up a big frenzy about the project
until the groundbreaking ceremony.

699
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,039
Start selling the apartments right after.

700
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,584
We just need the construction fee.

701
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:02,588
We wrote the contract so we'd get
half the fee even if it went bust.

702
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:05,882
We won't lose anything
even if things don't go as planned. No?

703
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:10,178
I'll move up the date for the ceremony
and start the propaganda machine.

704
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:11,597
And one more thing.

705
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:17,477
Take care of Uncle
before the shareholder's meeting.

706
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:25,652
But he's involved
in too many of our projects.

707
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:26,903
If he starts talking--

708
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:44,379
If he can talk,
then he hasn't been taken care of.

709
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:47,174
Didn't we have all of this planned

710
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,176
when we started siphoning off
his assets overseas?

711
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:57,225
Auntie.

712
00:48:57,726 --> 00:49:01,271
I have no interest in what you get up to.

713
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:02,272
But…

714
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:08,362
cause any trouble for my succession,

715
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,782
and that's a whole different story.

716
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:18,580
Yes, sir.

717
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:22,501
I'll deal with Chairman Park.

718
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:31,593
But…

719
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:34,971
I found something odd with the cash flow.

720
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:36,598
Like what?

721
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:38,975
The dividends paid out
to the cartel members used to be

722
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:41,728
invested only in the Jakdu-dong
land development project.

723
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,398
But lately, it's been flowing into
a company called KM Leaders.

724
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:48,360
Hold on. KM Leaders?
There was a file on that in the safe too.

725
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:51,613
I think it's a paper company
Auntie Im established overseas.

726
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:55,534
All of Chairman Park's investment
has been directed into it.

727
00:49:57,577 --> 00:50:01,873
Wow, she's impressive.
I see what she's going for.

728
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,543
She's going to steal the investment

729
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:07,629
for the Jakdu-dong project
through KM Leaders.

730
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:10,298
So Auntie Im is conning the others?

731
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:14,386
She's been feathering the nests
of the cartel members

732
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:16,346
and gaining their trust for this moment.

733
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:19,015
Seeing their blind trust in her,

734
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:20,600
she set up this last con.

735
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:23,687
"Invest in the Jakdu-dong
Land Development Project."

736
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,772
Then you'll all become chaebols.

737
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,024
All of her plans until now have succeeded,

738
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:30,485
so everyone said yes.

739
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:33,238
Not knowing the game was rigged.

740
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:37,451
But now Cha Seung-won knows.

741
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:40,245
You said Park Dong-gi made
a blackmail folder on Cha Seung-won.

742
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:43,290
Doesn't that mean
Auntie Im is in danger now?

743
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:45,917
No. If Cha Seung-won and
Auntie Lim are in it together,

744
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:49,004
they're going to try to get rid of
Park Dong-gi, I'm sure of it.

745
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,809
CHOEKANG INSURANCE

746
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:05,228
They told me Gu Tae-su left with Father,

747
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,438
and his phone is off.

748
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:09,274
The spirits were right.

749
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:11,985
He must have been kidnapped.

750
00:51:12,068 --> 00:51:15,947
My father's okay, right? Nothing's going
to happen to him, right, Mr. Shaman?

751
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,949
If we don't move quickly,
I can't promise you anything.

752
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:22,913
No. This can't be.

753
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:26,958
I haven't had a chance
to be a good son to him yet.

754
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:30,712
Mr. Shaman, please. Save my father.

755
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:32,005
Stop crying.

756
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:34,966
I'm going to look for a way
to get him back safely,

757
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:38,345
so get it together,
stop worrying, and wait.

758
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:43,391
Can you check his recent movements?

759
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:48,104
Shoot, those sneaky weasels.
They've moved to an area without CCTVs.

760
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:52,275
If this is the final round,
he might kill Park Dong-gi and disappear.

761
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:53,485
What should we do?

762
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:56,154
We don't have much time,

763
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:58,365
so let's work on his exact location
on the way.

764
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:00,951
We have to head to where
he was last seen on the CCTVs.

765
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:05,038
After Gu Tae-su kills Park Dong-gi,
Auntie Lim will try to leave the country.

766
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:07,749
Prosecutor Cha,
stop her any way you can. Let's go.

767
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:11,294
Bye now.

768
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:14,130
-Good luck.
-Wait. Am I not going with you?

769
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:23,807
That way.

770
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:25,642
-Hey.
-What?

771
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:29,020
I'd be better in a situation like this.

772
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:30,689
-Let's go.
-Han-jun.

773
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:32,065
What?

774
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:33,483
She's driving?

775
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,151
Yes. What do we do?

776
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:38,572
Wait. Sit in the front. Here, come on.

777
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:40,824
There you go. All safe.

778
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:42,951
-What?
-It'll be fun.

779
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:44,244
Okay.

780
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:49,207
Come on. Do something.

781
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,334
-What do you expect me to do?
-Come on!

782
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:53,712
Right.

783
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:54,880
What?

784
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:57,674
You'd better steel yourself.

785
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,218
Prepare to be

786
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:02,345
excited to death.

787
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,097
Let's go.

788
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:08,393
We're off, then.

789
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,573
Can you figure out
where Gu took Park Dong-gi to?

790
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:23,909
Gu Tae-su isn't like other serial killers.

791
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:34,628
His mind is under Auntie Im's control,

792
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:37,631
and he doesn't choose his victims
and the sites himself.

793
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,466
PARK DONG-GI

794
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,348
He's been under rigorous control.

795
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:54,814
So, where would he take him?

796
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:58,109
To deduce that, we have to consider
both Gu Tae-su's and Auntie Im's MO.

797
00:53:58,193 --> 00:53:59,361
Auntie Im's MO?

798
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:02,822
If this is the last round and
she's going to wrap everything up,

799
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:06,743
she would have picked a place
that holds meaning for Gu Tae-su.

800
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:32,727
That way, Gu Tae-su will never talk,
even if he gets framed for everything.

801
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:37,357
A place that holds meaning for Gu Tae-su…

802
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,859
Arson is Gu Tae-su's trademark.

803
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:43,071
The place where
his identity began to take shape…

804
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:48,660
Where was the house
he killed his father in?

805
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:51,788
It was somewhere in Taekseong. Hold on.

806
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:54,332
Hi, Mr. Jang.
Where is Gu Tae-su's family home?

807
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:56,626
Yes, got it.

808
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,129
Wonhan-dong, Taekseong.

809
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:01,840
Okay. You're all dead now.

810
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:03,008
-What?
-Let's go.

811
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:03,925
Step on it!

812
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:04,944
He's alive.

813
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:25,715
Mr. Gu. Are you really going
to blow up this place?

814
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:30,011
I'll put all my fire into my last flame.

815
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:32,931
Why? Did Auntie Im tell you to do that?

816
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:38,186
To kill yourself in that last fire?

817
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:39,270
Don't move.

818
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,609
I just want to know one thing.

819
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:48,530
All of your loyalty made Auntie Im rich.

820
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,740
But what did you get out of it?

821
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:58,289
Don't you pull your tricks on me.

822
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:00,667
I said I'm going to blow it all up.

823
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:10,635
If it's for him,
sacrificing my life is nothing.

824
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:13,388
I don't know who your master is,

825
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:16,307
but I guess
he doesn't really care about you.

826
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:18,518
Seeing as how he took away
someone dear to you.

827
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:20,895
Kang Eun-hye.

828
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:23,064
You cared for her, didn't you?

829
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:27,694
That's why you gifted her with
the white shoes your mother used to wear.

830
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,119
Come here.

831
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:41,207
They're so pretty.

832
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:42,667
Try them on.

833
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,012
Thank you so much.

834
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:58,641
Auntie Im knew that but didn't care.

835
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:02,979
No. She took away your chance
to atone for your crimes

836
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:04,856
and made you a beast.

837
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:06,524
She must have done the same
to Kang Eun-hye.

838
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:11,029
Even if Auntie Im ordered you to,
if you had really cared for King Eun-hye,

839
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:15,366
you should have protected her.

840
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:21,581
You're not the kid
who couldn't protect his mother anymore.

841
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:24,125
You're a grown man now.
Someone who can protect people.

842
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:44,979
EPILOGUE

843
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:38,157
You must be cursed.

844
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:41,035
Your body is covered in flames.

845
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:49,210
He's like a blackbird.

846
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:52,213
They're black all the same,

847
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:56,551
but one is called a crow
and is considered ominous,

848
00:59:57,218 --> 00:59:59,679
while the other is called a magpie
and is welcomed by all.

849
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:04,183
I don't care if you're cursed.

850
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:07,812
You're now my magpie.

851
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:14,796
A wonderful leader who took
his life to take responsibility

852
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:17,256
for the cancellation of the Jakdu-dong
development project.

853
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,966
Keep mouthing off like that

854
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:20,510
and you might end up dead
like your brother.

855
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:22,011
You murderous bastard!

856
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:25,598
They probably want to play up the media
to boost up sales as much as possible.

857
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:27,642
We need to arrest them
before that happens.

858
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:28,935
I'm going to get to the bottom of it.

859
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:31,979
When I'm allowed to be happy…
I'll tell her then.

860
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:33,022
I'm not going to give up.

861
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:35,441
We'll strike during the ceremony.

862
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:36,943
The gods of heaven and earth!

863
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:40,196
You should stop your evil deeds
and pay for your crimes.

864
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:45,284
