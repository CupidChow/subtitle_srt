00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,123
EPISODE 2

2
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,492
You're leaving me?

3
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,998
You're human, aren't you? Who are you?

4
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,750
Come on down right now!

5
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,085
Looney, you…

6
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:29,339
Yes, you. I will catch you at all costs.

7
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,145
That wasn't fair.

8
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,899
Hey, Looney!

9
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:49,651
Wait until I catch you!

10
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,488
That hurts.

11
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:56,783
Darn it.

12
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:04,707
Judging by the skid mark,
this is where the accident occurred.

13
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,336
How could you tell that?

14
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,338
-The skid mark is so vague.
-No.

15
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:12,924
This is the skill of an experienced cop.

16
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:15,301
Jeez, you're truly amazing.

17
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:16,886
Hey.

18
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,098
You're barking up the wrong tree.
It's over here.

19
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,517
Is it?

20
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,894
I really thought this was it.

21
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,147
-Jeez.
-By the way,

22
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,607
I don't see the victim's bike.

23
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,193
The assailant must have cleaned up
the crime scene.

24
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:35,738
They hid the victim
and got rid of the evidence too?

25
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,032
They really are a grade-A scumbag.

26
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:42,537
-What about the surveillance camera?
-Unfortunately, this is a blind spot.

27
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:47,625
We should check all the vehicles
that drove this way around that time.

28
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,712
DAEUN POLICE STATION

29
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:00,388
What? What's going on?

30
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:01,931
Get up already.

31
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,433
Jeez.

32
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,060
Take it easy.

33
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:09,063
You won't catch them that way anyway.

34
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,315
Stop.

35
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,109
We found the assailant's car.

36
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:14,819
What?

37
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,240
Look up the license plate.

38
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,283
Yes, ma'am.

39
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,330
"Shin Gyeong-ho."

40
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:26,956
"Shin Gyeong-ho."

41
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,499
"Shin Gyeong-ho"?

42
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:34,213
What? Isn't he
the vice-chairman of S&H Group?

43
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,008
Darn it. It's him again?

44
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,468
This isn't his first offense?

45
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,887
He's a notorious scumbag.

46
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,097
He does drugs
and gets violent while drunk.

47
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,432
Despite killing someone,

48
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,684
it was ruled an accident
and he was let go.

49
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,687
He was released when he killed someone?

50
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:53,524
"A woman who was high on drugs
fell over and died."

51
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,318
That's how the case was closed.

52
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,738
He's the root of all my misery.

53
00:03:58,821 --> 00:03:59,864
Unbelievable.

54
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,825
Ms. Han. We hit the jackpot, didn't we?

55
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,452
Her first case is on a conglomerate.

56
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,412
This is amazing.

57
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,082
This is nothing to be happy about.

58
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,459
He'll be let go
before we can even do something.

59
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:15,797
That scumbag
could easily pay his way out of this.

60
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,881
Right.

61
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,884
First, let's find out
who was in the passenger seat.

62
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,512
No…

63
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,556
No!

64
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,600
Don't you know what Sebastian means to me?

65
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,394
Samsong's Kim Do-yong and I

66
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,854
are the only ones
who own that car in this country!

67
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,316
But still, I think
it's a safe bet to scrap it, sir.

68
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,278
Thanks to Sebastian,

69
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,824
I reached 100,000 followers
on my social media page.

70
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:45,827
You're even more
of an idiot than I thought.

71
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:51,791
Who are you?

72
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,835
Who are you to barge in here?

73
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,212
Me?

74
00:04:57,046 --> 00:05:00,341
I'm the special person who will help
your idiot of a vice-chairman

75
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,593
by any means necessary.

76
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:06,180
Shaman Nam Han-jun.

77
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,811
So you're the guy
my wife always visits for advice.

78
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:14,605
Shaman Nam Han-jun from Minamdang.

79
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,942
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

80
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,112
Watch what you say to him.

81
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:24,324
Do as he says if you don't want
to be arrested for attempted murder.

82
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,535
Wait. How did you know about that?

83
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,246
You bastard…

84
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,206
It was Mr. Nam who told me.

85
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,334
You told a shaman about me?

86
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,501
No, sir!

87
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,713
Look at you.

88
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,965
This isn't the first time

89
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,343
you had blood on your hands.

90
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,099
A woman who's bleeding from her head

91
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,686
is following you around and cursing you.

92
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,024
She's following me?

93
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,275
Hold on.

94
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,488
She's cursing me, sir?

95
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,750
Let's see.

96
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,711
Let me spread my wings
and dance on the blade.

97
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,048
Let me perform an exorcism.

98
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,343
I sense a group of spirits.

99
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:28,846
I sense them.

100
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,070
Surname, Shin.

101
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,948
Given name, Gyeong-ho.

102
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,959
What a vile name you have.

103
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:21,065
How dare you?

104
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,863
TWO HOURS AGO

105
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:34,454
The DNA underneath the victim's nails
matched Shin Gyeong-ho's.

106
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,957
But he had an alibi
during her estimated time of death,

107
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,208
so he was acquitted.

108
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:07,361
He walked in through the front door.

109
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:12,909
Then, he put down his glass…

110
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,249
and headed to the bathroom.

111
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,837
His victim's body was already in there.

112
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,090
Her estimated time of death
would've been delayed

113
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,468
if she was drenched in warm water.

114
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:34,555
He probably just wanted
to wash away the evidence.

115
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,141
But thanks to that, he got his alibi.

116
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,062
But all of that happened after the murder.

117
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,660
The photo was taken
three days before the murder…

118
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,207
but the painting and the vase
in his house were replaced.

119
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,005
That means her cause of death was…

120
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,643
Hold on. All right.

121
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,520
Wait. Come here.

122
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,481
Let me go!

123
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,166
You little…

124
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,587
Come here.

125
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,682
She had a fracture
to the left of her skull.

126
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,435
But he's right-handed.

127
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:09,150
I finally found out how he murdered her.

128
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,076
While holding a vase in your right hand,

129
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,329
you killed her
while choking her with your left.

130
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,923
She remembers it vividly.

131
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,095
Like this!

132
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:42,600
You hit her to death
with a vase while choking her!

133
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:43,976
Like so!

134
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,234
Wow.

135
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:00,868
Even the cops don't know that.

136
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,119
Unbelievable.

137
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,789
No way. I'm getting goosebumps.

138
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:08,751
Sir, the general stockholders' meeting
is around the corner.

139
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,336
If he gets arrested before that--

140
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,213
His glass is already quite full.

141
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,715
I'm sorry?

142
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,259
This is his final drop.

143
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,803
I don't understand.

144
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,055
I can prevent this misfortune,

145
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,891
but this is the last time.

146
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,352
Do something bad again,

147
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,230
and your glass will overflow.

148
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,817
All of his past deeds
will come back as a huge misfortune.

149
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,984
If that happens,

150
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,487
even I won't be able to help.

151
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:39,865
What will you do?

152
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,742
I'll cast away that misfortune

153
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:42,827
if you can stop here.

154
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:46,705
If not, turn yourself in.
That's your only lifeline.

155
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,042
Come on. Answer him.

156
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,419
Yes, sir.

157
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,337
I'll keep out of trouble from now on.

158
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:56,298
If you can spare me this once,

159
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,843
I'll do anything you tell me to!

160
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,970
What's gotten into you?

161
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:03,889
Fine.

162
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:06,725
I'll make sure you don't even go to court.

163
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,437
Where is the car you drove?

164
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,065
Bring the car and the dashcam to me
before the police find them.

165
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:14,859
This instant.

166
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,610
NAM HAN-JUN, AGE 33

167
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,533
How about we search and seize his car?

168
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,910
Do you think he'd still have it?

169
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,328
He probably scrapped it.

170
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,748
Why do you always do that?
You're so pessimistic.

171
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,375
Let's locate the car first.

172
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,170
It's a unique car,
so I'm sure someone's seen it.

173
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:37,381
This is like looking for
a needle in a haystack.

174
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,633
Where would we go to look for the car?

175
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,679
It's not like someone will come to us

176
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:46,182
and say "Here's his car, your majesty."

177
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,773
Daeun Police Station,
Major Crimes Divison Seven--

178
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,692
Sorry?

179
00:12:58,652 --> 00:12:59,862
I think we found the car.

180
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,156
It's the junkyard.

181
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,492
They're saying that they found
the car we're looking for.

182
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:05,659
Yes.

183
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,662
Okay. We're on our way. Goodbye.

184
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,334
I'll request a search and seizure warrant.

185
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,753
What's the point of requesting one?

186
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:17,171
They won't issue it.

187
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:21,050
You're right. Darn it.

188
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:24,553
Can't anyone issue us a warrant
without being scared of conglomerates?

189
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,555
-Isn't there?
-There isn't.

190
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:28,307
Darn it.

191
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,351
I do know someone.

192
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,603
Who is it?

193
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,649
Prosecutor Cha Do-won.

194
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,154
The chatterbox of the Seoul
Western District Prosecutors' Office?

195
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,948
That Cha Do-won?

196
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,828
I've told you everything I know.

197
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:54,083
I won't admit to it
whatever you have to say to me.

198
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,170
So, you say…

199
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:05,803
All right. There's a possibility
that I could have overlooked some parts.

200
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,472
Then let's start all over again.

201
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:09,932
What?

202
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:21,110
Are we seriously going over all of them?

203
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,279
Well…

204
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,030
Not really.

205
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,460
Thank you.

206
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:42,756
That little…

207
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,927
Did you see him rolling up his sleeves?

208
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,930
The chatterbox has powered itself on.

209
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:53,017
I can't believe there are people
who still don't know about him.

210
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,393
I know.

211
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,022
YEO CHUN-PAL INVESTIGATION REPORT

212
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:04,695
Let's see.

213
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,447
Let's go back 22 years.

214
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,491
"Twenty-two years"?

215
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,826
Mr. Yeo Chun-pal.

216
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,495
To avoid getting caught,
you stowed away to Manila

217
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,539
twenty-two years ago.

218
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,959
22 YEARS AGO

219
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,295
That's right. I did.

220
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,881
And that's where I met Kim Tae-hyeon--

221
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,925
Wait. Let's just talk about the case.

222
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,052
This is related to the case.

223
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:31,639
He's considered the father
of voice phishing scams.

224
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:32,932
-But he--
-No.

225
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,021
Voice phishing started over a century ago.

226
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,230
100 YEARS AGO

227
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:44,318
It existed when telephones came in
at the end of the Joseon Dynasty.

228
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:45,945
I see.

229
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:50,532
"This is the palace. Bring 170 won's worth
of gold hairpins and rings

230
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,909
for Her Majesty."

231
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,994
There were many reported cases

232
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,622
of the individuals disappearing
after receiving the jewelry.

233
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,582
There was also a man

234
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,626
who impersonated his brother
to steal his salary.

235
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,962
And he was wired a hefty sum of 8,000 won.

236
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,546
That's worth 100 million won now.

237
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,715
He called the bank and said
that his brother will pick up the money.

238
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:11,387
You could say scammers back then
were also terrific actors.

239
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,391
My god!

240
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,267
They even coined
a word for these scammers.

241
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,436
They could locate the caller
with the switchboard.

242
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:24,900
That was when voice phishing
first began in Korea.

243
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,735
Fascinating, right?

244
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,613
84 YEARS AGO

245
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,740
76 YEARS AGO

246
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,617
53 YEARS AGO

247
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,120
22 YEARS AGO

248
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,621
3 YEARS AGO

249
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,872
Mr. Yeo.

250
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:42,042
I've analyzed the fake
suspension of transaction form

251
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,293
that you signed in Busan.

252
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,379
It was stamped in a different spot.

253
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:46,380
Sir.

254
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:49,133
Why does it matter
where on the paper it was stamped?

255
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,428
I was wrong. I admit to everything.

256
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,680
So please send me back
to the penitentiary.

257
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,974
You're making my ears bleed.

258
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,183
Well…

259
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,186
Sure. But…

260
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:03,772
Excuse me.

261
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,154
It's been a while, Lieutenant Han.

262
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,363
Hello.

263
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,200
I'd like to ask you for a favor.

264
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,953
What is this? Are you soliciting?

265
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,915
Not at all. We have enough proof,

266
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:26,378
but we're dealing with
S&H Group's Shin Gyeong-ho.

267
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,921
"Shin Gyeong-ho…"

268
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,137
-I'll be back.
-Sir.

269
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,306
Can I go now?

270
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:40,642
We just did a rough review.

271
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,144
We'll dig deeper when I return.

272
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,021
Dig deeper? Sir, dig deeper?

273
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:47,357
Does that mean
we haven't even started yet?

274
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,110
Unbelievable.

275
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,114
We haven't even begun.

276
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,038
I'm bleeding.

277
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:03,665
No way! My ear is bleeding!

278
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:07,377
We'll send you the evidence
and the report we received.

279
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:08,796
Thank you, sir.

280
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,888
He'll look through it
and issue a warrant right away.

281
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:19,723
Seriously?

282
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,226
We're really getting

283
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,436
a warrant?

284
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,403
We're not dreaming, are we?

285
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,030
We have to move quickly.

286
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,699
They'll find out about the warrant
as soon as it's issued.

287
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,284
We need to make a move first.

288
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,248
What is it?

289
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,127
Is it your first time seeing
such a passionate cop?

290
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,712
I'm not doing this to help you.

291
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,048
I just want to catch that scumbag,
Shin Gyeong-ho.

292
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,801
I see. You haven't accepted me yet

293
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,512
but you still want to catch him, right?

294
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,308
Does she really have to ask?

295
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:05,227
Detective Na.

296
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,980
We'll head out, so let me know
once the warrant is issued.

297
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,773
-Yes, ma'am.
-Let's go.

298
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:10,983
All right.

299
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,569
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

300
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,789
The clumsy, youngest cop
is all by himself.

301
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,127
NAME: SHIN GYEONG-HO
CRIME: HIT-AND-RUN

302
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:34,131
You need to get there
before it's issued. Hurry.

303
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,133
It's 10:30 a.m.

304
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,759
You have five minutes.

305
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,431
We're headed there
with the tow truck driver.

306
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,684
Okay.

307
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,232
-Did he just go in?
-Yes.

308
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,368
Fuck! Are you serious?

309
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,454
It's right in front of you!

310
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,748
This is so infuriating.

311
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:13,754
ARREST WARRANT

312
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,433
FAX SENT

313
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,311
Excuse me.

314
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,229
Yes?

315
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,023
-Major Crimes Division Seven?
-Yes.

316
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,777
This is the dashcam for 58 J 1999.

317
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,488
The junkyard owner said
I should give this to you.

318
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,157
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

319
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,784
-Thank you!
-No problem.

320
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,621
It's 10:35 a.m.
The warrant isn't issued yet.

321
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,219
All we did was throw the bait.

322
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:05,889
And he just took it.

323
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,767
-He has no idea.
-He has no idea.

324
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,811
We fooled him, all right.

325
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,771
Let's go.

326
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,528
I'm telling you.
The proof came through the door.

327
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,863
I'm dying to watch this,
so please hurry back.

328
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,198
Yes, ma'am.

329
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:27,244
THE SEARCH AND SEIZURE WARRANT
HAS BEEN ISSUED

330
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,248
What a lunatic.

331
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:34,209
Damn. Shin Gyeong-ho, you scumbag.

332
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,169
He squirmed his way out last time,

333
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,005
but we have hard evidence now.

334
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,799
Let me be the one to cuff him, sir.

335
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,524
Let's be patient.

336
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,651
May the law bless you.

337
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:00,861
Shin Gyeong-ho.

338
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,656
I'll repay you
for the humiliation you gave me.

339
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,410
Let's raid his house
as soon as we get the warrant.

340
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:09,494
All right.

341
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:18,920
Yes?

342
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,381
Hey, have you gone crazy?

343
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,716
You're after Shin Gyeong-ho?

344
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,676
I told you to keep her in check
and now you're helping her?

345
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,802
Hello?

346
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:27,763
This is the police--

347
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,140
-Hello? I can't hear you.
-Hey.

348
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:32,309
Do you think that will fool me?

349
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,769
Stop it!

350
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,604
Chief, I--

351
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,273
Oh, dear. It's out of battery.

352
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:40,442
Jeez. I should charge it.

353
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,528
Was that the chief?

354
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,531
Don't be ridiculous. It was a spam call.

355
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,785
They're really serious
about loan recommendations.

356
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,620
How did they know I needed money?

357
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:56,708
Okay. Let's go.

358
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:01,755
Let's go. Those scumbags.

359
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,764
Please, step aside.

360
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:13,725
Or we'll arrest you all
for obstruction of justice.

361
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:16,603
-Let's go.
-Stop them!

362
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,355
-Let me go.
-You can't enter.

363
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:19,940
-Come on.
-Let me go!

364
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:21,233
-Please stop.
-You can't enter.

365
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,526
-Move aside!
-Darn it.

366
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:23,777
-Darn it.
-Don't touch me.

367
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,695
-Here he comes.
-Hey.

368
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,405
-Move.
-Move.

369
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,493
He volunteered to go with you.

370
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,078
Will you come to the station with us?

371
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:36,331
Are you deaf? Didn't you hear him?

372
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:37,332
Lead the way.

373
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,507
I think I've seen you before.

374
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,551
Are you still a cop?

375
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,512
I'm so happy to see you again.

376
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,475
-You little--
-Stop.

377
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,686
-Gosh.
-He startled me.

378
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,312
Mr. Shin Gyeong-ho.

379
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:00,814
You're under arrest

380
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:03,942
for failing to tend
to an accident and fleeing.

381
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:07,154
You have the right to an attorney
and you'll be given the chance to speak.

382
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,781
You may also request to have
the legality of your arrest reviewed.

383
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,032
What is she saying?

384
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,618
-Yes, ma'am.
-What's going on?

385
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:14,828
-What is this?
-Move.

386
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,831
Why are you cuffing me
when I agreed to go willingly?

387
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,709
That fucking hurts! Be gentle.

388
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,127
Don't curse.

389
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,838
Why are you cuffing him
when he's willing to go?

390
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:26,173
Hey.

391
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:29,050
We didn't come all the way here
just to give you the warrant.

392
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:30,677
-Take him.
-Yes, sir.

393
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,429
Wait. Hold on.

394
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,847
Mr. Choi!

395
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,223
Mr. Choi!

396
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,558
-Mr. Shaman!
-Come here.

397
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,226
Darn it! Mr. Shaman!

398
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,854
Look confident on your way
to the police station.

399
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,731
You're acting like
you've done something bad.

400
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,275
Just go there and keep your mouth shut.

401
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,152
You'll be released soon.

402
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,322
We have hard evidence,
so I doubt that'll happen.

403
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:51,865
I don't know about that.

404
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:54,576
You may need better evidence.

405
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,748
-It's freezing.
-Come on.

406
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:02,667
Darn it.

407
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,341
What are you doing here?

408
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,176
Client management.

409
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:14,095
Don't tell me
Shin Gyeong-ho is your client.

410
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,139
He's a VVIP conglomerate client.

411
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,893
But you're the one
who reported the hit-and-run case.

412
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,478
That's also a part of client management.

413
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:23,772
Attempted murder
is easier to solve than murder.

414
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:27,234
Do you not care who your clients are
as long as they have money?

415
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:30,153
-Aren't you embarrassed?
-Jeez.

416
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,863
Embarrassed in front of whom?

417
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,281
You?

418
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,744
You're more of a bastard than I thought.

419
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:40,538
I don't know what you're scheming,

420
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:44,167
but you won't get your way
because I'll get to the bottom of this!

421
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:56,179
I knew it.

422
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,306
The stalker who threw a shoe at me…

423
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,599
It was you, wasn't it?

424
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,477
Me? A stalker?

425
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,396
Do you have proof?

426
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:08,566
Jeez. It really must be you,
seeing how you're demanding proof.

427
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,943
What did you say?

428
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:13,655
I get that you're head over heels for me.

429
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,115
It's true that I'm charming.

430
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:19,577
However, I'm not good boyfriend material.

431
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:20,704
So forget about me--

432
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,622
I told you that's not it!

433
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:25,500
Hey.

434
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:37,554
What was that?

435
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:44,311
Han-jun, are you crying? Why?

436
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:49,316
I've hurt another naive girl once again.

437
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,985
Why am I so sexy?

438
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:55,530
Why do I have this
attractive and deadly charm?

439
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,949
More like a deadly illness.

440
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:01,494
It's very deadly.
It's going to be the death of you.

441
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:07,834
Hey, did you call Jung Cheong-gi?

442
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,295
Yes. There he is.

443
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:13,298
I'll call you
once the meeting's over. Goodbye.

444
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,095
Internal Inspector Jung Cheong-gi?

445
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,638
Thank you for coming.

446
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:22,140
Please.

447
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:26,394
JUNG CHEONG-GI, INTERNAL INSPECTOR
OF THE NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

448
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:42,285
I thought the vice-chairman
wanted to see me face to face.

449
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,287
I guess you haven't heard.

450
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,752
S&H VICE-CHAIRMAN
ARRESTED FOR HIT-AND-RUN

451
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:55,298
I'm well aware that you took great care
of his previous case.

452
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:08,144
1 YEAR AGO

453
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:10,647
Sir. This isn't right.

454
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:13,316
This is a murder case.

455
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:14,651
Gosh.

456
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:17,946
We're talking about Shin Gyeong-ho
of S&H Group here.

457
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,906
Even the prosecution is powerless.

458
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:23,159
Everyone will make sure
he gets acquitted even if he stands trial.

459
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,869
When that happens,

460
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:26,871
what about us?

461
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,706
Don't you think they'll come after us?

462
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,833
But, sir…

463
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:33,920
Jong-man. Let's not do this, okay?

464
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:35,797
Fabricating evidence?

465
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,507
This isn't our first rodeo anyway.

466
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,361
If this pans out, you'll be getting

467
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,572
double the amount you just received.

468
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,991
TOTAL BALANCE
$1,012,365

469
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,119
All right.

470
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,289
How can I help you?

471
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:15,754
You will receive orders
from our CEO, Ms. Lee Min-gyeong.

472
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,394
That's your car, isn't it?

473
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:34,939
And you abandoned it after the accident.

474
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,525
Why would I abandon Sebastian?

475
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,818
It was stolen from me.

476
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:42,947
It must have broken your heart
to see Sebastian in pieces.

477
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,618
Jeez. That's quite a collision.

478
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:49,746
I bet the repair will cost a fortune.

479
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:52,499
Look at the driver getting out of the car.

480
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,593
That's obviously you.

481
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:04,844
Am I wrong?

482
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:08,681
You must use an expensive dashcam.

483
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:11,309
You could use that as your passport photo.

484
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,813
Mr. Shin Gyeong-ho.

485
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:18,191
Your status has been changed
from a suspect to a perpetrator.

486
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:20,860
What?

487
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,570
Am I being locked up?

488
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,740
This isn't what the shaman told me.

489
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:26,866
You're right.

490
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,287
Excuse me.

491
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,998
Ma'am, I think you guys need to come out.

492
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,952
It may be because Korea
is known for its etiquette,

493
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,580
our law sure knows not to cross the line.

494
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:17,834
Any evidence obtained
through illegal means

495
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:20,128
is considered invalid.

496
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,549
How could it be illegal
when we had a warrant issued?

497
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:27,302
You got that dashcam video
before the warrant was issued.

498
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,513
No, it was after that.

499
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,516
What? That's not what I heard.

500
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:40,023
How do you even know
exactly when we received the warrant?

501
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:43,651
A spirit told me.

502
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,989
There's a spirit
that follows your team around.

503
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,949
If not, how would I know that?

504
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:53,870
What do you say?
Should I ask who received it?

505
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:06,341
What?

506
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,884
Who was it?

507
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,479
It was you.

508
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,612
You got it
before the warrant came out, right?

509
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:31,824
I don't quite remember.

510
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,827
Investigations are all about timing.

511
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:38,289
I see a surveillance camera there.

512
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:41,000
Let's see what time
you received the footage.

513
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:44,587
Right?

514
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,644
Darn it.

515
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,692
He got it at 10:35 a.m.

516
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,568
And when was the warrant issued?

517
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,363
WARRANT ISSUE STATUS

518
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:13,533
TIME OF ISSUE

519
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:23,543
It was 10:36 a.m.!

520
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:28,089
The tow truck driver
should have come a minute later.

521
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,092
What a shame.

522
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,264
All right.

523
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:40,476
Do you all admit
to violating the warrant requirement?

524
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:49,193
What will happen now?

525
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,405
Do I have to spell it out for you?

526
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:54,574
It'll be considered illegal evidence.

527
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:58,953
Excuse me, gentlemen.

528
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:03,332
Please. Could you uncuff him now?

529
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,295
He's more competent than most law firms.

530
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,714
Go on and uncuff me.

531
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,351
God damn it. I can't bear to watch this.

532
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,979
Same here.

533
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:28,733
The police in Korea are incompetent

534
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:30,735
because of poor human rights.

535
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:34,072
They should hire more people
and give them some time to study the law.

536
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,657
That way, they won't make
stupid mistakes like this.

537
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,076
You son of a…

538
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:39,744
Don't.

539
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:42,455
-My heart breaks for you guys.
-Damn it!

540
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:43,706
Unbelievable.

541
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,337
That little…

542
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:54,967
Don't get ahead of yourself since
we'll be seeing each other again soon.

543
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,179
Come on, don't say that.

544
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:03,476
All right, then. I hope you continue

545
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,978
to work hard to no avail.

546
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:16,948
Bye.

547
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:30,586
Damn it.

548
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,675
-Bring the car.
-Yes, sir.

549
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:37,426
Mr. Shaman.

550
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,930
You truly are competent.

551
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:43,099
I'll repay your kindness

552
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:46,644
with a hefty payment.

553
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:53,526
How dare you run your mouth
when you should be groveling at my feet?

554
00:35:56,863 --> 00:36:00,283
Have you ever thought
about what the victims went through?

555
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:04,036
Didn't I warn you
to keep that mouth shut and lie low

556
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,539
unless you wanted to know
what it's like to suffer?

557
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:15,756
I won't be able to help you next time,

558
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,884
so quit being arrogant

559
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,635
and help your victims instead.

560
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:21,554
Got that?

561
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:42,742
Gosh, I should start going to a church
or a Buddhist temple.

562
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,581
That little…

563
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:50,416
Hey. Wait. Stop right there!

564
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,045
Du-jin.

565
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:58,049
I'm going to kill
that scumbag today and quit my job.

566
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:59,634
You do that.

567
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:03,304
I'm going to quit monitoring Ms. Han

568
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:06,140
and look for a different line of work
like my father wanted.

569
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,017
Jeez.

570
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:18,569
Du-jin, I think a chill
just ran down my spine.

571
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,404
That wasn't a chill.

572
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,698
That was bloodthirsty rage.

573
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:40,675
What is this?

574
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,593
You startled me!

575
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,764
That's right. It was you.

576
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:50,226
You have the same aura
that the stalker had.

577
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:51,686
Shut up!

578
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,604
Shin Gyeong-ho's victim

579
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,315
is a breadwinner and a father of two kids.

580
00:37:57,149 --> 00:38:00,236
His baby just turned one,
but the victim is still unconscious.

581
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,114
Had he been taken
to a hospital immediately,

582
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:04,824
he would have recovered already.

583
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,829
And why are you telling me this?

584
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,707
I have one question.

585
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,500
That dashcam video.

586
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:17,795
Did you send it to us
to get him out of this?

587
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:20,256
Me? Of course not.

588
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,597
Fine!

589
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,641
I sent it. It was me.

590
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,894
But nonetheless, you're the ones at fault.

591
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,938
You're the ones
who didn't play by the book.

592
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,274
Why are you doing this?

593
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:39,525
Is it money?

594
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:41,694
Who doesn't like money?

595
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:43,529
Why can't I live chasing my base desire?

596
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,592
Did someone send you here as revenge?

597
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,135
-No.
-Then?

598
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:07,845
I heard you wanted to become a cop

599
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:09,096
so I came to teach you a lesson.

600
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:13,142
A true cop isn't someone
who beats up neighborhood thugs.

601
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:15,019
It's someone who knows how to love people.

602
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,147
Look. I was doing it for justice.

603
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,193
If that's what you think,
I can't go easy on you.

604
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:24,528
Look who's talking.

605
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,697
I won't go easy on you
just because you'll be my senior.

606
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,866
I don't care if you're older than me.

607
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:30,576
I won't go easy on you either.

608
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:39,960
I'm going to beat him.

609
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:23,921
You lost, but that was incredible.

610
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:36,267
A true cop protects
both civilians and criminals

611
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,144
within the law.

612
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,313
After all, we are the people
who enforce the law.

613
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,485
Got that, Ms. Little Police?

614
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,929
I can't believe I…

615
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:25,816
Jeez.

616
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:28,652
Snap out of it, Nam Han-jun.

617
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,613
You were a cop once.

618
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,740
You said a true cop

619
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:35,951
is someone who protects both civilians
and criminals within the law.

620
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,871
Then shouldn't the victims
get their justice?

621
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,789
You shouldn't have hurt others!

622
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,543
Listen up.

623
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,838
Do this one more time,

624
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:50,299
and I'll arrest you myself.

625
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:53,177
I'd rather crush you myself

626
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,471
than see you end up…

627
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,266
being arrested by someone else.

628
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:01,769
Darn it.

629
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,528
My goodness.

630
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:13,572
Are you okay? Did I hear her correctly?

631
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:16,158
Didn't she just threaten to crush you?

632
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:20,913
Her distorted affection
has now turned into loathing.

633
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:22,206
Jeez.

634
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:29,797
Su-cheol, help me up.

635
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,550
Kong Su-cheol. Gosh, my back.

636
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,343
SHIN GYEONG-HO OF S&H RELEASED
DUE TO POLICE MISTAKE

637
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:37,846
Did you see that? I give you my thumbs up.

638
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:39,890
I'm sorry, sir.

639
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,935
An apology won't cut it.

640
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:46,647
Listen. The disciplinary committee
will be summoned soon.

641
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,773
Lie low until--

642
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:50,901
I admit there was a mistake,
but we're certain he's our guy.

643
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:55,030
Give us more time
and we promise to arrest him again.

644
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:58,784
How can you say that after what you did?

645
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:02,162
What is it? Are you going to run wild
and humiliate us once again?

646
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:04,623
Why do you think you became a team leader

647
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:06,959
when you were merely
a lieutenant of three years?

648
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:08,669
Because your team was competent

649
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,546
and needed to solve a huge case?

650
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:12,339
You're completely wrong.

651
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,425
Your team rates the lowest in performance

652
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,343
and will be disbanded soon.

653
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:18,429
So, that's why

654
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:21,223
you shouldn't even
dream about catching him.

655
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:22,516
Shin Gyeong-ho

656
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:24,476
should be arrested.

657
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,230
-Hello, sir.
-What is it?

658
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:29,815
We must arrest him.

659
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:33,319
If we don't, there will be trouble.

660
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:35,904
Hey, what do you mean?

661
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:37,906
Think about it, sir.

662
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:42,244
The media is already ridiculing us
for being incompetent.

663
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,955
Do you really think
he will turn over a new leaf?

664
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:46,582
No.

665
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:49,418
No. Not at all. Don't you agree?

666
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:53,797
That's right. He'll think we're a joke
and do something even worse.

667
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:56,175
He'll be bolder next time around.

668
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:58,135
What will happen then?

669
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:00,429
They'll ask us why we can't catch him

670
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:02,931
and ask us why we didn't
keep him locked up earlier.

671
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:05,643
Who do you think
will be held responsible then?

672
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:06,977
It's you.

673
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:12,191
-Me?
-Yes.

674
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:15,069
That can't happen.

675
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:16,945
-Of course, not.
-Never.

676
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:19,490
Hey, you better catch him.

677
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:21,659
Arrest him at all costs!

678
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:24,203
You'll both be sacked if you don't.

679
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:26,538
Yes, sir. We will catch him at all costs.

680
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,165
-Good.
-Sacked?

681
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:30,250
-You will be!
-Yes, sir.

682
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:32,419
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

683
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,755
Catch him. Go on.

684
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:37,007
-Yes, sir.
-Goodness.

685
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:39,927
Hey.

686
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,054
I'll be okay, right?

687
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:44,139
-You can do it!
-I can do it!

688
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:45,224
That's right.

689
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:47,768
Gosh.

690
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:52,564
I don't deserve to be a detective.

691
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,983
I'm nothing but a nuisance.

692
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:57,820
We lost the criminal because of me.

693
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,698
Gwang-tae.

694
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,911
When I was a newbie,
I also made tons of mistakes.

695
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:08,080
Du-jin gave me an earful.

696
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:09,706
-Really?
-Yes.

697
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,083
Leave him be.

698
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:14,253
He's free to leave if he's not up for it.

699
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:17,589
I should've listened to my mom.
I shouldn't have joined Major Crimes.

700
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:20,426
Hold on.

701
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:21,885
Hey.

702
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:26,181
Why are you taking our property
when you're quitting?

703
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:27,891
Arrest him.

704
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:32,563
I can't believe this.
None of this is yours.

705
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:33,814
Come here.

706
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,274
You scumbag.

707
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:36,942
Just let me go.

708
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:39,528
-I don't deserve to be here.
-You little…

709
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:41,738
How dare you try to squirm out of this?

710
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,950
Ms. Han. Come on, you guys.

711
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:46,994
You're no cop. You're a thief.

712
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:51,999
You'll probably be put behind bars
for about 1.5 years, right?

713
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:54,042
-Right.
-Did you hear that?

714
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:57,671
You better not try
to run away in that span of time.

715
00:45:57,754 --> 00:45:59,298
I'm sorry, ma'am.

716
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:03,844
If you really mean it,
stay and help us catch him.

717
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:10,017
Guys… I'm sorry!

718
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:11,727
I really am!

719
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:14,730
All right.

720
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,274
Let's catch him once again

721
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:20,152
and save face.

722
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:21,153
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

723
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:25,574
Even the shaman
said springtime would return.

724
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:31,830
-There he is.
-There.

725
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:33,707
-Sir!
-Sir!

726
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:36,627
-Please tell us what happened!
-How did it go?

727
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,003
What will happen now?

728
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:40,297
-Did you reach a settlement?
-Tell us!

729
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,883
DAEUN POLICE STATION

730
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,092
That little…

731
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:46,512
Winter never lasts forever.

732
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:49,097
Spring always comes around once again.

733
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:51,850
What are you rambling on about?

734
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:57,147
It's better to get a hen tomorrow
than an egg today.

735
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:02,277
Don't be so upset
just because you didn't get a hen today.

736
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:05,656
He's declaring war.

737
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:08,283
You're right. This is war.

738
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:11,286
"Your hard work will be futile."

739
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,247
"We're going to squirm out of it again."

740
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,582
"Step back since you're no match for me."

741
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,084
That's what he's saying.

742
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,377
Is that so?

743
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,295
I thought he meant our time would come.

744
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:21,797
-No!
-No!

745
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,090
He's taunting us.

746
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:25,217
I didn't know he was such an asshole.

747
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:29,012
Shaman, my foot.
Don't let that fraud deceive you.

748
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:31,640
Of course. After all, we're the police.

749
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:33,433
Let's stand our ground.

750
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,686
That woman who was in the passenger seat…

751
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:36,853
Min Yu-seon.

752
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:39,314
How about we ask her to testify?

753
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:41,358
Yes. Let's go.

754
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:45,070
I've already located her address
thanks to the help of my cousin's son

755
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:47,656
who works at a district office.

756
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:49,700
-Let's go.
-All right.

757
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:58,792
I thought they were like cats and dogs,
but they're like fire and oil.

758
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:02,629
No wonder the police hate your guts.

759
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:08,051
They probably want your head on a stake.

760
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:10,429
No way.

761
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:13,640
Were you the one
who screwed over that female cop?

762
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,935
Yes. Han-jun will need
to run away with all his might now.

763
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:20,230
-Will you let them do this?
-Or what?

764
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:23,191
You don't like being indebted.
Will you let her be punished?

765
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:26,695
Whatever. I don't want to get involved.

766
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,405
Leave her!

767
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:31,992
You don't want to get involved?

768
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:33,452
Stop that.

769
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:35,954
How suspicious.

770
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:37,998
-Su-cheol.
-Yes?

771
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,374
Who's prettier? Her or me?

772
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,044
Both.

773
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:43,879
Is Na-dan pretty?

774
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:46,882
Yes, he is.

775
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:49,092
Is this coffee pretty?

776
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,138
Yes, it is.

777
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:54,139
Darn it.

778
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,476
Why did she slap me?

779
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:01,855
You've never dated anyone, have you?

780
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:02,939
Can you tell?

781
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,107
Hey.

782
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:08,528
Then what about you?
Have you ever dated anyone?

783
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:13,950
She's pretty too.

784
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:38,642
Goodness.

785
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:41,269
Jeez.

786
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:44,147
I called her through the security office,
but she didn't pick up.

787
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,190
Here.

788
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:50,529
Sir.

789
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:53,699
Thank you so much
for defending me back there.

790
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:59,579
I did that to catch Shin Gyeong-ho,
not for you.

791
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:01,665
So don't thank me.

792
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:05,419
Yes, sir. I'm glad I have you.

793
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:09,464
I still haven't accepted you
as the team leader,

794
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:11,007
so don't get ahead of yourself.

795
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:13,468
Yes, sir. I'll try harder.

796
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:18,515
Right.

797
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:20,892
Why aren't you drinking any coffee?

798
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:25,147
I only drink freshly made espresso.

799
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,231
I hate cheap coffee.

800
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,358
I see.

801
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:35,365
There. Isn't that her?

802
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:36,533
It is.

803
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,206
Ms. Min Yu-seon.

804
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:46,543
It's you, right?

805
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:50,130
You're aware that Mr. Shin Gyeong-ho
was released, right?

806
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:51,840
I'm not sure.

807
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:55,010
Please bring a warrant
if you want to talk to me.

808
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:56,887
Hold on.

809
00:50:56,970 --> 00:51:01,349
Are you being blackmailed by his men?

810
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:02,350
No.

811
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:04,603
They just gave me a talisman.

812
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:05,687
A talisman?

813
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:06,813
Wait.

814
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:11,693
Did you meet this man?

815
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:17,115
No. And I'm not being blackmailed.

816
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:23,747
Ms. Min. The victim is still in the ICU.

817
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,124
If he passes away,

818
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:29,628
you'll be guilty of abetting in a murder,
not drunk driving.

819
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,422
Excuse me. I'm an actress.

820
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:34,633
If a paparazzi sees this and defames me,

821
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:36,676
will you take responsibility?

822
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,846
Is your image more important
than someone's life?

823
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:43,099
Calm down.

824
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,851
Ms. Min.

825
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:47,479
Can we go somewhere quiet and have a chat?

826
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:49,397
I have nothing to say to you.

827
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:52,275
Please leave before I call the police.

828
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:53,944
But we're the police.

829
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:55,070
-Wait!
-No.

830
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:56,780
-Let her go.
-It won't take long--

831
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:58,281
Come on.

832
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:12,963
Jeez.

833
00:52:21,137 --> 00:52:22,389
Darn it.

834
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:29,104
You were a cop once.

835
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:33,692
You said a true cop

836
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:36,361
is someone who protects both civilians
and criminals within the law.

837
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:39,155
Then shouldn't the victims
get their justice?

838
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:41,408
You shouldn't have hurt others!

839
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:42,784
Jeez.

840
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:46,580
Darn it.

841
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:48,498
I used to be like that once.

842
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:52,919
Fine. You're incredible.

843
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,796
What an amazing cop you are.

844
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:56,840
I'll hand him over to you.

845
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:58,550
I was going to anyway.

846
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:04,014
I'm not doing this
because of what she said.

847
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:07,851
Darn it.

848
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:17,444
So she got to you.

849
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:20,780
She didn't.

850
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:22,616
Don't be shy.

851
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:23,700
It's not true!

852
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:25,785
So what's our next move?

853
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:30,248
All right. Who's our bait?

854
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:33,960
-Shin Gyeong-ho.
-Wrong.

855
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,754
ACCOMPLICE
JUNG CHEONG-GI

856
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:36,755
It's Jung Cheong-gi.

857
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:39,507
Didn't we fail to intimidate him before?

858
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:40,508
We did.

859
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:44,095
No matter what we did,
he just wouldn't give in.

860
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:50,477
Where am I? Tell me.

861
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,854
Where am I?

862
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:55,899
Hey! Is anyone there?

863
00:53:58,026 --> 00:53:59,986
What's that sound?

864
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:02,197
What is that?

865
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:06,368
You hear that, don't you?
You better come clean before you die.

866
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:09,537
Who told you to fabricate the evidence
for Choi Yeong-seop's case?

867
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:11,790
Who ordered you to pin it on us?

868
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:12,832
Darn it.

869
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,043
Do you think this will make me talk?

870
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:18,380
Hurry up and tell us, or we'll all die.

871
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:19,422
Tell us!

872
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,717
-Hurry up!
-We're all going to die!

873
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:23,760
Tell us!

874
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:25,762
-The train is coming!
-No!

875
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,390
Hurry!

876
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:31,726
-Did he talk?
-Keep going.

877
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:34,562
Darn it.

878
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:47,534
Hey. Nam Han-jun.

879
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,494
Kong Su-cheol.

880
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:51,705
You can't kill me.

881
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:55,333
You're cops to the bone, so how could you?

882
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:02,882
Why do you think
he was able to hold out like that?

883
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,218
-Why?
-Because we were too gentle.

884
00:55:05,301 --> 00:55:08,054
He believes that we can't kill him.

885
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,514
That's true.

886
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:12,434
We're going to use him as the bait

887
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:14,602
to lure Shin Gyeong-ho.

888
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:17,188
What nonsense is that?

889
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:19,441
Su-cheol is the only one
who's lost, right?

890
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:20,442
Come on.

891
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:26,364
Don't expect too much of us.

892
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:29,617
You used to be so bright.
What happened to you?

893
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:31,536
She takes after you.

894
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:35,832
Listen up.

895
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,084
If word got out

896
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:41,421
that Jung Cheong-gi will hand over
the evidence to Lee Min-gyeong,

897
00:55:42,338 --> 00:55:44,591
-what will Shin Gyeong-ho do?
-He'll probably kill him.

898
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:47,635
Exactly. He will try to kill him.

899
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:50,388
That's when we'll save
Jung Cheong-gi and strike a deal.

900
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:52,015
"Come clean and we'll save you."

901
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:56,853
Even Jung Cheong-gi
will be afraid of that lunatic.

902
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:59,481
-That makes sense.
-I agree.

903
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:03,485
Operation Kill Two Birds with One Stone.

904
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:06,571
Right. Operation Kill One Bird
with Two Stones.

905
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:10,158
Isn't this it?

906
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:11,409
It is.

907
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:16,081
You tell Jung Cheong-gi
that Lee Min-gyeong wants to see him.

908
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:18,666
And you let Shin Gyeong-ho's secretary
get wind of this.

909
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:20,502
Okay.

910
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:21,795
-Got it.
-Good.

911
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:24,881
-Hey, clean this up.
-We're saving it for tomorrow.

912
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:27,133
They're going to eat this again?

913
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:32,305
CAFÉ MINAMDANG

914
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:33,848
Let me.

915
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:39,938
All right.

916
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:42,524
-Let's get a move on.
-Okay.

917
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:56,830
Where are they going at this hour?

918
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:15,265
Their security
is not as tight as I thought.

919
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:37,162
Is this an actual house or a show house?

920
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:38,705
It's squeaky clean.

921
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,461
It reeks.

922
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:49,007
Why is this room so different?

923
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,425
That's disgusting.

924
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:00,727
MURDER SUSPECT: CHOI YEONG-SEOP
ACCOMPLICE: JUNG CHEONG-GI

925
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:05,273
VICTIM: HAN JAE-JEONG

926
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,252
Brother…

927
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:30,173
VICTIM: HAN JAE-JEONG
OCCUPATION: PROSECUTOR

928
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:34,135
WHY DID CHOI YEONG-SEOP
MURDER THE PROSECUTOR WHO RELEASED HIM?

929
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:41,392
What are you scheming, Nam Han-jun?

930
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:48,358
SERIAL ARSON SUSPECT
CHOI YEONG-SEOP MISSING FOR MONTHS

931
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:10,129
What a wonderful night.

932
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:14,342
Why are they back already?

933
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:16,844
-Darn it.
-Wipe that smirk off your face.

934
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:18,388
Stop it.

935
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:36,489
Jeez.

936
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:38,366
I should take care of my skin.

937
00:59:57,969 --> 00:59:59,512
Goodness.

938
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:20,742
PROSECUTOR CHA DO-WON

939
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,752
What was that?

940
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:35,298
Is it you, Looney?

941
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:43,056
Come out.

942
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:19,258
EPILOGUE

943
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:28,267
-Excuse me.
-You startled me.

944
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:29,977
Here.

945
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:33,856
What is this?

946
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:37,735
Well, how should I put it?

947
01:01:38,736 --> 01:01:39,779
Han-jun.

948
01:01:45,326 --> 01:01:46,494
Hey.

949
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:48,705
Who is he? Your little brother?

950
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:50,873
He's adorable.

951
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:56,546
No, she's not a boy.
She wants to become a cop.

952
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:57,672
She's…

953
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:07,598
I WANT TO BECOME A COP JUST LIKE YOU
I WANT A REMATCH WHEN I BECOME ONE

954
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:11,686
Let's go.

955
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:17,859
-Jang-mi.
-Jae-jeong.

956
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:20,653
-What's wrong? Why are you sad?
-It's nothing.

957
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:23,156
Something's up. What is it?

958
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:24,699
I'm just hungry.

959
01:02:24,782 --> 01:02:26,784
-You're hungry?
-Yes.

960
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:28,453
Something's definitely wrong.

961
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:31,164
Tell me.

962
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:03,112
Why did you fabricate the evidence?

963
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:05,490
Was it really you who helped
Choi Yeong-seop get away?

964
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:08,993
If you're just going to believe
what you want, quit being a detective.

965
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:10,244
You'll end up ruining people's lives.

966
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:11,662
Tell them we'll give them
whatever they want.

967
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:13,414
I have a copy!

968
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:15,875
The whole world will know
that he's a murderer.

969
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:17,210
Just what are you up to, Nam Han-jun?

970
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:21,798
The gates will soon open before you.
The gates of hell.

971
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:23,966
What does this have to do with my brother?

972
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,469
Who are you to assume that I'm the culprit

973
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:27,553
and tell me to beg for forgiveness?

974
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,597
I'm going to prove
that Nam Han-jun was wrong.

975
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:33,851
